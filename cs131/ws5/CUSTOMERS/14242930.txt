I don't recall ever reading the development of psychosis in a character being accomplished so clearly, so chillingly realistically.<br /><br />This may be King's most symbolic, significant novel.<br /><br />Throughout the book I wondered, is this what it would feel like to be a famous author, a creative soul trapped by the tastes of fans?  One of the worst spiritual imprisonments would be to become known, loved, and sought after for a certain quality in a product, then be held hostage to that quality, to be compelled to continue to recreate, regurgitate that quality forever and forever with no hope for an amen, with no hope to ever take a tangent or get a new lease on writing.<br /><br />\\"I'm your Number One Fan.\\"  Each time Annie Wilkes said this, my hair would have stood on end if it weren't so thin, limp, and lacking, if I hadn't already pulled it all out in the first couple chapters of the book.<br /><br />If anyone understands the very essence of misery, it's Stephen King.  If anyone can impart the ultimate in that feeling in a novel, it's King.  Man, oh man, he did it.  Her put misery on the bookshelves for keeps.<br /><br />I'll bet he thanks God 24/7 that he didn't EVER write a Romance novel!  Or did he, somewhere in his deep, dark past?  Ashes to Ashes!<br /><br />Speaking of a man who writes love stories being held accountable by fans who've come to seek a certain type of plot from him, is that what's happening to Nicholas Sparks and his novel TRUE BELIEVER?<br /><br />The symbolism noted above seems to be prophetically in play.<br /><br />Has MISERY manifested?<br /><br />Is King a prophet as well as a master storyteller and major figure in the literary world?  Well, yes, most of his readers know he is.<br /><br />Some of Nicholas Sparks's fans seem to be compelled by genuine disappointment to leach the appeal out of his latest hardback, mostly feeling a lack of anticipated depth and intensity since TB didn't make them cry, as Sparks's other books have religiously done.<br /><br />I had been dragging feet about picking up TRUE BELIEVER as my first novel in Sparks's collection of romances.  The nearly daily repetition of comments about how disappointing the book was had made me believe it was not worth reading.  A few honest raves, though, kept the pilot lit for my desire to read TRUE BELIEVER (see my review) and draw my own conclusions.<br /><br />Maybe the ending to this story will be that Sparks agrees with Donald Trump's belief that any publicity helps his cause, even bad publicity.  Likely the regular rips of TRUE BELIEVER, balanced with the raves, will increase Sparks's sales, and he'll continue writing with new leases on  themes as his evolving talent demands.<br /><br />I have a question, though.  Why is criticism so mesmerizing that I swallow it whole, yet praise always feels too sweet to be real?  Is there something in that dichotomy which explains why horror usually feels honest and somehow true, while romance sometimes feels like a renewing wellspring of wishful thinking?<br /><br />Maybe we're dust to dust, with life and a few book preferences separating the entry/exit sandstorm.<br /><br />With Admiration For Craft and Shivers Forever,<br />Linda G.

As a bonus, King recommends my standby reference on writing, \\"Elements of Style,\\" by William Strunk Jr. & E.B. White.<br /><br />Leave it to King, The Master, to write this semi-autobiographical expose on authorship craft in a more intriguingly unique organizational setup than anyone else could conjure or dare. Leave it to Him to force (or else) a (sort of) \\"how to\\" book into mesmerizing entertainment; to step into the job with a horrific grab about a kid suffering ear drum puncture; and to coerce an anomaly of styles and content to coalesce into a gestalt of genius which WORKS, period.<br /><br />How can a book on writing be riveting?? Read it and see.<br /><br />King includes only those riveting parts of his personal history which have contributed to his writing career. He includes only the necessary elements to \\"teach\\" how to spark and stir creative fires. He includes only the necessary keys to his success (amazingly, he does know what those keys are).<br /><br />I was impressed with King's exposure of his method of writing from a SITUATION rather than from a precise PLOT outline; I still find myself chewing on that daring technique (though I do still appreciate a strongly plotted story).<br /><br />I was interested in his examples of bad and good prose, and agree with his praise of other works, though I reserve judgment on a few of his criticisms, and have developed techniques to take breaks whenever I need them without permanently losing a creative flow, which I can renew at almost any point if I can set up the right conditions.  (When I break through with as many Number One Best Sellers as Mr. King has, maybe my opinion on writing will be as viable as his.)<br /><br />King has many times earned the right to have an opinion on writing and to offer it for sale. Yet, he has approached this project with genuine humility, which is, to me, endearing (sorry about the sentimental slip, Oh Master of Horror).<br /><br />What do I admire most about this author, which is evident in this book? I absolutely enjoy his regenerating honesty, his uncanny originality, and his demand of himself to toss reader boredom into a black hole and perform, within his printed words, 24/7 without fail. Also love the way he sincerely and humbly exposes his respect for his wife.<br />Given what this man has endured and accomplished in his life, he's earned the best type of REST available to a human being, and I don't mean the big \\"D.\\" He deserves to be quite proud of himself. He deserves to have his thumbs permanently posed in the sides of a vest, to sit back and smile at his trail of effort and result.<br /><br />What a gift that he would attempt in earnest to share his secrets of writing success. And his uncanny self-awareness allowed him to share clearly what those secrets are, in this valuable gift for the youngest as well as the most seasoned of writers. This I say as a 2 decades professional writer and previous English and creative writing teacher who has published various articles and finished and polished 8 fiction manuscripts and has another 8 + book-length works in progress.  I'm not EVEN near King's level in the marketplace (yet), but I am a highly productive creative spirit who knows how to maintain, ride, and design the flow.<br /><br />There's always more than one way to approach any creative endeavor, and my approach to writing is similar to King's in some ways, somewhat different in other ways (I can only compare, of course, to the content offered in this book).  This insight to King's techniques exposes what works for him and what could work for other, though of course not all creative spirits.  Young writers should allow themselves leeway in deciding how to tap and work with their talents.  Creativity should be allowed to flourish, even when establishing a personal method on how to use that force, and sometimes it's necessary to forge a unique path diverging from even the greatest masters.  When I was teaching creative writing in the public school systems, I asked my students to at least try some of the established methods of writing prior to setting any of them aside to break away from them.<br /><br />Another great book which exposes a writer's path and techniques (through a novel rather than through a unique how to book) is THE NOVEL by James A. Michener.  See my review.<br /><br />What I believe On Writing has exposed better than many writing \\"how to\\" books is tapping into the Right Brain.  As I've observed the styles of many authors of novels, they each seem to be almost \\"designed\\" by DNA to work in different precise balances of Right/Left Brain.  The Left Brain wants steps, plots, outlines, plans and structure to be elaborately perfect prior to that leap into the ozone.  The pure Right Brain wants only the chaos of riding a storm of the absolute unknown, describing it as it explodes into the presence of present time, constantly changing, churning.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, telling a fledgling writer how to do it is, for me, a frightening extension of my uniqueness, because I would not ever want to hamper the growth of a maverick creative source needing by its design to walk a path not taught by any master before him.  Possibly every \\"how to\\" book should carry a warning.<br /><br />This one enters the effort in fairness, with humility and honesty, and does not say or imply, \\"This is THE only way to write.\\"<br /><br />Thank you, Stephen, for sharing your personal and professional views on writing, which expose your adept use of both sides of the brain, highlighting your ability to slip into the quirks of the Right side in intriguingly clear ways.  Not all writers can explain how that slip into the ozone happens.  Great books have been produced with various balances of Left & Right.  I love riding the Right, but every time I get totally off the Left it scares the shzzt out of me.<br /><br />With Sincere Respect,<br />Linda G.

The easy flow of Abby's sunny sarcasm, her smoothing of the satiric-edge trademark of Magdelana Yoder gave me a cozier live in, in Tamar Meyers's DEN OF ANTIQUITY series than I experienced in the Pen Dutch literary gourmet style, though both series are awesome in their humorous capture of human foibles at their least and most sublime.  What a writer!<br /><br />The mansions, restaurants, coffee or tea breaks, and munching while clueing all served to keep me reading onward, happy as a clam.  I quickly and contentedly sliped into reading along with a relaxed writer/artist who obviously has fun with her craft as she's creating.<br /><br />Considering the flow of this novel in retrospect, I'm intrigued that I recall no feeling of author angst or effort underlying the movement of plot, fleshing of characters, click of dialogue, or lay out of descriptions.  Maybe Tamar's unusual background could expalin her obvious confidence in her work and its process:<br /><br />She grew up in the Belgian Congo as a member of a missionary family, passed a childhood in that conflict-rich environment with religious upbringing, returned as a teen to the USA by force of cultural growing pains in the Congo, met her husband-to-be the first day at a US school, accomplished a MA in English, then worked 23 years to launch her two currently successful series.  What a perfect background for evolving into a literary pundit.<br /><br />I believe what I enjoy most about this series is the various routinely-natural and effortlessly-entertaining ways Abby worries out her mystery and interviews suspects, often over a meal in a luxury setting or at least one with rich aromatic ambiance of one intensity or another.  Hey.  I'm a culinary cozy addict.  I couldn't ask for more.<br /><br />Here are a couple of my favorite Abby clue-strewing scenes:<br /><br />Bubble bath contemplations with her cat batting bubbles ...<br /><br />Ex husbands' current wife gives Abby a makeover as the current \\"homemaker\\" moans over now being the other woman, while Abby soothes the angst of her exhusband's wife with whom he cheated on Abby ...  Yeah.  And the scene works with both irony and warmth!<br /><br />That's all great setting and satire, but this might take the cake:<br /><br />>> \\"I really need to smoke while I eat,\\" she (woman Abby was \\"grilling\\") said.  To be truthful, she didn't sound nasty about it at all.  Merely desperate.<br /><br />>> \\"I'm sure you'll find enough second-hand smoke to fill your dietary needs,\\" I (Abby) said kindly.<br /><br />>> She looked genuinely torn between lunch with me and a solitary pack of coffin nails.<br /><br />>> \\"Okay, you can smoke, but blow that nasty stuff away from my plate.  I mean, you wouldn't like it if I farted on your food, would you?\\" &lt;&lt;<br /><br />This was quite descriptively good as well:<br /><br />>>I exhaled loudly, for all the world sounding like a punctured tire.&lt;&lt;<br /><br />The humor in this author effervesces so easily there's probably quite a bit of it which slides right by, making second and third reading a rewarding venture.  Whatever Myers offers you can bet on its being uniquely complex, edgy and hilarious, intriguing and natural in a funny, off-beat way.<br /><br />Of course Abby's excursions & exchanges with the gay Rob & Bob are delightfully warm & funny, and the gutsy gourmet meals Bob concocts which Rob & Abby beg to avoid are interestingly mouth watering ... from a distance.<br /><br />Really enjoyed the way Abby dealt with her approach/avoidance conflict (romancing ever-after Vs dragging feet) as her relationship with trained police investigator Greg Washburn grows more intimate and skidds toward commitment.<br /><br />This is a work of sheer and simple entertainment with a backwash of stereotypes squashed and genuine relating relished.  Lots of hilarious mix & mismatch is stirred effervescently into the kettles of cuisine, means of marriage, ways of mystery, and action-packed menageries.<br /><br/>Take it.  You won't leave it for long.<br /><br />Excellent storytelling and wordsmithing, Tamar!  You prove the blessing and richness of your talent with every breath and every keystroke.  Believe it.<br /><br />Linda Shelnuttand action-packed menageries. <br /> <br />Take it.  You won't leave it for long. <br /> <br />Excellent storytelling and wordsmithing, Tamar!

In this novel published in 1930, readers were introduced to Miss Marple, an enduring, endearing fictional character who, according to the official Agatha Christie web site, was not planned by that British Dame to be an ongoing sleuth like Poirot.<br /><br />As creative spirits learn from writing fiction (especially a lengthy novel or a series of them), some characters aren't molded from the writer's flesh, blood, & brain waves.  They forcefully, almost immediately, steal away from the author's plan and initiate a separate life.  The author has a choice to either work from that character's direction, or lose the living, energetic force of one of those precious gems which sometimes slip into our gravity-lush worlds from surrounding ethers.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm one of \\"those,\\" an author/parapsychologist.  But that's beside the point.  Getting to it ...<br /><br />At first I assumed the \\"I\\" in the narrative was Miss Marple speaking to the reader.  On the opening page of this pilot for what became this spinster's series:<br /><br />\\"I had just finished carving some boiled beef (remarkably tough by the way), and on resuming my seat I remarked, in a spirit most unbecoming to my cloth, that anyone who murdered Colonel Protheroe would be doing the world at large a service.\\"<br /><br />My literary lunges began wavering as the word, \\"cloth,\\" registered.<br /><br />Say what?  Is Marple a NUN?  Maybe with Vicarage in the title ...<br /><br />My brows nearly ran onto each other and sneezed from their vice-like scrunch.  Old assumptions don't die, they just go into hiding in the unconscious mind.  Have you ever wondered what the purpose is for that huge, supposedly unused, 95% of the brain?  It's very possible it was allocated ages ago for storage of useless jumps-to-conclusions which never stop jumping (picture them as pink w/huge, flopping feet).<br /><br />I did get enough of a clue to begin looking for a \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" gender in reference to the First Person in the Narrative.<br /><br />\\"My wife ...\\"<br /><br />Oh.<br /><br />Read on...  Okay.  So this \\"I\\" is the vicar.  Interesting.  Very.  So, when is Miss Marple going to do her scene entry?<br /><br />In a somewhat awakened state due to the discomfort of my tense brow line, my reading approach became highly investigative of this vicar being the \\"I.\\"<br /><br />Why.  Why tell the story from his perspective instead of Miss Marple's.<br /><br />I began seeing the genius of this use of narrative and character, as I observed how Christie subtly began introducing brain-twisting ironies in ethical issues, and exposing philosophical nuances in the vicar's character by choosing him be the eye through which the story was told.<br /><br />And, of course, throughout the book I wondered (eyebrows joined) what slight shifts in plot might have occurred as a result of Miss Marple's character-take-over machinations within Agatha's rich & complex unconscious mind.  As I read, I was fascinated-ly fixed on the fact that this book hadn't yet been consciously slotted for it's grand expansion into at least a 12 novel series, paralleling Poirot.<br /><br />In order to establish a few basics for literary-clue-contemplation, maybe I should expound a bit:<br /><br />The classic Narrative Voice for detective fiction has long been established as First Person, so, of course I wasn't surprised that this pilot used that potentially fascinating, mood-rich, diary-like, narrative style.  Most often the blues/jazz feel of this story telling perspective...<br /><br />\\"I walked (slip-slid-ed? strutted? sauntered? swaggered? slithered?) along the wet, slimy streets under cover of The Long Lonely Night...\\"<br /><br />Most often this type of hauntingly heady voice is used by the featured P.I., Scotland Yard Inspector, or amateur sleuth who carries the mystery series through his moaning, echoing soliloquies.  Due to this custom of the \\"I did this, by myself, alone & lonely\\" narrative style being almost always and absolutely executed by the main male detective (I had temporarily forgotten that female sleuths were not quite yet crawling out of the ethereal woodwork in happy hordes, not by a long shot, in 1930), I was indeed shocked and intrigued as I continued reading this novel's First Person Narrative perspective and realized it was voicing from the throat of a Vicar, rather than from Miss Marple's lack of Adam's Apple (as you would now realize I had anticipated from my 2005 perspective of what's commonly done in the detective genre).<br /><br />Due to the above mentioned intrigue and more, I believe this pilot may be one of the most enlightening mysteries to study, in Christie's repertoire of rare gems.  This First Person Narrative dance may be even richer than the Roger Ackroyd sawdust-slipping waltz with Matilda.<br /><br />The above sketched situation alone exposes the cunning complexity of Christie's mind.  Reading this novel with these questions in mind could provide the height of cerebral & cultural entertainment:<br /><br />- Why use a vicar (instead of Miss Marple) as the First Person Narrator, and expose his vulnerabilities and foibles, his more human and less godly personal thoughts?<br /><br />(As I've hinted rather extensively, for me the answer to why use 1st Person Narrative at all in a mystery is found in its prevalence and preference by so many writers of detective novels who seek to slip into the melancholy mystique expressed so exquisitely by Mickey Spillane's moody/broody Good Man, Mike Hammer, as he purrs out his stories in perfect \\"panhandler\\" pitch... and heard so eloquently in the voice of (Robert Urich) in the TV series of Robert B. Parker's Spencer For Hire.)<br /><br />- Why keep Miss Marple so much in the background and introduce her so slowly.<br /><br />- Why use a cunningly contrasting collection of elderly ladies (and a sprinkling of young ones) to expose & expand details & clues.<br /><br />- Why begin the plot of this pilot with conversations and cultural exchanges at a luncheon table (before culinary cozies had been coined or had tastefully captured the mystery market)?<br /><br />- What is accomplished by the Great Gatsby feel in this novel's introduction, effected by using a \\"proper\\" personality for a 1st person narrator, a low key character who naturally makes crisply simple-and-direct observations of psychology and philosophy, a genuinely gentlemanly neighbor of the main character (or main sleuth)?<br /><br />Yeah, in some ways these are dumb questions which could be answered easily by a surface read the novel.<br /><br />Yet, focusing on them through a leisurely read of this convoluted tale, and relishing the discoveries made by that viewpoint adjustment might enrich an awareness of how Christie so (seemingly) easily executes mysteries echoing mysteries, mirrors reflecting mirrors, and might begin to expose why she frequently focused mirrors in titles and plots.<br /><br />Loved the sensory-lush descriptions in the opening scene at a luncheon table at the vicarage, especially this:<br /><br />\\"Mary (serving the meal)...merely said, in a loud businesslike voice, `Greens,' and thrust a cracked dish at him in a truculent manner....setting the greens on the table with a bang, proceeded to thrust a dish of singularly moist and unpleasant dumplings under my nose...and she deposited the dish with a clatter on the table and left the room.\\"<br /><br />The verbiage within and around the dotted exclusions of the above quote from the opening page are as primely plush as the syntax which was included.  Please do pick up the novel and be rewarded by reading the whole of page one to observe how precisely and primly Christie develops characters with a mere word or three.<br /><br />As you read on in the plot, note how often a word or its synonym (like \\"sympathetic\\") is used perfectly to reinforce an evolving image.  Note how colloquialisms are used lushly, like the simple, very British, \\"Oh!\\" which embellishes many a dialogue entry.<br /><br />In this novel Christie exposes her moral attitude, which may be one of the major facets of her tangy talent which has endeared her into the minds and spirits of readers:<br /><br />Agatha is a rebel (likely forming her values well prior to the 1920's) against strict, ignorant, and overwhelmingly controlling, cultural mores.<br /><br />What's uncanny is how easy it is in 2005 to understand the issues underlying Christie's views, formed at the outset of the previous century, on the mysteries of death, immortality, immorality, and murder.  Like Miss Marple, Agatha was an eternal student of human nature, and that study clearly evolved to a professorial level; the proof is in the pudding of the series.<br /><br />In this series I lip smacked another pudding proof, proof that the attention span and cerebral stretch capacity of the current reader market can easily hold a thought and plot beyond a Quantum-Split-Millisecond.  This pudding can be taste-tested by observing the pages and pages of naturally-flowing dialogue in this novel.  Today's publishing industry pundits seem terrified of too much dialogue, terming novels with more than a few lines of conversational quips between a hundred pages of ACTion, \\"talking heads\\" books; they steer authors away from that style as if it were synonymous with Zero Sales or bankruptcy.  You tell me.  Is it?<br /><br />Honestly, it's a relief to read a novel written in a less chaotic age and culture than we're steeped in at the moment, to read a complexly constructed novel conceived in an age past, with long, sensual, contemplative pauses allowed for the reader, actually encouraged between short rushes of life, in contrast to the contemporary style of heart-attack-action shoved through a plot so fast-paced the ending butts out the beginning. (Einstein, did you hear that, from wherever the back of your head is?)<br /><br />Whatever happened to the pause button in life, and in fiction?  Who initiated the idea that the only antidote to boredom is shock & speed, running non-stop as if the planet's revolution would halt if we didn't manically continue pushing the ground with feet hanging over the edge of the red wagon's spinning wheels?<br /><br />Whew.  Let me out of that cart.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I can do fast paced novels; I can run with an abundance of action now and then (in a book).  It's just that I haven't lost the need to savor time, to burn that contemplative candle at one, quiet end, with a good mystery in hand.<br /><br />Mystery is in the mind; not in the foot.<br /><br />It's obvious I'm not Confucius; but my reverence for leisurely does seem more Oriental (or British) than Western.  Sunrise.  Sunset.  Both are good in their own times.  As the world turns, it's a wonder we don't all fall off.<br /><br />See my Listmania on the Miss Marple series, and my review of At Bertram's Hotel.<br /><br />Pausing with hat held in hand, in honor of happy hesitance & a harridan author born yesterday, still living today through her talking heads,<br /><br />Linda G.

Each story highlights a uniquely delightful twist, resulting in seraphim-fresh starlight (compared to the typical slobbery stuff).<br /><br />I've rarely been drawn to short stories or books with collections of shorter works. When I take time to get into a book and memorize details, I like to stretch out for a while with that investment, which is why I seek series. But, I was pleasantly surprised that each of these stories was easy to get into, easy to read, and regularly called to me pleasantly to catch another bit. This type of collection is a great way to addict readers to each of the authors presented, which might be the plan!<br /><br />If it weren't for Joanne Pence, I wouldn't have overcome my prejudice against short collections and holiday sticky syrup, so I read her story first, and savored every quarter-inch of it.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Santa blossomed Rebecca & Richie from seedlings in the Angie & Paavo series, and the match making of this odd couple was perfecto!  (Kissing fingertips in salute.).  Rebecca was the perfect female to yank Richie out of the caricature woodwork and into the hot-light-reality of flesh-and-bones.  Rebecca's displayed holiday loneliness, as she pranced around the precinct in solitary simplicity, shot an instant warmth into this reader, who had previously taken a mild dislike (as the author intended) of the female homicide inspector's romantic interference with Angie and Paavo.<br /><br />The 13th's humor was entertainingly dark enough to dim the usual garish Christmas glare of sweet & light, and it exposed perfectly the type of cloistered chuckles big city policemen resort to, to save their sleigh bells during holiday cheer, especially when they're on duty and everyone else seems to be lapping up the luxury of home.<br /><br />It was a hoot following Rebecca's periodically listing infractions under her breath, as Richie casually collected mini-crimes as her streetwise, unlikely sidekick.  The violations were merely misdemeanors, so maybe that was why Rebecca couldn't build up any resistance or righteousness, and the hand cuffs stayed in storage.  Or, maybe it was because she wasn't sure which way she'd use them once released from her (Pandora's) purse.<br /><br />Loved the funny, geriatric, non-generic Santas, aging with realistic loss of various faculties, but without loss of spirit, which made the fun poked at-and-with them delightfully tasteful, especially through the spyglasses of their hilarious Mafiosa attitudes and accents.  Being half Italian myself I can connect with the banter... though I'm not connected myself (as far as I know).  Who knows, maybe if I were connected my sci fi and mystery series manuscripts would have already been on the International bookshelves!  Yeah, yeah.  All in good time ... and company.<br /><br />The scene picked up to a higher plateau of tangy, balsamic spice, when Angie's \\"Momma Mia\\" (Serefina) brought the ingredients for edible gifts, and zapped the hilariously red-garbed, well-connected celebration with her background and presence.<br /><br />There was also the great scene between Paavo and Rebecca, \\"To be or not to be\\" too typically \\"cop\\" during the holiday season when the geriatric Mafia joins the family party.<br /><br />Loved the 13th's ending, too, with the short story ambiance closing the scene with hope and positive speculation, without losing its zing into an epistle of explanation.<br /><br />For my tastes this was delightful entertainment at its holiday best, like true Italian pastries and constable humor, a bare essence of sweet with enough anise-seedy-spice to repel the gooey, parasitic type of overdone, overwhelming sentiment which usually has me avoiding holiday collections.<br /><br />This is true warmth of spirit at its zesty best, no slobbers necessary but enough saliva for a sensual stew.  This one I like.<br /><br />And, I'm happy to report that eachof the other three entries (even though Pence's story ended the sequence) follow the R&R (Rebecca & Richie) suit of enough sauce to liven the soup.  I liked the fact that 2 of the 4 stories kept the mystery at the fore, with the romance as a non-graphic sideline; while the other 2 stories, being more romantically inclined, provided typically tangy, but tasteful sexual undertones.<br /><br />Though I've read and reviewed nearly all Pence's culinary mystery series (which is one of the reasons for my reading her 13th Santa story first in this collection), I hadn't read any of the other 3 writers' work.  I wasn't disappointed in their holiday offerings here, and am intrigued to expand my reading in the directions of McCoy, Page, and Ridgway.<br /><br />These 4 authors are mature character and story builders.  Maybe their genuine warmth and lack of hype enhances their abilities to write such sensitive human stories, without drowning in the soup.<br /><br />I could go into the same detail with each story as I did for Pence, but I've passed the epistle mark.  Maybe my gift should be to leave the other 3 to surprise, without any hype intended, except to kiss my fingertips again in salute for each!<br /><br />(Go) Out on a Limb; (Meet) The Two Marys; (Kiss) The Twelve Frogs of Christmas; (Bless) The Thirteenth Santa.<br /><br />Meet Christie Ridgway, Kathrine Hall Page, Judi McCoy, and Joanne Pence.

They often begin as colored-ink caricatures, conning the reader, cajoling smiles and chuckles.  Then the cartoons flesh out and flit through pages, sometimes slipping off flat edges of print, landing on the arms of my easy chair. They sweat; they smell like roses. They strut and stumble.  It's mesmerizing to watch those transformations, the way the author accomplishes them with graceful, subtle touches.  What a skill.<br /><br />I wondered at one point if Pence was hiding a magic Frankenstein wand (or electrical jolt stick).  I don't mean to imply that her characters are like Frankenstein, just that they are brought a distance almost as far as from death to life.<br /><br />This # 10 novel in the Angie series (see my Listmania) might be my favorite.  As is obvious by now, I absolutely loved Connie's stepping out in this one, and Max was a fantastic character. A previous financial advisor so far down on his heels his knees are beginning to worry, yet he keeps on walkin'; ya gotta love him.<br /><br />Pence's multifaceted talent is exposed well here, a complexity which I believe goes well beyond what she has been given credit for, even in her awards and in-depth editorials.<br /><br />Maybe I should confess that I don't just skim & hype books.  After a slow read in which I wallow in the entertainment, I sweat to clarify a gem in each novel, of one type or another, though some novels are definitely more jeweled than others.<br /><br />This may be one of the best in this series for drawing me in, from one heartbeat to the next. At first I had a whiff of a feeling that the Brooklyn Broad characterization was too much of a caricature, but, I thought, even if it is, it's fun and well done. Then, after about the 2nd page, Connie's personality began flickering, like having her step through a gateway from a comic book world into a classic mystery novel.<br /><br />Each character was painted deftly and quickly in that scene-one, from the three ex-con owners of the caf&eacute;, to Max, and the light steam of breathing continued through the last page.<br /><br />As I read into the smoothly developing relationship between Connie & Max, I began hoping that the interest growing around them, the warmth I felt and the curiosity about how their interaction would continue, and about the mystery beginning to brew so intriguingly but subtly from the base of their relishing a couple plates of spaghetti ... I was hoping that ambiance would develop a while before the scene faded. Of course, I was wondering if Butch's nephew (the blind date) was murdered, and like Connie, I wanted to know Max's story.<br /><br />All these \\"hopes\\" (all the \\"want-to-know\\"s) were fully developed; I wasn't let down.  The slip from scene to scene was seamless.  This one deserves multiple awards; it may be the keystone of Pence's talent which is so cohesively complex it melts like butter over croissant pages.<br /><br />Slurp the twisting, tangy noodles!<br /><br />Linda G.

Martin Bayman announced... The lentil-soybean cutlets were not a hit.\\" - Quote from Joanne Pence's pen poofing life into her newly green world.<br /><br />This 3rd book-in-series started out with a (metaphoric) bang, highlighting the captivating dud of soybean cutlets saute-tested for the menu of an out-of-the-way Inn to die in.  I'm hopeless when it comes to taste-bud-uptake-inhibitors (like serotonin-uptake-inhibitors for which Prozac did the Pandora's Box thingy?).  If you abbreviate this title, CUT, you get a reference to \\"cutlets.\\"  Is synchronicity cooking here?  Yeah, but the cutlet was meatless, until Angie waved her wooden-spoon-wand.<br /><br />Angie's open-minded skepticism of metaphysical gurus was humorously warming, and the setting of the Inn in a Gothically  remote, at-risk location was mysteriously inviting.  As usual in Pence's repertoire, fictional residents were well-rooted into emotional complexity.  I don't know how she does this repeatedly with new and old characters, but many of her plot people have enough comedic appeal to border on being cartoon-ish buffoons, and yet they're fleshed out enough to skip off the pages.  As a collective of unique individuals, these guys based in the real world, beyond the edges of phony, overdone, underdone, or irritating.<br /><br />Getting back to the guru thing, Pence gives us a peek into that metaphysical world, from an angle which would be realistic even from a skeptic's perspective.  Yet the overview's warm enough and into the gestalt enough that readers should be able to feel the ease with which an intelligent adult could slip whole (bloodless) hog into the ethereal draw of the ozone world of fruits & veggies, a world which attempts to expose the gateway to wherever we all go when our hearts stop for good.<br /><br />Does any one of us not have personal agendas?  Of course the game is to work harder to hide them in the sweet worlds in which the thing is to be a selfless, spiritual-sensitive, and to have no agenda (though bannanas are usually allowed).  Pence is no fool when it comes to human nature, and each of the new set of characters in this ghost & green setting exposed a different angle on those agendas within a gutsy-fleshy personality mix.<br /><br />We have Greg, I mean Running Spirit, and his confused, waif of a wife, Patsy.  We have Moira, a strong \\"wise\\" woman who, refreshingly, doesn't try too hard to hide her agenda in a pile of raw sugar.  We have Chelsea who grows a few needed backbone links.  Then, of course there's Reginald Vane.  Now he's a tall, dark, and shy, but not too dim Original, as they say in London-based Historic Romance novels.<br /><br />What I love about these characterizations of boney but off-beat personas is Pence's generous need to hand out realistic redemption on as many pages as possible, after and while spotlighting juicy dark sides with just enough balsamic dimming to prevent the comedy from bubbing the plot out of its heady, roiling stew.<br /><br />Pence is good.  And she's so graceful in balancing dark & light that few would take time to notice the precision of Angie Vs Paavo type nuances as they meld effervescence with caring, each giving the edge needed to avoid stagnation or singular-dimension.<br /><br />I predict that Pence's Angie series will endure well beyond the limited runs of the variety of cultural bubbles of our times (New Age gurus speaking in all channels, X-files alien DNA conspiracies, traditional ethnic social doings, etc.).<br /><br />This multifaceted author exposes these time-bound, cultural bubbles with style, class, drama, and lighthearted looks at our gardens of foibles.  None of us, not even the titanium cynic, is immune to rooting into one type of pondering or pitfall and calling it sanctuary for a while.  Pence opens the doors, windows, and sometimes the roofs of these sanctums, treads gently around the hyper-sensitive spots, and periodically chews on her toes while we laugh with her and at ourselves.<br /><br />While I allow myself to freely enjoy whatever flavor calls to me at the moment, from beef to beets to borage, I can savor gourmet veggie, and Pence gave a good bite of this here, too.<br /><br />In the conclusion, munching metaphorically, the savory-spiced Partridge had a pear stuffed stylishly in its mouth, and, while green, orange & gold ground-gems were ultimately elevated with class, no vegetables were spared.<br /><br />See my Listmania on Pence's Amalfi series; all books in order, with blurbs.

The reader wants such an enterprising, awesome gourmet grocery to be able to stay in business.<br /><br />This is a special series in the sense that it has the ingredients of great mysteries worked by Cat Marsala, an investigative journalist, and her trauma surgeon boyfriend, Dr. Sam Dividian, who wants to be married to Cat, but she's dragging her independent woman's high heels.  In some unusually intriguing ways, Cat tests Sam's ability to treat her as an equal, and his responses don't disappoint.<br /><br />This is a winner series on which I've posted a Listmania, hoping to stimulate interest in the earlier books, some of which are (VERY wrongly and unfortunately) out of print and don't have cover graphics presented on Amazon.  I was happy to see that the cover art is viewable on Ms. D'Amato's web site:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Each of the Cat novels use her investigative journalism well in presenting interesting insider tidbits into various subcultures which relate to the case/theme at hand.<br /><br />In this book, the gourmet grocery daily routine work machinations are to drool for, and the contrast to insider forensic and funereal dealings with vacated bodies is definitely an effective relief from one to the other.  How ironically appropriate (and fascinating) for a culinary mystery to dig into the dirt and jewels of two industries so uncomfortably on opposite ends of the stomach workings continuum.<br /><br />If I could use a magic wand to surge a new lease of life force into this series I would be happy to do so.  It deserves to remain on the shelves for at least a few more decades.<br /><br />Likely Barbara was at the Bouchercon (World Mystery Writers Conference) in Chicago this past weekend.  Possibly she made some contacts which will renew a publisher's commitment to this series.  I hope so.<br /><br />Linda G.

That essential difference between an approaching murderer, harboring cold-blooded intent, and an unsuspecting victim, flowng through innocent routines in oblivious abandon... the contrast was heart-stopping.<br /><br />From the bone-freezing effect of this short prologue, which is truly a hard act to follow, the evenly-plotted story and sensually-fleshed-out characters move beyond the eerie mood. The concluding whole is one of the best culinary mystery pilots on the market.<br /><br />Ironically, coffee, in some ways for many of us, is an ultimate \\"food\\" and Coyle's Coffee how-to's are a great bonus, interspersed with just the right touch, just enough detail within the action machinations.<br /><br />The novel was exquisitely executed, and within that excellence, on pages 90 - 92 of the mass market paperback lies a hidden gem of a deeply touching segment woven into a few of the facts exposing NYC citizenry's backbone of grit, and shared generosity in response to the 9/11 attack on their city.<br /><br />Indeed, the spirit of this novel was like that hidden gem of tribute, rich & balsamic, yet lightened through simple strength; sensitive to depth, yet uplifting through humor's lifeline, a necessity in the worst of times.<br /><br />I've setup a Listmania on this Coffee House series (including a bonus novel from a new culinary author, Claire Johnson, a pastry chef from San Francisco). I look forward to reading every novel in this series.  May it perk long and prosper out of the pot.<br /><br />I'm wanting to say more on this excellent novel, and to quote some of its awesome passages of prose, but possibly it's best if I leave that to lucky readers who have yet to pick up the pilot to this series.<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt	2005-09-04

It was between Paavo and a 9 year old girl, after the murder of her grandfather, in a tenement building.  The chapter containing that segment confirmed for me that Pence is not only an artist and an author, she's a master of her craft.<br /><br />On the subject of fav's, I'll quote two passages which ID, or expose the essence of Angie and Paavo better than any other I've found in the series.<br /><br />Quoting Angie's comment to Paavo, on page 231 of the mass market paperback:<br /><br />>> \\"I want so much to do interesting things ... I want to be accomplished, an achiever.  I want to be a person who is independent and successful, and good at her job - not daddy's privileged little rich girl.  Not that that's so tragic.  But I'm more than that, aren't I?\\" &lt;&lt;<br /><br />Angie is a special character in many subtle and easy-to-see ways.  I was annoyed by a reader's criticism that Angie is annoying.  My first reaction to that comment was, \\"How wrong and how rude!\\"  More than enough opinions weigh in favor of Angie being a capturing character in every nuance.  In this novel, both she and Paavo continued to grow in warm, cozy, and realistic ways.<br /><br />Paavo's personal pondering:<br /><br />>> Home.  He wished he didn't get a kick in the gut each time he thought about the cottage.  He liked being there more than he ever dreamed he would, and more than he really wanted to admit.  He had found a place away from the world's cruelty and losses where there was love and laughter, and he wondered how long he could accept it, or if he would soon want to retreat to his own quiet solitude once more. &lt;&lt;<br /><br />Yep.  That's Paavo.<br /><br />I might add a note here that, for me, retreating into quiet solitude is as much, possibly more, a part of what I need in a home as love and laughter.  With intuitive wisdom, Angie gives Paavo all of this, a safe, comforting place to rest or hide when a cocoon is needed for a time, and a safe place to play.  The first she gives in sensitivity but not easily; the second she gives with easy, natural relish.<br /><br />TO CATCH A COOK.  To catch, to capture, to get, to comprehend.  Is catching something like \\"getting it\\" or like identifying it?  Yep.  Yes.  You bettcha.<br /><br />Yeah, this was one of my favorite books in the Angie series, mainly because the mystery of Paavo's childhood was so intriguingly and realistically dealt with.<br /><br />Pence has an ability to create emotional catharsis within intrigue. Her series exudes warmth and wit, as noted in my Listmania title, before I changed it to, \\"Joanne Pence Mystery Series; Better Than Nora Roberts.\\"<br /><br />Pence has something beyond those qualities, though.  Charm?  Yeah.  Complexity?  Yeah.  Vision?  Yes.  But, what word am I hunting for here ...<br /><br />Is it somehow the true essence of Mystery that Pence is so good at capturing?  I can say that no mater how convoluted your brain, you could never imagine the history Paavo has been given in this book.  And, yet it fits every other piece in the puzzle of this series, in not only the books which came before TO CATCH A COOK, but also in the ones to follow.<br /><br />How does she do this?  How does Pence evolve a mystery which deftly and faithfully carries threads and symbolism  throughout a series, without even being conscious of all the machinations herself?<br /><br />She's an artist.  She's an author.<br /><br />Maybe it's as simple and as convoluted as that.<br /><br />Twists?  Pence has a corner on that market.  She tied this plot into so many interesting knots I'm surprised she was able to get out of the Gordian herself.  Of course she did it.  It almost felt as if she danced her way through a family labyrinth, then hopped onto the kitchen table to finish the footwork.<br /><br />I began to see in this book, in sequence to others read prior to it, how amazingly Joanne is able to slightly change the styleand mood of each story, yet retain the essence and evolution (the identifying factor?) of wherever this collection is headed.<br /><br />Never say life isn't symbolic.  Never say fiction doesn't reflect life.  As Joanne says, \\"Life Happens.\\"  And so it does.<br />As she sows, so shall she write.  And we reap the entertainment.<br /><br />Thankfully, I have a few more Angie mysteries to read in past offerings in this magical series.  If I'm finished with what came before, what will I ever do after I finish reading the latest Angie novel (tentatively set to be published December, 2006)?<br /><br />Stay tuned.  There's more to life than meets the eye.  Once in a blue moon, trite gets the last word right.<br /><br />Yeah, but here's the REAL conundrum:<br /><br />How do you identify something precisely and accurately when it has an intense evolutionary factor, through which its identity is doing the metamorphosis thing?  Will Joanne's series end up with butterflies or dragonflies on the covers?  And what do they eat?<br /><br />Here's why, to me, Angie is a life-blood refreshing character:<br /><br />As a prior teacher of English Lit, I've tried to understand the reverence of Literary Novels, \\"Classical Literature.\\"  Could rarely get into most of the stuff because it was too depressing. I was seldom (if ever) in the mood to voluntarily depress or deflate myself.  But sometimes I tried to read those hefty tomes, like HEART OF DARKNESS by Joseph Conrad, Graham Green's novels, F. Scott Fitzgerald's GREAT GATSBY. I read enough to see and appreciate the masterful use of the language; I drooled over the exquisite beauty of the syntax, plots, and character complexity.  But I began to feel disgusted, angry, and betrayed at these truly great authors who seemed to believe they had to write (probably in an alcoholic or drugged haze) with such graceful severity about the bowels of the Earth, always ending with a spirit leaching, evil panache.  I felt like jumping off a cliff to get away from the doom of the no win life they portrayed.<br /><br />It appeared to me that to write great literature was to be ugly serious and to travel through beautifully executed  words, but to use them only within the down sides of life. The words themselves must have felt trapped in hell.  Or executed.<br /><br />After I've exposed that opinion, would anyone wonder why I like Angie?<br /><br />There are ways to write about the deeper, darker sides of life without steeping the reader's psyche into the sourest soups of reality, and committing him there for eternity. Is our cultural heritage sick or what, to believe so strongly in that type of literary curse?  The term, \\"crying in your soup\\" is trite, but it fits too many of the \\"classics\\" too well.<br /><br />But, okay.  Certainly there's a place for depressing literature, for dredging the swamps of life.  I really don't want to condemn southern exposures (actually I loved that Alaska TV series), even though I'm not drawn to it (as a rule), and have rarely forced myself to read every page of those types of novels.  In college, Cliff Notes literally saved my life a few times.<br /><br />What I'd like to see in addition to these types of Pulitzer Prize offerings, is more Great Literature with the type of mood catharsis Joanne Pence accomplished in the urine touched tenement scene in TO CATCH A COOK, when the well set stench transformed with a single sentence describing the clean aura of the apartment in which a 9-year-old girl sat.  Pence gave that apartment a feel of purity, a distance from tenement soullessness, even with the girl's grandfather lying dead in the next room. Yet, Pence had spared no odor in the detailed painting of the ugliness of life in that world.  She painted it as it should be exposed.<br /><br />Then, in that single sentence, with a few carefully chosen words about the lack of leftover food cartons, she lifted the hopeless despair into something still truly sad, but somehow refreshingly healing and quietly cathartic, even as the girl was dealing with that gut wrenching situation.<br /><br />The author moved the plot further into this emotional purity within the simple exchange between Paavo and the girl.  He knew how she felt; he had lived it.  He also knew how to be with her, what to give her, yet to avoid breaking her difficultly maintained composure, to avoid dishonoring who she was and how she had come to deal with her life with a loved but un-pampered child's simple and serious dignity.<br /><br />That scene was so powerful, I was heavily reluctant to leave it.

Shelnuttn the down sides of life. The words themselves must have felt trapped in hell.  Or executed.    After I've exposed that opinion, would anyone wonder why I like Angie?    There are ways to write about the deeper, darker sides of life without steeping the reader's psyche into the sourest soups of reality, and committing him there for eternity. Is our cultural heritage sick or what, to believe so strongly in that type of literary curse?  The term, \\"crying in your soup\\" is trite, but it fits too many of the \\"classics\\" too well.    But, okay.  Certainly there's a place for depressing literature, for dredging the swamps of life.  I really don't want to condemn southern exposures (actually I loved that Alaska TV series), even though I'm not drawn to it (as a rule), and have rarely forced myself to read every page of those types of novels.  In college, Cliff Notes literally saved my life a few times.    What I'd like to see in addition to these types of Pulitzer Prize offerings, is more Great Literature with the type of mood catharsis Joanne Pence accomplished in the urine touched tenement scene in TO CATCH A COOK, when the well set stench transformed with a single sentence describing the clean aura of the apartment in which a 9-year-old girl sat.  Pence gave that apartment a feel of purity, a distance from tenement soullessness, even with the girl's grandfather lying dead in the next room. Yet, Pence had spared no odor in the detailed painting of the ugliness of life in that world.  She painted it as it should be exposed.    Then, in that single sentence, with a few carefully chosen words about the lack of leftover food cartons, she lifted the hopeless despair into something still truly sad, but somehow refreshingly healing and quietly cathartic, even as the girl was dealing with that gut wrenching situation.        The author moved the plot further into this emotional purity within the simple exchange between Paavo and the girl.  He knew how she felt; he had lived it.  Healso knew how to be with her, what to give her, yet to avoid breaking her difficultly maintained composure, to avoid dishonoring who she was and how she had come to deal with her life with a loved but un-pampered child's simple and serious dignity.    That scene was so powerful, I was heavily reluctant to leave it.  As the story moved forward, I found myself wondering about the little girl, but the continued shifting of plot was more than enough to keep me busy and fueled.  The girl's return in a few potent vignettes artistically and satisfyingly concluded her part in the story, as one of the symbolic links to Paavo's past.    This is a gem-in-the-crown of a series fit for royalty among readers.    Bless the best among us as we each evolve toward unique exposures of personal perfection,  Linda G. Shelnutt	2005-08-21
US	14242930	RDY6RFJU03B7J	0061044539	303239291	Cooks Overboard (Angie Amalfi Mysteries)	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	Brain-Dancing With Grey Cloud Finesse	This novel opened with a dramatic, brow-puzzling change in Paavo's character.<br /><br />The change was so perfectly etched into flawless syntax and so absolutely unexpected, it zapped the buzz wizz chaos of my reality, welded it into a reading focus, and snapped me into the book before I could get a clue on what hit me.  I was glued to Paavo's every lifeless word and rare thought as Pence polished his presence as a lackluster blob of nothingness.<br /><br />Who was this guy dragging around a dead attitude of non-investment-in-anything-suspicious, shuffling around with a drool-grinning acquiescence of whatever slithered up to him?<br /><br />Due to the effective hook of this Paavo puzzle, COOKS OVERBOARD was more fast paced than some of the other novels in Joanne Pence's Angie Amalfi series.  I was compelled to surge my reading speed because I absolutely had to know what had caused Paavo to become to this lost soul, sleepy non-entity.<br /><br />Angie's antics sidestepping around and hot-footing into Paavo's dead-weight dullness was entertaining; her lively spirit was used well with poking, prodding attempts to re-connect to a Paavo who seemed to no longer be THERE.  If I didn't have a feel for the outer limits of Pence's parameters for ozone travels into the paranormal realms, I'd have wondered if Paavo's body had ingested an alien being, or been possesed by an evil spirit.  I was given just the right amount of access to Paavo's thoughts, in just the right amount of plot spacing to be strung along nicely without becoming impatient.<br /><br />In addition to be carried into the plot by curiosity about Paavo's personality switcheroo, I easily slid into the vicarious venue of being aboard a freighter rather than a cruise ship.  Lacking the garish, boorish, carnival brightness of the typical cruise mood, the no-frills freighter developed quickly into a surprisingly full-bodied fictional world.  Pence made good use of the ambiance variances of the freighter Vs cruise setting by detailing the dining locations, types of menu, cabin arrangements, passenger interaction, etc.<br /><br />The vignettes of subplots off ship were woven into the ocean going machinations in a Sidney Sheldon like manner of kaleidoscopic alternation, in a style similar to that in TOO MANY COOKS, yet with an even deeper development of each alternate scene.<br /><br />With the freighter's ambiance being naturally grey and grim (no cruise-ship forced-color or pushed-pace), and with Paavo's focus being so off (more like lost in a fog), and with the sinister vignettes given more plot space than Angie's typically hilarious romps, the resulting gestalt was intriguingly darker than prior books.  The cloudy, grey-scale worked fascinatingly to keep me anesthetized into the story.  It almost felt like I lived the plot in an equal intensity as Angie and Paavo.<br /><br />If I were to conclude that Pence's storytelling talent is multifaceted in mood management, I would be making such an understatement, the conclusion might cartwheel into a kaleidoscope.<br /><br />(If you can make sense out of that statement you may be a literary Black Belt.  I've gone overboard in desperation to prove my own writing skill, and seem to have made a splash in the pan of discontentment.  But, hey.  I've got steam.  Wanna hear me hiss?  My mood is so sour sugar has gone on strike.  Or maybe it was vinegar that made the vignette off the scene.)<br /><br />With the above conclusion about Pence's multifaceted mood management having fallen into the miasma of my dysfunction, I'll conjure another wrap by mentioning the bonus in this novel:<br /><br />In addition to all the above, this mystery is a Russian-accented, spy-thriller.  Yet, even with the humor and well done \\"v\\" lisps, COOKS OVERBOARD is too capturing, too grey-scale, too well-done to be called a spoof.<br /><br />Maybe what this work does best is prove Pence's ability to brain-dance through a repertoire of fast-steps (what she accomplishes is not mere wordsmith-ing) which choreograph into a plot complexity and character metamorphosis \\"to die for.\\"<br /><br />Jaw open-and-shut in chirping amazement, I'll always be ready for more engrossing twists of sentiment, or even \\"more of the same\\" from Joanne Pence.<br /><br />Linda G.

At \\"Murder in the Grove\\" in Boise, Idaho, June 10 & 11, 2005, the first writer's conference I attended (after two decades of writing), I happily waited in a line at Barnes & Noble to purchase this novel and have it signed by Carolyn Hart.  It is the pilot to a very special mystery series, and I've put off writing my review because I doubt I'll be able to adequately highlight this mystery pilot's evolution, beauty, and entertainment value.<br /><br />I'm overwhelmed by the fact that I saw so much as I was reading this book, in and between the lines, so much depth and symbolism, so many issues brought to mind; I could tangent round trips to Tangier on a multitude of subjects.  Yet, I was enjoying the read so much the first time through, and it slipped into such a Right Brain Zone, I was void of invitations from the Left Brain, logical consciousness, to record or analyze as I was reading.<br /><br />The story was so cohesive I still resist \\"tearing it apart\\" to compliment the fascinating details which kaleidoscope-ed in fleeting thoughts as I read.<br /><br />Maybe I could kick start myself into expressing how this novel and Mrs. Harts evolution to it effected me, if I excerpt from an E-mail I sent to Carolyn Hart on June 20, 2005, regarding her keynote speaker presentation.<br /><br />>> As I mentioned to you at the conference, your luncheon speech was one of the best I've heard (including all the presentations I've heard in any venue, not only those on writing subjects). You're a gracious, lovely lady (as well as brilliant).<br /><br />>> In preparation for the conference, I had read the history on your web site, about your path to the Death On Demand series.  Even though I recognized some of your statements from that preview, your heartfelt, professional delivery brought them alive so wonderfully that I laughed out loud when I wasn't holding tightly to my emotions to avoid blubbering or sobbing aloud in empathic agreement.<br /><br />>> Truthfully, my favorite success stories are any type of following the deepest well of the soul in every detail, as a last resort.  Loved your litany of, \\"It won't sell anyway, so I might as well write it as I want to.\\"<br /><br />>> As I'm sure you know, I wasn't the only one whose face and manner was an emotionally open book in your luncheon audience.  (A Literary Agent) Bob Mecoy surprised me most with his subtle facial expressions and body language radiating respect, admiration, and genuine caring for you and your path. It was his touching emotional response to your words which told me I'd love to have him represent my work. &lt;&lt;<br /><br />On June 22nd I wrote to Carolyn, in an E-mail titled: \\"Beginning DEATH ON DEMAND.  LOVE it!\\":<br /><br />>> I've begun DEATH ON DEMAND, and am relishing the development of Annie and Max as separate characters, and the delightfully slow (though not too slow) evolution of their relationship. In addition to character development, I found your contrasting moods and pacing, and the intrigue in the first few chapters to be definitely capturing, with suspense set beautifully.  And I love the setting of Annie in her unique, dream-come-true mystery bookstore, in such an inspiring island ambiance. &lt;&lt;<br /><br />On July 8th I wrote to Carolyn, in an E-mail titled: \\"(My) Amazon Reviews in Temporary Sludge\\":<br /><br />>> I have mentioned in a prior E-mail that I've finished and loved DEATH ON DEMAND (which I picked up at the Boise Murder In The Grove conference, along with a copy of your latest hardback), and am looking forward to writing a rave on it under Amazon's Customer Reviews.  That's still the case.<br /><br />>> I'm itching to do that one because it is special. I really love Annie & Max, the bookstore setup with the mystery scene paintings game, the use of an uncannily representative collection of a variety of mystery writers as suspects, as well as the mentions of reality mystery titles and authors and use of them as guides in solving the currentmystery. And, of course, the mystery itself was beyond engrossing entertainment. What a multifaceted gem! &lt;&lt;<br /><br />All right.  I've got my kick start, which has light bulbed for me that the best way for another reader to see the beauty and fun in this book is to read it.  So, I'm not going to write another book of detail on it, maybe just a TINY chapter.<br /><br />What I will say is that what remains in my mind is the subtle way Hart played with the big questions for which murder mystery writers seem compelled to somehow find an answer.  Of course, The Mystery underlying all detective novels is, \\"Why do people kill each other?\\"<br /><br />Hart's contemplations involve the main contrasts in human personalities and behaviors, one of these being the conflict of maintaining a dedication to work and duty, Vs wondering how to \\"retire\\" well, or how to live a moral life if/after one wins a Lottery huge enough to make earning a living something of the past.<br /><br />Max is Annie's lottery ticket; he's an Angel protectively dogging footsteps of innocents.  Annie, being an independent, feisty woman, doesn't know if she wants to win an attractive male who loves her to pieces.  She's already won him, and she wants him, but what does she fear in having him?  Is her aversion to his ability to effortlessly, guiltless enjoy his money a trumped-up distancing device, or does it represent a soul deep fear about The Life of Riley?<br /><br />This pair is the epitome of Serious Vs Playful.  Do most humans have a fear of the seductive diversion of play? Are we afraid, like Annie seems to be, that Evil slips in door when we're not being serious? How many of us want to just relax and enjoy life, but are afraid to.  This book was so subtly stimulating on this conundrum that a related question surfaced for me:<br /><br />\\"Is murder the ultimate evil?  Or, as in Stephen King's PET SEMATARY (my review 10/16/05), is blocking death's door an even darker deed, using unnatural means to contain a soul too far beyond the ripe time for final exit?  How do we know when that time is ripe?<br /><br />As probably all of us have felt, the attachment power of love is potent.  Is this one of Annie's fears of allowing herself to accept Max into her life as a soul-mate?<br /><br />Beyond the questions this novel deftly brings out of denial, the narrative and descriptive scenes are realistic and brilliant, with either color or dingy grey/black tones.  The scene of Annie being attacked was as vivid as any you'll find in any crime novel.  Yet, Hart's effected realism is not that of overextended, overdone visceral gore.  And, speaking of reality, isn't the elevation of every-day-routines in cozies a more true type of real life exposure than repeated hits of mutilation or constant terror of it?<br /><br />One of my favorite lines, as it worked within the scene sequencing, was from Max, \\"Even if I don't have a serious job - like a banker.\\" (Page 140 in the paperback Bantam Crime Line edition, Feb 1987.)<br /><br />What I noticed as strange in the novel as I read was that I felt very little at-risk-angst when Annie was in danger, and I liked that reading comfort, for reasons I wouldn't be able to explain succinctly, if I'm even sure what they are.  Maybe I don't like being TOO on the edge of my seat when I read?  Yes, the scene of Annie getting head bashed, and the murder scenes are artistically, literarily, classic-mystery \\"alive\\"; which might translate to mean they were somewhat staged.  Yet, all this worked absolutely for a mystery novel offering.<br /><br />At one point my interest, which held totally throughout the novel, was heightened as I felt Hart was working into an answer to some of the big Whys, with Annie's serious nature contrasted to Max's \\"Why do you feel I need a job?\\"  What are the moral (and other) dangers of getting too far away from duty and responsibility?  What is the ultimate face of evil?<br /><br />The keystone shenanigans of \\"lassoing\\" the murderer, and the butting-head-bull-dog-standoff at the culmination of the culprit comprehension gave perfect twists of surprises among a great collection of such.  It's obvious Hart had a great time with this novel.  And, that's what I believe insures that the reader will do the same.<br /><br />Of course it should be noted that Carolyn says she bad-mood-agonizes over the first draft of her books and only begins to relax and enjoy the work after she's got the story snagged and begins the later drafts to polish the creative surge into literary perfection.  Hart has proven repeatedly that she can create and she can polish.  Can she ever!<br /><br />Good job, Lady!  For many more reasons than I've surfaced here, this novel is a keystone, maybe The Keystone in the mystery genre.  The Death on Demand series is going to be a touchstone for me for quite some time as I relish each of this series in order.<br /><br />I'm finished with this review.  Sigh.  I don't feel I've done justice here to the parameters of perfection in this pilot, but I can do justice to reading every book in this series.  That'll be easy!<br /><br />Thank you, Carolyn, for having the courage to write from the heart, possibly in ways only great artists could endure or imagine, and for your communication with an author still on the path.<br /><br />Linda G.

US	14242930	R30DHABUGU1O2B	0060092165	101556657	Two Cooks A-Killing: An Angie Amalfi Mystery	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Sweating Plastic Snowflakes; Skidding In Sticky Goo	Absolutely enjoyed the expansion of Angie's character in TWO COOKS A-KILLING.  Pence gave Paavo's history a focus in TO CATCH A COOK; in this book she gave Angie a stretch of space and plot.<br /><br />I continue to be entertained by the changing nuances in Pence's style in each of the books. Most series novels seem to plot a pattern and stick to it, or at least they follow a composition type to a \\"T.\\"  But, each of the Angie books has a unique identity and \\"talking\\" technique, and each one works.  Maybe most readers won't notice the writing method changes, but they're fun for me to pick up on.<br /><br />This book seems to have less of the Sidney Sheldon type of scene shifting which Pence seems to enjoy playing with; the generally uninterrupted narration in this novel gives a pleasantly slower pace than the other books I've read. In the case of this story, the smother flow of scene changes fits the character development, plot, and theme, and made the reading, for me, even more pleasant and the capture more absolute; it made the story ease along naturally, so I was more relaxed reading this novel than the others.<br /><br />To relax while I'm reading is a definite plus, and that cozy mood does not take away from the interest or intrigue. For an author to successfully work a sensual pace yet keep interest kindled is truly an art, especially in a market climate in which more, more, more speed, shock, action, and gut ripping seems to be demanded of authors by what feels like a profit-panicked-industry understandably terrified of keeping up with TV's RC. Could write a book on that subject, but better get off it for now.<br /><br />Each of the Angie books has its unique, more-than-the-others qualities, so I can honestly say I love each book and haven't found one yet which seems to \\"work\\" less than the others in any way, in providing good escape reading enjoyment with tidbits of complexity and depth to munch on.<br /><br />However, it's been said by folks wiser than I that most series contain certain books which feel better or less than the others.<br /><br />That thought has niggled at me each time I pick up a new Angie book, wondering, \\"Will this be one of the ones which isn't as good as the others? If so, why?\\"<br /><br />Of course, since my mission seems to be to find the heart or core of value in each novel, I'm looking for that, and am aiming to be able to \\"christen\\" each with honest, 5 Star raves.<br /><br />Speaking of core value, Joanne Pence certainly accomplished a coup working a springtime reality into a winter plot!  The seasonal-contrast-tension from an April-living-scheme shoved seamlessly into a December ambiance fueled one of the best banquet bashing scenes I've ever read!  I'll never doubt it.  Pence is a master of contrast.  She knows when/how to build and relieve tension.  She pushes, drives, and manifests her talents in amazing and thorough ways.  Was she the first to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear?<br /><br />LOVED the tasty detail in that food fight scene!!<br /><br />What an ingenious slant on collecting suspects at a dinner table with an amateur sleuth chef trying to shift the  spotlights, after she has thoroughly tantalized readers by dramatizing the cooking process of a several course gourmet meal.<br /><br />And what author can make a serious scene of the culprit conclusion hilarious and riveting?<br /><br />Joanne Pence!<br /><br />She outdid herself with flights of food, resulting in the best of that type of slapstick situation I've read anywhere.  Usually in-your-face food fun isn't appealing to me, but the way Pence did it, and the irony of having a culinary mystery use this technique was just fantastically, ironically appropriate. It's intriguing (and fun to me) that the author gave more detail in more vivid syntax in the food scenes which trashed culinary coups than she usually does in the eating/prep parts of plot.  For Joanne Pence, it does appear that \\"Cooking is murder\\"!<br /><br />As funny as the banquet brawl was, the contrasting scene with Angie barely defying death as she dangled out a window was equally riveting in a serious, \\"Oh my God!\\" way. With Pence's obvious love for contrast I shouldn't have been surprised that she'd cancel the flowing tide of the whole novel's sensual pace and comfy coziness BIG TIME in the ending sequences. It almost felt like she was tired of the easy, almost sweet (and I loved it) flow of the whole book and got pissed off with the plot not being jazzy enough for her standards (though it was for me) when she got to the ending phases of writing. So, she got out the whips and chains and jazzed UP the action and angst several plateaus in the denouements, with lightning-fast stepping and pizzazzy-fancy maneuvering.<br /><br />What a fun book!<br /><br />I've been noticing that each sequential book in this series seems to add more to the culinary hits.  The taste bud  input grows more and more into balsamic levels of gourmet-chef-delicious.  Pence must have a collection of foodie contacts somewhere, or a great cook book collection; maybe it's all the cooking shows on TV.  Surely she watches Lidia's Italian table once in a while! (She did mention Emeril in this one.)<br /><br />Salute to The Master of Style Shifting,<br />Linda G. Shelnuttow was equally riveting in a serious, \\"Oh my God!\\" way.

US	14242930	R29NYBJC2OIQ0E	0451197550	283399963	The Hand That Rocks the Ladle (A Pennsylvania Dutch Mystery with Recipes)	Books	5	0	3	N	N	Skinny-Boobed, Barren, Non-Cook Reigns In Culinary Cozy	Tamar Myers gleefully gets away with spoofing (in good taste) the Amish, Mennonite subcultures.  I'm thinking those communities might proudly read this series, loving Magdalena Yoder's religious outrageousness and pokes at their shared background.  Myers gives a delightful view of this culture's ability to bubble with fun just under the surface of what they believe to be necessary religious severity.  Maybe everything needs a relief valve.<br /><br />Misquoted idioms are the forte of Freni, Magdalena's cook, who is also a relative; according to Magdalena, most people in a small Mennonite community are related.<br /><br />Instead of \\"taking a page out of their book,\\" Freni suggest to Magdalena that \\"You should take a page out of their dictionary.\\"  The people referenced as having the right page/dictionary from which to \\"take\\" are an Amish family who have shunned a relative who has installed rubber tires on his buggy.  It seems that in this case rubber tires are too much of a lazy luxury.<br /><br />Might that be why Myers doesn't quite allow herself the gourmet luxury Diane Mott Davidson relishes religiously in her series, with Goldy Schulz catering at the helm?  Maybe it's too sensual to watch a character wallowing in luscious details in a cooking process simultaneous to getting a clue.<br /><br />Or, possibly everyone has a different little bit of heaven to take to earth.<br /><br />In August of 2002, after I had read all available Goldy books, I turned to other culinary mysteries, picking at what seemed to make them tick in readers' minds.<br /><br />In that collection, THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE LADLE had the most fetching cover (along with Davidson's CHOPPING SPREE).  I had noticed right off that Magdalena Yoder was certainly spunky; no character dud there.  She had one of those zany, punny, dunning senses of humor expressed in every catchy turn-of-phrase.  She had this reader spinning, wanting to pick up every verbal nuance, which served as a great diversion to remembering that the game was to catch CLUES, instead.<br /><br />Yet, I also noticed fairly quickly that Magdalena didn't discuss food detail much; not like Goldy, who analyzes the mystery while liberally offering the reader sensual moans of culinary tastes, smells, and textures.  In fact Magdalena didn't cook, at all, and she was barren (and unmarried) to boot.  As noted above, the touted cook at the Pen Dutch Inn was Mag's aunt (or older cousin?), Freni.  As a Mennonite, Mag's an entertaining anomaly.<br /><br />The included recipes from the Pen Dutch were indeed GOOD.  On page 23 of the paperback, \\"Bubble and Squeak\\" is featured, which is a gooey, flavor-lush, potato-pancake-thingy fried in bacon grease.  In a footnote Magdalena cautions:<br /><br />\\"For a heart-smart, low-fat version use only the potatoes, cabbage, and onion.  Fry in olive oil.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, \\"heart-smart\\" is right.  The heart \\"smarts\\" or hurts when we deny it tasteful fat.  As preached by me, the heart loves cholesterol; maybe scientific research just hasn't noticed the right angle, yet, of that brain-product.  Often we don't want too much fat; \\"greasy\\" makes the stomach roil.  But sometimes, maybe when the body and heart need the intense cohesiveness of animal fats (contrary to current medical mania, I have the gall to believe there's not truly a bad Vs good cholesterol distinction), our taste buds REQUEST it.  But that may be too heavenly a concept for the current masochistic mood of flavor-phobia.<br /><br />How did we arrive at this everything-good-is-bad-for-you mode of pushing a life not worth living?<br /><br />In my continued reading of this Pen Dutch mystery (with recipes) I began, at one point during a menopausal heat wave, to become impatient with the constant verbal cuteness.  The style was beginning to feel more like cartoon caricature and less like full-bodied escape fiction.  Of course I knew that cozies didn't develop a habit of offering visceral escape; partly because characterization and relationships weren't easily developed within the strictures of that genre.  (Until a few hungry authors found a way around that conundrum, possibly beginning with Rex Stout, Lawrence Sanders, and Virginia Rich - see my Listmania on Rich.)<br /><br />Based at her Penn Dutch Inn (with recipes), Mag severely shook the fibers of the envelope for multifaceted characters as she stuffed in the \\"loose\\" Mennonite driving a red BMW, a non-cook who's rarely present to run her Inn.  Even so, that composite did work, more than well.  As I steeped into the fantasy of a Mennonite female with a Jewish-mamma attitude, a female who was barren, skinny-boobed, and spunky, I began noticing an involuntary process taking place, a redesigning of my menopausal brain waves.<br /><br />Myers seems to be compelled to constantly transform dichotomies; as soon as the reader begins to \\"peg\\" or stereotype something, an opposite, non sequitur is successfully slid into the mix:<br /><br />A Reader might well ask:<br /><br />\\"Do I have his right?  This character is a MENNONITE driving a RED BMW?  Shouldn't a Mennonite female be sitting, spine-aligned in severe pose beside a bearded Man directing a stodgy horse hitched to a buggy?<br /><br />\\"Is this a CULINARY mystery in which the main character can't boil water?<br /><br />\\"Okay, so here's an unmarried Mennonite who is barren, lost her virginity to an English later discovered to be married, and is sexually pursuing another English who might be uncovered as the murderer in the mystery?\\"<br /><br />Irony, dichotomy, twists, whatever you want to call them, Myers appears to love that quirky flavor of nonstop metamorphosis.  And, she is GOOD.<br /><br />This technique is fascinatingly effective for breaking through old stereotypes and preventing new ones from gaining momentum.  Maybe that is the Myers Mission.<br /><br />My early problem as a reader was that I continued trying to settle into some type of comforting, cohesive \\"sameness\\" so that I could escape my daily routine stuck-ness, escape the parts of my life which were less than entertaining or not \\"there\\" yet.<br /><br />Maybe that's the problem with satire when it goes over the line (if it has a line) from light into heavy.<br /><br />There's a point at which the reader is able to identify with the good guys in a novel, and to find a fall in place for living in the plot.  But, in the case of bitter, biting satire, none of the characters are what a heroic-natured-person would want to internalize.  (Though this is not the case here.)<br /><br />In pure satire the reader doesn't want to root in and nurture himself by becoming part of the fictional world through the main character.  Instead, the reader, by defensive necessity, remains aloof from grating characters in a world in which everything is cuttingly wrong.  To root in, live, and drink the nectar from that type of environment would be to willingly pollute the psyche by feeding it the exact poison which the heroic fictional world is normally meant to extract.<br /><br />This may be why purely satiric fiction draws a smaller audience, in an elevated cerebral ball park. Yet, satire often becomes blockbuster popular when it's presented in nonfiction form.  Possibly this is because readers don't automatically root themselves deeply into nonfiction and LIVE there, as they attempt to do with fiction.<br /><br />Nonfiction produces an intellectual, generally non emotional experience; fiction lives viscerally in the mind of the reader.

Oh my.  Maybe severe satire should be absorbed \\"above the neck\\" where nonfiction \\"lives\\"?<br /><br />Yet the sweeping success of Robin/Calista type of satire proves that the right balance of gentle cutting can blend into lifting and brightening, enough to anesthetize the breakthrough/release of time-solidified-barriers of warn-out thought and the damagingly-dead dogma of historically seated poisons.<br /><br />Please excuse the agonizingly analytical turn this review has taken; hopefully I haven't reined out too far, as I snap the reins further.<br /><br />The Myers Penn Dutch series appears to balance the line of satiric fiction well enough to win a large audience, if her commercial popularity is an accurate gauge.

A terror of impending deprivation hit me in 2002.<br /><br />I was craving savory surges in a steady diet of taste bud notifications, and feeling the well was beginning to run dry!  I was at that horrifying point at which I was finishing the last two books available at that time in Diane Mott Davidson's Goldy series, a series to which I had become helplessly addicted.<br /><br />What could I do but search for culinary mysteries beyond Goldilocks Catering.  Hitting pay dirt (while hiding dust bunnies), I began a study of 5 novels, each in a different series.  I thought I was in heaven, at least I would be if I could get my needy taste buds into FIVE more culinary series.  I'd be set for life, depending on how far my DNA regenerators (HGH?) would take me.<br /><br />Since that time I have settled into a number of exquisite culinary collections, and am continuing to broaden my tastes well into the many and growing off shoots of the mystery genre, since I'm no longer quite as desperate for textual pablum to accompany a mystery.  I do still wonder, though, how one is able to expend the energy to solve a mystery without eating SOMETHING.  Maybe it's true that \\"Man does not live by bread alone,\\" but this woman would like to.<br /><br />My well-breaded notes from that auspicious time in 2002 began ...<br /><br />Joanne Fluke's STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE MURDER is a well designed story, with the plot and characters carrying the entertainment escape; any interjected word play remains in the background, in service to the tale, which is how I like my escape novels.  Yes!<br /><br />The style isn't overdone in witticisms as I felt at first was the case with THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE LADLE (My review 7/17/05).  Yet, the style of Tamar Myers's culinary series, as proven by sales success, is \\"just right\\" for a large majority of mystery fans.  I'm confident that, as I read more in Myers's series as I plan to do, I'll come to like that style, will probably even get to craving it, though heaven forbid I should become a victim of that hormonal chaos again!<br /><br />Do I want to want it; or do I not, that craving of something for which the supply might stop at a moment of horrifying desperation.  Was that the question?  Indeed.<br /><br />Well.  I suppose precariously situated craving is preferable to guaranteed boredom, or an inability to get it up, as they say, or into a new style of escape fiction.  Of course, the female's ability to get it up or into is symbolic rather than real, but, whatever.  Here I am, and there you go, always needing a reading fix.<br /><br />Any type of style intensity, as it pleases its veterans, can turn off a reader not accustomed to it, yet it's often the case that taste broadens as a reader expands his horizons.  Unfortunately the feet and rear sometimes expand too, as the distance from the youth of sunrise increases, and a sunset life chapter seats in.  I suppose it's true that due to that strange phenomenon of years advancing, with me having no choice but to go along with them, I'm maturing and widening my taste complexity.  Go figure.  My figure has.  Gone.<br /><br />What used to be dry, too pun lush, or too deep or dark has become pleasingly intriguing, hilariously funny, or satisfyingly pensive.<br /><br />All this is to say that I'm looking forward to an advanced ability to relish Tamar Myers's series.  I'm already highly impressed with and ready for more of her exposure of the fascinating Amish culture.<br /><br />Is wandering off the subject part of expanding one's horizons?  Possibly.  But, okay, I'll return to the clearly delicious subject of this review.<br /><br />The Hannah character owns a cookie store, and while her cookie recipes are creatively luscious, my sweet tooth was underdeveloped (at that time in my 2002 youth) due to the savory ones taking precedence.  I found myself missing the savory intensity available in luxuriously satisfying amounts in Phyllis Richman's WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA HAM, my review 7/12/05.  See also, my reviews of Richman's other two Chas Wheately novels, MURDER ON THE GRAVY TRAIN, 4/2/05; and THE BUTTER DID IT, 7/16/05).<br /><br />However, I predict that STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE MURDER, due to much more than the fact that this offering is faithful to genre dictates (and reader expectations of it), will continue to live well in a successful series, along with Tamar Myers's Amish offerings.  There are hoards of sweet tooths and cookie mongers out there, as well as diehard wit afficionados, likely enough to keep both Fluke and Myers running off at the mouth for a while yet.<br /><br />(I was right on that prediction made in 2002; both those culinary series are still going strong, which is more than I can say for myself in too many ways!)<br /><br />Okay, so STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE MURDER, even with it's tongue drooling sweets, might not target the cravings of certain salty readers.  So what.  Anyone who can't be easily cajoled to a strawberry shortcake treat may be dead!  Drool, that's my favorite dessert of all time.<br /><br />I've recently (in 2005) read my second, third, etc., in Fluke's Hannah series.  My sweet tooth has arrived, Swensen style!!  Thankfully I have a character flaw which has saved my butt (from collecting 16 tons); I'm too lazy to bake.  Vicarious is good, for me.<br /><br />If you want more detail of the precise appeal of some of the Hannah novels themselves, without the irritant of my slipping tracks as I've done here, feel free to review my rave on PEACH COBBLER MURDER, 5/14/05, and follow the cookie crumb trail to my other Hannah raves.  YELLOW MERINGUE PIE MURDER, 3/20/05.  FUDGE CUPCAKE MURDER, 3/22/05.<br /><br />Here's a quote from an exquisite Publisher's Weekly review on this novel.  With a 2001 copyright, they were ahead of me in \\"getting it.\\":<br /><br />>> Tempting descriptions of meals served at the local establishments, mouth-watering recipes and a warm family of characters ward off the vividly depicted bitter chill of a Minnesota winter. &lt;&lt;<br /><br />That review is worth reading in its entirety; I could quote every word and give gushers of praise for writing style and a right on analysis.<br /><br />Before I step off this Amazon page, please allow me add a few comments from the heightened maturity of my current character!<br /><br />Index finger in midair, I pause in the presence of now to note a fascinating parallel between this shortcake confection and Diane Mott Davidson's series.<br /><br />The main suspect for Hannah to clear is the abused wife of the murdered man (the victim who died with his head mushed into a plate of Hanna's shortcake).  We know Goldy carries a banner throughout Davidson's series, that of catalyzing a healing process of the battered wife, especially when her husband is a respected professional in the community.<br /><br />I find this connection to Goldy's banner, of Hannah sleuthing to clear a battered wife of suspicion of murder, not only an intriguingly symbolic parallel to Goldy's cause; Hannah, proves herself to be up to winning the culinary cozy game, or at least running neck-n-neck with Goldy.<br /><br />So, forget everything I drooled here about sweet tooths Vs savory needs.  Focus on the editorial by Publisher's Weekly.  This rave was just for fun!  It's made me want to reread the novel from my 2005 perspective.

A Soul Food Finish	Listen my children and you shall hear ...<br /><br />... the morning munch of a mangia mystery (following boisterous stomach rumblings).<br /><br />Join me in a gourmet walkabout.  I'm hedging through a garden LABYRINTH, lush with the steaming aroma of freshly buttered, almond scones; set with a collection of Italian demitasse cups of bravo-bean espresso, and whatever your stomach growls for.<br /><br />The Key for this labyrinth is in Phyllis Richman's THE BUTTER DID IT, the Haut Cuisine of the culinary mystery genre.<br /><br />But, wait.  Go slowly.  The path to the key should be more yummy than the fait accompli...<br /><br />Davidson-type culinaries had always offered an effortless gateway to Goldy's world.  Maybe it was my simple background causing affinity with mysteries in which the protagonist communes with friends and family, and works out her problems around lush descriptions of food preparation processes in her gourmet kitchen.<br /><br />I grew up in THE MALT SHOP, a Colorado small-town restaurant (complete with ice creme fountain), Bus Depot, and Bakery owned by my mother and her two sister's.  The fountain area had a long counter of green-marbled linoleum, accompanied by a collection of red-vinyl-topped stools, upon which customers could spin fast circles, and which were bolted to the floor to prevent unplanned flights into the oak-framed, glassed-front bakery cases behind the string of elevated seat tops.  Sitting atop one of these stools, a customer saw his image inside a 12' X 20'  heavy mirror.  Also reflected were sage-green, ceramic milk-shake-mixers and a red-trimmed, silver-tin-can of pure, powdered Malt.<br /><br />Oh yes.  The classic scene.  And I lived there.  Home was a green-marbled counter-top accompanied by spinning red-stool seats.<br /><br />After graduating college, and moving to Portland, Oregon with my first husband, I had been given a treasured birthday gift from my mother-in-law, who was a lovely woman named Hope.  She paid for a one-evening Julia Child cooking seminar held at a Kitchen Kaboodle in Beaverton.  Seated on comfy stools surrounding the teaching kitchen, seminar participants watched an exquisite, full dinner meal plus dessert being conjured by Julia, an extravaganza which was served at the culmination of the high entertainment of Julia at work with her special brand of culinary magic.<br /><br />If you're like me and you must know, she seared, then roasted a pork loin in a super hot, fast oven, finishing the saliva surging meat within a half-hour, transforming it into a dark, toasty, thick crust containing a juice-dripping, blushing-pink core ...<br /><br />Possibly these experiences conditioned me for a particular craving of mysteries featuring plot-active chefs as investigators, or some variation on that theme of using food preparation as part of the sensual appeal in the novel.<br /><br />There is a major difference in a reading mood between visceral sensual appeal, based from the stomach and intestines, and cerebral pun/wit appeal, or other appeals based in the cranium or in the other senses.  This may be why I've been pushed to look for more of Davidson's Goldy Schulz.  And, now, most definitely I'll drool for more of Richman's Chas Wheatley.<br /><br />I've found that many cozies on the culinary bandwagon don't cater an over abundance of food flavor fun, using word-space to work them sagely into the plot.  Once I realized that Richman and Davidson were the main authors who impregnated plot with detailed chewing and cooking, I was freed to enjoy other offerings in this tasty side-genre, relishing the alternate \\"flavors\\" they provided to munch on or labyrinth through.<br /><br />So far, Phyllis Richman's offerings are my favorite food flavor fix; THE BUTTER DID IT has risen to the top.<br /><br />What captured me (with a huge sense of relief), beyond the fantastic food futzing, was the adult appeal.  The Butter wasn't X-Rated, except for surging desire for the flavor, a pleasure which has been turned almost criminal.  It featured adult professionals working with adult problems in The World.  Instead of being habitually fed adolescent angst and family abuse, I was given professional machinations to chew on, situations to which the forever adolescent within me might aspire, and in the process have hormonal angst shoved into healthy accomplishment in the grown up (sort of) world.  I mean, look at Davidson's Julian; he's making that transition.<br /><br />And, who wouldn't want (in fact or fiction) to be a restaurant reviewer in a politically posh East Coast City?  Would it be torture to have a newspaper editor sign expense slips for meals tabbing up several hundred dollars each, including beverages and companions?  Well, yes, as Chas dramatizes, being paid well to eat regularly a la gourmet  does have its drawbacks.  But, in fiction, one gets the flavor, minus reality's tragic downside (gravity).  Ah, the essence of escape fiction.  Such a deal!  You bet!<br /><br />But, did the Butter do it?  Did cholesterol kill the chef with a heart condition?  Precisely what did kill him, and how does that relate to the current conundrum of butter bashing?<br /><br />Apologizing to the near religious pitch on global cholesterol phobia, I confess.  I'm not afraid of butter.  Without reservation, I love it.  Forget the plastic puke in phony parodies.<br /><br />Not only do I love butter; I need it for brain function.  Someday we'll be reading about butter as a cure for crime.  I kid you not.  Casting off pseudo, Science is already jumping on the newly-painted, gloriously-gutsy gypsy wagon with brightly-colored signs:<br /><br />\\"The brain is 90% cholesterol; it's a GOOD thing.  It runs the nervous system.  We in the scientific community made a mistake in interpreting the purpose of its overwhelming presence around heart problems.  The cholesterol surge was actually the body's do-it-now patchwork-cure, a temporary fix until the soul could break through and begin its habit of making clearer choices for taste, on a quick, minute-by-minute basis.\\"<br /><br />(The soul's inclusion in the signs was my insert.

Pick up the tiny clue that I'm not the only one who knew that cholesterol phobia had to be an oops due to scientific method slipping on a banana peel.<br /><br />It's likely that many culinary mystery authors sense this truth.

She may also hold a Key (Richman's Butter holds the Master Key for food flavor focus) to the design of this labyrinth, but I don't want spoil the fun of figuring out why.  Her novels have a well-balanced complexity, a bit of everything, including a richly balsamic smattering of gourmet taste touches, all minus seasonal chaos or treat clashing to spoil the broth.<br /><br />That said, I no longer cringe when I say, Bon Appetite!<br />Linda ShelnuttWorld.

Her novels have a well-balanced complexity, a bit of everything, including a richly balsamic smattering of gourmet taste touches, all minus seasonal chaos or treat clashing to spoil the broth.    That said, I no longer cringe when I say, Bon Appetite!  Linda Shelnutt	2005-07-16

On the back flap of my copy of this paperback is a quote from Mysteries By Mail:<br /><br />\\"Jane Jeffry is a cross between Miss Marple and Erma Bombeck.\\"<br /><br />That comment toots-the-bugle on target, and the 1993 copyright date sets the receding edge of the Bombeck boom, a blip in the Quiche resurrection, and the finality of my age at 57-years-and-slipping ... cuz I fondly recall all of this too clearly, and with more than a few happy chuckles and taste bud awakenings:<br /><br />  -- Generous segments of hot Swiss cheese oozing within egg custard set warmly into a fresh & flaky, crisp pie-crust-shell ... Oh, yeah!<br /><br />  -- Macho bacon chunks holding tangy barriers between melted, creamy goo, and souffle-ed to a steaming, lightly bouncy, moist egg fluff ... Uh huh.<br /><br />  -- Soft hints of nutmeg nearly overcome with glee by freshly sauteed, almost crunchy, slithery garlic and green onion pieces ... Ho, ho, ho.<br /><br />Tim Taylor lives!<br /><br />(And is dated with fond memory, in the kitchen, by the oven, within the ambiance of this review of a culinary cozy, thank you Lord!)<br /><br />Ahem.  Excuse the slips through drooling saliva.<br /><br />Returning to the above quote from M by M...<br /><br />Miss Marple is another story (beyond and before Erma).  Rather than nicely seating an age-flavor as Bombeck has done so well, Christie's Marple is ageless and forever famous ...<br /><br />... except to a young editor at Penguin who rejected a ms because the protagonist, at 55-years, was too old to appeal to mystery readers.  Huh?  Penguin, I love your Tuxedo, and that ms deserves a second chance to dance!!<br /><br />Pretend I didn't slither in that last paragraph.<br /><br />If you want to read something timeless and ageless, though, something which exemplifies the best of many crossover worlds bleeding into each other in a classic mystery scene taking the suburban housewife into her own where she'll never be underestimated or overwhelmed again ...<br /><br />If you want to be impressed with how stark-salient-simplicity, and routine-real-life might be successfully lived and easily prioritized, on an easy fly, within the-gracious-hostess-role played with panache ...<br /><br />If you want all that and more, read (and reread) the Last Chapter of A QUICHE BEFORE DYING.<br /><br />I'll quote a few passages and comment upon the depth and complexity which can be easily missed do to the smooth ride of the jazzy rhythm and snappy-blues of Jill Churchill's voice.<br /><br />Not to worry, though, I won't give away even a hint of any part of the plot or denouement which needs to be kept under raps for the mystery threads to remain intact, to be unraveled only as you read this book from page one to the end, which I recommend \\"to no end.\\"<br /><br />Chapter 21 begins:<br /><br />>> \\"Mom!\\"  Katie called from the living room.  Mike and Todd are being repulsive again!  They're such dweebs!\\"<br /><br />>> \\"It's their nature,\\" Jane called back from the dining room table.  (Note that Jane doesn't leap up, zip upstairs and micro-manage, like those fictional super Mom's we know too well, in response to this whine & conflict; nor does Jane's heart surge into a cholesterol calling frenzy.  She's cool.  And wise to no end.)<br /><br />>> \\"I'll help you clear this up,\\" Thelma said, surveying the dirty dishes and general wreckage of Sunday dinner littering the table.<br /><br />>> \\"No hurry, Thelma.  More coffee, Uncle Jim?  Mel?  Mom?  (See Jane easily side-step Thelma's push to put process before people, to clear the clutter rather than leisurely running the course on calls to hostess.)<br /><br />>> Shelly came into the room.  \\"I've got my gang off to the pool.  May I invite myself to dessert?\\"  She sat down at Kate's abandoned place and helped herself to a microscopically thin wedge of strawberry pie. &lt;&lt;<br /><br />Those few words expose volumes in such a free-flowing syntax, it's easy to notice only subliminally that Churchill is dramatizing Jane's wise-and-easy style of Mom-ship; her casual expression of understated, gracious hostess-ing; her deft diversion of the Mom-in-law maneuvers.  Jane accomplishes all this without missing a cue (or clue), without controlling, micro-managing, or bashing budding brains; she steps and sidesteps with grace, on-the-fly.<br /><br />Did you SEE that??  See Jane?  See Jane run?<br /><br />That last chapter deserves to be reread with a certain amount of regularity, each time I want to be reminded of what a murder mystery was meant to do.  Jane not only accomplishes all the above, she regularly gives a hell-of-a-good answer to life's habitual conundrums.  And, if I read between the lines with enough care, after-thought, second and third thoughts, I see the subtle wisdom there which is so cashed in nuance to have caused The Suburban Housewife, Jane Jeffry, and Jill Churchill to be underestimated with the \\"under\\" so LOW as to have been buried.<br /><br />On that note I'll wind down with advice to myself:<br /><br />Remember the phrase, \\"... coming down with.\\"  It can be seen as (only one of many) a subtly repeated clue to the Churchill/Jeffry mystique.<br /><br />Remember and wonder, Linda:<br /><br />\\"Why Jane, (of all people)?\\"<br /><br />Why Jane?<br /><br />\\"Who is John Galt?\\" (From ATLAS SHRUGGED -- Ayn Rand)<br /><br />This series deserves to be reproduced in an elevated version of a new and complete hardback collection (along with the one I've bugled that Joanne Pence deserves, along with the one Joanne Fluke has been deservedly given) ... with this review as a preface!<br /><br />Oh my.  I'm flying high this morning.<br /><br />But, trust me when I say that I mean (more than I can say) every word of praise to Jill.

As Churchill writes:<br /><br />\\"... and from the basement there was the sound of some lonely item of clothing with a metal button thrashing around in the dryer.\\"<br /><br />The kitchen phone's ringing and ringing to the backdrop of Max the cat twitching deaf ears to his world, as he fishes for tidbits in the garbage disposal.<br /><br />As the prose continues, perfectly posed details continue to surface like gifts unwrapped and abandoned under a holiday tree, in this Normal Rockwell presentation of a suburban sanctuary, a lifestyle nearly abandoned to extinction, a lifestyle which Jill Chruchill has deftly preserved in her Jane Jeffry cozy mysteries.  The suburban housewife may have been stigmatized by a culture gone manic, marveling only at the more macho role-playing-pursuits for the female side of society's equation.<br /><br />But, thanks to Jane Jeffry, the suburban housewife has regained her status, she's been regenerated with a smirk of satisfaction, at least for this reader.<br /><br />And what is the time of the year for the metropolis rejected homemaker to be in full regalia with an ungodly number of holiday balls juggling in the air?  You got it.  Christmas is fast approaching.  The season's just-like-clockwork overwhelm for those heroic Moms harrying homemaking routines carried on beyond the boundaries of skyscraper heaven has just surged to the hosannas for Jane, as an old school chum sets up housekeeping in Jane's home, tagging along a new found son who's packing into a chip on his shoulder more hostility than Goldy's Arch (from Diane Mott Davidson's series) could ever dream to drudge out of his derriere.<br /><br />The plot weaves through Jane's ongoing projects, the main one setting up a charity bazzar for her church, her teenagers' ongoing noises of various symbolic and real expressions trailing behind their paths through hormonal oblivion, and the interjection of this old friend she hardly knows, her son from Hell, and I can't recall what all else.<br /><br />With each Jane Jeffry novel I read, from the early offerings to the latest, I'm amazed at how easily her plots spread along under fingertips turning pages, how simply and lightly entertaining they seem to be, while subtle symbolism and thematic machinations seethe under the fast rhythmic flow of the surface.  It's so EASY to miss the depth.  But, make no mistake; it's there.  You may want to look for it.  Finding it might be more rewarding than the entertainment buzzing through the pages as they flip themselves so you can read with less effort.<br /><br />These JJ novels seem to parallel the constant and pervasive underestimation of the suburban housewife, that role which can be played successfully only by the most complex personalities among us.<br /><br />This book is ripe with the ambiance of holiday cheer mixed inexorably into the deepest wells of human angst and anomaly.  Please forgive my repetition, but I'm still in conundrum about how this series can be called light, while I add my conclusion that it is.  What a magician of a flickering glow and contrasting darkness Jill Churchill weaves into A FAREWELL TO YARNS, as she contemplates fame Vs abandonment and anonymity, as she pulls an amateur afghan into a last minute, real and symbolic success.<br /><br />Cheers to you, Jill; my hat's off to your subtle skill,<br /><br />Linda G.

US	14242930	R2KVSYKNL8ZGGM	0060183896	560861138	Who's Afraid of Virginia Ham?	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Indonesian Lamb in a Dense Red-Brick-Sauce	Probably what catalyzed the bonding process between heroine and reader was that I was reading peacefully simultaneous to taking slow bites of  lime-and-fresh-cilantro-laced, yogurt \\"dip\\" for the cayenne caramelized, Cajun chicken featured at THE RED ROBIN...<br /><br />Yet, that entre presentation, as yummy as it was, was like a dented \\"old hat\\" entree compared to Chas' LA \\"foodie\\" chefs offering gourmet Indonesian imprints with lamb in a dense red-brick-sauce, unlimited large, circular, flat-but-spongy bread (of some luscious sort, with a foreign name I would have been able to type-in here if I hadn't LOST that paperback!) used instead of utensils and plates for holding and scooping a collection of multicolored, exotically flavored, spicy-pureed-veggie dips.<br /><br />Imitating a satisfying wine, this novel gave a fine finish as an easy, light-entertainment read, and the denouement rose well above the plot leading up.  I did not expect that the final chapter to be dramatically different in depth and complexity than preceding chapters, though I had hoped the ending would live up to the excellence of the rest of the book.  I was shocked that the ending was a plateau above the fantastic machinations leading to it from page one.<br /><br />Way back in Once Upon a Time Land, in 2002, when I began needing something similar to Diane Mott Davidson's Goldy novels, this was one of the first culinary mysteries I was able to get into.  I was craving taste hits, even more than Goldy gives, but some of the culinaries I found at that time pointed tentatively at a food item, then moved away without satisfying that need for every nuance of flavor.  It's the taste on the tongue, in the mouth, the chewing and moaning I was seeking.<br /><br />Richman's \\"hamming it up\\" stuck to my emaciated ribs and put my appetite on Prozac.  Yet, the munching references didn't push me to eat more in reality; I don't know why.  I had finally found a culinary cozy which went beyond that simple, taking a bite of bread into ...<br /><br />\\"... easing teeth into the spongy texture of a warm, yeasty baguette, with feathery soft center and the cracking crunch covering ...\\"<br /><br />The above is my statement; I did not lift it from the ham novel, though I could quote a huge number of better ones than the above.  If you want to read those, please feel very graciously shoved to go buy the book!  You'll find them in nearly every chapter.<br /><br />Many culinary offerings I found with recipes included didn't even have the \\"taking a bite of bread\\" part.  They might stoop to discussing clues over dinner, or around a mug of coffee; but the reader has to assume without a word that the brew is steaming, maybe even hissing the essence of the freshest beans from Baghdad.<br /><br />I should note here, though, that all the culinaries I read, even without constant drool hits, had plenty of other types of escape fiction draws to fully satisfy the most saliva deprived reader.  It just took me a while to let go of my craving for details on the bite of bread.  I still don't know why I was searching so obsessively for that sensual touch, but I have a few brain sparts on the subject, which I will put aside for now.<br /><br />The first several paragraphs felt like a nose out of joint.  A female character was disgruntled that someone in her newspaper office had followed personal \\"soul drives\\" and put out something before this character had picked up a pen, let alone risked the failure, and expended the daily effort to initiate, carry, and complete a product.  Instead of \\"I did this\\" (the child's voice in the TV ad), this journalists was spitting the soured, more mature motto, \\"I could have done that ... better.\\"<br /><br />The point was, she didn't do it.  This character didn't write her \\"soul package\\" until several others had proven its dramatic draw, at which point the \\"After Chevy\\" product often carries the bitterness of competition-timing-lost.<br /><br />At first, the charactersin this Virginia Ham novel felt like the embittered \\"could have been firsts\\" if they had followed their souls regularly.  Yet they rarely do, and remain in a constant state of nose twitching, gravel ax, disappointment.  This type of crusty, urbane, Great Gatsby type character doesn't appeal to me, at least not as much as Davidson's \\"real\\" people who continually invest in a moment-by-moment LIFE, like continuous cleaning ovens.<br /><br />I hoped I was wrong, though, and that possibly I was imposing my own \\"sour grapes\\" at having been following my soul all my life and producing, producing, producing, but not manifesting (yet) a big launch of my work.<br /><br />I retained Hope that this \\"ham\\" series would capture me with characters and plot as well as or better than Grafton and Davidson's works had.  It had been refreshing to find mysteries flavored well enough to come alive for me nearly as easily as the Historic Romance biggies always had; I used to read at least 3 of those/wk, with Julie Garwood and Amanda Quick being my favorites.  Mysteries had always read more slowly for me.<br /><br />I continued reading WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA HAM during a solitary lunch at the RED ROBIN, and, without noticing right away what was happening, I became cozily \\"bonded\\" with female character, food critic columnist, Chas Wheatley.  It didn't take many pages, though, to begin realizing that this capture had taken place as a result of author Richman's artfully exposing a just right vulnerability around the Chas \\"touch cookie\\" trait.<br /><br />And, I had NO idea that LA sported the world's most expensive restaurant with a set $300.00 fee for any dinner.  I was sufficiently chagrined into being grateful that my not being a sophisticated-cultural-savant would be slightly shored up by reading Richman's Wheately series.  Trailing an aroma of small town nativity, it's not that I don't treasure my rich but homey background.  However, along with lots of other readers, I'm happy to be able to appreciate the LA \\"out there\\" collection, without letting go of the Linus blankie, the long enduring, simple comfort foods... like Sloppy Joe's...

US	14242930	R1AQDRRZC46VCS	0743475127	721394190	Beat Until Stiff	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Rank Laundry Does The Zombie Smash; Meringue Peaks Rising	Sometimes I don't realize that characters are cardboard-ish; actually they aren't, until I read a sharply contrasting, fictional live-wire like Claire Johnson's Mary Ryan.  Mary is unerringly real, balanced perfectly between guts and sensitivity, with a snarky sarcasm which feels so natural and so right on, it doesn't reduce her to being too edgy to live with.  Beat that!<br /><br />I've read and loved all of Sue Grafton's alphabet mysteries featuring Kinsey Millhone, and Diane Mott Davidson's Catering mysteries featuring Goldie Schulz.  I'm hooked enough to purchase their new hardbacks as soon as they come out.  I didn't expect to find a female sleuth I liked as well as Kinsey and Goldie, but I have.  (Actually I've found several, but in this review I'm focusing on a very welcome newcomer to the genre.)<br /><br />By the time I had read about a quarter of the way through BEAT UNTIL STIFF, I was viscerally implanted into this mystery pilot driven by the antics of an addictive Mary Ryan, pastry chef at a premier San Francisco restaurant.  Edging beyond the best of both Kinsey and Goldie, Mary folded into an anorexic, Type-A-hypertension, a complex richness, realistic vulnerability, not overdone grit, and sheer character appeal.<br /><br />By the time I had read half-way through the book I really, really LIKED Mary.  I kept asking myself why, since this type of hyper-angst is usually so edgy it's off-putting if not repulsive.<br /><br />By the time I was three-quarters into the book I was feeling that rare dread of not wanting to finish the read without owning a stack of sequels and having number two ready to open as I close the last page on BEAT UNTIL STIFF.<br /><br />It fits that Johnson is a pastry chef, because her novel exposes the sense of rhythm, design, contrast, and timing required for success at her level in San Francisco's culinary culture.  I was hoping it was possible, but wasn't certain if an \\"up there\\" chef could incorporate those skills into writing escape fiction.  Now I am.<br /><br />Attempting to put my finger on exactly what solidified Mary's addictive appeal, I kept coming up with her being almost too true to life as an emotionally unstilted, free-wheeling, strong-within-the-depth-of-untethered-vulnerability, female.  She seemed to dance a spontaneous, serendipitous choreography through an onslaught of trials and tangents, the main one being a realistically pervasive, reeling, rocky healing process from the shock-power of an absolutely unexpected divorce.  She flowed, through both pain and pleasure, yet did not ever, not at all, seem over-planned or staged.  I'm in awe of this character who clearly exposes that the author cannot be far behind in embodying a delightfully-rich, magnetic hypersensitivity.<br /><br />This glorifying praise of Mary Ryan doesn't even begin to address the other aspects of BEAT UNTIL STIFF which are outstanding for a true gift in escape fiction.<br /><br />- There's the depth of Johnson's cultural open-minded-ness, honoring the Latino strength in the culinary industry without martyring them into a repelling political agenda (which would sour both the \\"cause\\" of escape fiction and the cause of a valid industry expose).<br /><br />- There's the fun and feisty relationship between Mary and her friend, inspector O'Connor<br /><br />- There's a well-run, tightly-plotted, fully-satisfying mystery.<br /><br />- And we have the bonus of a snarky, sarcastic woman who, surprisingly, has an appealingly warm connect with her Irish mother.<br /><br />What else could we WANT??<br /><br />There's yet more to this story, but this should be enough to recommend the purchase and read of BEAT UNTIL STIFF.<br /><br />The only reservation I'd offer, in all fairness, is to warn of that feeling of dread of having to finish reading the book without having 10 more Mary Ryan mysteries to buffer the loss of finishing the book without knowing there'll be a backup collection.  Even so, ya gotta read this!<br /><br />I'll leave with a wish about the cover artwork on both the paperback and hardback of this book:<br /><br />- The paperback's cover presentation is awesomely perfect in style, color coordination, and typesetting panache addressing title, author, and text detail; it fits both the chef ambiance and murder mystery gestalt.  But the knife-in-the-back, and stirring of a soup pot does not fit the plot detail.  Those images made me feel that the artist, as fantastically as his skill is portrayed in \\"to die for\\" perfection, did not read the book.<br /><br />- There's a similar problem in the cover of the hardback.  While the photographic presentation of a smiling chef breaking eggs into a bowl is absolutely, drop-drool-GORGEOUS, and though it does fit the title's reference to beating eggs for meringue, the happy chef mood would indicate a cookbook rather than a better-than-classic murder mystery.<br /><br />Johnson deserves an artist as dedicated to her series as Joanne Fluke's artist, who is said to have gone to the trouble (more like rapture) of feeding his artistic inspiration by baking the recipe featured in the murder, then eating the confection while he's leisurely reading the novel.<br /><br />The artist on the BEAT UNTIL STIFF paperback, Joe Bailey, is better than the best.  If he were allowed the time to savor the book to the degree that he has developed his exquisite style, in my book he'd be at the top of the heap of book cover artists.  In fact, I'd be more than honored, I'd be ecstatic to have him do the cover on my mystery pilot!  But, ya gotta READ the book!<br /><br />Truthfully, I originally put this paperback on my Amazon Wish List because of the beauty and appeal of the cover art, even though I hadn't been totally locked in by too quickly skimming the first few paragraphs online.  I just felt that a book with this gorgeous of a cover HAD, just had to be good. (Upon finishing the book I see those first few paragraphs as perfecto!)<br /><br />Listening to Claire Johnson talk about her novel at the recent Boise writer's conference, \\"Murder on the Grove,\\" I was intrigued by what she said about what she wanted to put into the book and why she had written it.  I was drawn mostly to the fact that Johnson trained at a premier chef school and worked in the kitchens of San Francisco restaurants.  Wouldn't it be fantastic, I thought, if a real chef at the top of the game could write a great culinary mystery?  It is great; she did it.<br /><br />Johnson solidified the deal by handing me a copy of her paperback, as attendees and featured authors were exiting the book signing area of the conference.  I was so touched by this gift, and her manner of giving it, that I set aside the excellent mystery I had been reading, and opened Claire's book the evening of the end of the conference.<br /><br />BEAT UNTIL STIFF has a great publisher, Poisoned Pen Press, and exquisite cover artist, Joe Bailey; Claire Johnson deserves the best they can give in support of her offering.<br /><br />Okay, all right, already!  I've broken even my black hole boundaries beyond brevity.<br /><br />But, I HAVE to make two more compliments, one to the warm and genuine acknowledgments by Claire, prefacing her story; and another to the perceptive Introduction by Barbara Peters.  Both attest to the awesome characters and talents backing this book.<br /><br />Barbara opened her introduction by beautifully exposing her personal expertise (and great writing skill).  Then she built upon the below statement with a fascinating prelude to BEAT UNTIL STIFF:<br /><br />\\"One thing I've noticed over the years I've been selling, and now publishing mystery, is the nexus between murder and food.  What you eat or drink can kill you ...\\"<br /><br />Latest news flash is that the copies of the paperback may be limited, but Amazon has a few left.

I was drawn mostly to the fact that Johnson trained at a premier chef school and worked in the kitchens of San Francisco restaurants.  Wouldn't it be fantastic, I thought, if a real chef at the top of the game could write a great culinary mystery?  It is great; she did it.    Johnson solidified the deal by handing me a copy of her paperback, as attendees and featured authors were exiting the book signing area of the conference.  I was so touched by this gift, and her manner of giving it, that I set aside the excellent mystery I had been reading, and opened Claire's book the evening of the end of the conference.    BEAT UNTIL STIFF has a great publisher, Poisoned Pen Press, and exquisite cover artist, Joe Bailey; Claire Johnson deserves the best they can give in support of her offering.    Okay, all right, already!  I've broken even my black hole boundaries beyond brevity.    But, I HAVE to make two more compliments, one to the warm and genuine acknowledgments by Claire, prefacing her story; and another to the perceptive Introduction by Barbara Peters.  Both attest to the awesome characters and talents backing this book.    Barbara opened her introduction by beautifully exposing her personal expertise (and great writing skill).  Then she built upon the below statement with a fascinating prelude to BEAT UNTIL STIFF:    \\"One thing I've noticed over the years I've been selling, and now publishing mystery, is the nexus between murder and food.  What you eat or drink can kill you ...\\"    Latest news flash is that the copies of the paperback may be limited, but Amazon has a few left.  If this supply is temporarily halted, please do fork out the $$ for the hardback.  It's worth it.  Maybe it'll become a collector's item when Johnson's series grows to surge toe-to-toe with the Grafton/Davidson crowd in sales, long may they all prosper.  It's their readers who will be enriched.

They read like a true mystery with gutsy horror-implants.<br /><br />Then Angie staged in with her shining silver Mercedes, spitting through an argument with her friend, Connie, all the while dripping blood-spiced words here and there which subliminaled the reader with flashes to the rat crunching, blood-spewing, opening scene.  Oh my!<br /><br />Definitely workable as entertaining fiction, BELL, COOK and CANDLE, a paranormal/culinary with astrology in its plot, delves into the demonic, ugly side of witchcraft.  As the back flap on BC&C says, its plot has a \\"Dash of Darkness.\\"<br /><br />While the whole book was great, the second half was an absolute, relentless capture, with the plot machinations rolling well and the characters growing deeper.  How did Pence do this so adeptly, within the boundaries of a paranormal culinary?<br /><br />Possibly I should mention, though, that if a reader is craving a cozy with drool-inducing food references, and recipes woven sensually, mouth watering-ly into the plot, this title does not do a depth charge there.  The main character, Angie Amalfi, is testing an ingenious new business called COMICAL CAKES, and three recipes are included at the end of the story, but the cooking/eating process does not overwhelm 95% of the plot (to \\"fix\\" those obsessive/compulsive, nuance-lush, needy, needy taste buds).<br /><br />However, the richness of the intrigue developed from the paranormal undercurrents in this work gives more than enough sensual intrigue to provide a very successful, entertaining read, with the characters developed with a myriad of machinations to moisturize the cerebral dryness which some readers can't seem to get into in certain types of classic mystery fiction.<br /><br />The escalating plot and character development in the final quarter of the book kept me flipping pages through those times when I would have normally temporarily retired my ongoing paperback and slipped into a bout of wordless day dreaming, or picked up the RC for the TV.<br /><br />This was actually the first novel I had read in in the Amalfi series, and I had read it years ago (August 2002).  At the time, I was contrasting a collection of culinary, recipes-included authors, seeking for more, more, more FLAVOR, and disappointed if the in-plot cooking was minimal.<br /><br />Yet, as I dove into that collection, I found gems like this one, which surprised me by providing other types of reading satisfaction which worked as well or better than what I though I was craving.  Still, at that time I was a definite gourmet junkie without the ambition to do any great guns cooking in my own kitchen.<br /><br />At that time of culinary desperation, I noted:<br /><br />\\"I will definitely be tempted to read another Joanne Pence mystery with Angie Amalfi; I'll be curious to see if her other offerings include more cooking details within the plot. Are Diane Mott Davidson (with her Goldy-the-Caterer series) and Phyllis Richman (WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA HAM) the only culinary authors who actually COOK, with any regular, drawn-out, sensual detail, in their books?\\"<br /><br />I plan to reread this book, in sequence with the rest of the series, to refresh my memory on some of these details.<br /><br />In closing, I'll quote something I wrote during the time I was reading BELL, COOK, and CANDLE:<br /><br />Back in Augst of 2002, I was doing a very quick shop in Wal Mart.  Rushing by a stack of 3 pound coffee cans, I flashed on an ad which said something like \\"catch the difference.\\"<br /><br />Without a single countering thought, I grabbed the can.<br /><br />As a Libra I can pro and con any choice to death.  I did notice that the price was under $4, which is my demarcation for the \\"easily affordable in my budget\\" for that item.  I also noticed that the brand was something legitimate and established, like FOLGERS.  But mostly I noticed the phrase \\"catch the difference\\" and its uncanny connection to myrecently published editorial on the spiritual-barometer-quirkiness of the elusive flavor in coffee.<br /><br />With renewed hope in my heart, I grabbed the can and settled it securely onto the shiny-wire-mesh floor of the shopping basket.<br /><br />The next morning I made the first pot of coffee from that can, waiting to open it just before dipping the scoops. The coffee,  even in my fourth cup, was \\"nice & nutty.\\"  It didn't descend to bitter, sour, burned old weeds (like my coffee usually does after the first sip, sometimes before).  It held its flavor.  I even poured a bit of the fresh from the carafe over a remainder in the bottom of the cup, which had grown cool and been micro-waved (the flavor held!).<br /><br />Houston, we have a launch!  (Who could launch a culinary cozy without the caffine Energizer Bunny having a lucky foot in it.)<br /><br />The surprised satisfaction expressed in the above, true coffee story is how I felt about Pence's BC&C when I finished reading it, even without its being packed to the brim with juicy culinary tidbits for me to stumble over and get my fix but miss the point altogether.<br /><br />Each author has his/her own draw, and Pence has more than PLENTY!<br /><br />Salute!

Gloria, an 8 year old girl is playing Hide `n Seek with Robbie, the robot, her playmate, protector, and pondering giant ... who has a telling weakness ... a storytelling weakness.<br /><br />The one thing Robbie is not is pompous. But, he is ... a ... sensitive kind of \\"guy.\\" The relationship between Robbie and Gloria is as endearing as it is frightening.

I'll read it again.<br /><br />Each time it seems to live in my mind on a grander, higher scale.<br /><br />In interviews and in some of her nonfiction books, Rand has said that the purpose of a novel is to entertain, to tell a good story.  In ATLAS SHRUGGED she has accomplished this purpose, possibly better than any other novel.  I haven't read every other novel; I don't want to read every other novel, so I won't attempt to say or prove this with certainty.  I will say with certainty that ATLAS SHRUGGED is not a good story; it's a great story.<br /><br />Reportedly, Rand's intellectual friends were continually asking her to write her ideals into nonfiction (maybe so they could digest them better); yet her soul lived in stories painting the heroic in life.  She believed we live in a beneficent universe and that human beings were meant to achieve great joy, and to feel that joy in every moment.<br /><br />In ATLAS SHRUGGED, Rand proceeded to dramatize (not to intellectualize) her concept of why we have thoughtlessly allowed ourselves to pervert this beneficence, and how to get back on track.<br /><br />Many would say that a 50 page speech, given to the world by John Galt over secured radio waves, is more intellectualization than dramatization.  I read that clear radio voice as drama perfectly staged within a well executed plot; I saw it as well earned, actually necessitated, by the complex weaving of multiple mysteries building unequivocally to the dramatic enlightenment presented in that speech.<br /><br />The first time I read Atlas, in 1986, it took me a few months to get through it.  It had taken me years prior to that to get past the first scenes of Eddie's \\"causeless uneasiness.\\"  I would read carefully to the point of him recalling the magnificent oak tree which was rotten inside, and I'd put down the book.  Eddie's gestalt was so depressing and confusing, I couldn't push forward, couldn't go beyond this budding and painful awareness in Eddie, a seeding of consciousness which felt as if it had nowhere, no way to blossom.<br /><br />Maybe I sensed the plot would move slowly, complexly, mysteriously, dramatically ... backward ... into the darkest night of the soul of the human race, before it would be ready to lift into any type of healing light.<br /><br />It took me a while, a bit of growing, to be ready for that backwards, downward soul drop.<br /><br />Yet, when Atlas lifted the reader into Galt's Gulch, I soared.<br /><br />I soared higher than I've been taken by any work of fiction.<br /><br />Is it a great story when an author takes a reader into the bowels of human culture, into the primal, absolute absence of true thought, paints that dank sewer-of-a-world brilliantly with the deepest, richest, most frightening and heart-wrenching color and clarity, then surges the reader suddenly upward on the strongest wings available to an embodied human form?  Is that a great story, or what??<br /><br />I'm speaking beyond the airplane ride Dagney piloted to break through to a small setting where a tiny, almost toy-like railroad was a more true-to-life example of that industry than the ugly, gritty, dark world beyond Galt's location.<br /><br />When I say, simply, that there are true CHARACTERS in this book, I might have to set that statement against a contrast which would have to consider that there may be no true characters in any other novel.  But, I don't want to say that, exactly.  I merely want to exalt as it deserves, Rand's executed skill as a novelist.<br /><br />I love stories.  I love characters.  I consistently read books I'm able to unfailingly and honestly give 5 Star reviews.<br /><br />But to read ATLAS SHRUGGED is to be temporarily diminished in ability to fully enjoy other novels.  This is why I hesitate to read it again right away.  The contrast in the depth of characters, the complexity of plot and subplot machinations, the beauty of the mystery which unfolds in pacing soperfect it cannot be called pacing, it must be described as a natural, living sequence of cause and effect, all this honoring of the true form of the story, of a saga, is almost too rich to exist in the same time frame of other examples of human art.<br /><br />Even as I exalt Atlas, however, this time I will be able to return immediately to my culinary cozies and love the heck out of them.  Why?  That's for me to know and you to find out, if you're interested.<br /><br />For a placement of my customer review of ATLAS SHRUGGED on Amazon.com, I chose the cover of this novel which was taken from a painting by Ayn Rand's husband, Frank O'Conner.  He was an artist; he gave a worthy image for his wife's novel.<br /><br />I admire and appreciate every artistic version of this book, every exquisite cover presentation; the book's gestalt has the capacity to draw greatness from anyone who attempts to capture any nuance of it.  But, I wanted to honor Rand's husband's contribution to her career as a novelist, a contribution which went beyond what most of her readers would be able to imagine.  And I love O'Conner's red sun setting, his glowing, straight steel rails heading toward that day's end.  I love the deep greens and iron-rust-red of the sun ball, and more.<br /><br />I will stand, spine straight as possible with arthritis, and salute Ayn Rand and Frank O'Conner.  They lived.  They suffered.  As all of us, possibly they suffered unnecessarily, as a matter of maturing as a race, as a matter of growing in consciousness about cause and effect.

She wanted to give each of us that unique individual inside, terrified of shining, filled with shame (afraid to eat, even).

When I first picked up NANTUCKET DIET MURDERS and set in to begin reading, I felt a \\"duh\\" when suddenly noticing the significance of the word \\"diet\\" in the title.<br /><br />As I continued reading, I was drawn in by the deft (though too-close-to-home) descriptions of an arthritic, elderly man easing himself into a deep tub of steaming, soothing water.  A bit later, I was saddened by a heartbreaking situation of anorexia, and intrigued by a bad guy diet pusher being situated in a culinary cozy.  It didn't take long to realize the rich potential of poaching these simmering themes.  Thankfully, a spicy, seasoned author like Rich knows the difference between poaching and pounding.<br /><br />Pounding on political issues in fiction can bruise the flavor for me.  And, yes, I know that pounding on raw beef tenderizes it.  As sensitive as I am, I don't need tenderizing, thank you.  In the case of fiction, only a delicate touch can tastefully interpose issue investment ... or should I say, palatably?<br /><br />Virginia Rich's pen (wooden spoon?) has a delightfully delicate touch and deals with touchy themes with succulent taste.  Definitely no pounding points problems here.  Quite the contrary.<br /><br />Bear with me a minute, though, while I sidetrack to hammer a hair which I will later tenderize sagely into THE NANTUCKET DIET MURDERS.<br /><br />Sometimes I've been forced to quit reading novels of really great authors for two reasons.<br /><br />-- One is the beat-into-the-ground political agenda which dramatizes every which way that US Capitalism is the Arch Evil of \\"Humanity\\" (a humanity which is repeatedly presented as evil itself, by pseudo science raving, because it's screwing up the planet and bothering moles in holes).<br /><br />Please.  Enough of this nonsense poked and prodded into otherwise good stories!<br /><br />This currently pervasive political agenda repeatedly designs Big Business as the polluted, polluting Bad Guy.  It is a horrific twist of irony that so many novels offered by US publishing houses (many of which are owned overseas) dramatize our economic system as the ultimate evil.<br /><br />Yes, this is the system called Capitalism, which allows and encourages free-spirited give and take, ownership of private property, and the right to earn and own profit as individuals or private sectors, the system founded here by our wise forefathers who had hoped to solidify and protect a natural, healthy way for the spirit to live incarnated in a physical world.<br /><br />-- The other reason I've quit reading a few really great authors is that they push their plots with too much high level tension at a too fast pace.  It keeps me riveted, yes.  But.  I feel like I'm having a heart attack all the way through the book, and am compelled to hurry to get, not to the end of the book, but OUT of it, to the other side of it.<br /><br />Of course, what better place to bash a political-economic system than from within the minds of the people being honored and sustained, body and soul, by it?<br /><br />And what better place than inside a mind being enthralled and entertained within a world designed by an author of fiction.<br /><br />\\"Man,\\" as Ayn Rand might quip from the grave, sipping espresso in dual demitasse with Virginia Rich, \\"What a perfect program for brainwashing.\\"<br /><br />And we have been.  You'd think our economic system would already be a has been.  But, how amazing is a system which is so healthy and strong, it survives the most insidious, constant leaching and battering by the intellectuals which it serves.<br /><br />And, what better place to deal with killer diets than in a culinary cozy mystery?  In this case, it's a good thing,  highlighting the toxic parts of dieting obsessions.<br /><br />Replacing the soap box into its cubby hole and returning to the reading of this mystery, as promised above, I noticed early on that the cast of Eugenia's friends were consistently called by their first names or familiar nicknames by the story's Omniscient Observer Narrator, whereas Eugenia was habitually referred to as \\"Mrs. Potter.\\"<br /><br />I had wondered if Rich had a conscious intent in that habitual reference to \\"Mrs. Potter\\"; a somewhat sneaky ploy to set the main character's maturity, perspective, and stability a slight step above her group of Nantucket friends, \\"Les Girls.\\"<br /><br />This is an intriguing technique which gives The Omniscient Narrator a subtle presence, due to his respectful, somewhat \\"nose-in-the-air\\" view of his \\"Mrs. Potter,\\" a view which gives the impression of a butler who holds the utmost approval for his employer, and feels just a tad bit that she is lowering herself to be chummy with these other grandmothers who seem to have taken up permanent residence in adolescence.  Yet, Genia herself comes across as an egalitarian, level-nosed lady, and seems to truly see herself as \\"one of the girls.\\"<br /><br />Rich does have a different writing style than Nancy Pickard, who took on Eugenia's continuance after Rich entered the open gateway into higher realms where to write would be to literally create a new reality<br /><br />Interestingly, in each of Pickard's later two novels in this series (BLUE CORN MURDERS and SECRET INGREDIENT MURDERS), the omniscient narrator always refers to \\"Genia\\" instead of to \\"Mrs. Potter.\\"  In the transition novel between the two authors, 27 INGREDIENT CHILI CON CARNE MURDERS, Pickard followed Rich's established pattern of referring to \\"Mrs. Potter\\" (rather than to \\"Genia\\") in narration reference. I'd love to know if Pickard made this change purposely or unconsciously.<br /><br />To me it's apparent that Rich was very like her Mrs. Potter character, a woman who had grown gracefully and graciously (as well as grittily) through each day of her life, and fully earned the maturity of every year of her age.  Pickard is also an admirable woman, but a subtly different one, from a different generation.  Rich grew through the cultural time frame of strong women feeling free and feisty by rebelliously indulging in the \\"vices\\" of cigarettes and alcohol.  Pickard entered the world in a time-frame enough beyond that phase to be unable to fully portray in Genia's character the essence of having lived that era.<br /><br />While reading THE NANTUCKET DIET, my first dip into Virginia Rich's three novels, I had wanted to be especially attuned to the differences in Genia as portrayed by each of her two excellent authors.  I was surprised and intrigued.  I noticed more of differences than I had anticipated.  The variations, though, do not diminish Eugenia's appeal.  That character works beautifully through both authors.<br /><br />In this plot, through Mrs. Potters stream-of-consciousness, Rich has amazingly exposed the evolution of the cultural mind set which feeds Anorexia within the vulnerable minds of young women compelled toward health and beauty.  Rich uses a Rainbow's End scenario of the pot of gold always one more step, one less bite away from a last gasp, a clutching, clinging grasp of the hour glass.<br /><br />In human life on Earth, Time takes prisoners only for a while prior to setting them free.<br /><br />Maybe one of the purposes of the \\"imprisonment\\" of embodiment is enlightenment:<br /><br />See this?  See what you were doing?  See where it leads?  See where it ends?<br /><br />Maybe another of the purposes is experiencing the high entertainment value of TOUCH, through each of the senses, including most essentially, the sense of taste.<br /><br />Here we have an author who is literally in the final phases of divesting herself from a physical world, a world in which possibly one of the main gifts of that unique existence is the sensual pleasure of eating.  In those final phases of life in that existence, that author is exploring the essence of food and its nurturing facets to body, emotions, mind, and soul.<br /><br />It is true that compulsive overeating is likely more unsatisfying, more lacking in experiencing the true pleasures of sensuality, than under eating is.  But how sad it is to be able to eat only within severe limitations of one sort of another (usually all falling under the profane word, \\"diet\\").  How sad it is to be able to eat only with the accompanying anti-appetizers of guilt, anxiety, and downright fear, which have been culturally instilled into every bite.<br /><br />Rich has treated these issues amazingly gracefully, bringing an enlightenment to the surface, but not pounding any angle or investing feverishly in any prescription.  She has merely given nurturing food for thought without forcefully or overly limiting the parameters of possible conclusions.<br /><br />Virginia Rich was a gracious, wise lady who has successfully infused those qualities into her mystery series, especially in this unique story and character set.<br /><br />It's intensely satisfying to read a book by an author who doesn't radiate terror in every chosen word, terror that she'll be boring if her pace is pleasantly methodical; an author who doesn't overuse speed and shock as ready pills to counter artistic insecurity.

Shelnuttneration.  Rich grew through the cultural time frame of strong women feeling free and feisty by rebelliously indulging in the \\"vices\\" of cigarettes and alcohol.  Pickard entered the world in a time-frame enough beyond that phase to be unable to fully portray in Genia's character the essence of having lived that era. <br /> <br />While reading THE NANTUCKET DIET, my first dip into Virginia Rich's three novels, I had wanted to be especially attuned to the differences in Genia as portrayed by each of her two excellent authors.  I was surprised and intrigued.  I noticed more of differences than I had anticipated.  The variations, though, do not diminish Eugenia's appeal.  That character works beautifully through both authors. <br /> <br />In this plot, through Mrs. Potters stream-of-consciousness, Rich has amazingly exposed the evolution of the cultural mind set which feeds Anorexia within the vulnerable minds of young women compelled toward health and beauty.  Rich uses a Rainbow's End scenario of the pot of gold always one more step, one less bite away from a last gasp, a clutching, clinging grasp of the hour glass. <br /> <br />In human life on Earth, Time takes prisoners only for a while prior to setting them free. <br /> <br />Maybe one of the purposes of the \\"imprisonment\\" of embodiment is enlightenment: <br /> <br />See this?  See what you were doing?  See where it leads?  See where it ends? <br /> <br />Maybe another of the purposes is experiencing the high entertainment value of TOUCH, through each of the senses, including most essentially, the sense of taste. <br /> <br />Here we have an author who is literally in the final phases of divesting herself from a physical world, a world in which possibly one of the main gifts of that unique existence is the sensual pleasure of eating.  In those final phases of life in that existence, that author is exploring the essence of food and its nurturing facets to body, emotions, mind, and soul. <br /> <br />It is true thatcompulsive overeating is likely more unsatisfying, more lacking in experiencing the true pleasures of sensuality, than under eating is.  But how sad it is to be able to eat only within severe limitations of one sort of another (usually all falling under the profane word, \\"diet\\").  How sad it is to be able to eat only with the accompanying anti-appetizers of guilt, anxiety, and downright fear, which have been culturally instilled into every bite. <br /> <br />Rich has treated these issues amazingly gracefully, bringing an enlightenment to the surface, but not pounding any angle or investing feverishly in any prescription.  She has merely given nurturing food for thought without forcefully or overly limiting the parameters of possible conclusions. <br /> <br />Virginia Rich was a gracious, wise lady who has successfully infused those qualities into her mystery series, especially in this unique story and character set. <br /> <br />It's intensely satisfying to read a book by an author who doesn't radiate terror in every chosen word, terror that she'll be boring if her pace is pleasantly methodical; an author who doesn't overuse speed and shock as ready pills to counter artistic insecurity.  Of course everyone who writes to entertain probably has artistic insecurity in some quantity.  It can be used to hone an edge of true skill, or to sharpen the fluctuations of flash-and-run chaos, offering them as pablum to the foolish foibles of a youth terrified of true transformation.  <br /> <br />In my conclusion of this very special offering in the culinary crowd of the mystery genre, I'll note my preference for the eating styles listed by Rich; by doing so, I will not be spoiling the soup or giving it away: <br /> <br />In the epilogue-like wind-down of plot, after the culprit is deftly handled with a few subtle surprises, the author displays her ladies loosely discussing various types of diets which their generation has lived through.

[[VIDEOID:moIOEZKOWDI202]]As much as I've looked forward to ordering, owning, and reading this rare book, I'm happy to say that it's even better than I thought it would be. I wasn't factoring in the richness of the time frame of its conception and composition, which appears to have been the end of the 70's, moving into the bare beginning of the 80's, that satisfying time before shock and speed had stolen the essence of sensuality, when Robert B. Parker's Spenser series had established its market call with its first five or six novels, at least through [[ASIN:0440141966 THE JUDAS GOAT]] (# 5 in series with a 1978 Copyright), and maybe through [[ASIN:0440153166 LOOKING FOR RACHEL WALLACE]] (# 6 in series with a 1980 Copyright).<br /><br />Hailing from that cultural setting, this novel was not as soothingly cozy as I had anticipated from my current New Millennium reading perspective. Instead, the opening scene of this novel had a delicately noir mood, somewhat like Sidney Sheldon's novels' steps-out from The Literary Gateways.  The flap copy on the hardcover dust jacket of THE COOKING SCHOOL MURDERS referred to Nero Wolfe fans, and announced that this was the pilot to a mystery series beaconing to gourmands. This was not yet the time of the call to pull up bar stools to the kitchen counter top of the home based catering business of Diane Mott Davidson's heroine (see my Listmania of that series, and my reviews of [[ASIN:0060527323 DARK TORT (Goldy Culinary Mysteries, Book 13)]] and [[ASIN:0060527307 DOUBLE SHOT (Goldy Culinary Mysteries, Book 12)]]).<br /><br />I believe that the historic branching off from heavy moods etched in the dark sides of realism, into the breezier cozy offerings in amateur sleuth mystery series, especially those in the culinary category, may have had to do partially with relatively young female authors establishing a solid footing on the literary mystery stage, with Sue Grafton's phenomenal success with her early offerings in her Alphabet series, and with the establishment of Sisters in Crime. Actually, Sue's pilot to her series, [[ASIN:0312353812 \\"A\\" IS FOR ALIBI (The Kinsey Millhone Alphabet Mysteries)]], came out the same year as COOKING SCHOOL MURDERS, 1982. However, Grafton was probably a few decades younger than Virginia Rich.  In that 70's to 80's transition time frame, those decades of age difference and cultural background diversity mattered greatly, due to the surging initiations of humongous leaps of cultural change revolving around three massive factors.<br /><br />-- A huge shift in male/female role adaptations.<br /><br />-- A huge shift from manual/electric typewriters to the PC (personal computer) era.<br /><br />-- Earthquake cracks which began unraveling ancient tapestries of ethical perspectives and social strata frameworks.<br /><br />I feel I shouldn't take additional time here away from the novel I'm currently reviewing, to go further into these earth splitting contemplations. So, I'll exit this mine field with only a few prime picks of bombs diffused. Tread cautiously into further ruminations, if you wish.  You might cross lines of fire from active battles between the sexes about who's rescuing or not rescuing whom, and who's pulling the toughest end of the Macho rope (which you could hang yourself with if you're not careful; see my review on RB Parker's LOOKING FOR RACHEL WALLACE). You might even find yourself lost in The Matrix or The Relativity of Rules.<br /><br />If you do venture further into this cultural growth battle arena as it broke ground into literature, keep in mind a particular time factor which until recently had been concretized for at least a century, possibly even earlier, from the establishment of the printing press. That factor is the backtrack distance between copyright/publication dates, and the conception and beginning composition of a novel, a distance which has (on average) normally been from one to three years.<br /><br />Commonly, it takes a year for an author to compose and edit (through several drafts) a manuscript for a novel, though some prolific writers can rush the first draft of a novel in a few weeks (I've done that a couple times, though a couple months for a first draft has been my norm). Other more methodical, contemplative authors will take 10 years to finish a work of fiction. Once a novel is contracted by an established publishing house, the process of editing, formal copyrighting, printing, distribution and publication takes, on average, 6 months to a year.<br /><br />A glitch in that timing is how long it can take from a manuscript completion by an author, to that author's getting the novel contracted (with or without a literary agent) with a legitimate (that term, too, is evolving) publishing house. This time lag can be as short as having a contract in hand (with an advance on future royalties in the bank) prior to pen touching paper, or as long as the 40 years it took Frank Herbert to get his weighted ms (manuscript) for [[ASIN:0441013597 DUNE]] (was mesmerized by the book and the movie) contracted for publication.<br /><br />Returning to the historic significance of Virginia Rich's individual life and path, which was, as noted, well into its final chapter when she began this series, with wisdom gathered and garnered; I'll postulate that Virginia Rich may have had a sense (which was more than a hope, and possibly partly subliminal), of how far this series might go.  I wonder if she knew at the time of writing COOKING SCHOOL MURDERS that she had only a few years left to live....<br /><br />[This review will be continued in comments below, with hyper-links included to other books in the series.]<br /><br />With greatest appreciation for landmark literature,<br />Linda Shelnuttfor a novel, though some prolific writers can rush the first draft of a novel in a few weeks (I've done that a couple times, though a couple months for a first draft has been my norm).

Unexpectedly, this novel was richer and smoother than the other 5, in narrative style and in the dichotomies of small-town, trivial-tensions etched through the welcoming warmth of familiarity and intimacy.  In the pilot to the series, THE COOKING SCHOOL MURDERS, it seemed that Rich was writing with all cylinders primed and pumping.  At retirement age at the time, possibly she had harbored a long banked dream of writing this type of novel, and she was giving it all she had saved in her writer's soul through a rich lifetime.  See my review (link page).<br /><br />In BAKED BEAN SUPPER MURDERS, the second book in the series, the author's style seemed more relaxed.  She seemed to have settled her author's hat comfortably on her head, and to feel she would be allowed by her publisher and readers to take time setting the foundation of an extensive collection of characters, which were her neighbors and friends with a few newcomers to the community mixed into the brew, most of whom would become suspects.  Rich wasn't just developing depth into an intriguing group of characters to carry a \\"still waters run deep\\" plot.  She was developing various types of Character from ethical, philosophical, sociological, and psychological perspectives.  And she was \\"doing\\" an edgy Norman Rockwell portrait of small town life, this time with a slightly bitter twist (booze slurped tastefully, and socially tended), which eloquently exposed  the dynamics of greed and offensiveness which can fester within a small community, especially when wide spreads of class structures, and a variety of social attitudes attempt to mix (or not) within a small, seasonally lush geography.<br /><br />Below is a paragraph from my review of COOKING SCHOOL MURDERS, in which I noted the warmth Rich dramatized about another small town area, that of her own point of origin in Iowa:<br /><br />You might expect a more simply sophisticated version of Mrs. Pollifax, a version of that feisty, restless, elderly spy; a version which is contented to settle into her last chapters of life by leisurely honing the luxury of cooking, of nurturing the body and soul by being comfortably in and seeing the significance of The Basic Life within small-town-communities existing in various places on \\"The Route 66 Literary Continuum\\" from Sinclair Lewis's MAIN STREET to Grace Metalious's PEYTON PLACE, with Joanne Fluke's Hannah Swensen cookie jar series taking the cake for the sweetest, perkiest view of small town life (warm hearts in cold places; see my Listmania).<br /><br />THIS time many of Eugenia's friends and neighbors, with those among them who were neither, treated her like an old-lady-widow who should be done with the vital part of her life.  Poor souls.  They should have been warned.  In one scene Mrs. Potter was rendered speechless several times, by this group, and each time I smiled, knowing this cattle rancher (her other home was in Arizona), horse riding lady would eventually get her feet under her (or in the stirrups), and the cow pies would fly.  Loved that scene.  Loved how Rich had Potter work herself out of the offensive affronts.<br /><br />Since this # 2 in this sequence was my last novel in this series to read, I applied ginger to my reading recipe.  I've reviewed the other two novels, by Virginia Rich, and those by Nancy Pickard who successfully published three Mrs. Potter novels after Rich's death.  Possibly I had left this one to read last because I hadn't felt the pizzazz for THE BAKED BEAN SUPPER MURDERS title, as I had the others.  I wondered if that might have been because baked beans, though I love them, didn't hit my palate as anything special in the currently jazzed-up culinary world.  When Rich composed this one (probably during the transition from the 1970's to the 80's), especially from her secondary home setting in a lobster fishing village near Bangor Maine, brown bread and baked bean recipes were treasured and held close by the old guard cooks in the community.<br/><br />While you're drooling over the opening supper entrees and ingredients, allow yourself to read leisurely through the character setting space in the early plot.  I doubt any reader could have more trouble than I do with remembering a slew of names.  I was helped by knowing that Rich doesn't just drip them and let the water run out without containment, she continues (underwater basket?) weaving names, faces, bodies, and social styles, through each other and throughout the mystery, completing several tangy tapestries which will thoroughly incorporate not only each name mentioned, but will add the reader into the design, from his complimentary side.<br /><br />\\"Here's looking at you, kid.\\"<br /><br />This was an unusual mystery, in warm, spicy, and feisty ways.  In this one I felt the characters' grief for the loss of each murdered character.  I felt a deep disgust for some of the potential perpetrators.<br /><br />Long live the soul of a true novelist who happened to have a plethora of mystery spices with which to season ... A Great American Novel.<br /><br />Richness was achieved here, and shared well.<br /><br />Thank you, Virginia.  You've risen perfectly to your current residence and its unlimited views of many oceans.  No old lady, you.  Lady of the first water.<br /><br />Holding a crystal water-goblet in both hands, looking through prisms of multi-colored light, I see not a cozy culinary. I see a true author, Virginia Rich, and a true novel with a tangy, tasteful mystery included.<br /><br />Linda Shelnuttmunity. <br /> <br />While you're drooling over the opening supper entrees and ingredients, allow yourself to read leisurely through the character setting space in the early plot.

Loved the \\"Don't call the bomb squad; call a plumber\\" introductory chapter.  Was definitely drawn into the \\"Wish List\\" of a gourmet kitchen.  A cherry red stove?  Wow.<br /><br />If Jill Churchill's mystery series collection provides cherished, refreshing entertainment (which it does - see my Listmania & reviews), Joanne Pence's \\"cook\\" books are exquisite mainstream novels under the cover of cozy clothing.<br /><br />Pence gleefully grabs reader attention in chapter one with Angie's disaster loadstone magnetized on all angles.  The \\"... don't bother to send a bomb expert. Send a plumber\\" was a perfect opening for a promising series.<br /><br />I read those chapter ending lines to my husband as he was clutching his Ford diesel pickup to pull out from Murdock's parking lot onto a busy highway. Oops. My timing for interjections is atrocious.  He handled the dual duty of focus okay, but I was ashamed of myself when I realized I should have waited for a less precarious time..  But, I was so struck by the fun in that chapter's ending lines, I had to share it \\"right now.\\"<br /><br />That's a compliment to Pence's writing skill, and a warning to me that I STILL have to work on timing awareness (especially pausing prior to blurt). When enthusiasm gets hold of me, you'd think I was 5 instead of 57. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever learn.<br /><br />In chapter two Pence opens with a narrative setting which could cajole Joseph Conrad to leap out of the grave and compete.  In a fun contrast to the eternal perk of Angie's catastrophe-prone personality, the love of her life is introduced through a leisurely, macho Sunday afternoon as Pence's sensual syntax sets the scene:<br /><br />\\"The San Francisco Hall of justice, a massive, grey, granite structure, cold and intimidating, stood quiet without the chaos that routine police business brought during the week.\\"<br /><br />The uncannily realistic setting descriptions following the above statement indicate that Pence has been on the inside of a police precinct, to have seen so clearly the rare but real quiet moods of \\"letting the hair down\\" during the lulls between chaos of heavy crime scenes.  Outsiders wouldn't be allowed to experience this vulnerable silence in the crime fighters' den.  I've been there to know, previously married to a Deputy Sheriff of Multnomah County Oregon, and employed as a crime prevention officer with both that Sheriff's office and the City of Portland.<br /><br />Pence's portrayal of Inspector Pavo Smith is more realistic than any other human side of a police presence which I'm able to recall at the moment, with the possible exception of Serpico.<br /><br />Then you have Angie's \\"mouthy-ness\\" as Pavo terms it, which is hilarious.  It's amazing how Pence can slip such giggle-inducing humor (even guys would have to chuckle) within true drama without having it slip headlong into comedy.  Angie.  Is.  Funny.  Period.  She has dialogue wit without wan.<br /><br />The slip into this novel was so seamless I didn't have time or inclination to analyze (past the first couple chapters) what was drawing me in.  I was just there, though I did periodically surface to notice the awesome talent of a true novelist at work behind the scenes.<br /><br />The entertaining weaving between the spontaneity of Angie and the sensual precision, pausing thoughtfulness, and holding-back hesitance of Paavo continued throughout the novel, with realistic emotional dances and endearing relationship machinations tossed helter-skelter into plenty of action, mayhem, and candor.<br /><br />Angie possesses a repeating character \\"flaw\\" which is spicy and fun, as well as scarey for those who come to care about her.  She pauses, rests, and plays a bit within any protective prison she's been contained within.  She rambles around the cage, dutifully and sensibly.  Then a spark from the ozone (or from somewhere over the rainbow?) surfaces and she leaps into crazy, chaotic situations most of us would maybe consider cautiously in a conquering hero day dream, but wouldn't have (wouldn't WANT) the chutzpah to ever, ever act upon.  Yet, that makes Angie a perfect fictional heroine, instead of an every day person dancing with drudgeries outside the pages of a book.<br /><br />Being an every-day person is my job (when I'm escaping into fiction instead of writing it).  That's why I was able to relish Angie's surging leaps, even as I cringed and skidded on the breaks of the ottoman upon which my feet were resting, with an afghan covering them cozily.<br /><br />I'm still not certain if Pence's Amalfi series is a cozy culinary, a crime novel, a romance, or a mainstream offering.  Honestly, I don't care about its precise category; I care that I have 10 more novels in that series to read.  Yum!<br /><br />I love the colorful gingham checks on the gorgeously graphic-ed covers of the early books in the series, yet I also appreciate how the cover art progresses into artistic styles attempting to capture the exact essence of Angie, as she wrestles with Paavo and her exuberant Italian family, who could be called caricatures if they weren't so lively and real.<br /><br />Wonderful job, Pence, of following the dictates of your soul, and evolving a fantastic series of novels.<br /><br />I'm more than ready for TOO MANY COOKS, but I'm committed to pause a short while, and make a couple dents in my waiting collection of unread and unreviewed books.

Off to Market I Go, Oz Bewitched & Ozone Baited	Reading this book leisurely, at home in my easy chair ...<br /><br />(I received my copy of the hardback 12/27/05 in my rural mail box from Amazon's entertainingly addictive \\"click-n-shop\\" free-ship carnival of convenience.)<br /><br />... gave me a different impression than reading it in spits and spurts, loitering against bookshelves at  City-Market and Wal Mart during a series of grocery shopping sprees.<br /><br />What stood out in the leisurely read at home was the vivid reality in the settings, the sports bar TV scene in NYC, Lexi's library made out of a two-story old house, the local caf&eacute;, homes of characters, and small town base, including, of course, the old, seedy cemetery.  In the stand up read I was focused on the plot rhythm, which seemed much faster than in the lamplit-living-room, luxury read.<br /><br />Either way, TRUE BELIEVER feels even more special than my early intimations of it led me to believe.<br /><br />Okay.  So, what's so special about this novel?<br /><br />It breathes.<br /><br />Strutting in spontaneous steps over a paper page stage, it lives.<br /><br />As the last page lifted from fingertips, the settings in the novel did not begin fading into the archives of memory.  Somehow they remained lit, like the glow of morning twilight as the sun edges slowly above the Eastern land-line, or like a never-ending sunset spreading golden mists over the edges of scenes, like a dollhouse or a small town diorama highlighted for future use.<br /><br />Does TRUE BELIEVER descend the reader to the absolute bottom of an emotional well, and keep him there, deep enough and long enough that a catharsis blossoms peacefully from an artistically sensual depression?  It doesn't wander through exactly that type of soulful solitude of deep dark spaces of the healing heart that A BEND IN THE ROAD does.  But TRUE BELIEVER has its own special magic.  I believe it.<br /><br />It appears, based on reading many and varied reviews of TRUE BELIEVER (before and after reading the book), and after reading A BEND IN THE ROAD (see my review), that Nicholas Sparks's novels (other than TB) give an amazingly effective type of emotional therapy which descends deeper and cleaner than most types of psychological analysis can hope to accomplish.  I see why a reader could come to compulsively anticipate that catharsis, and be disgruntled when it has been replaced by another type of reading pleasure, which, to me, is equal.  But, of course, if accounts are to be measured, I'm 58 hellacious-years-old, so maybe that explains it.<br /><br />What is that equal pleasure?<br /><br />It's hard to describe, even for a girl with be-ribbon-ed pigtails hiding inside the broken down body of a wise old crone wearing a black-cone-hat, bent at the tip.  But, it seems as if Lexi and Jeremy are older souls than Sarah and Miles.  It seems that the relationships in TB have, almost imperceptibly, matured and mellowed compared to earlier Sparks novels.  The character connections in earlier novels seem younger and fresher, more emotionally volatile (to me that's not \\"for better or for worse\\"; it's just different).<br /><br />I believe that if a reader isn't craving something he has been led to believe (and hope) a book will give him, maybe he won't be disappointed to receive a different, equally satisfying gift.  Gifts are difficult, though.  Even if a person's expecting a certain thing, and is given something he didn't expect, even if it's better or as good, it might take a while to see that the change is what he had come to need and didn't know it yet.<br /><br />(See my reviews of a few culinary cozy series where I sheepishly admit to only gradually becoming able to enjoy mysteries in which characters not only do not \\"sink teeth into the warm, steamy sponge of a freshly-baked slice-of-bread\\" they don't EVEN mention \\"taking a bite of bread\\" while discussing clues.

The focus of that seminar was a fascinating analysis of the style dichotomy of British Vs American detective fiction. (a dichotomy which was enthralling to me, open-mouthed student).<br /><br />To summarize that professor's points:<br /><br />On the other side of the pond (please excuse this stereotype; it's used to spotlight a style contrast):<br /><br />- The UK domain of the Hercule Poirots and Lord Peter Wimseys, featuring the lifted-pinky-on-the-china-tea cup, is delightfully cerebrally challenging.  The inspector cajoles his reading participants with the brilliance of rambling-reasoning-romps.  If the \\"Sherlock\\" is sagacious, his setting is scrumptious: \\"Entre-vu and be pampered in a mansion.\\"  This style might initiate the plot with a castle caretaker managing an extensive staff of butlers, maids, and chatelaines, each bowing and bolting to cater to every imagined slight of luxuries lost.  Slumber is sensual (even if unsafe) atop feather ticks and down-puffy pillows.<br /><br />On this side of the pond (again, please excuse this stereotype; it's used to emphasize a contrast in genre content):<br /><br />- The US Domain of the Mike Hammers and Lew Archers, featuring the broken-nose and sliced-off-finger, is physically brutal.  The detective rivets his readers with chillingly raw, tangy-testosterone-tangents.  If the P.I. is gritty, his setting is grimy: \\"Come-hither and slum it.\\"  This style might open into an unheralded urban mood of a classic, sleazy-motel-room, set into sad surrealism by the blinking of a red-neon-light staged outside an oil-coated, cracked window lifted half-way to invite dreams of momentary night breezes which effortlessly evaporate the sweat of fitful slumber<br /><br />In either venue, murder is most dreadful, and justice is sought.  With precision, ambition, and thought.<br /><br />Primed with reminiscence of this ambiance awareness, I approached AT BERTRAM'S HOTEL.  Prior to arriving at the doorman's attention, I perused my reading history...<br /><br />To be honest, I'd been side-stepping full-blown studies of long-established, hard core mystery writers.  Unashamedly, I read fiction for personal enjoyment (I did not apply for that Master's degree, even after finishing the required class work with colors flying).  I need to slip into a sensual setting, or I can't escape  into the book's world enough to avoid the early yawn, the closing of a book's covers, the final tuck-under-chin of bed clothes ... as eyelids weigh down ... and the cerebrum closes shop.<br /><br />Then, one fine sunny day, Sue Grafton's Alphabet series gatecrashed me into the genre for keeps.  ALIBI took me for a ride beyond the college classroom, into the exquisite realm of escape fiction.  After reading Grafton's series, I didn't want to wait a year for more.  Yet, I still wasn't attracted to macho bats and bruises, or the cerebral-cereals sans creme.<br /><br />Diane Mott Davidson's yummy Goldy repeatedly cooked up, just for Marla and me, the creme de la creme, which I devoured.  Of course I wanted more, and didn't want to wait a year for the next catering campaign.  From Davidson's appetizers, I gate-cashed into the collections of cozy culinaries, and contentedly set up housekeeping.<br /><br />Burping escape-reading-satiation, I wondered if I might return to some of the established mystery masters, give them another chance to capture my cozy.<br /><br />AT BERTRAM'S seemed to offer a classy HOTEL ambiance (kicked up several notches).  I could live there, I thought, hoping Christie had slipped in enough sensual detail of the hotel lobby to shove me over the threshold of my resistance to drought.  Satisfied with every nuance as the first few pages leisurely fed word pictures, I checked into Bertram's, and eased into the London high life through full-blown-characters, wallowed in that world, plodded pleasantly through subplots.<br /><br />All that for the price of paperback.  I was, am, and will be forever impressed.<br /><br />Like Miss Marple, without a means beyond my pocketbook, I'd never have been able to pay the price of a closet-under-the stairs at this swanky ritz.  As Marple's niece and nephew gifted her to a room for a \\"week or two,\\" I laid my dollop of dollars onto a bookstore counter, and walked off with The Milky Way waiting under fingertips.<br /><br />The opening paragraphs described the \\"way\\" to Bertram's so well, the prose could be excerpted and placed into a framed example of how to lead a reader down-a-garden-path of delicious detection.  Why did I think Agatha was ... though fitting my pansy taste buds by avoiding broken noses, and not featuring characters walking gingerly with constantly cracked ribs ... why had I believed Agatha was, in a word, too dry to escape into and stick therein?<br /><br />Maybe the reading part of my cerebrum hadn't matured enough yet?  Maybe my lack of short term memory, aggravated by dyslexia, made me dread the impossible task of memorizing every clue?  Or was it just a change of attitude to read-to-enjoy, to be-taken-for-a-ride, rather than working too hard to stay in the driver's seat, alert and focused, with nemonic-devices pasted to the dash?<br /><br />Whatever it was. Something worked, and a reading worm hole appeared.<br /><br />The classic car on the cover (of a 1992 Harper paperback edition) of AT BERTRAM'S HOTEL opened it's door, and I stepped right in, breathing the aroma, feeling the smooth, cozy-crack of leather seats polished to prime.<br /><br />Agatha had her way with characters, plot, and setting.  The setting wasn't simply something to get my senses rolling in a Rolls.  It was intricately designed into a complex web with every angle and tangle interconnected in near religious fervor.  The ingredients of storytelling were so ... precisely intertwined ... so perfectly woven.  I had to conclude that my tastes had matured into picking up skiffs of subtleties and rolling them on my tongue. Though apparently dormant, they had been there all along.<br /><br />Two of the main captivating points in this novel were the hotel becoming a functioning world, and the culprit(s) stepping into such living, breathing, complex characterization as to be not only \\"comprehended,\\" but, in a sense ... admired ... even as the evil was exposed.  This type of clear creation of the villain mystique; this fathomless dark in a living labyrinth, is rarely executed with such glamour.  This level of complexity is rare even for heroes in detective fiction.<br /><br />Most often the dangerous ones are painted through a glass darkly; we might feel pity for them through a haze of disgust, as directed by the author, but we do NOT like them nor identify with them.  Yes, we have the arch-evil personifications of Sherlock's Moriarti and Stout's Zeck.  But these, rich and full-bodied though they become, are archetypes.<br /><br />The culprits at Bertram's could literally walk off the page.<br /><br />A third major point of captivation was the way Miss Marple worked with Chief Inspector Davy, so behind the scenes, yet so brilliant with simple insights, which he endearingly, intuitively respected.  The somewhat limited, though balsamic, direct exchanges between Marple and Davy were delicious, especially the final conversation as they sagely nodded heads, ensconced (innocently of course) in a suite at Bertram's.<br /><br />I'll happily return to The Master of Mystery, with sensual side trips to the Gurus of \\"picnic\\" plots, absorbing nutrients to keep me primed to \\"see the light,\\" to spot each vigil on the path leading away from perdition.<br /><br />Foryour legacy, Agatha, I stand and applaud, (with tears of honest admiration in check).

A subtle metaphysical aura, similar to Louis Lamour's HAUNTED MESA, permeates the book with a promise to reveal ravens, rain, and secrets of grain.  The plot opens with the feel of stories told of long ago and far away, even though the tall grass pasture on Eugenia Potter's Arizona cattle ranch shows simple, sunny serendipity rather than darkening storms or warring winds.<br /><br />A comical contrast in the private thoughts of Eugenia and her 70-yr-old, manly neighboring rancher warmed my face into a knowing smile.  This poor man didn't have a clue.  Between-the-lines of her passing thoughts, Genia was aware of this assumption gap, but she was becoming increasingly mesmerized by an archeological discovery.  Gracious considerations about helping the poor devil onto her page slipped into the ozone of intriguing antiquities.<br /><br />To the backdrop of her rancher neighbor scratching his head, yet convinced he knew how to handle cows and women, Genia surged forward into a rash of preparation for a journey to Cortez, Colorado, sensing she would be opening a spiritual door into an unknown but exciting world.  I applauded Genia as she quickly discounted concerns about realistic age limitations interfering with her ability to step up to this potentially daunting exercise.  As a rancher lady who regularly hefts herself on and off horses to survey her domain, her bones may creak but they accomplish their purpose well enough when turbo-charged by a willful desire to live with grit and adventure.<br /><br />The plot weaves insidiously through a physically demanding program at The Medicine Wheel Archeological camp in Cortez, building convoluted layers of intrigue laced with metaphysical machinations, from the prickly floor of the prairie to surreal levels of Anasazi lore.  Given contrasting styles and backgrounds, women of various types and ages bait each other; and a male camp organizer, coexisting comfortably with females, adds spice to the relationship drama as multiple mysteries are set, matched, and checkmated.  Maybe this game-board complexity should be no surprise.  An ear of corn, icon of elemental magic, does look somewhat like Nature's chessboard.<br /><br />The final chapter comes full circle, as fiction does when entering the realm of art.  As chapter 37 opens, it seems to be leading Genia into a righteous build-up of rage and rancor; the volcanic tension is aimed toward her bull-headed neighbor, the clueless male who stood beside her in the pasture as the novel opened on page one.  Then, surprise!  The last 3 sentences stage a perfectly-prosed-release, rare and uncanny in it's quantum-quick, cathartic delight.<br /><br />BLUE CORN is an engrossing, bewitching read, enriched from the perspective of a seasoned, well-aged female character of wit, wisdom, and wherewithal.<br /><br />Now that I've written comments on the 3 novels which extended Eugenia Potter's character into Nancy Pickard's authorship, I'll be ready to begin (after addressing piles of other novels recently read) my anticipated drift back in time, into Eugenia's world as it was developed by her creator, Virginia Rich.<br /><br />After reading the easily available Eugenia Potter offerings by Pickard, I had planned to unearth a copy of the pilot of this series, THE COOKING SCHOOL MURDERS.  But, on checking Amazon's stock, I was pleasantly surprised to see that THE NANTUCKET DIET MURDERS was on a \\"Super Saver No Shipping Special,\\" so I ordered that book (along with 3 additional culinary cozies by other favorite authors).

The pivotal character for the story, this spicy, elderly man grows rapidly in the reader's mind.  He alternates between the fading sunlight of Genia's view of him, and the spotlights on shadows he has forced into the opinions of others, as various characters expose facets of this archetypal paragon of, is it elemental evil or situational good ...<br /><br />Cross generational perspectives are drawn with amazing realism here, especially as exposed in the relationships between Jason, a teenage male, and Parker; and in the same complex kid's exchanges with Genia (his aunt), parents, friends, towns people.  In fact this plot has a fairly large collection of characters with multiple-unique-relationships; each connection has fluid depth, with bonus intrigue in unanticipated, fluky foibles.<br /><br />Nancy Pickard seems to have the knack which Virginia Rich had and instilled into Genia, of exposing the flickering nuances between the bright spots and dark alleys in any persona.  I continued wondering, throughout the novel, \\"Is this a good or bad guy?  If he's a bad guy, he's not too far off the edge of redemption.\\"<br /><br />In this uncanny awareness of the fluctuating shift of good and evil, Pickard fertilizes another of the captivating qualities of Genia, a generous wisdom, which Pickard has weeded and pruned around Virginia Rich's rooted and sprouted character seeds.  It's intriguing indeed to observe close up the fleshing out by a younger female author a character and setting initiated by an older female author who has passed on, through her own death, a fictional character strong enough to be worthy of continuance.<br /><br />A theme of this type of character continuance seems to be rooting and flourishing beyond Eugenia Potter, considering the current situations of Archy McNally, and Nero Wolfe, at least.  Isn't it interesting that each of these diehard, fictional characters has been inspired, allowed, even encouraged, to jazz up their plots by wallowing in the sensual ambiance of culinary persuasions?<br /><br />Is food in a novel akin to food for the soul; does this nurturing on paper feed a fictional persona well enough to survive, develop, and sell long past his creator's passage?<br /><br />Does this budding concept (now flowering and fruiting) somehow expose the secret ingredient for cooking up the creme of the gourmet in fiction, handing readers a silver platter of solved mysteries of life and death?  Fresh fruit and creme, with a few edible flower blossoms tanging the \\"soup\\"; that would be one of my favorite desserts.<br /><br />Returning to the reality of reading, I'll report that in Nancy Pickard's SECRET INGREDIENT MURDERS' the fast paced build up to denouement was intensely satisfying and insightful (especially for an old lady romping realistically to the rescue, then being caught dead-handed, then delayed into an unwelcome exchange with the culprit).  The conclusion and wind down were inspiring as well.<br /><br />Read it and reek of delicate-snow-fall drifting on peach blossoms.<br /><br />Read it and reap the essence of springtime cracking the chrysalis of winter.<br /><br />Writing with a contented, Chess-Cat-grin, gardening a ten-ton Wish List at Amazon.com, possibly knowing something you don't, but soon will,<br /><br />Linda G.

US	14242930	R3NZTO1OYX3XOL	0061031224	400934481	Love for Sale (Grace & Favor Mysteries, No. 4)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Radio Static Backdrops Tinny voice, "This Is The Operator."	Oh my.  Another one of those yummy covers which makes me want to leap into its picture and soak up the art.<br /><br />The luxurious color-combo is literally healing in its delicious hue-intensity with primal-contrast; the design paints an addictive, nouveau-uplift on historic mysteries; the tangy texture of raised print nudges fingers to slide over the face; the extra flap-under-cover is welcoming, exposing the publisher's commitment to the book's value.  Love the way the crescent moon leads the eye to the yellow light in an upstairs window on the brick mansion, then to the flapping pink curtain.  Love how these image icons are repeated from the external scenes into the upstairs bathroom as itchy fingers open the flap.  Drool.  Slurp.<br /><br />Churchill's confidence gracefully shows itself as the plot rhythm and character development eases off to a tattoo of Lilly, John, and support cast unhurriedly discussing life and politics.  The story doesn't need to surge into a mystery mode until around page 37 of the paperback, when the murder is up.  The event is staged with panache, and the characters hop to; shifting effortlessly into a hot-step jazz.  I didn't quite notice I had been taken for a ride; but, of course, that's what I was there for.<br /><br />The mystery kicks in, a la Agatha Christie; it's easy to see why Churchill's been compared to Miss Christie, even said to have surpassed the Master.<br /><br />The story hums along smoothly in a snappy beat; so much so  that, once the story ends, the reader is left with the stillness of true silence.  The feeling is like that of a refrigerator compressor, humming as un-noticed \\"white noise\\" in the background.  Once the motor stops, however, a warm body having been resting in the soothing, active presence is abruptly transported from what he had adjusted to as an ongoing reality in a cozily buzzing cocoon, into the empty exaggeration of the chill of motionless existence.<br /><br />Sometimes that cessation of refrigerator-type-buzz is felt as relief.<br /><br />Other times it is felt as a loss carrying a nearly overwhelming sense of grief.<br /><br />When the hum of the mystery-in-process in LOVE FOR SALE culminates at the final period on the last page, there's a feeling of \\"Oh no, don't end, not yet.\\"<br /><br />This is the call of the cozy mystery sub-genre, a call which is heard and answered, in this novel especially.<br /><br />Maybe it's the live-in quality of this sub-genre which somehow gives it the right (or the necessity) to continue, in ongoing, addictive series.  Though the act of murder is as far from cozy as a warm body can get, maybe the desire for it's resolution and ultimate cessation is nurtured within that culture of comfort.<br /><br />If that desire grows strong enough, might triumph and redemption win in our species?<br /><br />See what type of contemplation Churchill's \\"simple\\" cozy, LOVE FOR SALE, can elicit from the soul of a reader who loves a good mystery resolved well?<br /><br />Not wanting to conclude before mentioning some of the unique pulls of this story, I'll note that Chief Walker, the investigator, does not typically fade into the background as the amateur sleuth does the real work of exposing the dirt.  Walker is an unusually warm, hired servant of justice, who methodically, yet compassionately walks determinedly, unwaveringly through his job.  He's like a Columbo without the build up of bungle.  In a typical Churchill character draw, Chief Walker is easy to be with, non-assuming, not a tough guy, just endearingly responsible in a step-by-step sort of way.  He serves people simultaneously to serving justice.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the hits here and there of the historic setting, when radio knobs are tuned for updates on \\"what's going on,\\" instead of Remote Controls aimed and fired; when rarely made, heavily assisted by the Operator, long-distance phone calls are required, instead of flip-open cell phones lifted from humongous purses.Then there's the political pull of presidents elected, with the plot opening and closing as characters discuss and deal with Roosevelt in process of taking the gantlet from Truman.<br /><br />Jill Churchill must have a worm hole or time machine somewhere in her closet, to be able to successfully work two mystery series, which are ages and universes apart in culture and style.  I hope she never allows any discouragement lurking \\"In The Still of The Night\\" to break down the reality between her creativity and its deserved manifestation.<br /><br />Well done, lady!<br />Linda G.

Usually I know why a book keeps me reading; I know exactly what the capture cons are.  In the case of  McNALLY's PUZZLE, I kept reading with my own puzzle to saw with a jig.  It had something to do with a jazzy writing rhythm and with the tightly focused, First-person-Narrative pushing Archy's socially elite slang.<br /><br />I found myself wondering where I'd left my dictionary; didn't want to lose the frequent opportunities to learn new words.  Yet, I realized that some of the expressions Archy chewed and spewed with polished abandon were not only beyond my repertoire, they wouldn't be found in a published \\"literary academy\\" of American English.  Whom does one approach for information on colloquialisms and slang which slip-slides around in socially superior swamps causing nose-in-the air neck kinks?<br /><br />The book continued to draw me in, in spite of the mild irritation at Archy's dynamically driven dialogue and sensual soliloquy, doused with words I somewhat grasped in context, phrases which nudged me forward as I felt I should stop reading to research, and really digest every nuance of prose ... maybe that's part of the draw.  Sanders does have a knack for creating a cajoling rhythm which carries me along, whispering to let go of whiffs of undone details as I fancy forward, wondering what Archy will say and do next.<br /><br />I'm in Archy's mind, even if it is a dramatic dichotomy to my own sloppy thoughts.  Archy, even if his speaking patterns irritate me, is feisty-foot-dragging fun to be with.<br /><br />McNALLY'S PUZZLE is my first taste of this Lawrence Sanders series.  I was initially brought to it by readers' complaints about Archy's obsession with food, and Lawrence's including every tasty bite in the plot.  In fiction I seek stimulation of the senses, though most often my moods prefer to go beyond and before the abundantly available ploys of the shock syndrome, and gregariously graphic sex.  What else is there but solitary, tongue-in-teeth tangos with the manna of the gods? Well, yeah, there are mountains and streams, street lamps and bed springs ... these are a few of my favorite things ... huh?<br /><br />For me, the statement, \\"Archy bites off a big piece of bread,\\" might work up a hint of saliva.  That's what I usually get in a work of food fiction, when I'm lucky.  But, the descriptive luxury of, \\"His teeth sink into the delicate texture of a soft, yeasty, French baguette, edged by the crunch of a crusty cover,\\" could get a stomach growl out of a full balloon.  That's how I write the description of taking a bite of bread.  I could use much more of that brand of sensual prose in my escape fiction (in my reading of it, that is; my writing's usually saturated with appeals to the senses).  Yet, I'm not puzzled about the natural tendency of some readers to have their tongues in their toes (shoes), wanting to go get ON with the fancy footwork.<br /><br />It is the rhythm of the syntax, though; it is.  And the tight focus on Archy.  That is what kept me reading long enough to get beyond my minimal irritation at the pondering push of the word dance.<br /><br />Once the rhythm had me going, and going, and picking up the book each time I had the time to read, I began being led by the nose, as well as the tongue, into the mystery developing with the precise timing of a master at a modern dance studio.<br /><br />Then the pace picked up slightly, plateau-ed, picked up a little more, and so on, to a perfect conclusion.  That's all I'll say about that, not wanting to sing the secrets, or sling them around.<br /><br />Sanders exposed true confidence as an author in the pacing pauses of Archy's daily routines in this novel and especially in the succinct, crisp style of the picked up dance of denouement.  I laughed out loud in cheering glee several times during the final five chapters.  Archy's father's heated question to a brouhaha which brought him out of his night sanctuary was classic, heart-healing humor.<br /><br/>Okay.  I see why Archy lives on and on, even though Sanders now has wings and flies with exotic birds of paradise, bless his heart and soul.<br /><br />Still have another puzzle, though.

Lifting spectacles up on my nose, I noticed that the decor at my booth included a large, fashionably-framed print of a parrot, a twin to the one on my book jacket.  In fact, the restaurant was plush with parrot paraphernalia, parroting the swampy mystique of Palm Beach, sister to New Orleans in oozing mysterious muchies.  Was this an omen of some sort?  A message from the miasma of muses meandering off Florida's Gold Coast? Splash!<br /><br />Okay.  No puzzle.  Synchronicity.

And, I like your subtle development of Archy, all the way through the book, especially the warm, simple, real way you enhanced the exchanges between Archy and his new Terrier, Hobo.

(without shame)	Phyllis Richman's Chas Wheatley comes into her own in MURDER ON THE GRAVY TRAIN.<br /><br />Her \\"own\\" is one of the best dramatizations of the ferociously functional female who's been developed every-which-way in every genre, from historic romances to futuristic female cops side-genres (Nora Robert's JD Robb series).  This type (not tin) is female in the vulnerable, sensitive, insecure, even \\"needy\\" sense; but she always, always, always gets the job done, and often struts across a screen or pounds over paper pages in a honed Macho Act, oiled, skinny muscles gleaming out of cut-off sleeves of a skin-tight-tank-top.<br /><br />Wheatley wears this character balance of vulnerability/visceral-ability with a \\"va va voom\\" of perfection; add the bonus of Chas teetering on the edge of 50 with a voluptuous body (frumpy when mood's sour) which is ages beyond Twiggy in garnering appeal.<br /><br />In all 3 of Phyllis Richman's novels Chas personifies perfection of this female blend of strength toned with uncovered insecurity (if I wanted to be politically correct I'd religiously replace the word \\"insecurity\\" with \\"vulnerability\\" or \\"emotionally spirited\\").  Yet, possibly what makes Gravy Train the epitome in this development is that Chas is dealing with in-her-face detail with a separation from the love of her life, fellow journalist, the sexy-sensitive-macho Dave.  Her emotional machinations are well done; I was successfully strung along throughout the plot, wondering how this situation will be resolved.<br /><br />Okay, spit it out, Linda:<br /><br />In being the \\"T\\" of this luscious female dichotomy, Chas is the best example of what most authors push to personify in the concept of human heroine.<br /><br />Yes Ma'am, in Gravy Train Chas shows up in delightfully frumpy fun as this # 1 Characterization of \\"I AM Woman; hear me CHEW.\\"<br /><br />Love the way Chas deals with her insecurity, facing it, wallowing in it with a gleeful (and sometimes grumpy) grace.  A reader could begin a nose-wrinkle, wondering if this lady's an incompetent basket case, then Chas steps forward into the part of her life she's been fretting over, and lives, moves, maneuvers, meanders with a sure-fire aim toward her goals, without cheating with the cover of an act. For me, this type of self-honesty, this flawless flaunting of foibles is an endearing capture.<br /><br />One of the best dramatizations of this personality gestalt in Gravy Train is Chas's unlikely but realistically, sensitively drawn, short and steamy relationship with a Lebanese Taxi driver with exquisite taste and background.  Of course, this intriguing interjection was made possible by Chas and Dave's \\"maybe we should cool off a bit and see what happens.\\"  The book is worth purchasing, reading, and retaining in a place of honor for this Taxi romance, side-trip alone.  The character exchange is so well drawn I swear it must have happened in every nuance ... somewhere.<br /><br />First, character development makes this book a must-have, winning-piece-of-literature.  Then, the wealth of sensual information about the restaurant industry adds to an already awesome value.  Richman describes with such mouth-watering detail her dining experiences pursuant to her columns, I feel I've been there and tasted every bite, without having to fork over hundreds of dollars per entre, not to mention the wine, bottled water, and dessert additions.  I feel like a thief having picked up this book for the mere price of a paperback.<br /><br />If Phyllis Richman doesn't write many, many more novels in this series (of course I've read all three and plan to reread them), I swear Chas Wheatley will walk off the pages of these books and slam Phyllis into a wall of file cabinets at the Washington Post office complex, demanding a continuance of her life.<br /><br />PLEASE, Ms. Richman, don't let the life leach out of Chas Wheately because she was created by an author with so much talent she spreads herself too thin in too manytangents.  That may be a worse crime than murder!<br /><br />Just kidding, yet, this series is almost TOO good to be true, which makes me fear for its demise, yet cross fingers to see a sign somewhere of an upcoming novel.<br /><br />I'm craving to DINE again a la deja vu, Phyllis!  Chas is the only gateway there.  Reading restaurant reviews just isn't the same.<br /><br />If I had an E-mail address for Richman, I'd invite her to read this rave, hoping it would give her a turbo-boost into the next Chas novel, or am I overestimating the power of honest, well deserved praise?<br /><br />Chanting to the Culinary Gods,<br />Linda G.

US	14242930	R2YWH0C92I73AJ	0060502916	934764941	Courting Disaster: An Angie Amalfi Mystery	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Burgundy Complexity; A Fine Red Wine With Surefire Finish	Joanne Pence's Angie Amalfi continues delighting this reader with variations on plugging in her talent as a trained (trapped?) gourmet chef, and through humorously portrayed angst on this-and-that, especially around her mother's interjections of suggested direction.<br /><br />In COURTING DISASTER Angie frets over an engagement party Serefina (her mother) is planning in high profile secrecy.  Angie is consumed with desperation to discover the diddly details of her mother's choices of color schemes, etc., related to this upcoming party.<br /><br />I was absolutely taken by surprise and overwhelmingly impressed with the way Angie's well-fed angst over the perfection of her party's ambiance, carried on entertainingly throughout the novel, was concluded in the denouement.  Do check out how everyone's Dressed To The Nines?  But, from which base number system are they making their debuts?  That is the question.  Or, one of the many which are answered absolutely.<br /><br />From the first page to the last, this mystery was more sophisticated that most offerings in this genre.  The burgundy complexity sneaks up on a reader who's been fooled into feeling he's in the book only for the exquisitely executed \\"let's party\\" escapism.  All within the justification of escorting a villain to his or her payment of karma, of course.<br /><br />The opening of the novel does a moody-blues, literarily stylish, sensitive step-in as Angie's seemingly superficial friend, Stanfield Bonnette, drags his psyche through a self-pity soliloquy, moaning with such gregarious gusto that temptations of Prozac would be magnetically repelled before they could find an ozone hole for access to mental persuasion.  After a few pages of this, Stan has taken the reader into a submarine dive into the murky depths of his unusual character; there's more to him than even he would admit.<br /><br />The Classic opening scene of antique detective fiction describes with sensual sleaze the quintessential dumpy motel room's open window on a red-neon-light blinking to a slow-two-step, keeping rhythm with the hero's nearly dead heart ... beat.  The essence (sans motel room ambiance) of that type of urban-fringe, jazzed-up-depression, turning downtrodden into a sought-after art form, is captured in Stan's sensitive soliloquy.  Thumbs up for a great Act One, Scene One, Pence!<br /><br />And kiss my joined finger tips in salute for the performances of the generous collection of characters reeking in \\"Perfecto\\" personality quirks, and the read-aloud-and-share dialogue dances.  Of course the women in the plot are delightfully or dingily feisty and varied in temperament, depth, and essence; but the coup beyond coups in this novel is that every male in the plot is an unusually rich, complex example of that gender of the species. Each is potently, yummy male, yet uniquely one-of-a-kind.<br /><br />The contrast of enlightened-macho-styles between Angie's fiancee, Paavo, and her father is especially well done.  I was absolutely entertained by every word, gesture, and action exchanged between those two as they bungled from antipasto antipathy into side-glancing, no-admitting-it thoughts of, \\"maybe-I'm-gonna-like-you-after-all ... or ... then-again-maybe-not\\" intimacy.<br /><br />There are too many sub-intrigues and character sets to begin to describe the multiplicity of duplicities woven into one of the tightest, densest, most luxurious carpets of Persian (Excuse, Italian) perfection to be found metaphor-ed into fiction.<br /><br />- There's Stan and his truly varied (and insightful) relationships with several women, including Angie, and none of these connections come close to superficiality, except maybe the wise avoidance of \\"tap-dancing\\" with Nora.<br /><br />- There's the sensitively and realistically explored social issue of baby's born, sold, or delivered to unworthy or incapable parents, contrasted to a fresh look at true parenting, out-of-the-box but in the ball park of \\"Yes, that'll work,\\" providing the contented conclusion, \\"This child's lucky.\\"<br /><br />- There are issues of intimacy, approach/avoidance complexes therein, along with \\"how-to\\"s on getting there between friends of either gender combos, between parents and children, between heterosexual partners, among every-which-way of one-on-one dances through life.<br /><br />How does Pence deliver this amount of intrigue and intensity through a legitimate mystery, filling in the blanks of that genre, yet using it as a cover for a literary mainstream novel?<br /><br />She does it with the pizzaz of light, fun humor and the panache of a visceral awareness of how spirited people get \\"up close and personal\\"; how they relate and grow satisfyingly close, simultaneous to working the kinks out of life's hard-lines and hardships.<br /><br />Well done, Pence!!

Jane and Shelley had skeptically agreed to join a couple hardcore feminists to discuss participation in a construction venture.  As the women try to lure Jane & Shelley into their mad project of remodeling and decorating a dilapidated mansion, the reader's taste buds are bated by Jane's descriptions of luncheon plate contents towering toward culinary pinnacles.<br /><br />Churchill has an uncanny ability to write with such a flowing, lighthearted ease that her plots and characters (even when shrouded in the miasma of moodiness) skip along merrily, just two suburban housewives dining casually around danger, or shopping across a stage.<br /><br />Having read some of the Amazon reviews on this book, I was ready to chuckle at Jane's sour milk mood expressing itself entertainingly through satiric sneers against certain sub-cultural agendas which prodded the sore spots in Jane's contemplations of an \\"empty nest\\" coming soon.<br /><br />It doesn't take a brain-iac to catch the depth being deftly woven through themes rising crisply from the novel's title, as they surge subtly through the first few pages of Jane's cranky anticipations of adjustment to diminishing motherhood; tying into Shelley's car screeching into her driveway (seeming on two wheels); then pausing over the posh lunch with the feminists.<br /><br />Jane isn't spitefully bashing hardcore feminism in this novel.  She's understandably reacting viscerally to the contrast between her life passages and the pedestals which some personalities seem to have the privilege to preen and prod upon.<br /><br />Churchill's style is sneaky, subtle and smooth.  Love the continued slow-perk sharing of daily routines between Jane and Shelley, two friends whose personalities should clash, clamor, and clang. Instead this unlikely pair is entertained more than irritated by the other's foibles as they saunter through simple activities, or argue over committing to overwhelming projects which many women would die for but don't have the freedom, opportunities, or time to enjoy (be hired as decorators in a remodel of an old mansion? Yes!).<br /><br />Churchill continues to capture with her toe-tapping of terribly touchy issues, lightly exposing the barefoot essence of pros and cons, without kicking the door down with her personal bias, a bias which is entertainingly clarified with humor through the sarcastic snips and snide asides written gracefully enough to offer no offense to un-invested readers, whatever his/her political-social prejudice.<br /><br />Yet someone in the story was offended enough by something to find a cause to kill.<br /><br />The way Churchill deals with hard-core feminism reminds me of a passage in Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED in which Dagney Taggert pauses in temporary terror over tangible concerns, as she suddenly realizes that women don't run railroads.  Then she recalls that she has been, in reality, running her father's industrial empire; her brother, as President, has always been a figurehead fool.  Her panic discounted in a heartbeat of deduction, Dagney spits, \\"To hell with that,\\" instantly emerging beyond all concerns about her gender, satisfied to C.E.O behind the scenes.<br /><br />At the point of dealing most directly with this issue in Mabels, Jane asks a couple of the women carpenters if they had trouble working in a male dominated industry, to which they replied that once a contractor saw their impressive portfolios, the gender question was simply released; respect and need for competence took precedence.<br /><br />The seven Mabels caricatures move through the plot in well drawn style, fleshed-out into a Norman Rockwell styleof living types.  The reading is easy, relaxing, and involving; the themes have depth without investing in irritating pushes toward political agendas; the mystery is suspenseful without going overboard, trying too hard to outdo the ultimate in convolutions in the genre.<br /><br />Refreshing, delightful, insightful, almost as good as a simple, satisfying life, Churchill's seven Mabels paint every day reality into letters on a page, without once slipping on a banana peel into a boring passage of prose.<br /><br />How does she do this; how does Jill Churchill make depth and complexity look so simple, fun, and easy!<br /><br />With Awe,<br />Linda G.

US	14242930	R1V0EH9BF9P43L	0449221431	922984988	The Novel	Books	5	4	7	N	N	A Living Literary Gem Set In Gestalt of Historic Novels	It is very likely that, within the prolific progress of his production as an historical novelist, Mr. Michener received hoards of letters from writers who had spent a few years bruising foreheads on publishers' warded doors, then wised-up and tip-toed around to the alley looking for an in through an established author.<br /><br />THE NOVEL is a response to this and much more (\\"this\\" being the situation of budding authors wanting to know how a manuscript gets published after it has been finished with the flair of an expert, the final period identified by typing \\"-30-\\" instead of \\"The End\\").  A telling book about the gestalt of publishing, focusing on the midwife process of book-length-fiction, THE NOVEL releases the secrets of its journey from conception to The New York Times Best Seller List<br /><br />Intriguingly, THE NOVEL is significantly shorter than Michener's other novels, and it's written in a somewhat experimental storytelling technique.  In Michener's other novels he uses honorable, tried-and-true techniques, those of a master novelist (actually he glorifies these established techniques with his brilliantly polished craft).  Yet, in THE NOVEL, an anomaly in his fiction collection, Michener experiments outside-the-box of age-old, proven techniques, bursting forth with an offering which I could rave through fogged Rose Tints.<br /><br />In this toe-in-the-water literary experiment, Michener separates his narrative into four illuminating Parts, each written from the unique, First-Person-Narrative points-of-view of The Writer, then of The Editor, then of The Critic, and then of The Reader.  As far as I know, in his other works of fiction Michener plots and composes from a by-the-book-of-narration point-of-view, i.e., pick only ONE and do it precisely and perfectly:<br /><br />Either use Omniscient Observer; OR First Person Narrative; or Third Person Observer, etc.<br /><br />Valid reasons have supported the rigid rule in narrative craft into a long life; the rule says, \\"Pick your Person (poison?), or Narrative Point-of-View, and STICK with it.  Then tell the story from A to Z.\\"<br /><br />Switching Narrative style has been a firm \\"No No\\"; once The Novel had established Lukas Yoder in First Person, the whole book would have been written from that point-of-view, i.e., \\"I am Lukas Yoder and I got up this morning at 5 am feeling ... Here's how I see my editor, critic, and reader ...\\"<br /><br />Too many experimental works of fiction, as I believe Michener exposes well in THE NOVEL, gleefully toss out all the rules and write a piece-of-work so incomprehensible, so unidentifiable, so \\"out there\\" as to be impossible to READ, let alone enjoy or, heaven forbid, escape into and live vicariously with well drawn characters who follow the rules of story-living.<br /><br />Michener breaks the narrative rules just enough in THE NOVEL to have produced a refreshingly delightful, yet poignant and powerful literary work.  Michener's other novels have evidenced him as a great traditional novelist who's established a noteworthy niche in the historical genre.  In THE NOVEL, he's delivered a literary presentation equal to the term (which, unfortunately, often brands any work of fiction with the stigma of being boring or depressing).  Yet, THE NOVEL is far from dull or depleting; it provides a rich reading experience, alive with Pennsylvania Dutch ambiance bridged into the glitzy world of NYC publishing.<br /><br />Each of the Four parts of THE NOVEL work so well that the dramatic-display-of-differences among each of the four is clarified through a glass brightly; the nuances of each part are painted in oil-color, brilliant-contrast as they neatly emerge among antithetical ambiances of Writer, Editor, Critic, and Reader.  When they're read sequentially within the bindings of this novel, these four unique gestalts interweave warmly, coalescing into a portrait of the dynamic dichotomy of the world of, in, and around the living force of the Novel.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Michener.<br /><br />I have the greatest admiration for one who has first mastered craft, then toyed with It tastefully, teasing the reader away from immediate reality, then retaining the best traditional glue to hold a reader enthralled within a literarily linguistic work of fiction.<br /><br />In an E-mail sent 9/4/05 to Tamar Myers (author of exquisite PenDutch mystery series featuring Magdalena Yoder) I wrote:<br /><br />>> Don't know if you've read JA Michener's THE NOVEL, but I recommend it very, very highly.

US	14242930	R1MNBKXCIWZ2YB	0440216419	951323617	The 27-Ingredient Chili Con Carne Murders: A Eugenia Potter Mystery (Eugenia Potter Mysteries)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Beyond The Grave; Gaining On The Murder Monster	Preferring the clarity of focus of a solitary mind, I normally detour around dual authorship fiction.  But, in the case of Nancy Pickard's continuing the late Virginia Rich's Eugenia Potter series, I was intrigued by the potence of a fictional character surviving the grave of her creator.<br /><br />I chose \\"The 27 Ingredient CHILI CON CARNE MURDERS\\" as my introduction to this Genia character, because it contained contributions from both authors, with Nancy working from plot notes Virginia left behind.  That Chile offering bridged Rich's original three Potter novels, to Pickard's two continuations (two published, as far as I know).<br /><br />Reading the Chili novel, I could easily see why Eugenia Potter had prevailed in her fictional world, and into our reality.  She has embodied the prime ingredients of the endearing and enduring profile of Female Amateur Sleuth, the spunky, curious, \\"older\\" (or at least mature) woman seasoned with wisdom, wit, and wherewithal.<br /><br />Who is Miss. Marple, Jessica Fletcher, Mrs. Pollifax, Chas Wheately, etc.?<br /><br />It's uncanny that Eugenia is not only a spin-off of Virginia's personal life, but Genia fits-like-a-dove into Nancy's life as well.  These two authors didn't know each other prior to each publishing a mystery of her own.  Yet both authors were wives of cattle ranchers in the Southwestern US, with each couple owning a cottage in the Northeast.  The main path divergence (if I recall my research correctly) is that Nancy is a decade or two younger than Virginia was, and is still enjoying the companionship of her cattle rancher husband; on the other hand, Virginia's husband is the survivor in that marriage.  Though ... I might wonder who survived what.<br /><br />Don't want to get into the story of these two authors, other than to say that the situation is so coincidentally uncanny as to be almost eerie, seeming very much like a pre-destined, meant-to-be deal.  Of course, at this point in my life (prior to sprouting wings myself), I have speculations but no clues to the true underpinnings of this awesome parallel.<br /><br />In any case, I'm thankful to have a continuing line of Potter mysteries to enjoy. (Potter ... is there something about that NAME??)<br /><br />Chapter One of the Chili book tastefully toyed with a paranormal conundrum, as it opened with Eugenia thoughtfully preparing an Albondigas Soup, talking to herself as she absently handled herbs.  I love an author who's able to capture readers with sensual ease, without resorting to surging the heartbeat to the heavens with a sudden, searing shock.<br /><br />Eugenia's self-dialogue introduces an intuitive intrigue, as she wonders why she's slipped into unlikely behaviors and seemingly inappropriate spice choices, which don't fit her normal routines and present setting.  Soliloquies and actions seem to be pivoting on a paranormal precipice of an impending dramatic change.  Around this puzzling pique, Eugenia remains generally at one with herself and her morning machinations.  With the reader salivating over the soup aroma's aura, the story slithers forward with such a natural flow that the reader is retained throughout the plot, without realizing that the novel has accomplished an absolute kidnap.<br /><br />How can a book be a cozy, relaxing read, yet prevent the reader from noticing he's holding a book rather than walking through it?  The continual \\"ins\\" are so seamless, I never noticed (so didn't dread) that awkward few seconds of releasing reality and tuning into a novel, when effort is required to shift gears and re-connected with the characters.<br /><br />Add to these ever-present, engrossing, easy entries, a mystery which has a full-bodied complexity, a depth and timelessness worthy of the sleuth herself.  Opening the book to any page sets off the aura of one of those ancient tomes of true fiction, which transport the old-soul-richness of a born and reborn story-weaver.<br /><br />According to certain reports,Virginia Rich was the first true culinary author to be inspired to include recipes in a novel.  Of course Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe series initiated a sleuth surrounded in gourmet goodies, but, Rich flamed up foodie features by offering The Recipe, sliding the realm of fiction closer to the sensual reality of life.<br /><br />If this seeming \\"pre-destiny\\" continues, crossing borders of authors and sub-genres, we Earth residents may well discover a recipe for ending the mystery of murder.<br /><br />Wide-Eyed & Hopeful,<br />Linda G.

Graaawerrrr!<br /><br />True to her series' successful addictions, again Fluke provides readers with an anticipated invite into morning routines with Hannah's macho cat, Moishe, this time introducing the battle of the Crunchies.<br /><br />This cat continues to do a reader capture, maybe a kidnap.  His shenanigans could make a cat-a-phobic warm up to hair balls.  If possible, Moishe has kicked up the flavor of his mystique in this Fudge cupcake venue.  Wonder if he's ever heard Emile bam around his TV stove-top?  Loved the various executions Moishe devised for flavorless Crunchies.<br /><br />\\"To be or not to be; that is the question ...\\"<br />-- Shall the choice be for Crunchies of grrreeeeaaat taste but bad rep?<br />-- Or shall it be nada taste with \\"Good-for-you\\" tag-of-approval?<br /><br />I have the uneducated taste to ask, is there even a question?<br /><br />The Vet has advised Hannah to cajole Moishe to gobble up Senior Cat Food, with a force-feed-tag included if necessary.  Throughout the novel I pray that Hannah wises up and gives Moishe his \\"burger\\" HIS way. (This was a ruff-n-tumble alley cat prior to Hannah taking him in; eating who knew what out of the sewers of life.)<br /><br />Of course Hannah's morning ministrations wouldn't be complete without her unwelcome mother clanging into a busy daughter's life, a mother reviled with relish, so much so that whenever the comely cat sniffs The Mother's presence, even over telephone wires, Moishe hisses with ears back, tail twiching warning.<br /><br />Dolores doesn't appear to be a Joan Crawford parading the \\"Mommie Dearest\\" mystique.  The M.D. (Mother Dolores or Mommy Dearest a la Swensen) here is merely a nosey, critical, demanding, domineering, bad taste influence in Hannah's life, a woman who always refers to Hannah, tellingly, as \\"dear,\\" and never hits a good time to step into Hannah's constant rush.<br /><br />Fluke develops characters with a generous pen, with just enough savory spice and redemptive reprieve.  It seems that Fluke dearly wants to paint Dolores as a hometown, modern day, sour-milk-mamma, destructive to a daughter's spirit shining gleefully off-beat to her own drummer.  Yet, as I continue reading the Hannah Swensen series, I catch welcome flashes of redemption flickering through devious Dolores's seemingly thin veneer of character.<br /><br />Myself being a 57 year-old-reader who will forever grieve the loss of a Mom; who grieves the loss of ongoing opportunities to show deserved appreciation and admiration to that treasured woman while she was alive and healthy; who grieves not having been able to adequately (do we ever get there?) welcome that woman into every day's routines while there was still vitality to share ...<br /><br />As a mature (sort of) woman now myself, and having been somewhat like Hannah in my (seemingly) long gone youth, I welcome any flash or flicker of Hannah's developing an expanded generosity toward Dolores's foibles.<br /><br />Fluke continues to sensitively paint Hannah defending her valid youthful needs for independence and space, appealing to women like me who identify too well with the conflict of an ageing, single mother needing validation and compassion for a rapidly arriving life passage, a passage which can be antithetical to a young daughter stretching and strengthening a new backbone.  That tricky, relationship-demand is a worthy, vital one to feature in fiction.<br /><br />Though all of us have irritating personality rough spots, and though any mother is in a potent position to harm the psyche of a child ... hmmm ... lost my train of thought there.  I was probably trying to say that my Mom and I were human enough to have mild personality-clashes and need-dichotomies, but she was a woman who had earned admiration and respect.  She was a Margie, not a Dolores. Gotta remember that as I continue reading this series.<br /><br />Returning to a well plotted novel with plenty of perky maternal ambiance, in this Fudge Cupcake w/Secret Ingredient story, the Mother's hoarding a secret! This twin pair of secret-plot-yarns shored my curiosity to an entertaining level, kept it there, and tucked the threads into a denouement tapestry to weave for.<br /><br />Enjoyed the morning routine twist in this book when Hannah was dreading Dolores's voice on the phone and heard Andrea instead.  Liked the fact that Dolores distanced herself a bit from her daughters in this book.  Maybe Dolores is stepping out of a warn-out character, turning the tide of interest toward her instead of away?  Is this a good sign for those daughter readers who've lost Mom and felt that loss?  I hope so.<br /><br />Also enjoyed the focus on Mike in this mystery, with Norman kept off page somewhere through most of the plot (though I honestly like both these men, almost equally).  The draw of Mike's sex appeal is played up well in this book, stimulating Hannah's bemoaned lack of sophistication into steaming up her cookie wagon windows, as she happily learns a little late in life about adolescent auto alignment.  Fluke fills up the tank of readers' questions about to whom (when, why, and where) Hannah will give an exclusive commitment.<br /><br />With coffee for blood, this cozy author percolates ongoing, unanswered questions.  I won't say which ones were answered here and which ones were tabled for later treats.  I'll just say I closed the book with hunger pangs satisfied, yet with an appetite for the newest hardback in the series.  Yum.  Peach Cobbler on a glossy purple jacket!<br /><br />Or.  Maybe I should get the Sugar Cookie Murder first?<br /><br />Reading Amazon Customer Reviews on both will help spotlight that choice.  (See my review on CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE MURDER for more details on Hannah/Dolores background.  Maybe see my Listmania on Fluke's Frosting, too, while you're at it.)<br /><br />Thanks, Joanne, for a roaring good book with multiple bonuses of flavor!<br /><br />Long Live Yum & Fun,<br />Linda G.

Her sleuth character, Hannah Swenson's in a precarious morning snooze in her comfy condo.  Moishe, her cat with an attitude, captures with his too cute pillow shenanigans.<br /><br />Love the way Fluke cozies the reader right into Hannah's world, repeating in her novels certain trademarks of down-home appeals.<br /><br />Being home, sludging through morning routines of getting up and ready for work are a great \\"move in\\" technique for a cozy culinary.  And Moishe's personality is solid and warming, especially with his history of abuse being continually erased by Hannah's morning-noon-and-night ministrations.<br /><br />Next homespun trademark is The Phone Ringing as Hannah's gotten her motor purring and is rushing out the door, headed toward her cookie shop to begin baking at 0'Dark-Thirty.<br /><br />Hannah's character is developed in many effective ways, one of these being her adherence to having a phone on the wall in the kitchen, tying her to the kitchen table and a cup of coffee for conversations which often become extended delays to her rush to work.  Mobile phones are available in the time frame of the Swenson series, and I would prefer one myself, but I enjoy following a character who's true to her quirks (or flukes) of emotional needs.<br /><br />Of course, if a book doesn't take off with a zoom after a morning routine collects the reader, the settle-in will sour into a restless escape from instead of into the story.  In this plot, Fluke doesn't disappoint.  I'm in the story throughout, and, by the way, I enjoy the in-plot stirring of cookie dough and stimulation of taste buds.  That's just one of many appeals to the senses which have lifted culinaries into a coup of a side-genre initiated by Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe, taken the next step by Virginia Rich's Eugenia Potter including recipes, solidified into a Hall of Fame by Diane Mott Davidson, and fed luxuriously by every one of the authors now fueling the frenzy with several books in a \\"Yum\\" series.<br /><br />There are lots of cookie monsters out there, and Fluke comfortably captures them by their tongues; Lemon Meringue Pie works this taste bud predilection well.<br /><br />A bonus for me in this plot was the purchase of an old house to remodel into a dream, and I enjoy the relationship reality of Hannah's continually comparing her two beaux.  This book in the Swenson series is especially fueling of that contrast, heightening the suspense there.<br /><br />The murder and its resolution are well within the entertaining intrigue category.nzy with several books in a \\"Yum\\" series. <br /> <br />There are lots of cookie monsters out there, and Fluke comfortably captures them by their tongues; Lemon Meringue Pie works this taste bud predilection well. <br /> <br />A bonus for me in this plot was the purchase of an old house to remodel into a dream, and I enjoy the relationship reality of Hannah's continually comparing her two beaux.

This is my first Claudia Bishop book, my first stay at The Inn at Hemlock Falls.<br /><br />The writing was good enough that I easily checked-in at the reception desk, and was happily ensconced throughout the plot as an invisible observer, sometimes chuckling at character shenanigans, sometimes wide-eyes at crisp realism in a cozy culinary.<br /><br />The ambiance of plot, characters, descriptions, and dialogue were so seamless I didn't notice them; I felt as if I were unlocking my room's door with a personal key each time I reopened the covers of the book.  That type of seamlessness is a feat, even for a wordsmith, since most novels slip into \\"effort\\" at least once in a while and the reader can feel the writer's presence as the author works to be intriguing, diddles with dialogue, or pulls on reserves to pen with panache (like I'm doing here!).<br /><br />Bishop seems to have perked right along, living in her story, rambling through a manuscript with her characters, as one of them (Quill).  Love the exchanges between the sisters (Quill and Meg) and other characters; all the book's residents feel to be very homo-sapiens, yet they border (giving great fun to the reader) on being caricatures.  I could almost see the characters strutting across pages, or shambling, in the case of Hedrick, \\"this journalist\\" who could definitely step out of A PINCH OF POISON and into a comic book without a paper glitch.<br /><br />The second murder scene was rivetingly realistic, one of the best I've read in a mystery.  It was simply, chillingly, graphically narrated with the deft pen (excuse the unseemly simile) of a gourmet chef wielding a razor-edged butcher knife, including only the balsamic necessity of the essence of the event.  It reminded me of a death scene in another great novel I'll hold in my hands one day.<br /><br />The ending pulled an intriguing, Agatha Christie type of Murder of Roger Ackroyd, in which the culprit is beyond what would be anticipated in detective fiction, yet fully acceptable within parameters of plot.  I don't see any flaws in this mystery.  But, then, I love great escape novels, and seem to have a knack of picking out those works which become, for me, the Five Starred feats among the offerings.<br /><br />Thank you, Claudia!!<br /><br />With Respect,<br /><br />Linda G.

Descriptions of the lake lulled me into the story, especially the Loons calling through a foggy cocoon of morning dew, savoring the sanctuary of solitude.<br /><br />Characters immediately began rooting themselves into my mind.  I identified with John Kipling's wallowing in the Lake's ambiance, and was properly disgusted with Terry Sullivan.  Terry's ugly character was exposed early in the story, through John's memories of him prior to accepting, and during a phone call from Terry.  The telephone ambiance was an ingenious preface for cringing through Lily's buying into Terry's nice guy routine, exposing how con artists worm in, not just to the young.<br /><br />At first, Lily came across to me as painfully naive, probably because I've been there and don't want to recall that vulnerability.  Her situation leading up to and through the Boston Post article was dramatized so well my stomach was in nauseous knots.  Unfortunately, I was out to breakfast with my husband at the time, anticipating a steaming Denver Omelet with melted American Cheese slithering over caramelized onions and green peppers!<br /><br />Drooling over the first heated bite, \\"Yum\\" released tension as curiosity surged, \\"How would Lily handle this traumatic situation.\\"  I was hoping she wouldn't leap from raw gullibility to a bitter mistrust of journalists.  When she met John, she might collect the sum of her sour grapes and dump them onto John's puzzled head, \\"WHAT'D I do???\\"<br /><br />I was hoping John wouldn't mistrust Lily as well, smelling some of the contrived miasma around her aura.<br /><br />A too frequent situation for budding relationships, learning to determine who and how to trust is a worthy subject for a novel.  Trust is a sensitive, potent issue.  Even people of the highest integrity can let us down, sometimes having no choice.  Maturity seems to solidify after a candidate realizes this; the richness of the human character has capacity for even the best intentions to err and be redeemed.<br /><br />In a comment posted on her web site, Delinsky notes that only one of her characters was so dark as to be irredeemably evil, which had me wondering which bad guys would be Phoenix-ed from skillfully developed character trash.<br /><br />In spite of the angst-ridden ride, I wanted to continue; the characters had me hooked; how would they handle the bad raps and smudged reps and grow through them.<br /><br />Lily had been tossed into a stagnant pond without a pad!  The polluted fringes in the political and religious establishments leaped out to protect themselves, abandoning Lily thoughtlessly, heartlessly, and unequivocally.  Hoping Lily would eventually submerge smelling like a \\"rose,\\" I trudged through the dramatically decorated swamp of character assassination by the media.<br /><br />If LAKE NEWS had been tagged a work of \\"Good Literature,\\" Pulitzer Prize stuff (which like many people, I can't force myself to pick up), I would have dropped the book into the coal stove, because I'd guess that everyone would come out smelling like the swamp they'd be stuck in, having grown \\"wise\\" and deciding to accept the stench as \\"That's all there is,\\" or \\"That's REALITY.\\"<br /><br />Give me a break! (And a chimney sweep.)<br /><br />Thankfully, Delinsky provided refreshing breaks throughout LAKE NEWS. (Though, I doubt she gives out bonus brooms instead of T-shirts.)<br /><br />Some novels are solid \\"live ins.\\"  Others are just good entertainment.  LAKE NEWS is intense \\"live in\\" entertainment.  That's part of the reason I craved returning to the town and residents.  Of course any plot like LAKE NEWS, relating to issues of writers will call to me, as long as the characters have any life in them at all.<br /><br />What is LAKE HENRY?  The idealized small town atmosphere captured me (and obviously a lot of others), even though I also enjoy big city and exotic settings.<br /><br />LAKE HENRY'san esthetically appealing, small town to nestle into, with warm, vulnerable characters to live with.  Detailed dynamics of personal relationships evolve there with an engrossing ease.<br /><br />Especially the conversations and unspoken exchanges between John and his father are realistic, telling, rich, and intriguing.  Those passages expose Delinsky's instinctive awareness of psychological machinations which she weaves warmly beyond cold conclusions of textbooks.  She seems to have lived viscerally, at a level where the phony fear to tread.<br /><br />LAKE HENRY has it all, including short sensual statements which make the novel's world breathe.  As an example among hundreds:<br /><br />\\"The sun fell steadily toward the western hills, silhouetting the evergreens that undulated along their crests, spilling shadow down the hillside, and still she sat.\\"<br /><br />The word choices of \\"steadily, silhouetting, undulated, spilling shadow\\" are luscious paint brush slides of oiled color over perfectly cracked canvas.  Delinsky's an artist in so many ways.<br /><br />I loved the way Delinsky began painting the town around Lily's drama.  Willy Jake's warning to a reporter from Rhode Island was an inducement to leap into cheerleader mode:<br /><br />\\"Signs say no huntin', no fishin', I add no badgerin.\\"<br /><br />Of similar cheering effect was Charlie's announcement to a cluster of people that DATELINE NBC was in town.  No one would have an easy time slithering around behind the scenes in LAKE HENRY, what with the enormous spotlights everyone was slinging around, shining synthetic sunlight on any hint of potential slime getting a foothold on the slippery shores surrounding the lake.<br /><br />LAKE NEWS characters spew jewels of sentences packed with meaning, or highlighting right ways to balance ambitious goals with the command to \\"Stop and smell the roses.\\":<br /><br />\\"... fall was definitely in the air.  It was worth lingering over, and he would do that, but not just now.\\"<br /><br />Most readers past 30 know what it took for John to grow to easily make that choice (at the opening of the novel)  with just that awareness, a honed instinct sensing what to do now and what to do later.  The reader knows he'll deal with that particular \\"later\\" at just the right moment.<br /><br />LAKE NEWS is an emotionally rich, satisfying story, hospitably providing calm spaces of healing within every enthralling storm.  The good guys are engaging, absolutely lovable, and real; the bad guys are almost too real, yet their edges soften somewhat as the reader learns their history, seeing how the dark can etch away and overwhelm natural needs to love.<br /><br />This novel delivers a full-bodied complexity of families, friends, and communities as they labyrinth toward the simplicity of easy intimacy, rooting itself as wounding secrets are released.<br /><br />In LAKE NEWS journalism was perfectly and simply portrayed at its worst and best.  I applauded that accomplishment, as I enjoyed the escape of the reading ride.  The medium of newspapers and magazines holds a key to something magical; it's  idealized it as a special venue for viewing the world; sometimes it accomplishes the promise of elevation of the art of life.<br /><br />This book was as refreshing a read as an unexpected brush of coolness into the white heat of an apex summer day, as solstice crests and edges slowly toward fall.<br /><br />Linda G.

The title and cover art hit home like a stray sunbeam laser-ing through a rainbow, forcing me to believe again that my broken dreams can leap to the Moon, salute the sun, then drift star dust to earth to root and bloom.<br /><br />But, I wondered, could any story reach the level of pure aesthetic spirit which this title and cover bring to life?  I'd be satisfied placing the book on the coffee table, fueling off the prism of cozy hope radiating from the design. I'm beyond impressed, more like gleefully shocked, that the novel lives up to the gleaming spirit graced on the cover.<br /><br />I regularly search the carnival of supermarket bookshelves (now I search Amazon) for novels with a character whose creativity surges, then sparks simply and perfectly into business success. I am so tired of seeing my sparks FIZZLE!! I love the way Adam gently leaves home, travels in simple grace to a strange town, exchanges a heated scene with the woman designed for him the first day and hour he descends from train to city street, then roots himself into a job preset for him to base line his talent and effectively seed a financial oak tree.<br /><br />Wow.  Belva Plain, you have mastered the alchemy of vicarious.<br /><br />The handwriting in my DNA says that's how life should take rhythm from the soul and manifest into material glory.<br /><br />The writing style in this novel moves in simple prose through Adam's easily flowing consciousness; it reminds me of watching my Mom do the two-step with her brother, sliding in jazzy swirls through sawdust scattered on a bar room floor.  Margie and Charlie, born in 1920 and 21, Italian to the core, would slip, twirl, and sidestep in The Waltz set free to dance a natural course.  Circles and glides, dips and skips, the two moved with ease through patterns of the soul, designed by the times.  Ms. Plain writes like that.<br /><br />Nearing page 70 of this heavenly release, I noticed that, through each passage I had been feeling, \\"Yes! This is how life was meant to be.

I replaced the book on the supermarket shelf (that was before I discovered Amazon's wish list and the ease of electronic shopping carts).  On a few different occasions, I again picked up the book, gathering faith, before I dropped the paperback into my shopping cart, almost a month later.<br /><br />I had finally worked through my auto pilot's too-good-to-be-true warning, \\"A guy writing a sensitive story?  He'll probably be one of those Pulitzer Prize gurus who twists readers hearts into wanting to exit through an invisible, clouded sunset, deciding never return to the emptiness, the hopeless horror of Earth.\\"<br /><br />After finishing the book, I set it down with a gentle reluctance, saturated with awe, admiration, and appreciation that a book could live up to the siren's call of a sensationally soulful cover.  I see now why THE FOREVER YEAR is marketed by Amazon as comparing to the novels of top-of-the-line female authors, including Delinsky's FLIRTING WITH PETE.<br /><br />Anthony is a true male, no doubts about that; yet his writing softens raw realism with a healing grace, exposing with crystal clarity and compassion the visceral levels of life and intimacy in the present day emotional labyrinth.  The generation gaps (there are at least two) between Jesse Sienna and his dad, Mickey, are delightfully portrayed through generously disbursed treats of hilarious, heart warming, on target  dialogue between this superbly sarcastic father and son.  I laughed out loud so often I was getting tired having to stop reading to explain to my husband what was so funny.<br /><br />I fell in love with father and son, though Mickey was definitely wiser than the loveably strutting, yet genuinely sensitive Jesse, who thought he was so beyond his father in relationship sophistication.  Anthony portrays the dichotomous psychological set of these males with the skill of a psychiatrist wielding the talent of a seasoned wordsmith, who has lived lifetimes beyond textbooks and writing seminars.  Moreover, Anthony is such a natural artist, his drama, description, and dialogue flow effortlessly.  The reader doesn't notice how skillful the execution of the novel is until he's finished reading it and has enjoyed a few weeks of the story rambling pleasantly through leisure thoughts.<br /><br />Anthony doesn't develop characters, he traps real people into books.  If anyone ever hypothesized that authors are creative, mind-over-matter, Beings-in-training, Anthony would stack the evidence with his ability to paint reality on paper, better yet, a reality worth living.<br /><br />This book had several gifts for me, even beyond the experience of reading an entertaining work of escape fiction with rare cathartic depth.  In a sense, all these gifts coalesce for me into this fact:<br /><br />The existence of this novel exposed to me that TOR, the publisher of THE FOREVER YEAR, is expanding with the market, actively opening its doors to serious, accomplished writers offering the type of polished manuscripts which will feed the evolving needs of the reading public, manuscripts exactly like the collection I've been sitting on for two decades.<br /><br />With Regards & Best Wishes,<br />Linda G.

SHADES OF GRACE is the most powerful, engrossing, and cathartic of the 25 novels I've read in Delinsky's collection.<br /><br />What a courageous way for an author to begin this story, from the viewpoint of a mind in early stages of Alzheimer's.  With courage to carry a torch into the darkest corners of trauma, Delinsky treats soulful issues with such grace and compassion that the reader is entertained simultaneous to receiving a handbook for survival through catastrophe.  Her logo should be a cornucopia spilling from a sunrise.<br /><br />Holding wounding memories of loved ones who suffered from Alzheimer's, I was hesitant to pick up this book.  But, knowing that this author treats gut wrenching issues with gentle grace, yet without the slightest denial of the rigors of reality, I decided to take a dive.<br /><br />While I admired the technique of opening the story from the mental processes of Grace in her early struggles with Alzheimer's, as I began reading, I wondered if it might be ineffectively arrogant for an author to attempt to describe, from the deteriorating character's thoughts, a mental process of such complex nuance, which the author hadn't directly experienced herself.  I was concerned that something so raw as a mind losing itself in a particular pattern would come across as a poor \\"best guess\\" riddled with wrong assumptions of cause and effect.<br /><br />I was not disappointed in any way in this real and poignant, special work of fiction.  It was an emotionally satisfying, enlightening journey.  The irony of Grace being an \\"Ann Landers\\" type of syndicated columnist was dealt with flawlessly, exposing elegantly how knowledge and practice of a precisely prescribed book of \\"Manners\\" can become a wasteland of emptiness when one is forcibly exposed to a more raw and honest guide to genuine courtesy and compassion.<br /><br />Who cares which fork is appropriate when the hand has forgotten where the mouth is.  As SHADES OF GRACE evolves, a gentle blossoming occurs in a true family's caring about that vulnerable hand.that vulnerable hand.	2005-03-11

COAST ROAD being the 6th novel I'd read of BD's work, I had begun to notice that her fiction creates a state of mind similar to what one of my readers (a US Marine) described about my work, \\"I was reading and reading, and all of a sudden I realized I had forgotten I was reading and felt I was just thinking my own thoughts.\\"<br /><br />Delinsky's fiction is so naturally and seamlessly real that I had, with COAST ROAD, decided to quit trying to pick out what works about her writing techniques, and to allow myself to just \\"be there,\\" ironically slipping into a peaceful dream-like luxury similar to that of resting in a coma along with Rachael, receiving rather than responding, while her family and friends shower her with the balming presence of every variety of perfect love.<br /><br />Almost as cathartic as the regeneration of the soul-link between Jack and Rachael was the beautiful, believable transformation of 15-year-old Samantha from a highly annoying super brat into a sensitive, appealingly gutsy young woman.  What I admire most about this novel, though, is that it is told from a man's point-of-view, exposing simply and gently how tremendous emotional growth could occur in even the most Macho Male.<br /><br />Even shored up by 5 previous Delinsky novels, I was concerned that a story about a woman in a coma would have to be sad and depressing, possibly even boring at times.  This book was anything but.  Sensitive, yes, sad but redeeming, and intensely engrossing in a way of deep, pensive satisfaction.  It's another landmark winner of a book.	2005-03-11

AN ACCIDENTAL WOMAN offers multiple means of dealing with potentially debilitating emotional stress.  Characters work through romancing the wheelchair, and having a close friend/mother/wife/caring-woman railroaded and wrongly arrested in the middle of the night; they grow themselves into functional intimacy, and still take time for healthy fun, both private and social.<br /><br />Tragedy has no dominion in Lake Henry; it's hammered out and transformed.  Stress is everywhere.  Yet, everyone deals, and wheels right along, following maple sugar production into the sweet parts of life.  Full time therapy at $$$/hour couldn't do more to show how to LIVE through trauma better than the mood management \\"seminar\\" in this sensitive, delightful novel.<br /><br />Self-help books move over.  Delinsky's fiction does it better, with pleasure (and a never ending supply of enlightened common sense).  This writer wins against all odds.  Her readers win even more	2005-03-11

Instead of abandoning the tale there, BD boldly pulls threads for a new pattern, weaving into strings drifting beyond the love story.<br /><br />Like a twin tapestry, the second half of the novel dances in the moonlight, revels in the sunlight, then unravels the sensuality of community and family, exposing the mysteries of motherhood at the core of life.  Is it because this story taps beautifully into a clear, spiritual wellspring that it feels like a cornucopia of devilish delight and angelic peace?<br /><br />THREE WISHES is a great and appropriate title, but it doesn't even hint of the complex richness of this novel.<br /><br />Delinsky's ability to create a powerful symphony of emotion achieves a crescendo here, as romantic love teams up with the natural need to nurture, and the pair surge a win through all life's barriers.	2005-03-10

I hadn't planned to read that novel because, to me, infidelity stories too often have a Limburger aroma without the payment of flavor.<br /><br />However.  As usual, BD had settled her own tantalizing twist into a sore, slithery subject and given it a too effective, \\"come hither\\" freshness.  After reading only a few preview pages, I wanted to know \\"who done it\\" and why, and was baited to get behind the mystery of the widow.  A love mystery.  Huh.  Ya hooked me again, Delinsky. Can't say I'm sorry you did.<br /><br />It was a lift to buy the paperback of THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR, with its gorgeously cooling, quietly inviting cover.  Based on the title and elegantly feminine cover art, I was prepared to hate Gretchen, since she appeared to be a high-class-call-girl in neighbor's clothing.  I was rewarded with a twist of irony, living with Gretchen's neighbors as they gradually and seamlessly expanded their narrow viewpoints, discovering Gretchen's secrets under the slithering silk skin.  The reading experience was warming and lifting, party due to the genuine growth of awareness in this neighborhood cluster of characters, of what, in real life, goes on under the covers in most households.<br /><br />Is the Big Bad Wolf really bad, Little Red Riding Hood?<br /><br />Finishing the novel with anticipation satisfied absolutely, I was again amazed with how BD takes sorely over-treated issues (in-law interference, infertility, and teen angst in this book) and breathes renewing, healing sparks into these anxiety traps, with her startlingly sensible slants on achieving personal growth.  It's a delight to feel how simply the characters, little-by-little slip contentment into intimate relationships.  They work at it, yes, but they get there, or move on.<br /><br />When I'm rolling in millions from my novels' royalties, I'm thinking to buy the hardback of THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR, to display it as a classy decorator item, with its gorgeous cover advertising a story which lives up to the promise of Art.  (If I still have a house and a body when my ship slips into shore.) Of course I wouldn't need a million bucks to buy a hardback; good novels are an anormous value at any price.WOMAN NEXT DOOR, to display it as a classy decorator item, with its gorgeous cover advertising a story which lives up to the promise of Art.

Of course I wanted to read more; curiosity was precisely stirred from the contrast of negative and positive reactions to this unusual situation.<br /><br />I bought and read THE VINEYARD, becoming fully involved and pleasantly satisfied with the story, even though I hadn't known I would be so thoroughly engrossed in a family owned vineyard.  Was concerned that I might find the history interjections boring and the writing style of an older generation focus a bit too forced (not many writers can capture the beauty and graceful vitality of age until they've arrived there and developed the graciousness).<br /><br />But, BD handled all with just the right amount of detail, genuine warmth, and ingeniously natural intrusion techniques.  For me this book was a reader kidnap, from the first page on.<br /><br />I have mountains of positive input on this exquisite novel, but I'm testing the effect of short and sweet, instead of writing my typical epistle on a novel.

I rarely force myself to read \\"Good\\" books of supposed literary value, which I know, by nature of what intellectuals call literary, will be depressingly soul leaching.  I'm rarely in the mood to immerse myself in a book which will off-set my gyroscope and cajole me into a sudden leap off a 50 story building without my cape.  This is why my reading of choice has often been Historic Romances or Culinary Cozy Mysteries, though I enjoy certain types of sci fi/fantasy.  Once in a while I will cautiously read a mainstream novel, usually by a female author who launched her career in the Romance genre, as Barbara Delinsky did.<br /><br />Well, okay.  I admire certain of the classics.  I certainly admire the exquisite wordsmithing.  I willingly and voraciously read ATLAS SHRUGGED and FOUNTAINHEAD several times each.  There are more glowing examples within the exceptions to my Rule against Good Literature.  But that's not the point I'm rolling over at the moment.  So I'll slither off it.<br /><br />In view of a healthy desire to read what truly is good for me (NOT what I'm told is \\"good\\" for me), I was pleased to easily get into FLIRTING WITH PETE.  Whenever I read anything, in order to apply successful techniques into my own work, I hold a vital question at the front of my mind, \\"WHAT grabs my attention in this reading so that I'm able to comfortably and completely slip into the book's reality and live totally and refreshingly there, at least for the time during which I'm reading.<br /><br />In the case of FLIRTING WITH PETE, as is frequently the capture for me, I wanted to wallow in a situation of luxury, like inheriting a SUPER EXPENSIVE, elegant, luxurious, perfect townhouse such as the one Casey was awarded.  At the outset of the plot, however, if Casey didn't go there and LIVE, without undue agony and foot dragging, I was going to toss the book out the window.<br /><br />Yes!  I was pleased with the way Delinsky realistically dealt with Casey's naturally flowing pro and con feelings, without allowing any misused traits of stubbornness to deny herself (and the reader) the pleasure of that GIFT for too long.  The timing and method of getting Casey into a regular routine at the townhouse was PERFECT.  Yippppeeeeeee!!<br /><br />So, happily and with great, gleeful relish, I was INNNNNNN.<br /><br />And the author kept me there in perfect pacing throughout the novel, even though I drug my feet through Jenny's painful episodes, especially at first.  I found myself skipping to the next Casey segment, reading a bit, to assure myself that there was a reward at the end of the emotionally raw tunnel.  Then, I'd return to the Jenny segment and read slowly, emotionally shored, with breaks between bouts of immersion, to renew my emotional strength and heal my psyche.  I'm an overly sensitive person, and thus I viscerally experience what I read, especially when reading something very well written (in the reader capture sense).<br /><br />I might mention the parallels between Jenny's story and Stephen King's CARRIE, similarities of character and plot.  Delinsky's rendition on this teen-peer-acceptance issue is realistic, as well as beautifully and sensitively done.  As is the case with King's perceptiveness of human nature and angst, Delinsky's psychology background is exposed well here.<br /><br />Even though I have a master's equivalent in psychology, I hated the term \\"dysfunctional\\" upon first hearing it.  While I'm TOO functional myself, I feel that those labeled as dysfunctional are done a criminal injustice.  When Delinsky noted (regarding Flirting With Pete) that she wanted to write about a dysfunctional character (Jenny), at least once, since her characters had all been functional, I was pleased that she drew Jenny as a true heroine with whom a reader could identify (rather than keeping her at a repulsive, psychological \\"arms-length\\"), and brought her from \\"dysfunctional\\" to functional.  Of course, I saw her as functional all along.<br /><br />I liked the older term, \\"Defense Mechanisms,\\" given to the personality dramas creativity exposed in excellent books like, SYBIL, and DIBS, IN SEARCH OF SELF.  Some psychologists have noted that Defense Mechanisms are highly creative, admirable ways certain grossly abused psyches have dealt healthily with very painful, difficult situations.  Rather than looking down long, critically bumped noses at these \\"escapes\\" from realities of torture, these psychologists have shown the various decisive behaviors in the kind, true light of a creative, healthy response, rather than stigmatizing them as dysfunctions, illnesses, neuroses, or psychoses.<br /><br />I've not only been immersed in psychological studies, but I've also worked with police departments in the Portland, Oregon area.  After doing extensive research on the crime, perpetrators, and victims, while hired in the capacity of a community service representative for the Portland Police Department, I gave city-wide talks on rape prevention.  I had read incoming, raw police reports on rape for nearly a year.  With this experience and more, I can say with confidence and \\"backup\\" that Delinsky's characterizations in FWP are realistic, as well as sensitive and triumphantly uplifting.<br /><br />Furthermore, I believe it's harder to write fiction which builds toward true, clean catharsis, than it is to write trash called glorious (usually accomplished in an alcoholic haze) in which deflation, ennui, or downright despair are the unavoidable reader responses throughout the journey, which invariable ends in the bad taste of a dark mood which lingers in miasmatic stench, beyond the last page of such novels of \\"Great Literature.\\"  Yes, I enjoyed tremendously Delinsky's attitude toward this dark type of highbrow-recommended reading material.<br /><br />Thankfully, in view of the way publishers are forced to limit the output of most well-received authors, there are a few other Historic Romance (and other genre) writers who have evolved into mainstream novelists without trashing the healthy reading joys inherent in the Romance genre, the fun plotting, spunky characters, refreshing humor, and guaranteed uplifting conclusions.<br /><br />There's so much more I'd wanted to say about various excellent details of FLIRTING WITH PETE, which struck me as exquisitely done as I was reading, and hoping I would remember a particularly well done statement or segment.  I loved the way Delinsky alternated the Jenny segments subplot as pieces of a typed mystery manuscript offered to Casey as a treasure hunt of sorts, tying it in as her father's therapy technique offered in his own published works.  What a masterful weaving method incredibly well executed.<br /><br />I could go through each chapter and excerpt copious examples of beautifully effective prose; I could compliment methods of dancing within issues and handling of situations; I could point out fun, realistic dialogue; fawn over the abundance of sensual, luxuriously descriptive paragraphs.
