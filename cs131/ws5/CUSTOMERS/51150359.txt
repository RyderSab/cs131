From the dustjacket:<br /><br />\\"This is the first full-length study to be published of the poetry of A.E. Housman....Norman Marlow has investigated the many influences on Housman's poetry, from the little-known books he read at school to the Greek and Roman poets....<br /><br />\\"[Marlow] then analyses the strikingly individual qualities of his style, its combination of Saxon forthrightness with classical precision, its repetitiveness and cunning use of simple metres.<br /><br />\\"Housman's character remained an enigma, and the book begins with a short but fairly complete biographical sketch, while later the element of autobiography in the poems is thoroughly discussed.<br /><br />\\"There is a chapter on the influence exerted in turn by Housman and other poets, and an amusing discussion of the way critics have handled and mishandled his poetry.  This book is concerned mainly with the literary approach to the poems, but will be of equal interest to those who are fascinated by Housman the man.\\"	2005-10-02

James Dickey (1923-1997) was an American poet and the author of the novel _Deliverance_ (1970), which was made into a popular movie starring Burt Reynolds. _Helmets_ was published in 1964. It is divided into four parts, containing  a total of 24 poems.<br /><br />From a 1964 review by X. J. Kennedy:<br /><br />\\"...James Dickey is a poet in search of an absolute. Catching a glimpse of some fleeting reality, Dickey would wrap words around it hurriedly before it gets away. This attitude, which pays small attention to the words themselves and practically none to le mot juste, makes Dickey's work seem deficient in a quality Roethke fought for: verbal surprise. Though working from such different assumptions, Dickey often manages to make his work memorable by the sheer force of what he has to say. For his specialty is curious psychological adventure, as in the moving \\"Approaching Prayer,\\" in which he identifies with a hunted boar while donning the animal's trophy head.<br /><br />\\"In a completely successful and very funny poem about an assignation in an automobile junkyard, \\"Cherrylog Road,\\" Dickey seems to have discovered how to view himself with a new, detached humor. \\"Helmets,\\" his third full collection in five years, is his best yet. It is rich in the relentless intelligence that has made him, incidentally, the finest of our new critics of poetry....\\"	2005-09-27

I could not enjoy this book. If it were more explicit about the sex scenes, it might be successful erotica. But the sex is portrayed as being \\"bad\\" for the main character.<br /><br />In order to appreciate her story, you have to first swallow the underlying assumption that the \\"12 step\\" method will work to cure a sexual \\"addiction.\\" Fact is, this woman was sexually abused as a child, and that why she's been acting out sexually ever since.<br /><br />She is incapable of sorting out manipulative sex from genuine love, so she ends up being a pawn to various men who desire her only for her body. The thing is, she LIKES sex with accquaintances, and finds her husband dull. How is that an \\"addiction?\\" I just can't \\"get\\" the whole confessional/penance-type mindset that is the basis for the treatment.<br /><br />The characters at the treatment center are just as manipulative as those in the outside world. One of them, \\"Gabriel,\\" uses his job to meet sexaholic women & gets himself fired. Ted, the therapist, is a bit unbelievable, considering he is so removed from human sexuality himself while at the same time so convinced of the guilt of his clients.<br /><br />Reminds me somewhat of a modern day story of London's \\"Magdalen\\" hospital, which was a shelter for reformed prostitutes. In a time of great economic injustice, they were given food & shelter, in exchange for agreeing to cease their foul means of making a living.<br /><br />The female character in \\"Love Sick\\" seems to have zero hobbies or personal interests besides lining up sexual affairs. She tries to deny her adult sexuality to please her therapist, yet can't stop herself from contacting men, who are like a drug to her. Ultimately, she realizes how \\"wrong\\" it is, and tries to reform in a humble spirit.<br /><br />On the other hand, a secondary character is much spunkier and  more rebellious, even leaving treatment for a time. I'm not saying that promiscuity is good - of course it's not - just that  it seems illogical to shame women into denying their sexual feelings while failing to help them cope with past personal history of exploitive sex.romiscuity is good - of course it's not - just that  it seems illogical to shame women into denying their sexual feelings while failing to help them cope with past personal history of exploitive sex. <br /> <br />	2005-08-23

The descriptions of the native landscapes and birds are stunningly apt. The characterization of the Russo-German immigrants  - in contrast to the western Europeans, who harbor a prejudice against this group - is memorable.<br /><br />However, as I read deeper into the book, the charming prairie innocence of this novel faded away.  About the time that Mama foiled the robbery and killed a man in her bedroom was when I realized that a new heinous scandal was facing the family in every chapter.<br /><br />I  couldn't believe that the young bridegroom who married the heroine's best friend didn't have guts to tell his mother he got married, even though his suicide left her very pregnant. And I couldn't believe that the heroine actually married the dark, silent type who stole her virginity on the eve of her wedding to another man.<br /><br />This is one of those books that ends at marriage, as if everyone is trouble-free  after getting hitched. The story that *isn't* told is how the heroine holds up after being married to a domineering man who intends her to have a lot of children and still help out in the fields, in the custom of the Russo-Germans, who are seen by the other groups as using up their women as if they were horses.<br /><br />So, a cautious five stars on this book.

It's the story of the Kiowa people, a native American tribe of the southwestern plains &amp; Wichita Mountains, told from the point of view of individual Kiowas. The &quot;Ten Grandmothers&quot; are sacred bundles with special powers which are important to the spiritualism of the Kiowa.<br />The stories in this book are marvelously crafted, and full of life and sensation, and they spread new light on old ways. The chapters feel mythological, yet they help the reader  to understand the shared culture behind the daily life of the Kiowa people.<br />This book was first published in 1945, when there yet remained some very old people who remembered the old-time buffalo days. Historically, the book reads very true.  The events of each chapter are fixed within historical times-lines  which appear in the back of the book.<br />The author, a woman, has gifted us with wonderful portrayals of the life experience of female Native Americans. So often,  women's roles and labors go unmentioned in other accounts of the old days. Alice Marriot wrote an account of the Kiowa that includes the experiences and interactions of people of both genders.<br />Notable chapters include one in which a young woman of seventeen - about to be forced by her relatives to marry a man she doesn't care for - runs off during the annual Sun Dance with a young man her own age. The exacting ritual of the Sun Dance is interspersed with the tribulations of this personal love story.<br />Later, when  their first baby is small, Spear Woman struggles unsuccessfully to fulfill all her home-making responsilibities. Her  unhappiness leads to conflict between the couple, until eventually, he realizes that she has too much work to do and needs female help and companionship. Such a  moving story, for people of any era.<br />And the author brings us forward in time with the Kiowa tribe, from nomadic life into settled agriculture.  And, by knowing what has gone before,  the reader can perceive how their shared cultural history and mythology has colored and formed the Kiowa response to this sweeping change in lifestyle.<br />I can't recommend this stunning book highly enough. What a good read. Definitely a remarkable book for those interested in Native American culture. Do read it if you are interested in the old ways of the plains tribes. An excellent book.perceive how their shared cultural history and mythology has colored and formed the Kiowa response to this sweeping change in lifestyle.<br />I can't recommend this stunning book highly enough.

It's enjoyable reading, not too academic or judgmental, and offers personal observations about child-raising, which the author shares with remarkable personal insight.	2003-09-04

If you are interested in making your own regalia, this will help you get ideas for the finer details. Most of the colorful &quot;outfits&quot; use contemporary as opposed to traditional materials, and with great ingenuity.<br />I believe that the photographers (a husband and wife team) had  a terrific eye for what makes beautiful regalia. The photos are expert and visually enjoyable. Contrary to a previous reviewer, I think the plain backdrop works well. Yes, the book is limited in scope to static (non-dancing) poses, i.e. still portraits.<br />And nearly every photo is accompanied by an inspirational paragraph transcribed from the words of the Native American pictured. Good  reading!<br />My only objection to this book is that since it was photographed  at powwows in the northwestern U.S., it is mainly limited to representatives of tribes in that area. Otherwise, an excellent book!	2003-07-31

I think it's a pretty good overview of the details of which germs cause what illness, and how they're spread.<br />I think the author does a nice job of handling what could be a highly technical subject. The book is comprehensible to the layperson, yet  still difficult enough that you probably ought  to have had college-level sciences in order to understand its complexity.<br />I was hoping that the book (especially considering the picture of the kitchen on the cover) would offer me something new regarding keeping germs and illness away from my family. However, it does not go far beyond the standard  prevention  tactics of good handwashing and modern sanitation. Good handwashing is particularly emphasized.<br />Diseases and illnesses such as smallpox and lyme disease and West Nile and herpes are  handled in detail. It's a  useful and factual introduction to bacteriology and contagious diseases, and  includes some historical references, in a readable text.	2003-07-23

Behind its pleasant packaging is a 2nd-rate narrative that borrows characters, but doesn't fulfill the reader's expectations.<br />Elizabeth has been transformed into a simple worrywort who can't connect with her husband. Darcy doesn't have much personality at all. Mrs. Bennett is made more likeable, but the humor and wit of the real _Pride and Prejudice_ is lacking.<br />All the characters have developed a smallness of mind that is a reflection of a good story in the hands of an incapable storyteller. The entire narrative is imbued with a negativity that Austen fans will find tiresome and juvenile. Re-read the original and skip this one.	2003-07-17

I disagree with the editorial review which opined that this \\"subject matter is likely to appeal more to police or psychology professionals.\\" I am a parent, and not a police officer or psychologist, and I sat down with this book and read it nonstop because it was so compelling.<br />I think the author does a great job of alerting readers to the danger we face from the human predators around us. She works with the Wisconsin Dept of Corrections and in the book has shared dialogue from interviews with a number of unsavory convicted criminals.  Yet the truth is so disturbing that it is easier to blindly believe in an inner good in everyone.<br />The book contains plenty of  insight into the minds of child molesters, and a lengthy focus on deception and lying. There's an overview of how child molesters ingratiate themselves with trusting families in order to get at their victims. And how child rapists are given the freedom to commit their crime again and again  when children aren't believed. \\"Niceness\\" is their masquerade, in the sense that people doubt that someone so \\"nice\\" could be doing something so horrible.<br />The book also discusses victim-blaming,  and why the victims of rape cope by thinking, \\"If only I hadn't done THIS, If only I hadn't been wearing THAT.\\"  And it talks about the wrongness of family therapy as a response to incest, because the perpetrator gets to hide behind the \\"dysfunctional family\\" label.<br />There's a lot more in this well-written book, which I find very relevant to people who want to protect themselves and their own children. I recommend it.	2003-05-23

In this book, Kathleen Newland outlines the dimensions of the change and assesses its impact on economic and social patterns....<br />\\"In the framework of seven broad subject areas - legal status, education, health, the mass media, politics, work, and family life - Newland pinpoints specific topics of concern to today's women. The underestimation of women's economic contribution, the effects of birth control on women's health, the growth in numbers of households headed by women, and the gap between women's formal political rights and their real exercise of political power are a few of the topics examined.<br />\\"In detailing the social and economic costs of sex discrimination, the book argues that outmoded notions about women are a heavy burden for society. The major challenges of the years ahead, concerning population growth, the provision of basic needs, income distribution, and employment, are all problems that cannot be solved without women's full participation. Leaders have for years ignored the justice of women's claim to equal opportunity; it is becoming more and more difficult for them to ignore its practicality.\\"<br />This 1979 book is an overview of women's issues from the perspective of a decade when the status of women was being reevaluated. The book was sponsored by the Worldwatch Institute, and the author received funding from the United Nations Fund for Population Activities.  Interesting from a historical perspective.	2003-02-25

I can match 80-90% of what I have on the shelves with the foods she lists.  But I'm doubtful that I would come up with the same results from the same ingredients.<br />For instance, why do so many recipes in this book call for Tobasco sauce?  And sorry but I can't foresee my family would ever accept ground turkey, or anything containing tofu or lentils. And we LIKE butter!<br />And what's this innovative stuff called \\"broth powder\\"?  What happened to the good old fashioned (and cheap) method of simply saving the water you cooked the meat in?<br />The book opens with a chapter of beverages, but I can't help but wonder how they can be called \\"miserly\\"? Wouldn't drinking plain water be a whole lot cheaper than some concoction from the blender?<br />Good points about this book:  The desserts look delicious. And each recipe in the book is followed by a helpful \\"kitchen tip.\\"  The tips themselves make pretty good reading.<br />However, instead of this book, I would recommend an older (and harder to find) book, called _ Good Recipes for Hard Times_ by Louise Newton.	2003-02-24

It's a superb read, and ought to be brough back into print. This is not a history of wars and dates and politics, but describes the actual lives of people.<br />Each chapter is devoted to a location and a time period, introduces a few fictional characters, and gives a sketch of a segment of their daily lives.<br />From the back cover:<br />&quot;_The Way our People Lived_ recreates scenes of American history in stories full of romance and adventure. Highlighting distinctive moments in the development of American society, it documents the habits and interests, the fashions and fancies of the everyday men and women who helped to build our nation.&quot;<br />My favorite chapter is about a woman who travels to Cincinnati in the 1830s. Lots of perspective on the rapid growth of midwestern cities as well as the status of women.<br />A similar chapter is set in young Chicago in the 1870s, about the time of the Great Chicago Fire.<br />Another favorite chapter is devoted to the Gold Rush, and the dreams and realities that fueled this mad westward escape.<br />Sure, this book has its shortcomings, in the sense that it is a product of the prejudices of its own time (1940s, republished in 1965). Some of the comments about the status of women are made in error, although the author's intentions were good. Plus, the native American experience was totally omitted.<br />However,  I highly recommend this book for a readable version of U.S. history which goes beyond dull political figures, and details the ordinary experiences of real people. You can really get a sense of what it might have been like to live back then.	2003-01-28

The writing style is amazingly readable, which is a stark contrast to the usual dull specifications found in online CSS references.<br />The author shares his detailed understanding of all the quirks of CSS1, and does a good job looking ahead to CSS2.  Even if the reader doesn't follow every particular of every item, it's nice to have a feel for the  programmers intention. I feel as if I have an even better grasp of whole concept of &quot;cascading.&quot;<br />Even though it's a CSS version behind, this book is outstandingly usable for the HTML-familiar web designer who wants to streamline and update to cutting edge code. Personal web page owners would benefit greatly.<br />The only significant drawback to this book is that the book is printed entirely in black and white, which means that all examples are shown in grayscale, not in color. And this lack of color tends to undermine the in-color code examples. You have to use your imagination (or your own computer) to  try out the CSS code to see what it really does on your color monitor.<br />With the exception of this limitation, I strongly recommend this book as a CSS learning tool and reference.	2002-11-29

Sure, it's dated, but every book about the Internet dates quickly. That's because the Internet is growing and changing faster than the book publishing business can publish a book.<br />The author takes us through many aspects of community building and group dynamics point-by-point. I had to take notes, I found it so useful. Ideas are taken from sociology and applied to the Internet. Dry in parts, yes, but very useful as far as clarifying one's ideas about online communities.<br />As the  manager of a small women's community online, I found this book very useful. Much more practical than Amy Jo Kim's similar book, which mainly focuses on the monster-sized for-profit communities.<br />The ideas in this book can be applied to any size online community.

Reservation poverty is described in detail. Domestic abuse and alcoholism also appear here. Plus  Sun Dance self-torture.  Thankfully, many sweat lodge and cedaring-off descriptions dull down the affect of the more shocking parts of Mary Brave Bird's experiences.<br />She falls prey to an alcoholic lifestyle inolving  &quot;party-ing&quot; until you're either beat up or in jail. She eventually leaves her husband, Sioux medicine man Leonard Crow Dog,  and treks across country (with 4 children), moving from women's shelter to homeless shelter, until they all spend a wild three years in Phoenix.<br />Definitely, the alcoholism mars this narrative, and lowers Mary Brave Bird's credibility. Yes, there are a lot of references to the American Indian Movement's  standoff at Wounded Knee. And there's a good chapter about native American traditions with regard to menstruation. And inspiration about fighting for the land.<br />But I can't help wondering if the sort of hopeless drunken revelry portrayed here typifies ALL reservation Indians, and if so, aren't they in fact contributing to the end of their own culture..? Who's watching all those Indian kids while Mom's on a two day drunk?<br />In other words, this is a disturbing book. It's good but scandalous reading.	2002-08-06

Purportedly it is jointly authored by a married couple, but the real narrative is the voice of a German born man who pesters &quot;old Indians&quot; because he wants to live according to  their old time ways.<br />The author's first wife leaves him, probably because she gets fed up with his costly infatuation with the Indians. Or maybe she just gets just tired of hauling water and taking care of a bunch of kids on her own while he traipses around to powwows browsing for a second wife.<br />Anyway, he meets a Blackfeet woman who hastens his inclusion in reservation social life. Thank goodness. But before he becomes related to the tribe, the reader may be shocked by the naivete and gullibility with which he falls prey to every suggestion of elderly Indians, simply because of his strong desire to become one of them.<br />For instance, there is a scene, within the first 60 pages of the book, in which he visits three old people who live in a poverty-stricken shack on the edge of a junkyard. They seem to have nothing to do but sit on the edge of their mattresses and look forward to a lunch made of government commodities. Their water is hauled from a  well outside which is perhaps tainted from the garbage around them.<br />He asks for their advice regarding how to give thanks in an &quot;old Indian&quot; way for the fact that his young son survived a long and worrisome drive to the hospital. They confer in the Blackfeet language (which he doesn't yet know) and decide that would be best for him to purchase a powerful old medicine bundle from one of them for many, MANY &quot;horses.&quot;<br />He promptly decides to sell his wilderness cabin (where his wife and children are living and presumably awaiting his return). He will set aside his half of the sale-price to buy this holy and important medicine bundle. Next thing we know, his wife has split to the nearest town. And he is back to ask a young school teacher to share the medicine bundle duty with him. After this cruel initiation, the reader hopes that he becomes less gullible about acquiring Indian knowledge.<br />I think it's wonderful that he happened to fall in with the Blackfeet at about the time that interest in their own tribal ways was resurfacing. His questions probably helped the Blackfeet around him to become more aware of the importance of maintaining their unique culture.<br />Yet, this is NOT an authentic narrative. Buffalo days were long past, and the life and adventures depicted in this book are no more than historical re-enactment and sometimes wishful thinking.<br />For better and more authentic accounts of historic Blackfeet ways and culture, see books by James Willard Schultz.he is back to ask a young school teacher to share the medicine bundle duty with him.

There are four narratives and a collection of black and white photos.<br />My favorite story is the first one, told by Iron Teeth or Mah-i-ti-wo-nee-ni,  a 95 year old woman born about 1834. Her father was Cheyenne and her mother was Sioux, and she was raised as a Cheyenne. In the time of her grandmother, these Indians had no horses. In her own girlhood, they captured wild horses or went on horseraids south to Mexico. She relates many interesting incidents from daily life as a Cheyenne woman.<br />There are also stories of hunts, heartbreaks, and history. She was part of Dull Knife's village camped on the Powder River that was destroyed by white soldiers  in 1876. And later she was in  the group of people from Dull Knife's band (about 100 people, including children) who were inhumanely imprisoned in a 30 foot square building at Fort Robinson without food or water, until they made a brave and desperate death-defying escape. She lived through reservation starvation and the murder of friends and family members, and into old age to tell this story. What superb reading.<br />In addition to (1) Iron Teeth, A Cheyenne Old Woman, the other narratives are (2)James Tangled Yello Hair, A Cheyenne Scout, (3)Jules Claudel, A White Soldier with the Cheyenne Scouts, and (4) Oscar Good Shot, A Sioux Farmer. This book was created from interviews by Thomas Marquis in the 1920s.  Highly recommended!	2002-05-31

This book portrays a segment of Native American life and culture just before the buffalo were diminished and the people were forced to reservations.<br />Given that  _Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: an Indian History of the American West_ by Dee Brown contains only 2 or 3 pages in reference to the Blackfeet, a book such as _My Life As an Indian_ is a superb addition to one's bookshelf.

But I could not find much that was pertinent to my own life.<br />For one thing, the author traces most or all marital problems to<br />personality and role conflicts in one's family of origin. Life experiences which may have occured before marriage but outside the family of origin are simply passed over, as if they were invisible and did not count.<br />In the same way, there is silence about the multiple outside forces which may negatively impact the life of a family. Poverty, illness, layoffs, social injustice, none of these are discussed, probably because  the couples in this book are financially  cushioned against harsh troubles like these.<br />The more worldly  reader may wonder why these couples imagine they have \\"problems\\" if their biggest conflicts consists only of who will carry the toilet brush into the first of their THREE bathrooms! Why don't they just hire someone underprivileged so they can get on with their privileged lives?<br />Anyway, there are a lot of words in this book, but in my opinion, they describe a fairly narrow set of experiences. I was particularly disappointed that more time was not spent on the massive changes that can take place in a marital relationship once children arrives. Especially when the weight of childcare and housework falls more heavily on the woman's shoulders.<br />There are a lot of omissions which may make this book meaningless for readers outside a certain social class.	2002-04-02

After all, many post-feminist women are discovering, once children arrive, how valuable and precious is the choice to stay at home and nurture one's own family. There is a social movement afoot to reevaluate the traditional unpaid labor of women.<br />But this particular book is not as useful as it might have been, simply because a lot of the ideas and recommendations are bogged down in Christianity-based patriarchy, promoting the mythology of the apron-clad happy housewife who sacrifices for her children, and bows to her husband's God-condoned dominance in the family.<br />Sorry, even though our situations are similar, I can't apply this book to my own life.

Wives, housewives, and rejected lovers will all find words to ponder here.<br />Some of the poems also address Jong's poetic predecessor's, such as Pablo Neruda, Colette, and Mary Shelley, and these little poems may probably cause you to re-evaluate the original authors  in light of Jong's unique viewpoint. Sometimes scathing realism. Graphic language.	2002-04-01

It offers many insights for people involved in today's women's groups.<br />Basically, the author talks about the 1970s feminist consciousness raising movement, and how it impacted the lives of those who were involved.  The book was written during the  1980s doldrums when women's activism had faded for many. However, individual women were feeling isolated and wishing for a rebirth of female community.<br />Today, the Internet has become the means of communication for developing women's communities that are not limited by geography. This book is a guide to leading a women's group with  goals of personal insight and life enhancement. The assumption is that, once we understand ourselves, we can then move outwards and impact the world around us. Good reading.	2002-02-05

She's only doing what her vision of &quot;the Lady&quot; tells her to do, from eating dirt to putting her face into thorns.<br />It is a difficult but well-crafted novel. I read the Ludwig Lewisohn translation from the original (there may be others).<br />While Bernadette and her family suffer harrassment from the authorities, they are supported by the people of the community, who wish so badly to believe in a miracle. I enjoyed the scene where, secretly and after dark, the workmen construct a basin to contain the trickle of water discovered by Bernadette. It miraculously is a flowing spring!<br />I also like the image of the crowds mimicking Bernadette's every  movement as she follows &quot;the Lady's&quot; sometimes irrational instructions each morning. The people so desire to believe that Bernadette's actions have meaning, when the reader suspects that it is all just product of  mental illness. Good historical reading.	2002-01-15

The exquisite line drawings which illustrate this book are erotic yet not &quot;dirty.&quot;<br />The instructions for sexual pleasure in this book would be handy for a young childless couple with a lot of time on their hands and no complicating health problems.<br />Pregnancy and birth control is  never mentioned here. Likewise, the topic of sexually transmitted diseases is utterly overlooked. In a way, this book is a product of its time - the days when AIDS was unknown and the Pill was &quot;In.&quot;<br />It is nice to read a book in which sexuality is not sneaky or abnormal. It may have been a real revolution for the authors to openly talk about the basics of healthy human sexuality.<br />My perception is that the focus is largely on the male experience, with the unique needs of the female omitted. For instance, it is assumed that everyone has the potential to receive pleasure from sex, at any moment.<br />&quot;Non demanding touch&quot; is a good idea. But what about the quality of the NON-sexual side of the relationship? What about the  children and the potential for children? Or Pregnancy, menstruation, breastfeeding?  Economic dependence? Other relationship problems..?<br />Despite its limitations, this book is a kick to read, and may give you ideas to spice up your own bedtime rituals.	2002-01-11

Basically, a woman named Amy Doll keeps boarders upstairs, and when she raises the rent, they resort to prostitution. The boarders are four middle-aged to post-menopausal women - one is almost wholesome, one is exotically foreign, and two are active alcoholics.<br />The novel explores many life situations, romance, poverty, domestic work, etc.  A policeman comes to spy on the old tarts (or so Amy guesses), but ends up being a love-interest and an anchor which enables Amy Doll to demand an end to the unsavory activities upstairs.<br />The author might have made a stronger statement about the working wage, women in poverty, etc., but instead the writing is very plain and lacking in condemnation. The reader is left to draw their own conclusions. The situations are realistic, and this might be called &quot;realism,&quot;  although the sexual activity is mainly alluded to and not detailed.<br />It's a readable book, a product of its era. The contemporary reader might be surprised that such a topic could be dealt with in such a _clean_ manner.	2002-01-06

The goal is to help parents live more easily with their children, by educating them to choose the best response in daily interactions.<br />Bettelheim uses a sort of Socratic method to get parents to ask the &quot;right&quot; questions. This book makes interesting although sometimes dated reading from a childcare expert who was radical in 1962, due to his openness in discussing various topics, such as masturbation, spanking, etc. He  comes off as rather  benevolently patronizing to the various women with whom he speaks.<br />Worth adding to the parenting bookshelf!	2001-12-17

Beginning in 1934, she worked with a number of Indian tribes.<br />This book describes incidents which occurred in the 1950s while she served as a public health nurse. Reservation Indians were mainly illiterate and life was hard. Traders took advantage of craftspeople, and diseases such as tuberculosis were prevalent.

While they hammer and build and pass the time Robinson-Crusoe style, the women silently flutter in and out of their days, teasing them with unattainable femininity.<br />The men devise plans to capture and woo the angel-like women, using &quot;bait&quot; such as mirrors and scarves. Finally they succeed, and in a terrible scene, cut the wings from each woman, forcing them to walk from henceforward.<br />Lots of dialogue about male-female relationships as the pairing off ensues.

The author explores the sick mentalities and daily realities behind the NAZI atrocities of WWII.<br />For intance, just paging through, I came across a scene where two men are driving a vanload of Jewish people, who are slowly being asphyxiated. The men chitchat and drive, occasionally daring to check the progress of their work through window behind them. They have to drive for a period of time so that the carbon monoxide fills the van slowly,  so that the people go to sleep before they die. If the people are asphyxiated rapidly, they tend to die in grotesque poses that disturb the soldiers who must unload the van afterwards.<br />Grisly, isn't? Perhaps this sort of story should be forgotten, not retold and refreshed for another generation of readers. This book is upsetting and you should consider wisely before opening it.<br />Also, it helps to be acquainted with the German language.

Instead I grew impatient and was disappointed with this collection. The opening story by Ursula le Guin is juvenile in both setting and understanding, and the succeeding essays do not rise above this immature beginning.<br />Maybe I feel this way only because there is nowadays no apparent &quot;men's movement&quot; to reinforce macho and threaten me as a woman. Or maybe it is because I am a wife and a mother of boys that I think it shortsighted to condemn those who wish to empower men. To blame men as a gender for the disempowerment of women is to overlook a lot of social and economic complexities or our world. Life is hard for people of both genders.<br />This is a collection of armchair rhetoric to enflame the opposition. I can imagine that ultra-conservative anti-feminists would get a lot of ammunition out of quotes from this ill-conceived book. It is a shame, because there is still a lot to be said for feminism and women's rights. This book, however, is more an example of stray radicalism gone wrong - a sort of &quot;backlash&quot; against an imaginary enemy - than any clear thinking about real social issues.	2001-11-14

I think that her absolutely best novel is _Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont_, a touching portrait of an elderly woman in shrinking circumstances.<br />Taylor had a wry and sometimes morbid and menacing sense of humor. The title story from this collection is about an English couple who take in two little underprivileged black boys for a few weeks in the summer. They wreak havoc on the house, but when they leave, the house has become empty and listless.<br />Taylor's stories are created out of ordinary situations turned haunting. &quot;Crepes Flambees&quot; is set in an exotic locale and touches upon the integration of two cultures. The character Habib lives a life of pretense in order to gain acceptance from his two English acquaintances. His real self/life/home remains hidden, its existence uncertain.<br />Like many of the stories here, the ending is modern and inconclusive. Some readers may enjoy the indecisive endings. Without dramatic action, these stories tend to be more subtle capture of moments in time.	2001-10-11

If you are a stay-at-home parent or a child advocate, this is a guilt-appeasing polemic which will make you angry. What exactly IS that hypothetical notion called &quot;independence&quot; and how does it help a child to be forced to navigate through his or her life alone?  The author looks toward daycare providers and teachers as being &quot;experts&quot; in the lives of children. The role of parent is minimized.<br />On the other hand, if you are a working mother, this book offers practical suggestions for making the most of the time you spend with your children. It gives insight into the interaction of children with their teachers and daycare providers. In addition, there are some  good ideas about father involvement, and valuable information about the development of the preschool age child.	2001-10-11

Buck: A Cultural Biography	Books	5	24	25	N	N	Incredible story - highly recommended	I think that Peter Conn's book is an incredible achievement. It is apparent that he has taken great pains to sort through a massive quantity of letters, published writings, and FBI files about the writer and humanitarian Pearl Buck.<br />Thankfully, this is NOT the sort of dirty-laundry biography, so popular now, which serves only to tear down its subject. Conn is factual and honest to the memory of a great woman, who accomplished much in her lifetime.<br />The book follows Pearl Buck from her missionary origin through her unexpected literary success, into her high-profile career as a spokesperson for Chinese/Eastern issues and the founding of the Welcome House (an adoption agency) and the Pearl S. Buck Foundation.<br />This biography inspired me to read through more Buck's novels. She was so prolific!  I strongly recommend _Good Earth_ and _Sons_, as well as _Kinfolk_, and especially _The Mother_.<br />Conn's biography points out the factors that have led to her omission from the literary canon. Primarily, she was writing about the experience of women during a time when women's issues were dismissed as frivolous and un-literary. Also, she worked at such a great pace, that her writing is uneven, and not all of it of the great quality that earned her the Nobel prize.<br />I think that Peter Conn's book will remain a splendid resource about Pearl S. Buck for years to come! Good reading!	2001-05-22

This is probably the most disappointing of the Commander Toad  books, which my sons, ages 4 and 8, truly ENJOY and even beg for! It is a fun read, but not as outstanding as the other books in this series.<br />The crew receives a  message from a planet inhabited only by doves. It turns out that their beans have swollen and clogged the storm sewer drains, causing the entire planet to flood. Very far-fetched, indeed.<br />The birds sent an SOS to Star Fleet when their wings grew tired from having no place to land. Mistaking their bird language, Commander Toad's crew brings a shipload of beans, which the birds don't really want. They just need dry ground on which to rest.<br />In the end, Commander Toad saves the day by swimming underwater to pierce the swollen beans with his official Star Fleet gadget. Then he must hold on to a statue of the Mayor while everything unattached  goes down the drain! Swallow your disbelief!<br />The reason this book is not as good as the remainder of the series is because, in a few cases, the pictures don't mesh with the story. I.e. the text says Doc Peeper goes to the planet's surface, but the image doesn't show him in the sky skimmer. Also, the plot is even more  oddball than usual.<br />Incredibly fun series of books.

It contains a strong  portrayal of  early 20th century midwestern agricultural life, which Ferber borrowed from  her observations as a young women in Appleton, Wisconsin.<br />_So Big_ is the  story of Dirk DeJong, and his mother Selina. After a colorful and tragic  girlhood, she arrived as a schoolteacher in a Dutch farming community south  of Chicago.  She didn't quite fit in with the narrow-minded farmers and  their overworked wives, yet she married a handsome farmer with notoriously  unproductive land.<br />After his early death, she spends the next decades  finding a market and coaxing a crop to grow in soggy land. By the time Dirk  grows up, the &quot;DeJong asparagus&quot; is a success, and it enables his  banking career.  Yet he loses a sense of empathy and beauty, which Selina  retains, despite her difficult path in life.<br />Ferber is the author who  wrote _Show Boat_ and _Giant_. She could grind out popular dramatic fiction  with loads of stock characters in a sentimentalized historic setting. But  her later work loses the art found in  _So Big_, which is peopled  with  multi-dimensional characters and a story which touches the reader's  heart.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2000-08-25

It is a marvelous and absorbing collection of descriptive writing about the human experience. This is a working class novel set in a time  period when women had no reproductive options and little say in setting the  course of their own lives. These individuals experience poverty, hardship,  illiteracy, bad sanitation and the desperation of unmarried and too-fertile  motherhood, both urban and rural. This is a captivating story about human  survival, the perils of marriage, and finally, friendship. Adult themes  throughout. NOT a children's book.	2000-08-01

Hostile to its subject	This is a disappointing biography of the Second Wave feminist pioneer, Betty Friedan. Its author spends so much time making insulting and belittling remarks about Friedan's behavior, clothing, relationships,  lifestyle, etc., that the reader begins to wonder if it is a deliberate and  underhanded attempt to discredit the feminist leader.  The biographer  apparently spent a great deal of time interviewing all of Friedan's past  acquaintances, trying to cull out unpleasantries and dirty laundry.  Everything negative that happens in Friedan's lifetime is blamed on  personal shortcomings of Friedan.  This is not a credible biography.  Instead, I would suggest reading Friedan's own recent memoir of her life,  _Life So Far_.  Anyone who has read any of Friedan's books (_Feminine  Mystique_, _It Changed My Life_, _Fountain of Age_) and  been impressed  with this great woman's strong voice for women's rights, and her  extraordinarily powerful messages, will have difficulty with the negativity  that mars this second rate book. I really don't understand why a biographer  with so little empathy for her subject spent the time to write this book.  Friedan herself is a marvelous writer, and she is misrepresented and  underrated here.	2000-06-10

The publication of her book, _The Feminine Mystique_ in 1963 catapulted her into international celebrity.  The book  was a catalyst of change. Fueled by an economic boom in which a single  wage-earner could provide a satisfactory standard of living for an entire  family, post World War II women had been pressured to abandon the workplace  in order to bury their identities in housekeeping and motherhood.<br /> Many  middle class women felt stifled by the false feminine ideals and enforced  domesticity of this era, and it was their frustration and anger to which  Friedan's writing resonated. She was an educated Jewish woman with three  children, a journalist,  who had lived the suburban lifestyle, but who was  propelled by her sense of injustice to speak to the larger world.<br />_It  Changed My Life_ is a compilation of old and new writings, interviews,  magazine articles, and recollections ten years after Friedan and a handful  of other women founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) in a  Washington hotel room.  This book was published in 1976, at a time when the  original energy of the &quot;second wave&quot; women's movement had been  submerged in pro-lesbian, anti-family rhetoric, and the futile struggle to  pass the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) had many people questioning whether  feminism was dead.<br />Her exceptional and powerful writings prove Friedan  to be an outspoken radical, a true leader of our times. She is a  spokeswoman for the heterosexual woman who loves her children, but  who  also wants to be valued by the human race. Friedan spoke out against social  and economic powerlessness for women, as well as false standards of  &quot;machismo&quot; for men. Her goal was cooperation, not  separatism.<br />For instance, here is Friedan's interesting definition of  feminism:<br />&quot;My definition of feminism is simply that women are  people, in the fullest sense of the word, who must be free to move in  society with all the privileges and opportunities and responsibilities that  are their human and American right. This does not mean class warfare  against men, nor does it mean the elimination of children, which denies our  human future.<br />&quot;It seems to me that _all_ the women's movement ever  was, or needs to be, is a stage in the whole human rights movement -  bringing another group, a majority this time, into the mainstream of human  society, with all the perils and promises and human risks this involves. No  more, no less. &quot; (p. 317, paperback)<br />Some of the most compelling  writing in this book comes from a column originally published in _McCall's_  magazine between 1970-73. &quot;Betty Friedan's Notebook&quot; is a  readable,  page-turning narrative of Friedan's travels around the globe to  spread the world of the women's movement.  She was a busy speaker, much in  demand, a dynamic personality in the lecture hall. The accounts of  the  public's response to her message in places like Brazil and Italy is  absolutely absorbing. And we get to see the &quot;at home&quot; side of  Betty as well, as she integrates her experiences as a woman and mother into  her public vision for change.<br />In conclusion, _It Changed My Life_ is an  optimistic collection of journalistic writings calling for real dialogue  between the sexes. Betty Friedan is a pivotal figure in the history of the  Women's Movement in America, and her exceptional ideas merit consideration  by anyone interested in women's issues.

Catherine was a childless, unmarried, middle-class woman, whose  great tragedy was that her fiance was lost at sea before they were  married.<br />She was an intellectual who lived in a time when women were  severely constrained by domestic drudgery. Catherine Beecher strived to  ennoble women's traditional role through education:<br />&quot;It is the aim  of this volume to elevate both the honor and the remuneration of all  employments that sustain the many difficult and varied duties of the family  state, and thus to render each department of woman's profession as much  desired and respected as are the most honored professions of  men.&quot;<br />There is a great deal of moralizing in this book, about  lifestyle, Christian charity, care of children and servants, and so forth.  In this, Catharine Beecher was a product of her century. Yet some of the  observations are surprisingly astute, even for today's readers. For  instance, there is a humorous passage about cooking with butter that will  have you smiling about rancid butter in every dish. In so many ways, the  modern homemaker has less to worry about. We can purchase conveniences that  were undreamt of 130 years ago.<br />This is a self-consciously  &quot;American&quot; perspective on keeping a middle class house.  Yet the  French are looked to as having perfected cooking and many other things, and  this sort of repetitious praise can grate on the American reader. Beecher  was addressing the American woman during the Civil War and post-Abolition  time period, during a great influx of European immigrants and  when the  population was actively expanding westward. She had it in mind to influence  the young woman of a certain generation, and in many ways, her ideas were  both more advanced and more orderly than what had gone before.<br />This book  is a *must read* for students of Women's History as it pertains to women in  the home. If you are interested in the 19th century lifestyle, you will  find many domestic details here.read* for students of Women's History as it pertains to women in  the home.

You will appreciate the commentary  here if you are interested in women's history and the status of women in  the family, not to mention the much-maligned field of home economics. Yes,  there is an international perspective, but this makes the book *more*, not  less credible.<br />Gives an interesting history of the development of the  &quot;germ&quot; theory and how manufacturers of cleaning products, both  now and in the past, use(d) pseudo-scientific claims to convince women to  buy newer and  even more products. Asks whether time-saving products, such  as vacuum cleaners and washing machines, actually INcreased the amount of  time spent cleaning by raising expectations. Talks about flies, filth,  public sanitation, and real health issues as they relate to household  hygiene. Also a chapter about gender and the role of men in contributing  (or not) to domestic tasks.<br />Lots of cutting commentary about  commercially-motivated home economists, such as Martha Stewart and her  predecessors. Plus a chapter about &quot;clean freaks&quot; and  obsessive-compulsive behavior as it relates to housecleaning. All in all, a  highly engaging book which offers a great deal of insight to any reader  interested in women's issues or domestic history.	2000-05-17

Chapter six  concentrates upon the after-effect of female sterilization on a woman's physical and  mental health, sex life, and marital relationship, based on studies which  predate the recent CDC study (of thousands of women, over many years). Not  dry reading, but includes some short case studies. It is funny how even the  framing of the particular questions can reflect the status of women at the  time. And it took 5 or 6 children before a woman was considered by common  medical authority to have fulfilled her duty as a mother. The notion that  women might want to chart their own reproductive destiny is overlooked or  mentioned apologetically in this selection of essays.  I think we have  advanced a great deal towards the ideal of informed consent since the  1970s. Will make great reading for those interested in the history of  reproductive medicine, as it relates to women's health, especially the  topic of voluntary surgical sterilization.	2000-05-09

The photos of little children are  very good and enjoyable to look at. It is a multicultural picture book and  the parents are also shown as being caring and loving. While it is not the  miracle cure for a resistant child, this book is enjoyable to read and I  would recommend it to any parent.	1999-12-09
