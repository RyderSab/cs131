And Europe is the Faith.  Writing in early twentieth century England, with Europe the center of civilized consciousness, his thesis certainly rang true.  Nearly a century later, his work and its theme still have profound relevance.  For it is likely only a return to the Faith that can now save us.<br /><br />Reading Belloc is a joy, whether you agree with him, or not.  His writing reflects a scientist's precision, a philospher's discernment, a kindly friend's good humor, and an artist's awesome talent.<br /><br />There is perhaps not a better overview of the history of European and Western Civilization extant than Belloc's \\"Europe and the Faith\\".  Its truths are timeless.  And its presentation is savory.  But a certain caution is required.  Reading Belloc can be addictive.  However, as addictions go, \\"Old Thunder\\" is a good one.  Read Belloc, and be prepared for a wondrous ride.  For the Faith is Europe; and Europe is the Faith.	2005-09-12

Certainly, it is the clarion call of a Catholic against the dangers of freemasonry in American society.  But that is no reason to condemn the book.  Rather, understanding the perspective of the author helps us to appreciate more fully what is reflected in the corpus of the work.<br /><br />And there much in the body of this work that is extremely important and revelatory.  For instance, Mr. Fisher shares startling, sensational, and well founded examples of many of America's leaders who were both freemasons and prominent members of the insidious Ku Klux Klan.  When the author delves into the influence of secret societies on American history, the work is absolutely great and powerfully important.  A small criticism is that, in this reviewer's opinion, too much space is devoted to the supreme court and its penetration by the aforementioned freemasons and Klansmen.  This notwithstanding, the book is, in the whole, important and well recommended.  May the Lord richly bless the author, his publisher, and any future readers.	2005-09-03

He follows this startling premise with a really worthwhile, though not comprehensive, rendition of conspiratorial history.  This part of well written, but is missing much that is extremely relevant to the overall issue.  Still then concludes, returning the original sensational premise, and relating, inexplicably, that it may or may not have been true.  Despite this serious flaw, the book is generally well written and useful.	2005-09-02

When one undertakes seriously to study history, it is inevitable that they come to deal with philosophy.  And any serious comtemplation of philosophy has ultimately to deal with the Catholic Church.  Herein, Father Amorth relates the electrifying story of his years as an exorcist in the ultimate form of philososphical warfare, that of God and Satan.<br /><br />The book is well written.  It is a \\"page turner\\".  Once you pick it up, you will be hard pressed to set it down.  And the central message of salvation through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, is without doubt the most important message for human beings to grasp.

Long had I considered ordering and reading it and long had I avoided so doing.  It seemed to me that there was so much emphasis on the United Nations, an organization which seems to be more irrevelant as time goes on, as to make the whole less than worthy of the time necessary to read a book of such length.  Finally, I was moved to order, if only because it is a title also carried by \\"Catholic Treasures\\", a largely undiscovered source of awesome wisdom and truth.<br /><br />But, now to particulars of the book.  It is extraordinarily well documented and very well written.  This book is as remarkable for what it includes that others of the genre do not as for what it omits that others include.  For instance, Flynn relates that Margaret Sanger, a founder of the Planned Parenthood movement, was sympathetic with Nazi eugenics and once sought the enforced sterilization of \\"black, hispanics, American Indians, Catholics, and other undesirables\\".  There are many more fascinating examples.  On the other side of the ledger, Flynn leaves out of his discourse much of any mention of the critical aspects of Middle East history that others emphasize.  Also, much of Flynn's corpus focuses on the wacky Clinton administration, all of which is interesting, but not that relevant just now.  In writing this, I am mindful that Clinton style socialism could again become crucial consideration come 2008.  Oh, Lord, please spare us what seems to be coming way.<br /><br />The book is a bit too long.  Flynn quotes some folks at great length when a simple summation of their position would have sufficed.<br /><br />Still and all, this is an excellent book and well worth the time and money.  May the Lord richly bless the author, his publisher, and all who are edified by this work.	2005-08-21

Writing in the period between the World Wars, the author undertakes a task no less than describing the history of secret societies and subversive movements from the very beginnings of the Christian era up to her present early twentieth century times.  Having accomplished this is an amazing manner, she then proposes to describe the factors and forces at the helm of the world revolutionary conspiracy.  To Nesta Webster, writing in the aforementioned time and context, these were as follows:<br /><br />Grand Orient Freemasonry<br />Theosophism<br />Pan-Germanism<br />International Finance<br />World Jewry<br /><br />This list is fascinating and does provide an interesting insight into the mind of this author.  Nesta Webster always distinguishes between Grand Lodge and Grand Orient Freemasonry, the former, which she deems admirable, and the latter, insidious.  Writing between the wars, as a patriotic Britisher, she did not foresee the later alliance of Theosophy and pan-Germanism against Grand Orient Freemasonry and World Jewry, with International Finance conveniently \\"playing both ends against the middle\\", that was the essential conflict of the second great war.  Her blind spot for the intrigues of British Freemasonry and Zionism tarnishes her work, but are, at least, understandable in context.<br /><br />In summary, this is an excellent and important work that must be taken in context.  For any who would understand the conspiratorial aspect of history, this book is highly recommended.	2005-07-23

The book is an inclusive and well written account of the influence of our Lord and Savior on American history.  Although I am priviliged to be degreed in history, it was in this excellent and important book that I really came to understand the important notion of subsidiarity.  This concept holds as follows:<br /><br />One of the key principles of Catholic social thought is known as the principle of subsidiarity. This tenet argues that nothing should be done by a larger and more complex organization which can be done as well by a smaller and simpler organization. In other words, any activity which can be performed by a more decentralized entity should be. This principle is a bulwark of limited government and personal freedom. It conflicts with the passion for centralization and bureaucracy characteristic of the Welfare State.<br /><br />Would that our legislative, executive, and judicial servants understood this important concept!  Perhaps one day they will.  Bravo once again to Mrs. Carroll!	2005-07-19

Fahey postures with wonder and a proper sense of grace the importance of the Church triumphant as the foundation of Western Civilization and as the ultimate hope of this fallen world.  He contrasts Jewish naturalism, through the articulation of the Talmud and the Kabbalah, with the Word of Jesus Christ, as the essential and, as yet unresolved, conflict of the ages.  This is a truly great and important book!<br /><br />Addendum:  21-Feb-07<br /><br />Just this week, I have had the opporunity to reread this very important book.  Now, it is important to keep in mind that I did so after a year of study of philosophia perennis, promulgated by the Saint Augustine Institute of Catholic Studies.  This foundation has given me an even greater appreciation for the awesome wisdom contained in this terribly important volume.<br /><br />Father Fahey was an expert in both Church History and Scholastic Philosophy.  And, having now a foundation at least in the latter, his syllogistic reasoning is ever so much more penetrating and insightful than it is for one not previously so informed.  This is truly a book that becomes more efficacious with the skill and knowledge of its reader.  Read this very important book.  Reflect on it in light of the essential ontological truths of life.

In his rendering, Belloc consciously errs on the side of being charitable to the subject of the controversy.  Although in so doing, he very nearly at times departs from his usual scrupulous integrity, he nevertheless accomplished what few others have, that being a truly unbiased rendering of the question and its potential solutions.  If nothing else, the book is to be treasured simply for the pleasure of reviewing Belloc's fluid prose.  But more than that, we can herein read the wonder of a kind spirit imbued with an awesome talent writing about a subject that concerns us all.  Sadly, Belloc, writing in the 1920's did not then propose a solution that was to be embraced by the political leadership of his day.  Even more sad is the ultimate realization of that which Belloc then prophesied, that the English supported Zionist adventure in Palestine was doomed to abject failure.  The foregoing notwithstanding, the work is excellent and highly recommended for any who would enjoy a truly unbiased and insightful discussion of this, one of the great issues of our age.	2005-07-02

This is a beautifully written and fascinating account of the twenty-three main protagonists of Reformation Europe, from Henry VIII to Louis XIV.  Belloc includes incredible detail around the lives and times of such as William Cecil and his dwarfish son, Robert, the true rulers of Elizabethan England.  This book further expands on Belloc's theory, first put forth in \\"How the Reformation Happened\\", that the Reformation was really a rising of the rich against the poor.  Belloc provides startling revelations relative to the looting of Church properties in Reformation England that led its looters to becoming the new landed gentry, who then ran the Parliament and ultimately usurped the throne of England with the elevation of William III, of Orange.  This work is outstanding and essential.  I recommend reading Belloc's \\"How the Reformation Happened\\" first and then reading this great book.<br /><br />To read Belloc is to have the feeling of listening to a remarkably wise and talented story teller, who has the patience and grace to speak to you from his heart relative to matters about which you should care deeply.  Before reading Belloc, I do not think I truly understood European history.  Thanks to his wonderful work, I feel as if I am beginning to discern the great truths of this all important saga of human history.	2005-04-03

Long have I searched for an excellent and readable overview of the history of Western Civilization.  In Belloc's tremendous work, I have found it.  This is doubtless the greatest and most important broad overview of the Western Civilization I have ever encountered.  Belloc herein argures that Christianity changed the foundation of the Graeco-Roman Empire from slavery to Faith.  He further postulates that the Reformation was a terrible catastrophe in its resultant disintegration of unified Christendom.  Belloc argues that Judeo-masonic communism and Judeo-protestant capitalism are the forces that undermine the future of civilization.  This work is awesome, prophetic, and uniquely insightful.  It is also tremedously well written.  Indeed, reading Belloc is like having a conversation with a learned and wise old friend.  You savor each word, and don't want the converstation to end.  This is a great book!<br /><br />Addendum 03-Apr-06<br /><br />I have had occassion this past weekend to reread this very important book.  In the interim, I had read on the order of twenty of Belloc's other titles, the four volumes extant of Warren Carroll's history of Christendom, several of William Thomas Walsh's great works, and a smattering of Dennis Fahey, Nesta Webster, and Gordon Craig Alexander, among others.  What the latter intensive reading has demonstrated is the amazing wisdom contained in this short, but terribly imporant book.<br /><br />Belloc completed this book in the late 1930's, near the conclusion of his amazing literary career.  He then wrote at a time when FDR's New Deal Socialism controlled the United States, Hitler's national socialism directed Germany, which Belloc still called Prussia, and Stalin's scientific socialism ran the Soviet Union.  What the programs of all three despots had in common, of course, was socialism.  And it was this evil in all of its various disguises that Belloc here inveighed against.  Of course, a greater crisis soon ensured, the tragedy of World War II, ended by the unspeakable horror of nuclear immolation of Japan's most Catholic city, Nagasaki.  Yet the words of Belloc still ring true, even in this dawning decade of the 21st century.  Without a societal return to the Faith, we are certainly doomed to serfdom, and possibly much worse.  Read this wonderful and beautifully written masterpiece, and be well informed and richly blessed by the process.

In this wondrously readable text, Belloc provides a terrific expose' of the course of events and factors behind what he calls the shipwreck of European Civilization, the Protestant Reformation.  Belloc herein aruges persuasively that it was Ann Boelyn, through her insistence on becoming Queen, rather than mistress to Henry VIII, who was the pivot of the English Reformation, without which Western Civilization would have remained predominately Catholic.  He further illustrates the aristocratic nature of the Huguenot uprising in France and the insidious and powerful nature of Calvin's writings.  Belloc further illuminates the influence of the wealthy merchants and money traders in the splitting of Protestant Holland and Catholic Belgium.  Finally, Belloc elucidates how Richilieu's French nationalism got the best of his Catholicism in his action of arraying the great warrior King Gustav Adolphus of Sweden against the Hapsburg forces in support of what emerged as Protestant Northern Germany and, ultimately, Prussia.  This is truly a magnificent work and critically important to the understanding of the saga of Western Civilization.	2005-04-03

On reading her work, I now understand why.  Her writing is simply excellent.  And her scholarship is outstanding.  Herein, Mrs. Webster has left us with a beautiful and compelling account of the revolutionary movement from the French Revolution to the Bolshevik, the Chinese, the Indochinese, and the African.  According to her excellent account, there is a guiding thread throughout all of this revolutionary activity, illuminated freemasonry.  And the author certainly makes a solid case for this, skillfully tying together the writings of Weishaupt with the pronouncements of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion and the actions of the Soviet state.<br /><br />However, the work has two flaws, which may in fact be related.  Mrs. Webster inveighs against Continental freemasonry, but honors Anglo Saxon freemasonry.  She also portrays communism as a monstrous evil, but leaves the evil of zionism totally unaddressed.  As it seems that Continental freemasonry is most closely affiliated with the communism movement and Anglo Saxon freemasonry with zionism, it may be that these errors are both intentional and related.  In any case, this is an outstanding book, which this reviewer highly recommends.	2005-02-24

I had purchased it after having seen it advertised in \\"The Barnes Review\\", a publication I had previously known to be thoughtful and scholarly.  My opinion has now been altered by this experience.  The writing of this book is so poor that it is difficult to discern in many cases the intent of large portions of the narrative.  It certainly does not represent what I had hoped for, a well researched and thoughtfully presented rendering of medieval European history.  The only thing useful in this book is the standalone chronology, which can be found at the end of the book.  Dates are important in the study of history.  But excellent writing skills are equally important for the communication of the great ideas and movements of history.  And the writing herein is truly terrible.  If you are searching for an excellent book on the topic of medieval Europe, I urge you to look elsewhere.  Knowing what I know now, I would not have wasted hard earned money on this book.<br /><br />Addendum 07-Apr-05:<br /><br />For any who are interested in this topic of a generalized history of Western Civilization, I can heartily recommend Hilaire Belloc's \\"Crisis of Civilization\\", which is also available from Amazon.

David Duke has herein rendered something very important in reporting conclusively and with significant serious scholarship on the question of Jewish Supremacism.  This is a subject area that is very nearly taboo in the mainstream of literary discourse these days.  And for venturing forth into this territory without apparent trepidation, Mr. Duke rightly deserves our applause.  As Douglas Reed so insightfully observed years ago, to go down this path is to incur lese majesty and to commit heresy against the new American faith of \\"holocaustianity\\", whose liturgy has replaced Calvary with Auschwitz as the central ontological truth of our time.  So, why do we rate the work almost great and not peerless?  Sadly, Mr. Duke falls into the trap of zionist ideology as first articulated by Moses Hess.  For in criticism of zionism and Jewish supremacy, he offers up white European obsessions as an alternative.  This is a tragic error which seriously mars this otherwise excellent and important work.  Michael Hoffman has captured this error with his usual awesome insight and wisdom in saying,<br /><br />\\"Racial obsessions obscure spiritual realities:  anyone of any race who at any time subscribes to the mental contagion of the Pharisees and persists in the way of the Pharisees is \\"under wrath\\"(I Thessalonians 2:16).  Such wrath is not racially determined.\\"<br /><br />With this truth in mind, we realize that promotion of white European, or Aryan, separatism, is every bit as insidious as Jewish supremacy.  It is but the other side of the same counterfeit coin.  In summary, we can honor the significant work rendered here by Mr. Duke.  But we do so with qualification.  For, in love of Christ, we must know justice and know mercy while yet there is time.	2005-02-01

The man is a scholar, a soldier, and, clearly, a devoted Christian.  In his magnificient work, Beaty exposes the long term enmity of the Khazar people for the Russians, its impact and resolution in the Bolshevik Revolution, and the influence of these same Khazars on American foreign policy within the Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman administrations.  Further, Beaty elucidates the motives behind the crazy hodge podge of Truman administration foreign policy in the post World War II period and prophetically analyzes the roles of MacArthur and Eisenhower.  Keep in mind that this book was written in advance of the 1952 election season, which saw the elite come to support Eisenhower in order to prevent the election of MacArthur and Taft.<br /><br />In the corpus of this excellent manuscript, Beaty does make the following observation.  In 1940, the World Almanac listed the world Jewish population at 15,319,359.  The same publication in 1949 listed the world Jewish population at 15,713,638.  As six million were alleged to have died during the \\"Holocaust\\", the reader is invited to reach their own conclusion.<br /><br />Beaty writes with the passion of a soldier and a compassionate leader of men in desribing the Korean conflict, its sabatoge by the Truman administration, and the terrible toll this subterfuge represented.  In this, today, one is, of necessity, reminded of the ongoing tragedy in Iraq.<br /><br />This is an excellent and terribly important book.

We all have our perspectives, which necessarily color our presentations.  And Wurmbrand's is that of a man raised as a Jew who converted to Christianity later in life.  In this, he shares a certain similarity with many whose conversion may seem to be something rather less than complete.  This factor manifests itself in his quite interesting treatment of Moses Hess, whom the author credits with planting the seeds of both communism and what he describes as an ungodly form of zionism.  To this, the authentic Christian must ask, \\"Is there a godly form of zionism?\\"  The answer is, of course, no!<br /><br />This notwithstanding, Wurmbrand's book is interesting, important, and insightful.  We only wish that it could have been a bit more candid with regard to his depiction of Hess, who argued that both the race and the class struggles would be dispositive of mankind's future.  Hess saw the race struggle manifested in zionism and the class struggle in communism.  In any case, Wurmbrand perceived Marx as a tortured and spiritually conflicted man, who has done ever so much more harm than good.  And to his everlasting credit, Wurmbrand quite correctly holds that the future hope for this fallen world is embodied in the love of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.  Give this book a read with an open heart and an open mind and be enriched.	2004-12-12

In order to understand the foreign policy of the Bush administration, this excellent book is an absolute essential.  Herein, crusading author Michael Collins Piper accurately describes the rise of the nefarious neoconservatives and their clandestine control of the Bush White House.  Who are they?  They are committed Trotskyites such as Norman Podhoretz, his son, John, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Irving and William Kristol, Robert Kagan, and many others.  What do they seek?  The primary objective seems to the primacy of Israel in the Middle East.  Ultimately, the plan seems to be for a nominally American, but truly Trotskyite, world empire.  In this important, though albeit short book, lies the sinister plan for at least next four years.  Read this important book carefully.  Then hope and pray that the machinations of the evil plotters herein depicted can be derailed.	2004-11-24

It is proclaimed to be the hidden history of Western Civilization.  As I am degreed in history and treat the study of history now as a serious undertaking, I was intrigued.  In addition, the positive reviews led me to think this would be an imporant contribution to my overall research.  I was sadly disappointed.<br /><br />From the beginning of the narrative, I knew I was in trouble.  In a broad sweep, the author attributes the \\"liberalism\\" of the French Revoluiton to the triumph of the Enlightenment.  To this, I would say that the author really needs to read some history.  The French Revolution was one of the most terrible epochs in history.  If there is a similar movement, it would be the Bolshevik Revolution, which some have insightfully postured, was engendered by the same forces.<br /><br />What Livingstone has rendered here is not history in any sense.  Rather it is a loose conglomeration of myth and legend, with little analysis and virtually no synthesis.  The book is terribly disappointing, as any sort of guide to understanding the history of Western Civilization.  I am very suspicious of its favorable reviews.  The writing is poor, the documentation scant, and the conclusions faulty.

Although, while reading it, I couldn't help but feel I was reviewing a National Geographic article on some primitive tribe on the Amazon, not the great online bookseller, the river.  Such was Gorenberg's rendering of the madness of the fundamentalists.  Gorenberg is, first and foremost, a journalist; and his style is, naturally, journalistic.  It makes for lively and interesting reading, but there is really little analysis and virtually no synthesis in the overall presentation.<br /><br />One of the more interesting and important aspects that Gorenberg does develop well is the odd alliance of America's Christian Zionist movement with the Israeli religious right.  Why is this alliance odd?  Well, understanding of classic Christianity reveals that it is fundamentally at odds with Judaism, which is not a Biblical faith at all, but rather allegiance to the Talmudic Pharisees, the Kabbalah, and the Babylonian Talmud.  This aspect is dramatically exposed in the support of misguided \\"Christian\\" zealots, such as Irvin Baxter, who support the terrorist founded and oriented Temple Mount Faithful movement of Gershom Solomon.  Solomon's predecessor was, of course, Stanley Goldfoot, who was responsible for the King David Hotel terrorist bombing and the assassination of Count Bernadotte.  Baxter supports said terrorist organization by influencing his misled radio and \\"ministry\\" followers to send money to various causes that further the insidious work of the terrorist \\"faithful\\".  It is interesting to note, as Gorenberg insightfully observes, that Baxter has made rather a career of exciting his sleep walking followers to anticipate the imminent \\"End of Days\\" all the while sending emergency funds to his \\"ministry\\", such that news of the end can be promulgated with dispatch.  If such reasoning appeals to you, perhaps you will really enjoy Gorenberg's book and Baxter's rather silly radio show.<br /><br />Gorenberg ends his book by reciting a rabbinic story relative to the murder of Abel by his brother, Cain.  This is a fitting end to his book, as it leaves to Talmudic jurisprudence and dialectic the guilt or innocense of Cain.  In the end, it is not the Word of God that matters to such as Gorenberg and Baxter. It is the guile of the rabbis.  The book ends not with a bang, but with a whimper.iting a rabbinic story relative to the murder of Abel by his brother, Cain.

It is scholarly, well documented, and extraordinarily well written.  That some folks want to discourage the reading of this important book by calling it anti-Semitic is ample proof that it strikes close to home with respect to revealing the basis of the insanity of the zionist movement.  The reality is that the author presents the truth of the matter.  And as he so insightfully observes, the truth can not be &quot;anti-anything&quot;.  It is the truth that will set us free.

Shortly thereafter, newly elected President Reagan was shot by John Hinkley, an event which nearly gave Skull and Bones initiate George H.W. Bush his presidency eight years ahead of schedule.  Does anyone remember the name of the main character of \\"Greatest American Hero\\"?  Yes, it was Hinkley.<br /><br />The show was silly. But the assassination attempt was dead serious.  And Michael Hoffman describes herein how the elite have been laughing at the unitiated for years with little tricks such as these.  This is truly an amazing book.  It is the most complete philosophical treatment of the elite conspiracy that I have read to date.  As another reviewer suggested, it is not for beginners.  The writing is excellent.  The facts are overpowering.  And the overall message is desperately important.  Inform yourself so that you can know justice and love mercy while yet there is time.  This is a great book!<br /><br />Addendum; 29-Dec-13:<br /><br />Those who have read and been edified by Mr. Hoffman's excellent books should be aware that he has lately produced a magazine size edition of his newsletter that deals with the assassination of JFK, the assassination being surely one of the turning points of modern American history.  I have read Hoffman's newsletter #69 now several times and have learned more with each reading.  I would encourage others who have enjoyed and learned from Hoffman's work to pick up a copy of this newsletter.  Also, we should endeavor to encourage Hoffman to continue his work on the sequel to \\"Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare\\", which is tentatively entitled \\"Twilight Language\\".

The book provided that.  But it was also interesting, if only as a presentation of some important history told from a very unique perspective.  As to style, I was pleasantly surprised.  It reads almost like a novel in some cases.  But that probably goes to the validity of things as well.  In assessing that aspect, I am reminded of the line from the movie, \\"Next of Kin\\",<br />\\"Joey likes to brag.  I wanna hear him brag.\\"<br />There is a lot of that here.  As others have pointed out, the book probably exaggerates Giancana's influence over the world at large and some key events, such as the assassinations of the Kennedys and Monroe.  But, having said that, it is overall a good and enjoyable read.<br />Addendum 02-Apr-04:<br />Toward the end of this book, the claim is made, in rather dramatic fashion, that Sam Giancana slept with Marilyn Monroe on the last weekend of her life at the Cal-Neva lodge in Lake Tahoe.  Somehow, this just didn't \\"ring true\\" to me.  I have done a bit more research and learned that Marilyn was with Joe Dimaggio that weekend, whom she planned to remarry within the month.  I seriously doubt she bedded Giancana while enjoying the weekend getaway with her betrothed.  This also goes to the overall veracity of the entertaining account.	2004-03-08

This is a connection left out, rather mysteriously, by many JFK researchers.  The fact that this book is hard to find and has been suppressed by the ADL is reason enough to put it at the top of your reading list in order to understand what really happened on the darkest day of American history.  I finished the book satisfied that Piper had done much to unravel more of the mystery in to who had killed JFK and, most importantly, why.  So, why do I only give the book four stars and not five?  One could make the case that, by focusing so specifically on the Israeli connection, which is important, Piper may have missed the much more important masonic, Illuminati connection.  That notwithstanding, this is important and enlightening information, that should be in the library of any serious student of the Kennedy assassination.  Know the truth.

This book is as astonishing for what it does not say as for what it does.  It does not explain how some misguided souls have ordered their lives around the mythology recorded in tomes such as this.  What it does say is that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross and that He, in fact, was the father of children with Mary Magdelene.  The offspring of this union ostensibly spawned the Merovingian line of European royalty, whose descendents are still with us today.<br />Much of this nonsense has to with the conspiracy of the Priory of Sion.  The conspirators behind the Priory of Sion had much to do with the creation of Rosicrucianism and English freemasonry.  Gardner attributes most of the world's scientific achievements to this group of wealthy and privileged fanatics.  It's more likely that they are responsible for much of world's suffering through their conspirational machinations throughout the years.  While not particularly well written or documented, the book is at least worth while as a look into the philosophy of some truly disturbed and sadly influential individuals.	2004-02-14

Icke is certainly \\"out there\\" in terms of his overall theory of the sad state of our world.

He goes to further to argue that the Illuminati are controlled by an inter-dimensional race of reptilian demonic characters.  Icke pounds away at orthodox versions of history and religion and does so in an extraordinarily convincing and entertaining manner.  To me, what's most important is his final thesis.  It is that, in the end, love is the most powerful force in the Universe.  I have known this instinctively for a long and have written about this myself in my own first novel, \\"Swan Haven\\".

Icke's writing style is engaging, and the material is fascinating.  To me, the troubling aspect was that some of the facts were clearly in error; and some of the conclusions, particularly those about Christianity, were ill founded.  But, I was hugely entertained and informed.  By the book's end, I found I had much more in common spiritually with the author than I would have previously imagined.<br />Icke covers some extremely important historical and political aspects of the human condition.  He does this from a very unique perspective.  My experience in reading this book is that if you are able to hang with the narrative and suspend your disbelief through a fascinating ride through the pages, you will come out at the end with greater understanding of this world.  What higher compliment can we pay a book of this nature?<br />And here's a little secret, folks.  Somewhere within Icke's unqique philosphy of the world, there is a strong Christian tradition.  Witness the title of this book.  And the truth shall set you free.  This is an almost direct quote of John 8:32.  &quot;And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&quot;  In his final chapter, Icke reflects upon the negative behaviors and energy of those who have run this world quite badly.  He sums this up with the conclusion to forgive them, for they know not what they do.  Again, Look at Luke 23:24; and you will find virtually the same words and certainly the same thought process.<br />I encourage everyone to read this important and entertaining book with an open heart and open mind.  This will, indeed, set you free.  God bless.	2003-06-03

We all remember what we were doing when we found out about the tragic events of 911.  In this way, it was similar to the assassination of JFK.  Icke argues herein that there was another similarity between these two black days in American history, that both tragedies were, in fact, the result of plots hatched by the power elite to gain greater control over the common people.  The case made is convincing.  Icke's writing style is engaging.  This is a book you may have trouble putting down, once you have started it.  Throughout the book, Icke alludes to his overall theory of the state of our world.  Then the final chapter provides an overview of this startling theory.  While some may have trouble embracing this theory, the rest of the book is extraordinarily worthwhile in its careful exposition of the mountain of lies surrounding the official story of 911.

Understand that it is an undertaking.  The book in hardcover form is over 1300 pages.  The detail is, as a previous reviewer suggests, difficult to find elsewhere.  From this perspective, the book is hugely important.  Professor Quigley also advances some compelling explantions for history that still resonate today, such as the existence of the Pakistan-Peruvian Axis, which has promulgated the cancer of Islamic culture throughout the world.<br />However, it is certainly true that Quigley's massive undertaking is flawed with his obvious misunderstanding of macroeconmics.  His prescription for Keynsian planning and the heralding of the success of planned economies relative to lassez faire economies has probably influenced much of the thinking of America's elite for decades.  Will those elites finally wake up to the reality that socialism doesn't work?  Or, do they understand that socialism does work well, so long as you're in charge of the socialist government.  The next century will be the story of how these questions are answered by history.<br />The book is excellent and well worth the time and effort.  I wish Professor Quigley was still around to comment on how things have changed since this work was completed.	2003-01-05

The movie was generally faithful to the novel, with just a bit of Hollywood added.  The story follows draftee Stephen Courcey through special forces training and finally into the jungle of the Central Highlands of the Republic of South Vietnam.  There, the experience of his military advisory team seems to be an allegory to the American involvement in Vietnam.  One of the characters, a number crunching junior officer, allows that it will take 50,000 American combat deaths to \\"stabilize\\" the situation in Southeast Asia.  This statement in this work of fiction written in 1967 is pretty amazing when you consider that the final American death count in Vietnam was 58,000 and change.<br />The novel moves quickly and flows nicely.  The characters are strong.  You find yourself somehow inside Corporal Courcey's head and laughing at Captain Olivetti's obsession with his CIB, his combat infantry badge.  The role of Major Barker in the book is much less central than it is in the movie.  But then, Burt Lancaster played the ... out of Major Barker in the film, so they may have made certain adjustments for the star.<br />There is a sadness and fatalism about the book that may bother some.  However, the topic is not exactly uplifting.  On the whole, a worthwhile and enjoyable read.	2002-08-05

Scott Peck takes on an extremely important subject: developing a psychology of evil. Much of this is ground breaking, instructive, and tremendously important. However, his analysis is flawed by perceptible weaknesses. Peck shares early on that his is a Christian world view and that it is with this world view that he perceives his clinical world. Then he utterly betrays this world view, as he describes his own consumption of alcohol and his serious contemplation of an adulterous affair with a female patient. Further, he describes, or rather, hints at, the events surrounding two exorcisms. My suspicion is that if he was indeed involved in an exorcism and truly encountered Satan, he probably was found out in the worst imaginable way. This is to say that many folks who claim liberal Christian theology, including ordained clergy, are not truly indwelt with the Spirit of the Living God. It seems pretty clear from Peck's writing that he has been half stepping his way through theological issues. If my suspicions are true, I can imagine that the encounter with Satan was, shall we say, most unpleasant. I wouldn't want to write about it explicitly either, unless I was wise enough to change my ways as a result of the learning experience. And I further suspect from Peck's writings that he's probably too egotistical to admit this. The narrative is also terribly weak in the area of his description of the My Lai incident. A child of wealthy East Coast parents who saw Army duty as a doctor, Peck seems to have assimilated the self righteous attitude of the East Coast establishment with respect to the rank and file of the rest of America. This attitude is as offensive to Americans of humble beginnings as it is ridiculous. Following this, Mr. Peck treats us to his ultimate view of a Fabian socialist utopia. Again, this an easy world view to support from a mansion in the posh East Coast. It is much less easy to support from America's heartland. Having said all that, the book does have good information.

The highly critical review of this important book by our cousin to the desolate North is indicative of the bankrupt, socialist educational system in that backwater provence of the Old British empire.<br />For all others not so inhibited by Fabian indoctrination, this is an enjoyable and credible read and an excellent starting point to endeavor to understand the conspirational theory of history.  This theory holds, simply, that things don't happen by accident.  How does one explain the Vietnam War?  Only understanding it from the perspective of deliberate mismangement does it make sense.  How does one explain the assassination of JFK and the truly absurd \\"magic bullet\\" theory?  It only makes sense when viewed as a conspiracy hatched and abetted by those who profited from the demise of this dynamic young world leader.  How does one explain Watergate, the elevation of Nelson Rockefeller to the Vice presidency, and the subsequent attempts to eliminate President Ford?  Again, we must look to the unseen hand of conspirators to understand such things.<br />Although written well in advance of the tragic events of 9/11/01, there are also clues herein to unravel this apparent mystery.

I think Jerry Jenkins is also the creator and writer of the sports comic strip, \\"Gil Thorp\\".  That's what you get here.  Bible prophesy as portrayed in the daily comics.  But you have to admire and wonder at the success of the series.  In the end though, lovers of the art of fiction will have an extremely difficult time hanging with this series.  Moreover, the ontological foundation of this series is based on a fairly recent twist on \\"judeo-christian\\" eschatology that is ahistorical and anti-Scriptural.  In fact, one could make a good case that the writing and the attendant clandestine political program is, in fact, anti-Christ.	2002-07-10

Craig Roberts follows his wonderful success, \\"Kill Zone, A Sniper Looks at Dealey Plaza\\", with this excellent description of many of the covert conspirational activities of our federal government.  Like his above mentioned book, this is a read that you will probably have a hard time putting down after first beginning it.

In it, the great Ayn Rand presents her basic vision of the craft of fiction writing.  The material is apparently gleaned from a lecture series the author gave at her home in the late fifties.  Though dated, the advise is still tremendously useful to anyone who seeks to write better fiction.  I read this book after my first novel was accepted for publication.  After reading each important instruction from Rand, I found myself reviewing my own work and wishing I had made this information part of my subconscious prior to setting about the writing.  I believe that my future work will be much better as a consequence of reading this book.  What greater compliment can we pay?<br />As others have noted, it is hard to read anything from Rand without feeling beat about the head and shoulders with her philosophy and egotism.  In reflecting on her life and work, I have great compassion for the tragedies she endured and great admiration for her determination.  I wish I could have talked to her and somehow helped her out of her militant atheism.  But I seriously doubt if she would have listened to me or changed.  In any case, this is wonderful and important material, which I recommend to anyone who desires to write serious fiction.	2002-07-05

That is to say that the basic game is the same, but the execution couldn't be more radically different. In his magazine, Baxter predicted a nuclear war between China and the US back in 1999. This was to be the sixth trumpet war. Just recently on his radio program, he argued that this sixth trumpet war that was about to kill 2 billion people was, in fact, the India-Pakistan crisis. He seems to keep to looking for the devastation, but it isn't happening for him. I guess he thinks once the radioactive dust settles from the nuclear fallout, more people will buy this rediculous material.<br />Among Baxter's many problems are that he seems to believe that he has been given a special and private revelation relative to the End Times. It doesn't work that way, according to Scripture. Morevoer, Mr. Baxter lacks even an educated laymen's understanding of geo-political realities and relative military capabilities.	2002-07-02

Herein lies the true story of the US Seventh Cavalry fighting the first set piece battle of the American War in Vietnam, as told by the batallion commander, Hal Moore, and reporter Joe Galloway. The scenes of desparate combat will thrill and terrify you. Moore's insight into the strategic implications of this battle within the crazy quilt of the American experience in Vietnam will amaze you. Chances are, the chapter on the impact of the battle on the bereaved widows and orphans of troopers who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the Valley of Death will make you cry.

In the gospel according to Irvin, the order of prophesies in the book of Revelation is immaterial.  He argues that the sixth trumpet war is just about to break with China as the antagonist or, if not that, then India and Pakistan, or, if neither of those, then Islam versus Christianity.  The problem is that the fifth trumpet has not yet sounded.  Nor have the first four or, more importantly, the seven seals.  Nope, Mr. Baxter has his own prophetic vision which, unfortunately, doesn't square with the Word of God.	2002-06-27

For those unfamiliar with this insidious secret society, this is tremendously important information. One could make a good case for masonic involvement in the terror of the French Revolution, the Great Depression, World Wars I & II, and the September 11th terrorist attack, among many other sinister events. Perusal of the other reviews of this excellent book is illustrative. Christians applaud the work as revealing significant truths. Secret society members say it is a pack of lies. Who do you believe? Perhaps the author strikes too close to home for the comfort of those who would plot against Christians in secrecy. The Lord said, \\"The truth shall make you free.\\" There is much important truth in this book. May God bless the author and publisher.	2002-06-21

I purchased this book hoping to learn more about the Bush family dealings with Nazi Germany, the Bay of Pigs, the Kennedy assassination, the Reagan assassination attempt, the Savings & Loan debacle, Iran Contra, and so forth.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be a biased politically driven diatribe, written at the time of the 1992 election, and intended to help to derail George Herbert Walker Bush's failed re-election attempt.  Sadly, it seems that most of the reviewers below were so passionate about their desire to see victories for the democrat party that they failed to notice the weakness of this book.<br />The author unwisely starts the book with a short biography.  He describes himself as having spent much of his life in uniform prior to his seventeenth birthday.  Sorry, Mr. Bowen, military school doesn't count.  It just means you probably had wealthy parents.  Then he shares that his falling out with the Bush clan stems from his arrest and imprisonment for illegal importation of narcotics into the United States.  In my opinion, this puts Mr. Bowen in the sad fraternity of Barry Seal, Terry Reed, and many others who enjoyed the huge financial rewards of flying illegal drugs into our nation and then resented the consequences.<br />As to style, the book is not well written.  Moreover, it is not accurate.  Mr. Bowen compares the first Bush administration to that of Herbert Hoover.  In this comparison, he relates that both administrations were charactarized by bread lines.  Well, I wasn't alive during the Hoover administration.  But the assertion that there were bread lines during the early nineties sounds like the worst of Democratic Socialists of America rhetoric.<br />For those who are interested in the secret history of the United States, I would depend on more credible authors such as Craig Roberts, Anthony Sutton, Jim Maars, and James Perloff.<br />Knowing what I know now, I would not waste money on this book.	2002-05-31

This should be required reading in high schools throughout America.  I make this last comment as the concerned parent of teenagers who are being taught history from a decidely globalist and socialist perspective in our schools, which are paid for with hard earned capitalist dollars.  It is truly a shame.<br />Perloff describes beautifully and with a proper sense of wonder some of the history of John Birch.  Yes, this is the same man for whom the society is named.  If you don't know this story of courage and faith, it alone is well worth the price of the book.  Read.  Learn.  And spread the word.  God bless.	2002-05-22

Please don't let the size of this book deter you from reading it.  As another reviewer observed, it goes fast.  You will probably have some trouble putting it down once you've begun.<br />Griffin covers some immensely important topics, the creation of the federal reserve system, the history of money, the conspirational theory of history, and the future of global socialism toward which we are being propelled in a manner which is enlightening, scholarly, and entertaining.<br />The Bible says, &quot;The truth shall set you free.&quot;  There is great truth within this book.  The main question is if enough public spirited leaders can come together to understand these important truths such that we can know justice and love mercy while yet there is time.<br />As a necessary criticism, I believe what could have been a great book is made less so by the weakness of the overall conslusion.  Certainly things need to change, or we are on the road to serfdom.  But I had hoped that Griffin's awesome scholarship would have come up with a more practicable solution than what is described in the conclusion.  Perhaps this is unfair.  At any rate, I urge all who are rightly concerned with the future of Western civilization to read carefully this excellent book and to draw their own conclusions.	2002-05-20
US	42308572	R29WSER5TJQZTU	0910055793	8747405	Vision Quest: A Wrestling Story	Books	3	1	5	N	Y	Entertaining, but disappointing	Back in the 80's, I saw the excellent movie based on this novel and loved it.  Since then, I had always searched for the book on the theory that the book would be even better than the movie.  Unfortunately, the theory doesn't hold here.<br />I am a wrestler, high school, college, and post collegiate in free style.  Also, I have coached the sport at the club level.  (Somehow, we all have to articulate our perspective when addressing this unique book and story.)  Given my wrestling background, I enjoyed the gritty detail of wrestling practice, sacrifice, and the separateness of the amateur wrestling athlete that is well captured in both the book and the movie.<br />But the book is supposed to be something more than that.  It is supposed about coming of age and the great struggles of the transition between the teenage experience and young adulthood.  This aspect is much better captured in the movie than in the book.  The Louden Swain of the novel is a randy, super intelligent, state championship calibre wrestler who has a live in female sex partner.  Sorry, I can't relate to that. Most of us don't have family situations wherein a new girl shows up in town, is invited to move in with us, and winds up sleeping with us.  And most wrestlers struggle to win every match, have respect for opponents and team mates, and don't think we're about to become doctors up in outer space. Moreover, there is no catharsis in this brief story.  The Louden at the beginning of the book is pretty much the Louden at the end.  The only difference is that he seems to be ready for his big match with Shute.<br />This leads to my biggest objection to the novel.  The action builds toward this big match with the well known rival from a nearby school.  We learn that Louden has to cut weight in order to wrestle Shute and that both Shute and Louden have been to the state tournament in previous years.  But the novel ends with the climatic match about to start.  This is pretty poor technique.  In my view, Terry Davis get stuck in the third period.<br />John Irving's \\"The World According to Garp\\", \\"The 158 pound marriage\\", and \\"The Imaginary Girl Friend\\" are much better wrestling stories, written by a true master.  Terry Davis has not been much heard from since the original publication of \\"Vision Quest\\".  Now, I know why.Terry Davis get stuck in the third period.<br />John Irving's \\"The World According to Garp\\", \\"The 158 pound marriage\\", and \\"The Imaginary Girl Friend\\" are much better wrestling stories, written by a true master.

After reading this book, my perspective on the American political scene has been forever altered.  Now I understand clearly that there is really little difference between the major political parties.  Witness the last Presidential election.  The four ticket leaders, Bush, Cheney, Gore, and Lieberman had one thing in common that most Americans know nothing about and that influences their policies more than anything else.  That one thing is membership in the Council on Foreign Relations.  Once I understood this and continued to read history from a more enlightened and less dogmatic perspective, I came to understand many of the mysteries of world and US history.  For instance, how did the Korean War so quickly develop into a stale mate?  Why was American constrained from wining the war in Vietnam?  How did a small group of disorganized radicals come to topple the government of Russia in 1917 and later become the second leading world power?  Why did the Great Depression of 1929 occur sixteen short years after the Federal Reserve System, supposedly put in place to prevent such a thing, went into being?  These and many more puzzles of our time are revealed in this fascinating book.	2002-05-06

Like the author, I am former military man who sensed something very ominous on my first visit to Dealey Plaza in Dallas.  It felt to me like an ambush site.  Indeed, this is exactly what is was, as vividly depicted in Craig Roberts' excellent book.<br />If you want to understand what really happened on this blackest day of American history, you simply must read this book.  The chances are it will go quickly for you.  I ordered the book through Amazon and found it on my door step on a Saturday evening.  The following morning at 1:30am, I turned the final page of the narrative with the assurance that I finally understood what really happened on November 22, 1963 and, most importantly, why.<br />In particular, I was intrigued that the author was led to investigate the facts through his warrior instincts and that his investigation led far beyond the scope of what he originally thought to be an unsolved murder.  The trail of this investigation leads beyond the Mafia, the CIA, the FBI, the US military, and all of the usual suspects right up to the small group of extraordinarily powerful men who truly control this world.<br />To Craig Roberts, Bravo Zulu!

This research led me to understand the insidious dispensationalist rapture cult theology, of which this series is a major part.  It is led by folks who worship an end times fantasy that is ahistorical, anti-Scriptural, and without foundation.  This mental contagion needs to be exposed for what it is.  The \\"Left Behind\\" series is not an innocuous cartoon character rendering of Bible prophesy.  It is rather a part of a much more sinister political strategy, which is manifested in the aforementioned, unprovoked Iraq invasion, and which could indeed culminate in World War III.  It is critically important that this program is exposed for what it is such that we can know justice and love mercy while yet there is time.	2001-09-17
