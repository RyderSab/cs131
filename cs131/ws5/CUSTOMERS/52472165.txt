She and her partner in self promotion, Keith DeCandido, had a pretty amusing schtick going, so I figured I'd buy both their books.   <br /> <br />Gilman has written a great book here.  I actually didn't like the opening few pages and darn near put it down -- but I was reading it on a plane, so I soldiered on.  I'm glad I did.  Within a few more pages I was hooked, and it really gathered steam as it went.  Wonderfully developed lead characters, with well done romantic subplot (a feature that rarely interests me in a book).  I think what I like best about it is that it offers a fully formed vision of an alternate New York where magic works and demons wander the streets, complete with prejudice, fanaticism, greed, foolishness and all those other human traits.  Promises to be the start of a series, so more good stuff to come.	2004-10-31

This entry into the &quot;mystery&quot; genre is merely okay.  The plotting is solid, and the relatively short book roars along at breakneck pace.  Plenty of violence and dark motivations for a cast of underworld characters makes this a pretty good read.  Lead character, Kurz, is a bitter, violent tough guy.  The tough-guy dialogue strays across the line into plain silly from time to time, and nowhere is the motivation for his assistant, Arlene, to maintain her status as Kurz's door mat ever explained.  All in all, this is a violent little piece of literary fluff from a big hitter.  Not a bad read, but nothing to compare to his major works.	2001-08-07

It's remarkable how many of the fundamental concepts of strength training were well known thirty five years ago.  (Also interesting to note is how clear on the concept Mr. McCallum was regarding the dangers of smoking.  Hard to square this level of knowledge in the late 60s with the current craze to sue cigarette companies for &quot;hiding the truth&quot;)<br />Anyway, there's all sorts of good stuff in here about diet, lifting, aerobic exercise, the whole package.

Texan Billy Bob Holland struggles and often fails to control his capacity for violence.  He goes to visit a friend in Montana, Doc Voss, who similarly battles his urges to settle things with guns and fists.  After Doc nearly kills a biker in a bar fight, three bikers rape his daughter in an apparent act of revenge.  But there are so many awful and violent people populating the town, all with mixed up motives and impulses, that the answers to the book's riddles are far from apparent.  Billy Bob frequently talks to the the ghost of his friend LQ Navarro, whom he shot accidentally during a gun battle with Mexican drug dealers, adding a melancholy personification of his inner battles.  Burke brings a strong literary touch to the tough guy genre.  His books are packed with imagery and his characters are all unique (don't buy into the Robicheaux and Holland are the same character foolishness).  This book is fabulous.  You may find yourself compelled to read it in a single sitting.	2001-06-25

As I've gotten older, and have more responsibilities during the day, it's become really rare for me to stay up past &quot;bedtime&quot; to read a book, but this one kept me up.  The premise -- a drug that allows doctors to induce Near Death Experiences in an experimental setting -- is ambitious, and Willis handles it well.  The early part of the novel, when Dr. Lander and Dr. Wright are interviewing people right after their experiences is down right frightening.  I thought the book was going to turn out to be a horror story rather than sci fi.  But once Dr. Lander volunteers to be a subject herself, the book changes tone and becomes more of a mystery.  The characters are great -- particularly Maisie, a little girl with a heart condition who is at death's door.  And the weaving in of historical information is a lot of fun too.  If I have any complaint, I'd say that I would have been tempted to omit the final chapter, which I think was unnecessary and actually diminished the impact from what it would have been without it.	2001-06-13

It's been many years since he reliably turned out first rate stuff.  For at least the past decade, each new Spenser novel can go either way -- pretty good or pretty bad.  I'd say Spenser is never awful, but it's been a long time since one of his outings was great.  Somehow, I keep coming back to the well anyway.<br />This one teeters toward awful.  The idea of having Spenser gather up a bunch of the bad guys that he has more or less admired in past outings to create a posse is pretty interesting, but it goes nowhere.  Most of the posse are reduced to cardboard cut-out characters with accents.  <br />I would say that the fundamental problem is a lack of effort from Parker.  Spenser novels frequently feel a little short, but this one just doesn't have any substance at all.  There is also a glaring plot problem which is difficult to describe without giving away what little mystery there is in this book.  Let's just say that the motivation for one of the lead characters is inexplicable once the facts come out.<br />Also increasingly painful is the banter between Spenser and Susan.  Actually, Susan is altogether an irritating distraction.  Spenser novels are about violence and a macho code.  No one reading a Spenser novel has the smallest interest in hearing about Susan's shopping trips.<br />If you've been reading Spenser for many years, like me, you'll want to read this and probably will plod through the next one, etc. until Spenser finally goes to the grave.  He's an old friend gone to seed, but we can't abandon him now.  If you're new to the series, start with the first book and go forward.  If you like the early ones, you'll probably get hooked too, but if you start with this dog, you'll never read another, and will miss out on some good stuff that has happened along the way.	2001-04-17

(There is some dispute as to whether it's a good idea anyway, see, e.g., Pavel Tsatsouline's Power to the People.)  But remember, this book is 12 years old, and weight lifting theories change all the time.<br />This is not the book to buy to start you off in weight lifting.  It's message is pretty darn simple, and can be conveyed in a review.  Do single sets of 20 rep squats 2-3 times a week.  Take in a boat load of chow and get plenty of rest, add 5 lbs. to the bar every week, and you'll get a lot stronger.  Some of the information conflicts with other sources, which seem to me to be more up to date and better reasoned.  The best iron game writer around is Stuart McRobert, whose Beyond Brawn and Insider's Tell All Handbook to Weight Training Technique should be the core of your training library.  (Strossen won't mind this recommendation, he and McRobert seem to be pretty well acquainted and mutually admiring.)<br />So, bottom line, if you're already well on your way down the training path, Strossen's book is an interesting read, but it's not going to serve as the basis for a comprehensive training program.	2001-04-11

Double Whammy and Tourist Season are inspired bits of lunacy and absolute must-reads.  Skin Tight and Native Tongue are okay, and Strip Tease had its moments, but since that time the formula has worn thin.  Stormy Weather and Lucky You start to strain the reader's patience for the same old patter.  Sick Puppy may be my last Hiassen novel.<br />The formula basically involves a cast of loathsome characters, who are delighted to despoil Florida's environment in pursuit of a dollar.  The hero is generally a little whacky as well, but in a caring sort of way.  The driving force for each novel is an effort to come up with wildly bizarre behavior.  This made for very entertaining reading through a few novels, but with each succeeding effort the general zaniness has become a bit more tired and a bit more strained, so that it now reminds me of Martin and Ackyroid proclaiming themselves &quot;wild and crazy guys.&quot;  <br />It's time for Hiassen to move on.  His earlier stuff is highly recommended.  You'll probably want to miss this one altogether.	2001-03-28

The reader is offered such old chestnuts as &quot;pay yourself first&quot; and stash ten percent of your income annually.  Gee, we haven't heard those tidbits before, have we?  And please, for about 99.9% of the population, that advice might add up to a comfortable retirement at a ripe old age, but it certainly isn't going to get you to financial independence any time soon.  The advice about investing is similarly a rehash of ideas we've heard a thousand times before.<br />There is almost nothing new here.  If you're a total newcomer to financial planning, this book might be an okay place to start, since it offers advice that has been around from many sources for a long time.

Favorite passages of mine are Card's musings on how nobody understands anyone else's motivations and his slamming of the American &quot;intellectual community.&quot;  If I were to criticize this book at all, I would say it's a bit too short, and seems to rush to the finish at the end.  He promises two more books in the series, but I think he/the publisher could have expanded this book a bit.  Nevertheless, a strong entry from Card into a series that by and large has been terrific (I confess, Children of the Mind, failed to hold my interest.)	2001-01-28

Rupert returns to the castle a changed man, just in time to battle the darkness that is threatening the whole kingdom.  A great, rollicking read, with sharp dialogue exchanges and battles every third page.  It admittedly took me a few chapters to get used to the dialogue, which incorporates some pretty modern idioms that felt a bit off key in a sword and sworcery novel, but in short order it was no longer a distraction.  I also think that the ending contained a fairly substantial inconsistency, as I had been led to believe that by the darkest hour, nearly every human being in the kingdom was dead, but after good prevails, a startling number apparently survived.  Oh, well, nothing's perfect.  All in all, a great book.	2001-01-15

This series is way too long.  Fully half of the thousands of words Jordan has written over nine volumes should have been cut, either by him or by an ethical editor.  You'd think he was getting paid by the word.  After volume 5 or so, I'd really had enough of this series, but I keep reading them because I have so much time into it now I'm determined to see how it ends.  I'm not buying them anymore though; I'm getting them at the library.  I'm not going to subsidize Jordan's addiction.<br />If nothing else, the publisher owes the readers a little summary of the books so far at the start of each book.  Jordan makes essentially no effort to work the background from prior books into the text of the current work (which is truly a breathtaking omission given how he loves to carry on), and I can only dimly remember a lot of what has gone before (this has been going on for years after all).  It's hard just to keep track of the names of the dozens of characters that flit in and out.  Jordan even introduced yet another &quot;minor&quot; character who obviously a significant role to play about half way through book nine.  Some editor has to get a grip on this guy.  Also, the prologue alone to this volume was 86 pages (hardcover).  I almost threw in the towel right there.<br />Anyway, after all that complaining, this was a stronger book than the last three or so.  Mat has emerged as the most interesting of the three lead characters, and he gets significant attention in this volume.  Still, for all that actually happened in book nine, if you cut out the meaningless minor characters and endless meanderings, this book could have been cut in half.<br />There's clearly enough holding these books together to keep me reading to the end, but I certainly hope book 10 is the final volume.  Jordan has beaten this horse to death long since.	2001-01-08

The riding and hunting scenes are very well done, and it appears that Moon must herself have a passion for these things.  The book loses its direction in the middle when Cecelia's spoiled nephew and his foolish cronies sneak off for a picnic and find themselves in the middle of a hunt where men are the prey.  The book eventually regains its footing and the ending is fairly strong, promising an interesting sequel (which I will certainly read).  All in all, a pretty good book.	2000-12-29

The scenario is complicated by the background questions such as -- how did this elf happen to turn up so conveniently, and is this all a big trap.

Sunny Randall's world view and dialogue are pure Spencer.  Of course, the Spencer novels have always (well, with a couple of exceptions) been fun reads and so is Sunny Randall.  <br />The story moves briskly, and the answers to the mystery hang together pretty well.  The ending, however, really deserves some protest.  It just ends.  Sunny learns whodunnit, and the curtain drops.  There's no wrap up, no letting the reader in on what she's going to do with her knowledge (options -- go to the police, continue searching for evidence to prove what she now knows happened, decide to let it go, set up the perpetrator to get caught . . . ).  None of these things happen.  I can only assume that the loose ends will be picked up in a future Randall outing, but it almost reads like Parker hit his deadline and banged out the last five pages so he would make it.  <br />Until the home stretch, though, this is a fun read.	2000-11-27

(The last one I remember like that was Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Wolfe.)<br />Martin has a huge case of characters, all of whom are compelling, which means he has the option (which he takes) to eliminate some of the central characters along the way.  Buckle up, it's a bumpy ride.  There are some serious surprises -- in the good sense -- not in the &quot;where the heck did that come from&quot; sense, more like -- &quot;wow, I didn't think he'd really do that.&quot;  The trouble with most books in this genre is that even though they're fun to read, there's a predictable pattern to them, and you know which characters are subject to mortal peril, and which ones will always survive somehow.  Not in this series.  <br />I'm also fascinated by the way that Martin is rehabilitating one of the most reprehensible villains from the first two books, and turning him into a sympathetic character.  <br />By no means attempt this book if you have not read the first two in the series.  They do not stand alone, and you will have no idea what is going on.  But this is a great series.  A must read for fans of the genre.	2000-11-20

It has a hard core political/economic message a la Ayn Rand (who admittedly, I haven't read in fifteen years).  But the transformation of Kahlan into a merciless, at times cruel, foe of the Order, and the Richard/Nicci plot line pays dividends to the reader who hangs in there.  <br />This is a strong entry into the series, but it had better end soon, before it degenerates into a Robert Jordan style quagmire.	2000-11-12

All the fundamentals are here, and mastery of fundamentals is all you need to outperform most of the competition.  Professor Murray is a long time trial lawyer, director of the Harvard Law School trial advocacy program, and has taught countless trial advocacy classes for lawyers.

US	52472165	R30LLOHZ5U4VJI	0399146601	927649912	Shattered	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Not his best work	Even mediocre Francis is still pretty darn good, so you can pick this one up with confidence that you'll enjoy the ride, but this is not Francis's strongest outing.  It follows a predictable formula from his earlier works -- likeable, but slightly flawed lead character, who has the mental toughness to stay with the hunt in the face of serious physical danger -- level-headed, no nonsense love interest -- creepy villain -- it's all there.  <br />There are some disappointments for long-time fans, however.  First, the tie in to the racing world is pretty tenuous in this one.  The lead character is a glass blower, whose best friend is a jockey who is killed in a race.  That's pretty much the end of the horse racing element of the novel.  The explanation for the hero's failure to involve the police earlier in the game is particularly weak.  The hero's flaw -- a tendency toward womanizing -- is developed in approximately a half a dozen sentences and is otherwise dropped entirely.<br />Bottom line.  Francis sleepwalks through a familiar formula here.  It's such a good formula that fans will like this book well enough, but he's done a lot better in the past.	2000-11-06

Set in Vermont, Mayor's books capture their setting beautifully with quirky local details.  But better still are Mayor's wild (yet plausible) plots.  In this, his latest, the police find a frozen body with several missing parts (which broke off when the body was dropped from a plane).  They quickly determine that the body belongs to a Canadian gangster, who disappeared fifty years earlier.  The plot brings detective Joe Gunther to Sherbrooke, Canada, and involves delving into the history of a suicide-mission World War II commando unit, the product of a joint Canada-U.S. effort.  One of Gunther's sidekicks -- the growling misanthrope Willy Kunkle -- brings a lot to these books as a character who evolves from book to book.<br />Just marvelous.	2000-11-01

Hannah Keller is a police officer who gets up before the sun every morning to pen her first thriller.  It hits it big, but when she rushes to her parents' home with the joyful news, she finds them dead, and her son, who witnessed the killings, in shock.  Some years later, she is a successful crime writer who gets sucked into an FBI scheme to catch another killer using her as bait.<br />The plotting is generally solid.  Keller is a fairly engaging character, although she is overshadowed by the FBI Agent, Frank Sheffield -- a sea kayaking beach bum who is trying to get to retirement in one piece -- who steals the show.  The musings on the writer's craft and life are a bit self conscious and I found them distracting.  The villain is a little too far over the top, and there are some utterly gratuitous bits of gross out in the book that are truly sophomoric (wait till you hear about the villain's disturbing childhood).  On balance, however, a strong entry, and I'll certainly read any sequel, if only to see what becomes of Frank Sheffield.	2000-10-17

After Burke's dog pansy is killed, and Burke is nearly killed in a hostage exchange that is really a set up, Burke goes on the vengeance trail.  Along the way, we find out a lot about Burke's childhood, and get to understand more about how he has become what he is.  We meet Lune, a fascinating childhood friend, and are introduced to Gem, a new female lead who promises to stay around for a while to come.  (Well, we'll at least get one more book out of Gem.  After that, it's anyone's guess, Burke's romantic interests often get hit in the cross fire.)<br />Highly recommended for Burke fans.  Start with the earlier stuff if your new to Vacchs.  You need to know Burke as an adult to really appreciate this trip to his childhood.	2000-10-06

Crais has created a wholly different character -- none of the snappy, wise-cracking, easy likeability that Elvis has, but a deeper, poignant picture of a woman who has &quot;always been a tough girl&quot; struggling to keep it together after some horrible trauma.  Carol Starkey, a detective, was with the bomb squad until she and her lover were killed when a bomb exploded in their faces.  The paramedics re-start Carol's heart after 2 1/2 minutes or so, but she carries vicious physical and emotional scars three years later.  When a bomb kills another member of the squad, Carol gets the lead on the investigation, and it takes her through a series of twists and turns that will keep you turning pages as fast as you can read.  This one shows that Crais has a lot of range.  Read the Elvis Cole books too.  They'are all great.  (L.A. Requiem is the best of the lot, but you'll enjoy it more if you read the earlier books in the series first -- you need to know Cole's sidekick, Pike, well to appreciate the book properly.)	2000-09-29

It's true that the book diverges off the mainstream of the plot from the first four books, but it's a pretty interesting digression.  In the fifth book, most of the action takes place in Ander, and the bulk of the book is only loosely tied to our main heroes, Richard and company.  Nevertheless, the political machinations and the social structure of Ander were really compelling reading.  If anything, I'd say book five returned to some original thinking (which was hugely in evidence in the first book, despite some opinions that it was derivative of Jordan's series).  I think books three and four dragged badly, but Soul of Fire is a worthy installment in the series.  If you're new to Goodkind, start with book 1 --Wizard's First Rule -- which is wonderful.  Don't expect too much from the subsequent books, which are merely okay.	2000-09-27

A truly original, epic fantasy.  I continue to plod doggedly through these dogs, trying to get to the conclusion, but really I'm going on sheer determination to finish the series now.  I'd recommend Eye of the World very highly to any fan of epic fantasy.  I frankly have forgetten where the series dropped into intellectual neutral, but I think the next two or three books were pretty good.  After that though, you've got to be prepared for some tough going.	2000-09-27
US	52472165	R3IT38YH5QTCFZ	0375706623	545631555	Choice of Evil: A Burke Novel	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A solid, but not great, outing for Vacchs	The Burke series is generally a great one.  Vacchs, an attorney who represents juveniles only, and who has a professional resume that proves he knows first-hand the horror that abused children experience, always generates an aura of reality in his writing.  The cruelty to children depicted in the Burke books is truly disturbing, because you know as you read it that this stuff really goes on.  Burke, a hard-bitten criminal, has enough redeeming qualities to make him a great anti-hero.  Among those redeeming qualities are a sense of deep loyalty to his &quot;family&quot; -- the close friends he has chosen (and who have chosen him), who will stick together in the face of any adversity.  The other major redeeming quality is his simmering fury directed at abusers of children.  The two come together in this book after Burke's girlfriend is killed at a gay rally and he goes on the vengeance trail, which of course leads him into the child abuse underworld.  The primary flaw in this novel is the strained dialogue between Burke and an important secondary character, Nadine, who is a gay domninatrix with a bizarre sexual fascination with Burke.  His tough-guy posturing with her is more or less in character, but it grows tiresome by the half way point, and continues unabated from there.  Nevertheless, Burke is always a good read.  As one of the other reviewers points out, however, it is hard to follow all the characters unless you've read the other books.  I'd start with the first and read them in order.  There is a linear development of the characters and plot that will make the book much more enjoyable if you know it going in.	2000-09-27

A great read, and better than the first book in the series, Rhapsody.  It loses one star because again I found that there were fairly substantial passages in the second half of the book that failed to hold my interest, and I found myself skimming through them.  That being said, there are many wonderful things about this book.  The lead characters --Rhapsody, Achmed, Grunthor and Ashe -- are all absorbing.  My favorite quality, however, was the way that Haydon evokes archetypal themes in the same way that fairy tales do.  The earth/water/fire/sky elemental concept is beautifully done, and the ages-old conflict among the races is wonderful.  All told, this is a great fantasy series and I look forward to the next entry.	2000-09-25

The presentation, however, drags frequently, and I  found that skimming long sections was the only way to keep moving.  In  particular, there is a journey through the center of the earth section of  the book, which is interminable and not particularly interesting.  Interest  in the ultimate fate of the compelling three lead characters, Gunthor,  Achmed and Rhapsody carry the book where the plot drags.  The book also  opens with two prequel-style chapters, which are never adequately tied up  in the first book.  The second book, Prophecy, ties these chapters into the  story line, but I was annoyed that the first book left these bits dangling,  seemingly unconnected to the main plot.  Bottom line, this is a promising  series, and I am interested to see what becomes of our heroine/heroes, but  along the way I fully expect to skim long passages.	2000-09-20

I had difficulty keeping track of who  was who and the interrelationships among the characters.  About half way  through the book, I simply threw in the towel, which is rare for me.  I've  read widely in this genre,  and generally insist on finishing a book once  I've invested so much time in it.  But this one just never gets going.   There are some interesting concepts in the backdrop, but the overall story  and characters failed to hold my attention.	2000-09-20

A more modest conclusion, such as  that the government designates too much stuff as secret might be supported,  but Moynihan's generalization is too much.  Also, the introduction to the  book written by Richard Gid Powers far outshines the portion written by  Moynihan.  Moynihan's stuff is a dry as dust.	2000-09-20

The actual substance of the book is much more  modest, and largely centers on hammering the need for campaign finance  reform.  Along the way, Huffington also trashes pollsters, and emphasizes  the need for citizen participation in government and in charitable  activities.  There really is nothing particularly new or ground breaking  here, but Huffington does a nice job of gathering together in one place a  lot of anecdotal information about her topics.  She bashes politicians of  both major parties evenly, and is apparently disappointed that the nominees  for the fall elections are Bush and Gore rather than McCain and Bradley.   Bottom line:  A good read, but don't expect to learn anything that rocks  your world.  One of her fundamental points -- that the American people have  come to expect their political leaders to be a pack of thieves -- is all  too true.	2000-09-19

Robicheaux, a recovering alcoholic, has a deep need for justice  but is attracted to violence like a moth to a flame.  I've loved all the  Robicheaux books, but I confess this one seemed a little strained.  I think  the primary problem with the novel is that Robicheaux's battle with his  darker side teeters a little too far toward making him an unattractive  hero.  Still, it's a good read.  If you're new to the series, however, I'd  read them in order, or at least start with some of the earlier books in the  series.  I think you need to be in Robicheaux's court coming into this one  or you'll find yourself not liking him very much.	2000-09-12
