I was expecting a \\"How To\\" guide instead I am trying to find information as simple as \\"Setting Up QuickBooks\\" or something similar. <br /> <br />Face it, QB is NOT an easy program to work with, especially if you have never used this type of software before; I am sure most of us have not. This book talks to the intermediate user of accounting and QB programs and does not address the newbie. I run a hearing center and I needed specific information on how to install, set-up and begin to working. The first 50-60 pages dealt with other versions of QB be it Entrepreneur and what not. This is NOT how the book should have been laid out. Information such as that should have been in an Appenidix. <br /> <br />The other REALLY bad part about his book is the complete lack of support from Intuit. Don't even try to call for any sort of how to help. All they are there for is to guide you thru installing the software, NOT setting it up just installation. ANY other questions you may have, you will be asked to buy a support package which ranges anywhere from $300-500 per year! The software cost me $150 and I am going to spend an additional $300-500 to answer some basic questions ot help me get up and running!? Absolutely ridiculous and a total lack of caring and respect for their customers. They try to hit with you with a ton of additional items to buy besides the software. Are you listening Intuit? <br /> <br />I would not buy this book. Actually I got it for free when I bought QB Pro 2005. This book is SO bad that I am actually givig it away an buying something else to help me. That kinda says it all.	2005-08-23

One of things that I hate is being in Manhattan and not knowing where to find things, like a wine bar for example. Now at least I have the beginnings of where to go to have a wine by the glass or purchase my favorite bottle of Shiraz. The book is set-up so that it is a VERY easy, breezy read. I picked this book up last night at the mall and was half-way through it my the time I got home. Being a wine nut, not just a hobbyist, I can tell you that the listing of specialty wine shops in NYC is worth the price of the book. It also gives the best description, one that I have been touting for years, of NYC, on page 67, that I have ever read. I do have two minor complaints with the book. Firstly, it is a bit light on the wine bar scene. I know of at least five more wine bars that definitely needed to be included. My other complaint is that it is a bit light when it comes to substance. Points are made in just a few sentences and that's it. Certain topics and sidebars throughout the book definitely could have been flushed out in greater detail. This I found very surprising given the fact that the authour is an ex-Wine Spectator contributor. Their writers usually go on and on so I found it ironic that the text was a bit laid back. I also found it funny that the author said that the Wine Spectator is the best wine magazine out there. Would he have said anything different? Overall, a good effort.	2004-03-27

The book has some very good ideas and tips on how to start an online business. The advice seems solid and logical, better then a few other books I've looked at. The main problem here is that most if not all of the links that are referenced in the book are either gone, outdated or don't have the information that the author says will be there. Needless to say this is very problematic when trying to find say, an ISP provider or a web developer. For example, I am looking to hire a professional to create my site. I went to one of the sites that the author mentions in his book. The site is there but is nothing more than yet another developer looking for business. It was supposed to be a site where one could find an array of talent that I could contact to get information, pricing, feedback, etc., on building my site. I find myself scratching my head once again searching for the information that I originally bought the book for.	2004-03-09

I read the first Art of Happiness book, actually I listened to it while In the hospital recovering from spinal cord surgery, and I found it a truly life changing experience. The teachings in that book have stayed with me ever since (2000) and I still try to incorporate them into my daily life. Now comes a topic that effects almost every single adult not only in the United States but the world. How many of us hate our jobs? I mean hate in every sense of the word? So much so that just the thought of Sunday night knowing that you have to go to &quot;that place&quot; literally makes you sick? We've probably all been there at one time or another, some still there right now. Now how many of us like our jobs? I don't mean tolerate our jobs, I mean enjoy going to and look forward to going to work? Probably a small number. Lately I've been struggling with the &quot;what do I really want to do with my life&quot; question as well as the &quot;I have to do something more meanigful and enjoyable than this.&quot; Face it, we spend more time with our co-workers then we do with our own children and family. This is a very, very sad statement. Anywhere between 8-11 hours per day are work related, not counting the tarvel time to and from the office which could add an additional 1-3 hours to the total depending on where one lives and the commute. Shouldn't we truly enjoy what we do during this time? Why do most of us hate our jobs, hate our career choices and hate our career direction? I guess alot has to do with the choices we made when we were too young and inexperienced to make a choice that would become so important in our lives. Face facts, most of decide on a career direction by the time we're 17-18-19 years old. I knew nothing at this age although I thought I did. And here we are, making life altering decisions, mostly on our own? How ridciculous. No wonder we're all messed up by the time we hit 40 or 50 years old. It is not burn out, which I assume contributes greatly to the condition, but a realization that there is more to this precious life then work, making money for someone else and having nothing to show for it except a nice house a fat mortgage. To those who actually read this book I hope to hear from you. I am very curious to see if this book is as fulfilling a one as the first one was for me. To see if there truly are answers to these questions and can we do more than just earn a paycheck for someone else, someone who can use us and fire us at the drop of a hat. I look forward to reading your comments. Sincerely, muzikman3161@yahoo.com	2004-02-01

With so many unauthorized and even authorized bios out there about talentless and useless &quot;celebrities&quot; I am so glad to a see a book that finally gives due to a true artist, someone with actual, measurable talent - Steve Earle. With complete subjectivity - I must admit I am a huge fan of Steve Earle. I have been so since his first album, Guitar Town. Since then I have &quot;re-found&quot; Mr. Earle's work over the last 5-6 years. With each album that he puts out he tends to raise the bar slightly higher. But the bar he raises is his own, one that only he must reach and overcome. His bar is not one that can easily be reached by too many artists. This book covers not only the artistry of the man, not just the music but what drives the lyrics behind the music. If you are a fan of Mr. Earle's music then this is a must-buy. If are only a passing fan or someone who is slightly interested in the man, the genere of his music (which is hard to define) or just looking for some insight into the creative mind - then I hight recommend you buy this book.	2003-02-22

Some of these so called ideas are so run of the mill my mom used to tell me these things when I was a kid. Some are a little over the top like using an alias when applying for a telephone. It seems that the worse thing tha can happen to someone is identity theft and I agree 100% with that conclusion. But on average what I read here is that he doesn't want the reader to keep getting unsolicited emails, telemarketing calls and direct mail pieces at your house. Personally none of these things is really that annoying to me. yes, I hate being interrupted while I am eating but if you put a block on yoru phone and make your number unlisted most of these calls go away. Trust me, I have tested this out and it really does filter out the unwanted garbage. As far as direct mail goes, I only open what I find interesting. I like getting coupons and discount letters, especially at Xmas time. If I can save a buck I'll use one of their coupons, why not? Junk email is annoying at times but there are filtering devices built-in to most email programs nowadays. I do agree with the author that you should have one email address that you only give to family/friends and a few others that you can use as dump emails for all other garbage. This really is a great idea. I would not waste my money aon this book. Get it at the library or via eBay or half.com.	2001-09-27

That alone is worth the price of the book. If this book does anything it'll make the reader more insightful to nutrition and it will force them to eat more fruits and vegetables. Not bad for a...book I think. The recipes are so simple to follow. The ingredients, for the most part, can be purchased in any local fruit stand. Yes, there are some obscure ingredients. I had no idea what silken tofu was until I read the preface. The stuff tastes great! Don't be afraid to try and drink something new and different. After all, what would you rather drink, soda or a smoothie? It takes a matter of minutes to put one of these drinks together - and that includes the preparation which usually doesn't entail anything more then a peeling here or there. If you have kids they will go nuts for this stuff. You can make them together. Then DRINK them together! Yum!	2001-08-28

I was browsing the shelves at Borders and just came upon this book. I picked it up and finished it in about 8 days. The book is written in a plain and practical manner. A very conversational style so that the author actually is speaking with you and not at you. The book offers some very practical, step by step suggestions that can be applied in real world situations. He provides numerous charts, graphs and tables that can be used when doing your property research. This can be applied to commercial and residential property. I am a total novice when it comes to real estate investing and I am actually thinking about getting my license here in NY. In addition to this book I would suggest that you read a few others just so you can get a well rounded idea of just exactly you might be getting into. The author does declare not to jump into things but once you find the right property - jump on it and go for it. Many a great deal have been lost due to fear and hesitation. I also highly suggest you read &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; and &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot;	2001-01-21

Although the Andrea Gail is definitely the focal point and  the reason for writing the book, the &quot;story&quot; is as much about the  life of those whose life is fishing as is it about anything else. Granted  we all know that those on the Andrea Gail are going to die. But they die  about page 175. The book has another 125 pages left! Obviosuly the story  doesn't end with the deaths of those on the Andrea Gail. There are heroes  at every turn of the page. From the parajumpers off the coast of Long  Island to the captains of the various ships that were being rocked by the  storm. Just try and imagine what it is like to be on a 75 foot boat looking  dead on into a 100 foot wall of water. Hard to believe that people actually  have done it and survived. But just as the narrative starts Mr. Junger  takes off on a history of the fishing industry in New England. He does this  numerous times throughout the book and it definitely tends to slow down  some very dramatic moments. I finished the book in a few days and it is a  VERY fast read. But when I finished I was not thoroughly satisfied. Hence  the Chinese food reference in the review title. Definitely worth the time  though. I have not seen the movie. I wanted to read the book first. But I  have seen a few docu-programs on it recently - from Discovery to TLC.	2000-07-10

I can honestly say that if both of us had read this book we might still be married. That is a HUGE statement to make about a book, and obviously both parties have  to WANT to change, but I believe this book can help. The book breaks down  the typical men and women are different writings that are so prevelant  nowadays. Yes we are different. But why are we different? How are we  different? Dr. Scantling makes the argunment that there are four different  sexual styles and each has it's own description, M.O., definition, traits  and style. After reading her description it was fairly easy to figure out  what I am. But, I found that I also had the traits of the other three  styles as well. THAT is what is so key to this book. It provides the  ability for the reader to not only identify with one's self but with one's  mate. It is like having the answers to the SAT prior to taking the test. It  also gives key talking points that can be used to open up a dialogue  between you and your mate.<br />I highly suggest you pick this book up if your  marriage or relationship is in trouble. As I stated in my opening  paragraph, if I had this about 18-20 months ago I might have not gotten  divorced. Keep the lines of communication open between both of you, don't  demeen your partner, remember why you married them and most of all - BOTH  OF YOU MUST WANT TO DO THIS.	2000-06-17
US	51374019	RSBO57WSYBHY1	0446525766	243454269	The Protein Power Lifeplan	Books	3	19	26	N	N	Good, but it takes forever to get into it	I am on the fence regarding this book. On one hand the information contained herein is useful and informative. On the other hand it at times is so difficult to follow that the reader starts to skip pages to get to  the meat of the author's premise. The book is abut 350-400 pages. Not until  about page 300 do the authors detail the Protein Plan. Granted, you need  some of the upfront information in order to understand the reasoning behind  the plan. But I think a better layout would have been to outline the plan  in say Chapter 3 and then intersperse the information throughout the  remainder of the book. The authors are so knowledgeable about their topic  that they tend to forget that they are writing to a layperson, not a  nutritionist. They also tend to get defensive when it comes to their plan.  The idea of high protein low carbs bent alot of people's noses out of  shape. Why? Because it really does work. I have been doing it for awhile  and you do become leaner and stronger. No two ways about it. I am 38,  5'11\\", 167lbs, 13% bodyfat. It works. Carbs fill you up and slow you  down. You feel bloated and lethargic. High quality protein, nutritional  whole foods, fresh juice, veggies, fruits, etc. all contribute to a better  way of life. But you must include exercise. I'll repeat that. You MUST  include exercise. Eating right alone won't work. This would not be the  first book I buy on nutrition. Nancy Clark wrote a terrific book that I  would suggest you pick up first. This book takes some time and experience  before you get to this level of understanding and desire.	2000-05-24

It also has an incredible formula to help you  compare the many fixed rates that you will be bombarded with. So if you are  receiving rates of 7, 7.5, 8 3/8 plus 1, 1 1/2 and 2 points you will be  able to calculate the APR for EACH of these different fixed rates.

But after reading this book I am extremely well versed in both. I have been interviewing both buyer's brokers and mortgage lenders and I am  extremely well prepared when I call them and when they walk thru the door  to meet with me. Buying a home is probably the most money any of us will  ever spend at one time. Why not be totally prepared to do it. We spend  countless hours reading thru Consumer Reports just to buy a micorowave or a  VCR. Don't you think you should be spend hours upon hours studying real  estate, mortgages, taxes, etc.? I certainly do. That's why I picked up this  book. In total I've read about 6-7 books on the subject. This is definitely  one of the better ones. It is comprehensive, informative and detailed. I  found myself underlining and using the language and suggestions in the book  when talking to the brokers and the lenders. Many of them were impressed  with the amount of information I knew about THEIR business. I am in the  process now of negotiating my mortgage and so far I've gotten the lenders  to decrease the points by .50 PLUS they agreed to pick up some of the  closing costs as well. This could mean a sunstantial savings to the bottom  line, maybe $2000-3000. We're not talking clipping coupons here anymore!  Buy the book. Save some money. Learn about your subject.

It is a book that deals with and discusses technology, research and marketing in a very readable manner. I sat down and blasted thru 60-65 pages in no time. The content makes sense. For  anyone interested in tapping into the untapped market of online cutomers  Forrester are the pros. They have been THE Internet research company for  years. I have met Mary Modahl and have seen her present. She knows what she  is talking abut and it comes through in this book. The first 65 pages are  worth the price of the book alone. All of us who are in 'the business'  think we know the business. Not true. We are in the forest and much step  back and get fresh ideas, a fresh perspective. We don't really KNOW who are  customers are and how to reach them This book can give us a clearer  understanding of how to attract them and where to find them.

Actually I was kind of bored and was looking for a hobby. Having been a bartender in my younger days (I'm 38), I always loved beer. So I figured &quot;Why not make it&quot;? So  I browsed the bookshelves and came across a few books. I picked up another  book by Chuck Papazian that was supposedly the &quot;Bible&quot; of  homebrewing. After leafing thru it I thought it was a waste of time and  alot of hype (see my review). Then I found this book. I have always been a  fan of the Dummies Series and own about ten Dummies books altogether. This  book is continues the tradition of a solid, informative read. It is written  in a very light, conversational tone that makes the novice feel like they  can make beer that competes with the big boys. It goes into the equipment  you need, the ingredients and various gadgets and such that might make your  brewing experience a little bit easier and definitely more fun. You don't  have to read it in a linear fashion, you can jump around from section to  section and then refer back to things that catch your eye. When the novice  gets a little more adventurous you may want to try one of the many recipes  listed in the center of the book. The bottom line is for the money this is  one of the best books that I have ever seen on the subject. And, after  participating in a few newsgroup discussions on the topic, (and these guys  KNOW their beer), even the newsgroup members recommend this book. THAT says  alot.	2000-02-03

I went to the bookstore and checked this book out. Now, I am a novice when it comes to homebrewing, that's why I thought this book would be perfect for me. But after reading  thru it I noticed that 80% of this book is written for the Intermediate to  Advanced brewer. For somone like myself this book really is pretty useless.  Yes it gives a listing of what to buy to start brewing but after a few  pages of directions and some pictures (adults who are drinking while they  are brewing) it ends. No substance at all. No follow-up. nothing. From here  it goes directly onto an Intermediate section then to the Advanced  sections. What a waste. Now I am sure Chuck Papazian is a nice guy and  knows alot about the topic, it just that he doesn't concentrate enough on  the Novice brewer. I NEVER brewed beer in my life. SO what do I need to do.  Where do I buy this stuff? Ingredients? Supplies? A short list of supplies  is given but how about better pictures? The repros of the supplies are  horrible. No detail at all. Now this isn't Chuck's fault, it is the  publisher. So in trying to keep the book under $15 they delte vital photos  and the reader suffers for it. Definitely an overrated book. The book that  I think is MUCH, MUCH better for the novice is &quot;Homebrewing for  Dummies&quot;. Now this book actually gives more detailed information on  the nuances of homebrewing. I would rather spend a few more bucks on this  book than &quot;The Complete Joy...&quot; book.	2000-01-23

When I compared those figures with the actual figures in  Value Line, they were inconsistent. For someone like myself who is not all  that great at math to begin with, I need as much guidance and clarity as I  can find. The author throws out terms but not all of them are clearly  defined, this does not help when attemtpting to do complicated math  equations. He would have been better off showing a copy of the Value Line  pages that he mentions then highlight each area within that page as it  relates to the terms he is using. Return on Equity, Book Value, Current  Book Value, etc. mean nothing to me if I don't know where they are located  on the Value Line page.	1999-07-15

I found myself reading passages that I have read many times before. Lots of rehashed advice but nothing of real substance  when it comes to choosing a good stock. They spend 35 pages telling me why  Coca-Cola is a good company! Duh!Read any Peter Lynch book or Buffetology  or Trouncing the Dow and save your money on this one. I am a fan of the  Fools but they need to come up with original material. I downloaded thier  new monthly magazine (no charge) and noticed once again that most of the  information was taken from past articles.	1999-07-09

But, if you have any experience at all with stocks, bonds, trading, etc. then I would pass on this book. The writing style is written for the junior high school  level. I would buy Chuck Carlson's book for a more advanced approach to  DRIP's and DIP's.	1999-07-02
