US	52472200	R1D40HJEN4ZRR	0304296090	77185374	Master Mariner: Running Proud Bk. 1	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Very Long... Interesting Concept...	This book could have been excellent. Monsarrat is a good story teller. I think this book should have been expanded into several volumes rather than it's current form. The entire first section is devoted to a third person history lesson on the life and times of Sir Francis Drake. It culminates when the Spanish Armada is set to invade England and is driven off. That is when the real story begins.<br />As an adventure story, this one is a little lacking. As a history lesson, it is good at showing some of the more obscure incidents in time. Wilbur Smith and Gary Jennings are the masters of adventure/history.<br />Anyway, if you decide on this one, plan on it taking a long time to read. Very little action to speak of and only one real character is developed.	2003-07-22

Authors 45 years ago had a lot more scruples than they do today. Even knowing that, this is a great adventure book. The characters are well written. The descriptions of the scenarios is great.<br />The basic plot is well worn, but it occurs in Alaska so that adds a new twist to the story.<br />The time is when Alaska was still owned by the Russians. The Czars were still in power. Alaska was a long way from Moscow and governed by the military who rarely received instruction from Moscow.<br />It's the story of an orphan that makes his way in the world based on his own skills and intelligence. He has a dream of going to Alaska. He never forgets the dream. On the way, he meets up with several extraordinary people that help him along the way. During his journey, he is involved in much of the history of the exploration of the west. This is a history lesson as well as an adventure.<br />The pages turn very quickly. It is easy to put down and pick up without missing any of the story. It's a perfect book for vacation or travel reading.	2003-07-22

The first is an excellent story of the discovery of an ancient lost city and the mystery that surrounds it's demise. There are three main characters. The archeologist, his assistant and his best friend. The assistant of course is a beautiful and intelligent woman. The men vie for her charms.<br />The second story goes back to the days of ancient Africa. The the last years of the city. This time there are four main characters. The king, the high priest, the oracle and the barbarian king. <br />The characters in the first story are looslely associated with the characters in the second story.<br />Anyway, what an excellent book. I have been reading an average of 125 to 150 pages per day. It's a real page turner.	2003-07-22

This race is much more advanced than the humans. At least 50 years. Truly giant ships and fast planes. I would say they are advanced similar to America just prior to WWII.<br />The ending is left wide open for the next two or three novels. I hope Forstchen keeps it up!	2003-03-10

Not really a book. <br />It has been several years since the end of the Napoleanic Wars. Hornblower is assigned to the squadron in the West Indies (Carribbean) as the commander in chief. A frigate is his largest ship. Most of the squadron consists of sloops and brigs.<br />A lot of politics and philosophy going on. A couple of historical incidents.<br />Overall, this feels like the end of a career. Not real graceful, but worth the reading.	2002-11-06

A lot of it is about politics on land just before and during the beginning stages of Napolean's invasion of Russia.<br />Hornblower has some new fangled weapons that he has never used before. Bomb ketches. He has two of them. What they really are is small vessels containing two 13 inch mortars each. The are ideal for bombarding with a plunging fire over walls and other obstacles. Incredibly accurate and very destructive. Hornblower has two occasions on which to use them. And, as might be expected, with great success.<br />Anyway, Hornblower is made commodore of a small squadron of ships, including Nonsuch captained by none other than his life long friend, Bush. He is set upon a mission to assist the Russians in the Baltic in any way in which he see fit. Perfect orders for someone that is willing to think outside the box.<br />Hornblower ends up sinking a French privateer. As can be expected, the French are outraged and invade the small country of Pomerania in defiance. This causes the Russions to become a little upset. Eventually, the French launch the invasion of Russia. The Russians are soundly beaten on all fronts except for the small port town of Riga. Hornblower is able to help with the defense of the town and it's approaches. He even leads an infantry assault into the French trench line.<br />This is another good book. Not a whole lot of naval action, but enough to keep the nautically minded interested. Lots of politics and history though. There is not a lot of information on the Baltic theatre of the war. Napolean was being attacked and beaten in the south by Wellington. For some unknown reason, Napolean thought that it would be a good time to attack Russia. His invasion started during the summer. They were in moscow by November. But Russia's ally, Old Man Winter, was waiting. He chased the French all the way back to Poland and beyond. During the withdrawal of the French, his allies were defecting left and right. First the Spanish and the Portugese. A few weeks later the Austriand and Germans, then the Prussians.<br />Well worth the read.	2002-10-14

Not the best one, but a very good installment. This one picks up right where the previous one left off. The author does not spend much time introducing the characters or the plot. It gets right into the action.<br />In the previous book, the humans have just been defeated soundly and are in full retreat to the lands of the Roum. The Bantag are in hot pursuit. The humans are counting on the winter weather to halt the Bantag campaign. However, since Ha'ark is from a different (modern) world, he understands the importance of continueing the campaign once the enemy is on the run. He pursues the humans and begins the seige in the dead of winter.<br />Ha'arks lines of communication and supply are tied to a single rail line leading all the way back to the Great Sea. Several hundred miles. The port city is resupplied via sea from the land of the Chin. Ha'arks supplies take 10 days to reach the front lines from the Chin. Ha'ark has plenty of trains and ships ferrying supplies. <br />I tell all this because resupply is the only Bantag weakness. If the humans can disrupt the resupply, even for only a few days, the tide of the battle will turn. That's all I will tell about the battle.<br /><br />If you're reading the series, this one has to be read in the correct order. If you are not reading the series, a lot of the storyline may be confusing. There are lots of reference to events and people in the previous books.<br />Bottom line, this is a good book.	2002-10-04

Haark is back ain as the evil Bantag leader. In the previous book, he had arrived through one of the \\"tunnels of light\\" from a world that is roughly 100 years ahead of Civil War era Earth. He is aware of many advanced technologies...<br />The humans are still struggling to throw off the bonds of the  Bantag and the Merki. The Merki are licking their wounds to the West and appear to be out of the war for the time being. However, the Bantag have been sitting in the Chin cities for two years developing new weapons and training in tactics under Haark.<br />When the strike finally comes, the humans are ill prepared to counter it. It is one retreat after another. Of the three large human armies, two are cut off and surrounded. Hans with an army of over 50,000 is stranded the farthest away. Over 200 miles to the coast and 500 miles to the nearest human city. Keane and O'Donnal are stranded to the south near the Great sea with an army of around 40,000 including several thousand wounded in the opening battle.<br />The third army, under Hawethorne, is held in reserve. It numbers around 80,000.<br />Hans decides to retreat towards the sea instead of back to the city. His retreat is across open steppe. His orders to the soldiers are walk or die. Wounded are left behind with a weapon and ammo.<br />New weapons are introduced by both sides in this conflict. Haark comes up with winged flyers, mortars, and land ironclads. The humans come up with faster and more menueverable flyers, armor piercing artillery rounds, and a secret weapon at the end....<br />This is a book on a grand scale. Several large, continuous battles. Not as fast paced as previous books, but it sets the groundwork for the next book which should be very action packed.	2002-09-23

This book occurs late in the war, right before Napolean abdicates the throne the first time. Hornblower has been a lord for several months, however has been recuperating from an illness. He is sent on a mission to capture a brig that has mutinied and is threatening to surrender to the French.<br />Hornblower is successful in the mission and at the same time lands himself right in the middle of political intrigue in a major seaport on the French coast. He is able, with the help of several leading citizens, to capture the town and have it reaffirm the old French King as the successor to Napoloean when he is defeated.<br />Of course, Napolean is not to happy about this situation and he send an expedition to fight the rebelling city and throw the English back into the sea. Hornblower expects this and send to England for help. Who should arrive? None other than Captain Bush, Hornblower's close friend.<br />Bush sets off inland via a river to intercept the oncoming seige train and wreck it while it is still in transport mode. He is successful, but at a terrible price. Around that time, Bonaparte abdicates and is exiled. France is returned to the Bourbons. Hornblower sets off the visit the Compte de Gracae that helped him escape when he was captured two years before. During his visit, Bonaparte escapes and reclaims the thrown.<br />Hornblower is deep inland at this time. He helps a local partisan movement. However, his small group of 30 guerillas is hunted down by several thousand French soldiers. He is eventually captured and sentence to be executed. On the day befor the execution, word comes from Paris that Bonaparte has been defeated at Waterloo and has again abdicated. Hornblower is released.<br />Not a lot of sea fighting going on this book. Most of the action takes place ashore in France. A lot of political intrigue. C.S. did a fine job of depicting the political situation in France at the end of the war.	2002-09-17

The setting is 1935 Ethiopia. Ethiopia is a landlocked country. The League of Nations has imposed a weapons import ban on all African countries. The Italians don't have to deal with this ban because they control one of the countries. That's the political situation.<br />The Italians are on a rampage in Africa to gobble up as many countries as possible. They have been doing a massive military buildup along the Ethiopian border. The Ethiopians know what is about to happen. They enlist the aid of two &quot;men of the world&quot; to buy and deliver four ancient armored cars and a variety of other weapons.<br />Throw into this mix an American reporter that happens to be a beautiful woman, an ancient Ethiopian cheiftan who wants to fight battles the traditional way, an Italian aristocrat that has purchased his commission and you have a good mix to create a story from.<br />This is a long book, but interesting. The chapters are long. The story is very entertaining and at times even humorous. Wilber Smith has done an excellent job of capturing this era in time. The details of the scenery and the people are right on.<br />If you are an Italian, you probably will not enjoy they way that Smith has stereotyped them. But, it is believable...	2002-09-13

I read them in the biographical order of Hornblower's life.<br />This book immediately follows Ship of the Line in which Hornblower has just fought a tremendous battle against overwhelimg odds. As might be expected, he had to &quot;Strike&quot; his colors at the end of the battle.<br />In this book, he is a prisoner of Bonaparte's government. The story takes him from the castle at Rosas, scene of his final engagement, all the way to central France. In Paris, he will face a military trial on his &quot;acts of piracy&quot; and will then be executed along with his first lieutenant, Bush.<br />Along the way, He, Bush and their servant escape. They find refuge in the home of a local French nobleman that has no liking for the Bonapart government. After recovering their strength and waiting out the winter, they make their way down the river to the Bay of Biscay. Once there, Hornblower daringly captures an armed cutter (which was recently captured from the British) and makes his way to sea.<br />He is then picked up by the channel fleet. He now faces a courts martial for his role in the loss of the Sutherland. I won't go into the details of the trial, but since there are further books in the series, you can assume he was not handled too roughly. <br />As an aside, Bush is finally made a post captain. Hornblower's wife Marie took ill during his absence and has gone to another world. His remaining son is now with Lady Barbara. He gets to meet the Prince Regent and is knighted. Admiral Leighton has been killed in a daring raid on the ships that Hornblower had crippled in the previous book.<br />Only one disappointing feature of this book. Nearly the whole book takes place on land. There is a sea battle, but it is seen through the eye of Hornblower while he is a prisoner at the fort at Rosas.<br />Other than that, it is still a good read and fits in well the series so far.	2002-09-04

Forester departed this earth in the middle of writing this story. Even so, this is a very good book. All the normal details that you have come to expect are there. Hornblower not quite trusting himself or his decisions, a stickler for rules and regulations, intense clashes of arms with the hated Frenchies...<br />This story is mostly about how Hornblower hands of the Hotspur and heads for the Admiralty to acquire a new ship. His previous admiral, Cornwallis has named him as was the custom when an admiral retires. So, Hornblower is expecting to be made post and gain command of a ship. <br />After leaving the Hotspur, he is being conveyed to England on a watering ship. Along the way, Hornblower is involved in the courts martial of the captain that recently took command of the Hotspur. Apparently, through some blunder in navigation, the Hotspur was lost. The captain and officers are being sent back to England for further orders. They find themselves in the company of Hornblower once again.<br />Along the way, they are briefly chase by a French brig. Hornblower and company contrive to capture the French ship by ruse. They succeed, only to lose the ship soon after to the much larger brig crew that is battened down below. Upon retreating from the ship, Hornblower snatches up the ship spapers and orders.<br />With these papers in hand, he proceeds to Whitehall. His capture of the documents leads to what the rest of the story was actually going to be about. Hornblower will be the leader of a small group of men with the sole purpose of delivering a carefully worded forgery to the French admiral in the hopes that he will quit his santuary and proceed to sea. The orders will direct him to a supposed meeting place with another French fleet. This is where the English line of battle ships will be waiting to pounce.<br />The story never gets that far, but one can only imagine what it would have been like. Hornblower would have been in the thick of things. Probably in command of asmall frigate.<br />The other two short stories included with this reading are both interesting. Nothing special, but worth the time it takes to read them. The first is about Hornblower soon after receiving his leutenancy. The second is well into his life. Probably in retirement in the year 1848.<br />This is a very good book. If you are into Hornblower, this is for you.	2002-09-02

Then, it moved into some real action with some believable SF. <br />Then came the profanity and the sexual overtones. I could deal with that, but after about 100 pages it grew old. And to make matters worse, all of a sudden the book moves into totally unbelievable situations and events. I don't mean unbelievable like \\"Wow that's cool!\\" I mean it like \\"There's no way this could happen, that's stupid...\\"<br />And to top it all off, there was still about 125 pages to go and the story was going downhill fast. It seemed like the writers recognized that the plot was fading and they hadn't developed an ending. So, they apparently decided to throw in a lot more sex scenes more often.<br />The writers should have stuck to SF and not to their sexual fantasies. <br />I finished it (against my better judgement...)  Only because I am waiting on a book in a series that I am in the middle of. If I had it, this book would have gone by the wayside very quickly.<br />Anyway, the first third of the book is \\"ok\\" to \\"almost good\\". After that, you can decide.	2002-08-31

But, I do not think that this is what the author intended. <br />This is a light hearted look at fantasy/fiction. Easy to read, hard to get lost.

The amount of detail is incredible. However, if you didn't start at the first book, it takes a while to catch on. Also, if you don't read the books in order or even soon after each other, the relationships of all (and there are a lot) the characters to each other and to the plot becomes a little hazy.<br />I would have given this one four stars except for the fact that the story is so complex and you can't just leave the series for an extended period and then start again and hope to understand what is going on.<br />Card remains one of my favorite authors.	2002-08-21

Character development is good. Some parts of the story leave a little to be desired. The characters seem to stumble across information without having to work for it. I think that a longer version of the story might have been better. More details instead of conicidences or just plain being in the right place at the right time so often.<br />Anyway, this is a fictional (?) story of what may have happened to Hitler's second in command, Borman, during the closing days of the war. Escape by submarine with secret papers and orders to continue the cause after the war ends. The sub gets sunk in a hurrican in the Carribbean. A local diver finds it 40 years later and exposes the contents of the orders....  The British government, as well as the remaining Nazi sympathizers are very interested in obtaining them....<br />Enough about that. This is a fast read. A good book to read if you are traveling.

His home world appears to be around 100 years ahead of earth of 1865. He talks about nuclear weapons and jets. It will be interesting to see how this character develops the hordes.<br />At one point, the author indicates that the total population of the humans on the planet outnumber the hordes by 10 to 1. That is an interesting fact.<br />Two new civilizations are introduced. The Zulus and the Chin. The Chin are currently enslaved by the Bantag horde.<br />This book is mostly about the life of imprisonment that a &quot;pet&quot; of the horde must endure. Towards the end, the slaves revolt and few escape. The last third of the book is devoted to the escape of this small band. Several minor clashes and one large one.

A little slow in the beginning. Hornblower has to get an aging Danish two decker (74) outfitted and manned. The book goes over all the difficulties of manning a ship after nearly 15 years of war. All the best seamen and topmen are exempt due to working in the Honorable East India Company. As is to be expected, most of his new men come from the press gangs and the jails. Landlubbers all....<br />But once at sea, he shapes them up and molds a crew that will fight. He is part of a small squadron of ships that is sent to harass Napolean's flank. They are sent to interdict the supplies coming from Barcelona.<br />As can be expected, Hornblower does a comendable job. He has several immediate astonishing successes. When his new admiral comes on the scene, the failures begin to happen. The admiral appears to not be quite the seaman or tactician that is required for this venture. He apparently received his command through the influence of his new wife's (Lady Barbara Wellesley) family.<br />During these failures, Hornblower saves the day by rescuing the admirals flagship, accomplishing a strategic withdrawal from a land attack after the Spanish abandoned him and finally...<br />The end of the book is quite surprising. Hornblower discovers a French squadron of ships of the line, four in all, including one three decker of over 80 guns. He knows the strategic value of slowing or stopping this squadron. After 24 hours of shadowing this squadron, he makes the decision to fight it out. Knowing that his ship will become a wreck and that most of his crew will be killed or maimed, he goes at them.....<br />This is a good book and a fast read.	2002-07-18

That explains a lot. It is actually the sixth, chronologically, in Hornblower's career.<br />First of all, Lieutenant Bush is back. But, it is not too well described the relationship and history between Bush and Hornblower. But, this is the first book written, so at the time of writing, there wasn't any history....<br />Anyway, Hornblower is his typical self. Very unsure of his skills and abilities and far too worried about keeping up his image in front of the men.<br />The story is excellent. A seven month voyage on a secret mission. Hornblower follows his orders explicitly. Never to touch land until his destination. Well, imagine how the world of politics can change in seven months. Hornblower has had no new information about the war since he left England.<br />Enemies are now friends. Friends are now enemies.<br />As for the action scenes....   This is one of the best described ship to ship sequences I have ever read. As usual, Hornblower is outgunned. However, he has the smaller faster ship and is able to outmeneuver his opponent. The battle lasts well over 12 hours of his time. It is interupted by a driving storm and night. <br />At dawn, the enemy is sighted. There is little or no wind. Hornblowers lowers the boats and begins a stern chase by being towed. As he closes, the other ship uses it's heavier weight of iron to deliver broadside after broadside at extreme range. Hornblower has to endure this for several hours before his smaller guns are within range. At that point, the training and discipline of the English sailors takes it's toll.<br />With the politics aside, this book is a great read.	2002-07-15

Higgins introduces the main character very quickly. They are easy to identify with.<br />This is the classic story of good v evil. Might v Right. The lowly Irish peasants against the aristocratic English gentry. Into all of this is thrown a Confederate cavalry officer with American ideals about freedom and liberty. He must choose sides.<br />A good book if you are in a hurry. Not a lot of depth to the story or the characters. Higgins has left the ending open for a followup with some of the same characters if he so chooses.	2002-07-09

Still, it was interesting.<br />I guess that if you are following the career a a naval officer over his lifetime, there will be a point where he is not actually in the middle of the fight. This book was one of those. <br />Hornblower has been given a secret mission to recover the payroll of the invasion fleet of the previous year. There are four tons of gold and silver. The government is badly in need of fres cash. The treasure lies on the bottom under 110 feet of water inside of a ship that capsized and sank upside down. <br />To accomplish this mission, Hornblower has been given an expert in slavage and three pearl divers from India...  Enough about the story.<br />The book was well written. The hardships of the officers and men of a small ship, far from home and away from the fleet. Good reading. This is a part of naval life that is seldom written about.	2002-07-07

Once again, the humans are at war. This time against a more maodern army using gunpowder and flying ships.<br />Forstchen does a very good job in keeping the reader interested. Apparently, the aliens of this worl at one time were a very advanced space-faring race. Something dramatic happened to them many thousands of years ago to push them back to their current state as nomadic warriors. Forstchen hints around at the incredible machinery that they used to have. At one point, the Merki come up with an engine that they dug out of one of the graves of the \\"ancients\\". Apparently some kind of nuclear reactor. Several Merki die as a result of harnessing the engine...<br />Anyway, the Merki are a band of warriors that are triple the size of the previous Tugar. And, they are using similar weapons to what the humans have. The Merki can field between 350,000 and 500,000 soldiers. They do have a fault. They do not believe that fighting humans is dignified. Or that using these new human weapons is glorious.<br />This is an excellent book with a surprise ending. It leaves you wanting to immediately go on to the 4th in the series. Unfortunately for me, I don't have the 4th...  Yet.	2002-07-03

The songs were a little lame. My daughter enjoyed it though. She has already watched more times than I can count.  :)<br />My problem with it was that some of the scenes were just way out of character if you take the original film into consideration. The original film was a good work. <br />But, all in all, this film is right on for the younger audience (under 8). They probably won't even notice any of the differences between the original and this one.	2002-06-30

Even a naval battle. <br />Too bad the author has to waste so much time in the beginning reintroducing the characters and their history. If Forstchen could skip that and go into more detail with the plot...  <br />Either way, this was a very good follow up to Rally Cry. I read back to back. I finished Rally Cry (#1) and immediately picked up Union Forever (#2). I have Terrible Swift Sword (#3) in my hand right now. After reading the irst 60 or so pages of Union Forever, I was right back into the main story.<br />Excellent book. I hope Forstchen can keep up the pace. The end of the book leads us to believe that it will be the never ending battle. Fine with me.....<br />The series so far:<br />#1 - Rally Cry<BR>#2 - Union Forever<BR>#3 - Terrible Swift Sword<BR>#4 - Fateful Lightning<BR>#5 - Battle Hymn<BR>#6 - Never Sound Retreat<BR>#7 - Band of Brothers<BR>#8 - Men At War<BR>#9 - Down To The Sea<br />I have them all......	2002-06-30

I immediately went out and acquired the second and third books in the series. Similar to an alternate history, but on another planet with a unique ruling class/civilization. It will be interesting to see if their history is uncovered to show what brought them to the state that they are in.<br />Although not entirely believable, It is a good action book. Plenty of battle sequences. Lots of detail on strategy and movement. Hardly any wishy washy content at all.	2002-06-24

The story is a little out of date now (it was originally written in 1978), but it is still good.<br />The beginning of the book is a little slow. Probably the first 100 pages or so. Bova takes quite a bit of time introducing the characters and the environment. But, once through that, it move along.<br />It not an exciting book, rather an interesting book.<br />The main character, David, is very interesting. His life and how he perceives his future and destiny.<br />Worth reading.	2002-04-11

The first 150 pages deal with the initial settling of Hawaii by the Polynesians. It is of course a fictional account, but is quite reasonable that the settling actually occurred this way. 1,000 years before Columbus sailed on his voyage of discovery.<br />Michener could have gone on with just this story. How the first settlers accomplished the discovery and settlement of the islands. It was that good.<br />But, then he goes to 1820 and begins the second story. The missionaries. I had no idea how the missionary culture of the time worked. Very rigid and controlled. They came mainly from Massachusetts. And, they were on a &quot;mission&quot;. <br />I won't say any more about the story. As everyone knows, Michener is a very talented storyteller. His attention to detail is excruciatingly accurate. Sometimes too accurate, but always entertaining. And, you get a history lesson at the same time.<br />I plan on reading other Michener books in the future.	2002-03-26

It is also a book about nuclear winter. The author presents the idea that nuclear winter may not be as bad as originally thought. As the story develops, the idea of the US launching a first strike against Russia is believable.<br />Anyway, this is ok. Not great, but not bad either.	2002-03-18

At that time, I thought it was interesting, but didn't really pay too much attention.<br />Now that I am leading projects, it is a whole different landscape. I take the book down and read several pages at a time as a refresher.<br />This is still a good resource to understanding object technology. Now that I have the benefit of actually doing some of the coding, this book makes a lot more sense and is actually very interesting.<br />For someone that is new to objected oriented projects, this is a good book.

I remember it so well that I felt compelled to right a review.<br />Anyone that is familiar with WW II and the naval campaigns will want to read this book. This is the story of a light cruiser with a new captain. The previous captain (if I remember correctly) was court martialed for cowardice. He was a close friend of the new captain. That's the first sub plot in this book.<br />There are other plots that that happen throughout the book. The book is so well written and the character so well developed that I can still remember the pleasure of reading it. There were good guys and bad guys, creeps and regular Joes. The ship is like a small town.<br />Oh, I left out the battle sequences. Wow! Incredible. Even the aftermath and cleanup after the battles was well handled. The cruiser limping back to port for a refit and overhaul.<br />The ending is a little sad. But, after you read the book, you will understand why it had to be so. <br />If you at all enjoy WW II naval action, this is a must read book.	2002-03-06

I have always been a history fan. The stories surrounding the fate of the Titanic have always intrigued me.<br />I knew of Ballard from previous expeditions that he had done. I have seen his work on The Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel. <br />This book is well thought out. From the search in the early days to the actual discovery and exploration. It's amazing how Ballard was able to stick with it over the years and the difficult times. <br />The book is written more as a story than as a text book. Plenty of history. The underwater photos are magnificent. I read the book and just wonder at all the problems that they had to overcome. The setbacks. The failures. It's all here in an easy to read and follow book.<br />If you are at all interested in the Titanic and it's discovery, this is a good book to read.	2002-02-25

A little dry at times, but interesting. <br />Conway was one of the first westerners to take the philosophy of Dr. W. Edwards Deming and apply it to business. Deming's ideas had been spurned by western corporations for years. He took his ideas to Japan and flourished. Conway took notice of it and studied. He was in a position to apply the ideas to his company. It was a major culture shock, but it turned his company around.<br />The book is full of useful ideas and insightful examples of the ideas at work. At my company, it is at the top of the reccommended reading list for managers. Right up there with Stephen R. Covey's &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot;.<br />Anyway, it's a good book for middle management to read to help them succeed.	2002-02-25

In the beginning of the book, they explain the rating system very thouroughly. Once you understand the rating system, it becomes easier to read the descriptions of the camp grounds.<br />Also a bonus (to me) are the literally thousands of ads on nearly every page. It's kind of like the yellow pages of the camping world.<br />They don't give a lot of detail about the campgrounds. Just the pertinent information as it pertains to the ratings. However, there is always a way to contact the campground, usually via email (which works fine for me).<br />We are planning a trip to Cherokee, NC this summer. This guide helped us narrow down the field to around five campgrounds out of over 25.<br />Not the definitive resource, but definitely the starting place for most camping adventures.	2002-02-21

I bought this one for my nine year old son. He received a tank setup for Christmas. Before I would let him start it up, I asked him to review the book. When he was done, we talked about the different responsibilities of taking care of a fish tank.<br />To my surprise, he grasped the fundamentals immediately. I took a look at the book and discovered that it truly held a wealth of information for the beginner. Everything from water filters to alkalinity.<br />There were no in depth details, but enough to make the reader grasp the concept and be able to ask intelligent questions.<br />An adult could probably go through this book in an hour or two. My son took several days and was pleased with his accomplishment.	2002-02-21

I read several of the Hornblower books years ago. At that time, I vowed to acquire them all and start from the beginning (in chronological order). <br />This is a great series! I just finished this, the third in the series. Hornblower is becoming quite experienced in ship handling. Bush, who was introduced in the previous book, is now is first lieutenant. Hornblower has been promoted to commander, one step below post captain, and given command of a sloop-of-war of 18 guns. <br />He becomes a vital part of the Inshore Squadron during the blockade of Brest. C.S. does a wonderful job of describing the situations.<br />Points of interest in this book: Hornblower get married and has a son, Hornblower is involved in shore excursions on enemy shores, Hornblower is involved with the taking of the Spanish treasure fleet, Hornblower fights a duel between his sloop (18) and a heavy French frigate (44).<br />There is one nagging point that I have. C.S. spends a lot of time letting the reader know about Hornblowers thoughts. It's especially bad when Hornblower has self doubts. But, once you get used to this style, the book flows quickly.<br />The conclusion of the book is quite sudden and is left wide open for the series to continue.<br />I hope to see Bush and Hornblower together again. Maybe he will even reacquire his steward, Doughty.<br />Good book!	2002-01-25

(4.5 stars)	...When I was younger, I read a few of the Hornblower books and decided to shelve the series until I had them all. <br />As other readers have indicated, this book is not the first written. However it is the first in chronological order of Hornblower himself.<br />All that said, this was a really good book. The first night, I read over 100 pages without stopping. It's really not a flowing story as much as a collection of short stories about the life of a particular midshipman in 1794.<br />He is first stationed on a Line of Battle ship. CS doesn't really describe the ship much, but by what the surroundings seem to be like and the number of officers, I'd say she is a two decker of 74 guns or so. On this ship his life is one of misery until he gets a fair shake from the captain.<br />On he goes to a frigate and the real adventures begin. Enough said, I don't like to tell the story. You can read it.<br />This is a good book. Easy to read. Each chapter is 20 - 30 pages and tells an entire short story. They are unconnected stories(other than the characters and the ship).... They can be read individally.<br />I look forward to finishing the entire series. I too have the companion book. This is a good tool to help the reader keep up with the actual locations of the stories and some of the history surrounding this period in time.	2002-01-02

Coyle must have done a tremendous amount of research for this one. Some of the settings and characters are truly well done. This time period in America (prior to the Revolutionary War) is not real familiar to a lot of folks. This book presents this time very well. It is part history lesson, part action/romance.<br />At times Coyle was a little long winded when setting up the next scene. But, if you pay attention, you will learn something new about the history of the United States. George Washington make several appearence as a young man in the Colonial Militia. Times were hard back then. Especially on the frontier. The frontier extended all the way out to the Ohio River Valley. A lot of the middle of the book takes place in what they called the Wilderness.<br />I can reccommend this book.	2001-12-26

It is actually three seperate stories. None of the stories are connected other than through a common theme of a long term war between the Humans of Earth and the Kzin civilization.<br />The idea is a good one. The Kzin are a catlike race that has become the rulers of all they survey. The premise is that they are raised from birth to fight. Very aggressive. They always think it is better to kill the unknown rather than try to understand it.<br />However, the execution of the idea didn't work out so well. The first story was pretty good. Short, but good. It should have been a book by itself. It would have been a great starting point for a series. I even read the second book in the series just in case....<br />The second and third stories were not very good. I read about 30 pages in the second story. It felt like work to read it. I kept trying to come up with excuses to not read it. Finally, I gave up and skipped to the third story. Same thing....   A couple of pages in it and I closed the book and put it in the trade in pile.<br />Anyway. Use your own judgement. Read a few pages of the second story. It is a majority of the book anyway.	2001-11-21

This is the only one that I have read.<br />The beginning of the book is a little confusing, but once the story gets started it is actually interesting. About 2/3 of the way through, the story begins to slow down and become predicatable. <br />The end is predictable.<br />Overall, this book is ok. Easy to follow. Not too many characters.

The articles are out of date, But Bova came up with interesting stories of what may happen in the future. <br />The first story is the best of the lot. Battle stations protecting the earth from itself. multi national peace keeping force....  Mutiny and destruction...<br />The next good story is the international baseball teams. Instead of war, play baseball. Nixon is the team manager of USA when they go up against Cuba for influence of the Carribbean. <br />Anyway, it's an ok read. Ben Bova does a good job of story telling.	2001-10-22

It is told from several points of view. Primarily from the squad sargeant who is a Marine from the pre-war years.<br />I read it when I was younger and really enjoyed. I picked it up this time out of curiosity. I'm glad I did.<br />It's also a good history lesson about the morals and ideals of this period in time.	2001-10-04

I have not yet read this actual book. However, I can vividly remember all three stories of the set. They are incredible. I bought this volume because the price is right and the story is one that can be read again....   I am hoping to introduce naval fiction (the age of fighting sail) to my friends. This set would be a fine way to do that.	2001-10-04

Unfortunately, it did not read like a normal historical adventure novel. It was more like a nonfiction account with some novel material thrown in here and there to try to keep you interested. I read the first 100 pages or so and began to grow disinterested. Finally, I stopped altogether.	2001-09-19

I don't like to give the plot away when reviewing, but the whole idea of a modern army being trapped behind enemy lines....   How cool! And fighting their way back through....	2001-09-18

A little predictable and corny at times, but the overall plot was a good one. There were several small stories all happening at the same time. Nance kept you hopping from one group of characters to the next.	2001-08-03

I read this book a while back and can still remember most of the details. I remember how vivid the scenes were. I could easily picture in my mind what it must have looked like and been like. The icy water, the towering waves....   The rocking ship, the smell in the confined places. Smith did a wonderful job of creating the scenes....<br />The story was good too... A little slow in the beginning, but once the characters were created, it moved along quickly.	2001-08-01

Card did a great thing when he wrote this one. The whole idea is amazing. I've read this book twice... When it first came out and again recently. Both times I thought it was great... Even when I knew what the ending was going to be.<br />Kids fighting a war light years away vis instant communication and virtual reality. <br />This is a must read! It's very fast!	2001-08-01

It was not here. More politics and philosophy...<br />But, it was still a good story. A little long (even boring in places), but good overall. You definitely need to read Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead before you begin this one.	2001-08-01

The story is interesting, but no where near as intense as Ender's Game. Lot's of politics and philosophy here...  Kinda' makes you stop and think about your own values and the values of our society.<br />If I had not already read Ender's Game and I had just picked this one up, I probably would not have finished it. My respect for Card is so great that I finished it up even though I was not very interested.<br />If you have already read Ender's Game, this one will be ok. If not, steer away. Card has better books that you can read.	2001-08-01

I wouldn't say it was predictable, but it was taking too long between incidents. I rarely felt like I had to keep reading...   Several times I just wished it would end. I am an avid reader, so it takes a lot for me to not complete a book. This one was close. <br />Oh well....   I still think Crichton is one of the best!	2001-07-31

This book was way cool. The plot is so believable. By now, I know everyone has seen the movie. Don't let that stop you from reading this book. The movie was close to the story line, but there is so much more in the book.	2001-07-31

Follett is one of my favored writers. This book is another fine example. The depth of the characters is immense. The attention to detail when describing the surroundings. The detailed explainations of the technologies they were used during this time period. Everything mixed together to make a well rounded, very readable book. <br />At times, the plot is very sad....  At others, you can't put the book down because so much is happening...<br />This is one of my favorites.	2001-07-31

The explainations of the technology used are so believable and plausible. As with Jurassic Park, the movie only tells part of the story. This book definitely needs to be read.....	2001-07-31

US	52472200	R357B26XJMD7QI	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A Fast Read	This was a pretty good book. I took it on vacation. I read it in four days. The story is easy to follow...  The idea of how time travel is executed in this book is very interesting if a little implausible. I don't know very much about the year 1350 or there abouts, but the book did seem to be authentic. The scenes that were protrayed were close enough for me.<br />If you're looking for something with not too much depth, this is a good book.	2001-07-23

Very concise and descriptive. Photographs are wonderful. This is the book that I chose to help me plan my next vacation. Obviously, this book does not contain everything, but it helped me narrow down what I needed to focus on. National Geographic did an great job.	2001-07-23

However, the story slowed down. It was still very interesting, but there was a lot of information that really had no relevance to the underlying plot. The end of the story was predictable. Thankfully, the final part of the book was only 25 pages long and ended swiftly. As with nearly all of his books though, it is worth the read. I recommend it.	2001-07-10

Great history lesson	Until this book, I had not really given much thought to reading fictional accounts of the ancient Egyptians. This was a great book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br />The characters were well thought out and described. The story (as with all his books) was well put together and included plenty of detail describing the events and cricumstances of the day. I plan on getting the second book of the series very soon.	2001-07-10
US	52472200	R97B4AXUBOBF4	1557503478	803804455	The Hornblower Companion	Books	4	11	14	N	N	Good Reference for the Hornblower saga	I just got this book three days ago....   I was very excited when I got it. I have read several of the Hornblower novels years ago. I want to get back into the saga from the beginning and use this as a visual reference. <br />This book is similar to the one that was created for the Patrick O'Brian books. However, the second half of the book is notes and personal thoughts of CSF himself. Very interesting. I am looking forward to finding out the inner thoughts of this great author as he created and developed the Hornblower character as well as the various other characters.<br />The first part of the book presents maps and descriptions of the various events for each of the books. It's a wonderful tool to help understand visually the circumstances of the events of the books.<br />This book is a bargain for the Hornblower fan.	2001-07-10

There is plenty of action to keep the story alive. The sheer adventure of this time in history is amazing. <br />A couple of hundred Spaniards conquoring several million Aztecs! But, it's more than that. I feel I received a history lesson of this place and time. The descriptions are great. Jennings did a lot of research to get this one right.<br />I plan on reading the sequel very soon.	2001-07-10
