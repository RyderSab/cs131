Let me state I love this series of books and own all of them. So I'm predisposed with positive feeling before I start reading.<br />However, this book felt like a formula book for the 1st time in this series.<br />* Re-run psycho guy after Stephanie (villian retread was disappointing).<br />* Where were the two guys vying for Stephanie? They had minor bits of support or saving, seemed uninterested in Stephanie, and especially uninterested they were both elements in her life. Where was the tension, the big build up, when she finally hooked up?<br />* The lawyer guy was not as amusing as Grandma or Lulu, why was he hanging out with Stephanie?<br />I hope this series isn't running out of steam. Stephanie seems backed into a corner romance-wise: can't have a relationship with Joe without ditching her job, can't have a relationship with Ranger because you don't have relationships with him.<br />Support characters I have grown to love were not developed further.<br />I hope book nine reverses this dip in the series.	2002-07-21

The bright yellow cover caught my eye, the title interested me, the read was fun and fabulous. With the popularity of Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, this book hits pay dirt featuring the differences between men and women. In short women affirm each other's feelings and men only affirm facts. The main character is the guide to women for men clients. She falls for her CEO client and also finds out she needs training too. Witty and enjoyable, I'll definitely return for more books by this author.	2001-10-30

She knows what she wants and  goes for. But I equally enjoyed our hero's reaction to direct approach. The  give and take between the two characters in this book is lots of  fun.<br />Nora Robert's writing bumps up a notch for the trilogies. This book  is a terrific example of why she's the best.	2000-08-29

Nora Roberts can write a billion more books like this one. I most enjoy  her romance books. When she goes into mystery or plots where the romance is  secondary I haven't enjoyed those books as much. In fact I was concerned  the author was taking a break from the romance genre.<br />I love the  characters, a woman running from an unsatisfying life and finding love and  herself in the process. Who wouldn't fall in love with the wonderful man in  the book. We can all dream these guys exist (and stay that way!).<br />I look  forward to reading the other two stories in this trilogy. Nora Roberts'  book trilogy featuring the Quinn brothers was also enjoyable reading. Check  it out if you haven't read them.<br />Thanks Nora for another fine romance!	2000-08-13

Part 1, Emmeline's life at the mill  earning money to save her family. This section of the book was interesting  and gripping. The lonely Emmeline, thrust into the strange world of the  mill, reaches for comfort and ends up banished.<br />Part 2, Emmeline's return  to her family. This part of the book was depressing and sad. Emmeline  returns home but her family has grown up and away from her. She never feels  comfortable sharing her experiences at the mill. Her mother has turned  inward and her father isn't a warm person. When she finally finds love, it  is only for a brief time. Emmeline's world is shredded by a shocking twist  that forever isolates her from human contact. A major bummer of an ending!	2000-07-08

Thank goodness who said &quot;Drop the Dress&quot; was resolved immediately. The two men in her life and stilling buzzing around her. It  must be tough! Actually I thought there was too little &quot;action&quot;  for our Miss Stephanie. Let's pump up the &quot;action&quot; volume for the  next installment!	2000-07-04

I found this delightful story while browsing the library stacks (sorry Amazon, but libraries save me major money!).<br />Emma strives to reconnect with her father, whose artist  lifestyle provided an unconventional childhood and distant relationship.  Emma is so focused on her father and &quot;getting the relationship  right&quot;, she doesn't see the opportunity for relationships with others.  But as she works through this critical relationship she then is able to  move on.<br />The author made you understand why Emma had to resolve the  father-daughter relationship before she could open up to other  relationships. Charming tale about understanding others and our roles in  their lives and their impact in ours.	2000-07-03

It has been a while since I've stayed up late to read.<br />The story spoke to me. Passion and its consequences are strong forces in life.<br />The courtroom drama was  one of the &quot;can't put this down&quot; sections of this book. I cried  at the verdict, the writing stellar, I felt for every character.<br />This is  my first book by this author. It most definitely will not be the last.	2000-06-29

I enjoyed the humor embedded in the story. Other reviewers mentioned the main character was exasperating but I liked watching her grow as she embarked upon her  adventure of life on the canals. Her determination NOT to get involved and  then keep him away from our hero wasn't always logical, but when is love  logical?	2000-06-08

No more, she has disappointed me again.<br />The main character has a fantastic job, a husband that adores her, a client that adores her, and she adordes them. That's two-thirds of the book right there. Which lucky man will end up with the beautiful blond? Who cares?  She's dull, they are dull, even when she cheats on her husband it's dull. I  sense a theme to my review.<br />Danielle, I remember gripping books full of  characters and situations that I couldn't wait to finish. I remember sizzle  and passion that I could daydream with.<br />This book makes &quot;The  Dummies Guide to Investing&quot; seem like one hot read!	2000-05-03

Nora Roberts seems to be heading away from romance and concentrating on adventure with a splash of love. I miss the old style, having found her romance stories full of engaging characters and lots of sizzle. Yep, I'm missing the sizzle.<br />The characters are engaging but the murder mystery is  the main course with only a side of romance. If you are looking for mystery  and romance, author J.Evanovich provides both.<br />Nora wants to spread her  wings, that's her right as a writer. But I'm missing the sizzle!	2000-05-03

If the major point of this book was: it wasn't fun to be a woman in this timeframe, then that point was made clear!<br />Unfortunately the main character, had a dreary life, family, and love.<br />The father is clinically depressed, the mother is a nag, the sister is self-centered and migrates to  wacko, the Grandparents are cold and uncaring.<br />The friends are a kind  prostitute and weird tinkerer.<br />The love of her life doesn't have the guts  to even pursue her and then marries the sister. When she marries an  adventurer who turns out to be an abusive sicko, I was wondering good  grief, can it get any worse? Oh yes, it can. A trip to a remote region,  total isolation and despair, then finally the love interest helps when all  is almost lost. But the moments of bliss are brief and our heroine is  dumped and alone again. But don't worry her love finally comes back.<br />I  didn't like the main character. Why was she relentlessly determined when  only faced with the bad that life had to offer? I don't know, but maybe I'd  have cared about the character and what happened to her if I'd had more  insight.	2000-04-02

I certainly want my dollars invested to yield ME the most.

Brief chapters makes you feel like a speed reader!<br />Theprimary villian in this book is certainly one evil creature.

This is my first read of this author. I love the female PI series of Grafton, Evanovich and Kijewski so I was psyched to try Barnes.<br />Unfortunately I found the sidekicks most annoying. Paolina, a  surly teen who seems to be heading to a life of prostitution, and Roz, the  painter/boarder, focuses on the next sexual partner above all, both of  these women I didn't want Carlotta to hang with but she was loyal and true  to these two. Perhaps previous books would have given me a since of history  and caring for these sidekicks.<br />Now the mystery didn't catch my interest  either. Gwen, the volleyball buddy wasn't a good friend so I didn't care  when she was arrested. The client that gets killed also didn't  appeal.<br />Summing it up, I'd try another book by this author but I'd like  to find one where annoying characters don't rule Carlotta's life!	2000-03-18

Two women in different countries struggle to cope with life events they didn't want or deserve. By switching homes for the summer each woman stands solo and moves forward through the other's world.<br />I'm a fan of this  author. Her novels are wonderful reads.

She'd probably make an excellent  therapist if she hadn't chosen to be an author.	2000-02-19

This well crafted book was my first exposure to author P.Robinson.<br />I enjoy double timeline stories, interweaving the past and present. This one weaves a WWII tale that ends with murder with the present day investigation  of it. The investigator, Banks, had many layers to his character. I look  forward to future insights into this character. The murder tale was  intriguing, and the resolution satisfying.<br />My only nit-pick, is the  subtitle &quot;A novel of suspense&quot;, is incorrect. The book was a well  told mystery but didn't have me on the edge of my lazyboy in fear. Rather I  kept reading to find out what happened and why.	1999-08-08

Unfortunately it takes 3/4 of the book to get to the point where the character decides she  has the right to make a decision for her own happiness. The realization  that she could choose herself first, was painfully slow. The new man in her  life was also less than enthralling. Older, reeling from his recent loss,  he mistakenly pushes her away.
