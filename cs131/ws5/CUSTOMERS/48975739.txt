Stacey Hawkin Adams' debut novel will really hit home for anyone who has ever tried to run from God!      Serena Jasper has just learned a secret that will change her whole life. The night she learns she has been accepted into a prestigious university, her mother delivers some devastating news of her own. This news drastically changes everything Serena has believed about her life. This news affects Serena so much that she turns her back on her mother, the church and God. Speak to My Heart really deals with the psychological destructiveness of secrets and how God uses the people in our lives, even the people who hurt us the most to heal us.        While Serena is the main character in the book, many other characters give the book a rich and fast paced storyline. Erika, Serena's roommate must deal with a boyfriend who is physically and emotionally abusive while Twanna, a teen Serena mentored must deal with an unexpected pregnancy. All of the characters in the book are very real people who must deal with the ups and downs of everyday life. They remind us that sometimes life causes us to take our focus off of God and the people that matter and need us the most. There are times in all of our lives where we feel doubt, insecurity and distant from God. I recommend this book for anyone who is going through a \\"spiritual dry spell\\". This book reminds us that God speaks to us even when we are not listening. He speaks words of forgiveness, reconciliation, encouragement, restoration and love. And He continues to speak until we are ready and willing to hear Him.      Happy reading!        Reviewed by: Tonya Sabrina Hall for The GOOD GIRL Book Club and [...]	2005-09-27

Sharon Ewell Foster's latest novel, Ain't No Valley reminds us that nothing brings out the worst and the best in people like a wedding. Remember the Parable of the Wedding Banquet (Matthew Chapter 22) or the Parable of the Ten Virgins (Matthew Chapter 25)?    Ain't No Valley continues the story of four best girlfriends; Mary, Latrice, Naomi, and Thelma. If you're new to Foster's novels, there's no need to read any of her previous books first to enjoy this one. Fans of Ain't No River and Ain't No Mountain will recognize several familiar characters in her latest novel, but this is not the kind of sequel that requires reading the books in order. No matter what order you read them in or when you read them, Foster's books are always filled with wit, love and spiritual insights!      As Mary prepares to start her new life with Moor, some of her family and friends are struggling to find their place and purpose. Ain't No Valley tells the story of friends and family members from all over who are making their way to San Francisco for the wedding of Moor and Mary. The California Dreamer, The Baltimore Charmers and the North Carolina Contingent are the names Foster gives to the three groups that are traveling to the wedding. As everyone makes the journey to San Francisco for the wedding of Moor and Mary, they are each on their own spiritual journey that will lead them to the ultimate reward.      The one aspect that I loved and appreciated the most about Ain't No Valley is that it had a contemporary message for everyone, no matter where you were in life (single, married, unemployed, employed, young or old) or where you are in your walk with Christ (saved, a backslider, lapsed or just not sure anymore). The lessons that can be gleaned from the Song of Solomon, Proverbs 24 and Daniel Chapter 3 are priceless. But the one great thing to be gleaned from Sharon Ewell Foster's latest novel is that we all go through a valley experience. You get so deep in the valley that you can't seeanyway out and you can't see anyone else there but you. We get so deep in our valley that we forget the there is still hope and joy to be found. Our experience in the valley reminds us that we have to talk to Him. We've got to trust Him. We have to let Him get close enough to see into our eyes. We got to let Him get close enough to whisper in our ears. And you got to let Him get close enough to operate on your heart (Ruthie's message).     Ain't No Valley is more than a novel-- it's a life-changing message to be read over and over again.    Happy Reading!	2005-09-08

Jackie King Scott's short novel, The Allure is packed with much wisdom and spiritual insight that is helpful whether you happen to be married or single. This novel teaches us how quickly things can spiral out of control when two people lean on their own understanding and stop letting God direct their paths.      Valerie Townsend is experiencing what is commonly referred to as the seven year itch. After going through the ups and downs of marriage and trying to conceive a child, Patricia feels as if God is leading her to end her marriage to John. To make matters worse, Patricia thinks that God is offering her a second chance at marriage by bring Curtis, an attractive divorced Christian man into her life. What Patricia fails to realize until she attends a women's retreat and attends a session entitled \\"Wait on the Lord\\" is that waiting does not mean that you sit back, expecting God to provide an automatic solution to your problems. Waiting is preparing yourself by remaining in God's will so you will be ready to act when He intervenes. Patricia also comes to realize that while she has been blaming much of the marital problems on John, she too must shoulders some of the blame. Her way of thinking led her to believe that it was John who needed to make changes when in actuality she needed to make some changes in herself in order to improve her marriage.      The Allure is full of messages that offer hope, fidelity, real love, commitment and restoration. By the conclusion of this short but powerful novel, Valerie learns what we all eventually learn. We cannot direct our own paths. We must pray and allow God's will to be done.     Happy Reading!    Reviewed by Sabrina Hall for The GOOD GIRL Book   [...]	2005-09-08

I truly enjoy novels with a take-a-way value and characters that live with me long after the book is closed. Bernita (the main character) grew up in what folks in 2005 call a \\"dysfunctional family.\\" Her mother was unfit and uninterested, her Aunt Babe was a harlot of sorts and her grandfather was emotionally abusive. What's a girl to do? Bernita grows up to become successful after being taken in by a loving family. However, on her path to self-discovery as an adult, she begins to deal with the demons that she didn't have a chance to overcome when growing up. Thus, she goes from unworthy man to unworthy man in search of love. At one point in WHEN LOVE CALLS YOU BETTER ANSWER you see the turning point where Bernita learns to love herself with the help of God, her friend and her Aunt Babe who is an angel of sorts watching over her life from the heavenly skies. <br />  <br />After much pain, disappointment, fear, turmoil, loneliness, heartache and betrayal... one day, love calls Bernita.  <br />But....will she answer?  <br />  <br />While the novel was slower at some places than I would have liked, Bertice Berry is an author who has the unique ability to create real characters with real issues to overcome on the journey to self and true love.

In her FABULOUS debut novel, Xenia Ruiz introduces us to two characters that will stay with you long after you read the last word. Eva Clemente is a professional, saved Afro-Latina woman who is happy with her life. She has survived a failed marriage, a bad relationship, raising two sons and all the drama that can always be found when you have an extended family. And despite the urging of her sister and her best friend, she is uninterested in a relationship with a man. Adam Black is a probation officer and cancer-survivor, carrying a load of bad female experiences.  While he adores his mother and his sister, he has a less than positive view of other women.      When these two meet, it is more than obvious that they share a mutual attraction. However, Xenia is reluctant to enter into a relationship with Adam because he is more of a Mr. Right Now than a Mr. Righteous. Adam's life experiences have left he questioning whom God is and why does he allow people to suffer. While Xenia life experiences have made her know who God is and to see suffering as an opportunity to grow spiritually.     There are many underlying themes that run throughout the novel-abstinence, racism, infidelity and spiritual, emotion and physical healing.  I found so many things to love about this book. It was a moving and well-written story bout two mature adults who learn more about themselves and each other as they grow close to God. I really loved the author's use of scripture and poetry to move to story along. But the one thing that I really loved about the novel was Adam. Adam is one of the most positive African-American male characters I have read in a long time. As the novel progressed, I fell in love with Adam right along with Eva.     Xenia Ruiz is definitely an author we should keep on our radar. CHOOSE ME is based on her own personal experiences and I admire her courage and honesty in sharing her story.

Soon these women are on the path to friendship, excitement and spiritual maturity.     Patterson is a Georgia peach who has dreamed of being a model all of her life. Patterson has led a life thanks to the strict Christian upbringing she has received. Patterson soon learns that despite her solid faith, she is not prepared for the fast pace life of the city with its bright lights, loud music and slick men.  Patterson's strict moral values and faith will be tested as she tries to adjust to her new life and her new friends.     Having survived the loss of her husband and friend in a matter of months, LaRue is angry with God. She too moves to New York to pursue a new life. And to run from God, who she feels has let her down. But no matter how fast she runs or where she goes, she finds that she will never be far from Him.     Finally, there is the spoiled rotten Macy who has been pampered all her life. She's been in school for years jumping from major to major as her parents foot the bill for her extravagant life. After failing to graduate once again her parents have had enough. The prospect of having to fund her own lavish life style causes Macy to take LaRue and Patterson in as roommates.  Can these three very different women live peacefully together? No! Well, not at first.     Jacqueline Thomas does it again! Thomas delivers another novel that is contemporary, engaging and filled with spiritual insights.

And with those two simple words, new author Kimberley Brooks takes the reader on a spiritual journey for single women. The novel closely follows three friends as they deal with the highs and lows of being single Christians.     Michelle and Liz are more progressed in their Christian walk then their friend Sandy.   Michelle has had a difficult time finding the man God intended for her. Her most recent relationship with a man from her church ended badly and left her with unanswered questions and more than enough tears and heartache.     Liz is called to be an evangelist and she is devoted to the Lord. Between her mother's drama and Sandy's antics, Liz is running out of patience.  Slowly, Liz realizes that God places people in our lives for different reasons. Some people are there because they need our help. Some people are there because we need their help. But all are there because they need our love. Liz also discovers love in the most unexpected place. But then again, that is just like God to do the unexpected!     Sandy is a relatively new convert dealing with the struggles of leaving behind her worldly ways and her old approach to relationships. Everyday, Sandy struggles with what she knows to be true and what the world tells her is true.     As HE'S FINE...BUT IS HE SAVED evolves, the three women find themselves beginning to lean more on the Lord and each other. We find that not only does their relationship with each other and those around them change, but so does their relationship with Christ. Each woman takes her own spiritual journey of self-discovery that makes her a better friend, a better daughter and a better Christian. Throughout the novel we see them in their Christian walk, and see them each deal with the issues in their lives. We see them living according to the Word of God, in prayer and in scripture, which the author uses freely throughout the novel.

In WHAT A SISTA SHOULD DO, Yvonne Hastings is a minister's wife whose husband's unfaithfulness/extramarital relationship and physical abuse brings their marriage to a crossroads (how she managed to stay with her husband after the very first sign \\"he was no good\\" in the earlier part of their relationship/marriage is beyond me).  Pam Lyons has a husband (a wanna be record producer basiclly taking up space in the house she is working to pay for) who places more trust in money, fame and marijuana than in God. Taylor Johnson is a single mother who is looking for a good Christian man to help raise her son, but is unable to rid herself of the guilt left over from her promiscuous past. The secret of Taylor's child's paternity is the catalyst for the tumultuous relationship between the three women (You have got to read the novel to discover who the father really is and why oh why she kept it a secret so long trying to protect a man so unworthy). IN WHAT A SISTA SHOULD DO, Taylor, Pat and Yvonne learn unforgettable lessons about life, love, forgiveness, unconditional love, prayer, sisterhood and most important of all-loving yourself, letting GOD fight your battles and free you from the chains of your past to prepare you for a glorious future. WHAT A SISTA SHOULD DO does not disappoint and Warren out did herself as a debut author. Check it out and tell a friend!!  <br /> <br />Marina Woods The GOOD GIRL Book Club [...] <br />	2005-06-09

I have been a believer in Christ for over twenty years. I've prayed and saw my prayers answered. I have prayed and heard from GOD. I have prayed and some of my prayers have not be answered (at least not yet anyway) and I have prayed and only heard silence. I turned to classical prayer teachers like Andrew Murrays' Christ in the School of Prayer. I grew bored with prayer thinking that GOD wasn't really listening, nor was HE planning to change things. But HE did have Patricia Raybon's book planned all along. <br /> <br />I TOLD THE MOUNTAIN TO MOVE by Patrica Raybon is an answer to prayer. Poignent, real, heart-wrenching, soul-stirring, thought-provoking, inspiring, faith-filled and written like only a master penster truly set apart by GOD to deliver this powerful, tranforming message of prayer. I TOLD THE MOUNTAIN TO MOVE reminded me that prayer doesn't change GOD, prayer changes me so GOD can work through me. That I am an answer to someone's prayers, too. Like Mother Theresa once said, \\"I see GOD in the face of everyone.\\" Raybon reminded me of this. To live this out. To pray without ceasing, not for material things but for what really matters in my life and the life of others. To walk in forgivness, love, kindness and respect and display that (with the help of prayer) to others even those who are not like us or even remotely close. <br /> <br />I've waited my whole life to hear this message. It has taken my prayer life, my communion with GOD-listening, journaling and speaking to a delicious new level. It reminded me that I am not alone. <br /> <br />You'll truly be delighted, thankful and grateful for the words on every page. At goodgirlbookclubonline.com we've received numerous emails about how I TOLD THE MOUNTAIN TO MOVE changed their prayer lives for the better. For this and more, we say, \\"THANKS.\\" <br /> <br />You'll love I TOLD THE MOUNTAIN TO MOVE. Keep prayer alive! <br />P.S. Grab a few as gifts.

I first fell in love with Victoria Christopher Murrays' writing style with her very first book, Temptation several years ago.  Several novels later, I am not disappointed. While I loved Temptation, Joy and Truth Be Told, GROWN FOLKS BUSINESS is among my very favorite summer reads!! <br /> <br />DL men and the women who love them (or) were left by them have been all the buzz, and Christian women alike have been trying to sort through the various emotions of the realization, that DL was happening in everyday life and in some cases their very own lives. With GROWN FOLKS BUSINESS, Murray has masterfully spun a delicious fast paced read with just the right doses of spirituality and faith that is sure to make GROWN FOLKS BUSINESS a bestseller while an answer to prayer for every woman, every age. <br /> <br />Let's follow Sheridan as she relies on GOD as never before. If you didn't believe GOD was with you in the storms of life, you will definitely see HIM present in Sheridan's. <br /> <br />GROWN FOLKS BUSINESS is a page-turner. A stay in all weekend and up all night type of novel. You'll love it and don't forget to grab one for a friend or two, too.

It was Oprah who once said, \\"Everyone has a story.\\" <br /> <br />In Scripture we read that faith is the substance of things hoped for, evidence of things unseen. Faith, hope and courage are central to our existence and thriving, not just surviving. How We Got Over: Testimonies of Faith, Hope and Courage are inspiring, spirit filled vignettes written by men and women who have overcome challenging situations in life through their faith in God (and with the grace of God). Each vignette is written with clarity and affirms the power of the \\"I AM\\" that is ever present, always seeing and always knowing in each of our lives regardless of apparent circumstances or obstacles if only we recognize and yield to it. How We Got Over is filled with life changing and powerful stories that will fuel and/or restore a rock solid faith in God that lies within you and me at all times. <br /> <br />Much like the Bible, you can turn to any page and find the right words that will quicken your spirit and resonate with your soul. Each of the stories in How We Got Over are short and to the point yet so good they could stand alone and it's hard to pick a favorite.  <br /> <br />Makes a perfect gift for someone, anyone, going through and on the verge of giving up or giving in: The weary; the discouraged, the broken-hearted, broke financially, bankrupt in love or broke in spirit all needing a testimony- a human living story of what God did in another person's life. How We Got Over will equip you to keep the faith, stay encouraged and remind you of God's goodness and faithfulness.

As one who truly believes in mind-body-spirit connection, I have always enjoyed aromotheraphy and natural skin and hair care products, as a result, when I discovered Carol's Daughter in an issue of Essence a few years ago--I was immediately smitten. At the time, of course I had no idea that Lisa Price was the beloved Lisa..Lisa...Lisa (says Oprah), I was just extremely drawn to the quality of her homemade products and the originality of her business concept.

Life is wonderfully beautiful -- until one day, out of the blue -- the past comes back to haunt you in the worst way possible. This happens to David and Abby Treasure. <br /> <br />David has an announcement for Abby, his wife of 12 years. The results of his announcement will bring to light heartache and pain that ordinarily tear even the strongest married couple apart. Abby Treasure finds out her husband had an affair nine years ago while she was pregnant with their son. The woman David had an affair with calls him requesting a meeting. At this meeting, David finds out he has a little girl that he never knew about. Even more devastating, the little girl has leukemia and is in desperate need of a bone marrow transplant. David and his son are prime candidates as donors. <br /> <br />With extraordinary writing, Deborah Bedford delivers a novel that will move the reader emotionally and spiritually. Forgiveness and redemption are powerfully displayed as Abby comes to grips with David's betrayal and the \\"other\\" woman, whose child is dying. While this book is fictional, the themes that run througout the novel can surely encourage a real-life married couple going through heartaches in their own marriage. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Tyora Moody for The GOOD GIRL Reviewers  <br />[...]	2004-10-09

When it comes to God's will-especially in love and romance, it's very easy to become anxious and get in our own way or get ahead of God (can the church say amen?) As a result, heart break, pain and confusion ensue. But, no worries. Aisha Ford writes four distinctively different stories that true romance readers will enjoy and appreciate. It's time to take a get-a-way and take your mind off things. Missouri Gateway's is a great traveling companion. It's a nice change of pace for romance readers and readers of all genres alike. Ford is a talented, creative writer and she does not disappoint. You'll love it! <br /> <br />Reviewed by Sherna' for The GOOD GIRL Book Club [...] <br />	2004-08-19

The novel A Change is Gonna Come by Jacquelin Thomas started my Christmas break as I patiently prepared to endure a fourteen-hour drive down south. This book gave me a place to disappear, and also prevented me from sheer boredom as I typically watch the trees and road signs go by. The story was simple and easy to read. I felt like I was on staff at St. Paul Human Services where the novel was set. Each character in the book made me think about my life and the decisions I have made. Ms. Thomas did a great job of bringing the people alive in the story. I was able to get to know the characters and gain insight into their lives. <br />A Change is Gonna Come reminded me of how human we all are and how we all make mistakes or &quot;fall short.&quot; This book made me realize the only thing that redeems us is each other. As we forgive each other, it makes us better in the end. For me a sign of a good book is determined by how I feel when I finish reading it. Do the characters stay with me? Every now and again, I think of how Cordelia, Sabrina, Tangie and Bonnie Mae are doing. I wonder where they are now. <br />I am pleased to recommend A Change is Gonna come for when you have a free weekend and you want to travel to a small town in North Carolina, work at St. Paul Human Services and meet four great and aspiring women who will change your life while they change theirs, as well as each others. You will not be able to put this book down!<br />Reviewer: Alexandria Taylor for [...] The GOOD GIRL Book Club	2004-03-17

The Proverbs 31 woman is the proverbial standard that most women strive to be - yet sometimes secretly cringe at how far they have to go to meet the standard. What about the mate to this awesome woman of God? Is he just hiding out under her shadow? Or is he the leader, protector and provider who \\"has got it going on\\" - if so, how did he get there? <BR>In Search of the Proverbs 31 Man: The One God Approves and Women Want (WaterBrook) is the synopsis of what author Michelle McKinney found in her search of the scriptures. Her lyrical writing style digs into God's Word to see what the Proverbs 31 man had to do in order to nab the Proverbs 31 woman. Which came first the chicken or the egg? To Hammond, it doesn't matter. She writes to men and women, single and married encouraging them to reflect the image of God.  <BR>\\"There are many dimensions of man that must be developed in order for him to become the extraordinary man whom every woman seeks and whom God smiles upon,\\" says Hammond. In Search The Proverbs 31 Man affirms the God-like qualities men aspire to have: integrity, purpose, faithfulness, diligence, kindness, wisdom and an intimate relationship with God - and makes it all so simple and achievable. This book also helps women understand their role in the process. For women, this book is like the companion to Hammond's other book, The Power of Femininity. For men, it's like a constant faith builder and blueprint for successful relationships. <BR> <BR>***** Submitted by Pamela Perry  for [...] The GOOD GIRL Book Club	2004-03-17

Because sometimes we don't want to hear what God has to say and we want to do our own thing. To further complicate matters, many of us may not know how to discern God's voice at all. In addition, listening for and to God, as well as obedience, is central to the believer's walk of faith.

On the contrary, she challenges the reader to face the reality experienced by a child when they are discarded by their parents and unwanted by their family. Although this talented author vividly depicted her life for all to read, I dare to say that no words could ever accurately describe her journey through life. I struggled to finish this book due to the realism and authenticity that Somebody's Someone represented.

The author's portrayal of the characters is very convincing and leaves the reader uncertain of the possible twists involved with further reading. Haley created a few note worthy characters in supportive roles along side the main character Courtney that really helped to add life to the story line. There were many touching moments of sisterhood and good advice between the female characters and there were moments that have you doubled over laughing while reading this book. Although I thought this book was entertaining, I did not like the additional surprise piece at the end for one of the characters. As a reader who may struggle with the idea of an interracial relationship, it almost forces one to \\"accept\\" the relationship simply by default. I would have enjoyed the book even more if I were left to struggle with my own thoughts and new insight concerning love and race. I did, however, appreciate the unrelenting faith Sebastian had for God and his desire to serve Him.

Author Stephanie Perry Moore did a magnificent job capturing the struggles of what it means to have faith in God. This book is so captivating that it was difficult to put down.  Moore allows the reader to experience the same range of thoughts and emotions that accompany us when we attempt to compromise or rob God instead of allowing His will to be done. This book is real, it does not sugar coat, gloss over or mask the natural needs and desires we have as Christian women.  This book reveals the Christian woman's most intimate prayers and longings, even those that are not always pure.      Never have I read a book that has had such a strong male Christian character. It is easy to settle for the Christian man that just attends church on Sundays. But what about the Christian man who is sold out for Christ? What about the man who loves Christ so much that he will not allow anyone, or anything to come between his love for Christ?  It is so awesome to read of such love and devotion, and as a result, it forces you to reconsider being complacent with a partner who has simply given their life to God, but has not dedicated his life to God.  It is truly an exhilarating and secure feeling knowing that we (as women) don't have to worry about positioning ourselves or manipulating men and situations in order to find and receive love.

This book teaches the lesson of what it means when we as Christians do not have pure intentions when doing the work of the Lord's.  \\"Second Sunday\\" is also a story of forgiveness, love, old-style prayer and fervent worship.  This book illustrates that God is the director, and He is always in control behind the scenes and the schemes.  This is definitely an entertaining book about church folks!<br />Submitted by GoodGirlBookClubOnline.com reviewer, Sherna Graham	2003-07-18

That having mastered the joys and sorrows of the past can be an impetus for a rewarding future. Such wonderful storytelling prose with extra doses of inspiration--we couldnt put this down!

The story is well written and quickly draws the reader into a wonderful experience. Often times, Christian books can be a bit on the dull side (smile) but Singsation did not skip a beat by keeping it genuinely realistic but not over the top. The great thing about this novel is that a person who may have a challenging time weaning off of secular fiction will find this a wonderful transition novel that will simultanously reinforce the message of having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. In other words it's just enough juice and drama to make it a page turner but you won't have to repent after reading it. And, that my friends is not easy to do. But Singsation packed a punch!! Pick this one up fast and in a hurry. Not only will you complete it while sitting in the beauty salon on a Saturday--you will stir up a great conversation discussing the book with other patrons and then everyone will want to borrow yours! Happy Reading! Marina Woods Founder, goodgirlbookclubonline.com	2001-10-25
