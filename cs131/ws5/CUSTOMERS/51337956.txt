Expect to wander through the photographs of various roses time and time again. The beauty and color of Feinstein's choices look magnificent on the black backdrop. There is the gracefulness of a John F. Kennedy bud, the lusciousness of a Broadway bloom, the fabulous folds of a Masquerade. The Ice Berg bloom is one of my favorites.<br />  God must have created the rose to express love, because this emotion comes to mind when a rose is seen, sniffed or touched. Whether it's for yourself, your parents, your friends or your sweetheart, The Infinite Rose is a book to given and kept.	2004-06-05

What an attention-grabbing effect for the kids to enjoy as they gaze at the home-style illustrations.<br />  Critter Love is a book that tells kids to be kind to critters. No matter what kind--wild and tame--or what size--big or little. There are drawings of elephants, alligators, giraffes, turtles, sheep, dogs, cats and even a porpoise or two.<br />  I'm not sure if the author meant it to be, but this is an entertaining tool for the youngest school-aged child in the family. With the colorful illustrations and simple wording, it teaches them at a young age to respect animals. The pages are thick for easy handling and extra wide to hold the fun illustrations.	2004-06-05

Luke continues to visit her. Is he driven by sympathy for Blair's condition or is it guilt for the fame and money he made writing about her high school tragedy? As with all the men Blair meets, she takes Luke to bed. Blair is casual with the sex, alcohol and drugs -- no limits, no attachments -- yet she is offended when Luke's wife returns.

After the last book I read on this subject, I swore to would avoid them at all costs. But the title and the cover of _Good Grief_ intrigued me. I popped in the first CD and was immediately enchanted by actress Amanda Foreman's voice portraying Sophie Staton -- Sophie who is working through her grief. Married three years, she spent the last one caring for a dying husband. Sophie handles widowhood by accommodating her mother-in-law, her boss, the pottery class, the book club, the Audubon club, and even her real estate agent. But things really fall apart when Sophie shows up at work in her bath robe and replaces her business mail with a potted plant. The last time Sophie fell apart, she drove through her garage door and ended up in grief counseling. So, maybe it's time to move on, start anew, and maybe she'll take her late husband, Ethan, with her.<br />  _Good Grief_ is not the typical, depressing read about loss and recovery. Sophie is funny and heartbreaking. The dialogue flows, and the author's penned images are clear. Readers will experience Sophie's sadness, chaos, humor, and her moments of clarity. The secondary characters are sometimes quirky, but all are likable. The book is engaging, amusing, and touching. Word of mouth will make _Good Grief_ a Best Seller.

Like a hawk, he takes to the night with Aileen.<br />  _The Warrior_ is one of your better romances. Readers can expect an absorbing tale that isn't weighed down with superfluous characters or facts. Delacroix focuses on the main and secondary characters important to the storyline. Don't get me wrong, the historical features of the storyline are well executed -- goodness knows, Delacroix is known for her medieval romances -- but it's the characters that breathe life into _The Warrior_ and make the reader care.<br />  _The Warrior_ maybe the last of a trilogy, but it reads as a stand alone romance.

Although this is a first for me, the idea isn't as silly as it sounds, and I'll tell you why. _Animals Inc._ is comprehensive in its business advice. The author shares some grounded, intelligent wisdom on morale and performance, as the cover mentions, but it also shows us the \\"right way\\" to use the fundamentals we learn about running a business. Through this entertaining concept the information and advice is easy to comprehend. By the time I got to the second Audio CD, I realized Animals Inc. would be perfect for junior high, high school, and even college entrepreneur/business classes. Not because it has animals in it, but because it's straightforward and entertaining, and has a strong chance of keeping the students' attention.	2004-06-04

Basically, Write Away is about Elizabeth George, the writer. Her chapters address the same subjects on the craft as other writing books, but the emphasis is on her writing style and beliefs.<br />  She starts off by telling us she believes the fundamentals of fiction can be taught. Although writing can be taught, art, passion and discipline cannot. The lessons begin with an overview of \\"the craft.\\" George's teachings cover characters, settings, landscape and plotting. She then moves to \\"The Basics,\\" which are plotting, moving on from an idea, decisions, viewpoint, voice, dialogue, the scene, and wrapping up the loose ends about the craft, such as suspense. Part four is about the process, and part five offers \\"Examples and Guides.\\" Like other writing books, George includes writing examples by famous authors, as well as many from her books.<br />  Like Stephen King's _On Writing_, which was praised as a memoir with writing lesson, George's _Write Away_ has its place on the how-to shelf. There are things novice writers can glean from writing books by popular authors like George and King. What I like most about them is that they appeal to those who would most likely never attempt to write, but do because they picked up a book on writing by their favorite author.	2004-06-04

Sedaris creates childhood scenes of rebellion, love, misunderstanding, and more among families and friends. Through description, witty dialogue, and dry humor, the author reveals a distinctive view of growing up in middle class America. Some may consider it a literary version of TV's \\"Malcom in the Middle\\" -- childhood dilemmas and a child's lucid observations about immature grownups.<br />  Three stories stand out to me. In \\"Let it Snow,\\" a mom locks the rowdy kids out during a snow day. \\"The Ship Shape\\" shows kids watching the promise of a summer home shrink day by day. And the dad in \\"Full House\\" forces his son to join a slumber party, and the son realizes just how different he really is from the neighborhood jocks.<br />  David Sedaris reads the audio version of his book.

Every great once in a while I come across a book meant for the big screen. _The Zero Game_ has what it takes - action, suspense, compelling characters, and best of all, an exceptional plot packed with some striking, fascinating twists.<br />  Matthew and Harris have been friends since college. The friendship is strong, even though the two are opposite in personalities: Matthew is a follower, whereas Harris, the son of a barber, is a born leader with the gift of gab. These two senior staffers have some humorous stories to share, but the most interesting Harris has saved for the right moment. Matthew is bored and dissatisfied by his job. Harris tells him about the Zero Game and talks him into joining him. Each person is allowed to invite only one other person. No one is allowed to know who is leading the bet or those joining in on the bet. It's as blind as betting can get. The subject of betting is whether or not one can get an unusual piece of Legislation passed. Matthew gets carried away with one particular bet, and changes the game into a life and death situation. Matthew and Harris are trapped in the game and eventually drag a young African-American Senate page into the danger after her name badge is found at a crime scene. This gal is one tough cookie and she steals the show.<br />  The first four chapters set up the story and some may find them a bit slow, but trust me, once it is over, it all becomes clear. I listened to _The Zero Game_ while working. Needless to say, I gave up because the further I got into the storyline the more I automatically stopped to listen.<br />_The Zero Game_ has the kind of heart-stopping suspense that takes your breath away.<br />  Kudos to the reader, Scott Brick, for a suspenseful listen.	2004-06-04

Brimelow begins his candid expos&eacute; on the National Education Association with a little history. The NEA, created in 1857, &quot;was&quot; a professional association concerned with &quot;standards, ethics, and educational techniques&quot; [preface]. Its original goal was improving America's education. So where did they get lost? The author tells us it was during the 1960s. The NEA morphed into a labor union, after removing school administrators from its membership and becoming competitively obsessed with the American Federation of Teachers. This was also when Kennedy issued an executive order allowing collective bargaining for federal employees, mind you, &quot;in exchange for labor union support&quot; [preface]. Because of these changes, Brimelow concludes that our educational system has been failing our children ever since.<br />  Brimelow begins with NEA's 1999 annual meeting. It reads like a political train wreck, and is the perfect start in proving his point. Throughout the book, Brimelow shows the NEA's move from reading, writing, and arithmetic to such things as self-preservation, politics, and political correctness books and class atmosphere. Brimelow names names, places blame, dishes numbers, and exposes past and present union leaders. His eye-opening facts are riveting as he relays various accounts in trying to prove the absurdity of the union's control. For example, a Connecticut Teachers Association filed a grievance demanding pay for the additional two minutes a week the union claimed teachers worked that year; a Pennsylvania association filed a grievance against the school district because coffee and doughnuts were not provided during a training day; a New York &quot;Deaf&quot; school being forced to keep teachers who couldn't sign; and a Washington local union shot down a superintendent's need to alter school starting time for special education students because some teachers would have daycare problems. It goes on and on....<br />  Brimelow doesn't dish the dirt only to leave readers wound up. The last chapter, &quot;A Twenty-four Point Wish List,&quot; is well thought out and well written. Recommendations are aimed at improving education, protecting teachers, and parents' rights -- all minus an expensive, dominating union.<br />  _The Worm in the Apple_ is the kind of book that demands reaction and hopefully causes change. Readers can expect to have a mental list of whom to share this book with before they're half way through it.oesn't dish the dirt only to leave readers wound up.

The voices of these collaborating authors are sinister, and every author is well-known in the mystery/suspense genre. But before you drop $21.95 for this book, be aware that these are not stories of murder and intrigue, but of death and misery. They are short stories with odd characters, titillating content, and startling revelations or actions. These stories reach the depths of obsession, insanity, and sin to show the deep, dark, even perverse sides of their characters, chilling readers to the core.<br />  The stories take place in America and England at various times in history, and each chapter and each life is linked to a certain charm. The first story -- an erotic tale -- shows how a bracelet is cursed. It goes on from there....<br />  _Like a Charm_ is for readers who like their stories dark, explicit, and sometimes bizarre.	2004-06-04

She does a splendid job of blending romance with suspense. The false leads are just enough to move the story along, but Roberts knows what romance readers really want--a masterfully told tale of a deeply emotional relationship. Highly recommended.	2004-06-04

Author John Feinstein tells us how Edwards eventually became the caddy for golf champion Tom Watson. Together, Watson and Edwards brought home many prestigious awards and titles.<br />  After hearing Feinstein's audio book, listeners will discover it wasn't the material things that deemed caddying worthwhile for Bruce Edwards; rather, it was his personal, as well as his professional life in the golf world. Feinstein relays Edwards' relationships, especially with Watson, to show why Edwards was held in high regard by his friends.<br />  The abridged edition goes behind the scenes of professional golf, but not in as much as the book version.

His son hates Chloe and would fight for anything left to her in the Will.<br />  Mr. Paradise likes to see Chole play cheerleader. One night, Chloe brings Kelly along. Unfortunately, for the ladies, Mr. Paradise gets generous with their company and splits them up. When two hit men arrive, expecting to find an old man having a quiet night, only to discover a cheerleader entertaining him with her pom-poms, they are not happy. The hit takes place, but isn't seen for what it was suppose to be - a home invasion. And this, folks, is just the beginning.<br />  Leading the police investigation is Detective Frank Delsa. He's suspicious about the crime scene. He has a female witness acting odd, a fast-talking bodyguard and he is attracted to the beautiful witness.<br />  Believe it or not, I've avoided Elmore Leonard's work. Being a skeptic of over-praised authors, I've dodged it for a long time, but it was the TV show Karen Sisco that changed my mind about listening to this audio book.<br />  Mr. Paradise is the first Detroit mystery for me, and I can tell you it's not for sissies. It's rated R with plenty of cringing points. Forget walking and talking tough, these characters \\"breathe\\" tough, including the women. The dialogue is short and sweet and the storyline moves quickly. Very entertaining. It's worth a second listen. Remember to use the headphones.<br />  Actor Robert Foster is the reader. He also plays Marshall Sisco on the TV show Karen Sisco. Foster is a smooth reader, and does a good job of delivering exactly what Leonard's characters are, Detroit rough.	2004-06-04

Spring Green, the side view and the multi tulip shot are my absolute favorites, and the Easter tulip reminds me of an oil painting.<br />  Tulips begin the growing season, and maybe that's why I like to think of them as a sign of renewal.

Dereck ends up investigating a case involving his brother, and this time it's the ultimate test of self-control.<br />  Frank Vaughn is an older cop investigating the hit and run of a young black boy. Vaughn and Dereck's paths eventually cross, and the two end up just a blink away from crossing a line that can't be erased. During this intense time, riots take hold of Washington at the news of Martin Luther King's assassination. The rioting backdrop is powerful.<br />  In _Hard Revolution_, vivid scenes of history intertwine with Pelecanos' story of drugs and murder. The dialogue is emotionally strong - sometimes disturbingly so - giving it the characteristics of a hard-boiled mystery. However, the story as a whole reads like historical literature. Introductions and explanations are drawn out, the police cases are slow in evolving, and at times, the rioting backdrop overwhelms the main characters' stories.<br />  Actor Lane Reddick narrates _Hard Revolution_ solo. His voice effectively carries the intensity of the storyline.<br />Brenda @ MyShelf.Com	2004-06-04

Militia-type dialogue envelops everything the characters do, including sex (\\"...intensity of their loving making unites them as a single rebel force...\\").

Green's latest thriller begins with Tom Redmond, a poor lawyer, promising to sue some large conglomerates for a poor family with an ill child. His secretary wants him to take a case that pays. Later, Tom and his friend, Mike, meet up. Mike is a special kind of friend, one willing to go the extra, unusual yard. He is also one to set up Tom in a humorous situation, just because he can. Even under stress, Tom can forgive Mike for his tricks, which signifies their special friendship. This is the kind of friendship Tom needs when life gets dangerous. The camaraderie of these two keeps the story moving once the action begins.<br />  The other person in Tom's life is his daughter, Jane. Jane is a Washington, DC, journalist. She uncovers a story about a corrupt senator, the very senator who destroyed her father's career years ago. Jane's investigative skills put her in harm's way, and lucky for her -- though not for others -- her Dad is willing to do what's necessary to find and save his daughter's life. Jane is one tough lady and adds a lot to the storyline.<br />  Who else is in Tom's life? His late wife. Tom still sees her and heeds her advice.<br />  _The First 48_ doesn't have the intensity of Green's earlier novel, _The Fifth Angel_, but it does have a suspenseful plot, blow-by-blow scenes and interesting twists. Green gives his readers a world of reality with some added embellishments -- perfect for the reader looking for an engaging thriller.<br />  Actor Stephen Lang reads _The First 48_. Lang's uses his voice well in portraying the typical emotional range, and when Lang's tone drops an octave, he invokes shades of the more sinister, from ornery to bone chilling.	2004-06-04

It's the balance one needs to be strong and truly happy, setting him or her apart from others. Seeking God's Will instead of one's own is one of the subjects Meyers discusses. She also points out that one doesn't need signs on how to behave as a Christian, because God writes it upon the heart. Obey His word, walk in the spirit, and it will all come naturally. Meyers believes Christians should stop taking themselves so seriously and have a little fun by enjoying life and enjoying their relationship with God.<br />  Meyers' teachings can be very direct - outspoken even -- but never at the expense of others. It took years of trials and tribulations for Joyce to learn the truths she generously shares in this book. Her advice is clear and, more importantly, backed up by scripture -- as the church folks would say: It's an &quot;Amen&quot; or &quot;Oh Me&quot; kind of book.	2004-06-04

When the time came to create a garden at her new home, Sorin went to special lengths for her garden and it eventually lead her to a new career in garden design. The lessons learned during her career change are what _Digging Deep_ is all about.<br />  Sorin's book is set up in six sections.<br />  \\"Six stages of \\"creative unfolding within the context of your garden: Imagining, Envisioning, Planning, Planting, Tending, Enjoying, and Completing.\\"<br />  In the stages are mini chapters of creative lessons. Sorin gives examples by way of her experiences with her clients. She tells of her clients' excitement in discovering a creative approach to life, in the hopes that it will inspire the reader. At the end of the chapters, she gives readers things to do. They aren't demanding and some may even become nice habits.<br />  _Digging Deep_ is an inspiring self-help book that uses gardening as a metaphor. The book is well written and Sorin's advice is rational and clear. Highly Recommended.	2004-06-04

The colors contrast beautifully against the black background. It's as breathtaking as the publisher claims, and more. Sydney Eddison's introduction, \\"A Bee's Eye View,\\" leads readers into the photographs and in the essay, \\"Engendered is the Flower,\\" A. D. Coleman talks symmetry, comparing Feinstein and Chaucer in the timing of their work.<br />  With each section there is a 3- to 6-page piece about the flowers in the photographs (White Flowers, Roses, Pansies, Poppies, Orchids, Irises, Sunflowers and Dandelions, Cosmos and Daisies, Floral Diversity, A Name for Every Flower). Some of the photos remind me of drawings in pastel oils, such as the doubled-flowered evergreen azalea on page 105, the bouquet of pink evergreen azaleas on page 107, and the large picture of a modern rose on 32-33. I can only imagine the modern rose photo hanging on my office wall. Absolutely beautiful.<br />  This book is huge. Place it on your coffee table and company will naturally gravitate to it. Any cultivator or artist will appreciate its ability to bring the conversation around to nature and art. My first thought was my daughter and her drawing class. This book can inspire many ways of sharing it. Be sure to look up all Feinstein's floral books. They are well worth the effort.	2004-06-04

Bailey continues to write true crime articles for Gloss magazine. Only now she is her own source. Bailey has become an amateur sleuth, and she is about to go to work once again. When fellow bridesmaid Ashley Hanes calls Bailey, months after the wedding, Bailey figures she wants a favor. She does. In a way. Ashley is calling about the recent deaths of two women. It just so happens they were bridesmaids with Ashley and Bailey at a spring wedding. Suddenly Bailey sees this favor in a whole new light - a self-serving, life-saving light.<br />  Bailey heads to Greenwich to investigate the deaths. She eventually ends up with a third body and a couple of her own scary moments. The local police think she's screwy and the Greenwich population is... well... different. Bailey is sooo ready to figure this out and go home.<br />  This is the third Bailey Weggins mystery. Bailey's character has grown in wit and wisdom since the series debut, \\"If Looks Could Kill.\\" This mystery is mildly complex, and the storyline, as a whole, enjoyable. The characters in Bailey's high society world are still as exasperating as ever. And Baileyette's (series followers) will enjoy Bailey's \\"will she, won't she\\" behavior with her latest love interest. It's an amusing series for the light-hearted reader who welcomes a good dose of dry humor in their mystery.<br />  If you haven`t listened to this series on audio book then you haven't met Bailey. Actress Kate Walsh is Bailey and those sarcastic, witty moments are some of her best reading scenes.	2004-06-04

DI Annie Cabbot isn't feeling well, but arrives at the crime scene like a trooper. There she finds two burnt barges and Inspector Alan Banks. Annie and Banks have a history, but are now involved with other people. Despite their past, their respect for each other keeps their present relationship civilized.<br />  The detectives have a double homicide. The woman was a drug addict and the man, an artist. At the scene Banks spies someone in the woods, watching. They catch Mark and learn that he lived with the drug addict, Tina. Mark's love for Tina seems real, and Banks takes pity on him. Throughout the storyline, Mark chases his own demons, and readers learn of his and Tina's sad stories.<br />  Banks is determined to solve this one. Suspects and clues move into place, only to be shifted in the wind and smoke of a burnt caravan and a new victim. Cabbot heads in one direction and Banks in another. Hopefully their paths will meet up and solve this before another homeless person succumbs to the arson's match.<br />  _Playing with Fire_ is number fourteen in the Banks series. It doesn't have the calculated, coldness of _Aftermath_, but the storyline is complex, nonetheless. Readers will be just as surprised at the shocking conclusion as Banks, Cabbot and the Yorkshire Police.<br />  Robinson pushes the envelope in his series. His characters go from one extreme to the other, and there isn't a subject too sacred to be drawn on. Robinson's Inspector Banks series rivals Dexter's Inspector Morse, and that is one reason I recommend it.	2004-06-04

In _Deliver Us From Evil_, Hannity weighs in on three subjects seen in the headlines since 9/11 - terrorists, dictators, and liberalism.<br />Using written history Hannity shows how he feels the evils of dictatorship and terrorism reached our shores. He more or less lays the blame on past leaders.<br />  The written facts and history are enlightening, not to mention informative.

This isn't about fiction, but nonfiction. In two days, I've listened to this audio tape four times. The simplicity of Zinsser's advice is refreshing.<br />  When I pick up a pen, I always remind myself to keep it simple and say it in as few words a possible. That's pretty much Zinsser's advice. He also believes one who thinks clearly should be able to write clearly. Words are tools. Learn to use the language (tool) \\"simply and warmly\\" and you can write, too. He also warns that writing is not easy. A good writer writes and rewrites. Zinsser reminds us that writing is not a contest between writers, but a transaction between the writer and the reader.<br />\\"My four principles are: Clarity, Simplicity, Brevity and Humanity. If you keep those four principles in mind, there's almost nothing you can't do.\\"<br />  Zinsser goes over the four principles and more. Each subject is to the point--as Zinsser's says, \\"Life is too short.\\"<br />  Zinsser gives his readers plenty of wisdom--too much to put in one review. Any writer who takes his own work seriously and wants others to as well should buy the book or audio tape and keep it handy.	2004-06-04

In Regency London, on a darkened street, widow Lydia Westin is threatened and gallant Captain Lacey comes to her rescue. When he takes her home, widow Westin attempts to seduce him in her gratitude. She then learns what series readers have come to know: that the captain is an honorable, haunted man. When Lacey learns of the widow's plight - her husband was murdered - he takes up her cause. The good widow believes her husband was killed by three men who both shamed and framed him.<br />  Mr. Grenville, a dandy to rival Beau Brummell, is attending a house party in Kent. The three officers suspected will also be at the house party. Grenville slips Lacey into this aristocratic house party, and together the two try to solve Westin's murder and clear his good name.<br />  A Regimental Murder is a complicated mystery and Lacey is unusually stuffy for a Captain. Mr. Grenville is entertaining, but the rest of the aristocratic society seems beyond redemption. _A Regimental Murder_ is written in first person and comes across in typical regency form.	2004-06-04

Sadie wants others to see Winnie Churchill, like she did. And Violet wants Martin to ?just see.?<br />  Major Earl and Lady Compton eventually do spend more time together, but mostly due to the deaths of four American servicemen. Everyone at Sitting Marsh can feel the animosity building between the Brit and US soldiers. The Americans are based at Sitting Marsh for England?s protection, but some resent their occupation. Tense moments, pranks, and fights are expected, but not four murders in a row. Lady E., feeling responsible for the actions of Sitting Marsh, investigates the deaths and comes up with the possible conclusions.<br />  The folks at Sitting Marsh and the Manor are feeling love struck, spooked, some what muddled, and definitely temperamental. Only Lady E., with the comfort and guidance of the Major, can keep them on track. But for how long? Lady E. maybe responsible and generous, but she also has feelings. And right now her emotions are quietly wrapped up in one man, who gives her some startling news once the mystery is solved.<br />  _Berried Alive_ is mystery number six. Clues are scattered throughout; the twists are as curvy as Sitting Marsh?s dirt roads, and the surprise conclusion is well hidden.

Each time they have a house party, a house guest is murdered. The rumor stems from the Eighth Earl and the words of an angry gypsy. Curse or not, having guests in Alderley, his 17th-century county home, is far from the Earl's mind, until Aunt Florrie dies. With the funeral taking place on the property, the lawyer requests the use of Alderley to read the will. Much against the Earl's approval, a will reading turns into a stayover, and soon, a murder.<br />  Aunt Florrie likes talking about her funeral plans with her companion, Jean. She has changed her will and knows her time is most likely near; after all, she's ninety-six. Florrie promises that everyone will be remembered in her will, in some way or another. Florrie also warns Jean not to conjure her up in a s&eacute;ance . . . although she believes it wouldn't take one for her to reappear at Alderley. It was one of the most exciting places she's visited. Someone who does reappear at Alderley is Detective Chief Inspector Wilkins, once a victim is found.<br />  Anderson seems to be a perfectionist when it comes to setting up a mystery. In the first nine chapters, family members are brought up by the aunt, then the reader is updated on each member's life. It's an entertaining overview of Florrie's relatives, and just the beginning of the layers and twists.<br />  I read and enjoyed Anderson's last two British mysteries. They were hard to solve and carried that wonderful 1930's flair. Anderson has a wonderful gift of conjuring up the Thirties era in his characters and their surroundings. However, for me, The _Affair of the 39 Cufflinks_ didn't quite have that locked-door effect that Anderson's first two mysteries did, but the mystery was still complicated enough. _The Affair of the 39 Cufflinks_ is definitely another entertaining read. I highly recommended it, as well as _The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cozy_ and _The Affair of the Mutilated Mink_.<br />Brenda @ MyShelf.Combr />Brenda @ MyShelf.Com	2004-06-04

Alexandra Anderon-Spivy's essay, \\"The Architecture of Nature Enhanced,\\" discusses Feinstein's use of the computer in his images, his talent, and man's love of nature. The rest of the book contains a combination of photographs and such things as poetry, plant names, and famous quotes. There is something informative or inspiring to go with each photograph. Each section is labeled to let the reader know what is in it (Grasses and Ferns, Edibles, The Essence of Green, The Beneficial Green Plant). Feinstein's grasses look picturesque and proud; his vegetables lined and curved and his various greens sharp and eclectic. My favorites are the Hosta leaves (pg 90) and the poppy flower buds (pg 94).<br />  If you are wondering about the expense of the book, consider the artistic value of the photographs printed on strong, waterproof material.

Although the Word may not be prominent in all his work, it's obvious that it's a moral ground from which he speaks. His political view is Conservative and will most likely rile his dedicated opponents, but they, in turn, will have to admit he writes with respect and honesty.

Although this one can be considered a stand-alone mystery, the main character Hawkman makes this a series worthy of backtracking. He has the typical private investigator traits -- skepticism and curiosity, but he's also loyal, intelligent, and compassionate.<br /><br />Richard lives with his mother far away from the hubbub of the city. He's home schooled and socializing is pretty much nonexistence. After a ride on his cycle, Richard comes home to discover his mother and dog murdered on the kitchen floor. The scene is emotionally gripping, especially since seventeen-year-old Richard is deaf with no one to turn to. His parents' past loving guidance gives him wisdom to get through the crisis, and his pain gives him the courage to investigate his mother's murder on his own. When Hawkman becomes aware of the circumstances he takes up the deaf teen's cause, doing everything possible to keep the state and the police from taking him into custody.<br /><br />La Pierre writes her deaf characters as lip readers with the ability to speak instead of using sign language. The influence of this choice comes from the BS degree in Speech Therapy she received from the Oklahoma College for Women -- now known as University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma. In the OCW college town was the well-known oral deaf school, Jane Brooks School for the Deaf.<br /><br />The Silent Scream is a clean, gripping mystery with a haunting lead character. The storyline moves smooth and quick. It's a read you won't forget it anytime soon. The three titles in the Hawkman series are The Enemy Stalks, Double Trouble, and The Silent Scream.	2001-11-03

There is nothing charming or romantic about the lives shared with us in this story. Lalita Tademy has written a compelling story, part fact and part fiction, about her family roots. It begins at Cane River, Louisiana, in 1834 with Suzette, who also fills us in on her mother's life as a slave in Virginia years before that<br />Slaves Elisabeth and Gerasime have four children; Suzette is one. The opening chapter falls upon Suzette, as she is getting back at Madame Derbanne for slapping her; already the sign of what's to come. In present day, Derbanne is a well-known name in the south. The author's family, with the exception of Elizabeth, began on Derbanne's Creole plantation. Suzette hopes to wed a free black man, but learns the free do not wed slaves and fate has an unwilling course ahead for her. Her brief glimpse of freedom is just the beginning for this family with no last name.  Suzette falls victim to a French man and gives birth to Philomene. Philomene is enamored with freedom and blessed with visions. Philomene lives two lives and gives birth to Emily who experiences more freedom than the rest, but it eludes her in a new way.	2001-08-17

Rereading it as a grown-up was a magical experience.<br />Although I see nothing wrong with the Disney adaptation of Peter Pan, I am glad to see the original version back in fresh print.

It takes place in London and Paris just before the French Revolution. The sleuth is Anne Cartier, a vaudeville actress training to be a deaf teacher at two, soon to be famous, deaf schools. Colonel Paul de Saint-Martin of the royal highway patrol is sent by his aunt to find Anne and give her the sad news that her stepfather is dead. He lets Anne help in finding the truth about her stepfather's death by pairing her up with Georges Charpentier, who goes undercover. It's a story of politics, trickery, adversity and emotional awakening.<br />The era itself is captivating and romantic; Mr. O'Brien successfully enriches it with full-bodied characters and a multifaceted mystery of twists and turns. I found Mute Witness to be a lengthy, sound read. It is an impressive story to be read and enjoyed a bit at a time in order to make the experience last.	2001-05-24

Craig Rice: The Queen of Screwball Mystery	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Reviewed by Jo Rogers at MyShelf.com	WHO WAS THAT LADY? marks the first real effort to unravel the myths surrounding the life of comedy mystery writer, Craig Rice.  She was tops in the genre at making murder funny, and her chief rival during her career was none other than the grande dame of mystery, Agatha Christie. But little was known about Rice herself, and what was known were conflicting stories told by Rice.  It seemed as though she didn't want anyone to know her story.  So, who was this comic genius who made crime funny?  That is what Jeffrey Marks set out to learn.  Jeffery Marks does a superb job of telling us her real story, and of tracking down the truth, separating fact from fiction. It was no small chore.  He found himself following a trail that took him from New York to Los Angeles and even into Mexico as he tried to find people who knew the real Craig Rice.  Though many of her friends were gone, her children had records of her work and letters from friends, agents and publishers.  These revealed the tragic story of a genius who was also a bipolar manic depressive.  In her day, the only treatment for the disease was shock therapy or a lobotomy, either of which would have destroyed her career.  Sadly, much of Rice's work is out of print.  Perhaps, if enough of us mystery lovers read WHO WAS THAT LADY?, publishers will revive her work and restore to the reading public a comic genius too long missing from the bookshelves of America.  Readers, how about it?	2001-04-04

In picking up a copy of The Birth of Blue Satan, one can sense the strength of the story by the size, the attractive cover, and the book jacket information. In opening the book, one will find a solid, impressive beginning to a history mystery that could very well be the lead of a classic series. Am I exaggerating? Not at all. Patricia Wynn is coming into the historical mystery genre as a well-established author, and it shows in the strong plot, fully developed characters, and historical details.<br />It's 1715 in England, when politics and parties are a matter of life or death for rich and poor alike, as Gideon Viscount St. Mars discovers through his father, Earl of Hawkhurst.

Wow, time flies when you enjoy a series. This sixth edition involves a pretty good mystery, a marriage of convenience, revenge, time travel, and friendship willing to go the illegal distance.<br />I could hardly believe the blurb that came with the book saying Brenda married her ex-boyfriend's slim ball agent Lemmy Crenshaw, but it looks like it's true, and knowing Brenda, there's one heck of a story behind it. It seems Lemmy came to Brenda with a problem. She agreed to help out under certain conditions. When off and on love interest Johnny Verlone finds out, he reveals all creating a vengeful mad hatter. Brenda's anger and frustration at being tricked is apparent in her language and demeanor, a perfect mood for revenge certain to backfire. To get back at Lemmy, Brenda becomes a bra napper, and just her luck, in mid-revenge, she becomes a possible murder witness. During the mystery, her relationship with Johnny spins like a whirling derby with so many breaks up in one storyline that it's dizzying.<br />The same familiar characters return with Brenda. Elizabeth, her neighbor and friend, Ralph, her doorman and protector, Chuck Rily, who has this time travel thing going on, and of course Dweena who wouldn't dare be left out of the action, illegal or otherwise. It's amazing what one will do for those one associates with, especially in acts of revenge. It certainly makes for great entertainment, and readers will be entertained with Brenda and her cohorts' revenge until about chapter eleven when the mystery begins. Brenda turns to Detective's Turner and McKinley who have to deal with a department problem named Duxman. The characters personal lives and the mystery play well simultaneously. The murder mystery, with some great light moments, is pretty impressive. The turns fooled me, and the murderer revealed took me by surprise. Ms. Wilson has a great sense of humor and it shows - even through Brenda's intense moments. It's a fun series.	2001-03-21

If he wanted to be part of the gang he had to climb the tree, get in the house, grab Mrs. Nordling's show cat, and get out. He wants to belong somewhere so he takes his chances. What Robin experiences, no child should. During the unpleasant scene he rescues the cat, but ends up a witness to murder. He doesn't go to the police, but he does hide the cat. He deals with some unsavory people, including relatives. The murderer knows there was a witness; he chased him out of the house. Through the storyline he deals with covering the murder, finding the cat and the witness, and keeping a nosy neighbor at bay.<br />Readers will know who the murderer is so there is no sleuth or mystery to solve; in fact the police don't play an active part in it, although they are mentioned. Being only 189 pages, it reads as a quick suspenseful story where the author takes the reader back and forth between Robin with his family and the murderer.  Robin's life is heart wrenching, and although the path to which he got the cat was not good, having her in his life just might be.	2001-03-21

Bubbles, who also explains her name, works at Sandy's House of Beauty and ends up back at school, which leads her to a story, which leads her to a hunky photographer, who leads her to a body, which starts a dangerous conflict between the rich and the poor of Lehigh, PA.

When Bubbles takes on The Metzgers of Lehigh Steel, she stirs up enough trouble to put her home at risk, but not to worry; Her polish mama is at the ready.  Humor and great characters isn't all Sara Strohmeyer has to offer. The mystery is well planned; only straying to the characters' personal lives when it blends in with the story line, whodunit is successfully guarded held until the end, and at the conclusion of each chapter is a beauty recipe.	2001-03-21

The author includes some interesting information in her mystery about flying, doctoring, and the benefits of being rich.<br />The Beckmann family, Albert, Grace, the boys, and the housekeeper Millie are back for their second mystery. Grace  and the twins are out for a Sunday fly to the Carlsbad Caverns with Albert in his new Piper Turbo Arrow. Albert is a doctor, and his family is well off, so they can enjoy such perks, but there's nothing enjoyable about finding the owner, James Delacroix, of a FBO dead on top of his yearly new Cadillac, especially since they had seen him very much alive not long ago. What makes it worse is that his daughter is Albert's chief nurse at his medical service.  After they discover the body, they are asked to stay in the neighboring town of Copper Creek with Delacroix's girlfriend for the night. When Delacroix's daughter Arlene hears about the murder, having no faith in baby-faced sheriff, Tim, she asks Albert and Grace to investigate it.  Grace is excited at the prospect. Albert helps out, and so do many others in the mystery, including their son Spence who doesn't want to go to college and is a natural sleuth just like his mother. Suspects and theories begin to form. Everyone in their hometown and in Copper Creek are aware that they are investigating, which leads to some hot and dangerous moments.<br />Jackie Lewin uses the first couple of chapters to introduce the family and their lifestyle.

As in her last series, Ms. Kingsbury's new series is considered a cozy, and, in some corners, a historical mystery as well. A Bicycle Built for Murder is the first in the series.<br />The Manor House seaside village is called Sitting Marsh. It's World War II, a time of bombing, blackouts, rationing, and American soldiers on British soil. The main character Lady Elizabeth Hartleigh Compton is thirty-one and divorced. She inherited a Jacobean mansion, cottages, and vast acres after her parents were killed. She cares for her tenants beyond what is expected and proves it when a mother asks her to investigate the disappearance of her wayward daughter. When a disappearance turns to murder, Lady Elizabeth, with the approval of the local law, takes on the formidable task of listing suspects and clues to find out what happened to sixteen-year-old Beryl Pierce. After adding amateur sleuth to her list of obligations, Lady Elizabeth discovers she can add Hostess as well when a handsome major arrives to tell her American officers will be moving into her manor.<br />A Bicycle Built for Murder is expertly written.. The mystery stays in the front position with character introductions and long-term secondary plots blending in. The historical details and dialogue add to the intrigue. The main secondary characters are the manor house staff, Violet, Martin, and Polly. They provide some light moments in the mystery, and if first impressions are anything to go by, I can honestly say they will effectively help to carry the series. A Bicycle Built for Murder is an engaging read of murder and mayhem that takes place in a time far from forgotten.	2001-02-10

The place is Bologna, Italy. The year is 1489. Avisa Boylatoni and Lucia Colascco, the only female locksmiths the Street of Guilds, are the main characters.  Together they attend meetings at the Guild Hall, work their crafts, and solve mysteries. Others who join in the mystery are Avisa's apprentice and an injured solider.<br />The Duke and Duchess arrive back in town with some extra company. The Duchess brings with her a poor relation who pursues not a man, but a professional skill for her future. The Duke allows a gentleman, who will cast the perfect bells for Bologna, collect the silver from the people. When the Duke's best solider is killed and the silver is taken, Avisa's fear of being sucked into the intrigue of the rulers is brought to life. She and her locksmith skills maybe the only way to protect those she cares most about.<br />It takes all kinds to make a fascinating sub-genre and Ms. Cooper is doing her part in historical mysteries. I found the historical atmosphere intriguing and simple, and the characters perfectly imperfect, which makes them more believable. As the characters are introduced and settle into their places, I am captivated by the subject matter and settle myself into the fact that this is a winning new series with a very interesting amateur sleuth as lead character. I liked the way the story ended with \\"and this is just the beginning feeling\\". Look for Key Confrontations and Key Confessions coming soon from M.E. Cooper and Padlock Mystery Press.	2001-02-10

White Knight, White Magic, and White Heather are the first three in the series that travels the misty western isles of Scotland. Jaclyn Reding is known for her historical romances. Her books take the reader to a far and distant land for a time of intrigue and romantic celebration. It's a wonderful opportunity that all romance readers should endeavor to experience.<br />In the prologue, we are introduced to Lady Eleanor Wycliffe, heiress of the Westover dukedom. It's September 1820 and things aren't going the way Lady Eleanor had hoped so she decides to leave home. She ends up at the Isle of Trelay in the Scottish Hebrides and takes on the job as governess for Gabriel MacFeagh, Viscount Dunevin. His daughter experienced a tragedy three years ago and hasn't spoken since. Nor has the devil of Dunevin, as he is known, shown any affection or support for the child or her condition. Mystifying reasoning is the cause of all this mayhem in the Dunevin castle, and hopefully the concerns of one wayward, unhappy woman, who instantly feels emotionally attached, can set them all to rights.<br />White Mist is an inspiring read. Sometimes it takes getting away from an everyday routine and existence to really witness life. This is what Eleanor does, and it leads her to a child in need of support and a man most clearly misunderstood... or is he? It also leads her to emotions she has yet to experience or understand, and most likely would not have discovered at home. The characters are well developed, compassionate, and sooo romantic. The historical setting with the Gaelic information is sound and impressive: I enjoyed learning from it. I found it to be a wonderful read and am quite sure fellow historical romance readers will love the fourth title in the White Series.	2001-02-10

Death and the Hubcap is Linda Berry's second Trudy Roundtree/Ogeechee mystery. Her first, Death and the Easter Bunny, was a memorable debut into policewoman Trudy Roundtree's small-town life. It looks like Berry's second literary excursion to Ogeechee is just as unforgettable. When reading Death and the Hubcap, my sudden snickers and bursts of laughter had those in the room curious, so I read parts of the mystery aloud and had others laughing with me. That's why I'm so sure it's a read everyone will enjoy.<br />Police Chief Hen Huckabee sends his niece and newest officer on another eccentric Ogeechee police call. Something Trudy is becoming an expert at. This time it's the town oddball, Tanner. Tanner's idea of driving is his two feet pacing and a hubcap for a steering wheel. He claims to have backed over a body. Knowing him and the impossibility of it, Trudy figures to play it out like she has in the past, that is until she finds a body with a tire mark on it. The humor used in the scenes with Tanner and Trudy is priceless. The way the new characters and suspects are introduced is well done, no confusion here. Towards the end, Berry has Trudy going over the suspects. Each paragraph reminds the reader of a suspect and possible motive. Being a series mystery, town business and family life forges ahead for Trudy and the Ogeechee citizens. It's a pleasant blend, and doesn't take away from the mystery at all.<br />Death and the Hubcap is rare mystery treat. It's good, clean fun with all the small town trappings and quirky characters that make a mystery of this caliber complete. One of the things that impressed me was the lack of spoilers when referring to the first mystery. Although Trudy goes over her past and makes a brief mention of her last case, none can be considered spoilers because they give nothing away. Trudy's first person perspective is used to tell the story in a casual, amusing way, and it works. These characters are unique; don't expect razor sharp wits that slice and dice with wickedness, or any small town mockery or fellow character assignations; it's not here. Shortcomings of the town and some characters are pointed out in a light, humorous way that makes this series all the more endearing to me. Do expect a well-paced whodunit to keep you guessing, and a laugh out loud story line to keep you in stitches.hat slice and dice with wickedness, or any small town mockery or fellow character assignations; it's not here.

The first three are The Cove, The Maze, and The Target. In this one, FBI agents and good friends, Mac, Sherlock, and Sherlock's husband Savich are back together again.  Mac, who was introduced in Coulter's The Maze, is back. He is in the hospital recovering from a car bombing. On the light side, he is already making demands of the nurse who is also a friend, and on the serious side, he just had a bad dream that he and his sister, Jilly, drove over a cliff. The bad dream goes with the worried feelings he had been having about her for some time, but had brushed off after talking to their brother Kevin, who felt her growing eccentricities stem from living on the west coast. Now the worry and fears for her are back and this time even stronger, especially after he calls her husband Paul, and finds she really did drive off a cliff and is now in a coma. Mac heads out to Edgerton, Oregon, also known as The Edge, as soon as he is able.  On arriving to The Edge, Mac finds his FBI credentials have preceded him and the only people who care to welcome him are the police -- Sheriff Maggie Sheffied and the Highway Patrolman who save his sister's life. After being refused a room at a B &amp; B, Mac decides to stay with the brother-in-law he barely knows. Paul and Jilly have been married eight years, and the only thing Jilly has ever told him is that Paul works in Pharmaceuticals and the sex is great. When Mac goes to visit his sister, he hears her voice in his mind yelling the name Laura. Once Mac finds her, confusion starts. To clear the confusion, Mac starts investigating on his own. Sherlock and Savich show up to help and everyone finds themselves far away from home and in serious danger.  The Edge is a pretty good suspense novel. I wouldn't call it a thriller, even though there was an edge of the seat moment or two. The author has Mac and Jilly speaking in first person. Jilly's part is in italics. The characters are strong and interesting, and the dialog and action kept the pages turning. The plot was pretty basic with one exception, but I can't tell what that is without giving away the story. I will say the storyline, language, and sexual content is for mature audiences. As for spoilers from the last three books in the series, it didn't seem as if there were any, but since I haven't read them, I couldn't say for sure.characters are strong and interesting, and the dialog and action kept the pages turning.

Sam takes the murder pretty hard and flies off to Illinois to deal with the victim's family. While he is away, Melanie plays intrepid girl sleuth and rounds up a list of suspects for his return. Just when she thinks she figured it out, another murder takes place and leaves her scratching her head.<br />I have two pure breed dogs, but I know nothing about shows or breeding. And to prove it, I never registered our dogs, the Lhasa carries a poodle cut, and the miniature schnauzer has floppy ears. They were hand-me-downs from families who didn't want them. So, in reading this mystery, I've learned a lot from the drove of dog show information blended into the mystery. It was interesting without being distracting. The mystery itself was pretty good, and although I did have it solved right away, I still enjoyed reading the storyline and enjoyed watching the lead protagonist's personal life take on some changes. Speaking of the of the protagonist, the lead characters of Melanie, Sam, Aunt Peg, and Davy are likable; their relationships are realistic without being silly or over sweet.  The sub-characters aren't left out of the action either. Each has an essential part in the mystery, whether it's to add more suspicion or to become a suspect. I sincerely think Laurien Berenson's fans will enjoy the undemanding epic called Unleashed in the Melanie series.<br />If you enjoy barking up this type of mystery tree, then you may also enjoy some similar canine mysteries by Susan Conant, Melissa Cleary, Carol Lea Benjamin, and Leslie O'Kane.ed watching the lead protagonist's personal life take on some changes.

The Little Red Buckets is a wonderful tale with all the makings of a traditional Christmas reading. The heart-warming story starts out with grandmother Jenny and her granddaughter Sarah making bread. Grandmother decides to tell a story about two red buckets and a Christmas day she has never forgotten. The story goes back to the early 1900's and to Grandma Jenny's family farm. She tells of her parents, her sister Zella, and her brother Ralph, their life on the farm, how they helped an elderly couple that lived near them, their family Christmas traditions, and one special Christmas.<br />The story flows effortlessly. The family is compassionate and memorable. The story as a whole is a memorable experience. I was so touched by story I told everyone I knew to consider it for a Christmas read. The book it's self is beautifully created with an attractive dustcover, and the small hardback edition is perfect for those small hands. It's a story for all ages and I truly believe grown ups will be just as blessed by it as the children.	2000-12-26

The mystery takes place in Constantinople during the reign of Justinian and Theodora. Two for Joy is an impressive mystery about roman courts, religion, miracles, respect, heartache, loyalty, and friendship.<br />John has his hands full when a former teacher/pagan philosopher appears unannounced at his door and wanders into trouble more than once; A trio of stylites (Holy men) simultaneously burst into flame while on their pillars; Anatolius, John's friend and secretary to the emperor, puts together a banquet for his father that turns tragic; and a Christian prophet's sermons and miracles bring both peace and chaos.<br />Christianity, Paganism, and Mithraism are weaved throughout this roman mystery. Ecliptic, colorful characters fill the pages - some returning from the first mystery. The historical details are substantial and informative without being confusing, and the added bonus is a glossary at the back.  Two for Joy maybe part of a series, but it held it's own, and references to the last mystery, One For Sorrow, did not read as spoilers.<br />In starting Two for Joy, I found there was no stopping. The intriguing mystery, genuine characters, and historical quality captivated me. Two for Joy is a historical whodunit that will keep its readers in place until the last page is turned.	2000-12-26

Nelson is blessed with the true gift of story telling. After reading \\"The Little Red Buckets\\", I decided to try \\"My Master's Touch\\". I knew the story was about a burro named Meshak and his life with his master's family. What I didn't know and was greatly impressed with was how the story was handled. The author never really tells whom the burro belongs to, or what is really going on in the master's family, the story is told from the burro's perspective, and the author lets the reader piece together the scenes which lead to very emotional conclusions for both the master and his burro. This may be listed as a juvenile story, but don't mistake it for a cute burro tale with cute colorful pictures. The burro has a youthful, yet experienced narrator's voice, and the tale, meant for all ages, has a heart felt moral to it that the reader must discover for him or her self.  Have a box of Kleenex for this Nelson book as well.<br />The book itself is very well put together with a beautiful dustcover, and the small hardback is just right for the small hands.	2000-12-03

The first chapter tells the basics of the Christmas plants heritage and where our traditions first started. In the second chapter, we learn the history at the mistletoe and how it became Oklahoma's state flower. In the next chapter, the story of the Christmas tree, how it was used in ancient traditions. The fourth chapter explains the circle of life, or as we know it, the wreath and what it symbolizes. The next two chapters tell us about the European tradition of the Yule log and the holy holly. I found it interesting that again the Christian church condemned a plant because it was used in pagan rituals, only to later lift the ban. This little package with a big story to tell also mentions the poinsettia and it's heritage from Mexico, the rosemary and how it was used in the middle ages, the Christmas Rose, which isn't really a rose at all, cinnamon, which was native to India, Peppermint, the universal symbol of Christmas, and of course the cranberry and it's functional history.<br />What a delightful read! I came away filled with the knowledge of ancient cultures, history, and beliefs that surround the plants I put out every Christmas. Some of the Information Linda Allen provides I am aware of, but the largest percentage I was not. I will not only look at this season's plant differently, I will also share their stories with those who will listen and tell them where I learned it all.	2000-11-01

Ranch Dog is a book of essays, poetry, and pictures dedicated to the dogs of the west. I sat trying to think of who could benefit from this book. Kids were my first thought. This would be a great book for school libraries. It's also a great book for the coffee table at home or at a Dude ranch to share friends and family who love animals. The list of ideas goes on and on.<br /> Marianne starts her book out with an astounding story of a loyal herd dog left to die followed by a poem called \\"The Bath\\" also written by her. Some of the poems offered in the book are written by others and fit into the theme of the book perfectly. Expect some wonderful, informative short tales from the west. One that caught my attention was about a guard dog and an Ostrich ranch in Colorado. The author takes her readers to the western states of Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, California, Wyoming, and Nevada and treats them to many dog stories that will beg to be shared once read.<br /> In this delightful book, are plenty of pictures - one of the reasons I think it would be a great addition to libraries. They are picturesque black and whites of the dogs, their masters, and their charges at work, play, and rest. The pictures alone show how hard these animals earn their keep. They are a wonderful addition to an already inspiring book.	2000-11-01

While recovering from her last adventure, she hears her father is ill. Worried about her father and untrusting of her stepmother, Fremont decides to take a train to Boston and visit him. Although Michael Archer Kossoff, her partner and lover, is against the idea, he decides to join her. Fremont, an independent woman, has a very smart way of getting around Michael when he strongly, and I mean strongly, disagrees with her.<br />Once in Boston an old friend, William Barrett, meets her. Not liking her stepmother Augusta and not wanting to stay with her right away, they settle in the Parker House and go to visit her father who is, by then, in a hospital. Needless to say a visit home leads to tragedy and it's up to Fremont and Michael to solve it.<br />The story takes the reader through Fremont's relationship with her father, which I found touching, and her old life in Boston, which she compares to her new life. At the beginning, are the returning characters of Edna Stephenson and her son, Wish. In Boston there are some new, very interesting characters along with Fremont's father, stepmother and son. For me, the characters and the early 1900 dialect made the story.<br />As I started out the story seemed slow, but definitely picked up when they arrived in Boston, and the other characters were brought in. I solved the mystery pretty easy, but was emotional stirred and surprised by the unexpected out come.	2000-10-05

As we all know, the school disagreement of sports VS art has been handed down from generation to generation all over America, but Leslie O'Kane's mystery adds an unusual twist to the subject. School politics rears its ugly head once again, and the typical group of common folk who have become indifferent, sanctimonious, and offensive (with the exception of Molly's dad), due to the power they think their seats possess, are endanger of being toppled from their self-glorified thrones by their leader.  Molly, along with her parents, goes to a meeting knowing that the board president has threatened to expose a secret in her father's past if he doesn't agree to vote for sports. After returning from a private meeting, Sylvia Greene, the president, falls to poison in front of a crowd of parents and live on the town's local TV channel. Molly's father is being blamed. Molly learns her father's secret and decides to put her self in the way of danger, literally, to clear his name and find the real killer.<br />You gotta love the sense of humor Leslie O'Kane gives Mollie; it's laugh out loud funny. The subject of sports VS art may be an old one, but the mystery plot is fresh. The false leads kept me going, and the sub-characters are true enough that they will most likely remind you of someone you know, too.	2000-10-05

It's a humorous storyline with two very funny, very down to earth amateur sleuths. The author tells the story from Patricia Anne's point of view, with the occasional third person as well.<br />For those you who have yet to meet this hilarious southern sister duo, I will introduce you. Patricia Anne is also known as Mouse. She could be a Jeopardy contender, loves Wheel of Fortune and has been married 40 years to Fred, who greatly appreciates solid ground when he is back on it, almost to the point of embarrassment for Mary Alice. Then there's Mary Alice, who has her sister carry home something on the plane that shocks and embarrasses Patricia Anne. She is also a member of the Angel Sighting Society, widowed many times, and worried that her \\"sell by date\\" is near expiring and needs to get married this year.<br />In their latest whodunit, Patricia Anne, her husband, and Mary Alice are back in Alabama after a trip to Warsaw on a visit.  As soon as they return, a relative, who they call Pukey Lukey, calls asking for help. His wife has disappeared and he thinks she ran off with a preacher. The cousins agree to help and this takes them to Chandler Mountain where they meet a variety of characters who are so diverse in personalities that it isn't possible to confuse them. One is a sheriff who seems to cause a personality change in Mary Alice whenever he is near. Once at the church on the mountain, they find a victim. She isn't the one they are looking for, but they are still involved because Luke is seriously attacked during the visit and they have to find out why. Later another victim is found, and now things are looking frightening for Luke's wife. The sisters aren't sure who or what is causing the deaths and near tragic happenings. Did the strange things they use during the unusual church services cause it or is it the Chandler Mountain Booger?  That's something I think readers will enjoy finding out as they read Murder Carries a Torch.<br />While the mystery carries on, there is interaction with other members of the family, one being emails between Patricia Anne and her daughter-the grown and married Haley. The interaction blended well with the mystery since it was a relative they were helping, and watching the interaction with other relatives varied from sweet to an absolute hoot.<br />I enjoyed this mystery from page one. The personality and humor of the characters, all of them, are outstanding. The relationship between the sisters is priceless.

The best start for a book is one that grabs your attention and keeps it there, and that's just what happens in this madcap mystery, Hatful of Homicide, when hat creator / sleuth Brenda receives a phone call on her birthday that leads her to an unusual, action packed get together. The reader is entertained, humored, and like Brenda Midnight, drawn into the middle of the pandemonium. As each scenario is played out in the kidnapping and murder, I'm not sure whodunit or why, but I am sure that this is a good story line with some good points. As the murder and mayhem moved on, the series characters lives continue without interfering or distracting me from the mystery. There were enough scenarios to make me think twice, and enough characters to keep me in doubt of my amateur work as a puzzle solver. I will be honest and say I had it solved about three-fourths of the way through, but like I said, there was enough going on to keep me in doubt until Brenda, taking a que from the infamous Murder She Wrote sleuth Jessica Fletcher, sets up the one she suspects.<br />Barbara Jaye Wilson's talent for adding humor and wit to her characters is exceptional. The off the wall humor is hysterical without being offensive or biting. I was impressed with the eclectic cast of Detectives Turner and McKinley, who recommend Brenda go back to Midnight Millinery and make hats instead of deducing; returning characters, Chuck the computer wiz and Elizabeth an older friend who shells out advice; Johnny the TV detective, who has some secrets of his own that make Brenda suspicious; P.G. Dover, Ambassador to Gintoflakokia who isn't who he seems; One Coat, a paint store owner, who loves to say I told you so to amateur painters like Brenda;  Brewster Winfield a sleazy lawyer with a strange sideline; Tommy who runs a local hangout and his bartender/cook Raphael, and last but not least Brenda's unique buddy, tall, gorgeous, sexy Dweena who occasionally under stress, can't keep Edward from peeking thorough.h.	2000-10-05

It's a romance about a young woman whose weight and appearance puts her in last position as a popular debutante, but in first place with a man desperately looking for a woman he couldn't possibly have an emotional attachment with, marry, and ultimately leave in order to get his rightful inheritance from his wicked, selfish grandfather.<br />In the first chapter, the reader is made aware of Henry Owens feelings, and what he feels are acceptable reasons for choosing Anne Foster and treating her the way he does. I'm sure each reader will have her own reaction to it and to the story line that reveals everyone's secrets, including Henry's parents and grandfather. My reaction was sympathy for Anne, but I had none for Henry or his grandfather, even up to the end. When Anne is rejected, her family and society put her out. She disappears, and after two years comes back for revenge. This is where the story takes off. Anne's friend Beatrice Leyden, Bea's brother, and mother, Helen, take part in The Plan to make Henry pay for ruining Anne's life. Henry's moral support will be found in his life long friend Alex Henley and a famous socialite.<br />The story as a whole was an interesting read. Jane Goodger juggles the different story lines quite well. Once I realized that the grandfather's journal was going to pop up, off and on, throughout the story I was able to capture each bit of the information, put it aside, and continue on with the main story. Once at the end I was able to put the grandfather's journal pieces together and understand the impact of it.  Like I said, I held no sympathy for his character, but I thought his storyline added a great mystery feel to the main plot.<br />I will give a couple of fair warnings: the sexual content is bold and passionate and the author successfully reveals the sad side of prejudice that is shown against those who are overweight. It's a serious, though provoking read that will have you turning the pages in hopes of a happy ending.ou turning the pages in hopes of a happy ending.	2000-10-05

Her protagonist lives in her hometown, writes mysteries, and is a member of a group that listens and critiques each other's work. She has found that she is a magnet for people in search of help, and that help usually result in a body or two.<br />In this storyline Leigh Ann, Jennifer's friend, talks her into going to their High School reunion. Jennifer's memory of the prom is more like a horror vision than a romantic recollection. Leigh Ann's selling point is a chance run-in with the high school hunk, Danny. Even though Jennifer is dating Sam, she is tempted to see the man she went to the prom with to get back at a cheerleader named Sheena. Those who still identify with their school memories and reunions will most likely relate to the excitement surrounding the reunion, and the characters reactions to feeling eighteen again.  I am one who doesn't relate to it at all, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the mystery.<br />The reunion totally encompasses what happened the night of the prom twelve years ago and the present reunion. There are plenty of characters; they all seem to rate in the popular to average clicks in High School, and they all seem to be successful in what ever they are doing in the present. Once the reunion takes off, things begin to happen. Jennifer finds herself face to face with Danny who warns her that old secrets are rising to the surface and he needs a private investigator, namely her; an old acquaintance shows up drunk spewing clues about the past mystery of a missing student; two sad, pathetic women fight over something only they find important; Leigh Ann goes home with a crooner; someone is murdered, and Jennifer goes home with the realization of a nightmare revisited.<br />As the mystery and suspense builds the bad guys aren't revealed or really even hinted at - the where a bouts of the missing student and the person or persons threatening Jennifer and her friends, pretty much stays hidden through out the storyline, which makes it a tough one to solve. The ending was satisfying for me, since I didn't have suspect in mind to begin with.

I have read and enjoyed both, but if I were to be honest, I would have to say this one reaches deep into the heart of the series' characters. Having read the first mystery where Sara the midwife and Malloy the detective are introduced, I am familiar with them and their families. I was already impressed and pleased with the new series, but in this mystery, I am doubly pleased by how well Ms. Thompson pulls the best and worst out of the main characters. This isn't an easy read, nor is it a cozy. The author delves deep in to the turn-of-the-century way of live, and it's not all pretty. There are some light moments, and the main character, Sara, does her best to lift others up during moments of hopelessness, but the better part of the story is pretty serious. The twist and turns used to keep readers guessing do just that, but what impressed me the most was the storyline as a whole.<br />When Sarah heads over to St. Mark's Place in New York, she is expecting to deliver another baby into Little Germany. She arrives to find a policeman and neighbors gathering at Agnes Otto's door, but not for the delivery of a baby. Instead it's bad news. Agnes' sixteen-year-old sister, recently brought over from Germany, was found beaten to death. Sarah tells Agnes that it may take a reward to get the police to work on the case. Unable to pay, Agnes gives up all hope of finding her sister's killer and overcoming the shame it has brought. It seems Gerda found some new friends at her job that introduced her to a dance hall and a way to get things that they as young women in life could not afford. Gerda becomes what is known as a Charity Girl. Sarah, being the kind person that she is, decides to take the case to Malloy in hopes of getting him to join her in investigating it together as they had the last case. Back for a return engagement with Sara and Malloy are Malloy's mother and his son, Sara's neighbor Mrs. Elsworth, and Sara's parents. The story line with Malloy and his handicap son is very touching; I hope the storyline grows as the series does.<br />The author gets into the mystery right away, and although the main characters lives are ongoing in the series, they don't interfere or take away from the mystery. So, if you like historical mysteries, especially series mysteries, this one is well worth looking into. It's a stirring mystery with characters that will touch you.Elsworth, and Sara's parents.

Kris Neri brings a wonderfully witty new series to the contemporary  mystery genre.  The debut delightfully introduces the series characters in  a humorous, hectic way.  The lead character and sleuth is Tracy Eaton, a  mystery writer with an optimistic outlook on life.  Her husband Drew is an  attorney and her parents are eccentric Hollywood stars that liven up the  storyline.<br />As the mystery begins, Tracy is discussing what has already  happened, but not in detail.  She then takes the reader back to the  beginning and later picks the story back up where the reader came in.  There is nothing confusing about this at all because it is done in an  amusing manner.<br />When Tracy and her husband Drew came to New York to  attend Drew's sister's wedding, what they expected was a vacation of sorts  and the usual wedding chaos.  What they get is family secrets, kidnapping,  panic and danger.  First, a family member Tracy never heard of shows up and  has the family acting odd.  Then, when Marisa is kidnapped before her  wedding and her fianc&eacute; is contacted about a very unusual ransom, Drew's  family gets even odder, if that's possible.  Tracy isn't just left out of  the family decisions because she is an in-law, her ability and intelligence  is also doubted.  Instead of getting bent, Tracy lets the excitement of a  real mystery case initiate her into finding Marisa.  Along the way, she  finds some engaging cohorts to help her sleuth and pull off  capers.<br />Revenge of the Gypsy Queen is told in the first person by the  lead character.  Usually, when a story is written in the first person, I  feel the story is being told to me.  Not this time.  Tracy's voice made me  feel included in this madcap menagerie.

Dem Bones' Revenge is the second mystery in the Tracy Eaton Mystery  Series. If you haven't read her first mystery Revenge of the Gypsy Queen, I  highly recommend it. Both books are memorable reads.<br />In starting Dem  Bones' I found Ms. Neri gets to the mystery pretty quick, and what I have  come to love about her mysteries is how she does it.  The interaction and  dialog of her characters are so entertaining that the story just flows by.  Some of the characters are more likeable than others, but they are all too  funny to be aggravating. At the beginning of some of the chapters are movie  scenes from Martha Collins movies. They poetically fit each chapter and Ms.  Neri shows her funny side here as well.<br />Tracy Eaton is a mystery writer.  She writes the Tessa Graham Mystery series. The Senior Editor of Perkins  &amp; Pimm Publishers wants Tracy to make some fast changes in her latest  manuscript or the series will be cancelled. Rewrites aren't the problem,  what is, is fitting it into the chaos that is taking place her life. Back  with Tracy is her husband Drew, who this time helps her to solve the  mystery -- of course he doesn't really have a choice since Tracy's mother,  Hollywood celebrity Martha Collins, was found with the body of Vince  Sperry, who is...was attached to Drew's trial case, and there's the family  member that followed them from New York and now needs more closet space,  which is why the carpenter is knocking holes in Tracy's closets and making  a mess of her home. Let's not forget Tracy's father, legendary Alec  Grainger, who can only be found when he wants to. If that isn't enough for  Tracy to deal with her mother-in-law keeps calling...and calling ...and  calling. An added character that works the murder is Detective Schuller, a  Miami Vice wannabe. He is a great addition to this already delightfully  clever ensemble.<br />Kris Neri entertains her new fans with another  outstanding, well-plotted mystery! The storyline led me to and fro. I felt  as busy as Tracy, and I was sitting down! Her humor is wonderful; I found  myself laughing out loud a lot! The storyline is always moving, never a  dull moment, and it's over before you know it. I came away a satisfied  reader; no disappointments, wishing, or wondering...well except when the next  Tracy Eaton mystery would be out.<br />Kris Neri's wit is never ending, nor is  her talent for good mysteries.I felt  as busy as Tracy, and I was sitting down!

This over-sized, informative book is more  than I hoped for.  I recommend it to all mystery fans, new and old. Each  time you glance through it, you can't help but come away with something you  didn't know before about the authors, their work, the mystery genre itself  and what keeps it growing. Bruce F. Murphy has left no stone unturned; he  has included everyone in the mystery field, not just the old classics or  most popular.<br />I really enjoy the non-fiction books that give us inside  revelation to the whodunit genre. The Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery is  just that kind. It's more than a listing of authors and titles. Once you  read the Preface explaining the triumph of the mystery story, you will  enter into a book that lists mystery information in a  dictionary/encyclopedia type style. You will find listings of authors,  pseudonyms, titles, characters, poisons, mystery expressions, conventions,  mystery awards, and more. It's great.<br />It's an informative guide of well  over 500 pages and worth every penny. If the cost is too much for your  pocket book, I recommend the book clubs that are offering it a little  cheaper.	2000-09-09

After leaving  Dean standing at alter and a church full of family members, Carly's car  breaks down in Chicago. It's late and the sound of a tavern attracts her.  She decides to go in and call a wrecker. Once there, her life takes on a  new turn. It's out with old, in with the new. All the rules she was once  ruled by, the same rules that almost had her making a drastic mistake, are  replaced by her own rules, and it's here that Carly learns what it's really  like to have control of her own life, and what it's like to really  experience love.<br />Cooper Wilde runs The Wilde Side, a tavern. When a  fairy princess dressed in a wedding dress walks into his bar, the sixth  sense he gained as a Navy Seal tells him she's trouble with a capital T.  One look into her unusual eyes and all those who meet her are captured by  her innocence. Marty Davis, Coop's father figure, warns Coop of what he  already knows, but it's too late for bikers Benny and Joe who have fallen  hard and become her personal bodyguards.<br />When Carly turns to Coop for  help, she in turn tries to help him with his failing business by coming up  with a wild idea. It's interesting to say the least. Carly also learns what  happened after she left the wedding when her sister Brenda shows up. When  Carly realizes there is a part of Coop she can't have, she's off again.<br />I  love the way Jamie Denton includes a familiar rule concerning how to be a  lady at the top of each chapter, because as the story plays out the reader  can see how Carly must make up her own rules in order to be happy. Will she  end up happy or running from another failed relationship? Breaking The  Rules is a bold, sizzling romance of a woman who, in a moment of sane  panic, bravely steps out to find what life really has in story for her.	2000-09-09

Mentions are made of the past two  mysteries, which help to explain where she is in her life at this moment.  Since I haven't read the first two Miracle mysteries, I'm not sure if they  are spoilers or not. Although Tori's proud to be the acting editor of a  local newspaper, her character also deals with change, worries, and  questions about herself. The atmosphere seemed a little down to me. Usually  if there are personality clashes or things are not going well, the  protagonist can fend it off with humor, but, to me, there wasn't enough to  accomplish this.<br />The mystery takes off when the civil war reenactment  takes place. During the reenactment a &quot;wonder wad&quot; is replaced  buy a real bullet and someone is killed. The police are calling it an  accident, but Tori doesn't agree, and since she made the newspaper a  sponsor for the reenactment, she decides to find out really happened. Also,  in the story line, Tori takes her two cats, Noel and Fred, with her when  she goes house sitting, and her love interest Garnet has to leave town for  a while.	2000-08-21

Sister Rose is the Elderess of the North Homage Shaker  Village. She has a keen interest in a group of New Ownites who have come to  observe them. Her first introduction is when a member of theirs is found  hanged. Sister Rose discovers a possible witness and takes her in. (I found  the scenes between Sister Rose and Mairin sweet and poignant.) Rose has  many questions about the other group, such as: What do they want? Will they  talk the Elder into change? Will they steal members away from their  declining village or just take over? Was the hanging suicide or force? Is  her group in danger? And most of all who does Mairin belong to and what  will happen to her?<br />A Simple Shaker Murder is truly a good mystery,  certainly fascinating with the 1930's depression era and Shaker theme. With  a flurry of Shaker details, Deborah Woodworth's latest whodunit takes us  down an ever-moving trail of twists and turns. Readers will find Sister  Rose a formidable Elderess and sleuth capable of solving the crime and  finding the answers to her own questions.	2000-08-21

If you are wondering about the reoccurring word  \\"Large\\" in the titles, there is a reason for it.  Josephine Fuller is a  plus size bombshell investigator of sorts, and all through the mystery the  subject of her weight is acknowledged, in both Josephine's spoken thoughts  and by others. I have read other plus size mysteries and this one is a  little more serious about the weight issue than those I have read. Anyway,  back to the mystery, Josephine is back in sunny San Diego and ready to go  to work. She is doing some investigating for Alicia Madrone, a rich woman  who gives out charitable grants, but before she does, she wants to know  everything about beneficiary. In this case the beneficiary is a group that  Mrs. Madrone's friend's daughter is helping. In fact the mother, Sally,  feels her married daughter is spending too much time at the hospital with  dying patients and not enough with her husband and daughter. Josephine is  introduced to this well to do, slightly snobbish family at a party, and a  memorable party it is.  Later two of the people Josephine has met, meet up  with murder and kidnapping. After a close call, Josephine decides to  further her field of investigation and find out why someone wants her to  give up this family and go home. During the mystery she has an out-of-town  visitor, has to deal with some personal issues, and worries about the  permanence of her job.<br />During the party scene, Josephine's defensiveness  and quick wit revealed. It's also where I met many characters at once and  found myself confused, and later even more characters are introduced, which  made me back track and reread the ones already mentioned. The mystery was  pretty good. I started putting two and two together quite a ways into the  story line, but Lynne's skill at creating doubt is very professional. The  characters were well written, but it was hard to remember everything about  each one of them so, like I said there was some backtracking. I do like  Josephine. She is independent, smart and sassy. She's very up front, calls  it as she sees it, and makes no apologies.  Large Target is a great mystery  with an impressive story line that takes a quick mind to keep up with it.rything about  each one of them so, like I said there was some backtracking.

His dad is  overpowering enough as a father, but what makes life even tougher is that  he is also Andrew's boss.  Andrew's father has sent him to a make an  assessment of the property an eccentric aunt left them five years ago. Once  there, Andrew meets a group of people as eccentric as his late aunt and  finds himself mixed up in the mysteries of their lives. The surprise for  Andrew and his family is that the lives and mysteries of these people help  to solve some serious problems in their lives.<br />Dorothy Gilman is an  exceptional writer with a lot of success behind her name, and if you ever  read the Mrs. Pollifax series or any of her stand-alone mysteries you will  understand why.  In reading Thale's Folly, I noticed it read more like  general fiction than a mystery.  Although hints toward the mystery are  dropped here and there, it doesn't take off until half way through the book  and even then the author focus more on the characters and their lives than  the mystery. Don't misunderstand me, I still liked the book, it was a  personal eye opener for me.  I loved the characters, they are convincing  and unusual, and the transition from city to country was so clear that I  felt myself relaxing along with Andrew Thale.<br />It's an enchanting,  compassionate story that, to me, took on the form of a parable with it's  ending.	2000-08-21

The new Shogun is out hawk hunting with his companions. The three men are  unaware that they are being stalked, and although their hunt remains  unscathed from the observation, their future isn't. The reader will be  aware of an assassination attempt. Who, what, and where is the mystery that  needs to be solved.<br />Ieyasu has been Shogun for less than a year and ruler  of the Edo area for thirteen years. His people have been in a mood of  celebration since he became Japan's ruler. In the midst of this  celebration, a murder occurs. Once this happens, the storyline skillfully  takes off and suspects are introduced in an impressive, shadowy style,  keeping the reader successfully in the dark until the end.<br />Kaze, the  wandering Samurai, has come to Edo to find his Lady's nine-year-old  daughter, who may have been taken to a local prostitution house. Once there  he does his best, in his eating and behavior, to hide that he is a Samurai,  so as not to give himself away.  While looking for the child, Kaze finds  himself in some unusual incidents that take his Samurai skills to escape.  He reunites with some old acquaintances, makes some new ones, and finds  himself in the middle of a murder plot -- as the one and only suspect.<br />The wandering Samurai mysteries are an inspiring addition to the  historical mystery genre. Readers will experience the seamless  collaboration of Japan's history with a compelling, action packed mystery.  Kill the Shogun is an easy read full of unforgettable characters. The theme  is far from cozy and I don't recommend it for younger audiences.  Mr.  Furutani mentions in the Author's Notes that, although this is the third  volume in a trilogy, it is meant to meld together as one narrative. Each  Samurai mystery can be read as a stand-alone mystery.	2000-08-21

While there, a man arrives  and forces past Nell to see Patsy who runs the Shelter. In an attempt to  stab Patsy, Mike is forced to shoot the intruder. This leads to problems  for Mike since the person he just shot isn't your ordinary wife abuser and  his wife isn't your ordinary abused spouse. Mike is traumatized from the  shooting, so Nell takes to sleuthing on her own. This leads her to suspect  the shelter director of some shady, extra-curricular business and Mike's  mother might be of covering it up.<br />I know spousal abuse has been used  many times in mysteries, but Ms. Sandstrom takes it a step further with  some informative information and I found this fascinating.  Readers can  expect a storyline with a reporter's insight, some interesting facts about  women's shelters, and a mystery that will take them in many directions to  one superb conclusion.	2000-08-21

She offers to  take on the case pro bono. Morgan is relieved, but suspicious. He should  be. Jill needs a single man for her plans, and why not pick one who is as  desperate as she. What does she need him for? -- A quick engagement of the  romantic kind.  Before these two agree to anything, their emotions are  already wreaking physical havoc with ricocheting hearts and electric  tingles. When a desperate Morgan agrees to the plan, off they go to her  hometown to meet her parents and attended her sister Carly's wedding, but  if you think this is all there is to the story... you're wrong. There is  plenty. Morgan has more to take care of than his business. Jill reveals why  she is so desperate to take a fianc&eacute; home, and then there's the family, the  wedding and Carly, who stars in Jamie Denton's next Temptation.

I found the characters strong and interesting; their  emotions and thoughts were clear. I loved how she described Morgan and  Jill's emotional feelings for each other when they first meet. Fair  warning; with strong emotional characters comes intense love scenes and in  this case they are very spicy.	2000-08-17

Now the only thing on  her mind is staying emotionally and physically well and make plans for her  baby, but a very tall, very handsome problem shows up at her jewelry  business to put a kink in that.  After years of separation, Regan refuse to  see Cole. When he forces his way in, Regan gives him her best shot... right  on his shoes.  You'd think this would teach the man not to bother a moody,  pregnant woman, but noooo, because he has an agenda.  The way she looks,  even the smell of her perfume reminds Cole of a time years ago when he once  loved her and came to hate her even more. Twelve years is a long time, long  enough for Cole Thornton to become a rich, unforgiving man. Coming back  into her life may not have been the right thing to do, but he can't back  out now, not after its all been confirmed, and he is here to lay claim to  what is rightfully, legally his.<br />When starting The Baby Bonus, I pretty  much knew there was more to the picture than a newly pregnant mother, a  scheming aunt, and a couple of kids who annulled a youthful marriage. The  subtle hints are dropped in just the right places to take the reader on a  ride of varied emotions, and reactions to expose the true story - like a  mini mystery.  The characters are wonderful; Regan is the outward runner,  always finding places to hide when it gets to be too much. Cole's reaction  is to find her and make her deal with it. He may be wise in what Regan's  needs are, but he's blind to his own answers. Cole is an inside runner,  fleeing from the true emotions that try to surface because of the rejection  he experienced twelve years ago. Regan's reaction to this is to try and  prove her emotions and hope he will find security he seeks.  Their  responses to each other and the part Aunt Liz plays in the storyline proves  those on the outside looking in do get a better picture, and maybe we  shouldn't take all advice with a grain of salt.<br />The Baby Bonus is a  passionate story about people, rejection, trust and coming to grips with  the past..

Sheila Malory is fifty...ish, a widow, the mother of a successful son, and  a popular writer of nineteenth century novels, but her real claim to fame  is her sleuthing skills. Fate has a habit of dropping mysteries into Mrs.  Malory's lap knowing she has as an exceptional gift for solving  them.<br />Lately Mrs. Malory has been behaving pretty laid back. She seems  comfortable with herself and her life in Somerset, England, so staying  home, sipping tea, and sharing an evening with her pets sounds much better  than going to a literary party of full of bookish know-it-alls. Her son  Michael effectively prompts her to go, and once there, Shelia runs into  some old Oxford school chums.

They reminisce, have a good time, and  promise to meet up again. Later they talk briefly, Beth shares some things  that are concerning her. Soon Sheila gets a call saying her dear friend has  passed away and the coroner has ruled it Death by Misadventure.

Since her father's  death, Taylor has always felt his presence with her as she enjoyed the fair  and reminisced about past fairs. This time it's different. Taylor has a  couple of unusual experiences that lead her to a Clairvoyant's tent for a  palm reading. The woman who predicts her future foretells of a trip that  will lead her to adventure and more.  The thought of an adventure excites  Taylor, but she takes the reading in stride and decides to take a vacation  to get away from San Diego for a while.<br />I'm not going to give away how  the time travel happens, but I will say I liked the wonderfully, eerie feel  it had as Taylor stepped onto the streets of San Diego in 1888. With clues  and his voice, her father guides her to the reason she has been brought  1888. The author has Taylor working for her keep in an unusual place while  she is there, and she meets some interesting characters like Wyatt Earp,  his young wife, and Jackson, their bartender. Taylor feels an emotional and  physical attraction to Jackson, and experiencing the same feelings, Jackson  finds himself confused.<br />Forever Rose is a passionate romance about a  young woman, whose love for her parents allows her, and them, to reach  beyond spiritual barriers to help others, as well as themselves. Warning:  The passionate scenes between Jackson and Taylor are a little past the  norm. At the back of the book, Ms. Wellington gives a brief history lesson  that is connected to her western time travel. I found it interesting and  enlightening and wished I had found it before I started reading the story.  I think I would have enjoyed it even more knowing that most of what she  wrote about actually existed at one time.	2000-08-02

Lindsey Davis is a highly intelligent writer, so when you pick up TWO FOR THE LIONS expect to be entertained to the fullest. I found the mystery remarkable and  matchless. The characters are distinctive, their personalities are well  formed, and their appearances are successfully painted by the author's pen.  I found the written atmosphere of Rome dramatic and complete. As usual, I  found Falco's good nature and wit amusing, and Helena to be an impressive  mate and saint.  Falco is assigned to investigate tax fraud (hmmm, the  world's first IRS man?). This leads him to a man who provides lions for  executions and entertainment. When an unusual death occurs, Falco becomes  sidetracked and finds assistance in his dearest, Helena, who helps him  resolve the mystery. Helena finds her brother in trouble and takes care of  Falco when he comes down sick (Does he take it like a man?). As usual,  people, situations, and the political subterfuge of Rome will be Falco's  obstacles in solving this one.<br />I found it to be a substantial read that  took a lot of concentration. Ms. Lindsey's knowledge of Rome and its  citizens is so comprehensive that at points I felt overwhelmed and needed a  break. To her fans, I'm sure, the greater size and more detailed the book,  the better. They soak up the atmosphere and dialect with no complaints, and  I have none either, but it may be a while before I'm ready to pick up  another. It's series I recommend for historical mystery lovers.	2000-07-19

The touchy subject seems to be computers and the Town of  Maggody going on-line. As the mayor puts it, Lottie wants to  \\" . . . give  our kids a chance to get their butts kicked into the new millennium.\\"  Some  residences feel they are ready to join the world on-line and some fear the  sins of Internet will overtake Maggody. The lab is approved because the  funding is coming from a grant, but once the surfing begins, ripples appear  in their fun when unwanted subjects make quick-see splashes into some of  the Maggody citizen's emails and ripples turn to waves after a young new  comer is murdered and the answer maybe setting in the new computer lab.  While Arly is trying to track down a killer Eileen and Dahlia try to teach  their men a lesson, Mrs. Joe Bob learns more about her own husband than  she'd like, and Brother Verber worries about his flocks lust-filled souls  and decides to posts his sermons on the Maggody home page.<br />As usual Ms.  Hess was able to blend the mystery plot with the quirkiness of Maggody and  make it believable. This author knows her characters and knows what works  for them. Although Arly is the main character in a way, I liked the fact  that she doesn't hog the limelight or become so witty and sharp to the  point of irritation as some lead characters tend to do. I did not feel  overwhelmed or distracted by the different characters in this whodunit and  had no problem following the mystery.  The Maggody series has one set of  impressive characters. When I am reading a Maggody Madcap no matter how  pitiful or ornery some of them behave I just can't seem to turn away or get  angry. They are colorful and amusing with an ambulance-chasing way about  them that holds the readers attention. In fact readers may want to find a  quiet spot to read murder@maggody.com so as not to disturb anyone with his  or her uncontrolled gasps, snickering and laughter.<br />If you haven't met  Arly, Ruby Bee, Estelle, Joe Bob, Mrs. Joe Bob, Brother Verber, Earl and  Eileen, Kevin and Dahlia, Daniel and Leona, etc., and the more recent  residences of Maggody, now is a good time. murder@maggody.com is one site .  . . excuse me, one millennium mystery you don't want to miss.n away or get  angry.

The short stories in this anthology have been discovered more than twenty years after Dame Christie's  passing.  I enjoyed each one of them, but I did find a couple darker than  usually, The House of Dreams being one. Manx Gold was too detailed for me;  I just couldn't stay with it.  Mystery of the Spanish Chest has Poirot  examining the motives of a killer. The Edge, another slightly dark one, has  a woman deciding whether to follow her heart or her conscience. In the last  story, The Harlequin Tea Set, a gentleman runs in to Mr. Harley Quin, who  helps him save a family from harm.<br />I carried this one around for a long  time. It kept me company when I found myself stuck somewhere with nothing  to do.  In essence, I feel I discovered something new in Ms. Christie's  work and was thrilled to have the opportunity. I recommend to her fans.	2000-07-19

But they never reach their destination.  After an explosion Fremont wakes to find herself bedridden in a possessive  Mormon's home and he has no plans of letting her go. Michael with the help  of a friend returns by train in search of Fremont but what he finds is  danger.<br />I found it to be an easy quick read and even heard a little woo  woo music from time to time as I read. It's light on mystery, heavy on  effects, with an ending I did not expect. A great read for Fremont fans.	2000-07-19

This is an enjoyable cozy with an unforgettable cast of characters who will ingratiate themselves in to your heart and onto your keeper shelf.  I realize there is nothing funny about murder but the way these two go about  solving it you can't help but chuckle from time to time.<br />Bert and Nan  Tatum, whose mother named after them after the Bobbsey twins, Nan and  Beatrice, are soon to be forty, identical twins and a one of a kind  sleuthing team. Their mysteries take place in Louisville Kentucky, home of  Six Flags Over Kentucky Kingdom and the Gigantic Flea Market.<br />In this the  third Nan and Bert mystery, the twins, against their better wishes, return  to sleuthing in order to find out who killed a unsavory flea market booth  owner. When this mystery hits too close to home Nan worries as she watches  her genteel twin sister change before her very eyes. Bert's maternal  instincts transform her from a kind, sensitive woman to a protective mother  with an agenda, the agenda being, to keep her daughter Ellie out of prison  and to catch the murderer who is making her family suffer.<br />The plot is  strong and current; in fact the contemporary atmosphere is so up to date  that even Monica Lewinsky gets a mention.  The mystery is hard to solve  and the authors exercise good timing when introducing the suspects.  As the  ladies sleuth, the reader is entertained by their identical yet individual  personalities.<br />Mystery readers, especially cozy fans, if you haven't read  a Nan and Bert Tatum Mystery you are in for a double treat.	2000-07-19

Cat's back, and her first sleuthing experience in DEATH OF A DJ is being recreated for a cop series called \\"Cop Watch\\".  Cat is being portrayed by \\"Her\\", Tommi Ann Butler, a famous actress that everyone is dying to see,  including one reporter who actually does.  Victor is also back, but  Hollywood can't seem to cast a spell on him like it has everyone else; even  Cat's mother gets in on the act with her cooking.<br />The cast of characters  is significant. When Cat asked Victor to test her memory as to who is who  on the set, she was more successful than I; I had trouble keeping the many  names and characters in my head.  The storyline has been done before, but  Cat's family and the author's humor puts a different sort of spin on it.  There is some great tongue in cheek humor aimed at police dramas, unions,  and rappers.  I did become impatience for the mystery, there seem to be a  lot of set up time and the mystery didn't begin until half way through the  book.  Jane Rubino has a way of giving the readers something they will  never forget; it reminds me of the chef who yell's BAM! It gets your  attention, and if you don't remember anything else about the mystery,  you'll remember that moment and should you read the story, you will know  when you get there.<br />This is the fourth Cat/Victor mystery, and I felt  there was enough mentioned in the storyline to give away the first  Cat/Victor mystery, so I recommend you enjoy this reporter/police series at  the beginning with DEATH OF A DJ, before you tackle PLOT TWIST.<br />It's a  series worth hunting down and a catching up with.	2000-07-19

It's a winner! Only the select few in this world are known by a single  name, and in the cozy mystery world, if she isn't already, Grace (Candi)  Covington will be affectionately known as \\"Mama.\\"  Nora DeLoach has created  an amusing, charming set of characters for her series; each one is as  lively as the next.<br />Mama's personality is the comfortable kind that makes  a stranger want to sit down and tell his/her story, but in this mystery the  wee ones at Mama's doorstep can't tell their stories, nor can the Labrador  retriever that dragged the baby skulls home.  So when an infant that was  nabbed once before is taken again after the mother is murdered, Mama and  Simone fear for the baby's life.  Because of her surgery Mama's comings and  goings are limited, but as Simone finds out in sleuthing, cooking, and her  private life, Mama's advice isn't.<br />Most definitely a good read! The plot  is well built, the characters memorable, and paths the author leads the  readers down are creative.  Mama is the Sherlock Holmes of the African  American South and Simone is her Watson!	2000-07-19

The author presented her characters is such a way that I found myself caught up in the turmoil with them; the mystery, especially in the beginning, the path it took, and how  she dealt with each suspect and lead impressed me. I found Sister Mary  Helen and Sister Eileen to be charming, intelligent and entertaining.<br />The  enjoyable, irreproachable Sisters are back and much to their and Inspector  Gallagher's displeasure, Sister Mary Helen and Sister Eileen find  themselves the focal point of a murder when Monsignor Higgins of St.  Agatha's dies after eating a piece of the Irish Soda Bread they had  presented him for St. Patrick's Day.<br />We all know the Church, through  individuals, is just as susceptible to the immoralities of life as any  other establishment, which is understandable since mankind is in charge,  but that doesn't make it acceptable, in fact it's judged more harshly.  Sister Carol Anne taps into this sort of situation successfully; she shows  us the thoughts and reactions of those betrayed and how willingly they hold  on to their own emotional burdens as fuel for their self-indulgent actions.  Besides being a great mystery, Death Takes Up A Collection is certainly a  remarkable interpretation of human emotions.	2000-07-19

They take time to explore their relationship while he is working  the crime. Michael McGarrity gives us a suspenseful mystery of murder with  all the crimes that lead to it.<br />There are enough characters and turns to  keep you guessing until the end.

Malice Domestic 9 gives tribute to the talented, matchless mystery author in their 14 original traditional mystery stories. Each story carries a British flavor  and sports the Christie flair.<br />Along with the other stories is a  Christie's original The Case of the Discontented Soldier. Major Wilbraham  finds England too tame. He has answered Parker Pyne's advertisement in  hopes of drumming up some excitement, and he does. I have to say Robert  Barnard's story is one of my absolute favorites. Nothing to Lose is about a  complaining elderly woman who moves into a nursing home and stirs up  trouble - loved the ending! Another I favored was Kate Charles story,  Murder at the Vicarage, about a vicar and too many spinsters. Ms. Charles  character is a mystery writer named Ms. St. James - a \\"monopoly\\" play on  words maybe? You don't want to miss Gween Moffatt's The Dark Tower, which  offers a brief mystery with her spinster sleuth Miss Pink. Honestly there  were a couple of the stories that couldn't keep my attention, but that's  ok, it only means they were meant for someone else. Did I feel that the  authors captured Christie's work? Yes, I do, and what's more, their  individual talents added to this pleasant read.<br />Don't miss out on this  one. It's a wonderful anthology written by Christie fans, for Christie  fans. This one goes on the keeper shelf with my other eight Malice Domestic  anthologies.	2000-07-19

She comes across as an honest,  witty, and courageous character.<br />After surviving surgery and treatment  for breast cancer, and a job lay-off, Hannah goes to stay with her  sister-in-law, Connie, at the family farm near Pearson's Corner, an old  fishing community on the Truxton River in Southern Maryland. While there  she discovers a body in a well. Being the person she is, Hannah feels since  she is the one who discovered the body, she has an obligation to the victim  to solve the murder. This is one obligation that leads her and Connie in to  some dangerous waters....<br />Marcia Talley is coming out of the chute strong  with her first mystery. I understand this is to be a series and I'm glad to  hear it. I'd like to see more about her husband, daughter and son-in-law.  IMHO, Hannah Ives is going to be one of our favorite protagonists and  Marcia Talley will be one of our most talked about writers.	2000-07-19

The stories in it reminded me of the great writers I enjoyed much earlier in the century. I liked the fact that they dated the stories to let the reader know when they were written. I must commend Tony Hillerman for his  impressive choices; it couldn't have been an easy job.  I can tell you  right now, don't expect to read it in one week, not even in a month. I do  recommend you savor and enjoy these stories slowly, even repeatedly, over  an extended length of time, possibly even between other mysteries.  What I  mean is, who would WANT to hurry through such classics as James M. Cain,  Raymond Chandler, William Faulkner, Susan Glaspell, Stephen Greenleaf,  Dashell Hammett, O Henry, Sue Grafton, or Flannery O'Connor? And that's  just a drop in the bucket of Who's Who in this 813-page book.<br />Flannery  O'Connor is one of my all time favorites. She has a strong way of making a  point; her endings have always taken me by surprise.  Her 1965-story The  Comforts of Home, about a son still living with his mother and the  unwelcome guest she brings home, has the honor of being included. Another  great one is, Susan Glaspell's 1917 story, A Jury of Her Peers; a story of  a husband who hung himself while still in bed. Then there's a 1905 story by  Willa Cather called Paul's Case; about a recently released safe cracker who  may or may not go straight. Be sure to read Tony Hillerman's introduction.  He tells the reader the difference between literature and mystery and how  mystery has evolved. On my keeper shelf it goes!	2000-07-19

When I mentioned the subject of this fishy cozy, a head went up and an added interest came looking over my shoulder. Living with someone who helps out  at the local lake has made me familiar with the Catch and Release project  for lakes, but I won't go into my opinion or anyone else's. I will say  using the subject in a mystery is inspiring, and there's nothing wrong with  having a little fun with it.<br />Fitzgerald is a political reporter who at  the moment is living a life I'm sure many men would like to live. After  winning the lottery, he took an extended leave from his job. He has rented  an A frame with the view of the Borchard River and fishes when he is not  writing. The only problem is that his collogues at the paper know where to  find him. Phillips calls to ask a favor of Fitzgerald. A fellow writer  hasn't checked in and Phillips wants Fitzgerald to check on her. When  Allison Thorne started out writing about catch and release ethics, she met  the Catch and Keep Alliance, a group that may or may not have connections  to the Michigan Militia. When Fitzgerald finds her the mystery and mayhem  begins.<br />Great premise. Great mystery. Interesting small town characters.  The ending was not what I was expecting at all.

Christine Spindler's introduction of British Inspector Terry is well done.<br />The Rhythm of Revenge is a smooth read. The conversation and atmosphere will fascinate you through the first seventy pages. Then the  mystery will hold you in place until it's solved and lives go on.<br />The  dancing troupe at The Caesar is putting on a show, &quot;The Taming of the  Shoe.&quot; In working together, their lives have become dangerously  intermingled. Jessica is obsessed with dancing; her husband and ex-lover  are obsessed with her. Alan is divorced and free to live the unusual life  style he prefers. Eileen, his ex-wife is crippled by a fire another member  could have prevented, and there's Susan who has yet to find out the secrets  everyone else knows. The investigators, Inspector Terry and Detective  Sergeant Blockley, are brought in when Roger, Jessica's husband, tells the  police she is missing. This is definitely one of those stories that remind  us, you can't trust anyone.<br />Christine Spindler's introduction of  Inspector Terry to the mystery genre seemed low-keyed to me, and that's a  good thing. She gives us just enough knowledge about DI Terry, his work,  and his private life without it overwhelming the mystery; in fact it blends  in quite well. Again, the atmosphere is great. The characters are splendid;  they are beyond a doubt as realistic as characters can get with their  passions, obsessions and faults.	2000-07-19

While the recent love of her life, Tom, is in California with their kids, Jackie and Jake are hired to work in a movie  being made by one of Jackie's former students. The movie is &quot;Under the  Dog Star&quot;; the idea and some of the scenes are taken from Jackie's  sleuthing experiences. The movie is being filmed in Jackie's small hometown  in Ohio. As we all know, no matter where someone yells &quot;lights,  camera, action!&quot;, a Hollywood ego is bound to find it's way to the  limelight, and in this case it's big time, so Jackie finds herself  wrangling a murderer instead of Jake and gathering more background  information on the celebrities than she cares to.<br />Those who have followed  Ms. Cleary's series will recognize some of the recurring cast members and  remember how enjoyable this series is. For new fans, although subjects from  her past books are mentioned I don't consider them spoilers. I liked the  way the way the mystery and the characters were presented. Ms. Cleary knows  how to lead her readers though the maze of twists and turns. Melissa Cleary  is well known for her popular series, Jackie is a seasoned sleuth, and Jake  makes for a great tailing partner, so you can't go wrong with In The Dog  House.	2000-07-19

Have you ever started a book and by the end of the first chapter just know that you are going to like it? That's what happened to me when I started reading MURDER OF A SMALL TOWN HONEY. This mystery contains everything I  like in a cozy, a likable protagonist, a unique mystery, plenty of twists  and false leads, and, most of all, a humorous outlook at life.<br />When Skye  left her small hometown full of small-minded people twelve years ago,  little did she imagine she would be back, eating humble pie and looking for  a job. She finds employment as a school psychologist with the Scumble River  School District. In her job, she realizes many have grown stagnant in their  jobs, and dislike being dissed in Valedictorian speeches. Oh well, this  doesn't stop our protagonist; she plows right in, shows her concern for the  students and does her job (These actions alone had me cheering!). Skye  tackles the mystery weaved throughout this terrific cozy debut with the  same unwavering courage, and it's a good thing she is a strong woman  because not only does Skye find the body of the murdered TV personality,  she sets her mind to solving the murder and risking her life to free the  person they've arrested and if that isn't enough she accepts a...blind  date. Is there no mercy?<br />MURDER OF A SMALL TOWN HONEY is super debut;  you can't get any better than this the first time out!	2000-07-19

I say this for two reasons: one being, it's a good mystery, and two, her superb handling of a sensitive subject matter.<br />In the mystery, Ellen and her  daughter Carrie go to the park. Suddenly Carrie disappears. Litchfield is a  small town in Texas and nothing like this has happened before. Maggie Ryan  and her partner are put on the case, volunteers help out, and the dogs are  brought in. Ellen, her husband, and her son, each have their own way of  dealing with the tragedy. In life I have found tragedy to be the key to  Pandora's box, exposing unspoken or unwanted truths that we would have  never faced, and in this case, it proves true for all those involved in  Carrie's disappearance. While reading, I felt emotional from time to time  because as we all know in this day and age that no one goes untouched when  it comes to child abuse or abductions, but Maggie Ryan's feelings -- her  words for the situation were so true and honest that they seem to speak for  me as well; I found this comforting.<br />If you are thinking of turning away  from this one because of the subject matter, DON'T. You have to experience  the gift this writer has in conveying human emotions, her talent in  building strong characters, and presenting us with a gripping, suspenseful  story. AND THEN SHE WAS GONE is the beginning of a mystery series I  recommend readers follow.	2000-07-19

Here is  where the time travel comes in, and being a hardy Time Travel reader, this  is what makes or breaks it for me. I was impressed and taken by surprise  with the way Ms. Hill chose to send her Viking into the future, and  although it was unique, I felt like something was missing, but I'm not sure  what. I just didn't understand it, even after the characters tried to  explain it at the end. Anyway Jorund ends up on the Texas coastline face to  face with some witty T-shirt saying Texans and just as luck would have it,  even in this crazy millennium they think \\"he's\\" strange. Jorund, now  nicknamed Joe, ends up with Dr. Margaret McBride at the Rainbow Clinic for  observation. I thought it was sweet how the author used the premise of  someone from another time to spot the simple remedies of those in the  storyline with emotional or mental problems. It has been said that over  education can make one socially and/or psychologically blind sometimes. As  for Jorund's relationship with Maggie, it's a sweet story of two souls  crying out through time. Their relationship gets hot and heavy, and  physically, maybe to the point of exaggerated, but hey that's what Sandra  Hill's fans expect.<br />At end of the book, author Sandra Hill reminds us  that mental illness is not a joking matter and that her book is strictly  for entertainment purposes.

Our memories are reverent, painful and even romantic. Sam McCarver was able to blend in just one possible story among thousands, which I am sure were occurring on ship.  He  puts his protagonist in the middle of the trouble and the reader gets a  birds eye view of the crew and the Titanic before and after she goes  down.<br />Professor John Darnell is hired to find out why passengers are  dying in cabin 13 on three different ships belonging to the White Star  Line.  It seems when those who meet the professor hear he is a paranormal  detective their first thought is abnormal happenings with ghost and demons.  Actually the Professor is a detective who is out to debunk the myth of  ghosts or demons being the killer.  And he believes the one behind the  cabin 13 deaths is very much alive.  I considered it an interesting  reading. The mystery of whodunit was over a little too quick for me. Mr.  McCarver is well versed in the history of the Titanic, as the reader will  discover should he/she decide to read it.	2000-07-19

Our sleuth is Jane Stuart. She is a sensitive widow and mother of one. She is also a literary agent, which adds some interesting elements to the story for those  who love to learn more about the book business. Winky is her cat. She helps  Jane to solve mysteries in the most unusual ways.<br />During a birthday party  Jane is throwing for her son, there is a gruesome discovery. When the  mystery begins, everyone reminds Jane that she is the new Miss Marple and  expects her to get involved. One of the perks for getting involved is  meeting a handsome returning detective. Jane juggles her job as parent,  friend, agent and sleuth with more grace than she realizes. She is a  strong, nonsense character surrounded by other well developed and yet to be  developed secondary characters.<br />I enjoyed this cozy so much I plan to  follow the series in the future. Besides some terrific series characters,  the mystery itself was fascinating. It blended in with Jane and other  characters lives without loosing ground. It took a turn or two that I  wasn't expecting and the ending was a remarkable surprise.	2000-07-19

Poirot is back in a play that has been rewritten into a mystery novel. As in past mysteries, Poirot finds plenty of support. This time it's in his valet George, who has a rare ability to press trousers just right, although  he has no imagination, Hastings who has returned to England on a visit, and  Inspector Japp who shows up later in the mystery.<br />Take a secret formula,  an eclectic group of people, one well-trafficked room, a Belgian  investigator, his best friend and aid, a Scotland Yard investigator, and  you have the makings for one of Agatha Christie's brilliant mysteries.  Premier physicist, Sir Claud Amory has decided to create a formula for his  company, but he is doing so at home without any protection. Sure enough,  the worst happens, and Poirot is the one he turns to. Poirot invites  Hastings to join him on the train trip to the country. By the time Poirot  and Hastings arrive, a murder has occurred, and no one has any sympathy for  the victim, making the circumstances worse for those involved. What starts  as a simple case of thievery, ends in murder, lies, and espionage.<br />Author  Charles Osborne, who helps with this story, includes a map of the room  where the crime takes place. The camaraderie of Poirot, Hastings and Japp  is charming. The mystery seems simple at first, then the usual Christie  twists and turns lead the reader down another more complicated path or two.  Poirot finds the mystery to be far more than a sordid crime - it is a  poignant, human drama. I found it to be an enjoyable, traditional British  mystery, and highly recommend it.	2000-07-19

Keating also writes the Inspector Ghote mystery series set in India.)<br />JACK, THE LADY KILLER is an unusual mystery because it's written in verse with illustrations.  The first mystery I read in verse was Martha  Grimes, SEND BYGRAVES, and I have been a fan of this unique style of story  telling ever since.  I am thrilled to say H.R.F. Keating's mystery in verse  was just as unique and fun to read as SEND BRGRAVES.<br />Mr. Keating gives  the author Vikram Seth credit for inspiring him after he read his verse  novel THE GOLDEN GATE.  He even quotes a verse of Vikram Seth's at the  beginning of this mystery and I think those in the publishing business will  get a kick out of it.<br />Mr. Keating's mystery takes place in 1935.  Jack  Steele, a new recruit to the Imperial Police Service in India is sent to  take care of a panicked elephant. While he's gone someone murders widow  Milly Marchbanks. With the District Superintendent in hospital Jack finds  himself working the crime. A witness, a boy named \\"Little Brown Gramophone\\"  tells Jack that just before Milly died she cried, \\" No, Jack, no!  So  searching for a member of the Briton Club named Jack should seem easy . . .  but it isn't.  The author takes the reader through the suspects, clues and  emotions of Jack in verse.<br />If you haven't experienced a verse novel or  mystery nows your chance. Don't miss it.	2000-07-19

Expect to find a strong-minded, independent  sleuth in a remarkable, fun series.<br />Seven Sisters is the name of a  quilting pattern, but it is also the name of a ranch known for breeding  quarter horses and making wine.

Benni has enough to  deal with in her own life, but the cowboy detective named Hudson, who is in  charge of the murder that occurs at the party, talks her and her quilting  group into helping him solve the murder and the mystery surrounding  it.<br />Earlene Fowler has a great sense of humor in this mystery. The story  line flowed well, and the characters were great, but I think I will only be  satisfied with the ending results if it flows into a future Benni Harper  mystery; Sure would be interesting if it did.	2000-07-19

You go through the entire movie in this  book. As you read, each scene sets itself up in your mind's eye. Although  some have been offended by this book. I think some have missed the meaning  or the moral that Stephen King was trying to get across. He was not trying  to show that if you are evil or make selfish decisions you could get away  with it. I believe Stephen King was trying to show how far mankind's moral  and self-sacrificing behavior has fallen through time.<br />This is a book  that will make you search your soul as to where and what you stand for.	2000-07-19

I am so disappointed to see the Inspector Morse series end, but I have to say Colin Dexter is a champ in the way he achieved it!<br />A year ago, a woman was murdered and left in an unpleasant state in her home. The Chief  Superintendent has a new lead in the case. He has assigned Morse and Lewis  to it. Morse, who is on vacation, won't bite. He refuses to work the case  for the CID, but it doesn't stop him from being one step ahead, as usual,  of Lewis. Of course Lewis, as usual, humbly works him self into the ground  following leads and being Morse's second pair of eyes and hands. During  this investigation, something is different about Lewis and something is  worrying Morse.<br />Mr. Dexter gives us plenty of intriguing characters that  are as thought provoking as he crossword puzzles. The list of suspects is  lengthy and perplexing, and the twists and turns are plentiful, but I have  to say the greatest one will broadside the readers and leave them  speechless at the close of the book. Mr. Dexter's skill at making his  characters so life like, as if they were acting out in ones mind, is  amazing. I took my time reading the mystery and found myself back tracking  so I wouldn't miss a thing! Once I finished, I was haunted for days with  the mystery and the outcome of the series. Mr. Dexter didn't just end a  popular series in an astonishing way, he also intermingled a complex  whodunit with an emotional twist that the characters and readers share. I  have never used this word with any book I have reviewed, but I will with  The Remorseful Day, it's stupendous.	2000-07-19

I was expecting a suspenseful romance, but what I heard was a  violent, intense-filled tale of cruelty, revenge and murder with two evil  prison escapees named Carl and Myron. I cringed each time the narrator, Mr.  Cole, read their parts. Carl is seeking revenge on a family and on his way  he leaves a trail of terror, sorrow and murder. A father, a (deaf)  daughter-in-law and her son know they may be in danger; their choice is to  face it head on, but not without some losses along the way.

Both Ezzy and the reader will find the old  murder following them throughout the present day story.<br />An Un-abridged  version of this story is available.

It's a gripping, gory murder mystery with a bit of sexy romance. Patricia Rasey is successful in drawing the reader into each grizzle, emotional or passionate  scenes. In fact certain moments in the story may seem too intense for some  and try as they may to look away, like a bad train wreck they won't be able  to. DEADLY OBSESSION is compelling and intense in the both the killers'  case and in the romance of Cole and Laura.<br />From the start the author has  the reader picking up on the tension in Cole Kincaid's life and how his job  lives within him. It's almost as if he senses the severity of his next case  before he even knows of it. Once he is called out and examines the scene  Cole finds his new case isn't a typical murder. A young girl has died a  bloody, sickening death because a psychotic killer has a perverted taste  for blood.

The problem is he'd rather she follow him for personal reasons and not for  a story. Laura's attraction to Cole is apparent, but she doesn't just fly  into any romance.

It's a harsh introduction and a touch of reality  into this anthology. Anne Perry steps out of the Victorian age for a moment  and writes one about an obsessive solider in W.W.I in her title Heroes.  Edna Buchanan in The Red Shoes, writes about a man who trades his alcohol  obsession for shoes, with a dangerous out come.

A stranded motorist walks up on a house for help, but finds a murder instead. And so Christie's play, The Unexpected Guest, now novelized by Charles Osborne, begins. The gentleman, Mark  Starkwedder, after knocking, walks into an unlocked terrace door in hopes  of calling for help, what he stumbles on is Richard Warwick dead in his  wheel chair, and the wife, Laura Warwick, standing in the dark with the  gun. I don't want to go any further because the rest is vital to the  mystery and how it gets so out of control. Included in the mystery are Mr.  Warwick's mother, a brother, a valet, a housekeeper, a nurse, a neighbor, a  Chief Inspector, and a detective. Each character is introduced and each  part is vital to the plot. The plot is classic British traditional with  9/10 of the scenes being played out in one room (map included), characters  coming and going, a moody Chief Inspector, a mellow detective, and a lot of  impressive curves, with the ending being the ultimate curve.<br />Charles  Osborne has done his best to novelize a rare treat, and in my humble  opinion, he did a grand job. The scenes and conversation, to me, were true  to the play, almost to the point that, while reading, I could envision the  characters on stage. Now I've heard the complaints-- \\"It's to slow.\\" \\"It's  to confined.\\" Well, it was a play, and that is the reasoning for the  limited movement and conversation. I think readers should appreciate that  Mr. Osborne has brought to life another wonderful Christie mystery. It's a  great Christie fix for those fans that have read or seen all her  mysteries.<br />Charles Osborne is an authority on theater and opera. He is  also a writer and has authored The Life and Crimes of Agatha Christie and  novelized Agatha Christie's other play, Black Coffee.	2000-07-19

Robert Skinner has penned another Wesley Farrell mystery for his readers. Hardboiled mysteries are not my cuppa, but historical mysteries are, and since I missed out on reviewing his last title Daddy's Gone A-Hunting, I  decided to grab this one up. Even though the storyline is a little stronger  than I anticipated, I'm glad I did.<br />At the beginning, Mr. Skinner gives  us a quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of Seven Gables, 1851: \\"God  will give him blood to drink\\" -- and so goes the story. Wes Farrell's world  is in the south; New Orleans to be exact. The former rumrunner now runs a  nightclub. His sweetheart Savanna Beaulieu, back from a sabbatical, owns  one in the French Quarter, but she only has a small part in this mystery.  The prologue takes us to September 23, 1934, when Louis Bras and his Hot  Six Combo were raising the roof at the Honey Pot.  Wes thinks he's minding  his own business until a Coast Guard Lt. Commander George Schofield shows  up looking for an anonymous informant. The night leads to a deadly  conclusion, one that will come back to haunt Wes five years later.  1939: A  T-agent (Treasury agent) by the same name of Schofield shows up asking  questions about George Schofield in an attempt to get some answers to that  night in `34. The T-agent doesn't know Wes was with his brother that night,  so Wes is in the clear, except that he wants answers of his own. At the  same time, an undercover cop is killed and Chief of Detectives Frank Casey,  Detective Sam Andres and Negro Squad Detectives Merlin Gautier and Sergeant  Israel Daggett take to the streets looking for the killer or killers.<br />In  Blood to Drink, the reader will know who the killers are. The mystery to  solve is: whom is the bone chilling, threatening voice that gives the  orders.  Wes Farrell mysteries are highly seasoned, suspenseful reads to  begin with, but with bad guys like Mercer and Zottie it becomes an even  more demanding read. The author, Robert Skinner, is talented in his ability  to bring the south, during the thirties, to life.  With a stroke of his  pen, he creates an intoxicating atmosphere of inestimable, dynamic  characters so rich in dialect and life that they ascend from his inscribed  print.  It isn't just a mystery; it's one of the most provocative paintings  of the south I have read in a while.talented in his ability  to bring the south, during the thirties, to life.

The first question is, who was the one bullet that hit them  both, meant for, Zachariah or the other victim? The second question is,  rifle, rifle whose got the rifle?

After two other's have been  shot and his twin sister starts sleeping with her gun, against her husbands  wishes, Zachariah is desperate to solve this one!<br />I could not guess  whodunit until the author was ready to tell me.

Just like the cops in the story who are dying to hang a lawyer, I was pulled in to the story line immediately.  As a reader, right away questions popped  into my mind like, what is he up to? Who is he protecting? Why is he  willing to sacrifice himself? Or did he really do it? The detectives are  just as curious; one feels it's a \\"duck\\" (easy case), and that the lawyer  \\"loves himself\\" (is guilty), while the other \\"doesn't like him\\" (thinks  their being played). Also on the case is a DA who lives for courtroom drama  and loves putting people away, and the defendant's inexperience lawyer, who  everyone underestimates, including herself.<br />With so many suspense /  thrillers being written, it really tests an author's talent to produce a  genuine edge gripping, page-turning story line again and again. Ms.  Scottoline seems to have that talent. Although the plot was a bit simple  for me to solve, the path to getting there was entertaining. In listening  to the audiotape, my daughter and I would became so involved to the point  we had to either rewind it or turn it off and discuss it. There are scenes  and remarks that made us cringe... like the autopsy; but for the most part  the twist and turns had us holding our breath is suspense.<br />As to the  audio listening itself, I think a male voice would have been better.

Haskell Blevins, a private detective and part  time drug store assistant for his brother, is dying for a case to come  along and save him from the menial task of stocking deodorant. When the  town Pentecostal preacher shows up asking for his help, Haskell, still  smarting from his last humiliating experience with the preacher, thinks  twice and charges double before he agrees to help. Once on the case,  Haskell has to solve who is blessing the church bank account and playing  Indian giver.<br />I really enjoyed this mystery. The series characters are  wonderful. I appreciated the author's humor and ability to make light of  the things we take too serious. The mystery is well planned, and, to me,  the plot was simple, but don't let that fool you; just when you think you  know - the author throws some great curves.<br />A great series to follow.	2000-07-19

Tooley gives her readers the second installment of The Sam Casey Mysteries and what an installment it is. Having never read a Sam Casey Mystery, I expected the typical police procedural; murders occur, police  work it out. Not!  Ms. Tooley adds an extra touch of paranormal to this  police procedural. The story picks up from the first Sam Casey Mystery,  When The Dead Speak, which I recommend you read first, because both books  are worthy of attention, and it will explain a lot of what's going on in  Sam's life.<br />Detective Sergeant Sam (Samantha) is back. A lot happened to  her in the first mystery, and as Sam comes home to get her bearings and  face the department, she finds her mom, a Sioux medicine woman, heading  home to help her people. (Reader's are updated on Sam's mother and  stepfather throughout the story). Before mom heads home, she takes it upon  herself to move Sam in the master bedroom and includes some of Jake  Mitchell's things as well. Sam isn't so sure about Jake just yet,  especially since his promotion by the untrustworthy, new police chief who  doesn't like her, but her mom feels he is the one and plans to help it  along. After a dinner, Sam goes with another detective to a crime scene on  a floating casino. First she finds her self excluded from the information  and case as detective, only to find her self dropped into the middle of it  in another way. Her gift gives her the ability to see what is happening in  the case without the police information about the violent killer. Sam  doesn't just see the ending result of the murders, she sees how it is done  and feels the suffering of the victim. It's intense, it's traumatic, and  not for the faint of heart.  The ending will blow you away!<br />Ms. Tooley  has a superlative, supernatural mystery full of intense, persuasive  characters in a grizzly, matchless story line. A promising series to get  started on before you are left behind.	2000-07-19

Truly Donovan's debut mystery CHANDLER'S DAUGHTER is the beginning of a wonderful cozy mystery series.<br />As I read, I found myself taken with Ms. Donovan's single, plus-size, middle-aged, amateur sleuth Lexy Connor. She  is witty, intelligent and delightful!<br />Lexy lives in Gunbarrel, Colorado,  where she runs her own software consulting company.  She loves to eat out  with friends and owns a lovable, well-mannered Westie named Molly.  Those  of us who can't live without our mysteries, Internet or email, will find a  comrade in Lexy as she is blessed with the same passions.<br />In her debut  mystery, Lexy finds her quiet Colorado world shaken when her friend Tally  calls for help.  Tally offers to pay Lexy her usual software consultation  fee, if she will solve the mystery of a dead stranger Tally was supposed to  meet.  This mystery has Lexy traveling the country (a trip you don't want  to miss) in an attempt to find the murderer who is also hunting for her  friend.	2000-07-19

Take a rural hometown, some quirky down home characters, a wise cracking Police Department and the usual family stress of the Easter holiday, blend them with murder and mayhem and you have a unique, humorous mystery called  Death and the Easter Bunny by Linda Berry.<br />Trudy Roundtree has had enough  happen in her life... her husband was killed in a hunting accident. Later  she returns to her hometown after a failed romance. When Trudy doesn't know  where to go or what to do, her cousin Hen, short for Henry, hires her as a  police officer. After investigating the latest fire and death in Ogeechee  Trudy learns it's really murder. Since the other officers are out of  commission with a rash they picked up while hiding in the woods on stake  out, Trudy takes the lead in investigating using the help of the Ogeechee  kudzu vine (Georgian for Grapevine), the volunteer fire marshal, and some  of Ogeechee's other interesting citizens. While she's sleuthing she also  deals with an alien visit, a family that loves to be mirandarized and  cousin-in-law holding a grudge.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this mystery. It's  witty, humorous and up front. Trudy doesn't just investigate a crime, she  introduces us and gives us insight on her hometown, her family and her  friends. Trudy is a woman with a quick wit and can take what ever comes in  stride and go on. When you read it, you too will feel her confidence and  shake your head in agreement at her hometown wisdom.	2000-07-19

Valle Escondido, New Mexico, a small town where everyone knows everyone. Charlie and her assistant Sally decided to take a visit there and meet one of Sally's friends. Once Charlie meets Laura and learns of her friend's  death due to a miscarriage, it only takes a grain of doubt from Laura for  Charlie to realize she can't help herself. Was it a miscarriage or murder?  With her brother talking gun control and a hunky visitor from Hawaii  finding a landing spot in her heart. Charlie does a little soul searching  while she hunts down the murderer.<br />Charlie is a PI who does it her way  and when she doesn't have a human partner, she brings along her dog Rusty  (my favorite part of the read). I enjoyed the mystery, which wasn't easy to  solve and that's how I like it. And Ms. Shelton knows how to add the right  amount of humor in just the right spot.<br />Her mystery series is a treat to  read!	2000-07-19

MISSING MARLENE introduces Jane Stuart, Nick, and Winky in their debut mystery.  Jane is Nick's mother. She is also a literary agent. Winky is their feline cohort. Marlene is the nanny that Nick and Jane felt they  could live without but hadn't expected it to happen so suddenly and  suspiciously. Jane hired Marlene because she was the daughter of a friend,  and when the nanny comes up missing, it's Jane who risks it all trying to  find her.<br />What an impressive debut and cast of characters created by Evan  Marshall.  Through the mystery, we will meet those around Jane and her  small family. Their stories are remarkably interwoven through the mystery  without distracting from it. The plot is great, although one part of the  storyline (the colorful part) has been touched on many times in other  stories, the way Mr. Marshall uses it is just as attention-grabbing.  Through the mystery and mayhem, Jane leads her readers to and fro to meet  some interesting and unsavory characters and puts herself in some  interesting situations.

There is nothing I like more than seeing a new historical mystery on the market, but the icing on the cake is when it's the beginning of a series with a promising future. After reading Rosemary Steven's debut Death on a  Silver Tray, the first in her Beau Brummell cozy mystery series, I am quite  sure that a promising future is just what this series has. It's a light,  engaging read with an admirable mystery plot.<br />We are first introduced to  Beau Brummell when he is stopped for fashion advice. The subject of fashion  with our fastidious sleuth continues off and on through the mystery in an  entertaining way. I didn't mind this because it's a part of our sleuth's  character and what makes him so remarkable.  Freddie, the Duchess of York,  comes to Beau Brummell for help when a friend of hers, Miss Ashton, is  accused of poisoning Lady Wrayburn. Although the maid is to blame for the  moment, the mean spirited Dowager Duchess's tongue has offended many, which  gives us plenty of suspects and interesting twists in the story line.<br />Ms.  Stevens did a great job of blending a regency fashion dandy into a mystery.  The historical atmosphere was pleasing, and being a debut, the introduction  of Ms. Steven's colorful cast of characters was enjoyable and learning  about each one of them was not overwhelming in the least. Expect to be  entertained with mystery, fashion, and wit as Beau Brummell attempts to  solve a mystery and take on an unusual new resident.	2000-07-13

Expect to get your money's worth when you read the third Inupiat Eskimo Mystery by Christopher Lane. It's three hundred and forty two pages full of mystery, espionage,  picturesque scenery, native traditions, and great characters.<br />Ray  Attla, an Inupiat police officer, is a terrific lead character. After  finding a body Ray would rather go on with his vacation, but, Glen, the  local Sheriff and Chaplin, finds there is more to the case than a fall from  a lift, so he talks Ray into helping him out. As a professional, Ray stands  back and lets Glen take the lead in investigating the death. Once he is  drawn further into it after checking with his Police Department, Ray  decides he wants some answers as well. Ray is a cautious and understanding  husband when it comes to his pregnant wife, Margaret, who has to work  during the vacation, and, as a dad, he is patient and generous with his  time, although a bit slow to recognize that his four year old daughter,  Keera, is sensitive to their native traditions, which supernaturally gives  her more knowledge about the recent death and case. Readers will find the  secondary characters involved in the mystery plot are just as strong as the  main characters and help to strengthen the story line.<br />In picking up A  Shroud of Midnight Sun, I didn't know what to expect. What I got was a  pleasant surprise in the discovery of a great mystery series. Christopher  Lane's writing genuinely impressed me.	2000-07-13

The paranormal novel, Other Worlds, is a step away from what Barbara Michaels (Aka Elizabeth Peters) normally writes, which is romantic suspense, and maybe that's why it isn't up to her normal talented standards. Since I listened to the abridged audio, some of the Michaels  drama may have been missing. I can't say for sure, but this may be why I  came to this conclusion. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, but it  just didn't have the Michaels suspense that her other titles are blessed  with. Another attribute of Ms. Michaels that is missing is the romance, but  I don't think it would have been appropriate anyway.<br />There is a meeting  at an exclusive men's club. At this cozy get together is Frank Podmore of  the Society for Psychical Research, magician Harry Houdini, Arthur Conan  Doyle, Nandor Fodor, former director of the International Institute for  Psychical Research. In this meeting, two stories are presented. One is a  story of a witch ghost that haunts the Bell family of Tennessee for several  years... As a supernatural ghost  tale, the book held it's own, with the exception that the characters were  not taking it seriously, and this seemed to keep me from taking it  seriously. The analysis and criticism after each story didn't bothered me,  but some of the individuals' opinions did. Maybe it's just me, but some of  the attitude's came across more as sexist than actually debunking.  But,  all in all, because it is a Barbara Michaels work I would still recommend  it to those who know her work and those who don't, after all it was an  interesting concept.<br />When listening to an audio, I like to make  mention on how it appealed to me. When I see Barbara Rosenblat's name as  the narrator, I pretty much expect a good read, and this one was, but I  wonder if the story would have been a little more engaging with a male  narrator. Don't let my wonderings stop you from trying the audio or the  book. It was an interesting paranormal read.	2000-07-13

The walk leads him to Capricorn Place, a couple  of memorable experiences and a change in his newly retired life. Later in  the mystery, he meets up with Superintendent Alleyn at a reception where an  assassination has occurred. The superintendent has his hands full trying to  keep his old school buddy, now president of Ng'ombwana in Africa, safe from  his many enemies. Knowing Mr. Whipplestone's past job description, the  Superintendent requests his aid  - Mr. Whipplestone obliges.<br />I enjoyed  reading Ngaio Marsh's mystery. It has the flavor of an old fashion British  mystery, with an added flare of espionage. The author's ability to plant  suspicion and lead her readers into the twists and turns are well done.  Although I know Black As He's Painted is a Superintendent Alleyn mystery, I  feel Mr. Whipplestone and the adorable recently procured addition to his  household steals the show and adds charm to the mystery. If you haven't  read a Ngaio Marsh Mystery here's your chance to experience a writer said  to be in the same league as Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers.	2000-07-13

They inherited their late great uncle Horatio's home with some stipulations, no cash for so many years.  Although named the Grace and Favor Cottage, it is really a mansion, and  Lily tired of trying to make ends meet, has an idea how to use the cottage  to earn a living. She wants to turn it in to a Bed and Breakfast of sorts,  invite a famous person, and surround him or her with fans. The first  blessed or cursed soul, depending on which side you are looking at, is the  famous fiction war writer, Julian West. With him comes his helper, a young  man that has been with him and his cousin for years. Also on the list of  paying guests are Addie Jonson, a teacher; professor, and critic Cecil  Hoornart; siblings and old Brewster acquaintances, Raymond and Rachel  Cameron; Mad Henry, invited by Robert, and one self-invited guest who gets  permanently uninvited. Support characters back again are, the estate  lawyer, Mr. Prinny, the cook Mrs. Prinny, the maid Mimi, the police chief  Howard Walker, and news editor Jack Summer. Life goes on for these  recurring characters and the reader has the pleasure of joining in.<br />It's  a fun mystery, full of wonderful characters. The storyline repeats some of  the Brewster duos past, and there are some small spoilers, so if you  haven't read the first Grace and Favor Mystery, Anything Goes, you may want  to. It took me a little longer to solve this mystery than the last. The  plot was pretty basic, but what makes the read so fascinating is the  atmosphere, with the jargon and historical facts sprinkled through out, it  really brought the thirties era to life. It's a series I plan to continue  following.	2000-07-12

When Reese Howard, a freelance writer, shows up to do a story on  her case he has a desire of another kind in mind for the long legged lovely  Sabrina. Reese needs a story and Sabrina needs the finances the magazine is  willing to pay for her artificial insemination. They collaborate to help  each other out. From the moment of their first meeting at the Bayside Caf&eacute;,  emotions emanate. Excitement is just below the surface for these two, and  it doesn't take long for it to happen. I have to admit the physical  relationship is sudden, but as I read along and learned more of Sabrina's  emotional neediness, I understood it. Later, Sabrina has a surprise for  Reese, but he doesn't know if he's ready for it. Reese is a former  investigative reporter and has his own past to deal with. This gained my  sympathy as to his actions and reactions. It made him more realistic. When  they come to an agreement about their future, both are happy, more so then  they expected, but there is one part of Reese that no one in the past has  reached, and Sabrina doesn't know if she can settle for only half a  relationship.<br />We live a hi-tech world, which makes it too easy for  individuals to avoid emotional or personal involvement of any kind.  Katherine Garbera hits on this sensitive subject with a bang. In creating a  story, she reminds us why we need to lean towards each other instead of  away, and that as humans, no matter the emotional or psychological baggage,  we need the one on one connection that unconditional love gives us.  Watching Reese and Sabrina reveal their pasts, pull them into the present,  and deal with the confusion and confrontation, made for a wonderful read.  It's a love story full of desire, transition, and success.	2000-07-12

Some believe the past is bound to repeat itself through others, in time.  The most unique theory I have ever  heard is that we are living on a parallel earth where the past and present  are in tandem, and if you stay still long enough and look to the side at  just the right moment, you might capture a glimpse of it.<br />In the  prologue, Willa Hix starts us off with a beautiful quote from Dante  Alighieri about waking up lost in the middle of one's life. The story  begins in New York, in December of 1899. Virginia Thornton is trying to  hock some jewelry to hold the creditors at bay and help cover her holiday  fortnight of guests at Malmaison until New Years. A tradition her parents  started when they built the house where Ginny grew up and holds a lifetime  of memories. Since her parents died, Ginny has been lovingly living up to  the traditions of Malmaison, but her selfish husband Thomas is about to  turn her secure little world into a nightmare. During the celebration,  Ginny learns that Thomas has destroyed their livelihood and lost their  home, and if that isn't enough, he takes the easy way out, leaving her to  face a penniless, homeless future alone.<br />Have your emotions ever become  so overwhelmed that you were unable to speak?

The man to meet Ginny in the  future, in her conservatory, is Sam Sutter - a distant relative of the man  Thomas lost the house to. Once they meet, Ginny accepts the curator job,  and stays on with a goal to figure out how to go back in time and reclaim  her home. In this time, she and Sam build a friendly relationship, and she  really wants to tell him the truth, but can she trust him not to think her  crazy and toss her out of her beloved Malmaison?

Ms. Dunbar unique  talent really stands out in her writing.  In each mystery the first  chapter/page sets up the story line, yet does not really give anything  away, other than Claire's feelings sometimes. I like the way she sets the  reader up for each chapter.  And the ideas she has come up with for doing  away with her victims, I think I can safely say most if not all of them are  original ideas yet to be thought up by others.<br />It's a funny, entertaining  series.	2000-07-11

I think someone compared them to Nick and Nora Charles in the \\"Thin Man,\\" but, I believe if Nick and Nora were to read the Eclarie  series Nora would have a case of vapors and Nick would give us one of his  comedic eye rolling, staggering takes.<br />First time readers will find in  the first pages that this is not a typical mystery. Claire and Dan are the  ultra perfect southern couple, perfect looks, perfect jobs, perfect sex  life, it seems everything around them is perfect, perfect, perfect . . .  except those dang, pesky murders that seem to crop up at the most  inconvenient times.<br />When Mrs. Shelby Bell, or Hells Bells as Claire calls  her, invites Dan and Claire to the Bell Sands on the shores of the  Mississippi, they decide to turn it into a second honeymoon. As we find  out, this is one honeymoon they won't forget, since it involves the redneck  mafia; a beauty pageant; a contestant who takes her interviewing cues  straight out of \\"Basic Instincts\\"; a former pageant member bent on revenge  and a hurricane named Babe.  Dan and Claire already think they are in over  their heads, could it get any worse? Of course it can and it does.<br />I  found the mystery aspects in REDNECK RIVIERA interesting. At first when I  read the words \\"Redneck Mafia\\" I had to laugh, I just didn't know what to  expect, maybe a mystery of who killed Bubba with the loaded can of Miller  Light, or who stole the concrete brick holding up the abandoned Ford that  crushed Melvin while he was napping. I still don't know if they are a real  gang, but the author pulls it off, there are enough twists and turns to  appease the mystery reader and for those who like the added sexual  characteristics to their mysteries, Ms. Dunbar has added plenty of that as  well.	2000-07-11

I also enjoyed following his relationship with his wife,  especially in the last chapter....	2000-07-11

It's an interesting gardening series that takes place in Culver City, CA.<br />It seems Joe Portugal and I have some things in  common, the love of cactus and succulents and learning to live with the  condition of CRS (for the meaning, you will have to read the book).<br />Competitiveness can be found in just about every avenue in life, and  most certainly in gardening, especially when it comes to wanting the best.  This is just one of the possibilities Joe Portugal has to consider as he  tries to help an old acting friend who has been accused of murdering the  host of the Orchid Spring social.  While he is sleuthing, Joe takes the  time to try out for a commercial and to comfort Gina when life with her  lover, Jill, gets shaky. Gina, being a good friend and old sweetheart of  Joe's, puts on her sleuthing shoes and joins him on the path of murder and  mayhem among some beautiful flora and disconcerting inhabitants.<br />I  think Mr. Walpow's sense of humor, along with his characters stood out the  most.  The plot, the suspects, and the paths taken were very well set,  although I have to admit, I did have it solved about half way through.	2000-07-11

His aunt, Lady Binstead, has set an engagement trap for him, and now he is on the run. Cord has always liked his neighbor, Corisande, but he isn't in love with her, so he heads for parts unknown --  to his relatives anyway. His aunt hires the Bow Street Runner to find him.<br />Ginny Tate lives with her aunt and uncle in Rose Cottage, on the Earls  property. She is trying her best to help her aunt keep Uncle Henry's work  under wraps. Her chance at married life was lost with her fianc&eacute;e in the  Battle of Waterloo, and now she is considered a spinster. Here are two  people that believe love is for fools for different reasons, and are quite  sure they will never fall into the marital entrapment, but alas fate and a  rider-less horse are about to change things.<br />Buried Secrets isn't a  romance with a hero and heroine playing a simpletons game of should we or  shouldn't we.  Embedded in this wonderful romance is a lesson in giving  one's self and reaping the rewards. Anne Barbour's regencies are far from  quixotic. Her stories are very practicable and reachable. Her readers find  themselves surrounded by the storylines with a need to participate in the  actions and emotions of the characters. If you don't believe me, read  Buried Secrets and see if you don't wipe your brow with relief and cheer  the Earl of Corday on as he escapes a near engagement, his aunt's  frustration in thinking she is doing the right by the thankless Corday  brothers, feel Ginny and Aunt Louisa's fear and worry at others learning  their secret, or feel Uncle Henry's obsessive passion to solve the secret.  It's a wonderful story that gets to the heart of the matter; people,  emotions and voices are always in motion.<br />(I wish Signet would use larger  print in their regency romances.)	2000-07-11

Cozy readers should be warned that it's a bit on the strong side with language and loves scenes, but the mystery is so impressive that I found myself reading it straight through. I  love the cliffhangers and shockers that Tom Eslick leaves at the end of  some of the chapters; they are great attention grabbers.<br />Chad Duquette,  a volunteer rescuer and our protagonist, along with his step-brother Damon,  a volunteer fire fighter, are called out to what they assume is a hunting  accident when Mr. Chambers calls for help after his friend Rodriguez has  been shot. Once they reach the shooting victim, a handgun is found instead  of a hunting rifle, and suddenly all hell breaks loose with someone ending  up as the next victim. Chad Duquette has a sad and haunting past that he  deals with throughout the mystery. With a little help from his therapist,  Chad finds himself analyzing the recent shooting case as well as his past.<br />Expect some surprises and impressive twists as you read &quot;Snow  Kill.&quot;	2000-07-11

I found it riveting, suspenseful and hard to put down.<br />Kate stands in the living room with her daughter Anna. The site of a  cable van triggers memories for them both. This is where Kate begins to  tell her story. The transfer from the present to the past is effortless and  when the story shifts back and forth between Kate and her recent love  interest Michael the transition is just as smooth. It's cold and rainy, and  Kate sees a woman stranded on the roadside. When she stops to play the Good  Samaritan, Kate finds herself in desperate need of help. Also in this one,  Michael her solid, faithful love interest has to deal with the added stress  of a problem at work that unfortunately finds it's way to their home.<br />The mystery and characters weren't the only ones on the move. I had to  carry this one with me everywhere to get it finished. I couldn't put it  down until I knew the outcome, which was just as satisfying as the mystery  itself.	2000-07-11

This time his friend Hugh Curtis has just been unwillingly relieved of his musical snuffboxes, and his wife has died under what Thomas considers suspicious circumstances. Without a doubt, they know who the culprit is  because every time a collector in their group finds a rare treasure with a  mechanical bird, Vincent LoProire climbs out of his expensive hole and  effectively claims it. After years of being bullied, threatened, and now  murdered for their precious musical treasures, Thomas heads a caper that  rivals &quot;The Sting&quot; to extract revenge.<br />I enjoyed reading Larry  Karp's first mystery The Music Box Murders, which introduces us to Dr.  Thomas Purdue, but after reading SCAMMING THE BIRDMAN I have to say it's my  favorite of the two. Scamming the Birdman is extraordinary!  It's a rousing  escapade with some eccentric, hilarious characters. Our lead  sleuth/scammer, Thomas, teaches us a lesson: just when you think you know  someone, they prove you wrong. The ending will take you by surprise, and  some readers may feel judgmental about it, not me, I enjoyed an incredible  caper with a surprising twist.	2000-07-11

When Dan and Claire's friends Charlotte and Foley decided to marry on Christmas Eve everyone shows up the event, including the  ex-wife.  Poor Daltons meet up with rich Daltons, artists, who are also  guests, put on a show all their own. The brides mother is wants a  true-to-form baptist minister for the wedding, but Dan provides one with a  little extra spirit in him.  I had to laugh at Ms. Dunbar's  characterization of Claire's maid, it is hysterical. Oh, did I mention the  panty raid lead by Dan?<br />I found this one to have a strong plot with  plenty of suspects and twists and turns - I think it's because of all the  strange wedding guests.  This has been the most impressive mystery I have  read in the Eclaire Mystery Series.  Readers can expect this one to be just  as titillating, humorous and colorful as Ms. Dunbar's past mysteries.	2000-07-11

The solving of the mystery seemed easy for me, although  the different paths confused me at times and I found myself back  tracking.<br />In this mystery three unusual thieves steal a not so famous  painting that leads them in to a lot of trouble. And there is a rumor that  a lost diary linked to Christopher Columbus may be hiding something more  valuable than the worth of the diary it's self, if it exist. Annabel finds  herself writing an article for the magazine Civilization and does the  research at the LC. She also finds some stiff competition in both, her  amateur sleuthing and in her marriage to Mac, with a gorgeous, aggressive  TV Reporter name Lucianne Huston.<br />One thing I will mention to the reader  is, he or she will find there are many paths to this mystery and to get the  complete picture they need to follow them all closely. MURDER AT THE  LIBRARY OF CONGRESS is a strong, intellectual mystery with interesting  facts.	2000-07-11

I hope I can do this humorous, distinctive mystery justice because I really had fun reading it.  What we have here is a possible paranormal mystery that meets up with a historically preserved Clan from  Wales.<br />Rhiannon Beltene writes vampire novels. She even has a web page  for her books.  She is also the Beltene of the Clan Beltene -- a family  that resides in a castle in Michigan.  I think I can safely say they exist  with old fashion ways that extend centuries back from Wales and past  generations. Things begin to change for the Beltene Clan when bloodless  bodies start showing up with two marks on the neck and the sleaze press  arrives at the sheriffs' office because they are being notified before the  murders happen.  Wait, there's more. Since the sheriff has just  retired, Rhiannon and the Clan have to officially &quot;Welcome&quot; the  new sheriff sooner then their family tradition normally would. It's the  only way they can let him in on their family secrets, which might help to  solve the case.  And when I say &quot;welcome&quot; I don't mean your  typically, knock on the door, cake in hand, welcome to Brennan County,  Michigan kind of &quot;welcome.&quot;<br />Ms Brewer has written short stories  of the Clan Beltene.  This is her first mystery novel including them.  I  think it's going to be one of the most talked about mysteries in the  traditional and historical circles.	2000-07-11

But once there, academics take a back seat when she witnesses a  teacher being harassed by a foul-minded, foul-mouthed anonymous person set  on revenge.  There are two well-known teachers at Miss Merritt's, one is  considered the cornerstone of her department, the other is said to be the  pillar of hers.  One of them will be found with her head pounded to a pulp.  Sarah finds she isn't the only amateur sleuth in this one, and it seems  everyone has his or her own scenario of who did it.<br />Ms. Borthwick has  done a masterful job in creating her characters, especially Madam  Carpentier also known as Madame the Knife.  I think every high school has a  lively group of seniors who resemble Hannah, Rosemary and Zoe. There are  many characters involved, but with a glance at the Cast of Characters page  offered at the front of the book, I had no problem remembering who was who.  The plot is excellent, and half way through the mystery I found myself  just as caught up in working out the scenarios as the characters. I don't  know that I found it necessary for everyone to use strong expletives so  often in the story; sometimes it seemed like over acting, but the mystery  and how it was presented, the characters, the humor and the setting were  all A+ as far as I'm concerned.	2000-07-11

She has a secure job with a publication and thought her amateur sleuthing  days were behind her, not so, when she finds herself having lunch at the  Mad Platter with a convincing executive from UpShot Records named Phil.  Phil needs an amateur detective to do a background check on a future  singer, and their mutual friend Henry recommended Kate.  The only reason  Kate accepts the case is because it seems easy and she needs the money to  send her fourteen-year-old daughter Kelly to summer camp. But as the case  moves on Kate finds it is anything but easy. While checking on the  background of the singer Troy, his girlfriend Shay disappears. Again Kate  finds herself in the line of fire and takes up the hunt for Shay even when  the record label backs out and tells her to quit. If there's one thing  Music City has in common with Hollywood it's that not everyone is who he or  she claims to be and that is some thing Kate is about to find out.<br />I  found Cryin' Time to be a cozy, interesting read. Country music is only one  of the many types of music played in our home, so in reading Cryin' Time I  recognized the famous names and songs mentioned. Ms. Tishy gives the reader  a good mystery; her detailed description of Nashville's famous and not so  famous sites help to bring the mystery to life. The only problem I had was  when the author penned her protagonists' road directions one too many  times, I don't feel they had anything to do with the plot and they seemed a  bit distracting. Maybe the author should consider including a simple map in  the next mystery. Also in Cryin' Time, Ms. Tishy gives us a look at the  different sides of business in country music. Do you really know what a  flyswatter is? Can you guess what a rack-jobber has to do with Wal-mart? Do  you know why a country band is caged? I do, now.	2000-07-11

And to create this &quot;fantasy dinner to  remember&quot; Angie decides to do a little research. She seeks the help of  her friend Connie and an old love interest from the past that works for  NASA.  He takes her and Connie into the world of alien believers who are  more impressionable than one could imagine.  They meet two groups, the  NAUTS and the Prometheus. Each group accuses the other of being phony.<br />Angie's love interest Paavo Smith and his partner Yoshiwara spend time  together investigating the strange murders and talking personal about the  women in their lives.  Pavvo noticed Angie has not been honest with him  since her old flame arrived.  And Yoshiwara's wife, third generation  Japanese, is taking Japanese lessons and spending a lot of time with her  artistic teacher.<br />I found Angie Amilfi to be a warm, independent  protagonist. And I was able to picture each character just as Ms. Pence  penned them; from the graphic corpses to the alien believers named for the  t-shirts they wore. The recipes in the back are out of this world, but I am  afraid the mystery might cause some controversy among believers and aliens  alike.  Ms. Pence did so well in presenting this millennium mystery that  she may find herself being followed by the men in black....	2000-07-11

THE MAN WITH MY CAT follows THE MAN WITH MY NAME as second in Paul Engleman's Phil Mooney series.<br />Phil Mooney use to be a paramedic field officer with the Chicago Fire Department, but now it looks like he has  taken up amateur sleuthing to fill his time. In this mystery, Phil has  inherited his father's Maine coon feline named of Phull.  I have to say, if  I had a cat with as many nasty habits as Phil claims this one does, I would  give it to my nearest enemy as a payback. Although Phil has been tempted to  do far worse to Phull, he has talked himself out of it each time; the cat,  like the car he now drives, belonged his late father. For putting up with  the cat, his quick-witted wife Frankie says he should change his name from  Phil to Phool.  When Phil takes Phull to a vet, the cat is catnapped.  With his bad habits, I would of said good riddance, and Phil is tempted to  do the same, except that he loathes the person he suspects. Catnapping soon  turns to politics, murder and mayhem.<br />Paul Engleman's presentation of  the seedy side of law and politics is very well done! He doesn't write too  strong or too colorful in this subject as our most popular suspense authors  do these days. He does get right to the heart of it and leaves no stone  unturned.  In Phil and Frankie's struggle to fight back I found myself,  like many will, identifying with them and cheering them on.  The characters  in THE MAN WITH MY CAT are well defined and remarkable. The plot seemed to  be well thought and took many imaginative directions.	2000-07-11

She hosts a PBS cooking show and  attempts to sell a rare pair of skies. When the buyer of the skies is found  dead, the circumstances do not look good for Goldy, but with the PBS taping  at Killdeer Ski Resort, Goldy is able to do a little skiing and a lot of  snooping to solve who really wanted her ex-boyfriend, the art critic, dead  and why. Goldy's other problem seems to be that everyone is getting wise to  her other skill as an amateur sleuth so getting answers to her clues are a  bit more difficult this time around.<br />The plot is as cleverly laid out,  as are the mouth-watering recipes. The twist and turns are as subtle as  Goldy's secret ingredients - just when you've got it - you don't.

Also, Detective Hawkins, Sam's on again-off again interest  shows up and finds her in the middle of another murder.<br />With all the  hype about Sam's past time (a dominatrix) and the author's last book,  &quot;Black Rubber Dress,&quot; I picked up this book with my eyes half  shut. I expected a risqu&eacute; story line with a character that overwhelms the  mystery - not at all. Although Sam dresses and talks the part, the story  line itself was not at all risqu&eacute; or tacky. I will be honest and say I wish  there had been more focus on the mystery, and sometimes the conversations  seemed to go on and on. Like I said, Sam is an interesting character with a  wild side, and the secondary characters are just as attention grabbing.  It's an interesting, out of the ordinary, mystery series everyone should  give a try. I think you will be surprised too.	2000-07-11

Gillian is lecturing at Stanton College  near by and living with her mother Estelle and a cat named Rumpole.  A  student from her class is found dead and the result is murder. When an old  acquaintance is arrested as a suspect Gillian doubts his guilt and goes in  search of the truth.  Her mother who has a weak heart can't help but put in  her two cents and later Gillian receives a visitor who also can't help but  get involved.<br />I enjoyed Old Wounds it was well done. Suspects are pointed  out one by one as the twists and turns take us through this academic  whodunit. I think readers will identify with Gillian as she remembers her  past, deals with forgotten emotions and makes plans for the future.  I  found her relationship with her mother interesting.  In Chapter 12, there  is a scene where they discuss something they do have in common, solving the  mystery, and Gillian has come home boasting of a clue and Estelle becomes  indignant and reminds her that she is playing the part of Watson, not  Holmes. To me, that moment was very poignant as to how we try to hold on to  the parent role no matter the age of our children.  Poisoned Pen Press  will publish Gillian Adams first three mysteries.  In the Shadow of King's  was put out in August; Bad Chemistry will be out in 2000; My Sister's  Keeper will also be out in 2000.<br />It's a very good read.	2000-07-11

Mad's new business name is Madeline Bean Events, and back with her is assistant Holly and partner Wes. With money in  their pockets, businesses are hounding them in hopes of being bought out by  Mad and her entourage. One such business proposal comes from Vivian Duncan,  Beverly Hill's premier wedding consultant. Once Madeline and Vivian meet on  Rodeo Drive, Madeline finds herself reluctantly involved in Vivian's  affairs, which leads her to murder, mayhem, and the handsome, reocurring  Police Lt. Hunnett.  As these continuing, never dull characters headed  off to a wedding being held in a natural history museum, I was puzzled as  to why a couple would marry in such a place. There is nothing romantic  about it, especially the lighted elephant scene. A few pages later it is  explained that the bride's grandfather is a famous TV personality of an old  wildlife series and after all we are talking about an aberrant town full of  eccentric people. Author Jerrilyn Farmer effectively shows us this is just  the type of eccentricity that livens up her mysteries. The story line is  well done and surprising -- not at all what I was expecting when I started  reading. As the author leads her readers through a maze of suspects and  clues, they can look forward to being fully entertained and amused by Mad  Bean's mystery events.	2000-07-11

CANINE CHRISTMAS is a Christmas mystery anthology and each mystery includes one or more canines.<br />I have always said a presenter or editor could not go wrong with an anthology.  But when the anthology takes on a  special subject such as this one I feel it makes even more entertaining.  CANINE CHRISTMAS has a wonderful variety of authors such as, Parnell Hall,  whose story \\"Clicker Training\\" leads the way; Virginia Lanier who treats us  with another story involving her bloodhounds; H. Robert Perry writes a  `tongue in cheek' (at least that's how I took it) mystery called the \\"Toy  Pincher,\\" which I found it quite humorous; Mark Graham's serious story  \\"Fencing Crib\\" brought some emotions out of me; Jeffrey Marks offers us a  hard-to-solve whodunit in \\"Yellow Snow; Deborah Adams writes a very funny  story about a Psycho Santa and his elves and there's more!  After reading  each one I am quite sure anyone who reads CANINE CHRISTMAS will find a  favorite among the many tails... I mean tales.<br />Note: Holiday mysteries are  a treat to read, especially during the Christmas season, but mind you if  you stick to enjoying them only one month out of the year, you will miss  out on the many, many holiday reads that have been offered in the past and  will be offered in the future.

This is the third in the Marti Hirsch Mystery series.  It follows Last Dance and Stayin' Alive.  In this series the protagonist, who refers to herself as a drug  using, hard-core feminist, free-loving bisexual, Jewish-atheist, does her  amateur sleuthing in the middle of New York's disco hot spots.  Although  she is a writer, Marti is the last of her breed that refuses to, as she  puts it, sell out to the system as others have in order to be successful or  rich and famous. In this mystery unwanted changes are coming and Marti will  prove she is tough enough to survive.<br />At the beginning of I Will Survive  Marti's friend and now famous artist, Jana, employs her. Whenever Jana  needs something she tells Marti to \\"take care of it,\\" and Marti does, even  when she finds Jana dead in the basement.  As the words echo in her head,  Marti hits the frozen pavement of New York risking herself and her marriage  to solve Jana's murder.  She finds herself dealing with an angry cop from  the past who would love to frame her, one too many close calls and what  some would label moral decisions as she sleuths. As usual, Marti does it  her way and victims are plentiful when it comes to her sharp wit and  kickboxing attitude as she successfully hunts down the killer.<br />Like most  authors, Ms. Moore pens her characters in a colorful, lively way hoping to  get a reaction from the reader, and she did. Sometimes I cringed, sometimes  I laughed and sometimes I wanted to reach in the book and slap Marti upside  the head, especially on occasion when she jumped off the sleuthing track  and spitefully boomeranged the chip on her shoulder at others. One example  would be the scene with a relative who offers her support by being her  lawyer.  While reading I found Marti's personality and off-brand humor  overwhelmed the mystery and although funny at times, it became distracting.  I have to be honest and say Marti Hirsch isn't one of my favorite  protagonists, but I think she will be one of the most memorable.  In this  mystery, the reader will find the usual line of suspects along with the  usual twists and turns, plus a few titillating sex scenes.my favorite  protagonists, but I think she will be one of the most memorable.

Touted as a prequel, readers are taken back to where and when Faith first started catering and  sleuthing.  The place is New York City. The time is the late 1980s.<br />Is  there such a thing as a cultured mystery? If there is, then THE BODY IN THE  BIG APPLE is it. I found it very easy to fall into this polished whodunit.  Ms. Page's words flowed effortlessly making it easy to follow the  characters and the storyline.  I found Faith to be a pleasant, adaptable,  protagonist whose personal life is intermingled pleasingly into the mystery  without it taking over. The plot was very good. The practiced mystery buff  in me almost had it figured out, but had doubts and was sufficiently  surprised at the end.<br />A young, unmarried Faith Sibley has embarked on  independence and a catering business. While catering a lavish party, she  runs into a close friend named Emma who she hasn't seen in a long time.  Emma is in serious trouble, but doesn't want to go to the police for fear  of harming her husband's political career. When Faith agrees to help her,  Emma's past begins to rise and trouble starts brewing for them both.<br />The  added bonuses to this appetizing mystery are the tantalizing menu ideas  sprinkled throughout the book and the scrumptious recipes, which all  include apples, offered at the end of a satisfied read. WARNING: I  recommended that you approach THE BODY IN THE BIG APPLE the same way as  it's recommended one should approach grocery shopping - on a full stomach,  if not you may find yourself carrying this mystery back and forth to the  kitchen in an attempt to find something resembling the fabulous food  mentioned in this enticing whodunit.	2000-07-11

The authors in BE MY VALENTINE present the readers with history, romance, passion and the blessings of love. I enjoyed the talents of all three authors even though I did feel the intimacy of the characters were too sudden and detailed for such inexperienced, young ladies in the times the authors are writing in, but hey that's romance!<br />Cupid's Arrow by Constance Hall (Cornwall, England - 1802) I found the opening in Cupid's Arrow cute, a great entrance into a sweet short story. Fitz and Brooke have an interest in each other, but commitments and consequences with those in their families is most likely to keep them apart...until two little cupids step in, that is.<br />Meg's Secret Admirer by Cheryl Holt (London, England - Popular Society) This has a heroine who will pull at your heartstrings and a hero who will most likely at some point aggravate you, and then win you over. In this one Meg creates her own secret admirer, but faces some unusual circumstances when she is found out. The gift giving and parties create a Valentine atmosphere.<br />One Special Night by Jackie Stephens (Blue Plains, TX - 1849) I appreciate it when an author successfully creates that early Texas atmosphere, and Ms. Stephens is very good at it. Her characters were touching, and her town was realistic. Two kinds souls ache to reach out, but their past and present circumstances and others around them continue to stand in the way. Let's hope the Valentine dance is the answer to Doc and Cara's need to find an eternal love.	2000-07-10

I was pleased to find it brimming with mystery and suspense along with a budding, passionate romance between the main characters.  The touch of time travel was  intriguing and certainly added the element of \\"what if.\\"<br />The romance is  between Jake, who suddenly appears out of nowhere injured and confused, and  Molly, a young widow without a past.  Their relationship starts out slow,  just as a romance should, but when they finally connect, love, passion and  words begin to heat up. The mystery is -- Jake, how he arrived twenty years  in the past, who wants him dead and why. The suspense is who ever was  chasing Jake twenty years before, may be the same ones who have Jake and  Molly on the run now.<br />\\"Time Lapse\\" held my attention from the beginning  to the end. The characters and secondary characters are strong and  credible. The twists and turns definitely held me in suspense along with  the main characters.	2000-07-10

I am not a fantasy reader, but I do like unusual stories, and after reading John Marco's first book in the Tyrants and Kings series, Jackal of Nar, I  just knew this one was going to be just as good. I was right.  Honestly,  most fantasies tend to leave me confused, but not this series. It's not  only easy to follow and comprehend; it's hard to put down! Just as with  Jackal of Nar, it is full of never-ending action, villainy, politics and  fabulous technology!<br />The story begins with General Vorto, the Supreme  Commander of the Legions of Nar bombarding the walls of Goth with the War  Machines of Nar (Descriptions of these are fascinating).  Duke Lokken of  Goth flies the Black Flag of Nar and misses the Black Renaissance. Having  shredded Harrith's Banner and sent it to Nar City, he now finds Vorto  Bombarding his walls.  The Empire now suffers a war of religion between  religious fanatics Bishop Harrith (Light of God) and Count Biagio (The  Black Renaissance). Richius Vantran, the Jackal of Nar, is now considered a  traitor. He is in exile with his wife and daughter. When he becomes  involved in the religious fanatic war, his old enemy the Count, who wants  total control over all, makes plans to take Richius and Dyana's only child.<br />The Grand Design has a futuristic atmosphere, yet also carries an  historical feel. The characters are great. Besides the remarkable main  characters, Harrith, Biagio, and Vantran, there are the even more  impressive secondary characters like Lorla, The Mind Bender, Simon, Duke  Enli, Duke Eneas (The Raven Master) and many others. Each character is  intriguing, well written and impressive. It's an impressive fantasy series;  expect to be entertained throughout.	2000-07-10

Although the largest percentage of America holds Washington up as a hero and historical character to remember, a man who had known him all his life  and was consider one of his critiques in his day didn't. After Washington's  death, Hesperus Draper's only goal was to prove Washington was a man and  not the demigod that the American people thought him to be. After paying a  servant to spy, Hesperus learns that Mrs. Washington has burned some  letters immediately after her husbands' death. This feeds his desire to  expose Washington, so he sends his nephew, Charles on an assignment to talk  to everyone who ever knew Washington in his lifetime. This leads  Christopher on a fascinating, memorable trip to meet many people we now  consider famous in history. Through these interviews, he follows  Washington's life, from the time he is born, to his first job and being a  new landowner, to his marriage, his military services, and his political  life, all the way to his death. Christopher's outcome of the interviews and  his relationship with his uncle add to the story.<br />Barry  Bostwick's reading impressed me! When one listens to an audio the reader  does make a difference. He was able to keep the characters separate by  speaking differently for each one.  An expert reading, Mr. Bostwick!<br />I was amazed that so much could happen to one man in a lifetime. The  political and military details are fascinating. Historians and fiction  readers will love this. I thought the ending was unique.	2000-07-10

Although reading COMPASS doesn't really reveal anything that would ruin it for the reader if she chooses to read it first,  I would still recommend finding WINONA'S WEB and reading it before  COMPASS.<br />The story is a contemporary romance and takes place on the  Indian Reservations in Northwest Michigan.  Winona Pathfinder is an elderly  medicine woman who knows she is dying.  She calls in her younger cousin  Hawk, who she has been teaching and tells him to gather the family.  The  family is her daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren.  As the family  tries to communicate in this sad and awkward time, the author lets us hear  what each one is really thinking although tradition and manners has them  saying something different. We learn Winona's daughter is as much a woman  of the present as her mother is of the past. And one of her grandchildren  will someday carry on the tradition. Hawk is surprised when she tells him  to give her social pipe to a white woman named Meggie.  Meggie is a  psychologist who attempted to treat Winona and convince her she wasn't  dying, instead Winona taught Meggie about the earth and spiritual world.  Hawk is even more surprised when Winona asks him to watch over Meggie.  Hawk has dedicated his life to his people and he feels to love a white  woman would be a betrayal, yet here is the wise woman he left the South  Dakota Reservation for, telling him to watch over the one white woman he  already fights temptation with, Meggie O'Connor.<br />The reader will be  drawn into the enchanting world of Indian life; its myths, its beliefs. And  they will see how our American Indians must balance their past with their  present.  The glimpse into their version of the afterworld is captivating.  I think we all can learn from the different traditions and methods of other  cultures. Priscilla Cogan shows a side of the Indian culture that is both  mesmerizing and fascinating. Also, take notice of the Glossary of Lakota  words at the back of the book.<br />Look for the first award-winning book in  this trilogy, WINONA'S WEB, to become a movie in the year 2000.h  mesmerizing and fascinating.

Philip Caputo served in the marines; worked as a foreign correspondent; was held hostage in Beirut; shared a Pulitzer Prized in 1972; was wounded in Beirut while  working for the Chicago Tribune; wrote two memoirs \\" A Rumor of War\\" and  \\"Means of Escape\\"; wrote four novels and 3 novellas (Exiles). THE VOYAGE is  not a manly book aimed at men or even young men.  It is meant for everyone!  I can't begin to say how moved I was at this tale.<br />It's June at the  turn of the century, just off the shores of Maine a father, Cryrus  Braithwaite, is rowing out to his small ship. His sons Nathaniel, 16, Drew,  13, and Eliot, 15 are curious as to why their father is coming to the ship  with only the clothes on his back while they are prepared for sailing.  Nathaniel being the oldest has noted that since their stepbrother Lockwood  arrived their father has been in a black mood. If you are wondering where  their mother is, she is in Boston fairing well from an illness their father  is keeping secret. When they are all settled the father tells them to head  out to sea alone and not return until September. When his sons complain  Cyrus almost weakens but instead gives a bitter laugh, says, \\"It's a new  century\\" and rows away leaving them stunned and frightened.<br />This is  how thirty-eight-year-old Sybil hears the tale of her late father's family  history. To her this is like a page torn out of a missing diary, with a gap  in the middle -- the impression that the beginning had an earlier beginning  and the ending left the listener suspended, expecting more. Sybil visits a  relative who repeats the history for her, and as he does we the readers  relive what the boys experienced on their three-month voyage, which ends in  Cuba. It's not pleasant - it's heartbreaking.  Once through the history of  \\"the voyage\\" Sybil's relative tells her that her family is a generation of  parents who destroy their young, but he swore that he nor anyone else in  their family knew the true reason, the true secret as to why Cryrus sent  his sons on that deadly voyage. Not able to accept this, Sybil and a friend  have a trial of sorts.  And the witnesses are those who lived in the past.

He is a ghost hunter; she is a psychic  archeologist who uses her gift to release paranormal traps -- an equivalent  to present day bombs. They agree to marry for the business, but Virginia is  having second thoughts.<br />BRIDAL JITTERS was an interesting short  story.  I am constantly amazed at writers and their visions of the future.  Ms. Krentz has some interesting ones and at some points I had to reread to  make sure of what she was trying to get across.

I have read many ghostly romances,  but this one had a way of haunting me without the constant presences of  ghosts. As I read along, I tried to take in everything just as I would a  mystery. I didn't want to miss one clue about Lord Barrett or Rachel or  what was going on in Caroline's family home... well, I'm getting ahead of  myself so let me explain.<br />Lady Caroline needs to marry before a certain  time or she loses her family home and wealth to her brother and his cold,  greedy wife. Since it's during the 1700's in England, there is always a  Dandy to spare looking for a chance to marry for money, but as the reader  will find out, there is a reason Caroline can't get a man to stay at her  family home long enough to marry. She becomes desperate and reaches into  the lowest place available to save her inheritance.<br />The Prologue begins  the tale, and reading through will introduce you to some rich, substantial  characters, but you won't know the truth until the last page.	2000-07-10

The first thing I noticed about Mollie Katzen's book was the brightness of it. The vivid yellow cover of this larger than life book covers a multitude of dishes that are categorized with color bands on the edges of the pages.  The multitalented Mollie Katzen also does the wonderful artwork included in  the book.  After reading it, I believe Vegetable Heaven's appearance would  attract the most impressive cooks attention, and the contents would earn  their utmost respect.<br />Ms. Katzen covers recipes from appetizers to  soups to main dishes to condiments and more. She even includes her popular  26-minute menu from the Mollie Katzen cooking show, Vegetable Heaven.  The  recipes go a step further than most, and there is enough variety to please  everyone in the family. Personally speaking, I am impressed with her  meatless main dish ideas that have the ability to fill up the heartiest  meat eater (my husband) and make him happy. As for myself, I am always  eating the side dishes in an attempt to satisfy the vegetable / fruit eater  in me, but it was never enough.

The Irish Devil is the first title of this series. This one takes place in the Middle Ages. It's full of Celtic charm and passion. To me, it started out  dark, but the closer the characters got to emotional freedom, the lighter  and stronger the story became. I will give you fair warning that the  passion is teasing and bold.<br />The story starts out with a servant telling  the tale of the Irish Devil. He's a cold-hearted man who fights to the  death on the battlefield. On this night, the tale is more frightening  because The Irish Devil himself is about to appear at their doorstep to  claim a bride from the callous family they work for. He will choose between  the natural daughters of the Lord and Lady or the stepdaughter who has been  disowned because of tragedy long ago. Once a choice has been made, the ride  to a new life begins. Here in lies the heart of the story as these two  learn to love and trust each other.<br /> This is definitely a grand romance  series to look out for.

The tiara, with its 25 perfect rubies, has been an  object of conflict between the Holland and Fitzgerald families for over a  hundred years.

Spenser Heatherington is from &quot;The Sherbrooke Bride&quot; and Helen Mayberry is from the hit novel &quot;Mad  Jack.&quot;<br />Spenser becomes aware of Helen at the Sherbrooke's home. He  is dazzled by her beauty and size and decides later to seek her out.  Unbeknownst to him she has been plotting to meet him as well, but not for  the same reason. Spenser's desire is to get her in bed by afternoon.  Helen's desire is to make him a partner in her treasure hunt for King  Edward's Lamp. Although flattered by his attention, she has her reasons for  wanting to keep it strictly platonic.<br />I was really looking forward to  another Coulter masterpiece. I was impressed with the characters and the  treasure hunting mystery; having a chance to meet up with the Sherbrookes  once again was a treat. The only thing I was disappointed in was the amount  of story time spent on Spenser and Helen's sexual antics. I understand the  premise of the story is discipline, which is what Spenser over heard Helen  and Lady Sherbrooke discussing, but I felt sex and discipline with sex was  over the top. Catherine Coulter is too talented a romance writer to depend  on erotic love scenes to make her book. Although my thoughts lean toward  too much sex in the storyline, I did enjoy the adventure of King Edward's  Lamp and all those involved in it. Ms. Coulter's characters are colorful  and fun and the atmosphere a historical work of art.	2000-07-10

Royal twins Miranda (sugar britches) and Edward have lost their mother. Now they are in danger of being political pawns, and their aunt wants them brought to safety.  That's where the Texas Cattleman's Club comes in. It's  a club of five wealthy bachelors who set out to rescue a princess, and in  the process each find true love. In book four of the series, author Metsy  Hingle leads us through a royal rescue and a new romance between Blake Hunt  and the widowed Josie. Blake, who has former Cobra training, is assigned to  enter the palace and rescue the twins right out their cribs. Next he is to  deliver them to the aunt in Royal, Texas. Naturally, when so much is at  stake, what ever can go wrong -- does. While transporting the babies, Blake  finds himself driving through the worse storm Texas has ever had, and he  has already decided babies and bachelors do not mix. Widow Josie, who Blake  renames, takes him and the babies in once she discovers them. There is  instant chemistry; physical attraction is no doubt mutual, but Cupid can't  seem to get the deeply hidden romance off the ground until both partakers'  pasts are cleared up. Do they both have that kind of patience? And will  both be accepting of each other's past lives once Blake's amnesia is  cured?<br />What a great quick read. The mixing of intrigue and romance has  always been a plus for me in category romances. I liked the way Ms. Hingle  handled the replay of the royal rescue as Blake relived it. Written in  italics, the scenes carry a presence of danger and intrigue; I found myself  whispering the scenes in my mind. The story is well written; the characters  are likable and true to form as far as I'm concerned and the plot is very  good.<br />The Texas Cattleman Club series titles are: Texas Millionaire by  Dixie Browning, Cinderella's Tycoon by Caroline Cross and Billionaire  Bridegroom by Peggy Moreland. Secret Agent Dad by Metsy Hingle is the forth  in the series and Lone Star Prince by Cindy Gerard, which was out in  December of '99, was the last title in the five part series.

After reading about him the only thing I found him guilty of was having a talent and using it to  make a difference. I think we all know that any establishment, government  or not, does not want their faults or wrong-doings pointed out... even if it  is in the best interest of others.  For those of us who have fought the  good fight, it was most likely a small establishment or department we dealt  with,  but with Vassily it was a entire country -- I admire him. In my  opinion, Russia's loss is our gain. Vassily is a talented, skilled writer.<br />The novel THE NEW SWEET STYLE starts when Alexander Korbach reaches  America on August 10, 1982, it's his 43rd birthday. Alexander Korbach isn't  his real name and he isn't really Jewish. As a child he was known as Sasha  Izhmailov.  He was born and raised in Russia with his parents, a mother  that loved him and a father who didn't. He also has a younger brother and  sister.  He tells us of a family secret that came out when he noticed his  grandmother would come bearing gifts for him only when his father left, and  how she seemed to behave as if she had some sort of ownership over him. Now  in America Alexander tries to make a life for himself as and singer and  playwright. He meets and woman named Nora and finds himself in a  relationship with her and New York City.<br />THE NEW SWEET STYLE is a  mature novel, in the sense that Vassily has his hero landing in New York,  so we can expect the usual mature predicaments with the hero and those he  comes in contact with. I found the presentation of the book different in  that the narrator doesn't just talk to the the reader, he also directs him  and points things out.

You will find a recipe for Clam Chowder  right along with one for Rabbit Stir-Fry (haven't tried that one, I prefer  petting them to eat them).<br />I promise you it doesn't matter where you  live, you will enjoy trying the best recipes in Oklahoma.

I was intrigued with his interpretation of small town life in Ireland. Although the author gives us a young woman's view through Francesca's Diary, the  narrator, Patrick Scully, leaves the strongest impression. The author's  characters are well developed and strong. The only thing I worried about in  this debut was the extent of the language and some scenes.<br />Patrick  Scully is a security guard in Dublin. He doesn't like Dublin because they  are rude and not at all like the friendly folks in his hometown of  Castlecock. When he comes home for a visit, he has a memorable experience  that will affect his life and relationship with his on again-off again  girlfriend Francesca. The reader is drawn through Scully, Francesca, and  Xavier's lives, emotions, decisions, and outcomes.<br />Mr. O'Hanlon's story  captures the struggling emotions youth experience when changing from teen  to young adult. He captures their lack of faith in life, and lets the  reader hear it through their brash, colorful words. It was an interesting  read.<br />Brenda @ Myshelf.com	2000-07-10

It's a shining new series with writers whose talents sparkle when they write about romance on the Emerald Isle. In this particular one, Moya Mahoney has just  lost a kind elderly gentleman who took her in when all her relatives died.  She is alone again... that is until American Rory O'Brien shows up at her  door looking like a soaked rat. Moya lives for being Irish, she wants to  continue the tradition of sharing Irish tales, and keeping the village in  the quaint, quiet life that it is. Guess who is trying to go forward with  some modern ideas for her life and village? You got it, Rory. Rory has his  reasons for wanting to update the small town, and I won't go in to them  because I don't want to spoil the story. The situation and closeness of  these two of course leads to a mutual attraction and I was impressed by how  the author handled it. It's a sweet romance, that is light on intimacy,  heavy on characters and backdrop; an A plus in my book. Daughter of  Ireland, along with The Irish Devil and To Marry an Irish Rogue so far make  up the tempting, romantic Irish Eyes Series!	2000-07-10

Lark is the  charming, adorable daughter of Zoë; she is the most precious character I  have come a cross in a long time! The relationship and conversations  between her and Brad are priceless and very funny.<br />Great  attention-grabbing story line! Brad is writing a column, a column that goes  to six small town papers, but no one knows it's him. So to cover it up he  asks Zoë for help, makes a major purchase and pops a question. Now wait a  minute, with that one sentence you may think you know the whole story, but  I promise you, there is a lot more to it.

If you read the title TO WED IN TEXAS and expect a typical historical Texas romance then you've never read Jodi Thomas' work. The first chapter of this gentle romance will capture you and draw you into a warm, charming,  and sometimes harrowing read.<br />Daniel McLain is a man of God, raising his  twin girls in the newly- developed and dangerous town of Jefferson, Texas.  When he appeals to his family for help, Daniel expects a family member to  arrive and help him. What he doesn't expect is a distant cousin who's  travelling companion is &quot;bad luck.&quot;  Upon arriving on a steamboat  in the most unusual way, Karlee learns that although the Civil war is over,  there are those who still want to fight, and endanger lives. Pleasing her  employer and keeping the three-year-olds safe isn't going to be easy.<br />Ms.  Thomas has written her characters so well that as I read I found instant  compassion for Daniel and the girls. My heart went out to the character  Karlee and wanted to see her triumph in more ways than one. In some parts,  the written environment took me back to the old John Wayne movies and the  realistic atmosphere and mood that was portrayed them. Ms. Thomas is an  artist of the western love story.	2000-07-10

Lyn is a literary agent who has been haunted by the death of her baby for a long time.  Lyn's friend Bridget writes children books. Bridget is tough, mad about men and loves to create scandals.  She invites Lyn to spend  Christmas in Wales with her and two other writers, James and Gareth.  Bridget has her reasons for inviting Lyn along, but my impression is that a  power much stronger than a best selling writer has something to do with her  trip.  Lyn feeling a trip would do her good accepts Bridget's offer.  Once  there she meets a neighbor who swears Lyn was sent to be a guardian and a  writer who believes she is only there to convince him to sign with her  company.  Lyn finds herself pulled into a mystery that is beyond her  control. Now her dreams are not just disturb by the haunting cries of her  own lost baby, but by someone else's child as well.  What do they want?  Why does she keep seeing people in her dreams that do not exist?<br />Susanna  Kearsley's writing impressed me greatly! The first page captured me  immediately; once drawn in I couldn't let go. Although Named the Dragon is  a contemporary novel, the historical aspects of Wales, its castles, its  myths and its royalty, along with the quotes at the beginning of each  chapter by Shakespeare, W.B. Yeats, and Lord Tennyson made the read that  much more delightful for me as a historical buff.<br />Susanna Kearsley's  writing has been compared to Barbara Michaels and Mary Stewart.  I have to  agree - it is that good.	2000-07-10

Though loaded  with statistics, the numbers are presented in a way that makes the book  read like an exciting novel.  Gladwell also gives several examples in  history, where one small change in behavior created a bigger change on a  national level.  He also studies the type of person or group that it takes  to make that change.<br />Gladwell's first example is the resurgence of the  popularity of Hush Puppies, which had long been out of fashion, and were  only sold in small shoe stores.  Suddenly, a group of teenage boys in East  Village, New York, found the cool to wear.  Word-of-mouth advertising that  these trend-setters were wearing the once-popular suede shoes set off an  epidemic of fashion change, and boys all over America had to have the  &quot;cool&quot; shoes.<br />Galdwell also examines the difference in  personality it takes to trigger the change.  For example, we all know of  Paul Revere's famous ride, but how many of us know that William Dawes made  a similar ride?  The difference was that people listened to Revere and not  to Dawes.  Why?  Revere knew so many different people.  He knew who led  which village, knew which doors to knock on to rouse the colonists.  Dawes  didn't know that many people and therefore could only guess which people to  give his message.<br />There are several other phenomena that Gladwell  examines, showing the small things that spark a change, from the dip in the  New York City crime rate to the correlation between depression, smoking and  teen suicide.  If you want to change the world for the better, this book  will give you an insight into the methods that work, and those that will  backfire.  It's all in knowing where to find The Tipping Point.<br />Jo @  MyShelf.Com	2000-05-07

While Ben is  chasing conspiracy theories, the author weaves in two other frightening  story lines. Christy Kirk, a young reporter, investigates the  militarization of white supremacy groups and the African American  resistance. LaRosa Smith, a beautiful African American woman, is the top  advisor to the vice-president, who is running for president in the 2000  election. All three stories blend together as the plot reaches a stunning  climax.<br />Ben Kavner is the most likable but unlikely hero ever. He is a  combination of intellectual, dreamer, lovesick-pup, and an oddball all  rolled into one. You just can't help but love the guy. The other characters  were somewhat realistic--likable.

I found the New American cheese to be a fabulous  book stuffed full of information about our American cheesemakers along with  some scrumptious, tempting cheese recipes, and if that isn't enough, she  has also included some vivid, delicious-looking photos by Martin Jacobs to  tempt us even more.<br />The book begins with the evolution of cheese. It  goes into the types of cheese, such as cow's milk, sheep's milk, and goat's  milk cheese. She explains to us where cheese came from and how it grew in  America. Then she follows through with a page of descriptions and even lets  us in on how to pair the right cheese with the right wine. On the  informative side, there is a reference guide pertaining to the types of  cheeses presently being made from the fresh to the very hard. She also  includes a glossary and a list of cheesemakers around the country. The  author, with pictures of the different cheesemakers' labels, briefly tells  of each one and includes some mouth-watering recipes.

US	51337956	R1I3JY1XQSIV7	1890768227	39919378	Cat's Claw	Books	4	3	3	N	N	An interesting mystery series	\\"Cat's Claw\\" is the fifth Cassidy McCabe Mystery. In Ms. Matthews' latest whodunit therapist Cassidy McCabe is getting acquainted with her cat loving, hypersensitive, timid neighbor, Olivia, when something goes deadly  wrong.  Personally speaking, Olivia lucked out in getting Cassidy as one of  her neighbors instead of being completely surrounded by superior fuddy  duds. Cassidy feels compassion for Olivia and her feral (untamed) cats so  when a tragedy occurs it's the ever brave, kind-hearted, levelheaded  Cassidy who tries to solve it.  Also in the storyline, Zach, Cassidy's  husband goes undercover as a different person in his latest reporter  assignment. It makes his character a bit unlikable in this mystery. I  admired the fact that the author has him apologizing to his wife and son  for his moments of being a lousy husband and father. This is something only  a real man can do.  The characters come across as realistic; they aren't  politically correct, perfectionists; they are normal. In fact, Alex  Matthews' characters seemed more in touch with reality than most.  I like  it that Cassidy doesn't waste my time trying to hide behind a tough  exterior. She thinks things out and deals with them.  As far as solving the  mystery, I was pretty sure I knew the murderer, but the false leads gave me  doubts till the end.<br />Brenda @ MyShelf.Com	2000-05-07

Cassidy and Zach seemed very real. Her cat, although not her sleuthing partner, helps to ground the characters with actions all pet owners can identify with.  I can  understand why Alex Matthews won the 1999 Readers Choice Award for BEST  CHARACTER IN A SERIES. The entire mystery series is worth reading.	2000-01-02
