I wanted to know the Rebel Beatnik turned Eastern Orthodox Hieromonk (a monk who is also an ordained Priest) by his own words when he was writing a 12 year correspondence to his spiritual son Alexey Young.<br /><br />The book starts in the mid 1960's with the personal remembering of Alexey Young when he was interested in Russian Orthodoxy. It was then that he met Eugene Rose, a layman working at an Orthodox bookstore, who later became Father Seraphim Rose.<br /><br />Each chapter after that is each years writings, starting with the year 1970, from Father Seraphim Rose to Alexey Young. Before or after each letter is some background information from Alexey Young to help fill in why Father Seraphim Rose was writing about some issues.<br /><br />We can see the development of Father Seraphim Rose thought the years becoming less overbearing to more Christ-like helping Alexey Young to first becoming a missionary in Oregon to later Priest.<br /><br />Issues about Church history, the Soviet takeover of Russian Orthodoxy, problems with the Ultra-Orthodox, spiritual growth & personal discernment, as well as many other topics are expressed in Father Seraphim Rose's own hand.<br /><br />If you have read \\"Father Seraphim Rose, His Life & Works\\", this book will give a more personal reflection to fill in the blanks.	2005-03-20

Most see it as a time of hardship, unnecessary discipline, old fashion, from the old world, or many other negative views. Another semi-unknown factor are the different pratices of the Western Church (Roman Catholic or some early Protestant) from the Eastern Orthodox Church.<br /><br />Dr. Thomas Hopko does an excellent job in clarifying what Great Lent is all about for the Eastern Orthodox Church. That this season is a time of spiritual joy to act out the life, death, & resurrection of Jesus Christ. Throughout the book, Dr. Thomas Hopko uses the church's historical tradition from Biblical, Liturgical, & Patristic writings with modern teachings to give a well rounded guide to uplift & strength ones spiritual vision.<br /><br />The book is designed with 40 short chapters to match the Lenten period to help the reader to meditate on a chapter a day. I don't know of any other book that is as well thought out with this in mind. Take the 40 day path to your own resurrection with the wisdom of the Ancient Christian Church by reading this book.	2005-03-19

S.A. Nigosian goes to great length to get the exact information from many varied sources, which at times either reveals too much information in short paragraphs or causes certain vagueness. For example the dates of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster) are from 6000 BC from some Greek sources to appox. 650-600 BC. Other problem is that I never saw such a fast rendering of the history of ancient Iran in so few pages. At times a short paragraph per King or Kingdom. Maybe a chart or map would of help to clarify this information. In another area S.A. Nigosian uses the baptism rites of the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church as an example of the Zoroastrian rite without ever revealing the Zoroastrian rite itself.<br /><br />Could it be that most other religious history books cut too many corners & round off the information? Maybe to write the whole truth will always reveal the imperfections of history. Other than that the book was a pure delight going through the general practices, festivals, & calendar events of ancient & modern Zoroastrianism.<br /><br />There are no photographs or visual information in this book that could help reveal certain clothing or life styles of the Zoroastrian faith. In fact I did meet a Parsi (a modern Zoroastrian from Bombay India) at a Jews for Jesus table at Cal State Fullerton California around the mid 1980's & saw his shirt that contain the chords to store his good & evil deeds, but I still would like to see a photograph of a fire temple & the rites performed.<br /><br />In other words I had a few problems with the style of the book, mostly due to lack of visual information, but its well worth the price if your looking for a grand overview of Zoroastrianism.	2004-12-09

Though containing the basics of the need for Western Rite Orthodoxy, this booklet is more of an apologetic nature rather than a historical essay.<br /><br />Basically the Western Rite within the Eastern Orthodox Church is still rather small, but with the continued problems of the American Episcopal Church & the fragmentation of the Continuing Anglican movement, a booklet like this could at least show an option or a means to continue to celebrate Christianity in a form that most western Catholics would recognize: Pre-Vatican-II but in a native language rather than Latin, or High Anglicanism. Both types would have changes in the Nicene Creed without the filioque (and the son) & a stronger Epiclesis with the elements of the mass. This booklet reminds me of its bigger brother \\"Becoming Orthodox: A Journey to the Ancient Christian Faith\\" by Peter E. Gillquist.	2004-02-19

Is there something in the middle of this question? Yes, there is the fantastic second biography of Eugene Rose called \\"Father Seraphim Rose: His Life & Works\\", by Hieromonk Damascene. First published under the title \\"Not of This World: The Life & Teachings of Fr. Seraphim Rose\\" when the monastery book publisher 'St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood' was in between jurisdictions which caused a near perfect first biography to self destruct at the ending with questionable motives. Now corrected under the supervision of the Serbian Orthodox Church with the blessings of several Orthodox jurisdictions, this renewed almost resurrected book has added unpublished writings from Fr. Seraphim, new reminiscences with photographs, & updated expanded source notes.<br />The book is well made for a paperback but because of its size, over 1000 pages, one should be careful when reading. On the front cover is a great facial color photograph of Fr. Seraphim Rose in his monastic robe, looking over his shoulder with his long hair & bread. The rest of the photographs within the book are black & white, taken from Eugene's childhood throughout the years to his priesthood & finally death.<br />As with the pervious book, it's well written & very easy to read that the amount of the pages doesn't become a factor. Orthodox or Russian terms that can't quite be translated into a single English word are totally explained for the average reader. The chronological order is very organized & doesn't mix up the time periods as much as other biographies.<br />HIS LIFE: Eugene Rose was born on 1934 in San Diego California, the third & last child of the Rose family, which later moved to Caramel California. Eugene's Father was a non-practicing Roman Catholic & his Mother a church hopping Protestant. When Eugene came of age, his mother saw his great promise of a mind & she tried to encourage him with the American Dream, but Eugene rebelled within the beatnik movement of the 1950's because he saw the underlying Nihilist currents overtaking the society. Eugene graduated from Pomona College & then studied under Alan Watts, the Ex-Anglican Priest turned pop culture Zen Buddhist, & finally Chinese philosophy & language under the University of California Berkeley. Eugene never became a professor because of the westernized limitations of the University system, but instead took up odd jobs so that he could write his opus \\"The Kingdom of Man and the Kingdom of God\\" (which he never finished)after he converted to Russian Orthodoxy. Later under the guidance of Archbishop John Maximovitch (a few years after his death he became an Orthodox Saint in North America) & with Gleb Podmoshensky, a Russian immigrant, they started a brotherhood called \\"St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood\\" where Eugene & Gleb owned an Orthodox bookstore & published the magazine \\"Orthodox Word\\". After the death of Archbishop John Maximovitch, they left everything behind & started their own 'Skete' (small monastery) in the middle of the forest near Platina California following the Russian Optina & Valaam traditions. Here they wrote many books & letters to encourage the Orthodox Christians trapped behind the iron curtain (communist lands of eastern Europe & Russia) & influence many Americans to reconsider the cultural limitations of western Christianity. Within a few years both become monks & later priests, Eugene became Fr. Seraphim Rose (after St. Seraphim of Sarov Russia) & Gleb became Fr. Herman (after St. Herman of Alaska). Sadly Fr. Seraphim died in 1982 at the young age of 48.<br />HIS WORKS: Fr. Seraphim Rose wrote many books & this biography goes over the general topics & the reasons why they were written. These books include \\"Genesis, Creation & Early Man\\", \\"Orthodoxy & the Religion of the Future\\", \\"The Soul After Death\\", as well as many others.<br /><br />What makes this book so profound is to learn of the insight, the commitment, & the cross carrying power ofFr. Seraphim Rose. His prophetic vision of what was to become of American culture & the means of transformation to overcome it. A magnificent spiritual journey captured in just over a 1000 pages..

Macarius is one of its victims, maybe a mix of two different persons from around 385-430 AD, one an Egyptian desert father &amp; the other a Syrian monk, therefore the term 'Pseudo' is always used before this collection of writings. Because of this mix up, it is not know if this set of writings were condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431 AD as a part of the heretical movement called `Messalians' which emphasized prayer rather than the sacraments, or if these writings are `Orthodox' &amp; have greatly influenced eastern Christian spirituality, &amp; later Pietism &amp; Methodism.<br />Within this spiritual masterpiece, Macarius writes about the `Brotherhood' with its duties &amp; instructions of living, a sort of monastic manual. Then the writings focus of the primary need to follow Jesus Christ, under the control of the Holy Spirit, while grazing directly at God the Father by direct experience. This is done chiefly by prayer with 12 steps of progression to perfection that causes a 'Sober Intoxication' that affects first the single person, than the community at large.<br />Paulist Press does another fine job creating an easy to read, well-made paperback that can fit nicely with the other books from the fantastic series `Classics of Western Spirituality'. Highly recommend.	2004-02-10

He came from a religious family where his brother St Basil the Great was the streamliner of the eastern liturgy still in used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church during the Great Fast before Pascha (Easter). Many believe that Gregory was married with Theosebeia before becoming a Bishop. He wrote many books, \\"The Life of Moses\\" being his most famous & influential where he tries to find allegorical interpretations & the mystical meanings beyond the normal reading of the texts.<br />This book may make great reading for most people to reveal the many layers of the Bible by its many different uses of symbolism. Or better written: How to read the life of Moses & reinterpret it to exam your life & become closer to God.<br />There are many levels of spiritually within the Eastern Orthodox Christian Mystical tradition; interpreting & applying the Bible to help with your spiritual life is but one method. If you're into silent prayer & trying to remove allegory from your thought processes, this book may get in the way. In other words: there is a time to apply the many levels of the Bible to your life & there is a time to clean your mind from its process to experience God directly. Find out which level you're at or which works for you, & see if this fine written ancient book of wisdom can help.	2004-02-09

Herman, they entered the Northern California forests to create a monastery & print shop called \\"St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood\\", writing books that have effected & enlighten Eastern Europe & Russia during the Soviet oppression.<br />As with other reviews, the book is fantastic as long as it focuses on Fr. Seraphim Rose's mission in life, with great photographs during his short but productive life. But once Fr, Seraphim Rose dies, the book turns into a private agenda about the monastery's fall out with ROCOR (Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia). The Great News is that the monastery is now under the Serbian Orthodox Church & the book has been extremely edited, deleting this major fault.

Was Moscow the third Rome (a Christian Empire guarding the Christian Orthodox Faith: Rome fell in 410, Constantinople in 1453, & Moscow in 1917)? How did the Russian Empire fall? Is a Christian Theocracy still possible?<br /><br />2. Was Czar Nicholas II a Saint, an untrained prince turned single focus Tsar, or \\"Bloodly\\" Nicholas?<br /><br />3. Who was Rusputin? Was he a hedonistic heretic, a persecuted Staret, or a doubled face sinner/saint?<br /><br />Commentary: After finishing \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\" by Robert K. Massie, most of these questions go unanswered, but at least my options are clarified. The book is very well written for easy reading, almost too well written...in some areas it reads like a novel: over detaining certain information that may not be historical fact. This Novel-ling of history deals mostly with the main characters: what they wear, what facial features or expressions they had. The words that may or may not of been spoken are colored with emotion which adds to the story, but is it history?<br />Lets look at historical biographies this way:<br /><br />First, you have a biography that is a history book. It lists just the facts; this can be rather boring to read.<br /><br />Second, there are books like \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\" that add a little favor to soften the read, or to act out the history with people talking in 3rd person.<br /><br />Third, there are books like \\"I Claudius\\" by Robert Graves that are fictional autobiographies: fictional writings with historical facts intertwined.<br /><br />Only you the reader know what type of books you may enjoy, or what you really what from a book.

After a few e-mail exchanges I was told about the Indian Christian Mystic Sundar Singh. This biography from A.J. Appasamy, who knew the Mystic during his many travels, wrote a very easy to read book that pages fly by.<br /><br />Sundar Singh was born September 3, 1889 in a rich Sikh family from Punjab India. As a child he wanted to know the truth & questioned his local teachers. They told him that he would get the answer in time, but Sundar had a quick mind & would not except the standard answers:<br /><br />\\"Excuse me, but I cannot believe this, for if I am a part of Brahma (Godhead or Ultimate Reality), or am myself Brahma, then I should be incapable of having any Maya (illusion). But if Maya is possible in Brahma, then Brahma is no longer Brahma, for he has been subordinated to Maya. Hence Maya is stronger than Brahma himself, & Maya will then not be Maya but will be a reality that has overcome Brahma, & we shall have to think of Brahma himself as Maya, & this is blasphemy.\\"<br /><br />Sundar wanted the truth so much that he states:<br /><br />...I prayed that if there was a God at all He would reveal Himself to me, & show me the way of salvation, & end this unrest of my soul. I firmly made up my mind that, if this prayer was not answered, I would before daylight go down to the railway, & place my head on the line before the incoming train.\\"<br /><br />Then instead of Krishna or Buddha, Jesus Christ appeared to him & he became a Christian Sadhu (Holy Man, Wandering Friar, or Religious Teacher). He then spread the Gospel around India into Nepal & Tibetan boarder. Later in his life he visited England, Burma, China, Japan, America, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Scandinavia, & Holland where many heard of him.<br /><br />Sundar's teachings were very simple, to the point, & like Jesus Christ, he used many parables. He was associated with the Church of England, but did not become a priest in order to reach all the religions & many Christian denominations. He had many mystical visions seeing the saints around Jesus Christ & meet a Christian hermit around Tibet named Maharishi, who claimed he was over 200 years old. Many don't know if this was a vision, a real hermit who was just old, or if Sundar made it up.<br /><br />After trying for years to make it into Tibet (he normally visited the outskirts), he finally made it in 1929, only to disappear.<br /><br />The book discusses his teachings, main sayings, & other important information that gives a good picture of Sundar.with the Church of England, but did not become a priest in order to reach all the religions & many Christian denominations.

This semi-easy to read book is the 1st of 4 volumes of his Opus about the Philosophy of Symbolic Forms. The 1st volume deals with language, the 2nd with Mythical Thought, the 3rd with the Phenomenology of Knowledge, & the 4th with the Metaphysics of Symbolic Forms.<br />As most people understand western philosophical history, Plato was the 1st to make a systematic philosophical system which made the Ideal or \\"Form\\" of thought an Axiom of reality. This way of understanding reality created more problems than answers until Descartes came up with his Rational Axiom: \\"I think therefore I am\\", which many felt was an overstatement lacking Empirical experience. Immanuel Kant solved this problem with a Synthesis (Union) of the Rational & the Empirical. In other words, the human mind functions & understands reality in a certain rational way by uniting with common experience. Immanuel Kant came up with 12 different \\"Categories of Thought\\" which was based on Aristotle's Categories from an abstraction of language. Ernst Cassirier goes a step further in stating that the mind abstracts reality by use of symbols which are taught from certain historical cultural groups & as with the philosopher Michel Foucault, both reveal the disunity of modern science's methods & terminology. Unlike Michel Focault difficult book \\"The Order of Things, An Archaeology of the Human Sciences\\", Ernst Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms is easier to read & focuses on the main issue of the human mind's use of symbols. This book requires a certain knowledge of philosophical history & terms, & is not for a philosophy beginner. For a start on Ernst Cassirier, try his smaller, easy to read, & to the point book \\"Language & Myth\\" for a taste of this mind opening philosophy.	2003-12-03

The book is beautifully done in hard back, with a single photograph of each finished product. Some cooking books have the advantage of showing each step or at least the main steps of a recipe, which this cooking book is missing, but there are added features that make up for this. The book is section off with a certain taste, spice, or sauce as the core which Ming Tsai calls \\"The Master Recipe\\". Then meat, chicken, seafood, or vegetable dishes are shown using this core or \\"Master Recipe\\". What is really interesting is in the corner of each page is a list of the perfect wine to match each meal. Some recipes seem puzzling to me; one requires a certain tea to match with the other spices, would any normal orange tea do? Other recipes may require going to a special food market. Amazon.com is offering the hard back copy for a great price. Excuse me while I go shopping for a few of the ingredients...	2003-11-25

The study of the Early Church Fathers? The continual tradition or theology of the Church Fathers? If the last definition is right, then Matthew the Poor's \\"The Communion of Love\\" will give a clear refreshing read. Most ancient Patristics dealt with defending against that days heresy or refining the dogmas or mystery of the Church. Some did write about how to read the Bible, the meaning behind certain verses, & how to live your Life with spiritual power, but most lacked a vision of modern problems, or how modern thinking (Rationality or Subjectivity) could cloud spiritual reality.<br />Matthew the Poor is a modern Coptic monk, part of the Oriental Orthodox Christian Church. He was a rich pharmacist living in Egypt, who just after World War II gave up everything & went to the desert to start a monastery. In 1971 he was one of 3 men to be nominated to become the Coptic Pope (not like the Roman Catholic Pope, but the highest Bishop in Egypt). Before his death he could heal people & feed the animals by his hands (like St. Francis of the Roman Catholic or St. Seraphim of the Russian Orthodox).

The prayer came into BEING during the early Egyptian Monastic period of the 3rd or 4th century when the One Holy Apostolic Catholic Church became legal in the Roman Empire, but was in a state of BECOMING until the finished prayer was defended by St. Gregory Palamas in the 14th century. The highlight for me was the writings from St. Symeon the New Theologian, about the 4 methods of prayer (Using Images, Fighting Thoughts, Silence, & Discipline under an Abbot) which helped me remove imagination during prayer. These are not the 4 methods as in bodily prayer, attentive prayer, prayer of the feelings, or spiritual prayer, which are explained by other Church Fathers within this fine book. An introduction or easier book to read about this subject mater is \\"The Way of the Pilgrim\\" which is also sold by Amazon.com.	2003-10-10

Don't worry, it's still easy to read. Maybe a little harder to read than Karl Jasper, but this is not Hegel's Outer Limits of personal idealist words. The most important historical highlights of human expression in language is written with clear insight that only Ernst Cassirer can do. I would consider this Ernst Cassirer's intermediate book with the classic \\"Philosophy of Symbolic Forms\\" being his Opus. If I may suggest: start with \\"Language & Myth\\", than \\"Essay on Man\\", & finish with \\"Philosophy of Symbolic Forms\\".	2003-10-10

Cookbook	Books	4	6	9	N	N	Repeat with Less Salt	Over all a great book: easy to read, well photographed, many sub topics (Rubs & Marinades are the best sections)...but how to set up the Bar B.Q. is repeated over & over again with the same photos. Is this to give the compete ABC's or was this book written for beginner cooks? I tried several recipes, all turned out great for spice minded people (the Rosemary Brick Chicken is to die for), but I learned to use half the salt, or at times use twice the meat with the same amount of suggested spice. The book is worth buying, but test the recipes with yourself & a special other before inviting guests.	2003-10-10

Ernst Cassirer is a philosophical genius who writes to the common man without all the typical wasted German idealist wording. Help yourself to question the beginning, the history, & the continuing changes of how language & myth intertwine, & limit our human experience.

The book starts with his Theosophical Society upbringing under Besant & Leadbeater when Madam Blavatsky had already pass away, but basic historial details of the Society are mention. I am not sure if the author was fair to each of the leaders or just over described, or focused too much on the historical \\"Dirt\\", specially on Leadbeater. Sometimes the book jumped back & forth in time, & I had to reread to sort out the chronological order. Also Krishnamurti's affair with Rosalind Williams Rajagopal, was the information from Rosalind daughter's book or was it independently researched? In the end the book revealed many things about Krishnamurti that his written conversations did not reveal. For example: before I read this biography, I looked at Krishnamurti as a forced messiah turned nihilist philosopher teaching practical mysticism, but in the end I see a man still under certain influences (entities or Kundalini) while claiming to be free (another paradox). The book was very enjoyable, but read it with an open mind & do what Krishnamutri would do: question it & find out for yourself.	2003-09-22

The past 2 books, \\"Facing East\\" & \\"At the Corner of East & Now\\" were written with a clean, clear, & personal view of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in America, but this book dealt with fictional characters from the past that seem out of place. How can you write a book of fiction when you are dealing with the most ontological axiom of the human physic where God meets his conscious creation? Why not write about factual characters? There is almost 2000 years of Church history through several cultural/language groups of factual people that lived & practice this religious/spiritual lifestyle who could of been written about. Also there are many Church Saints & Christian Mystics that have given us information on Mystical prayer (silent prayer or Jesus prayer) that could give us a more balance & fuller perspective on spiritual transformation. May I suggest studying some of the Patristical writings of St. Symeon the New Theologian or St. Theophan the Recluse before, after, or instead of this book.	2003-05-15

To Plato the axiom was the \\"Good\\" or \\"Ideal\\", to Descartes the \\"Thinking Self\\", to Kant the \\"Categories of Thought\\" etc...this book is completely different. Karl Jaspers started out with a psychiatry degree but after World War I became Professor of Philosophy at Heidelberg, but during the mid 1930's with the raise of Hitler & Nazi Germany, he had to leave his post due to his Jewish wife & anti-Nazi stand. After World war II, he returned to Heidelberg to give a series of lectures dealing with \\"The Question of German Guilt\\", this book being a written version of those lectures. Karl Jaspers writes very clean & precise while not using the difficult words like Kant's \\"Transcendental Manifold\\" or Heideger's \\"Dasein\\" etc...therefore sit back, get a cup of coffee & enjoy another very well written, easy to read philosophy book. Within these lectures Karl Jaspers tries to help his fellow German people to struggle through their current defeat & the Nuremberg trials by giving the reasons behind the raise of Nazi Germany, the dates when certain people either left or were trapped within the new social system, the defeat, & current responsibility of certain individuals or the German people as a whole. Karl Jaspers then lists 4 categories of guilt & degrees of responsibility: Criminal guilt (the commitment of certain acts & judgment by trial), Political guilt (how involved one is within one's government), moral guilt (your own private or circle of friends consciences), & metaphysical guilt (an universally shared responsibility to choose to live rather than protest evil). Each category is then explain in great detail of its pros & cons of legality, & which categories have more of a proof of guilt. I enjoyed the book, I hope you will too.	2003-05-06

Books	1	15	29	N	Y	MisInformation Misused	While I was exploring the \\"Friends & Favorites\\" section of Amazon.com, I found a review about this book. The book looked interesting because for most of my life I have been studying the major religions & philosophies, & have been trying to free my mind from the effects of Americana. The book itself does have its high points, there was a large listing of when the US government used its military to enforced its policies, surprising every 2 to 3 years in some areas, mostly in Central America & the Caribbean. The listing was very general in the details, but lacking the reasons why. I have seen these listings before, normally in reference to certain Presidents (for example Teddy Roosevelt) or doctrines (for example the Monroe Doctrine). There was a chapter of American greed or Corporate Globalization, but as someone wrote in another review, \\"America never forces people to buy a burger\\". I can relate to the Americanization, really Globalization, because I have been in Israel in 1990 & was surprise to see McDonalds & Wendy's fast food, even if they had no cheese burgers due to Jewish kosher laws. Later I visited the Ukraine in 1998 thinking I would escape the influence of the USA only to find all the major eastern Asian companies selling their electronic goods. The saddest point was when a certain rock group was singing in English \\"I am a Barbie doll, living in a Barbie world...\\" via the radio & TV, which was the only thing I had heard in total English during the visit. There is also a chapter dealing with the American Hero which also helped me to question the concepts of the American Dream & other issues. The book was too general to bring the main issue into focus but what made me question its value was the publisher \\"Misinformation\\". Check out the publishers symbol & the listing of their other books by clicking the publishers name on the browser & see that they all are very negative. Also see what other books come up during the search. The whole thing became a mind game that I didn't want to play. No, it's better to free your mind from any use of negative universal symbols, or reading a list of things done wrong by a certain country. All nations that become the today's super power will be blamed for something. To free ourselves from Americana it's better to read the philosophers or mystics that teach us to forgive, care, & reach out in truth to all the world. In other words: no matter what a nation does, it's up to each of us to make a difference.that I didn't want to play.

US	35738100	RYPUHBPN3T6V3	0809126591	76453727	Maximus Confessor: Selected Writings (Classics of Western Spirituality) (English and Ancient Greek Edition)	Books	5	58	61	N	N	Read a Little at a Time	St. Maximus the Confessor lived during the time when the eastern half of the One Holy Apostolic Catholic Church was battling a heresy called the Monothelite controversy dealing between the unity or duality of will in relation to nature. Today many think the issue was due to cultural language limitations between Greek & Arabic, political problems within the Byzantine empire, & the rapid spread of Islam. Either way St. Maximus was the champion of Orthodoxy defending the view that Jesus was fully God & fully human in his incarnation, therefore he had 2 natures, & each nature had a will. Jesus expressed these ideas when he said \\"Not my will be done, but thy will be done\\" verses \\"I am in the Father\\" which pointed in the other direction. The 1st section of the book deals with St. Maximus's trial before the Byzantine Emperor where many false witness accused the Saint of being against the Emperor. St. Maximus quickly & rightly goes to the source of the matter & asks for proof, of course there is none, its all hear-say (heresy). For historical note: St. Maximus was finally accused, had his tongue & one of his hands cut off, & sent into exile where he shortly died. The masterpiece of this book is the 100 Chapters of Love, where St. Maximus takes several scriptures & many writings from the Church Fathers, & explains in great detail what Love is. The 1st time I read this book, I tried to read it as a whole book, this was a mistake. The 2nd time I read it, I read a verse at a time. St. Maximus writes with such tight exact meaning, that each word is overwhelming. Therefore for maximum (Maximus) enjoyment, read this section like a poem & then pray or reflex on each line. Another section is a great commentary on the Lord's Prayer: \\"Our Father\\". Each verse gets a few paragraphs of detail. This book is not for the soft hearted or for the easy to read crowd, but for people that enjoy deep books.	2003-04-22

No, it was written by a Church to other parts of the same Church, read in that Church during the time when Christianity was illegal & most people didn't know how to read. After 400 years the Church finally agreed what books were to be put into the New Testament, then came the legal spilt of 1054, then the printing press, then the literacy of humanity. At last after the fall of communism & fragmentation of the Eastern Church, the original authors have written their book into English for the American public. Is it an evangelical tool? Yes it is, it always was. Is it really Orthodox? Yes it is, with historical back-up notes from the ancient Church Fathers & the Church as it exists now. I can personally write that the Old Testament is also coming out, my Deacon & Greek teacher is translating from the Septuagint the books of 1st & 2nd Chronciles (3rd & 4th Kings), & the book of Proverbs. I have seen some of the pages in his computer. Yes, the Eastern Orthodox doesn't use the New Testament in the same fashion as in American Christianity, we pray the scriptures rather than study the scriptures, but the Church is reaching out to meet the modern world.	2003-04-11

This is one of them, I had the book custom made from a computer print out & then hard bound. Written between World War One & World War Two, in 1933, I am surprised on how well Karl Jaspers understands humanity trapped within modern technology with its so-called promises yet in the end traps. The book explains the origin of modern techonolgy & how it developed into the present state of existence that humanity now finds itself. The middle secion deals with the Limits of the Life Order (Humanity as a Mass), the Will in the Whole (the State & Education), & the Decay & Possibilities of the Mind (Culture & Mental Creation: Art, Science, & Philosophy) and then the book ends with our Present existence in the fields of Sociology, Psychology, & Anthropology, & what humanity can become. A great find & here it is in Amazon.com as a special order.	2003-04-03

I may of read about 4 to 5 Martin Heidegger books & this book flowed because it was more easy to read. Well, the first part of the book was easy, got a little lost in the \\"Being As Thinking\\" section. Heidegger's philosophy, minus the so-called \\"Certain Influences\\", helped me give up my Platonic ways of thinking. Heidegger starts off trying to ask the most basic axiom \\"Why are there BEINGs at all instead of Nothing\\" goes through a brief history of the main words, tears the words & main question apart, & puts the words & question back together again in a more \\"Primate\\", \\"Basic\\", or \\"Historical\\" understanding. Then he explains how BEING turns into BECOMING (how things change), APPEARANCE (how things influence our senses), THINKING (How & what we think about our experience), & the OUGHT (The way things \\"Should\\" or \\"Could\\" BE). Basic conclusion: Western Philosophy started out correct with the pre-Platonic philosophers asking what BEING was & then after Plato the debate became about mind over matter while losing the original meaning & questions about BEING (Reality). A Must Read!	2003-04-03

This is Heidegger's Opus written in 1928 should be read after \\"Intro to Metaphysics\\" or some of his other smaller easier writings. The book has many great questions & thoughts about how BEING Human is trapped within BEING (Space, Existence) & TIME, but the book gets bogged down with Heidegger's own personal language. In other words: BEING & TIME is as hard to read as the philosophers Hegel or Kant. After finishing the book you may find the need to leave behind any form of Idealism & the many other traps of western philosophical history, or better written: \\"To Become Authentic\\" & discover your own means or method of thinking.<br /><br />Not for the Philosophical Beginner.	2003-03-05
