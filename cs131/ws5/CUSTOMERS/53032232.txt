Rerun of the old Ace paperback double novel marketing ploy.  As pot-boilers go, it is better than average.  Two police procedurals, each with lots of local color.  The blubs say they were both written jointly by this husband and wife, but the stories are so similar and one is so much better witten than the other, that one of the two authors should be hiding in shame.	2005-03-14

It provides an insider's view of some things happening within the American vocation of \\"historian.\\"  As a sort of intellectual voyeurism, this book is readable, engrossing, and even fun for one outside this ivory tower. <br /> <br />But what does it mean?  What is implied about the condition of the American academy, the news business?  For me, the book indicates that the Bush administration is correct--they do create their own reality.  The American public is the target of the biggest propaganda machine since Joe Stalin. <br /> <br />I hope somebody will review this book and tear it apart the way Michael P. Johnson rendered \\"Designs Against Charleston: The Trial Record of the Denmark Vesey Slave Conspiracy of 1822.\\"  (See chapter 7 of \\"Historians in Trouble\\")  If not, then I am afraid, very afraid.	2005-02-11

I guess I can be generous to the other reviews.  They seem to be written soon after this book was released. <br /> <br />The errors are not just with the maps.  This is a poster child for sloppy historical workmanship.  A review of this book by Michael P. Johnson, in \\"William and Mary Quarterly\\" Oct '01 completly shredded the book and stated that the actual record indicated exactly the reverse of Pearson's conslusion.  The Johnson review earned the prize from the Organization of American Historians for the best journal article of that year in all of American History, in spite of the fact that the President of that organization had written a blurb for the back cover praising the book. <br /> <br />The Pearson could not even get it right in the book title--there was no trial. <br /> <br />The current price for this book is so high because the publisher withdrew the book and tried to recover all copies.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-10

Nostalgia for the days of The Dodgers and the Giants and the Yankees, all in New York City, all the best teams in baseball.  Italicized interludes describe a boy growing up in Boston as a Dodger fan.<BR>Other reviewers have said this part is autobiographical.<br />The plot is Jacky Robinson's first year at the Dodgers and he needs a body guard.  This body guard some critics have called just a card-board import from Parker's Spencer series.  I think he is much more.<br />This is fictional part is the source of my nausea.  I am a old white male who grew up in America in the time described in this novel.  The author is a white male.  The book attempts to give a window into what it was like to be a Negro adult then.  When a black man could be killed for accidently bumping into a white woman on the sidewalk.  The killers of Emmet Till are facing federal trial again in the near future.  In 1947 they would have been congratulated for upholding the standards of the community.<br />America in 1947 had much to be proud of.  But the whole truth requires confession that we were also a sick society.<br />It would take a black man, adult in 1947, to judge the accuracy of this book.  But it comes close enough for me to cry there is some hope, we have changed for the better.	2004-06-09

But is a well functioning formula and is only familiar if you have read many of the others.<br />This entry in the saga is different in that the protagonist is an older man with ordinary problems of just getting along with his wife and directing a couple of children who are giving a father the usual problems along with a depressed business economy and in-laws who don't like him.<br />Then fate smacks him around and he learns to exist on the margins of society as a beggar and outlaw and finally as a ship carpenter's helper.<br />An enjoyable read that holds together well, without reference to other books in the saga.  Interestingly, the geography of the action takes place mostly in areas that have been neglected in the other works in this series.  That is why it is a disappointment that the maps at the beginning of the book identify almost none of the places in the book. <br />Clearly this one needs a direct sequel to reunite the protagonist with his older son and rescue the homeland from the corrupt government.	2004-04-12

I am not a fan of Fox or NFL football, so I was ignorant of the author's background before I read it.  I seem to me like a first novel, by someone who has watched many action movies, but read little.<BR>Plot was unbelieveable, the bad guys just too bad, the good guys just too lucky.<br />And the editing was not much better.  The good guys are running all over the country in a F350 diesel truck.  This is the biggest pickup made by Ford.  Suddenly their vehicle becomes a Suburban, a much different set of wheels made by General Motors, and then magically it is a dually F350 again.<br />Maybe worth the time to read it, but not worth investing the cover price.	2004-03-04

No real surprises.  Even the new dog is bored.<br />I think Parker is getting weary of this series.

But I just could not care about any of the people in these stories.<br />The scary part was to think about the education system of Yale, Johns Hopkins, Iowa Writers and other institutional names that were dropped on the jacket blurbs, but no one cared enough to distinguish between Acrostic and acronym or mnemonic, near the bottom of page two.	2003-08-05

Oddly, the science is off to the point of silliness.  For example, the mad scientist produces copies of himself so he can do many things at once.

Pollack spends nearly the last third of the book building an strong case against the invasion now.  The serious threat to the safety and security of America is way beyond Iraq.  <br />\\"It would be best to hold off on plans for an invasion until al-Qa'ada is iradicated.\\"  He calls regime change in Iraq a <BR>distraction from the war on terriorism.  Further, he states a successful invasion of Iraq will require the support of Egypt, and general stability among the other Arab nations.  Pollack identifies the central problem in the mid-East is not Iraq or Saddam, but the Israeli-Palestinian bedlam.<br />This book, taken as a whole, is not the case for US invasion of Irag now.  It is a strong argument that President Bush may become the biggest April Fool in history.	2003-03-18

This was a waste of my money, and a bigger demonstration of time wasted as a foolish fan.  I can't believe I actually read the whole thing.  The central character (and only character with any development) is a teenage boy.  I thought this was perhaps aimed at the teenage market, like Heinlein's Space Cadet series.<BR>But the teens of today would find it just too boring.  There is some interesting discussion of honor and philosophy at the beginning but it quickly devolves into a going nowhere travelogue.  The planet has at least five sentient races, with hints of perhaps even more.  But they are nearly all indifferent to the protagonist and the reader is left with an indifference to them as well.  The final scene has been built up as having heavy political and social import for the entire planet, but it is played out as a ho-hum, \\"well kid it is about time you got home; here is a list of your chores now get with it.\\"<br />As another reviewer said, Silverberg sleepwalked through this one.	2002-09-23

I loved it. Further reading in Tepper's works seemed repetitive. Fresco is fresh and very funny.  Fresco is placed in a science-fiction universe of the now, a world we all know.  Humans have sent out space exploration machines beyond the solar system and this attacts the attention of a multi-specie space confederation.  It seems we are throwing garbage over the fence.  First contact is not with one group of aliens, but at least five different species, all with their own agenda for using humans for their own purpose.  None are totally beneficial to humanity.<br />Yes there are flat, stereotypical characters.  But there is also much wonderful social commentary, particularly on justice and theology, that can stand up to comparison with Jonathan Swift.<br />This one gets permanent shelf space in my library.	2001-06-25

But I was confused by either my blindness to satire or the author's ignorance of social behavior at protestant churches. The plot centers around a church  that is the main religious center of the small town.  Somehow they manage  to financially support an extravegant life-style for at least two full time  ministers.  An after-funeral church dinner is called a pot-luck but it  features salad, baked chicken, lasagna bread-rolls, all prepared by a crew  in the church kitchen.  The dog Claudius seems to be the classiest person  in the book.	2000-05-18

And Follett managed to make me actually like the guy.  The plot is believable when you take into account the great skills of the FBI  managing the Chineese atomic spy case current now, or the grand manner in  which they investigated the Branch Davidians in Texas.<br />The complaints in  the other reviews can be summarized as &quot;this one is different, not  historical, not England.&quot;  It is contemporary California and that is  not all bad.

The victory in Japan and Germany was still fresh in the minds of every adult.  Then a small country few in America had even heard of almost shoved the heroic GI Joe  into the sea.  When the conflict reached a paper settlement, there were  some American prisoners who said they liked life as a foreigner in North  Korea better than the good old USofA.  The popular media and government  officials took a good look at those N. Korean prisoner of war camps, and  there was another shocking discovery:  NOT ONE American GI had escaped!   This had never happened before. (The source of the title.)<br />This book  reviews the circumstances and causes of this unique military event.  One of  the results was a careful training program at all levels on the  responsibility of a soldier who is captured by the enemy.  The result was  called the &quot;Code Of Conduct&quot; and every military individual knew  they had the responsibility to resist the enemy at all times and in all  ways, even as a prisoner.<br />Now that lesson has been forgotten.  The  American soldiers on patrol captured in Kosovo were taken and disarmed by  the Bosnian forces with no resistance.  The lessons of &quot;Every War But  One&quot; are now ignored as too idealistic.  That the strict standard of  the Code of Coduct kept mind and body together for many a GI prisoner in  Viet Nam is of no weight in today's all volunteer Army where casualties are  unthinkable and combat training is Aerobic Dancing. <br />Those who ignore the  lessons of history. . . .	1999-09-27

Eisenman cuts  the reader no slack.<br />This volume should be read with the understanding  that any commentary on the Dead-Sea Scrolls published more than perhaps 5  years ago was warped into meaninglessness by the pious orthodoxy of the  guardians of those scrolls.  Any reader of the King James version of the  New Testement must acknowledge that James was the brother of Jesus and the  designated leader of the church after Jesus departed the scene.  Orthodoxy  has never explained how the theology of Paul came to dominate the Christian  tradition and the little letter of James is taken with such a large grain  of salt.  Eisenman is a giant step in that direction and deserves a  respectful counter-argument from the orthodox tradition<br />John P. Meier's 2  vol work &quot;A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus&quot; is a  good supplement to Eisenman.  Meier has more extensive footnotes with good  expanding remarks on Josephus where Eisenman only cites his sources.   Eisenman makes good use of &quot;the normal canons of historical argument  and literary analysis&quot; particulary as they have developed in redaction  criticism of the bible.  The reader need not have a degree in bible studies  to slog through this difficult intellectual swamp.  But the reader will  drown if they depend on a traditional Christian fundamentalist life jacket  to keep their faith afloat while making this journey.	1999-09-15

I go to it when ever I find myself at some kind of personal impasse, depressed, or stymied any kind of activity in life.

I put down the book and  do it.<br />My own religious background is evangelical Christian.  This book  has a strong Hindu background and the fatalism of the Hindu religion  usually repells me.  But this book is different. The first and third  sections are good basic guides on what an honest &quot;good&quot; person  owes themself and society, and how to work off this debt in an efficient  manner.  When I first read it, I was struck by the obviousness of the  observation that if you want to play good tennis, you go out and seek to  play with tennis players who are better than you; if you want to improve  your spiritual life, hang out with spiritually better people.<br />And cook  books are useless if you never get out in the kitchen and cook.	1999-03-02

During the past 30 years as an adult, I have lived with 5 dogs: 4 were family pets, 3 serious hunting dogs, 2 very good hunting dogs and 2 very good family pets (oddly  enuff, the same 2!)  The dogs have varied in size from 25 to 90 pounds and  all had very individual personalities.<br />I have a bias toward books.  I  believe I can take care of any problem, do anything, if I just lay my hands  on the right book.  So I have read and owned many dog training books.  For  sound advice on family dogs, I have come to rely on Job Michael Evans.  He  was the anonomous writer for the Monks of New Skete and eventually became a  professional dog trainer, specializing in problem pets.  His stuff  works.<br />Then I found the book at hand: DogSmart by Myrna Milani.  This one  volume sums up the theory behind the detailed advice from Evans.  By basic  in the headline above, I do not mean dumbed down or insultingly elementary.  In understandable language you are given the information you need to  understand how to prevent confusion and problems developing between you,  the neighbors and your dog.  If you have the theory and principles, you can  invent your own solutions for your unique situation.<br />This should be every  prospective dog owner's first and most fundamental dog book.<br />And  interestingly, Milani dedicates this book to William E. Campbell, and the  late Job Michael Evans.	1999-02-02

The book was originally a typical scholarly paper published in a Peer-reviewed journal.  It was  ignored until the politically connected Cato Institute invited the author  to speak.  Then suddenly many jumped in to &quot;refute&quot; it without  checking his data.<br />The Kirkus Review above is typical of this:  &quot;In  Lott's mind. . . . Lott ignores common sense programs.&quot;  The  conclusion that more legally carried guns leads to less crime, that common  sense programs like gun buy-backs don't reduce gun crimes, are driven by  the data, not the desires of the author.<br />Lott's argument is based on hard  data. The raw data he has made available to scholars who have asked. (A new  scholarly curtesy made practical by computers and mini-discs.)  None have  refuted his interpretation of the data. Or declared the data  inadequate.<br />But this issue is political and scientific data will continue  to be ignored.	1999-01-25
