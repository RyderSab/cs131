US	52464042	R36YLTW03FAACF	0525945288	62524722	Lethal Measures	Books	1	1	2	N	N	#5 in this poor series	This 2000 book follows the typical &quot;action&quot; book where an evil greedy doctor causes havoc until he's caught, with far-right religious fanatics thrown in for laughs.<BR>In this story, after a large bomb explosion in Los Angeles leaves sixteen dead and twenty-eight injured, the FBI demands that all the injured be treated at our heroine's hospital, Memorial Hospital, AND that the incredibly brilliant, beautiful and desirable Joanna perform all the autopsies herself -- autopsies which largely involve examining small body parts.<BR>Of course, as always, Joanna is perfection itself: her supervisor can't &quot;believe someone so young and pretty could have that much brains.&quot; And her sometimes-boyfriend Jake?  Goldberg says, twice in ten pages, &quot;Jake was so damn good-looking.&quot; <BR>In contrast, Murdock, the supervisor with whom Joanna frequently squabbles, &quot;was aging so rapidly. His hair was now snow white, his face heavily lined and dotted with prominent age spots.&quot; Goldberg's message? In-group folks are Beautiful, while not-in-the-cool-group people age prematurely. Yet Goldberg frequently reports Joanna and Jake smoking. What's so attractive about that?<BR>Affected by being in the same city with Jake, Joanna turns to making Neanderthal threats: when the Boxing Commission won't turn over confidential records, Joanna threatens to confiscate all their files and issue a subpoena forcing the entire Boxing Commission to help search the files. To convince a rehab clinic to hand over its confidential records, Jake and Joanna threaten to &quot;red-tape every office and door in this building and put a cop by each of them to make sure no chart or record leaves.... And it will stay that way -- until some judge sorts everything out for us.&quot; Jake tells a man's new widow, &quot;if you're lying to me, you're going to need an attorney. A real good one.&quot;<BR>Bloopers and fractured history abound in this book.<BR>Triangulation of cell phone calls is NOT done &quot;by plotting the lines of transmissions as they bounced off the satellite orbiting high above the earth.&quot; Cell phones do NOT directly transmit to, or receive from, satellites. Goldberg continues, &quot;That was how they located O.J. Simpson in his Bronco on the freeway.&quot; Sorry, wrong again! What really happened in the O.J. case is that another driver recognized A.C. Cowlings as the Bronco passed, and phoned O.J.'s location to the police.  <BR>Goldberg claims that an AK-47 can &quot;fire a hundred rounds in seconds.&quot; While the top rate of fire of an AK-47 is six hundred rounds per minute, the rifle never fires a hundred rounds in seconds because its magazine size is thirty or forty rounds, and the barrel overheats quickly. Goldberg carries this lack of understanding into his rant against so-called Saturday night specials and &quot;assault weapons.&quot; (Later, in Deadly Harvest, Goldberg confuses a .223 caliber bullet with a .50 caliber bullet.)<BR>Goldberg claims that Idaho vital statistics records are only kept in the county courthouse. As in most or all states, copies of Idaho vital statistics are kept in the state capital.<BR>Goldberg has the President's fictional secret service agent, Jack Youngblood, constantly worry about a replay of the Kennedy assassination, without mentioning whether Goldberg's &quot;Jack Youngblood&quot; is related to the real-life Rufus Youngblood, LBJ's secret service agent during the JFK assassination, and later deputy director of the agency. It is historically unclear whether JFK ordered agents off the rear bumper, and whether agents in that location could have prevented or lessened harm to JFK.<BR>What's the ending? Oh yes, Joanna escapes a perilous situation, with Jake's help, and saves the day. Surprised? I think not. The only real decision Joanna faces in this book is which man to date. And Jake is faced with no challenges but to do his job, threaten those who cross him, and pursue the goddess Joanna.<BR>This book is not recommended, unless you're competing in the &quot;See How Many Mistakes YOU Can Find&quot; contest, or thoroughly enjoy one-dimensional wooden characters.	2003-12-08

Even the line spacing has been spread out -- only 34 text lines per page.<BR>As previous reviews note, the book is overwhelmed by e-mails being quoted verbatim, often at length.  There are *OVER 110* e-mails dropped into the narrative in this book!!  The authors should have used the e-mails as a wonderful reference for dates, events, and as a reminder to the authors of what Dr. Nielsen's and others' thoughts were at each point in time, as they crafted their narrative, instead of dumping the e-mails verbatim en masse in the readers' laps.  Instead of reading an e-mail from Nielsen to her parents about why she &quot;loves the ice,&quot; why does Nielsen not tell us herself -- or AT LEAST put in narrative why explaining herself to her parents was important?  Apparently it's easier and quicker to insert a lengthy e-mail than to write about the facts and feelings from a personal perspective.<BR>Previous reviews are accurate that a lot of the book is told from a girlish everyone-and-everything (except my ex-husband) is oh-so-wonderful viewpoint.<BR>There's interesting information about how the US South Pole station is set up, but often a lack of analysis or reflection.  She spends a paragraph on urine disposal, but then is silent (for the sake of 'sparing us the details') on how solid human waste was collected.  There were four different bathrooms in the dome;  why were they ALL coed, and remain so, when as Nielsen notes, &quot;It took quite a long time for me to get used to sitting on the toilet while watching a man in the urinal beside me&quot; ??  Wasn't it Nielsen, herself (as liner notes claim), who was &quot;solely responsible for the mental ... fitness&quot; of the Pole residents?<BR>There are a number of insights in the book, though;  it's not all dark for 180 days.  They can write movingly about the beauty and stark isolation of the Pole, the closeness of friends, and little events like exploring the original (ice-buried) Pole camp.  Nielsen's initial thoughts on realizing she was in an abusive marriage are well-done.  Yet, you have to plow through the e-mails to find Nielsen explaining to her mom that the Polies &quot;came to see how much we could count on ourselves....  We have found and conquered demons, thoughts, weaknesses....  Here, you can let go of these thoughts, and embrace the newly discovered strengths that only this place can illuminate.&quot;  Why &quot;ONLY this place,&quot; instead of ANY place of isolation and reflection?<BR>Earlier, Nielsen included an e-mail from her mom warning, &quot;I don't want you to come home sorry for cutting all ties to this world only to find that ... the Ice was a temporary experience....  People and things look different once one is away from such a close group.  The dynamics are similar to being in an army unit or a cult compound.&quot;  Nielsen, characteristically, has no comment about her mom's e-mail observations.<BR>The book also comes across as a bit too self-centered.  The title itself (not the liner notes!!) describes the book as &quot;A Doctor's Incredible Battle for Survival.&quot;  The complete story, I submit, would focus on the &quot;battle&quot; of fellow Pole residents who dedicated themselves to administering her treatments, and those who coordinated her treatment from outside, not to mention those who performed the risky winter supply drop and later early pick-up from the Pole.<BR>The narrative, except for the 100+ e-mail intrusions, and repeated reminders of how terrible her ex-husband is, is readable.  Yet it is missing something.  Nielsen tells you what the temperature is, and describes frost-bite.  A very well-written book, like _Into Thin Air_ by Jon Krakauer, makes you FEEL cold and oxygen-deprived.  In sum, you might pick this up from the library and read it (it's a fairly quick read);  it's not worth the purchase.	2001-09-10

The characters are multidimensional.  It's well-written and a page-turner -- exploring the unusual world of divided loyalties in a World War II German POW camp.<BR> That said, the book has some minor flaws.  The Germans would not be so concerned over the death of an American in a POW camp:  in real life, Americans could be summarily shot for violations such as looking out of a window at the wrong time.  One of the German guard characters is a bit too much like Sergeant Shultz.  Throwing bread over the fence is likewise unrealistic.  And an air combat kill is scored when an enemy _plane_ is downed, whether or not the pilot is killed.	2000-10-01

The submarine missile attachment itself is plausible enough -- it's the other stuff that's disappointing -- such as the constant repetition of how the  admiral (alone) is deciphering these obscure clues to figure out what is  going on, US officers _constantly_ referring to Arabs as  &quot;towelheads,&quot; and what each person is eating and what wine is  being served -- yet US intelligence almost ignores the sat photos of the  Iranian sub base, and makes a major military decision based on the  unconfirmed word of a known terrorist.  There are other bloopers such as  the discussion of whether a civilian might get a Congressional Medal of  Honor &quot;for marksmanship&quot; -- not to mention the idea that the  press gives up on any realistic investigation of the missing planes, and  Congress holds no hearings.  Nor is the author troubled to have the US  President consider launching a cruise missile attack to cause a major  flooding and starvation in another country, thinking that the attack could  (and should) be denied -- or to consider putting an international terrorist  on the US payroll, while giving him free reign in the US.<BR> The only  redeeming feature is that it provides some portrayal (however unrealistic  at the end) of the terrorist mind.<BR> The only question presented by the  eight or so glowing five-star reviews dated March 16th through April 5th is  whether they were written by the author, or his immediate family.	2000-04-16

Author Mandelbaum has done a lot of research, and presents use of the paranormal by the military in ages past well, with some good discussion of  the ethics of using psi, the validity of psi and remote viewing, and some  useful comments on how the implications of remote viewing affect our world  view.  But in my opinion the drawbacks of this book severely limit it.<br />  For instance, Mandelbaum lists as &quot;not fact&quot; the story by David  Morehouse that Morehouse's army helmet was hit by a machinegun round.  Why  is it not fact?  Because one scientist says that head trauma can't awaken  psychic experience.  And because McMoneagle had a Near Death Experience  (awakening McMoneagle's psychic ability), that means Morehouse couldn't  have very separately suffered head trauma.  Not only are there a number of  people who report that head trauma awakened their psychic talent, but one  could also find a number of scientists who would say McMoneagle's NDE  couldn't have any relationship to psychic ability.  Why the double  standard?  Does Mandelbaum really confuse McMoneagle's NDE (without head  trauma) with Morehouse's head trauma (without NDE)?  How illogical to claim  that one man's NDE disproves another man's head injury!  Morehouse was  actually struck by a bullet;  by including such pointless attacks,  Mandelbaum makes us wonder what other stuff Mandelbaum made up.<br />  Mandelbaum also criticizes Morehouse because Morehouse couldn't remote-view  the location of a stolen manuscript.  Yet McMoneagle, in McMoneagle's own  book, says that &quot;Remote viewing is _not_ good for locating [lost]  things&quot; (emphasis in original).  There's little dispute McMoneagle is  the best;  yet Mandelbaum criticizes Morehouse for not doing something  McMoneagle says can't be done.<br /> Mandelbaum's chapter 24 contains  repeated sophomoric insults to Ronald and Nancy Reagan.  What does that  have to do with the book topic?  Where was the editor?<br /> Some editing  out of personal animosity and illogic, and the removal of cutesy and  sophomoric comments, would greatly improve this book.  For the person  interested in remote viewing, I'd recommend, instead, Jim Schnabel's  _Remote Viewers_ and Joseph McMoneagle's _Mind Trek_.book topic?

He provides abundant examples (everyday and historical),  hypotheticals, and even a test where we can score how we tend to respond to  adversity, and improve our response.<br /> He lists 22 helpful ways to  _destroy_ the adversity of those around us (#4 -- Model victimhood.  Act  depressed -- it's contagious;  #9 -- Frame success as a freak accident;  #19 -- Uproot enthusiasm before it can grow).<br /> Problems with the book?  Sure there are.  It's a bit padded, especially in the beginning.  Much of  the book deals with overcoming adversity in business situations.  He also  criticizes those who decide to &quot;camp&quot; on the hillside instead of  always &quot;climbing&quot; to the top of the mountain.  I feel we can have  success and happiness, not to mention a family life, by  &quot;camping,&quot; just as I suspect &quot;climber&quot; is another word  for &quot;workaholic.&quot;<br /> In all, it's a very worthwhile book.	2000-03-23

The author, a B-1 pilot, was part  of the 1995 non-stop around-the-world flight of two B-1 bombers.  But it's  either untrue, or incredibly foolhardy, that &quot;he flew nonstop&quot;  for over 36 hours.  Surely his copilot alternated with him.  <BR><br />Also  untrue is that &quot;he was presented the MacKay Trophy for the 'most  significant aerial achievement of the decade.'&quot;  The MacKay trophy  that year, according to the Air Force, was for the &quot;most meritorious  flight of the year,&quot; and was presented to all eight men who flew  aboard the two B-1's around the world, not just to author Stewart.

US	52464042	RZ96J2BAVQKQX	0671568000	609041298	A G-Man's Journal	Books	3	17	17	N	N	Interesting read, a bit cluttered	Revell, in this co-authored book, believes in the philosophy &quot;never say in 350 pages what you can say in 570.&quot;<BR> The events are apparently purely chronological, and almost stream-of-consciousness.   There's a lot of jumping from subject to subject, with little transition or  unifying theme.  While the book has a bibliography and index, it's lacking  a glossary, which would be helpful for those of us who don't use acronyms  like OSG, JSOC, CSG, and CISPES on a daily basis.<BR> The book would be  less cluttered if there wasn't a compulsion to include every incident in  which Revell wished to claim credit, or rebut an allegation of misconduct  against him.  For instance, the liner notes claim that Revell  &quot;participated in ... the JFK assassination [investigation].&quot;  It  turns out Revell wasn't even in the FBI at the time;  he was a Marine who  was liaison to FBI agents who were interviewing Marines who had known  Oswald during Oswald's  Marine service.<BR> It is an interesting account of  agent Revell's career, and FBI history and lore, mainly from within the FBI  bureaucracy looking down, and contains some almost-hidden nuggets of  insight on personalities and events you probably won't find elsewhere.<BR>  Read _No Heroes_ by Danny O. Coulson for a street agent perspective on many  of the same events.	1999-11-28
US	52464042	R10YHXVSUY8RAR	0451190157	159875656	The Legacy	Books	3	0	5	N	N	Standard page-turner	This standard page-turner, as previous reviews note, asks readers to accept more and more improbable conspiracies and plot twists.<br /> The ending let-down is the huge blooper at the end when author Frey terms as  &quot;financial genius&quot; the father's plan to give the $15 million tape  to his son while alive, thus &quot;avoiding inheritance tax.&quot;  This  author, specializing in financial settings, should know that gifts which  exceed the lifetime gift/estate tax exclusion of about $650,000 are subject  to the same tax as an inheritance.  Giving a $15 million item during life  has virtually the same estate/gift tax consequence as leaving the item to  your heirs after death.<br /> In fact, it would be financial stupidity for  the father to give such a valuable item to his son during life;  the father  would pay a huge gift tax, _and_ the son would pay income tax upon selling  the item.  If the father left the item upon death, only one tax would be  paid due to the &quot;stepped up basis&quot; the son would receive.<br />  Frey manages to reverse the actual tax benefit;  hopefully no one reads the  book and decides to &quot;save inheritance tax&quot; by making large gifts  during life.  Best-selling authors should do better research.	1999-11-18
US	52464042	RKH8HJ4QJ9OKX	0688155898	475605400	Life in Prison	Books	4	3	8	N	Y	Great book for the purpose	It's a great book for the purpose -- kind of a &quot;scared straight&quot;  book, written by a life-term inmate with the street credibility of a  co-founder of the Crips.<BR>  There's no insight about how Williams came to  be &quot;found guilty of killing four people in two robberies&quot; --  maybe that would mess up potential appeals.  Nor is there much insight  about the gang life outside prison.<BR> The book could benefit from  mentioning the effects of a shorter term in prison, such as for robbery or  drugs.  The vast majority of inmates aren't in for life, but for shorter  terms.  By concentrating on how hard a life sentence is, does that leave an  implication shorter terms are &quot;not that bad&quot;?  Why not some  discussion of how a felony conviction can cramp one's style for life, even  for someone who is used to living on the edges of society?	1999-11-15

Did the author want us to believe he  gathered all this material first-hand?<BR> The author (a military pilot in  the 1940's and current private pilot) doesn't explain why, on the last  page, he talks about the &quot;infinitesimal number of fatalities  considering the vast number of passengers,&quot; yet in the dedication of  the book to his wife, he reveals that on family trips around the world, he  and his wife _never_ (his emphasis) flew on the same plane until their son  reached 21.  If (as they are) the chances of a crash are  &quot;infinitesimal,&quot; why did his family go to such outrageous steps  on the assumption there was a decent chance one of their planes would  crash?	1999-11-04
US	52464042	R37FPS2UK0QZ4	0812924150	270875829	Behind the Crystal Ball:: Magic, Science and the Occult from Antiquity Through the New Age	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Worthwhile book on subject	I was surprised this 1996 book is already out of print!<BR> The book examines different ways that man through history has been attracted to  &quot;magic,&quot; seemingly defined as &quot;that which does not bear up  under the Western scientific method.&quot;<BR> The individual chapters on  types of &quot;magic&quot; in history, such as alchemy and mesmerism, are  interesting, although episodic.  They sometimes suffer from an  over-abundance of fine detail and too much direct quotation of primary and  secondary sources, in what is essentially a chapter review of certain  practices.<BR> The author shines best in his chapters labeled  &quot;summaries,&quot; and in the final four chapters and epilogue where he  attempts to bring it all together.  He suggests that no one theory or world  view explains all observations, and that perhaps multiple realities exist  simultaneously.<BR> &quot;'There is no system of truth with which to  account for all aspects of being.'  ... [B]oth science and magic ... have  definite tools and methods, separate technologies, contrastable rational  procedures, and systematic bodies of knowledge....<BR> &quot;When we cast  modern scientific spells upon the world in order to control it we too are  engaging in a form of religious ritual, albeit one that depends more upon  the worship of the book and the computer than on eliciting the power of the  spoken word.  Incidentally, this religion too has its fanatics....<BR>  &quot;Are there multiple realities, other subuniverses of the mind that lie  beneath the concrete, sensible world in which we place all our faith? ...   Perhaps the thought planes that we perceive are all there at the same time  and we spend our days and nights switching channels from one to the other.   Some of us give better Nielsens to the magic channel than to the reason  channel because we enjoy its programs more.&quot;<BR> While the author is  generally understanding of the need to do &quot;magic,&quot; he strangely  distancesmagic from orthodox religion, although his book-opening quote is  &quot;one man's religion is another man's superstition.&quot;  An  examination of how Western man tries to reconcile scientific method with  orthodox religious beliefs, which, even if &quot;real,&quot; entail belief  in unseen beings and a history that is largely not provable, together with  a belief that unseen beings assist or hinder us in our daily lives, would  have been beneficial in comparison to the unseen beings and cosmological  history that Westerners see as untrue.	1999-10-27
US	52464042	R17EJDP0SFU8DS	081171814X	448767799	Unsinkable: The Full Story of RMS Titanic	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Good read, especially in social context, could be better	This replay of the Titanic story is best as it places the tragedy in the context of the social setting:  &quot;the men and women aboard the Titanic demonstrated almost every derogatory characteristic of Edwardian society:   arrogance, pride, snobbery, prejudice, racism, chavinsim, and maudlin  sentimentality.  They also showed in equal measure the Edwardians' capacity  for self-confidence, self-reliance, self-sacrifice, gallantry, noblesse  oblige, and devotion to duty.&quot;  The book also presents an interesting  view on how the sinking affected the psyche of the age.<BR> The book is  also better than most at pointing out the precise physical reasons that  most 3rd class passengers did not reach the lifeboats.  It also goes into  depth on the &quot;women and children first&quot; issue -- and even how  that affected the women's suffrage movement.  Overall, the tone of the book  seems &quot;balanced&quot; -- while the author isn't afraid to assign  blame, he seems to present the arguments pro and con.<BR> The book  surprisingly doesn't point out important facts.  For instance, the Titanic  had specially strengthened lifeboat davits that enabled lifeboats to be  lowered while full.  But no one bothered to tell, or train, the officers  and men that the new davits allowed the boats to be lowered full -- THAT is  the reason many boats were lowered half-empty, and hundreds died  needlessly.<BR> As a minor annoyance, the author uses inconsistent or  confusing measurements.  The Carpathia was 58 miles away at the time of the  SOS (CQD), and sailed to the scene at 17 knots.  Was that 58 statute or  nautical miles?  For the benefit of most of us, the author could have both  specified whether he used nautical or statute mileage distance  measurements, and also pointed out that 1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour =  1.15 statute miles per hour.	1999-10-14

We learn that he learned a lot, likes to criticize nurses, and apparently made no  mistakes in his intern year.<BR> Strangely, the book comes alive in the  20-page epilogue, in which the author narrates his pre-med school work in  the remote areas of Papua New Guinea studying kuru.  The author opens up  his feelings and experiences with a fascinating story of the contrast  between the cultures and medical practices, and kuru itself.  If you come  across this book, skip the first 222 pages and read the epilogue....	1999-06-30
US	52464042	RFYUZGNJ3K22Q	0060175818	66914180	The First Eagle (A Leaphorn and Chee Novel)	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Coasting	From most authors, this would be an impressive book. From Hillerman, it  is not. He's coasting with this one -- worth reading, but don't buy it.  I checked mine out of the library.<BR> Yes, it has Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn,  and it's set on the reservation.  But the precipitating conflict is between  two non-Native American  researchers on the reservation. Leaphorn gets  hired by one of the  researcher's parents to solve her disappearance.  Glimpses of Navajo  culture and thinking, and Hopi culture, are here. But  they are only glimpses, of what  was fully laid out in exquisite and  compassionate detail in Hillerman's previous books. <BR> As other reviewers  note, this appears to be a &quot;rush&quot; book. I finished it in  less  than 24 hours after I picked it up. The hardback edition is 278  pages  long, _but_ there are 31 lines per page, instead of the typical  40+ lines  per page most hardbacks have. If you've heard great things  about  Hillerman, they're true -- but NOT in this book. Please start with  one of  his others.	1999-04-20

While the author points out the pervasive criminal acts of  organized crime, it's hard to escape the feeling that (as John Gotti),  there are attractions to the &quot;business&quot; of organized crime.  <BR>The author quotes one person as saying, &quot;As a wiseguy, you can  lie, you can cheat, you can steal, you can kill people -- _legitimately_.   You can do any ______ thing you want, and nobody can say anything about it.   Who wouldn't want to be a wiseguy?&quot;	1998-11-09
