Unfortunately my introduction to it was tutoring for an introductory class.  The material is well written and organized but far too densely written, particularly for students who have never had a logic class before and are coming from questionable mathematics backgrounds.   That there is no index of symbols just makes navigating the text that much more difficult.<br />On another level, the author seems to eschew a good many things that many other logic courses--at least those I've seen and taken--use in depth.  Things like Modus Ponens are barely touched on in favor of &quot;v E&quot; (disjunction elimination).  This seems unusual for an introductory textbook in the field, though I am not familiar enough to know for certain.	2003-10-17

It covers basic concepts, rules, and a little bit about how to think in the game.  It is fun to read, fast moving, and doesn't have the translation difficulties so many other texts in this field seem to have.<br />That having been said, most of the information here is so basic that if you know how to play, you could comfortably skip this book and head on to the next one.<br />If you want to get into go, but have no idea of what the basics are for this game, then this is the book for you.  If you have an idea of how to play, then it is time for The Way of the Moving Horse (Book two in this series).	2003-02-24

Concepts are presented well and, unlike many other books on Stochastic Modeling, sigma algebra is avoided (this is a definant plus for making it into an undergrad or low-level grad textbook).<br />That having been said, this book has some of the worst organization I have ever seen in a textbook.  Every chapter is divided into sections and at the end of each section there are questions which are separated into &quot;Exercises&quot; and &quot;Problems&quot;; this in-and-of itself is not as much of a problem as that everything is numbered the same way.<br />Therefore problem 5 in section 4 chapter 3 is numbered the same way (4.5) as exercise 5 in the same section and chapter is numbered the same way as exercise/problem 5 in the same section of any other chapter in the book.  The only real difference between &quot;Exercises&quot; and &quot;Problems&quot; is that exercises tend to be answered in the back of the book.<br />There are also other organizational difficulties in the text itself--such as that it is never entirely clear where the examples are in the text: there are several things which are labeled as examples (and are), however, over half of the examples in some chapters seem to be simply thrown into the text without any special indicator that they are examples of what is being discussed.<br />While the content in this book is good, the organization is so wretched that I have to knock it down two stars.	2003-02-20

I picked up this book as an impulse buy thinking that it might make for a quick, fun read and that there might be some depth or a witty critique of modern society in it.<br />I found that it lacked everything except being a quick, fun read.<br />The changes in characters and the  constant time shifts in the plot when moving between the characters quickly shattered the strength of the story, Barry's message, or the world he set it in.  This causes a jarring effect and, while following the plot isn't difficult, it loses a lot of power that the story would otherwise have had.<br />Characters in this novel are almost universally flat, lacking any kind of depth or sustenance to speak of, and you never get a feel for them or a sense of their reality.  This also causes problems in that his choice of language at several points is jarring with respect to the reader.<br />That being said, it was a light, fun read that--while it didn't make one introspective in the slightest--was certainly worth taking a little time to get through.	2003-02-12

Sufficit to say that, for a book first published in 1912, it has proven to be an absolutely wonderful resource that has linked several estringent elements in my mind and brought them into focus.<br />Reading through it, worlds seemed to open before me and a path was made clear where before it was obscured by the superstitions and the window dressings that have been added to so many religions over the years in an attempt at what this book so eloquently describes.	2002-02-27

Basic guides that have very little fluff and are as down to earth as possible on the topic at hand--in this case what my coven fondly refers to as &quot;critters.&quot;  It is a decent book, though not increadibly in depth, and discusses such fundamentals as differential diagnosis (telling the differance between these phenomena and more &quot;mundane&quot; explanations), protection, and a Western Esoteric view on them.<br />Greer assumes, though it is not stated explicitly, a basic understanding of magic, rituals, and the planes of existance.  He provides something of a &quot;refresher course&quot; throughout the material for those who do not have a strong background in these fields, but I would hate to have to teach myself completely from it.<br />Those without some background in some form of Western Magic will not get as much out of this book as they could otherwise: some of the techniques of banishing and diagnosis require familiarity with said practices and the terminology--though fairly well explained--is used throughout the book. <br />As I stated before, the information presented here is very basic and not meant to be overly complex.  This is not an experts field guide so much as it is a beginners introduction to the subject with a handful of more advanced referances for the curious.  Definantly recommended overall--particularly for those who are just getting used to the idea that there might be &quot;critters&quot;.	2002-02-26
US	52432319	RCZUUVD7SZMQ	0786926457	871727540	Sea of Swords	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Decent, not outstanding	This was a decent read if you have enjoyed the other books in Salvatore's series.  It had a good amount of action, subtelty, and some political intrigue thrown in for flavour.  It was also nice, on several levels, for him to visit some old story lines and tie up loose ends.<BR> <br />That being said:<BR>Salvatore seems to work best with characters currently in development: Drizzt while overcoming his past and the scars that he carried because of it, Cadderly through his trials and tribulations, more recently Artemis's character along with Jarlaxle, &c.<br />In this book he makes a critical error: he revisits many characters who's development is essentially over.  Complete characters who are ready to be shelved and brought out as occasional NPCs, not to be put into the spotlight unless something critical is going on.  He has taken steps to further their development, but he has failed to provide anything truly refreshing with these characters that will move them forward and make them interesting--in the Salvatorian style--to continue reading about.<br />Essentially the \\"Companions of the Hall\\" are a \\"Veni. Vici. Vinci.\\" group.  They have no weaknesses, few internal demons, none of them can ever die, and they can overcome anything together.<br />Further, Salvatore is showing a lack of willingness to kill a main character when it is appropriate to do so: a heroic death that will be sung by bards around the world for ages to come.  Salvatore sets it up perfectly and then has an almost unbelievable circumstance save the character.  A few times (Gandalf comming back, Bruenor's return) I'm more than willing to accept, but it keeps getting more and more unbelievable.<br />I did enjoy this book and recommend it to anyone who has read the series leading up to this book (particularly if it is fresh in your mind), but Salvatore's style needs to evolve to fit the characters that he is trying to portray.	2002-02-13

It gives a nice, broad overview of some basic topics, problems for the student to solve, and is generic as far as programming languages are concerned.<br />That being said, for my use this book was not detailed enough and failed to go into sufficient detail into many different areas (such as the eigenproblem).  It is definantly an undergrad text and would be an excellent choice for a 300-level math or computer science class, it also provides a good general background in numerical computing.  In that regard this book is a fine choice.	2002-02-12
US	52432319	R265RO2ROMV5PN	013834194X	418738122	Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis	Books	5	53	55	N	N	A Students Review	First: I must prefix this by saying that I am majoring in the Mathematical and Computer Sciences.<br />This semester I decided to take a class that happened to use this text as its source.  I have been extremely pleased with it: the theoretical work is excellent, the proofs are thourough, the exercises are both good and cover a broad variety of difficulties, and the tables on the CD provide excellent experience in analyzing real world data.<br />A couple of things to keep in mind before you purchase this book, however:<br />1) A good background in linear algebra and  basic statistics is highly recommended and virtually necessary to interpret this book.  Remembering the knowledge gleaned from &quot;Sequences and Series&quot; (often taught in Calculus II) will also prove useful.  The text is good, but it is often nontrivial.<br />2) Some kind of software that does multivariate analysis (and if nothing else, will find eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors) is necessary to get the most out of this book.  The software package SAS is touched on in the book, but by no means is given a comprehensive review. However, the data files on the CD-ROM should be loadable by any competant software package, so use the one you are most comfortable with.<br />If not overly familiar with any of them, I can recommend S, SPlus, and &quot;GNU's S&quot; (also known as &quot;R&quot;) for their power and flexability to work with the data presented in the book.<br />All and all I found this to be an excellent book, definantly worthwhile if you want or need to know how to do multivariate analysis.	2002-02-06

The way it is written seems like three things were taking place: 1) they were not taking advantage of the language or using it's features; 2) they were trying to fit the code into as small a space as possible; 3) the authors were not that experienced in the language to begin with.<br />Thus arrays are counted from 1 instead of 0, the code uses variable names that are more than a little lacking (e.g., the array &quot;d&quot; returned the list of eigenvalues), and rather than pass by referance they pass a pointer.<br />Hence, if you are going to use this book, be prepared to translate the code so that it is both efficient and legible in your own text.  This is not difficult, just nominally time consuming and occasionally tedious.  Fix this and the book's utility would increase a hundredfold.<br />Overall I found this book to be worthwhile, despite its shortcommings, and have yet to find its equal anywhere in industry.	2002-02-05

This book is well organized, sorted by both size of the group (major or minor) and alphabetically, and covers a great many \\"evil baddies\\" in the world that can be easily incorperated into either a new game or an existing Campaign.<br />Groups like The Night Masks, The Church of Shar, The Church of Bane, the Shades, and the Drow are now covered in extensive detail.  A rich history is given, along with what are essentially roleplaying notes, and stats on prestige classes and promenant members of the organization.	2002-01-30

The issues arise in that the quality of the information is horrid.<br />The presentation of the information leaves a great deal to be desired: I often think that the authors are intentionally trying to be obtuse by their use of terminology that they don't define and by providing only a bare minimum of effort in their examples which are briefly skimmed over and not up to par with their questions at the end of each section.<br />It is impossible to teach yourself from this book without a good set of lecture notes to aid you.  There is very little information actually present and what is presented tends to be non-comprehensive in quality.  The author has a tendancy to skip over the mathematical foundation behind what is going on.<br />The mathematical foundations are, in fact, not really covered at all.<BR>The matlab sections are of similar quality: skimming over the examples and setting information without explaining the whys and the wherefores.<BR>I found that the questions at the end of the sections were good, but that is about the extent of it.	2001-09-26

It is well done--and the elements of Science Fiction and Fantasy both are still readily present--but the tone is similar to one of Stephen King's novels.  Be forewarned: there are aspects of this story that make Morrowindle (in Elf Queen of Shannara) look like Disney World.<br />That being said, this is an increadible masterpiece of fantasy (bordering Science Fiction in some parts) that is absolutely engrossing.  It catches you up in its story and carries you in its current.  I found it difficult to easily put down once I had been caught up in it and would have finished it earlier if it had not been for engineering classes.<br />As is true to Brooks's style, there are multiple stories running simultaneously that switch to other stories on cliffhangers.  This leads to the last sentance of every chapter bringing you up to the cliff and sending chills down your spine for what it reveals, which is mildly annoying since my eye developed a tendancy to jump and I had to cover up the last page till I was actually on it to savor the effect of the words.<br />An excellent book that I highly recommend, but if you couldn't stomach The Stand (by Stephen King) it probobly isn't for you.	2001-09-23

Supplements such as Tome of Blood and Sword and Fist had made me leary of the paperback supplements that were being released for Dungeons and Dragons.  After reading through the reviews here, I decided to purchase a copy.<br />The information presented was increadible.  This had many of those things I thought to be lacking from the FR Campaign Setting Sourcebook: spell charts including the new spells (as a bonus it also includes spell charts for the prestige classes in the DMG, such as the assassin), actual descriptions of mythals and how the ones in certain areas behaved, and a great deal of additional information (such as Mage Duels, Magical Roads, and a Mage Fair) that I can apply to virtually any campaign.<br />The book itself, despite being a softcover, is absolutely gorgeous and has been done in the same style as the FR Camapign Setting Sourcebook.  If it were hardcover, it would be perfect and well worth the price tag.  As it now stands, it is a wonderful supplement to games both inside and outside the realms.	2001-09-23

For once the rules make sense and are clearly laid out and easy to understand.  There is sufficient information for DM's to create campaigns in each of the planes without going overboard on detail.  The price is reasonable for the quality of the book and it is a truly beautiful piece.<br />There are a few issues I have with the book:<br />1) Organization is on the overall very decent, however, some things (like magic items) are spread chaotically when they come up.<br />2) A few of the concepts aren't as well explained as they could be.<br />3) Background information is relatively limited.<br />These, however, are all relatively minor and don't keep me from giving it my highest recommendation.	2001-09-18

It presents information on the theories behind Chaos Magic, good resources to followup on, and interesting information on different forms that magic can take.  The information is clear, well laid out, and well written so that it is an easy read.<br />That being said...<BR>At the beginning of the book it almost sounds like Hine is preaching rather than informing.  There is also a lack of an index in the book, making it a poor referance despite being an excellent straight through read and guide.<br />All in all I recommend this book highly despite its (few and far between) flaws.	2001-09-18

Some of it is really good information on Faery Wicca, but most of it is just Starhawk and her groups throughout the years.<br />I still recommend this book for its exercises and some of its content, but that I can only strongly recommend it for its exercises and lightly recommend it for some of its content keeps me from rating it more than 3 stars.	2001-09-13

There is an index of tables in the back of the book and the full index is clearly legiable as to what is in the DMG (rather than also cross-referancing to the PHB).<br />The information that is presented are the kinds of things that the DM needs but that the players not only shouldn't know, but really don't need: there are chapters on world building, rewards, magical items, and running campaigns in general.  Prestige classes are introduced in a clear and concise way, along with a few examples that are, for the most part, well thought out (personally I thought the Assassin needed work, but I digress).<br />The Challenge Rating table (the way experience is determined in D&amp;D 3) is clear and easy to follow, with simple rules for monsters that are not on the table.  Everything is clearly explained and easy to calculate.<br />Unlike AD&amp;D 2, where the only purpose of owning the DMG was the magical items section in the back, I have found--after 10 years experience--that this book still had things to teach me.<br />All in all, if you are running a campaign, this book is a virtual necessity.	2001-09-13

The statistical information, along with the feats are clear and easy to follow.  A full set of average stats are presented for all of the creatures and it is easy to break them down to enhance them with classes.<br />All in all worthwhile and even necessary if you are a Dungeon Master.<br />The presentation, however, could use a little work.  It is sometimes difficult to tell what pictures are associated with which monsters as the information just kind of flows through the book.<br />The role-playing aspects of what is mentioned is also significantly reduced.  There is very little information on the society or ecology of most of the creatures, nor on their allegiances/habbits (for instance, it is not mentioned that Beblith hunt Tanari).<br />While I understand the reasoning, it would have been an excellent addition and I would have gladly given it 5 stars.	2001-09-13

Everything  is also cleanly integrated into the D&amp;D 3 world, accounting for &quot;Power Resistance&quot; in some monsters.<br />The balance is decent but at least well thought out and Dungeon Masters shouldn't have any difficulty incorperating these rules into an already running campaign.<br />The price, for what you get, is maybe a touch high but not ridiculous.

This does not matter as much if you are less ceremonial, but to those who are either personally more ritualistic or who's coven is more ritualistic (both are true for me), it really does provide a good basis.<br />It also provides examples of each of the Sabbats and several other types of ceremonies, so if you have never run a Samhain ritual (for instance), it can be beneficial to look through one, along with the background information provided, before trying to write one that will be performed in front of the Coven.  Other sections include things like Protective Rituals, drawing down the sun, and other basics.<br />Think of it like a introductory engineering book: not as useful as a learning tool as a referance both for while you are learning and later in your career.	2001-09-13

Many of the Prestige Classes are out of whack, but that is a trend that Scarred Lands is just echoing from a great many of the D&amp;D 3 class sourcebooks.<br />Most of the magical items are overpowered and are not well explained as to function.<br />The section on Ritual Magic is good and provides a new set of options of characters, particularly at a low level, who would like to stack metamagic feats but lack spell levels to do so.  The rules are fair and balanced, but often-times are not clearly explained.<br />True Rituals are interesting, but difficult to incorperate for anyone other than  Dungeon Master as a plot-hook.<br />If you are a Dungeon Master looking for an interesting expansion to the magical rules, I can recommend this book just for its sections on ritual magic, even neglecting the spells (which aren't half bad).<br />For players, there really isn't a need.	2001-09-13

Rather than being a &quot;game of exceptions,&quot; 3rd Ed. is designed in such a way that if you don't know the rule, an intuitive guess generally comes close.  There is a minimum of table referencing that goes on during the game and the flow of combat tends to be very smooth.<br />The starting price is also excellent, allowing people to act as nothing but a player for much less than most other gaming systems.<br />I do have a few caveats about the implementation of 3rd Ed., such as its emphasis on minitures in combat, but these are minor and overall these books are truly worthwhile.	2001-09-12

It is a standard dungeon crawl, which isn't my normal style, and needed a few tweaks to make it workable.  Still, the amount of crafting I needed to do was far less than I initially expected.<br />A few issues:<br />1) The hooks (other than one of them) are fairly poor.  The one that is actually pretty good (rescuing heros) needs some additional background information, depending on how inquisitive your PCs normally are.<br />2) There is no explanation for how the Goblins are getting to the surface to sell the apples.  This isn't really a problem, just a small thing that doesn't make sense.<br />3) There are two points that connect to the Underdark, however, as a more free-form DM, I found a heavy dislike for just describing winding tunnels leading nowhere, no matter how far the PCs decide to travel (the recommended solution if they care to go trouncing down a ways).  My solution was to map out a small section of the Underdark and throw in a few ambiance encounters.<br />4) The DM has a great deal to keep track of: what is in what room and whether the PCs have been heard.  While this is true in most modules the number of small creatures makes it a little more interesting.  Not a problem, but some DMs might find this annoying.<br />5) Some encounters are set up strangely.  For instance, Twig Blights (one of the creatures described in the game) are encountered, as a rule, in groups of 3 or more.  Random encounters described in the book are invariably pairs, however.  This is easy to fix and the PCs are generally more than equipped to handle the extra twig blight, but it would have been nice if the author had been more consistant.<br />These are all relatively minor points: I still recommend this highly to both novice and experienced DMs who are looking for a good low-level module to play with.	2001-09-08
US	52432319	RDFNYTXK3CIEQ	0786918365	439626629	Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.0 Fantasy Roleplaying, Forgotten Realms Setting)	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Some Good, Some Bad	The content in this book is absolutely astounding, first rate,however, I as a Dungeon Master have more than a few caveats with the way that this book was designed:<br />1) It is poorly organized and tabbed.  There is no section, for instance, on NPCs (and to find one you have to tramp through an enormous Geography section), there is no map section where all of the maps are centrally referanced, and the tabs don't lead me to the nice little areas (like &quot;races&quot;) but rather things like &quot;Characters.&quot;  There is no &quot;Feats&quot; tab, but it is included in with the &quot;Characters&quot; section.<br />2) There is no level-based index of magical spells.<br />3) There is no glossery for terms like &quot;mythal,&quot; which someone who has read the fiction might understand but certainly not someone entering this cold.<br />4)How exactly some of the character class combinations occured in the NPCs is unclear.  For instance, Artemis Entreri is described as being Rog4/Rgr1/Ftr12/Asn1.<br />Even assuming that such a character took the Rgr1 level last, they would be unable to advance further under the standard D&amp;D3 rules.  No character would cripple their own advancement like that, so why should the (vast majority) of NPCs.  Another minor point on Artemis is that they describe his dagger as a +4 defending dagger: the problem with this should be immediately obvious.<br />5) The price tag is more than a little high for a book like this, even one that is this beautiful.	2001-08-01
US	52432319	R4DK6EABOTTZP	1565924487	56132163	UML in a Nutshell	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Wonderful Reference Manual	Personally, as someone who knows UML already and does a great deal with Tech Writing, this book is a wonderful reference guide.  It presents UML cleanly without the fluff I have seen in many other books of its type (hence its low cost and small size).<br />I would hate to try and learn UML from this book, but it isn't meant to be a teaching guide: it is meant to be a reference book.  It is not meant to be a book about software design, or about software engineering, or about project management: it is meant to be a reference book in UML and in that task it succeeds wonderfully.	2001-06-24

If you are looking for some lower level undead, this is a good book. That being said, I have some issues with it: the book would have been a much more reasonable if it had had 150% the number of monsters (~150) and been 75% of the price ($16.5, this would have meant about 11 cents per monster).<br />It has 1/5th the number of monsters that the MM has, is a fairly flimsy paperback, yet it is 110% of the price ($22 as opposed to $20). This is outrageous for the way the book is written and for only 100 monsters. At a price/monster ratio (ignoring that one is hard-cover), the MM is roughly 4.4 cents per monster while this is 22 cents per monster.<br />The initial price was reasonable, the price of the sourcebooks is approaching ridiculous. Overall the book is good, the content is decent and it is worthwhile for a Faerun campaign, but if you are looking for something truly outstanding, skip it.	2001-03-12

There are indeed parts that make you raise your eyebrow, however, most of  these can be overriden by an examination of timeperiod and environment that  Hughes has placed her main characters in.<br />A good piece of Sci Fi for  those who are interested in it in that age category.	2000-06-17

It definantly lives up to what have become my expectations for the masters Weis and Hickman.<br />On the other hand, it would no be a good introductory  work into the Dragonlance Series: I would not have found it nearly as  enjoyable if I had not read some of the other series before this one (the  only &quot;must read&quot; beforehand, however, is Chronicals  Trilogy).<br />All in all an excellent read, highly recommended.	2000-06-02

Though borrowing from Xanth in concept, it takes this concept to a new level and adds a serious overture (even the fop  character of Simkin plays into this).  Highly recommended.<br />DHC	2000-05-15
