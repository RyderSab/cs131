Books that give alternative views of the paranormal are few.  From a visit to a new age bookshelf one might get the impression that acceptance of new age ideas is universal.  (Probably this is because only believers are interested in reading about astrology, ESP, dream interpretations and all that).  But for those of us who like to be open-minded enough to examine the evidence a book like this is a welcome find.  Many people reject paranormal beliefs out of hand, but does this mean that an examination of the evidence will compel belief?  The short answer is \\"no\\".  This book explains why.  He shows that new age claims and been examined, and found to be inadequate.<br />     Some of the refutations of paranormal claims could have been more exhaustive, but most of us don't want that.  He brings enough evidence to the table to show it for what it is.  Some reviewers have claimed that the book is \\"one-sided\\".  As if the truth is always in the middle of any dispute.  (I suppose if there is a disupte as to if 2+2 is 4 or 5, decide on a compromise value of 4.5)<br />     What recommends this book over some others similiar to it is it's wide range of topics.  The author debunks polygraph machines, subliminal persuasion, and even pychoanalysis.  This last one seemed especially surprising to me given that the author is a teacher of psychology!  This is a good reference to have to debate with people who plead \\"just keep an open mind\\".  Here is the evidence, it doesn't help their cause one bit.  Ah, the waste of time and money a person can avoid by reading this book!  I endorse it enthusiastically.	2003-02-01

We the readers get to identify with Watson, who blunders and then is set straight by Holmes.  I think this way of presenting math makes it more fun.  Otherwise mathematical ideas run the risk of being too dry.<br />Some of the ideas explored in this book are: gambler's fallacy (a long run of bad luck does not make one due for good luck), sunk costs, (sunk costs are sunk costs, don't throw good money after bad).  If this sounds interesting to you, then you'd probably like it.	2001-04-06

But in many ways it is still fresh, and despite all the talk about &quot;new morality&quot;, the controversies in his day still  rage today.  (This is the book that got Lord Russell in so much trouble at  City College of New York)  What is unique about this book that it addresses  some of the dilemmas of domestic life.  Dilemmas that are real yet  apparently other writers don't have the courage to face.<br />This book  deserves to be in the library of every serious thinker.	2000-04-21

I'm fairly open-minded, and I thought Dr. Morey even makes a couple of good points.  But he also makes many bad points.  For example he  is always attacking particular atheists personally, instead of their  arguments.  Also he seems unaware at how circular his thinking is, he  points out how non-believers will not live according to scripture.  He  finds this significant, where I wonder, &quot;What else would you  expect?&quot;<br />My friend also suggested that write to Dr. Morey.  I did  send some of my questions to him, however, I never received a response.  If  you want to be entertained, I think it likely you may enjoy this book.   However, I'm sure that there must be better  defenses of the Christian  Faith.	2000-04-21

The science we so often learn in school makes it seem as though science always proceeds in a straight-forward manner.  This book explodes that stereotype.  I  particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Kelvin and his estimate of the age  of the earth, and, of course, the famous one between Galileo and the  Church.<br />The most recent one is between Derek Freeman and the late  Margaret Mead.  After I first read about it I felt that people were being  pretty hard on Mead, but since then I've changed my mind.  People claiming  to do scientific research are held to high standards.  If they are found to  be not completely honest, even once, their reputation is ruined.  That is a  high standard, but a fair one.	2000-04-05

But I would insist that they admit that is what they want to do.  What makes reading this book actually painful is that it is so manipulative, the  author pretends to teach economics when he really wants to preach  collectivism and even class envy.  A premise that is usually not addressed  in books such as this is the notion that we can divide up evenly all the  income in the nation and that somehow this would not affect productivity.   Then after ignoring this quite serious objection he points out that some  people have more than others (oh, really?).  The implication being that  this must certainly be &quot;unfair&quot;.<br />The author is entitled to  these opinions and attitudes, I wish that he wouldn't disguise them as  &quot;the science of economics&quot;.  To the reader who is curious about  economics I would suggest Henry Hazelett's &quot;Economics in One Easy  Lesson&quot;.  That book is very clear and readable.  And as to the  left-wing, right-wing controversy in economics, please, make up your OWN  mind, but take a couple hours and listen to what Hazelett had to say on the  subject.  And please ignore these rantings of a jealous man, consumed by  envy.	2000-03-23

I read this book when I was in high school because I had an older brother who thought that Carlos Casteneda was &quot;the man&quot;.  So with fear and anticipation I read through this book, hoping that it wasn't too far  over my head.  For awhile it seemed ok, but then it goes off the deep-end.   He talks about how we all have these invisible tentacles coming out of our  belly-buttons and we can use them for rock climbing and for stopping  charging mountain lions.  The author must know that if he said this right  off the bat people would laught at it.  But if you're halfway through the  book he figures that if you've read that far that you'll buy anything he  says.  When I came to these passages I was shocked, I thought I wouldn't be  smart enough for the book, I didn't expect it to be just plain silly.  Does  anyone wonder if &quot;Jack in the Beanstalk&quot; is true?<br />Anyway, I  read through the whole thing, mostly because I was wondering if he would  explain that he was just kidding about the belly tentacles thing.  But that  never happened.  To make matters worse my mother noticed how I'd read the  whole book, assumed I must have liked it, and got me another one for my  birthday!  So then I had two of these books on my bookshelf, it was so  embarassing because to visitors it would look like I BELIEVED these silly  ramblings.<br />If you're the kind of person who likes these things, fine.

Perhaps this book is so popular because of the timing of when it was published and since then it has run on its own momentum.  In any case, to the curious reader, be prepared for an unoriginal, mostly dry, dull book.  If one wants and intro to Philosophy, one would do better to read Durant's  &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot;, Russell's &quot;History of Western  Philosophy&quot;, or nearly any intro to philosophy written by someone  qualified to speak on the subject.  The attribute lacking in the author of  &quot;Zen&quot; is humility.  He seems to think that any pedestrian insight  he has is original with him.  He does not seem to be aware of even the  basics of western philisophical thought.  Although he apparently has had  much classroom instruction on the matter, maybe he doesn't listen well, or  he can't give credit to others for having ideas also.<br />On the positive  side he has a few good analogies, but these are few and far between.  If  the point of the book is that &quot;quality&quot; is a mysterious word  because its difficult to define, that's true of many words, try to define  &quot;the&quot; or &quot;of&quot;.  Is his point we should not always chose  quantity over quality?  Oh ,please!  That is hardly an original idea.  The  author and his fans seem to believe that any idea that crosses his mind is  worthy of worldwide attention.  A dialogue on philosophy has been going on  for hundreds of years, and many very bright people have contributed their  thoughts.  It is very naive and arrogant to imagine that one's own thoughts  would revolutionize the subject (although that is what every barroom  know-it-all believes).  Professing one's adoration for this book only gives  away one's ignorance.	2000-03-23

They start out fairly well grounded, then (assuming that if you've read this far you accept anything the author says) they go off the  deep-end.<br />The book starts off with a tale of playing golf with a man  called Chivas Irons, and this is ok.  Then it wanders into of all things:  physics!  Mr. Murphy seems to feel that our current crop of physics P.H.D.s  have it all wrong, and that they should come to him to get straightened  out.  He talks about &quot;true gravity&quot; and all sorts of stuff.  Then  there is a chapter called &quot;We are all Kites in the Wind&quot;.   Interesting analogy you say?  No analogy, he means it!  He states that we  are all acutally kites in the wind!  What is the evidence for this  statement? None is given.<br />As you have probably guessed by now, this book  isn't about golf.  It's about...., ahhhh,...whatever - you tell me.  If you  are the sort of person who likes silly things, claiming that proves  &quot;open-mindedness&quot; and &quot;imagination&quot;, then you'll  probably like this book.  If you are looking for a book on golf  instruction, you'll be bitterly dissappointed.	2000-03-23

That is, it should show lots of examples of what math can be used FOR, with little emphasis on  pedantic matters (such as rationalizing the denominator). This book fits  the bill.  It has examples that people would like to USE, such as figuring  their loan payments and predicting how tall their child will grow.  It also  shows some interesting new connections, showing how the gravitaional  formula can be used to predict how many phone calls occur between cities.

Several examples of bad reasoning even come from another logic book, i.e. 'Thinking Straight'!

It is often  pointed out that foes of the death penalty wouldn't feel that way for the  killers of their own family.

People believe all sorts of incorrect ideas about how probability works, i.e. gambler's fallacy.  'Randomness' approaches the subject in an  understandable way, avoiding some of the micro details that a textbook  would get into.  The book also goes into some of the history of thinking  about probablity.  For example, for years it was thought that throwing  dice, drawing lots, etc. those outcomes represented the will of God.  I  think this book has things of interest for nearly everyone, from expert to  layman.	1999-12-22

In some ways though this has its problems, for example he errors in explaining the  impact of inflation.  He states that 5% inflation reduces your buying power  by a factor of .95, this is incorrect, it would reduce it by a factor of  1/1.05 which equals .9524 (approximately), this is close to .95, but not  the same, and this error is entirely germaine to his argument in that  chapter. Many of the chapters seems to be more on business management than  arithmetic and I didn't expect that when I was buying the book.

But I  think it is the best introduction to philosophy that I have seen, and one  that would also be accessible to a bright early teen.	1999-12-18

She spares neither the right nor the left, i.e. she criticizes the religious right and the growing new age movement.  I  paticularly like that she stated that while it is fashionable to ridicule  the new age as being irrational, it is taboo to do this to any mainstream  religion, no matter how far-fetched its tenets may be.  I liked that  because that is a very rare thing to do, in fact, it may even be unique to  Kaminer as far as I know.	1999-12-18

One of the most amusing aspects of the negative reviews  is that Russell is stated as being &quot;bad at logic&quot;.  This  assesment against one of the greatest logicians of this or any century!   What are the qualification of these reviewers?  One must suppose it is  their indignation at how a person absolutely destroys the Christian dogmas  in about 10 pages.  A book one simply must own, even if one disagrees!	1999-12-18
