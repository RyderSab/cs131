Only a novel could incorporate a twentieth century history of the Ukraine under Stalin, an evocation of immigrant cultural archetypes, a documentary on aging in the industrial west and tell it in Jane Austen-like prose that resonates with the humor of a Woody Allen movie.  Did I mention that in engaging slivers of commentary, you get an interesting  history of tractors - in English!

A scholarly, yet accessible, performance by Mr. Wills, who clearly does not relish any attempt to place Jefferson in disrepute, but cannot rein in his regard for the truth about this enigmatic president, in all his complexity.	2005-04-22

Jack Reacher, hired by a top secret service field officer to &quot;consult&quot; and beef up the security afforded our vice-president, is given no ear piece with which to communicate with the other secret service agents he is ostensibly monitoring and spends over 90% of the book carrying around a ceramic knife rather than a gun.  This leads to some really preposterous moments like when Jack, sensing someone is in a church belfry noisily climbs ladders pirate-like with his knife in his teeth and thinking thoughts of how surprised the bad guy's going to be when invincible Jack bursts through the trap door.  Most of this book is concerned with letting us know that Jack is really a tough guy and his ex-military female side-kick is . . . my gosh, even TOUGHER.  Disappointing.	2003-05-28

Her focus on Dietrich, Bankhead and Garbo gives the book a continuity to really assess the impact of lesbianism in Hollywood.  But the tide also brings in some fascinating silent stars, and many others including Barbara Stanwyck and Marilyn Monroe.

Hiney's triumph is showing what an interesting life it was, nonetheless.  Chandler was just a writer who loved words more than he loved people, who loaded up his cynicism in neat little rounds and fired at humanity with some precision.  That same cynicism drove him to view life through the bottom of a shot glass, at no little cost to his art (or I suppose as some might argue to enhance his art).  Mostly he wanted to get it right - mostly he did, especially in \\"The Long Goodbye\\".  I like that Hiney doesn't let the  extraordinary Mr. Marlowe overshadow the strains of ordinariness in Chandler's character.  I certainly enjoy Chandler's fiction the greater for this very good life.	2003-03-08

Contrary to the conclusion drawn by the author, the sources he relies upon demonstrate that Lincoln was ethical in the zealous representation of his client, an accused murderer.  Even under today's legal standards, Lincoln would have been correct to instruct a witness that he was only interested in the witness's ability to testify on a single factual aspect of the trial and to instruct the witness to tell him nothing else except the truth about that single fact.  During his preparation for trial, when the witness tried to stray from his instructions and inform Lincoln of other observations, Lincoln would have been within his right to interrupt and remind him that he mustn't offer additional observations beyond the fact requested.  <br />Even today we instruct juries that they may believe all, part, or none of a witness's testimony.  Lawyers are held to no different standards in their use of witnesses at trial except lawyers may not offer a witness whose testimony the lawyer believes would commit a fraud upon the court.  Lincoln never placed this witness on the stand to elicit any testimony other than what the witness stated to be the truth.  Thus the claim that Lincoln \\"suborned perjury\\" is naive and insulting.  For all that, I enjoyed the underlying research, and the author's exposition of it.  It does strike me that consultation with an attorney would have vastly improved the history and dampened the sensationalism.	2003-01-07

This is whiskey without the water.   A strangely vulnerable Churchill comes across in these pages - tired, too old , and dragging his snail's tail of disasters from Galipoli to his support of Edward the Abdicator.

Have you noticed how many \\"novels\\" today are really just screenplays without the stage directions?  I believe the term in Hollywood is a \\"treatment\\".

The prose is crisp and mercifully unaffected by the stylistic impenetrability of Johnson's writings.  One can see the journal as a travel book, but it is more akin to an 18th century version of William Least Heat Moon's &quot;Blue Highways&quot;.

The coalescence of several improbable dynamics ended the cold war; the cult of personalty in American politics, the verve and risk-taking of Gorby, and the public penchant for a quick fix for the nuclear nightmare.   As revealing of human nature as Gravity's Rainbow or Catch-22, only  funnier.	2000-05-04

This uneven account misses the textures to be found in Bruce Catton's 2 volume biography, regretably now out of print.  Although Catton's account at times borders on hagiography, his prose vividly recreates the time and  Grant's life is lent a richer context than the feeble broth doled out by  Simpson.  I found it amusing that Simpson's introduction fails to pay  homage to Catton's effort and even suggests that Catton half-heartedly  wrapped up a project begun by another historian.	2000-03-15

Pynchon's title is a punchline too.  That the ascent and  decline of man should so perfectly match this symbol of technology in its  trajectory; that it will  be the source of man's ultimate destruction is as  funny as the Apollo moon launch originating at Penemunde.  So I'm saving  the rest of this book for that time when I will be desperate for a really  good laugh.  On some nuclear rainy day.	1999-09-08

The Amazon.com reviewer and others have overlooked Larsons rare prose style which leaches out the emotion ordinarily attending the struggle between evolutionists and creationists.  Not really written for the broad audience that ordinarily attracts the Pulitzer prize.	1998-05-16

The author's proof itself constitutes a facinating journey into the history of creative thought; the evocation of the childhoods of Darwin, Voltaire and Frederick the Great lend powerful support to the thesis. Sulloway's use of statistics is shockingly understandable even for someone who fled from Statistics 101. The prose flows like a wonderful after-dinner conversation; but after this feast the world is seen anew.  If my allusion to Alfred Wallace escapes you, check this book out	1997-03-07
