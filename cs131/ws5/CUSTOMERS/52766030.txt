The book reads a bit satirically -- think of your standard baby care book but written like a VCR manual. But it's actually useful information; we had our first child born recently, and it's been really useful to us. I've ended up buying copies for friends, too. Once you figure out a few of the slightly less obvious &quot;terms&quot; (like &quot;service provider&quot; for &quot;doctor&quot;), it's easy to read and avoids a lot of the editorializing and &quot;my baby was this way&quot; found in similar books. Worth the time.	2004-01-30

On the one hand, writers are expected to (within reason) stick closely to actual events, at least when the events in the novel connect to historical timelines. Similarly with personalities, customs, technology, cultural developments, etc. On the other hand, the fact that it's fiction gives the author leeway in inventing new characters, motivations, and in general peering into the details of history that we couldn't possibly know. <br />&quot;Quicksilver&quot; is the latest offering from Neal Stephenson, an author known better for his science fiction than novels set in the late 17th century as this one is. It's a monster of a novel (944 pages) and is really only the first of three novels in the Baroque Cycle. It's not as far away from his other writing as one might think, however, as many of the characters are the ancestors of various characters in &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, which itself followed two or three generations of some of these same families (Waterhouse, Shaftoe, etc.) <br />Unfortunately, the novel meanders so much that it's nigh on impossible to give a plot summary. In fact, the novel seems to putter to a stop rather than climax. It starts out as flashbacks interleaved with events in the early 18th century, but this device doesn't last long and we're left in the Daniel Waterhouse's college days with Isaac Newton. Eventually we begin to follow Bob Shaftoe, then a Qwghlmian woman named Eliza. These three cross paths at various times and interact with other historical figures like Leibniz, Louis XIV, Robert Hooke, and so forth. Stephenson is his usual clever self, but this time it seems more like showing off rather than entertaining as in prior writing.<br />To be honest, despite a few exciting moments, this was a singularly uncompelling read. By the last third of the novel, I continued reading it out of sheer doggedness rather than any interest in what would happen. Interlocking plot lines are great, but there should be a common thread to make the reader care about the characters and their various fates. As an experiment in historical science fiction, it's worth some time. Stephenson is simultaneously experimenting on the Internet with Real Character writing and a Wiki with more information about various characters and events in the novel (allowing reader input and editing). But novels have to stand on their own two feet, not just as a gimmick, but as worthwhile reads. &quot;Quicksilver&quot; just doesn't cut it, which is a shame: Stephenson is capable of so much more.	2004-01-11
US	52766030	R13BVWABUA64LG	0385499086	218243212	Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency	Books	5	11	16	N	N	Opinionated but definitely worthwhile	Body of Secrets is essentially a sequel to The Puzzle Palace, published twenty years ago to give something of a face to the National Security Agency (NSA). The NSA is responsible for signals and electronic intelligence for the US government and in fact is several times larger than its better known cousin, the Central Intelligence Agency. The book is presented primarily as a chronological history of the famously-secretive agency, starting with its beginnings at the close of World War II and the beginning of the US struggle against Communism and progressing to the post-September 11th era.<br />NSA operations against North Korea are discussed, including some early diplomatic/military problems caused by operational mistakes. The agency's early technology and organization are described in some detail, using now-declassified documents as sources. Some of the key figures in this era are described, and quick mini-biographies give the reader a basic understanding of who these individuals were and what motivated them. A great deal of time is also spent discussing reconnaissance overflights of the USSR, including the infamous U2 flight by Gary Powers that was shot down. Bamford takes this opportunity to criticize President Eisenhower, who is represented in the book as a corrupt, scheming politico scared to take responsibility for his actions.<br />But his criticism isn't limited to Eisenhower: the NSA's role in Cuba is dissected as well, such as for the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban missile crisis. The Joint Chiefs of Staff bear the brunt of Bamford's fury here, as he documents numerous efforts to incite a US-Cuba war (including a treasonous terrorism campaign to be waged in the US and blamed on the Cubans).<br />The use of naval ships to gather signals intelligence (Sigint) and electronics intelligence (Elint) is also outlined, including a number of episodes that resulted in captured ships and men, including one ship captured by the North Koreans as well as the NSA role in the Gulf of Tonkin incident that President Johnson used as a pretext for the Vietnam war. The author takes great pains to describe the USS Liberty incident involving Israel's attack on an NSA ship during the Six Day War. Interestingly, while this review was being written, the NSA released additional information on this incident that supports the author's position.<br />Bamford also catalogues NSA activity in Vietnam, including the first US soldier killed there (an NSA operative). While he may have little respect for much of the senior command structure, his respect and admiration for the grunts is clear as he outlines the many sacrifices they made in the service of their country even when poor decisions were being made far above them. This is a key theme of the book, actually: while the President and his staff sometimes didn't do what the author believes to be the right thing, the individual NSAers were sweating it out in impossible conditions to follow orders and protect their cause.<br />Given so much discussion of the monitoring activity and technology of the NSA, the issue of civil liberties is important here. Transgressions were made, and many of them are listed and analyzed in the book. Body of Secrets has multiple meanings here: certainly this sort of airing of past sins is revealing of a lot of secrets that many folks would rather never see out in the open. In particular, Bamford presents large amounts of evidence regarding the targeting of individuals in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.<br />As the book reaches the modern era (post-1980), its tone changes from a historical account to a more general statistical analysis and description. This is probably due to the recent (and therefore still-classified) nature of the data that would provide more texture here. Hopefully, in another twenty years these stories can be told as well, particularly those involving satellite imagery and Echelon. The book also discusses the modern challenges facing the NSA, both technological (the telecom explosion, the Internet, etc.) and organizational (funding, competition for talent, etc.). An afterword addresses September 11th, but in reality the NSA involvement in this section is only tangential.<br />Both a well-researched archive and a riveting account of the history of the NSA, Body of Secrets is a fascinating look inside one of the most reclusive and insular US government agencies. It provides another perspective on many key events in modern US history and is well worth the time a reader invests in it. Bamford's leanings in the book are clear and, while occasionally distracting, probably inevitable. For those interested in the NSA, it's indispensible and unmatched.	2003-10-18

While the author evidently knows the subject matter well, the book reads as if it were written to be read aloud rather than just read. Confusingly, it's not really written chronologically, either. <br />But it's pretty good anyway, and offers an excellent, though brief, summary of the events of fall 2001 without dwelling overly long on subjects (like September 11) that we're all quite familiar with. The author also spends some time reviewing the &quot;person of interest&quot;, Stephen J. Hatfield, and his background. It's a short read (I read it cover to cover in about a day), but it's worth it.	2003-09-21

Some of the stories are fairly interesting and my eyes were opened to some of the circumstances faced by folks living in central Africa. But the book feels like it lacks a point; it's really a collection of short recollections (4-20 pages each), sometimes with very little tying them together. More maps would have been useful, and the end of the book has more information about &quot;level 4&quot; labs constructed to examine these viruses in safety. The book wasn't a waste of time but it didn't have what I was looking for, which was a focus on the mindset of the doctors as they investigated the various viruses. It's pretty decent evening reading, though.	2003-06-23

It basically consists of excerpts from works by Confucius, Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, etc. This was a mistake: while I've read some of the works included here, and was just hoping to discover some others that appealed to me, jumping in the middle isn't conducive to that like I had hoped it would be. The &quot;mental whiplash&quot; between one reading to another is just too great for me. I need time to find the rhythm of the writing, to really be able to follow the flow of the writer's thoughts. And each excerpt really isn't half an hour long (except for some of the more convoluted writings, like Aquinas's). Somebody else might enjoy it, but not me.	2003-06-12

It's not too clinical, though it does have sections in each chapter for what's going on with the mother, the baby, and you. The writer isn't afraid to reveal the worries and concerns he had through his wife's pregnancies, and he takes the time to speak to adoptive fathers and those whose pregnancies end in miscarriage. So he doesn't try too hard to write a &quot;guy&quot; book, and at the same time isn't overly sensitive and touchy-feely. It's a nice balance of a human voice while still being informative. I'm really glad I bought it, and it's definitely recommended reading for other men who are new to the whole process. In fact, it might even be useful for those who have gone through it before, but I'm not sure, not having been there yet myself.	2003-05-06

A scientist in Gainesville detects an approaching spaceship, and the news causes some upheaval, though not as much as might be expected. Nothing new, it would seem, but Haldeman keeps the focus almost entirely within Gainesville: very little of the action takes place outside the university town. The novel feels stretched out: it probably would have made a fine short story, but as a novel it left me thinking, &quot;This is it? This is all we get?&quot; Without giving away the ending, it's not a particularly satisfying one. Haldeman doesn't really explain the why of the plot. In fact, the plot feels like just so much baggage while he expounds on a few social themes, like the criminalization of homosexuality and the implications of real traffic control. In the end, Haldeman has many interesting ideas (as always) but it was stretched out far too long. He's a fine author with lots to say - just not here.	2003-04-19
US	52766030	RUSUYGIV10TO4	0120586908	333918453	Elementary Linear Algebra, Second Edition	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Excellent	I used this in my undergrad course as a math major at UT Dallas. I really enjoyed it; the book has sections on applications in just about every chapter, and there are lots of computational exercises as well. In addition to answers to odd-numbered exercises, each chapter has a &quot;self-test&quot; with all the answers provided at the back of the book. It's a bit chatty, but that befits an undergrad text.<br />This is a good book for self-study, though if you are really serious about it, you might want to supplement it with a more rigorous reference (the Dettman text is good for this).	2002-12-15

The book is written at a good level: not as rigorous as a typical grad textbook, but not as chatty as many modern undergrad textbooks. This allows the reader to focus on the material and have it well-explained without being distracted or treated like a junior high student. The book contains no answers for any of the exercises. If I was not using it for self-study, this wouldn't be a problem. There are a few places where he does a bit of handwaving or is a bit lazy in his definitions (see the definition of &quot;subgroup&quot; on p. 207 for an example), but this does not overly detract from the quality.<br />While it's not perfect, I'm very happy with the book for my somewhat limited purposes. I'd like to give it 3.5 stars, but I'll be generous and round to 4 since I can't.	2002-12-14
US	52766030	R5V21UE5689CP	0375400524	841119426	The First World War	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Definitive work with a few minor flaws	The First World War is a military history of the various campaigns that comprised World War One, written from a largely British perspective. This is to be expected, given that the author served as the senior lecturer in military history at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. His analytic perspective lends a classic air to a genre that in modern times seems to focus more on the individual soldier and less on the sweeping themes of a war. The book is both informative and incisive, and should be read by those who have not gained more than a cursory knowledge of the Great War. <br />The book is organized chronologically, with some years separated into separate chapters by theater. The reader is thus led to an understanding of the strategic considerations that led to the decisions made, even when the results were tragically unexpected. In fact, Keegan's main thrust seems to be on the futility of the war itself, accomplishing little except wholesale slaughter, as well as on the mysteries accompanying World War One. That is, not how was the war conducted, but why?<br />The opening year of the war, 1914, is treated with the most depth. Chapters 1-3 cover the preliminaries and the opening stages of the war. Chapter 4 covers the war of movement on the Western Front, one of the few times on that front when static trench warfare was not the rule of the day. Chapter 5 covers the same time period on the Eastern Front. The coverage of 1915 is split between Chapter 6, discussing entrenchment, and Chapter 7, discussing the war in the South and East, various colonies, and Gallipoli. Keegan then runs quickly through 1916 in Chapter 8, where he examines the battles of Jutland, the Somme, Verdun, and Brusilov. Similarly, 1917 is covered rather quickly in Chapter 9 with a review of war weariness, the Russian Revolution, and the US' entry into the war. Chapter 10 ties it all together, describing the (temporary) end of the war.<br />The style is a bit dry, but then that should be expected from a work of this sort. The First World War is relatively heavy reading, requiring more thought and engagement from the reader than typical popular history. Occasionally, he makes assumptions about the reader's level of knowledge that, in this reviewer's experience, were set a tad high. For example, there is quite a bit of mention made of the Teutonic knights and the tradition that the Prussian army inherited, but many readers will not be as familiar with the Teutons as the author seems to expect. The maps are often inadequate and leave the reader wondering just how to visualize the geographic progression of a campaign, though the maps that are included were laid out nicely. The motivated reader, however, will gain much from the book, and Keegan's organization is quite logical. He has an excellent understanding of the flow of military operations, and the book overall tastes of a treatise on military strategy. Of course, factual notes are well supported, and the bibliography is practically a definitive summary of the best analysis and knowledge regarding the war.<br />Personally, this reviewer gained much from the book, and it's recommended as a fine overview of the war to anyone who's interested enough in the subject to give it the time and attention it deserves. It may not be an easy read, but the payoff is worth the investment.	2002-11-29

Don't expect in-depth technical treatment, but it's a decnt introduction to abstract algebra, covering basic properties of the integers, groups, sets &amp; mappings, rings &amp; fields, polynomials, Euclidean constructions, and some additional material on the integers and coding (from the table of contents). We used it in my undergrad course, and it was one of the simpler courses I've seen. All in all, not a bad way to go if you're just looking to dip your toes in abstract algebra.

Robert Massie lays out the development of the Dreadnought-class battleship and its implications, beginning with Queen Victoria's ascension to the throne and ending with the declaration of World War I. The focus is on the monarchies and constitutional governments, and the book closes with the sequence of declarations of general European war in the summer of 1914.<br />Interestingly, the book does so from a biographical perspective. Virtually every word is focused on giving the reader a clear picture of the personalities involved, from the Queen herself to Kaiser Wilhelm (referred to unfailingly as William in the book), from Cecil Rhodes to Prince Bismarck. This makes the book somewhat more readable, but leaves the reader with the impression that the arms race (and thus the War) is entirely due to individual personalities. Very little time or attention is given to broader social developments, reducing the citizenry of each nation to little more than observers, often even less given the secrecy behind many of the developments.<br />Kaiser Wilhelm is especially closely considered, making it clear that, at least in part, his own inferiority complex and vacillation between Anglophilia and Anglophobia led to Germany's near-inexorable march towards war. At times, he desired nothing more than the acceptance and respect of his grandmother and uncle (Victoria and Edward VII); at others, he would repudiate any possible tempering influence they might have had. After Bismarck, one chancellor after another rotated through the government, serving at the Emperor's pleasure (due to Bismarck's design in the constitution). Still, the volatile Emperor was occasionally easily manipulated by experienced politicians without realizing it. In most cases, this maintained peace and allowed the danger of war to pass.<br />Particular attention is also given to Admiral Jacky Fisher, whose reforms in the British Navy at the close of its heyday are still seen in modern navies all over the world. During the great sail-to-steam conversion, it was his focus on gunnery and simulation of wartime situations that kept his Navy at the top of the game. Realizing the importance of speed in naval operations, he continued to push for steam vessels even when this was still controversial. The development of the modern battleship is due in large part to his driving force, constantly seeking to defend his island nation.<br />Dreadnought does a fine job of illustrating the developments, both military and political, that led to the declaration of one of the most important wars of the last century, little-discussed though it may be. While Dreadnought spends practically no time on the war itself, gaining familiarity with this era of history leads to a sense of sadness at the loss of the world's innocence nearly one hundred years ago.	2002-10-09

It's currently being used in my undergrad PDE course, and the flow of material is a bit out of the ordinary. The book starts off with the method of characteristics and weak solutions, which are slightly more sophisticated and unusual topics than some of the later material, making it difficult to get started. The focus on using Matlab is nice, and most things are fairly well-explained. Typographical errors are rampant, however, making it very poor for self-study (you need someone to point out the errors to you).<br />All in all, not bad -- the second edition will hopefully be much better, and if you have a decent grounding in multivariate calc and ODE's, you'll be OK.	2002-02-03

It's an interesting survey of applied mathematics; a number of sub-disciplines are covered here.<br />He does an excellent job of bringing the math down to a reasonable level without dumbing it down. Most of the book can be understood with simple logic and algebra; truly understanding a few of the theorems (not just appreciating them) does take a little calculus. Knowing some more advanced math (like topology) helps, but a reasonably mathematically-inclined person with less formal education will be able to follow it just fine. I'd like to see more popular math books at this level; this is somewhere between the level of Paulos' series of books (\\"Innumeracy\\" et al) and an undergrad maths textbook.<br />It's interesting to see a side of mathematics not often covered in high school maths courses. I really recommend this book to anyone with more than a passing interest in mathematics; it may even rejuvenate your interest to a more active level.	2001-03-01

Look up the word in the Concordance, get the word's number, look it up in the dictionary. Pretty simple, really. Unfortunately, though, he acts as if the root of a word is the same as the definition; this is not quite true. Getting the root does help with a deeper understanding, but it's not the &quot;true&quot; definition of the word. A few of the examples (ref. John 1:1) are also flawed, as he throws in his own explanation (along the lines &quot;but of course that's not what it means because of X&quot;). The coupons in the back are a nice value, though.<br />If you've never done even the most cursory etymology, this book might be useful for about five minutes.

US	52766030	R2NQ0XOY9GRNC1	0671737120	676425212	Sword Point	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Decent but not outstanding	This is a decent showing. There's no central character, but that seems to have been intentional: by not focusing too much on any particular individual, we get glimpses of the effect of war on various soldiers on both sides. There are numerous flaws, though, most notably the fact that there seems to be very little reason to set the battle in Iran. Maybe by setting the novel in an &quot;out-of-the-way&quot; country, Coyle wanted to avoid too many preconceived notions on the part of the reader. Unfortunately, since for the most part nothing is done in the book to really set the book in Iran (other than desert battles and fanatic Iranians), the setting is mostly an afterthought.<br />Further, Coyle doesn't delve as deeply into the motivations of his characters as he did in &quot;Team Yankee&quot;, which is a far better thought-out novel. Major Scott Dixon, a recurring character in several of Coyle's later novels, makes his appearances, and there are some particularly moving moments. especially towards the conclusion of the novel, involving dead American soldiers. But the strategy of not spending too much time on any particular character has the sad effect of making it difficult to really care about any of them.<br />One other notable characteristic is the fact that the reader is never given much of an explanation or rationalization of the US' involvement in a Soviet invasion of Iran. At first, this was a major annoyance, until it dawned on me that Coyle was making a subtle point about soldiers as implements of policy without necessarily understanding those policies or even knowing what they are, similar to Vietnam.<br />Overall, this isn't as good a novel as his first effort &quot;Team Yankee&quot;, which did a better job of exploring the psyche of the line soldier (Coyle's fundamental motif). But it's decent enough on its own. The author has a point he's trying to make, and he does indeed do so.	2000-11-15

And that's a shame, because there's a lot to be learned here.<br />The book reviews the history of a number of countries and regions, and does a pretty good job at it. It's obviously not the most in-depth treatment; the subject is too broad to allow that. But neither does it gloss over key events and concepts; it's long enough to be able to hit the high points.<br />If you have an interest in the history of Latin America but don't have much of a foundation on which to start, this will give you an excellent beginning point.	2000-11-05

I'm a system administrator for a large website. I bought this book in my previous job because of all the projects I had to handle, either as a lead or as a key team member. Like many people, I'm often a project manager even though I'm not a Project Manager. The book helped some; I got some of the terminology down and at least now I can follow most of a technical discussion about project management.<br />That said, 80% of project management is common sense and being organized and responsible. The other 20%, the technical side, is useful, but don't fool yourself. There are probably better PM books out there, especially if you're totally unaccustomed to leading any sort of project. But if you're a pretty organized person who just wants to see what the fuss is all about, this isn't a bad choice.	2000-11-05

Just need to be able to look up the details of a specific tag from time to time? Then this will work well for you. If you're like me and every once in a while get tripped up by a syntax nuance, then this will be just what you need. The examples are occasionally unclear, and it's missing a few details here and there, but for the most part, it has exactly what you need. Its compactness also means that it doesn't waste your time trying to teach; the conciseness is a breath of fresh hair in a world of &quot;Astrophysics for Drooling Morons&quot; books. <br />Even though it's slightly flawed, I use it constantly.	2000-11-02

The material is dry and not presented in an educational material.<br />However, if you need a good reference to various aspects of this subject, it's pretty good. Some of the material is slightly out-of-date, but for the most part, it serves well when there's a small detail that's bugging you, or you need to just refresh your memory about something.	2000-11-02
US	52766030	R3OSJC6QVORITC	0130212229	603517961	Unix Shells by Example	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Good text	As has been pointed out, the book has four foci: grep/awk/sed, Bourne shell, Korn shell, and C shell. If you're not familiar with the ins and outs of these areas, it's an excellent book. Instead of buying four different books for each area, this will allow you to become comfortable with each one. It's not a reference book; the charts and tables are occasionally incomplete and not well-organized for reference, since their purpose is generally to illustrate a point. If you're already familiar with shell programming and just need a reference or an advanced book, look elsewhere, but if you need to get up to speed quickly, this is far superior to many other, similar textbooks.	2000-11-02
US	52766030	R2ZKEYK6XIWT5F	0380788624	555229230	Cryptonomicon	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	He really gets it	If you're a hacker, or even think you know what one is, you need to read this book. Once you're done, you'll have an astoundingly accurate picture of what a hacker *really* is (not necessarily what CNN says we are), and you'll have enjoyed a well-written story to boot.<br />The plot is quite intricate, and jumps back and forth from WWII to the modern day with gleeful abandon. The characters are mostly well-written, though with so many, it's inevitable that you'll be left wanting to know some of them better (Randy's grandfather comes to mind here). Like Clancy, there's lots of technical information thrown in, but it really does advance the plot, not just display the author's technical prowess -- in most cases, anyway. This may be the first novel I've ever read with a Perl script in it, and definitely the first that devotes several pages to the proper way to eat Captain Crunch.<br />Be prepared to spend lots of time with this novel. If you're a hacker, you'll identify deeply with a number of the characters. If you're not, don't worry -- there's lots of other folk in there. And the story is great. Definitely a good investment of your entertainment dollar.	2000-10-25

This seminal voyage was on par with the modern-day ventures into space, and the voyagers for the most part were far less imperialistic than, say, the conquistadors further south and much earlier in time.<br />As usual, Ambrose writes with an infectious passion. He obviously admired Meriwether Lewis, though not unconditionally so. He infuses the story with an excitement that turns it into a real page-turner, although this certainly had no negative effect on his scholarship. The portrait of Thomas Jefferson, the real mover and shaker behind the voyage, is interesting as well, especially since so many young Americans are taught so little about perhaps the most influential man in the history of the United States.<br />If you are laboring under the illusion that US history is boring and lacking any epic stories, Ambrose will change your mind.	2000-10-25

The vocabulary is so basic that the definitions wouldn't teach much to a 10-year-old. If you don't speak Spanish, then you need an English-Spanish dictionary, which this is not.<br />My wife is from Monterrey, Mexico. She got so frustrated with the book that she finally just left it in one of my bookcases. But it didn't do me any good, either, even though I'm a native English speaker. Every word we looked up simply wasn't there.<br />If you want a good Spanish-only dictionary, check out &quot;Diccionario Larousse Del Espanol Moderno : A New Dictionary of the Spanish Language&quot; by Ramon Garcia-Pelayo Y Gross. We bought this one later, and it's quite serviceable, though still a little incomplete. Check out my review there for more info on it.	2000-10-25
US	52766030	R1MOAP20L3YIT	0553283685	47311872	Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos)	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	SF's Canterbury Tales	The book is sort of a collection of several pilgrims telling their reasons for making a pilgrimage to the planet of Hyperion, home of the Time Tombs and the mysteriously lethal Shrike. It's quite fantastic, and framed by a story that lends an eerie urgency to the tales.<br />A number of the tales are quite moving, particularly those of the priest and the wandering Jew. Simmons has several interesting things to say about religion, so be prepared to see challenges to your own beliefs, whatever those may be. This is not a novel that shies away from tackling tough issues, and Simmons does so in some fairly unconventional ways. <br />It's quite fantastic; this is definitely not hard SF. The focus is on character development; in fact, it could almost be said that the tales are each extended character sketches. A warning: this book doesn't stand on its own too well, thus the four stars. It works best as a part of the series of novels that Simmons has based on Hyperion. Once you're done -- well, you're not. The story hasn't ended, it just stops. This works on two levels: one as an introduction to the next novel, &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;; and two, as a statement on the essential unknowability of the universe.	2000-10-25

I have an excellent Spanish-English dictionary  (the American Heritage), but that didn't work too well for her, and I had  progressed far enough that I needed one that didn't refer back to English.  I first bought her a piece of junk (the Diccionario Practico De La Lengua  Espanola Del Nuevo Mundo); nothing we looked up was already there! It  became quite clear to us that this was the most fundamental dictionary;  anyone who spoke Spanish didn't need it.<br />Fortunately, this dictionary  saved us. While still not as extensive as we might like, it's comprehensive  enough that nearly everything we look up is in there. I'm still looking for  the truly comprehensive Spanish dictionary she wants, but this is quite  serviceable.	2000-08-24
