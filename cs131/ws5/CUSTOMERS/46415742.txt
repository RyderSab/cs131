Yes, the always-annoying Susan appears in only 2 out of 65 chapters--and in one of these only by phone.  Her absence is refreshing, and Spenser seems full of vim and vinegar without her. <br /> <br />Her replacements--the leggy nutcase Beth Ann Blair and the insatiable firecracker Rita Fiore--are great. <br /> <br />I must warn you, though [SPOILER ALERT!!!!!], the book does end tragically: Susan comes back. <br /> <br />Almost all the other usual suspects are absent, too: no Hawk (!), no Quirk, almost no Belson, no Vinny, and so on.   <br /> <br />The series seems to perk up for the loss.  The great American detectives have always been loners, and, bereft of his usual crew, Spenser seems liberated and renewed. <br /> <br />One of the nicest things about the book (apart from the missing Susan, which is exhilarating) is Spenser's or Parker's withering take on suburbia.  This is a constant in the Spenser books, and never is the indictment fiercer than here.	2005-09-29

Terrific premise--that Hitler had not lost WWII--and reasonably well-made characters. <br /> <br />Then I read \\"Enigma\\" and hated it.  I kept expecting it to get better.  It never did.  Unlike \\"Fatherland,\\" \\"Enigma\\" merely stuck to facts--the breaking of the German code in WWII.  The characters were lifeless and the plot a snore. <br /> <br />\\"Pompeii\\" is more like \\"Enigma\\"--no messing with actual history; just a fictional rendition of it. <br /> <br />And it is equally dull.  I teach Latin, so I know the history and the details.  The fictional characters are one-dimensional at best; more like zero-dimensional.  They are predictable and uninteresting.  And the plot, of course, is known beforehand.  The romance has no sparks. <br /> <br />If you want to learn some history, this book will teach you.  But as a novel it is dry, dry, dry.	2005-07-29

The heroine is literally an Ice Queen because she freezes her heart and her life, after impulsively wishing her mother dead and (she thinks) causing it to happen. <br /> <br />Not even the blinding heat of Florida can warm her; it takes a lightning-strike to begin to thaw her emotions out.  And it takes more than one lightning-strike.  For a time her lover is a twice-struck man; and her only friend is a lightning-struck boy (both of whom also go through dying-to-be-reborn episodes). <br /> <br />The heroine does eventually thaw her emotions--but again, not without undergoing death, this time the death of her beloved brother.   <br /> <br />She also finds new life in her brother's daughter--who can be the girl the heroine never allowed herself to be. <br /> <br />The story doesn't so much have a plot as themes.  The main theme is: accept love or die, literally or figuratively.  But love keeps reaching out, no matter how many times it is refused.  And it isn't just people who offer love: as always with Hoffman, nature offers love, even in its harshest forms, like lightning, like death, if only we recognize it. <br /> <br />So this book is less like a conventional novel and more like a large poem: connections keep reappearing and deepening, everything connects to everything else, till a critical mass is reached and the book starts to breathe, like something alive. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-15

Requiem\\"), but it is still very good. <br /> <br />In the first place, it contains almost none of Lucy--a definite step forward. <br /> <br />In the second, it contains quite a lot of Starkey (from \\"Demolition Angel\\"), and she is interesting and unpredictable. <br /> <br />In the third, it manages to deal with Elvis Coles's family and background in an offbeat and intriguing way.  (Unlike Sue Grafton's regrettable efforts to go into Kinsey Milhone's family, say.) <br /> <br />The best thing may be Crais's wonderful depiction of Cole's aloneness.  This is the classic alienation of the private detective, and Crais does it marvelously. <br /> <br />The only bad thing is the near-absence of Pike.  Still, a very fine book.	2005-07-08

Parker is surely coasting.  There really is no plot--a fact which Spenser and Hawk try repeatedly to make into a joke but which is less funny the more they try. <br />The standard characters appear, but mostly as cardboard cutouts.  (The exception is Vinnie, who is likable but too brief.)  There are really no themes, except the tired one of Vengeance.  Yawn. <br /> <br />And the Ugly is quite intrusive.  The ugliest thing about the Spenser books has always been Susan.  She is odious.  Narcissistic, vain, shallow, not very bright, self-important and self-absorbed, unwitty, unlikable.  (The amazing thing is that every character supposedly likes her.  Why?)  And in this one, there are TWO Susans--one named Cecile.  Cecile is not as disgusting as Susan, but that's only because she appears less.  Fortunately, at the end, she disappears entirely.  Would that the real Susan would go and do likewise. <br /> <br />(Note: this is not the worst Spenser.  That dishonor goes to \\"Double Deuce.\\"  But it's close.)	2005-07-06

It will make this one even more enjoyable. <br /> <br />In \\"Hope to Die,\\" Scudder left things unresolved--a baffling criminal gets away with it, and you're not sure just who he is until the end.  And even then, it is not fully clear. <br /> <br />This one, \\"All the Flowers Are Dying,\\" brings resolution. <br /> <br />It starts out as a minor, even trivial, job for Scudder: check out the questionable boyfriend of a friend.  But it quickly swerves into genius/serial killer mode. <br /> <br />The genius/serial killer is old hat, but amazingly Block makes it fresh, largely by playing off the killer's point of view against Scudder's. <br /> <br />In some ways this book recapitulates earlier Scudder mysteries (not just \\"Hope to Die\\"), and at one point it literally recapitulates. <br /> <br />But that is all to the good. <br /> <br />Emotionally involving, intellectually tense, very real-seeming--with all the old standby characters: Mick Ballou, TJ, Elaine, Joe Durkin, and more.	2005-05-19

I saw the plot coming from the first.    Still, it's exceptionally well written.  Like the best mystery writers (Robert Barnard, Dick Francis, Robert B. Parker), Crais depends more on character than plot.    His characters and quips sing.    Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are the greatest twosome since Huck and Jim.    And Crais handles well that perennial problem of the detective writer: What to Do with the Girlfriend?    Leslie Fiedler, in Love and Death in the American Novel, was right.  The classic American novels have no room for women.  They are boys' stories--usually tight tight sidekicks.    The same goes even more for detective stories, which are simply urban Westerns.    Crais does a great job of getting rid of Cole's girlfriend, and making you still care about him and her.    The best Cole book is still L.A. Requiem.  But this is a close second.    By the way, the set piece on Cole's experience in Viet Nam--A Bad Day at the Office--is spectacular.	2005-03-23

He's far too old (though quite humorous about it).    His values are stuck in the '40s.    His musical taste is stuck in the '30s.    His outlook is stuck in Tombstone in the 1890s.    But this is nothing.    The real problem with Spenser is SUSAN.  She has sucked from day one.  I don't know a Spenser reader (and I know many) who doesn't cringe at the mention of Susan.    I wonder if it would be possible to surgically remove all the Susan portions of the books and have them still make sense?  Probably an improvement.    There is really only one thing any future Spenser book can do to atone for all the annoying intrusions of Susan: shoot her.    Far from feeling grief or remorse, I predict Spenser will feel a jubilant sense of liberation.    Certainly his readers will.	2005-03-18

And this is the best of a very good lot.    The Elvis Cole books are better than the non-Cole books (Demolition Angel and Hostage--now a major crummy motion picture).    And one reason is Joe Pike.    Pike is a mythic creation: sort of like the Eastwoodian Strong Silent Type on steroids.    This book tells how Pike got that way.    It also has a very nice turn with Who Dun It.    Read all the Elvis Cole books, but if you can only read one, read this.	2005-03-17

I picked this 3-in-1 up because I had never read Pericles or the Two Noble Kinsmen. <br /> <br />I had seen a video of Pericles and liked it. <br /> <br />Reading it is equally fun.   <br /> <br />True, it's a mishmash, only three-fifths or so by Shakespeare; but it's great fun.  Incest!  Pirates!  Resurrection!  A Dea ex machina (Diana)!  Treachery!  Pimps!  Prostitutes!  True love!  Impossible reunions!  Transformed lives! <br /> <br />What more could you ask? <br /> <br />Cymbeline is also great; though less fun and darker.  Cloten and Iachimo are genuinely despicable; Imogen truly strong and wise.  Plus, the whole thing was written by Shakespeare, so there is the constant amazing poetry. <br /> <br />Still haven't read Two Noble Kinsmen (based on Chaucer). <br /> <br />The edition is very good in that it contains illuminating but not pedantic introductions, as well as excerpts from sources and essays variously helpful.	2005-02-02

The lesson was NOT \\"don't do it,\\" but \\"don't let them SEE you do it.\\" <br /> <br />Granted, Iraq is more dangerous now for reporters than Vietnam was (though Vietnam was no picnic).  But it's a shame there aren't more un-embedded reporters up to the task.  (There are a few, like Robert Fisk, in Iraq.) <br /> <br />A major reason Vietnam was brought to a close was the daily dinnertime TV news-images of napalmed babies, burned villages, dead soldiers.  The war in Iraq is more sanitized, so we won't revolt at the horror. <br /> <br />A sad, chilling, eye-opening, brilliantly-written book. <br /> <br />	2005-01-28

There are many many epiphanies made concrete, and her very simple but shattering verse actually takes you to them.<br /><br />This is a marvelously fluent poem.  Yes, there are allusions, but they are simple and bonus, rather than essential.<br /><br />It is one of those poems that is quite clear immediately, yet repays reading after reading.<br /><br />It's a pity so few current poets write with such depth and breadth--to say nothing of such passion.	2005-01-18

The biggest difference is that Lynley and Havers are missing. <br />  <br /> Instead she focuses on Simon and Deborah St. James. Others lament this fact, but I don't mind. I like Havers, but Lynley is a stick and his absence is no loss. <br />  <br /> I like the interplay between Deborah and Simon; and the setting--cold, rustic, damp, almost Druidical Guernsey--is gothic and interesting. <br />  <br /> A word about George's prose. Alas, poor thing, she needs an editor. She never uses one word when five will do worse.  <br />  <br /> Take this passage, for example, chosen almost at random (chapter 12): <br />  <br /> &quot;Despite the cold, no jacket protected him, just a faded blue work shirt on which someone had embroided Moullin Glass in red. The theme of climatic indifference was one that the man carried down to his feet, on which he wore sandals only, although he also had on socks. These however, displayed more than one hole and his right big toe protruded from one of them.&quot; <br />  <br /> Certainly those last 4 words should be cut. His &quot;right big toe protruded from one of them.&quot; And I bet I know which one, too. Or perhaps she meant to say, &quot;his right big toe protruded from one of them, as opposed to both, which would have been strange and difficult, unless he was wearing both socks on his right foot.&quot; <br />  <br /> This is mere sloppiness, the sign of a writer who favors quantity over quality. That's a verdict I am sure George would hate. <br />  <br /> Still, the setting, characters, and plot twists are fun.	2004-07-27

It retains Tyler's signature theme--families: you can't endure them and you can't escape them--but it does it in a more disjointed manner.<br />Tyler traces the 30 year course of a mismatched marriage, and then its breakup, and the aftershocks and ramifications.<br />Some have felt that Tyler leans too heavily in favor of Pauline, the free-spirit wife, and against Michael, the self-contained stoical husband.  But she treats them both fairly, probing the inner doubts and loves of each.<br />The point of view shifts from chapter to chapter, sometimes within the same chapter, so a different light is shed on events and so that characters can take full shape.<br />The shifts cause a sense of dislocation; but this is appropriate<BR>because the book is about the shocks, both inward and outward, that every family endures.<br />One lasting shock is how the two main characters--Pauline and Michael--end.  Miraculously, Tyler manages to convey a sense of terrible sadness and terrible elation all at once.<br />This is a marvelous book.  Any fan of Tyler will love it; and those who aren't fans are in for a widening of their horizons.	2004-04-22

Carville's gets very specific in his recommendations about what he is FOR (not just what he is against)--which is refreshing and helpful.<br />Franken's book is funnier and goes into more depth about the hypocrisy and mendacity and cruelty and elitism that are the Bush Administration.  That is, it's more about what he is against.<br />But who could reasonably NOT be against such things.  Even Bush pretends to be, which is why he has to lie so much.<br />Two of the very short chapters are brilliant and priceless.  Franken sent an Abstinence Endorsement letter out to the bigwigs in the Administration--Ashcroft, Rice, Wolfowitz, Cheney, Bush, etc.--and asked them to send back personal accounts of how they maintained sexual abstinence and how they profited by it.  None of them wrote back--presumably because they didn't practice it.<br />The other is \\"Supply Side Jesus,\\" which captures in nice, Chick Comic style, the hypocrisy of Bush's Pharisees, who believe that Jesus was for the rich and against everyone else.<br />A great and funny and illuminating book.<br />Franken is even honest enough to admit HE was deceived by Bush's lies about Iraq and at first supported the invasion.<br />This is his main point: Bush lies because lies work.	2004-02-11

I liked &quot;The Good Apprentice&quot; and &quot;Message to the Planet&quot; better.<br />&quot;The Sea, The Sea&quot; is earlier, and has more concrete elements--long scene-descriptions, heavy use of symbols--than these two later ones.  But in many respects it is the same.  It is what Hawthorne would call a romance: not a realistic novel but a kind of controlled experiment in which a set of characters is put in artificial circumstances and observed.<br />But in &quot;The Sea, The Sea,&quot; the cast of characters is smaller and not as interesting as in &quot;The Good Apprentice&quot; or &quot;Message to the Planet.&quot;  Also, in &quot;The Sea, The Sea,&quot; all characters are seen through the shifting lens of the narrator's (Charles Arrowby's) mind--which distorts and misperceives.<br />In some ways, &quot;The Sea, the Sea&quot; is like a giant footnote to Dickens.  In &quot;Little Dorrit,&quot; Arthur Clennam comes home after 20 years in China and finds that his boyhood love, Flora Finching, is now a widow and available.  He rejoices, but then finds that 20 years have made her into a COMPLETELY different person.  Arthur quickly gives up his youthful memories.<br />Not so Charles Arrowby of &quot;The Sea, The Sea,&quot; who holds them with the obsessive fanaticism of Ahab chasing the whale.<br />This obsession is sometimes interesting, but often exasperating.<br />&quot;The Sea, the Sea&quot; is a book about PARTIAL self-discovery.  Maybe there is no other kind; but Charles Arrowby's revelations are meager and annoyingly narcissistic.<br />The book is beautifully written--with Murdoch's characteristic explosion of adjectives--and her analysis sharp; but Hartley seems a feeble character to pin undying obsessions on: far less interesting and less admirable than Clennam's Flora Finching.	2003-12-20

Simple yet deep, elegant and unadorned, always fresh and looking at things objectively yet with deep feeling.<br />The book is always informative, engaging, and frequently hilarious.<br />One of the nicer things about the book is the inclusion of some letters from others.  Usually these are luminaries.  The one from Will Durant, together with Russell's curt rejoinder, is marvelous.  <br />Russell has the knack of taking what could become boastful incidents--his imprisonment for objecting to WWI, his hair-breadth escape when his plane went down near Norway in WWII--and turning them into humorous, self-effacing ones.<br />He also has the knack of talking about horrendous personal difficulties in a way that is objective and nonjudgmental.	2003-11-12

I have read it several times, and I still go back from time to time and re-read individual chapters.<br />This is a very human history of philosophy; you get a real sense of the times and concerns the philosophers faced.<br />In addition to an overview of Western philosophy, it also provides a fairly in-depth history of the West.  The chapters on individual philosophers are punctuated by ones dealing strictly with historical developments and trends.<br />Russell is famous for both his fairness and his outspokenness about his own views.  He does not always agree with certain philosophers, but he tries to present them fairly before stating his objections.  He is also fearless in presenting what he thinks is significant.  How many other books on philosophy present a chapter on Byron as philosopher/exemplar of the Romantic Rebel?<br />A side note.  In his autobiography, Russell tells about the composition of this History.  He wrote much of it during WWII while staying near Denver.  During very hot days he would retire to a little cottage and take off all his clothes.<br />The image of Russell composing this wonderful and insightful book mainly in the nude is quite delightful.	2003-11-12

This is an unusual scene for Tyler, but it quickly goes back to her usual territory: the maddening minutiae of everyday life.<br />As always the characters are quirky and fun.<br />The chapters alternate between the present and the past, so all the elements of the picture gradually come together.<br />It isn't really a love story; but none of Tyler's books are love stories--unless you count, being in love with being.<br />To anyone who hasn't tried Tyler, I would recommend this book.  It avoids the schmaltziness of &quot;Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant&quot; and even &quot;Accidental Tourist.&quot;	2003-05-14

Second, her unwavering contention that all war is essentially a war of the rich against the poor.<br />She is biting and humorous and absolutely indignant at the misinformation and disinformation people in the US are fed to justify the US corporate takeover of the world--with the aid and support of almost every government, bought and bribed and stolen.	2003-04-21

This is a book of essays written over the last ten years.<br />The lead essay, about 9/11, has stunning info.  <br />First, Vidal alleges (and I agree with him) that Bush and Co. were planning to invade Afghanistan long before 9/11--to topple the Taliban and hence expedite the Unocal pipeline.  The Taliban and bin Laden got wind of this (the invasion was supposed to start in October 2001), and ordered the 9/11 attacks to derail it.  (It had the opposite effect, obviously.)<br />Second, many in the US military were stunned at the complete absence of interceptors to head off the 9/11 attacks.  Military protocol states that when an airliner veers off course, Air Force jets are supposed to go up immediately and see why.  This did not happen on 9/11 even though the airliners were tracked every step of the way; it did not happen even after they started crashing into buildings.  Vidal suggests they may have been held back in order for the disaster to go forward--and provide Bush an excuse for the Afghanistan war and all subsequent crackdowns and all subsequent wars.<br />Also, the book closes with a wonderful interview with Vidal.  He explains the origins of terrorism, both homegrown and foreign, quite clearly.	2003-02-12

His 1890s Baja California is a microcosm of race and class and climate and culture.  It is a love story, but like all good love stories it puts you there and makes you feel how love is: like hypnosis, like drugs.<br />As always, Thomson's prose is iridescent.  Things jump into life in his prose.  Also as always, he treats the dark and harsh things of life with loving detail and great humor.	2003-01-31

When you read this book of essays, you will see why.<br />It is beautifully written and has all of Russell's virtues: clarity, wit, humor, forcefulness, simplicity.<br />Even better, it is a brief education in itself.  Most of the essays were written just as the Great Depression was beginning, and Russell gets right to the heart of a problem Capitalists and Socialists do not usually address: How much work is needed, and what is the ultimate point?  He constantly stresses that we do too much work, and most of it is unneeded, and makes life grim.  He never ceases to remind us that we should work to live, not live to work.<br />He addresses this point in many ways--through economics, through architecture, through the then-raging problems of Fascism and Communism.  And though he treats serious problems seriously, he always has time for the breathtaking perspective and the ligtht touch--as with the essay, &quot;Man Versus Insects.&quot;<br />A wonderful, even life-changing book.	2003-01-16
US	46415742	R1KHXNO29J8ZTZ	0451525264	996904481	Les Miserables	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Simply Smashing	It IS daunting to pick up a book of 1,470 pages of close print.<br />But it is worth it.  Keep plugging away.  It's great!  Each character is beautifully detailed, and although the events are melodramatic, the characters are psychologically complex and deep.<br />I even like all the background detail.  Hugo spends an entire &quot;book&quot;--major section of one of the five parts--on the Battle of Waterloo.  I personally find military history pointless and boring; but this comes alive and is wonderful for all of his trenchant observations on human affairs and politics.<br />All in all a great book, and a fun-to-read education.<br />The translation is remarkably modern and easy.	2002-11-20
