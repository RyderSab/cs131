She'd been given the book when she had lost one of her babies.  I read it and cried - at that time we had just put down our little girl Sponge.  It just gave me a little more peace that our little baby was no longer in pain and having all the biscuits she could eat and with her other family members that had passed on.  The first line in the book \\"When dogs go to heaven, they don't need wings because God knows that dogs love running best.\\" That was our Sponge.  Hard to believe a kid's book could have such an affect on a person. <br /> <br />Sponge's sister Scotch is now 18 and she's getting up in years - walking slower, cataracts, you fellow dog parents know the routine.  I finally broke down and got my own copy of the book.  None of us ever know how long we'll be here, but this book is such a comfort to those of us with pets that our pets are not forgotten.  For those cat lovers, the author has also written Cat Heaven.  If it's anything like this book, another joy to have and I'll probably end up getting it even though I'm a dog Mom. <br /> <br />I have to thank the author for putting into words and images how so many of us feel about our 'kids'.  You won't be sorry you got this book :). <br /> <br />I would also highly recommend 'For Every Dog An Angel' by Christine Davis - another wonderful book. <br /> <br />	2005-10-07

He was the only one our 'daughter' didn't lunge at, just growled at.  She was used to being the boss and we had just put her sister to sleep recently.  Three days after we adopted our son, the two were inseparable. <br /> <br />Believe me, strays definitely show how grateful they are for the second chance they've been given.  The stories in this book show that.  Sometimes it seems the people are the ones who need saving.  If someone ever wanted to know how much saving a dog (or any other animal stray) can make a difference, READ this book. The story in the introduction is just wonderful.  You won't be sorry and this family gives it 2 paws up :)	2005-10-02

This little reference is excellent.  Great that it just happened to be written on the version I'm using now - 7.4.  The book however is based on TOAD's core functionality and not really so much on new features.  Just skimming through I came across some features I hadn't even used.<br />It's does touch on the optional add-ins you can get for TOAD (if you get the commericial version) like the DBA module.  It had plenty for me on the debugger.  If you're looking for a tutorial, this isn't it, though it does remind you about looking in the docs folder for TOAD documentation in PDF.   This little guide is a great reference.	2004-03-02

I already had Jennifer Berman's 'Why Dogs Are Better Than Men' and when I saw this one, I had to get it.  This book had me laughing so hard.  She's very impartial like her last book. The book is divided into 3 parts -  1. Why Dogs Are Better Than Kids  2.  Why Kids Are Better Than Dogs and 3. How Dogs and Kids Are The Same.  We've got our dogs and in reading this book, I just kept looking at them and saying 'Exactly!'.<br />If you've got four-footed kids or want to know why there are those of us with four-footed kids, you have to pick up this book.  Amazon has this book under their Search Inside feature - take a look.  You'll be glad you did :)	2004-01-11

It was great finding things I had (and kicking myself for things I wish I still had :) ).  When I started to wonder if there was a Star Wars _____, I'd look through the book and there it was!  There are definitely thousands of pictures - problem is they're tiny.  If you don't have the greatest vision, a magnifying glass would help.    I did also find some typos between what was identified in the picture and the id description (I'd seen the item before so I could tell the description was wrong).  If you're looking for information on the trading cards, this is the right place.  I'd say probably at least 1/4 of the book is nothing but trading card information.    For the price and what the book was trying to accomplish (categorize just about any known Star Wars item on earth), it's well worth the price.  It brought back some great memories too so I think it's still a great buy.	2004-01-07

I had seen an ad about this book with some of the remedies listed.  I went and bought it just to see what I could find in there.  As I started reading it, I saw ones my MOM used.      Say you're cooking and some grease gets on you, try Colgate toothpaste(regular).  Canada Dry Ginger Ale is great for upset stomach (generic brand works just as well) for clearing up congestion.  There were quite a few old family remedies in this book that I've used before.  The author also lists interesting facts about the companies whose products he lists.  He also explains in many of the remedies why they work.    The book is really helpful, but don't feel you can only use the brand names he lists.  For example, the one about using Canada Dry Ginger Ale - I've used generic brands for years and you will get the same result. The Colgate one - I've used gel types and that works too.  I'll probably be going through this book again and again.  It's a nice reference for the price :)    I recently picked up another copy for a relative.  Her kids found the book and SHE didn't see it again for a week.  I didn't realize the kids would be so fascinated with the book.  It's really a great way to have kids explore how things work. Again, a great reference.	2003-11-08

There aren't alot of puertorican restaurants here, one cuban restaurant that I know of.  I picked up the book and just reading about the spices used helped me figure out what I was missing when cooking some of my Mom's recipes.<br />There are recipes that call for frying, that's true but as the author states, the idea is cook on very high heat and not to cook too much at once - for me having a deep fryer works great for the recipes that call for it. <br />I've gone through some of the recipes so far and I haven't been disappointed yet. I've either taken them directly as stated adn/or compared them to my recipes to see what I might be missing.<br />For those looking to make pasteles, this book even has a diagram on how to wrap them up.  Just seeing the recipe for pasteles had my eyes lit up.  If you think making tamales is a project, try making a pasteles :-)<br />This book is definitely worth the price and if he makes another edition, I'll buy it :-)	2003-06-02

Leia and Han have only been married for 6 months in this story..As far as I can tell, this is probably right after &quot;The Courtship of Princess Leia&quot;.  They're on Tantooine to recover a painting which if the Empire gets it, will spell doom for rebel agents that are within the Empire.<br />Leia is given a a journal.   The journal opens her eyes to the kind of person her father was growing up.  I thought this was really neat, but I had to start wondering about how this book might be out of sync with other books.  I just started reading the Black Fleet Crisis now, cause I'm wondering about Luke finding his mother's people may have problems with this book.<br />The plot to get the painting back was interesting, but the portions of the book where Leia was reading the journal had me glued.  The chases and such were to me just not keeping me entertained.	2003-05-05

I'd heard from a friend that Sam's Teach Yourself books were really good.  I've been using Unix for over 10 years, so I was curious to see what this book could show a beginner in '10 minutes'.  I will say the lessons are intended to be short so you don't end up getting bored.  The explanations are good, giving enough detail so you find out what you need to know.<br />I was glad to see the book mentions how not to get frustrated if a particular command doesn't exactly work as you see in the book.  There are many flavors of Unix nowadays so it's very possible each version may have the command that's being talked about but it may be just a bit different.<br />I found a couple of commands that I hadn't heard of before (pushd and popd) so this old girl learned something too :-).  I didn't give the book 5 stars because of its section on the editors available in Unix.  The section on vi needed to show a few more basic commands plus maybe one or two tips.  The vi editor can be hard for some because due to the structure of the commands.<br />Overall, the book gives a newbie good information to get their feet wet.  Once a newbie gets going and wants to dig in to Unix some more, I highly recommend the OReilly &quot;Unix In A Nutshell&quot; book.  Once you get the feel of how Unix is structured, using the Nutshell book will make more sense.	2003-03-29

I've used them for years and haven't found a bad one yet. The books are meant for users to find 'how do I ....' and get you right down to it.<br />The book is very well laid out giving descriptions of commands and shells as well as chapters on text editing/processing(emacs, vi, sed, etc), text formatting (nroff) and software development (sccs, make).  It's not exactly meant as a 'lead the hand' reference if you're just starting to learn Unix.  I say for that first try O'Reilly's 'Learning the Unix Operating System'.  <br />Once you begin to understand how Unix is put together, Unix In A Nutshell will definitely make more sense to you. For someone who has used Unix for years, I've used this book over and over for just about any flavor of Unix I've come across.  I have yet to find a command that I needed that WASN'T in this book.  I even recommended this and 'Learning the Unix Operating System' to my husband who wants to learn Unix.  This book is well worth the price for the amount of information you get.	2003-03-12

This book has been updated to include characters from Attack of the Clones as well as the New Jedi Order Series.  The art is awesome and was great to get a refresher from Star Wars novels I've read in the past.  There are spoilers from Attack of the Clones, so if you haven't read the book or seen the movie yet, you may want to hold off on reading this book first ;-).

After reading it, the book makes one more aware of what to be careful when giving out information of any kind and how to protect yourself and your company's assets.  I've heard alot of &quot;Don't ever give out your id/password&quot;, &quot;Always have firewalls on your network.&quot;  One hardly ever hears about 'make sure you're giving information to someone who's supposed to have it'.  There's tons of books on security with respect to technology but this is the first one I've seen that actually focuses on the weakest link when it comes to security - the human element.<br />All the firewalls and software can't prevent a social engineer from getting in if he/she knows justs how to act and/or what to say to get what they want.  Reading the scenarios really opened my eyes.  Theres a scenario where a social engineer pretended to be a manager of a video store.  After enough talking to another employee at another branch, the social engineer was able to get enough information to obtain the credit card # of someone who owed money to the client the social engineer was hired by.<br />In reading the scenarios, I'd seen examples where I'd asked for the type of information described for perfectly legitimate reasons. I'd never imagined how someone could take just 1 or 2 pieces of information and create chaos for a person or a company. If you're in the IT industry, or work in any kind of customer service, you really need to pick up this book. This book doesn't bash people for being as helpful as they can be (team player, etc).  He's just saying to be more aware of what's going on and when giving out any kind of information, being a little cautious doesn't hurt.  As humans, we're not perfect to begin with, but a little awareness will make it just a little harder for that social engineer to get what they want.	2002-11-17

I'm among those who do know what kind of responsibility it takes to own a dog.  I'm the happy 'Mom' of 2 terriers, one of which is a rescue dog.  It is true about rescued animals - they know they've been given another chance and will give you their love many times over.<br />Elizabeth Hess was down to earth in showing the trials and successes an animal shelter goes through.  If you know someone who's not sure about getting a pet, I highly suggest they read this book.  It'll make them think twice.  If you know someone with misconceptions that all shelter animals get homes, give them this book as a wakeup call! A pet can take up as much or more of your time than a human baby, but the human race has made dogs, cats and other animals disposeable.  There are happy endings as well as sad in the book, but it's worth buying.  As the kids would say, we give it a 2 paws up!	2002-10-29

I've used Unix for years and it was nice to find this little reference.  It's laid out by logical categories which makes finding the commands easy.  I should say first 'easy' meaning you've used vi before, just need to lookup the syntax of a command.  The last page shows you how to get information on the other vi type editors.  I can tell you for sure elvis and vim are open source, which means FREE :-).<br />If you're a total newbie to vi and Unix, I'd suggest the Unix in a Nutshell book.  If you just need vi, try Learning the vi Editor.  Then the pocket reference can be for quick lookups. The O'Reilly books are great for the 'how do i do ???'.  I've used the Nutshell books for years and haven't found a bad one yet.<br />The only reason I couldn't give this 5 stars was the price - [$] for about 66 pages seems a bit much.  I just like having this small reference than having to drag my Unix In A Nutshell book around with me.	2002-10-27

The pictures are black and white but are very well done.  The photographer really shows the bond between owner and pet. There are some celebrities posing with 'borrowed' pets but the animals look to be enjoying it just the same. In looking through the book there were celebrities like Paul Stanley, Ozzy Ossbourne and Ice-T.  <br />As a dog lover I just couldn't pass this book up.  One of our kids is a rescued shelter dog so I know the joy these animals give back for being given a second chance.

He is right, carbs are an addiction. That lightheadedness you may feel - hello? can we say withdrawl symptoms??  I didn't realize how much I craved them till my husband and I tried the diet. It was working as promised - 4 days I lost 4 pounds, I was hardly tired but the first phase called Induction where you basically start with at most 20g of carbs a day was really hard.  <br />No, you don't starve on this diet despite what some have said (I think it's because some readers didn't read the whole book before going on the diet).  You can have meat, eggs, cheese, veggies (only certain ones at the beginning mind you) among other things along with drinking plenty of water and taking vitamins.  After about 4 days I had to stop - I wasn't sick or anything, just tired of the same set of food over and over.  Not having toast with my eggs and bacon was driving me nuts! The salad was fine but I couldn't have my favorite dressing cause it had too many carbs in it.  To those that have gotten through this diet I applaud you - how one can give up as many carbs as one does in the beginning until you build your carb intake back up does take time and work.<br />Despite not completing the diet, it really did me alot of good.  Having that brief period of 'going cold turkey' on carbs, it helped me to see I don't have to have them all the time and can enjoy other things, just in moderation more than I was doing before.  I've started more exercise.  I used to want to take a sweet snack to work everyday, now it's no big deal.  Instead of chocolate, jello works; instead of a can of soda, club soda with lemon juice tastes great.  Even if you don't end up completing the diet, the wealth of information Dr. Atkins provides about why americans are so chained to their carbs is very enlightening.<BR>It's helped me change my eating habits and for the amount of health informationhe provides, it's worth the price.	2002-04-01

It started along ok but the further I got into it the worst it got. The concepts about PFC were fine but using the exercises were a mess. There was an exercise that was telling the reader to change a datawindow but that window would't get used because the menu was calling some other window. It wasn't just mis-spellings but at times the instructions were just wrong. One exercise towards the end wouldn't work because the PBL wouldn't compile. You had to actually edit one of the object's source code to get it to work, which you shouldn't have to do. I am a PB newbie but this book was run through several coworkers, including an experienced PowerBuilder programmer and they all had troubles. It went a little easier for them since I wrote notes in the book about what was wrong. I also emailed the author about the mistakes and he said a free copy of the next version would be coming (that was Dec 2001 and now almost April 2002).

For those of us who believe there's a place for everyone when your time comes(human and animal), the book really brings this out.  Adults as well as kids will enjoy the book.	2002-01-04

Wow - talk about excellent guide. The introductory chapters on homeopathy are excellent. <br />The real help came when my same baby started having serious liver problems and I didn't know why. With an ALT of over 500, it wasn't looking good. I wasn't comfortable with giving her the special dog food containing Ethoxyquin(pesticide in dog food?? - don't think so). The book recommended Milk Thistle. After talking to the vet, my husband and I began a natural diet and milk thistle immediately. Within a month the ALT was down and in another 2 weeks she was back to normal. Mind you, my little girl is 14 so I can say this book has been a lifesaver. This book along with consulting your vet is definitely worthwhile. You can't go wrong getting this book for your furry friends.<br />It's now April 2003 and now she has a bad heart murmur.  After consulting the book and doing more research, found that CoQ10 has been very helpful in alleviating (and in some cases reversing) heart disease in humans.  I've given her 1 10Mg CoQ10 tablet a day and after a week, she is showing improvement.  One sign of a heart murmur is a hacking cough.  Her coughs are not as frequent now.  This book was certainly worth buying :-).	2002-01-04

As soon as I opened the book, I couldn't put it down.  The stories will make you laugh and cry.  I can't tell you how many times I've re-read it - it's just that good.  If there's a skeptic out there who thinks dogs have no feelings, check this book out - it'll prove you wrong	2002-01-04

It took me down the concepts step by step and has been an excellent reference.  This book did hand-holding, which for someone who was using PB for the first time, was a great help.  The price may seem alot but you get the exercises on disk with the solutions.  For those IT people who don't have time to go to a class outside work and spend big $$$ this book is definitely worth it. You won't be sorry you bought it.  The next logical step is to get her Advanced PowerBuilder 7 book!	2001-12-28

It's set up in a university classroom setting where his students get to do a real world project for a china shop owner (really modifications to an existing program).  The original program is first introduced in the Intro book, but you can go to the publisher's website to download the project as it stood in the Intro book. I have done database programming for years, but was looking for using VB 6 with Databases.  It was very informative but I can't rate it 5 stars like his other books because I felt there wasn't enough coverage of DAO and hardly any about ADO.  As for using Access, it will give you just enough to use Access for simple table creation and such. If you're looking for heavy duty use between Access and VB, this book isn't for you.  If you are looking to be led by the hand for introductory Visual Basic with Databases, by all means get this book.  For the ADO and DAO, use the O'Reilly nutshell books - they're excellent.	2001-12-09

I had read his previous book &quot;Learn To Program With Visual Basic&quot; and found his writing style very unique.  It was great to find out he wrote one on VB Objects.  I'm halfway through the book and he's made VB Objects easy to understand.<br />For those of you who may not have read his other books before, you're reading the book as if you're in a University class setting taking his VB Objects class.  Yes, there's alot of dialogue between him and his students (remember, it's a classroom setting) which can get boring at first.  What may seem boring is really his way of pounding those concepts into you. He uses his China Shop program from his first book to guide his students into making it object-oriented.  The examples really help explain the concepts.<br />I've gotten to the Chapter on Class Modules.  This is the only book I've found that explained this concept to me in a way that made sense without so much mumbojumbo.  I've been programming for years, wanted to really learn Visual Basic but got tired of the same old reference book style. Other books assume you always have some knowledge level of the subject itself. This one only assumes you've had introductory VB experience NOT Objects.  You will find out that if you've used VB before, you've had experience with Objects :-) .<br />I'm using this book in VB Object class at an online learning site(Actually, I was already getting this book after I finished Prof Smiley's first book) and it's working great. If you want a simple way to understand objects, get this book.  If you're the type that needs to be 'led by the hand' on Objects, this book is for you.	2001-07-21

I've picked up VB here and there wanted someway to learn the old fashion way - from the ground up.  The book is set up as if you're in a college class taking an Intro to Visual Basic and knowing NOTHING of programming.  I've been programming for years and found this to be what I was looking for as a unique approach.  <br />There are 'comments' made by classmates and you are taken through building a working Visual Basic program.  For those who have NEVER done programming, this book is the way to take out any intimidation you may have.  It comes with VB6 Working Model Edition so you don't have to spend hundreds on software to get going.  Also for those who may tinkered in VB, this book explained some things I didn't understand before.<br />I happen to be using this book as a textbook in an Intro to Visual Basic class with Prof. Smiley HIMSELF, but what I NEED to get out of the course IS in his book. So far if I started to have a question, I just keep reading a little further and my question is answered.  Prof Smiley can't answer every question I have with 70+ people in the class.  Note: THIS IS NOT A VB REFERENCE. This book is intended as a self-study course.  If you're looking for a quick reference guide to accompany this great book, check out Visual Basic 6 Visual Quickstart Guide by Peachpit Press.	2001-03-25

I had read Yourdon's works in college and the title just caught my eye.  Well, here it is folks - the year 2000 and some things just don't change.  For those of you who have ever been on a death march project, it may have you saying &quot;Has Yourdon been spying on ME at the office? :).  It's good to know someone else can relate to what we software development folks go through when we're drafted into one of those blasted things. It's got the humor and important points all in the right mix.  This is a must have!	2000-10-07

I've used the Pill Book for years, and when I saw the version for Dogs and Cats, I was thrilled.  Just like us, all dogs don't react the same way to medications.  It's helped me keep track of what our dogs can and can't  take. This book DOESN'T replace the vet, but it sure does help you know  what you should be asking when you're talking to the vet!  Next edition  please!	1999-12-18
