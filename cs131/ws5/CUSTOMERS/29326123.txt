He leaves his father to become a samana - basically itinerary ascetics. His friend and follower, Govinda, joins him in his journey. Siddhartha tries to free himself from his ego. One day, he meets Sukyamuni, the Perfect One, the Buddha. He exchanges a few words with him and feels a soaring love for this Perfect One. The Perfect One enlightens him, although Siddhartha feels he does not want to listen to Teachings anymore. His friend, Govinda, decides to become one of the Buddha's disciples, and so Siddhartha is now alone in finishing his quest for Peace and Truth. At this stage of his life, he pursues the worldly pleasures that he has for so long denied himself. He meets a beautiful woman Komala, the great merchandiser Kamiswami, and many others that aid him in flattering and enjoying his senses. Komala teaches him about the love of a woman, Kamiswami teaches him about business. Soon, Siddhartha indulges himself with fine garments and sates his hunger with delicious foods.<br /><br />Then, days find Siddhartha with a sense of disgust, shame, and the feeling that he has lead a senseless, meaningless life by indulging himself with worldly pleasures. Here, the powerful climax of Siddhartha emerges as Siddhartha continues, once more, his quest for Peace, Truth, and Spirituality.<br /><br />The profundity of this book, the beautiful, powerful words, the imagery it conjures up, the eloquence in which everything is conveyed - it was delightfully amazing. It really made me think about life from a totally different perspective, which was different but also wonderfully refreshing. I can tell that Siddhartha will be a memorable novel for me. Years from now, I will think back to reading this book and how it made me feel.<br /><br />Siddhartha is an intelligent, profound, and ultimately wise book. This is a must-read for anyone who is interested in Buddhism or spirtitualism or just philosophy. This book may be small, but don't underestimate it because of its size - it holds more power and meaning than most thick books do.ll, but don't underestimate it because of its size - it holds more power and meaning than most thick books do.  <br />	2005-09-11

Nina is off to a college program for the summer, and Mel and Avery work at P.J. Mortimer's as waitresses. Then, one day, Mel and Avery kiss, which complicates their relationship. They soon start \\"dating\\" and it is evident they are in love with each other. When Nina finds out, she is shocked, and she feels their friendship will no longer be the same. <br /> <br />The Bermudez Triange takes us on a journey of heartbreak, loss, identity, friendship, and love. Nina, Mel, and Avery all have their fair share of problems, but their bond is enough to bring them together and help each other out. Other characters come into play as well, including Steve Carson, Nina's environmentalist boyfriend whom she meets at her summer program, and Parker, a waiter who works at P.J. Mortimers but who soon becomes involved in the girls' friendship. <br /> <br />Maureen Johnson has done an excellent job with this novel. Not only is it an engaging page-turner, but The Bermudez Triangle makes readers sympathize and care for the characters. I felt I grew very close to each of the best friends, especially Nina. Sometimes the subject of sexual identity and homosexuality are written about so much that the topic starts to become tedious. But Maureen Johnson is not one of those tedious authors; she brings a fresh voice to the YA scene and approaches the subject of sexual identity in a sophisticated and mature way. <br /> <br />The Bermudez Triangle is a pleasure to read. I found I couldn't stop turning the pages - the plot just flowed so nicely and the characters were so interesting. The Bermudez Triangle is definitely one of the finer YA novels out there. <br /> <br />I also recommend Maureen Johnson's other book, The Key to the Golden Firebird.	2005-09-02

Sophie's World is an unforgettable novel that deals with the history of philosophy, but is also ultimately a mystery with a fantastic twist. <br /> <br />When characters first start reading Sophie's World, they are introduced to Sophie Amundsen, a fourteen year old girl. She discovers two questions in her mailbox:  <br />Who are you, and Where does the world come from? <br /> <br />From those two letters emerge a whole lot of other thought-provoking, philosophical questions and Sophie is drawn into a philosophy course. Whoever is sending her these questions later teaches her about the earliest philosophers, starting with the natural philosophers and progressing to the classical philosophers, and more. <br /> <br />The revelation of who Sophie's mysterious philosophy teacher is a pivotal point in the story, and brings a new world and perspective to the reader. <br /> <br />Gaarder has done a magnificent job crafting this brilliantly-written novel. It is like no other - this book is not only entertaining and engaging, but it is educational as well. Sophie's World would be an excellent book for those who wish to learn about the basics of philosophy (the concepts are basic and pretty brief, but you get the gist of it). Although I had a bit of background knowledge on some of the philosophers that were talked about in this book, I definitely learned a lot I didn't know; the concepts are interesting and thought-provoking. This book is not only limited to those who want to learn more about philosophy, though - I would recommend Sophie's World to anyone looking for a fabulous, interesting book that compels you to read on from page one.	2005-08-29

Furthermore, her boyfriend, Greg, has also gone away for the summer. Shelby feels lonely and isn't sure what she's going to do to occupy herself. <br />Then Shelby discovers that an old man she knows vaguely, Mr. Stanley, has been injured and taken to the hospital. She goes over there and visits him, and soon enough, Shelby has taken Mr. Stanley's cat, Ernie, to care of while he's recuperating.<BR>Ernie proves to be a bit of a spoiled, misbehaved cat, but with time, Shelby can't help but grow affectionate towards the little scoundrel. <BR>The tending of Ernie is a pleasant backdrop to this exciting mystery.<br />Shelby suddenly discovers that her best friend, Betts, and her family are not, in fact, out of town on vacation. It turns out that Betts' mom has been accused of stealing an important computer program from NUTEC, her place of work. <BR>In hopes of exonerating Betts' mom, Shelby gets a job at NUTEC as a student worker and tries to investigate who could have taken the computer program. Things don't look good, however, because all of the evidence seems to be pointing to Betts' mom, and all the while, Shelby keeps having to remind herself that her best friend's mom is innocent.<br />The eventual conclusion to this curious mystery is a clever, smart, and utterly satisfying one. As proven in Valerie Sherrard's previous Shelby Belgarden mysteries, Shelby is a young but precocious detective. <br />Other points of interest in Hiding in Plain Sight include the gossip of the office people that Shelby works with, and Shelby's deepening relationship with her boyfriend, Greg. Shelby is a very real character, and her thoughts and feelings are those that probably every teenager experiences at one time or another. Fans who have kept up with Valerie Sherrard's Shelby Belgarden mysteries will probably notice thatShelby is becoming more mature, and she has definitely honed some amazing detective skills! <br />All in all, Hiding in Plain Sight is an excellent and suspenseful addition to the well-liked and admired Shelby Belgarden mysteries. I can hardly wait for the next Shelby Belgarden mystery to come out! I highly recommend this novel, especially to fans of Valerie's previous Shelby Belgarden mysteries.	2005-08-22

I recommended it in the first place, already having read Mrs. Sherrard's Shelby Belgarden mysteries (which I loved). <br />It was a quick and wonderful read. I found that when I was reading, it became increasingly harder to put it down. I'd even neglect my homework to continue reading it. <br />Kate is so real - and incredibly brave. She was fourteen, and she was dying. Having someone so young, under the worst circumstances, being so optimistic about life was just incredible. I also enjoyed reading about her life - her parents, her falling-out with her best friend Josie, the town recluse (whom Kate befriends), and who could forget Randy, Kate's love interest. Everything tied in together nicely, and I liked the diary first-person format. It made everything that much more personal and real. <br />The other members of the book club also enjoyed the book. We all thought Kate was admirable - someone to be highly commended for her bravery, strength, and overall optimism of life, even though she was dying. <br />However, the book was very sad and heart-wrenching at times. I shed a few tears at the end - so be sure to keep a box of tissues nearby! <br />Thank you, Mrs. Sherrard, for writing such a poignant and wonderful story. <br />Kate was a fantastic read. Highly recommended.	2005-08-22

It explores the life of Paul McDaniel, who has a brother, Shawn, who is a vegetable (brain-damaged). Paul is an angry, violent boy who resents his father for walking out on them - leaving them all, but especially leaving Shawn. <br /> <br />But Paul is also a talented basketball player and student. He is the captain of the basketball team, and sometimes, when he feels especially angry, he thinks it's cathartic to let out his energy and anger out on the basketball court.  <br /> <br />The manner in which Paul describes his brother Shawn is heart-wrenching, especially the \\"Aaaahhh\\" sound Shawn always makes. Paul knows he loves his brother, but he expresses how frustrating it is to live with his vegetable brother sometimes, and he even wonders what the point of Shawn's life is. Another main conflict that Paul has is with his father, who he truly detests; he thinks his father is a coward for running out of his family, running out on his brain-damaged son. But the fact that his father wrote a poem about Shawn and won a Pulitzer Prize for it, almost like he's using Shawn for his own success, infuriates Paul. <br /> <br />Cruise Control explores Paul's troubling life. This novel is not just another teen novel - it is one that is hard and raw and serious. Trueman has done an excellent job of writing in the eyes of a teenage boy - the thoughts, the words, the slang, are all very authentic and real. Furthermore, this book tackles a subject few YA books have done before: living and dealing with a vegetable for a brother. There is nothing unrealistic or facetious about this experience, written convincingly in Paul's eyes.  <br /> <br />Cruise Control is a brilliant and triumphant companion to Stuck in Neutral, which was written in Shawn's eyes. Trueman has done a fine job with both of these books. You do not, however, need to read Stuck in Neutral to understand Cruise Control. Each book is independent on its own, but I read Stuckin Neutral first and thought it helped me become more familiar with the characters. Stuck in Neutral also offers an interesting perspective in the eyes of a brain-damaged boy. <br /> <br />In any case, I highly recommend Cruise Control. It is a short but satisfying read, and I guarantee you will fly though it.  <br />	2005-08-19

Buck.<br /><br />And wow, I have to say I'm amazed. This book blew me away. I loved the plot - it was so intriguing. The beginning of the book is misleading, as I felt it was a bit boring and going a bit slow. But during the middle and end, the book definitely reaches its zenith, and I was utterly compelled to keep reading.<br /><br />Wang Lung is a poor Chinese farmer. In the beginning of the book, he wakes up to his marriage day. On this day, he goes to the great House of Hwang and gets a kitchen slave as his wife. O-lan, his wife, is a plain woman whose feet are unbound. She is not pretty, but she bears for Wang Lung many children. She also takes care of him, and all the while Wang Lung continually underappreciates her. She is like a shadow in the background - only being used for Wang Lung's pleasure, for bearing him children, and for cooking and cleaning. A turn of events finds Wang Lung rich and prosperous, and when this happens, Wang Lung grows insouciant and haughty. Silver trickles out of his hands like water as he squanders his money on everything and anything. When he grows lustful, he goes to a tea shop, and soon there, he finds a beautiful, petite woman to pleasure himself with. As Wang Lung grows more and more prosperous, his personality changes more and more, and at times it seems like every vestige of the poor country farmer that Wang Lung once was, is gone.<br /><br />I think The Good Earth ultimately explores human nature - especially avarice, lust, and depravity. It illustrates the destiny of man through the farmer Wang Lung. Pearl S. Buck wrote The Good Earth eloquently and beautifully. She writes in a way so that you care for the characters, that you sympathize with them.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading about Wang Lung and all of his experiences - the good and the bad. It is no surprise to me now why The Good Earth won the Pulitzer Prize in the 1930s, and why Pearl S. Buck is a Nobel-prize winning author. I know that she was a daughter of a missionary in China, but even writing as a white woman, she transcends the difference in culture and writes confidently and accurately about China and Chinese customs.<br /><br />I highly commend her for doing this, and am adding The Good Earth to my list of favourite books.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Good Earth. It is a book that I underestimated at first, because of the beginning, but I stuck with it and it was definitely worth it in the end. Not only does The Good Earth explore the Chinese culture, but its message is one that is universal to everyone.winning author.

It was so beautiful and compelling that I could hardly bear to put it down to finish the next day.<br />All That Matters is the long and eagerly awaited sequel to Choy's first book, the award-winning and national best-selling The Jade Peony. Expectedly, it is a continuation of Jade Peony, this time written in First Son Kiam Kim's eyes, instead of the rotating narrators (which included all of the siblings of the Chen family) found in The Jade Peony. <br />All That Matters is very reminiscent of The Jade Peony - it is almost like an echo of Choy's first book. The book focuses centrally on Kiam Kim, from when he first boards the Hong Kong ship to Gold Mountain (Vancouver, B.C.) to his adulthood in Vancouver's Chinatown. Kiam Kim's Poh Poh is another important part of the story, with her Old China and superstitious ways. She tells stories about ancient myths and ghosts, of which make Kiam Kim feel torn - in some instances, he believes in the things Poh Poh tells him, but his father is constantly reminding him that they are in Gold Mountain, not Old China, and to adapt essentially to &quot;modern, scientific, Canadian ways.&quot; <br />Kiam Kim's responsibility as &quot;First Son&quot; and &quot;Dai-Goh (Oldest Brother)&quot; sometimes burdens him, but he soon learns that this is the Chinese way - as the First Son and the oldest sibling, he needs to be a good role-model for the rest of the family and, ultimately, refrain from &quot;shaming&quot; the family in any way. He is best friends with Jack O'Connor, an Irish white boy who is his next-door neighbour. A somewhat clandestine but intimate relationship between Kiam Kim and Jenny Chong (the daughter of one of Poh Poh's mah-jong mates) forms. All That Matters also deals with the second World War, of which readers will see makes a significant impact on Kiam Kim and the rest of the characters in the book. <br />All in all, All That Matters isa satisfying, triumphant sequel to The Jade Peony - and rightfully so that it was long and eagerly awaited. Choy does not disappoint in this sequel to his first book. In fact, he writes hauntingly and seductively, often incorporating Chinese phrases uttered by Poh Poh and other members of his family to make things more homely and authentic. Readers will be compelled by this wonderful book, entering the world of Kiam Kim - his trials and tribulations, his responsibilities and burdens, his relationships and family, and, ultimately, what matters.<br />For fans of The Jade Peony, I highly urge you to pick up All That Matters and to read it. I guarantee you will like it as much, if not more, than The Jade Peony. It is no surprise why All That Matters won the Trillium Award again, not to mention was also a finalist for the Giller Prize. <br />Having met Wayson Choy at an author reading in December made reading All That Matters for me that much more exciting and thrilling. I felt like I shared an affinity with various characters in the book and, at times, with Wayson Choy. I am certainly looking forward to reading more work by Wayson Choy.<br />I highly recommend All That Matters.	2005-07-29

But that's alright - Fang's sweetness and his obvious care and concern for Emily compensates.   <br /> <br />I hope Ms. Maxwell will continue the Emily series. They're great books if you're looking for something light and quick, and they never fail to make you smile or laugh at Emily's antics. I can't wait to read the next one; hopefully Fang will have recovered from his mono, and I also want to read about Emily's experiences at college! <br />A great chick book written in emails, Life, Love, and the Pursuit of Hotties is another installment of the Emily Williamson series that should not be missed. <br />Recommended.	2005-07-19

Travis Ellroy hasn't had it easy, especially after his seemingly-perfect brother, Richie, committed suicide. One day, after an argument with his father, he fills his pockets with rocks and starts throwing them. One of them inadvertently hits the windshield of a black Taurus - the car of one of the most popular guys in school, P.J. After this incident, P.J. is furious with Travis, hassling and threatening him at school, and it doesn't help that Travis can't get enough money ($300) to pay P.J. back for the broken windshield, no thanks to his lousy, low-paying job at Coffee Time.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, Travis doesn't exactly have the best reputation at school. He is a misfit who only has two real friends - Moira and Ross - and is known for being crazy and whacked.  <br />His application for a promotion at Coffee Time is rejected, and instead, Jordan, a classmate of Travis's, gets it.  <br />Travis's hopes of winning the affections of the prettiest girl in school, Koryn, are crushed, after he discovers his feelings for her are unrequited.  <br /> <br />Then a new guy comes along - Daniel Pulver. Daniel is a tough, courageous character, who befriends Travis and teaches him how to defend himself against bullies like P.J. Not only that, but Daniel encourages Travis to be angry and violent - turning him against his parents, Jordan, Koryn, his best friends, Moria and Ross, and others. He fuels Daniel's anger - the type of guy who says, \\"You gonna take that from him?\\"  <br />Daniel also introduces Travis to \\"The List\\" - of people who need to be shot. Ultimately, Daniel teaches Travis how to maneuver and work a gun. <br /> <br />Before he knows it, Travis's world is spiralling out of control. He's not himself anymore; he becomes indifferent; apathetic; more angry; more violent.  <br />And then... Travis does something that will change the lives of the people around him - and his - forever. His irrevocable action is the gripping and suspenseful climax of this riveting story, leading directly to its chilling conclusion.  <br /> <br />Adam Meyer has done a terrific job of effectively writing a harrowing, chilling book that will appeal to readers of a young adult audience. This book will interest males and females alike. Travis's voice is fresh, real, and it reverberates in your head long after the book is finished. His emotions and violent fantasies epitomize those who have been pushed to the very edge, whose last domino has fallen down.  <br />Each character in The Last Domino is well-rounded and developed, making the story that much more believable. The characters in this book aren't characters that you will just read about and forget - even while reading the story, I found that I was concerned for these characters, that I actually cared about them.  <br /> <br />I finished this book in one day - it was just that compelling. I even stayed up 'til 3am reading it, but I didn't mind. In fact, I had trouble sleeping even after I finished the book, because I couldn't stop thinking about it.  <br /> <br />Evocative, riveting, suspenseful, and exciting, The Last Domino is an utterly fantastic book that deserves to be read by all teens. It is memorable; the characters are so real, so palpable, that you feel like you know them; and the writing is superb. It touches upon a sensitive subject, but it is written in such an effective manner that it isn't just a clich. Adam Meyer is a young adult author to look for - he brings a whole new perspective to things, and I look forward to reading more of his work. <br /> <br />The Last Domino is a must-read, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an engaging, page-turning book that you won't be able to put down.	2005-07-17

Why did ancient civilizations arise when they did? Why were some areas more agriculturally prosperous than others? Why was it the Europeans that colonized the other continents and not the other way around?  <br />Such questions are explored, delved into in a comprehensive, thorough manner (despite the fact Diamond is cramming thousands of years of ancient history/geography into a 400-page book) and, ultimately, answered.  <br />Jared Diamond's research, especially of New Guinea and the New Guineans, is interesting. It is clear he has spent a lot of time learning about New Guinea (how it used to be part of Greater Australia) and how New Guineans live now (and in ancient times). It seems Diamond has been devoted to this cause for years and this is one reason why Guns, Germs, and Steel is so effective. <br />I also like how Diamond explains the concepts in his books in an accessible manner, ensuring that other people (who do not necessarily share his academic background) can understand his book. Nevertheless, Jared Diamond substantiates his facts with well-researched, plausible, and valid evidence.  <br /> <br />One is guaranteed to learn much about history, different cultures and how they arose, geography, and much more. It is all packed into this 400-something-paged book, a Pulitzer Prize winner titled Guns, Germs, and Steel. <br />I am not a heavy non-fiction reader, and Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the few non-fiction pieces I've picked up for awhile. Even for a heavy fiction reader who wouldn't normally read non-fiction, this book is compellingly fascinating in its attempt to explain the trajectory of ancient societies and how those courses affect the modern world today.  <br />I highly recommend this book to people interested in such topics, or even if you have no real interest and just want to read an interesting, engaging non-fiction book. This book will edify your knowledge on things that matter and topics worth thinking about. <br />	2005-07-15

In Unexpected Development, Megan narrates her summer vacation in an assignment for Honors English.  <br />Readers learn from Megan that being top-heavy is not exactly ideal - she recounts the verbal and sexual harassments she endures from various males in her life - especially an obnoxious boy who can't seem to leave her alone, and not to mention her boss, Mr. Cooper, who is just a creepy pervert.  <br />Megan also explores her true first love - and all the things that come along with it, including sex. She is not sure if she can trust Jake Darrow, the boy she has been crushing on for years, and who is now just starting to show interest in her. Does he like her for who she is or just her body? <br /> <br />Megan endures her summer vacation with her best friend Jilly, who seems like the perfect best friend - always quick to come to Megan's defense and fiercely loyal. Megan also contemplates getting breast reduction surgery. <br /> <br />All in all, Unexpected Development is a fabulous novel, especially for teen girls. It really clears up some myths that most teen girls are deceived by - namely, that having large breasts is not all glamour and glitz. Megan addresses these issues honestly and poignantly. <br />Megan's relationship with Jake is also very interesting.  <br />Perez has a wonderful writing voice. It actually seemed like a teenager was writing this book - it is just so authentic.  <br />Unexpected Development is a fantastic coming-of-age novel that explores body perception, boys, friends, and love. I highly recommend this book to teen girls looking for an engaging book to read.	2005-07-09

It makes you re-evaluate how society is living now and where, ultimately, we are going with our harmful ways of living. Wright makes insightful connections between ancient civilizations (the Easter Islands, the Maya, the Romans, and the Americas are explored) and contemporary society.  <br />I found Wright's tone a bit didactic, but I think perhaps that was his intention. The author has a significant message meant for everyone, and to gain a deeper understanding of what Wright's message is, one must read this book.  <br />The text is easy to read, and most parts are easy to comprehend, but take your time with this book. It is not a book to read when you're in a rush to finish it. In order to fully absorb Wright's carefully-researched information, one must contemplate thoroughly what he is saying and what implications it means for society at large. <br />Perfect for History buffs or anyone in general who is interested in progress (or rather, progress traps) of civilizations, A Short History of Progress offers fascinating insight into ancient civilizations that parallel society and civilization as we know it, today.	2005-06-30

This book is utterly readable. Burroughs' has done a fine job writing this book - the sarcasm, the unique sense of humour, the overall recount of his strangely bizarre childhood. <br /> <br />I have to admit, there were a few parts in this book that really disturbed me, but only because they were so blatantly sexual. But, I do appreciate Burroughs' honesty and candidness, and I think that's what makes Running with Scissors so appealing. Dr. Finch's theory that God was communicating with him via his turd was hilarious, and I could not stop laughing when I read this. The bizarreness of Burroughs' childhood is grotesque and, at times, humorous. <br /> <br />The squalor that Burroughs' had to experience at Dr. Finch's house was appalling. It almost seemed implausible. There were many parts of this book that surprised me, though. The Finches were anything but normal, and their odd reactions and behavious puzzled me. <br /> <br />All in all, Running with Scissors was a truly compelling book to read. Burroughs' has candidly, (sometimes humorously), and eloquently written about his bizarre childhood in a way that stands out and just makes you want to know more. Once you get sucked into the pages of Burroughs' life, you will not be able to stop reading. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining peek into a young boy's very strange childhood - or, if you are just looking for an utterly compelling memoir. This book deserves to be read, although I would not recommend it to a young audience due to the ample profanity, graphic sexual content, and some instances of violence. Other than that, go ahead and read this book, for those of you who think you can handle it. Welcome to the wonderfully bizarre childhood of Augusten Burroughs, and enjoy!	2005-06-25

I did end up feeling sorry for her, what with all the horrible experiences she went through. I really disliked her father for what he did with her - playing naughty secretary and the like. <BR>This book will draw a lot of sympathy from readers towards the little girl that is Thelma. How Thelma asks various people to become her parents is absolutely heart-wrenching.<br />The novel is about Thelma's coming of age - written in seemingly short stories about the different stages of her life.<BR>Despite her rough experiences in childhood, she manages to get a scholarship to law school.<BR>Mouthing the Words is about Thelma coming in to know herself, of accepting herself, trying to find out who she is - and, ultimately, finding that much-needed courage to mouth the words. <br />I really enjoyed this book. I could really relate to Thelma being a misfit. <br />Ms. Gibb writes powerfully, honestly, and expressively. I think she has really captured the essence of what it is like to speak through a child's eyes, in the face of neglect, abuse, and other experiences.<br />I had the honor of attending one of Ms. Gibb's readings, and even got my books signed. She is a very nice lady, and I am eagerly waiting to read her other books.	2005-05-18

I even asked him, \\"What are the best aspects of being a writer?\\" He (jokingly, I think) said that it was the working at home part :) <br />He was a truly entertaining, funny, and delightful man. He put so much expression into his voice when he read from Funny Boy. <br /> <br />Well, I just finished Funny Boy yesterday, and I must say that it was a very refreshing read! I loved all the descriptions of Ammachi and Appachi's house, and all the wonderful, vivid descriptions of Sri Lanka. It really brought me into another world, and I loved it. <br />Shyam writes simply and beautifully; his writing is not at all confounding and is very accessible. I found I breezed through the book. It was also very compelling. <br /> <br />Arjie's coming-of-age in Funny Boy is one that everyone must read about. His emotions are rare, powerful, and they stick with you. The other characters in the book are also interesting. I especially liked the story about Arjie and Shehan. Another story I liked was one of the first ones - when they played bride-bride, and how they called his cousin, \\"Her Fatness.\\" I laughed hysterically. <br /> <br />Shyam is an author to look out for. I am looking forward to reading his oher works. He has a talent for writing beautifully and searingly - yet, he never fails to inject a little humour/comic relief to lighten up the mood.  <br /> <br />I absolutely loved Funny Boy and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good read. Kudos to Mr. Selvadurai! <br />	2005-05-03
US	29326123	R32U4LN1PHWO3S	0887621678	679938671	A Perfect Night to Go to China	Books	5	6	7	N	N	An intriguing read	A Perfect Night to go to China was an interesting book that compelled me - because, as soon as I got into the first couple of pages, I thought, &quot;Whoa.&quot; And curiosity sunk in. <br />   Roman, the protagonist, makes the biggest mistake of his life one night. He leaves his little boy alone for fifteen minutes to stroll into a bar.<br />   When he gets back, his son Simon is gone.<br />   At this point, the reader can sense Roman's mental and physical descent. He becomes obsessed with finding his son, believing that his son is communicating with him. Whenever he sleeps, he slips into a world, seemingly of the dead. He sees his mother there and, even, Simon. At these times he visits Simon, holds him close, tells him he misses him. <BR>Meanwhile, his wife doesn't want to see him, he gets fired from his job. His behaviour is strange and at times he does not seem all there. <br />I'll have to admit it was heart-breaking to read this book. You really get a sense of what it's like, losing a child. How it becomes the centre of your world. Everything seems trivial to that one big gap in your life. And what shocks Roman is that, at times, he momentarily forgets about Simon. For example, when he sees a menacing dog. He is surprised, shocked, maybe even a little disappointed in himself, that he could, even for a moment, forget about his son.<br />A Perfect Night to go to China was a clear and easy read. It isn't even 200 pages, and I found that I breezed through it. Gilmour's writing is accessible. I love the way he uses similes - you can always picture his images and he doesn't use obscure words like some authors do. His dialogue is also very striking.<br />The title still strikes me as a bit of a mystery - I can see why he named his title that, but I am just wondering, Why China? <br />All in all, A Perfect Night to go to China is recommended. I'd recommend it especially to parents who have suffered the loss of a child, although that isn't a requirement. I am only 17 years old and I found this book intriguing. It is different, and that's what makes it original. <BR>This is some fine work.	2005-04-27
US	29326123	R33PWXFQHUQUP7	0060512822	951868170	The Poisonwood Bible: A Novel	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Stunning	Barbara Kingsolver has really done her research.  <br />The Poisonwood Bible focuses on a Baptist missionary who takes his four daughers (Rachel, Leah, Adah, Ruth May) and his wife, Orleanna, to the Congo, to try to save the Africans' needy souls. <br />Of course, just writing that would not do the book any justice at all. It is one of the best works I have read in awhile. <br />The story is narrated by Nathan's four daughters and his wife, Orleanna. <br />They each have their own distinctive personalities: Rachel - spoiled, Leah - wants to impress her father, Adah - physically disabled, loves word play, and Ruth May - kind of naive and the baby of the family.  <br />Orleanna, too - helpless at most points in the novel. <br /> <br />From each of their perspectives, they tell their story. How they adjust to the Congo, how they more or less have to fend for themselves. <br /> <br />The descriptions of the Congo - how the kids and people run around naked, or with little to no clothing, the destitution the Congolese are living in, how they excrete their wastes behind bushes... everything is so authentic. The vivid, powerful descriptions will make you feel as if you're in the Congo. <br /> <br />The Poisonwood Bible deals with religion, race, politics, sins, and many different kinds of love. Kingsolver's prose is eloquent, searing and, at times, utterly poetic. Beautiful. <br /> <br />This is a masterpiece not to be missed. I only regret that I hadn't read it sooner. Everyone must read this book. Highly recommended.	2005-04-04
US	29326123	R15MZMUPG0CNKC	0345361792	438809520	A Prayer for Owen Meany	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Delightfully engaging	A Prayer for Owen Meany was a delight to read. It was written in the point of view of John Wheelright, Owen Meany's best friend. Now, Owen Meany is a dwarfish boy who has a weird nasally voice. Johnny recounts his time with Owen Meany and what eventually happens to him in the end. <br /> <br />Written like a memoir, with seemingly random memories splayed out, John Irving has created a well-written novel that is utterly compelling to read. What really drew me to this book was the character Owen Meany. The way he is described is just so ethereal - and he seems so adorable. <br /> <br />The whole novel is sort of like a hidden puzzle, and all the pieces fit together nicely in the end. There is also a fair amount of meaningful symbolism involved in A Prayer for Owen Meany - like armlessness, for example. <br /> <br />The only drawback to this book was, I did not particularly enjoy Johnny's diatribes on politics - mostly on America and Reagan. I suppose those who are interested in politics and those types of issues would be interested, but I frankly was not. Being ignorant of the issues Johnny was complaining about, I found myself getting irritated when he incessantly complained. Despite this dislike of mine, Johnny's bashings on politics is essential to analyzing Johnny's character.  <br /> <br />Overall, A Prayer for Owen Meany was an enjoyable read. It is a long book, yes, and there are many events that occur, but the reader will see that it all is meaningful, and makes sense in the end. The ending of the novel is poignant and not at all anti-climatic. John Irving has done a fine job of characterization and developing a well-thought-out plotline. <br /> <br />Owen Meany is essentially a book on religious faith, but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a long, engaging read.  <br />	2005-03-28

Then it just got more farfetched. Beaner O'Brian is trying to write a paper on the opposite sex. Her dad is a talent scout on some teen music show. She meets one of the guys from one of her fave boy bands. He kisses her on national television. <br />This didn't seem realistic at all! The writing was tedious, farfetched, and didn't hold my interest. In no way did I feel compelled to go on reading, but I forced myself to. However, I got so frustrated with this novel that, about half way through, I gave up.  <br /> <br />I just could not read it. The plot is transparent and farcical. The characters are over-exaggerated and unconvincing. <br /> <br />Usually I am not the type of person to bash books, as I love reading. I am a big fan of Young Adult fiction and especially the Smooch books. But this is just one book I could do without. <br /> <br />Only read this book if you are completely bored and have nothing else to do. Occupy your time with something else. Needless to say, I did not think this was a good contribution to the Smooch books. <br /> <br />Maybe I am just outgrowing these kinds of books - after all, Beaner is 2 years younger than me. Maybe these books are really intended for a younger audience. Yet I have read other Smooch books that did hold my interest, despite the fact that some of the main characters were younger than me. <br /> <br />I truly resent the time that I spent trying to read this book. I could have been reading a good classic or something. Well, now I know not to read this book again. I have given it a lot of chances and it just didn't work out for me. <br /> <br />If you are really curious about this book, get it at the library. Sorry for this utterly bad review, but I'm quite angry at the way this book turned out.	2005-03-28

Her father is dead. It seems her whole family is unstable. Her mother, although putting on a happy facade, cries at night for her dead husband. Her annoying sister is sad, too. Isabelle is also sad. It seems she is oppressed in expressing her feelings, though, which is why she chooses bulimia - as an outlet. <br /> <br />Isabelle is forced to go to Group - a group that helps people with eating disorders. To her shock, Ashley Barnum, the most popular girl in school, is also in Group. They develop a friendship that makes Isabelle learn more about who Ashley really is, and, ultimately, about herself.  <br /> <br />This book is one book that you must read. Although it is geared towards younger teens, I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book about an eating disorder - and, not only that, but one of coming of age. This would also be a great book for parents to read. <br /> <br />The characters are real. You feel their emotions, and you are taken on a journey through Isabelle's life.  <br /> <br />Honest and well-written, Perfect is a book that should be in every library's shelves.	2005-03-20

Dorian Gray was quite the read.<br /><br />Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.<br /><br />Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"<br /><br />This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.<br /><br />The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.<br /><br />The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good classic read.recommended to anyone looking for a good classic read.	2005-03-19

She likes a boy named Tommy, but then her best friend Darcy starts dating him. She feels betrayed and is left to deal with her emotions. <br /> <br />I found this book funny at times. The narrator uses a humorous tone and is very wry and sarcastic. It also seems candid. <br /> <br />However, I docked off one star because I found mistakes in the text. Don't get me wrong - there are mistakes in a lot of texts. But, usually, there are only 1-2, at most. In Louie, there were apostrophes where they weren't supposed to be, no apostrophes when needed, spelling mistakes. It reminds me of another book I read - Nightmares Echo. Come to think of it, they had the same kind of cover and everything. Anyway, just a suggestion to the editor of the novel: please proofread.  <br /> <br />Other than that, the novel was a quick read - something to do on a lazy afternoon.  <br /> <br />Recommended for younger readers (8th grade).	2005-03-19

It is about young Werther, who falls in love with a married woman. Yet he cannot stop obsessing about her. His obsession drives him and becomes fatal. Once he realizes there is no hope between them, he commits suidice. <br /> <br />The prose is excellent - almost poetic.

My favourite was, \\"Must it so be that whatever makes man happy must later become the source of his misery?\\"  <br />Oh, Werther ! <br /> <br />This is a great classic for everyone to read - but I recommend it to mature readers. The language is okay enough, but if you're not used to reading books written in a different era, you might have some trouble getting through it.

It's summer, and Cole sees a bike he really covets. He goes job-hunting to earn money for the bike, and gets hired by Sam Kerrigan. Now, Sam Kerrigan isn't your average nice man.

I found that when I was reading, it became increasingly harder to put it down. I'd even neglect my homework to continue reading it. <br /> <br />Kate is so real - and incredibly brave. She was fourteen, and she was dying. Having someone so young, under the worst circumstances, being so optimistic about life was just incredible. I also enjoyed reading about her life - her parents, her falling-out with her best friend Josie, the town recluse (whom Kate befriends), and who could forget Randy, Kate's love interest. Everything tied in together nicely, and I liked the diary first-person format. It made everything that much more personal and real.  <br /> <br />The other members of the book club also enjoyed the book. We all thought Kate was admirable - someone to be highly commended for her bravery, strength, and overall optimism of life, even though she was dying. <br /> <br />However, the book was very sad and heart-wrenching at times. I shed a few tears at the end - so be sure to keep a box of tissues nearby!  <br /> <br />Thank you, Mrs. Sherrard, for writing such a poignant and wonderful story. <br /> <br />Kate was a fantastic read.

I just finished reading Life of Pi last night, and I must say that I am... impressed. <br />What a thought-provoking fable! I was a little tentative to read Life of Pi at first, since I had seen mixed reviews for it. Some thought the book was very confusing or very slow. But, after a long period of procrastination, I finally picked up the book and started reading it. English teachers at my school had read it and told me that it was a good read. <br /> <br />Well, I thoroughly agree with them. Life of Pi is about 16-year-old Pi Patel and how he gets stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger named Richard Parker, from his father's zoo. This was the result of his cargo ship sinking in the Pacific Ocean. Pi's family are most probably dead.  <br /> <br />Life of Pi tells of the adventures and journey of Pi Patel and the tiger, Richard Parker, through the most difficult of circumstances. It is amazing how they managed to survive for around 200 days in a lifeboat. Pi, a former vegetarian, is forced to eat fish and other sea-life for sustenance. He even manages to tame Richard Parker.  <br /> <br />While I was reading it, I kept imagining myself in Pi's shoes - I would be dead terrified if I were stuck in a lifeboat with a 450 pound tiger in the Pacific Ocean. I admired Pi's courage, hope, and determination to stay alive. <br /> <br />This book will make you think. It may, as stated in the book, even make you believe in God.	2005-01-22

I picked it up after I thought it would be kind of like Eats, Shoots and Leaves. It deals more with sentence structure, though (although some parts of it does deal with grammar). <br /> <br />Harris writes about our \\"inner child writer\\" and how it still has a lot of repressed feelings, which is why we lash out and write bad sentences. I didn't really consider myself a malescribe, but I can certainly understand the frustration and disappointment when you encounter one. <br /> <br />Although this book was informative and humorous, my only complaint was that it went a little too far. At times, parts of it seemed far-fetched and there was a bit too much exaggeration. I know this was supposed to be a humorous approch - but maybe less is more. For example, Harris states that malescribism can lead to depression, and even death. Well, I'd say very rarely. <br /> <br />Despite my one dislike about it, When Good People Write Bad Sentences is a humorous and informative read. Especially when you have malescribism. (Oops, was that supposed to be a sentence fragment?) :)	2005-01-22

Frankly, I had never heard of Synesthesia before picking up A Mango-Shaped Space, and I found it so interesting. <br /> <br />I recommended this book to my book club at school. Some of us have finished the book, while some are still in the midst of completing it. However, we all have the same opinion: the book is fantastic. It's been described as \\"unputdownable.\\"  <br /> <br />I'm so glad I recommended it to my book club. This is a great read, whether you know about Synesthesia or not. I think we all share an affinity with Mia once we're reading the book (being different in some way). And who can forget Mango, her cat! And Zack, her adorable little brother! <br /> <br />You will love the plot and characters of A Mango-Shaped Space. It is also great for reading together in book clubs - I find that it stirs up some interesting discussions. <br /> <br />Mrs. Mass has taken a humorous and interesting approach to informing others about Synesthesia.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-01-22

A delightfully humorous read, Tell it to Naomi is about a plan involving an advice column turned awry. <br />This book made me laugh and I really enjoyed reading about Dave (a very likeable and adorable protagonist)'s antics - and even his way of talking :) <br /> <br />I have read Ehrenhaft (well, he has a pseudonym)'s other work (The Wessex Papers), and I think he has a very smart and clever way of writing. The humour is wry and very entertaining, and the plots are always intriguing. <br /> <br />A good, light read. Recommended.	2005-01-19
US	29326123	R1N1FMTJLPFXNN	1592866220	541901292	Nightmares Echo	Books	2	37	41	N	N	A good read, but...	This book was harrowing in its true account of numerous forms of abuse, including incest from the lady's father. Yes, it was emotional. But the grammar and spelling mistakes and overall typographical errors in the book deterred from its literary value.  <br />There were copious mistakes and I felt frustrated when having to read incorrect sentences. I kept wondering who edited the book and thought perhaps this book was self-published. An author should take the time to re-write her manuscript and have others (preferably an editor) proof-read and correct her work. Now, everyone makes mistakes, and one or two are okay in books, but when the number of mistakes exceeds ten, you know you have a problem. <br />I do admire Mrs. Stewart's courage and bravery through her ordeal. I felt that Nightmares Echo was a book of self-discovery. The flaws to it, though, were the grammar/typo/spelling errors, and I felt somehow that the book was written a bit childishly.  <br /> <br /> <br />Despite my complaints of this book, I appreciate Mrs. Stewart's honesty and her decision to write a book that she thought might help others who are in the same position she was in, or just for people who are interested about learning about abuse.  <br /> <br />Overall, this book is a short read. I read it in two sittings. Read this book if you're interested in reading about the true account of a lady's abuse. Don't read it, however, if you are a pedant when it comes to grammar (like me) and feel like tearing your hair out when you see grammar mistakes and typos in books.	2005-01-08

The book itself started out very sad from the beginning. But when I read the chapter about the good-bye, I just broke down. <br />This book has touched me so much, and there was so much truth in Morrie's words. He was a wonderful teacher. <br />Tuesdays with Morrie has changed my attitude about life. I now know to live life to its fullest, and to share love with people. Morrie's undying love for teaching, his optimistic attitude, all of these tenacious, strong qualities of him make him a fantastic man. There is so much I have learned, and I feel that this book is the epitome of inspiration and hope. <br /> <br />This book is definitely worth the read. I first read Mitch Albom's The Five People You meet in Heaven, and would also strongly recommend it. Tuesdays with Morrie is not a very long book, and I found it a quick, sad, but inspirational read. I have recommended it to my book club and I hope everyone will pick up a copy of this book, for it has wisdom and love to share. Mitch Albom has written a book that deserves five stars, no doubt about it.	2005-01-08

A taut, spine-tingling, and cleverly written book, Some Reason in Madness is guaranteed to give you eerie chills. <BR>Basically, the book is about a guidance counselor, who was raped 15 years ago. <BR>She is finally beginning to start a new life after the horrible encounter - she has a great boyfriend and a wonderful son.<BR>Then, ugly purple flowers gets delivered to her - without a signature. The phone calls start. She comes face to face a couple of times with Frank Ventresca, the man who raped her 15 years earlier.<BR>This book is written in the third person ominous - it alternates between the characters' different perspectives, including Samantha's (the protagonist), Frank Ventresca (the rapist), Matthew (Samantha's son), Chris (Samantha's boyfriend), among other characters. I thought the narration was wonderful, and it was very insightful to read about different characters' points of view.<BR>The way the story was told was coherent, easy to understand, and very clever. Nothing too complicated, this book is quite breezy. I finished it in about 2 sittings, and I found that I was hanging on to the edge of my seat in several chapters.<BR>Some Reason in Madness is definitely worth the read. Highly recommended.	2004-08-29
US	29326123	R217UVXO0WV8F2	0802139272	457262656	Innocents	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Vulgar, but interesting concept	Dark and twisted, this book is an intense read. <br />It deals with the manipulation tactics of a 16 year old girl who seduces her teacher. <br />She moves in with him and they have a very sexual relationship. <br />There were many odd things about this book, though. Things just seemed uncanny - like how the aunt and uncle made no real effort to drag her back to their house. She IS a minor, after all. <br />The amount of vulgarity and sexual content in this book is extreme. This book is not for the prudish, or the squeamish. <br />The sex scenes are extremely graphic and steamy, and some are quite revolting. <br />Over all, this book was well-written. The author, I think, was very precocious, as there were a lot of big, descriptive words used throughout the book. <br />It was just the element of uncanniness in this book that made it lose a star. At times, it didn't seem very realistic at all. <br />All in all, an intense, steamy read - a perverse look into the strange intricacies, and hidden desires of the human psyche. <br />	2004-08-20

I liked the ending, even though it was shocking and very sad!! <BR>Um, yeah, I think this novel is geared more towards teens. Around 15-18 year olds.<BR>I never really gave vampires much thought until I read this book. I absolutely loved it.<BR>Ellen Schreiber as mordantly written a riveting story that is guaranteed to captivate you. Definitely worth the read. Highly recommended.	2004-07-03
