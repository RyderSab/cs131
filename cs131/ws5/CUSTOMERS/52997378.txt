Hillary has a lot of weaknesses that have yet to come to the surface, but must in a national campaign. She is hated by a great plurality of the electorate, and not just on the right either. The moveon.org/Howard Deaniac wing of the Democratic Party does not find her support of the Iraq War very appealing or very credible.<br /><br />Condi, on the other hand, has one weakness, despite her considerable talent and intelligence. She has never run for office before. The Presidency is rarely an entry leval job, with the exception of successful Generals like Washington, Grant, and Eisenhower.<br /><br />Still, what a wonder race Condi vs Hillary would be. I agree with Morris' premise to this extent--Condi would almost certainly beat Hillary. An African-American, Conservative woman who has risen on her own talent becoming President would just be too potent an idea to resist. But a man with political experience on the bottom part of the ticket--say George Allen or Mitt Romney--and Condi would win by a landslide, changing the face of American politics forever and extending the Democrats' stay in the wilderness for many more years.	2005-10-11

The armies of Grant and Lee clash near the town of Fredrick in Maryland in the final battle, with the fate of the Union at stake. The battle sequences are some of the most vivid ever out down on the page. One finds oneself cheering and crying alternately for those men who must fight and die, no matter if they wear blue or gray. The conclusion of the battle, and of the Civil War in the authors' altered reality, is filled with a kind of hope that maybe makes the blood letting worth it. Could a hundred years and more of hate and animosity and bitterness have been avoided? Could the promise of \\"all men are born equal\\" have been fulfilled in the 1860s? Oh, for what might have been.<br /><br />Two regrets. There doesn't seem to be a book in the offering of what exactly what country will emerge from the ashes of the altered Civil War. And, there will likely be not be a movie or series based on this fantastic trilogy. Still, if Ken Burns were ever in a whimsical frame of mind and wanted to make a mockumentary in the style of his outstanding series of the Civil War, he could use these three books as material.

The book, however, suffers from a couple of flaws.<br /><br />First, the narrative alternates between the years leading from the Apollo moon landing to the launch of the Mars expedition and the voyage to Mars itself. It is sometimes very hard to keep the two separate stories straight in one's memory. There is also next to nothing about what happens on Mars after the landing.<br /><br />Second, Baxter totally fails to suggest that doing Mars instead of the shuttle would have any effect on society and history outside of the US space program. This is doubly puzzling because he basis his altered history on a John F. Kennedy having survived Dallas a cripple. (That premise may be one built on quicksand. Recent revelations about JFK's health problems and his private feelings toward space exploration make the idea of his physical survival into the 80s problematic, not to speak of his advocacy of a manned mission to Mars.) Regardless, the survival of JFK to be a kind of gray eminence of the Democratic Party would have been an interesting concept to explore, even without the space theme.<br /><br />The story also has a bitter sweet air about it. Several Apollo lunar missions, as well as a number of unmanned probes such as the Pioneer and Voyager missions to the Outer Planets are cancelled to pay for sending people to Mars. And there is the faint whiff of melancholy that after humans return from Mars, there might be no further expeditions.<br /><br />--Mark R. Whittington (...)	2004-02-15

Their previous effort at alternate history, 1945, did not do very well, primarily in my opinion because that book was slapped together in haste to try to sell books based on Speaker Gingrich's name and fame.<br /><br />Not so this offering. The premise is simple. On the second day of the battle, Lee does not assault the Little Round Top. Instead, taking Longstreet's advice, he sends a goodly portion of his army round to the far right flank of the Union Army, seizing its supplies and cutting it off from Washington. What follows is a hellish bloodbath which is all the more searing to the Civil War buff as one sees what happens to familiar charecters such as Chamberlain, Hood, Armestead, and others. I cannot recommend this book enough. It is nothing less than a counterfactural Killer Angels.<br /><br />It is also, irritatingly, the first of a trilogy.

One would be right about the technical detail, but happily wrong about the story and the charectors. Bob Zubrin's First Landing is an awe inspiring epic about the first expedition to Mars, taking place just ten years in our future. He has populated his story with a strong group of all too human charectors, not the least of who are the crew of the Beagal. Driven apart by personality clashes, the members of the crew ultimately pull together to overcome disaster and hardship in a story that made me breathless several times during the reading of it.<br /><br />Dr. Zubrin, besides being a fine story teller, is the visionary engineer who developed the Mars Direct scheme to send humans to Mars and bring them back safely to Earth-depicted quite graphicly in the story. However one feels about a Mars program as the \\"next logical step\\" for America's space program, one cannot deny that now in fiction, as he has in countless speaches and in two highly recommended nonfiction books (The Case for Mars and Entering Space), Dr. Zubrin makes a strong case for his point of view.

Stars and Stripes in Peril continues Harry Harrison's story of an Anglo-American war in the 1860s, reuniting the formerly warring North and South. While the scenario Harrison presents in fascinating, the novel, like it's predecessor, is a disappointment. Its main drawback is it's total lack of three diminsional charectors. Harrison manages to make fascinating people like Grant, Sherman, and Lee cardboard cutouts, interchangable figures in set piece situations. The reader is also wanting to know what even more fascinating Civil War actors would have behaved in the scenario he presented (Chamberlain, Armestaid, and-of course-George Armstrong Custer comes to mind.)

The most vivid parts of this book are the battle scenes, where one not only smells the gore but the fear of men engaged in combat. The book succeeds less in it's depictions of historical  charectors, especially the egnimatic Alcibiades. However on the balance,  Tides of War is one of the best historical novels so far this year.<br /><br />(...)	2000-05-03

He embodies in one man a genius for ideas and a genius for action.<br /><br />The latter is not entirely belied by his  fall from the pinnicle of power. In his short years as Speaker he  accomplished much. He ended welfare as an entitlement. He turned chronic  deficits into lasting surpluses. The man who was nominally in charge of the  United States, Bill Clinton, is a cipher by comparison. History will show  that the most influential politician of the 1990s was Speaker  Gingrich.<br /><br />He was hated by his enemies, whose power he had taken away. He  was distrusted by his friends, to whom he gave power. That latter fact is  the irony of Gingrich's triumph. Those who owed Gingrich everything in the  end drove him from elected politics.<br /><br />Nevertheless it may be comforting  that the story of Newt Gingrich is not over yet. He continues in the  private sector to do what he does so well, to drive ideas and foster  change. If George W. Bush rises to the Presidency, he could do far worse  than to offer the former Speaker a cabinet post. That certainly would make  for an excellent second volume.<br /><br />--Mark R.

All of their banal evil is laid bare for even the most thick  headed Clinton sychophant to view. It was wonderfull to read this book, but  sad that it had to be written.<br /><br />(...)	2000-03-25

Return to Mars is a tale of interplanetary exploration which is flawed by stereotypical charectors (the evil businessman, the \\"spiritual\\" American Indian, the man-child who hates his father) and a politicaly  correct message. The message, which Bova beats the reader over the head  with the subtalty of a sledgehammer, interfeers with what otherwise is an  exciting story of exploration rich with scientific and technical detail.  Those space enthusiasts who dream of Mars as a new home for human kind will  likely take exception to Bova's anticapitalist, antihuman tone and the  message that Mars must become a science reserve, closed to human settlement  and development. Because of this controversial view, Return to Mars if  nothing else might stirr heated debate on what shape space exploration  should take in the coming century.<br /><br />--Mark R.

If Robert Heinlein and Tom Clancy had ever written a novel together, they might have produced something close to Back to the Moon. A rocket engineer and an American Indian astronaut \\"borrow\\" the space shuttle  Columbia on an epic adventure back to the Moon, on a quest to save the  future and redeem the great dream of space exploration. Almost thirty years  since man last walked on the Moon, the fact that people have not been back  has remained a blot on civilization. This story shows one way that blot can  be wiped out. With enough technical detail, suspense, memorable charectors,  and twists and surprises to satisfy all, Back to the Moon is a must read.<br /><br />(...)	1999-06-13
