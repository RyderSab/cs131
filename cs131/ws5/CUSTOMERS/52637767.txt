The gently ironic tone of the prologue flows gently into a narrative of contemporary life in dying mill town Empire Falls.  Miles Roby, the protagonist, is introduced as a  nice guy going nowhere.  He is surrounded by a menagerie of thoroughly exasperating secondary characters.  Particularly well drawn is his teenage daughter Tick, a junior in high school drowning in adolescent angst and incipient moral awakenings.  She is a chip off the old block.  Her mother is another story -- a broadly drawn self centered, self pitying drone.  Miles irascible father, a surprisingly likeable scoundrel had me in stitches with his myriad misdeeds, especially when he absconds with church funds aided and abetted by a crackpot priest.  The plot line unfolds to a tragic climax -- shocking, yet completely organic to the story.    Christian symbolism permeates the story without being preachy.  I particularly relished Timmie, the diabolical cat belonging to Francine Whiting.    I was sorry to leave  Empire Falls behind when I finished as I had grown quite attached to the people, the pulse, and the place. <br />	2005-03-08

I discovered this little book on Amazon.com and bought it for my daughter who was about to take the SAT again in the hopes of bringing up her math score.  I can tell you that it worked for her.  She raised her math score by 110 points!  The strategies in this book work -- at least they do for the old SAT.  I can't vouch for the new SAT that starts this year, but I strongly suspect the ideas will still hold. <br /> <br />Thank you Philip Keller for making a huge difference in my daughter's math score and putting her in the running for admission to the highly competitive colleges to which she has applied. <br /> <br />	2005-01-18

They thought it was terrific.  My expectations were high.  The story moves with insightful commentary that explains cultural differences between the West and East, with a peculiar Thai twist.  If you are obsessed with sex and see it as the all-consuming passion of life, you'll like this book.  If you don't you'll get bored and depressed at the thought of how preoccupied Western men are with their own libido, and how superior the author believes the eastern approach to sex is to our own egalitarian and platonic ideals.  At the end I felt terribly sad and a little disgusted with myself for having devoted the time to reading this voyeuristic and pandering work under the guise of Buddhist thought.	2005-01-18

The truth is this first novel is completely based and focused on Israel.  The love story is touching.  I share the view that the politics are simplistic.  Still, they have a ring of truth and as a person who is strongly pro-Israel I felt it was important for me to read this book.  I don't think the erratic movement from present to past was particularly effective.  At times I felt I was reading a romance novel.  That being said, I read it in its entirety in almost one sitting because I found it absorbing.  I certainly would recommend it to others.  I look forward to reading more of Ravel's fiction in the future. <br />	2005-01-18

For all its righteous anger at the mean spirited pettiness and mendacity of the Republic Party, Keillor remains steadfastly optimistic and patriotic about the best that America can be -- as Keillor believes still exists in his beloved Minnesota.  One can only wish to be as insightful and dead-on as Garrison Keillor in exposing the fallacies of the right wing pundits and politicians. <br /> <br />Homegrown Democrat is a wonderful book, with autobiographical points of reference.  to act as an antidote to the GOP convention taking place in New York. <br /> <br />It is also a quick read.

Kerry's Commanding Officer retracted his statements and concedes that Kerry actually deserved the Bronze Star.  That's consistent with his written recommendation three decades earlier.  Now he has retracted his retraction.  For a true account read the commentary by the man whose life he saved in The Wall Street Journal.  I guess O'Neill and others fear that Kerry's pattern of heroism in Vietnam will reflect badly on Bush's pathetic performance in the National Guard.

Having grown up in the sixties, the time period of most of the novel, I did not find the beginning of the novel as slow a go as did other reviewers.  The references to cultural icons, long forgotton slogans and paraphenalia brought the late fifties and early sixties back to life for me.  Extremely clever plotting kept me turning the pages.  The characters may not have been the best developed, but I liked them thoroughly and cared what happened to them.  I became emotionally engaged.  Parts of the story struck me as somewhat unbelievable, but the skill of the author helped me to suspend disbelief.  MacDonald was a superb guide to historical events of the period -- especially the Cuban Missle Crisis, which I remember so vividly.   Unfortunately, the story bogged down by the fourth section  twenty years later.  I could not relate to Madeleine twenty years later, her career or her relationships.  They did not come to life nearly so well.  I almost felt like this section was written by a ghost writer from People Magazine.  Mercifically, MacDonald returned to the seminal event that haunted Madeleine's adult  life and (I believed) destroyed her father's.  I had hoped for more resolution and a deeper grappling with the ethical issues of withholding significant evidence in a murder trial.  I can't believe Madeleine tore up the address of the CIA Officer who betrayed her father and rescued a Nazi War Criminal.  Didn't anyone care about the mysterious disappearance of  Henry Froelich?  His likely murder deserved as much attention as the murder of the little girl, but she seemed to have dropped this plot theme.  Probably the best compliment I can give The Way The Crow Flies is my disappointment when it ended.  I had grown attached to the characters and missed them.    I also longed to talk to someone else who had read this book.  So, of course, I am going to pass it on and encourage others to read this wonderful book.	2004-07-03

Her first effort, a collection of short stories, \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\",  was wonderful.  I read The Namesake as a short story (\\"Gogol\\"  in The New Yorker Magazine.   I have to conclude that it was more effective in an abbreviated form than as a full length novel.  I became bored with her lengthy descriptions of affluent upscale lives of Ivy League professionals.  Although I get her point about the emptiness of it all, I think it went on too long.  Still, the story held together and I could understand why the death of Gogol's father caused him to return to his Bengali roots and find new meaning in the customs and culture and his connectedness to his family.  While a quick  and enjoyable book to read, when it was over, I scarcely thought about it again.	2004-07-03

I visit the store  once a year and always inquire about the best new Canadian fiction.  Hence, I purchased The Life of Pi well before its sales took off.   Somehow, though, the concept of a man and a tiger on a boat struck me as a bit weird and Dr. Doolittle-esque. I put the book aside.   It was only recently that I began listening to the audio version when I had a long drive.  I forgot my initial skepticism as I listened to Part I with growing interest.  Then out of nowhere came Part II - &quot;The ship sank.&quot;  Suddenly this absorbing coming of age novel turned into an instant version of Jack London's riveting  &quot;To Light A Fire&quot;.  I was transfixed, engrossed, mesmerized, and could not stop listening.  When I took a break from the audio, I returned to the book, and back and forth until finally I was done.

It reads like a novel, with nuggets of wisdom and insightful observations on what truly goes into achieving an exceptional public high school.  This is not an uncritical look.  The pushy parents and students who would rather cheat than risk a grade below \\"A\\" are rampant.  But the message of success is clear -- excellent teachers, a supportive environment where all students are known, high expectations planted before puberty kicks in, and focus on an indepth, academmically challenging curriculum, rather than test scores, is the ticket.  Most refreshing is the total absence of educational & bureaucratic jargon.  School of Dreams is a must-read for anyone who cares about what is going on in public education today.  Kudos to Edward Humes for this breakthrough book.	2003-09-03

The beginning started a little shaky, and I was afraid that the book would be padded with insipid dialogue or formula plotting.  Boy was I wrong!  Shortly after Harry appears before the Ministry of Magic the novel takes off.  Since all of the books are cut of the same cloth, I can't say it was better or worse than earlier works.  I can just say it was terrific, funny, moving, tender, wise and all of those wonderful qualities that make me appreciate the gift we have in J.K. Rowling.  I loved it so much, I didn't want it to end, and when it ended, I felt impatient for book #6 to come out.  Harry Potter has done more for literacy than phonics; more for hope that the Red Cross, and more for joy than Christmas.  Sigh.  I love Harry.	2003-06-30

The plot poses an interesting juxtaposition between the protagonist's self actualiziation and the moral dilemma of abandoning a decent fiancee who has suffered a life altering tragedy.  The writing is infused throughout with empathy for all of her characters.  They are real and quite human.  The writer's biggest problem is indulgence.  Good editing would have made this a more successful first effort.  Towards the end I found myself bored and skimming to get to the end.  Still I stuck it out and having finished The Dive from Clausen's Pier I find it sticks with me.  The ending was emotionally satisfying.  Yet I couldn't shake the feeling that she would split again -- that she had not yet finished her journey.  I also wanted more exploration of the character Kilroy.  He was, for me, the most interesting but least realized character in the novel.  Hope to see more from Packer.	2002-10-13

Packett's novel is a wonderful tribute to the healing and uplifting quality of music and its ability to bring people together.  The lightness and humor that underscores the plot gives the story a buoyant quality even as it  hurdles the reader to the inevitable tragic denouement.

Ruth Reichl is a treasure.  Tender at the Bone is an absorbing and absolutely charming coming of age story of a gifted food conniseur, chef and writer.  Sandwiched between mouth watering recipes and tall tales of travel and counter culture is a childhood with some poignancy.  Her mother serves for more than foil and comic relief,  she is the major challenge in Ruth's life.  The ghost and horror revisits her in Berkeley when she is stalked by a strange woman who foreshadows future battles with mental illness.  I couldn't put it down.

Her journalistic portraits were never short of fascinating and the reality she portrays of a growing Islamic militancy as a potent political force in these countries quite alarming.  The pandemic hatred of Israel, Jews, and the United States is shocking -- not in the knowledge that it exists, but in its intensity.  When I finished God Has Ninety-Nine Names, I read (reviews) and was surprised to learn the controversy surrounding the text.  The most vicious among her critics is the respected intellectual Professor Edward Said.  However, I have to quote from Edward Said savaging of Judith Miller to show just how clueless he apparently was of the danger of religiously-motivated terrorism.  In 1996, he wrote in The Nation: \\" Never mind that most Islamic countries today are too poverty-stricken, tyrannical and hopelessly inept militarily as well as scientifically to be much of a threat to anyone except their own citizens; and never mind that the most powerful of them -- like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Pa kistan -- are totally within the U.S. orbit. ...The Islamic threat is made to seem disproportionately fearsome, lending support to the thesis (which is an interesting parallel to anti-Semitic paranoia) that there is a worldwide conspiracy behind every explosion. \\"  I doubt Mr. Said would have the audacity to make these claims again in the aftermath of September 11th.  History  has shown that Miller's analysis was not only thoroughly researched and credible but also, sadly, right on target.   God Has Ninety-Nine Names is an important book.  Read it.	2001-11-18

It was passed over to me by my daughter's music teacher as a &quot;good read&quot;.  And it is.  The writing leaves a little to be desired, but the characters and plotting suffice to carry the reader to the end.  What really makes the book, in my opinion, is the time period in which it is set, and the author's obvious attention to research and accuracy in presenting a bleak and backward time in 19th Century England during the cholera epidemic.  Strangely,  I probably would have dismissed the story had I not read it at a time when we  the possibility of biological warfare (mimicking the cholera epidemic in the novel) is very real.	2001-10-13

The malaise they found in the stories could have been solved by marriage counseling, etc.  It's the writing, stupid.  Jhumpa Lahiri thrives in the medium of short stories.  No word or image is wasted.  The setting is the immigrant experience in America but the palette is the human experience, the unbearing sadness of being alive.  The humor, the stalesmates, the battles, the losses, and the small victories are all there for the assiduous reader to discover.  Interpreter of Maladies succeeds as a beautiful and touching collection of connected short stories.	2001-10-13

I liked the sparse style, the portrayal of emotional and spiritual numbness, the way it begins and the way it ends.  The recommendation came from my librarian when I asked her if she had read anything interesting lately.  Earlier I had passed &quot;The Reader&quot; by having heard lukewarm comments from others.  But from the moment I picked it up, I didn't want to put it down.  Disturbing, yes, the relationship between a young adolescent boy and an older woman.  Shocking, too, to realize that Hanna was capable of such horrendous crimes.  Her shame at her illiteracy is poignant when it is so great that she accepts responsiblity for writing an incriminating document when, in reality, she did not have the capability.<br /> Was Michael Berg wrong in failing to alert the judge or at least discuss a valid defense with Hanna?  Neither character warrants much of our sympathy.  Yet of the two disturbing main characters in the novel, Hanna has the greater capacity to grow and accept responsibility.  Michael fails to connect to anyone -- even the daughter he loves.  <br />The Reader is a highly discussable book.  It would make an excellent choice for a book club.	2001-07-15

Fadiman's book catches you and forces you to question your preconceptions, prejudicies, and complacency.

The Spirit Catches You is a must read for anyone whose work involves contact with people from a very different little understood culture.  This is a tale of what happened to a beautiful Hmong child when fear and misunderstanding  between her parents and the medical community of Merced resulted in a tragic, and very likely avoidable, outcome.	2001-05-10

Stephen King has come a long way since &quot;Carrie&quot; which I often describe as the worst written book I have ever read.  It has taken me many years to pick up a Stephen King book again.  This came from my daughter who felt it explained the Sixties to her.  The first story is great with interesting characters and plot.  It  is evocative of a time in the early 60's that has long since ceased to exist except in the imagination.  I co~tinued on to the second story which does a great job of humorously describing the milieu of the mid-60's at college campuses, especially  the obsession with musical correctness.   Unfortunately,  after so many  silly heart games, one loses interest. I played hearts in college and never found it as compulsively addictive as King makes it sound.   From there it was mostly downhill.  King didn't capture the Viet Nam War for me.  I would have been just as happy to read the first story in the collection and move on to something more interesting.  That being said, I am glad to have read Hearts in Atlantis.  King does a nice job of tying together lose ends of the plot at the end.	2001-04-26

It has always intrigued me why her legend lives on and on in a world where beautiful blondes are as plentiful and ephemeral as butterflies.  What was it about Marilyn Monroe that has inspired the books, the songs, the photographic retrospectives decades after she's been gone?  Having just finished &quot;Blonde&quot; by Joyce Carol Oates, I think I know.<br />From her first to her last breath, the fictionalized life of Norma Jeane Baker exudes tragedy.  Her childhood is brutal, puberty puts her at risk, her early marriage is a fiasco, her treatment by her agent, her photographer, and the studio bosses unpardonably exploitive.  When she finally achieves fame, Norma Jeane is too fragile and broken to savor it.  She becomes her insecurities.  Even those who love her and wish her well (husband playwright Arthur Miller) can't save her.  She can only bring them down in her self destructive nose dive.  If there is any truth to her treatment by President John Kennedy, he was the most dispicable of all.  Oates never uses the image of a candle in the wind made famous by Elton John, but the metaphor works.  Norma Jeane, aka Marilyn Monroe, never ceases to be a fascinating case study.  Towards the end the writing gets a little sloppy and the reader grows impatient for the author to get on with the end, which one knows will be horrible, and yet when it happens it will break your heart .  You are sorry the book has ended because you can never get too much of the central character, her amazing life story and the stormy times in which she lived.	2001-01-23

I loved the sparse simplicity of the writing even though I was initially bored by the soap opera plot of a man in love with a woman, not his wife.   But then as it developed I thought, no, this story is more like a post-Cultural Revolution Good Earth.  Afterall, there is the loyal, long suffering  wife -- Shuyu, only in the modern version the husband abhors the fact that she has bound feet.  (In The Good Earth, the wife is equally unsuitable to the upwarding mobile farmer because she has big feet.)  In The Good Earth, the good wife steals precious gems and pearls to save the family from starvation.  Here, Shuyu's herbal remedies save the lives of Lin's twin sons who are wasting away from dysentary.  The concumbine in The Good Earth is little more than a Pekinese pet  masquerading as a human being.  In Waiting the second wife also becomes a bit of a haridan at the end.  At the end of the day, Lin Kong  realizes at last the gratitude and love due his loyal ex-wife and daughter. He begs them to take him back  as soon as the second wife dies -- which is imminent due to a bad heart.  Looking back, Lin is puzzled by the disaster that has become his second marriage and the ultimate failure of his life.  He thinks of himself as a good and civilized man.  What went wrong?  Was it waiting too long?  Did he miss the tide in the affairs of men?  Or  was it an absence of passion on his part?  Did he lack the ability to love, was he only able to be the object of a woman's love?   Lin played by the rules of the Communist society and led an unsatisfactory life.  The brute who raped Manna thrives despite the curse she places on him.  His brand of sociopathology serves him well in the modern capitalist China.  Well, life isn't fair, even in post revoluntionary China.  All of this makes for a most interesting and discussable book.	2001-01-05

But after putting down The Laws of Our Father unfinished, I thought I had had my fill of him.  What captivated me about Personal Injuries was, one, a Clinton-esque main character Robbie Feaver, and an intriguing plot line.  I cared about what happened to Feaver, I bled for his wife Rainey at the end stage of Lou Gehrig's disease, and hoped the undercover agent Evon would become more fully alive.  Turow's perspective that ethical dilemmas are rarely black and white appealed to me in the post-impeachment era.  This is a moving, life affirmative novel that paints a realistic picture of how law is practiced in the scrappy, workaday world.  Bravo, Turow!	2001-01-01

The book's engaging beginning captures you into a web of pain, confusion, and the terror of mental illness.  I am left with the horrifying image of Miriam, so unable to connect  to her two emotionally adrift children and her un- comprehending husband.  The intellectual obtuseness of both Aaron and Eliza foretell future battles with delusional states in adulthood.  There's a reason why the study of Jewish mysticism is forbidden to those under 35 who have not yet married or had children! That being said, Myla Goldberg writes extraordinarily well.  I'm very glad I read this book and I will pass it on -- but I must confess the ending is chilling and left me shaken.	2000-12-26

I liked it too, especially Novalee Nation, the hapless heroine who brings out the best in the people she encounters.  The book  affirms all that is good in life, without ducking the reality that bad  things happen to good people.  I hope this book doesn't romanticize the  reality of teen pregnancy so as to inspire young readers to look for hope  in Walmart  and the kindness of strangers.  But it an endearing      tale  that  exudes the humanity of people our society tends to dismiss and  discard.  Good read!	2000-07-05

The first chapters outline the birth and underpinnings of the SAT and are slow  going. One senses that an objective ability test was a step above the prep  school WASP pipeline to Ivy League schools that the SAT tried to replace.   The SAT was a boon to gifted students of the Baby Boom generation who  attended public schools and came from a larger geographic  area. Yet the  irony emerges that the people who most benefitted from the perks they  received due to high SAT scores were among its greatest critics.  And this  leads to a sustained discussion at the end of attempts to dismantle  affirmative action which the author presents as an antidote to the high  priority given to SAT scores.  The two narrative threads do not connect  very well and there seems to be a huge gap between the themes of the book.   Some obvious points are missed:  SAT scores are just one of many things  admissions committee looks at to get a composite pictures of candidates;   many people in America who don't attend Ivy League colleges are enormously  successful and many who do live quiet lives of academic and economic  desparation.  The many mavericks who take off and succeed without  prestiguous degrees is simply not discussed in this book.  More often than  not, employers look at what an applicant can do rather than transcripts  (though admittedly it opens doors).  One of our most popular Presidents,  Ronald Reagan, graduated from podunk university and George W. Bush showed  few intellectual gifts outside of his privileged family background.  American culture holds a special place for those who take risks (like Bezos  of Amazon.com -- I have no idea where he went to college) and special  talents (a la Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola who went to state  universities in California, not Ivy League institutions).  In summary, The  Big Test makes for interesting reading and has some insight into the role  of testing in our education system, but ultimately misses the larger  picture of who succeeds in America and why.	2000-02-27

You can finish it in an hour or two.  It tells the facts, based on newspaper accounts, of startling events that occured in the small town of Port Angeles in 1998.  Dr. Turner, a respected pediatrician, who had practiced in the community for nearly 25 years, was  accused of causing the death of a brain dead infant who stopped breathing  while nursing at home.  After two sustained attempts at resuscitation  Turner closed off the infant's nose and mouth.  The second sensational  event occurred several weeks later when the emergency room physician on  duty the same night brutally murdered his wife.  His defense -- insanity  precipitated by the events in the emergency room.  A jury apparently bought  it and Dr. Bruce Rowan was found not guilty.  The people in the town were  so disgusted by the way these cases were handled by the 4-term prosecutor  that he was soundly defeated in the next election.  Charges against Turner  were eventually dropped with the concurrence of the judge and a special  prosecutor appointed to avoid the pervasive taint of local politics.  This  should make a fascinating story.  Unfortunately, Carlton Smith never goes  beyond the superficial to look at the underlying medical, legal, and  ethical issues is these two cases.  Nor does he capture the climate and  culture of Port Angeles, a blue collar timber and fishing town, very well.   The author  apparently failed to interview or even contact any of the major   characters in the story.  Mr. Smith seems more determined to cash in on  the immediacy of the story than the meaning of the events.  His thesis:   Arrogant doctors get away with murder.  Well, no.... <br />For much better  coverage of the Turner case,  &quot;A Baby's Death, A Town's Pain&quot;  written by Los Angeles Times reporter Barry Siegel is worth reading.  A  good study of what happened to Dr. Bruce Rowan and why has yet to be  written.  <br />From my perspective, Bitter Medicine was a hard pill to  swallow.	2000-02-25

Still, I found it enjoyable and the idea behind it very clever.  The ending left me feeling let down.  The idea, of course, was of a dark novel.

Gourevitch comments in the introduction that you must have some sort of sick curiosity to be reading the book.  But then he says,  perhaps it is more abhorrent not to look, not to want to understand.  It  helps a lot that it is a wonderfully written book.  It fascinates with  details and hidden insights.  And it breaks your heart with the fatalism of  the Hutus who courageously accepted their horrible, senseless fate.  I hope  many people read this book.  I suggested it to my book group and just got  apathetic shrugs.  The fact that I found it, and finally grabbed it, as  Costco is a hopeful sign of mass distribution.	2000-02-01

With the recent death of Joseph Heller, I felt compelled to go back and reread his masterpiece, Catch 22.  Thirty some years ago I read it as an undergraduate at San Francisco State in the midst of the Viet Nam War.   Looking at it again in my fifties, Catch-22 seems a bit more over the edge,  and yet the wit is still razor sharp.  The absurdities of war still ring  true. Heller reminds  us that the insanity of war is not limited to  pointless wars like Viet Nam. The craziness can even can be found in the so  called Good War.	2000-02-01

Crichton's resourcefulness in the world of theoretical science is emphasized more strongly than ever while he  makes a fine debut in the field of historically-based literature.   The  story may prove to be especially intriguing to those who have previously  defined the medieval period in terms of Monty Python and/or Period  Role-playing games(I speak from experience.)   My advice for the reader is  to avoid the frustration that may come if you read this novel expecting  only sci-fi or knights in shining armor and open yourself up to both angles  of this story.	2000-01-09

Through professional success, my mother hoped I would never have to deal with the drudgery of  housework.  The  unfortunate result of this outlook was that important information which was  transmitted from one generation to another, skills which BOTH men and women  need to run a household, was lost and forgotton -- that is, until Cheryl  Mendelsohn came along.  Home Comforts has a great concept -- a  comprehensive Joy of Cooking approach to running a  home.  I appreciate  that it's well written.  I'm glad the author is someone whose competence in  the professional world is beyond reproach.  I'm tempted to buy copies of  this book for friends and family members who, like me, have advanced  degrees  but are failing Housework 101.	1999-12-28

The conclusion, that only by playing by the  corrupt rules of the game can an innocent defendeant find relief are  sobering.  Siegel is very convincing in showing how things can go very  wrong.  The portrait of a power hungry prosecutor more concerned with  getting a conviction that convicting the guilty party has a ring of truth.     Siegel writes with the assurance of one who knows of what he speaks.  He  also does a good job at conveying a sense of place in the foggy California  town.  Personally, I didn't feel the characters were fully realized, but  the complex plot structure and intriguing ethical issues carry the book.   The Perfect Witness is a good read that got steadily more exciting as I  went along.  I found at the end, I couldn't put it down, and I was a bit  disappointed when it was over.  I highly recommend this book!	1999-01-18

The reader enters the psyche of the major players -- the heroically struggling working class parents, the true believer personal injury lawyer, the unjustly sacrificed physicians, the mercenary hospital staff, and the bottom line insurance company.  One senses the absurdity and inefficiency of our current system of compensating families of bad outcome babies, yet a better book might have explored some solutions or considered a more rational, saner way to go about remedying these dire situations.  Lacking the passion and rage of Harr's A Civil Action, the book sometimes collapses under the weight of all the details and changes in strategies.  That being said, Damages still offers a thorough and informative look at a protracted legal battle in which no one, except perhaps the Sabia family, comes out looking very good.	1998-06-24
