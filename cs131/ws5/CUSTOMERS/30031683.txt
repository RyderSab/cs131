From the moment you take up the story in Amsterdam in 1972, debuting author Elizabeth Kostova pulls you into this story with a unique mixture of a suspenseful story sprinkled with mystery, stirred with some historical fiction and seasoned with vampire lore.<br /><br />The root of the story revolves around Vlad the Impaler...a.k.a Dracula...and the belief that, although he was a vicious power wielder of the 15th century; he is still alive today.  The bases of this come from an unexpected discovery of letters addressed to \\"My dear and unfortunate successor\\", or otherwise known as the person who will have the misfortune of stumbling across the letter is guaranteed to have more excitement in their life than they really bargain for.  The letters are in the sixteen year old father's library in a cache with a medieval book that is blank except for a wood cut of a dragon.  Once the girl questions her father, he reluctantly reveals that he is involved in a search for his graduate school mentor who had the unfortunate fate of disappearing right after informing that he was on the trail of Mr. Dracula.<br /><br />For those that enjoy complicated storylines, this book offers a challenge.  During the course of the book, you need to follow three:  One of Professor Bartolomew Rossi in 1930 commencing the search, and thus, the story, one storyline of 1950, when the professor disappears and Paul (the inquisitive teenager's father in his youth) takes over the search for Dracula and, the principle narrative set in 1972.  What I loved most about the mixing of the three storylines is how the world and all of its mindsets are reflected so well with each era.  Each epoch brought a new face to the mother country of Dracula.<br /><br />Kostova has provided a good foundation for her novel with excellent research in fact and fiction of Dracula as well as providing an entertaining story that will leave the reader flipping the pages with anticipation.  A noteworthy debut by an author that promises to bring years of entertainment to the book industry.<br /><br />Frederick A. Babbentertainment to the book industry.      Frederick A. Babb	2005-07-04

One would think that a book dealing with suicide would be a dark, serious novel preaching prevention and promising that life is worth living.  Hornby has succeeded in breaking that mindset in a novel.  His ability to make a perfect cocktail out of humor, gloominess, and pleasure brings about a great tale.<br /><br />As an author, I can tell you that approaching penning a novel in first person is not the easiest of ways to write.  Doing it through the eyes of four different people makes for a somewhat complicated feat.  Again, Hornby has done so in impressive manner.<br /><br />As the story commences, it is New Year's Eve in London.  True to form, New Year's Eve can bring about such joy to the fortunate, but it rains depression for those that have problems in life.  The end of a year represents the reflection of personal failures.  The four failure reflectors in this case are:  Martin, TV personality that has suffered public humiliation; Maureen, a middle-aged woman who finds herself trapped in a life of caring for her adult son that is severely disabled which as prevented her from building a life of her own; Jess, the poster child of rebellion as an unstable modern day wildside punker with a father making life as a junior government minister; and last but not least, JJ, an American rocker who has had a career come to an abrupt halt so quickly that he wouldn't even make the list of \\"Whatever happen to...\\".<br /><br />This failing foursome meet up on the building in London commonly referred to as \\"Toppers' House\\", where they have arrived with one common goal; to commit suicide.  But a funny thing happens on the way to their ultimate deaths.  Between stories and reflections, the quartet finds a mutual bond to build on and, when morning arrives, they walk away rather than jump to their deaths.  Without every fully realizing it, they end up saving each others' lives from a destiny with no solutions.  As they go off on their separate ways, they understand that what had occurred that night has made them part of a group bonded by a special connection.<br /><br />What happens on that roof is best left for each to read.  But once you have, you will find yourself coming off of the roof feeling better as well.  Hornby has done a great job in this story.  A must read for everyone!<br /><br />Frederick A.

This is not just another book capitalizing on the current state of affairs in Afghanistan.  Rather, Hosseini provides us with an outstanding tale based on personalities so vivid and real that you can't help but to feel for them.<br /><br />Afghanistan provides the backdrop of Amir and Hassan.  They are two boys that come from very distinct walks of life.  Amir is at the top of the country's feeding chain while Hassan is the son of one of Amir's father's servants.  Growing up together, the boys knew little about class and power and more about becoming friends.  To better focus the differences, we are reminded that Amir is Sunni while Hassan hails from a Shi'a heritage. While Hassan was born with a hare lip for the world to see, Amir's has his own handicaps that are buried deep within.<br /><br />In a country that was verging on disaster, Amir and Hassan were ignorant to the world around them as they spent their days flying kites and sharing tales of supernatural worlds and brave combatants.  Life was good until, when the least expected turn of events occur, help to bond a friendship that would carry with them though life.<br /><br />Amin's father runs off to the protective arms of America.  Amin, as a boy, never learns to accept his father's action and feels as if he had betrayed his country, and more importantly, his best friend and considered brother.  Thus, when he is older, the chilling reminders of his father's action drive him back to his mother country, now under Taliban government.  When he returns he finds the playing fields of his youth transformed in to the killing fields of the new government.  The innocence of his youth washed away in a flow of a murderous bloody river.<br /><br />Amin's quest to find his forever friend, Hassan, opens his eyes to what he was protected from, or missed defending as his journey takes in through an Afghanistan orphanage, a reunion with a member of the ruling Taliban and a quest through his lost city and culture.  In the end, his journey fulfills him with the knowledge of truth and a life that he stakes his claim to.<br /><br />This tale reminds us that, no matter how far away a land might seem; its familiarity strikes back home in all of us.

Somehow, I don't think that such a distinguish author as William Faulkner needs to have the seal of Oprah's approval as a sign of excellence.  However, it does open the door for a new generation of readers to discover one of the great authors of the 20th century.  For that, I am sure that deep in William's grave, there is a bit of happiness occurring.  And for those readers who have never had the opportunity to enjoy one of the master's works; now is the time to discover what writing from the soul really is like.<br /><br />AS I LAY DYING:<br /><br />One family must come to face the task of burying their mother and wife, Addie.  Unlike so many books of today, Faulkner tells the tale from the many different points of views in a more heartfelt sense and not preachy as many stories attempt to do.  All the family's different points of view are brought together as the venture through the Mississippi countryside, with Addie's coffin, looking for the right place to bury her.<br /><br />THE SOUND AND THE FURY:<br /><br />Again, Faulkner takes on an unforgettable venture through the minds and words of the Compson siblings.  The mentally challenged Benjy, the phobic filled, suicidal Quentin and the hideous Jason tell the tale of their sister, Caddy.  A dysfunctional family if ever there was one that, given the year this story was written, dealt with their problems long before there was professional help available.  To counter their ways and problems, the Dilsey's (one of the servants) family provides the love and care.  Oh, and to demonstrate the sign of the times, the Compson family was white and the family of Dilsey's was black.  This story provides another reflection of coexistence in an era where racism was still the norm, not the exception.<br /><br />LIGHT IN AUGUST:<br /><br />Here we have an array of some of Faulkner's most enlighten characters revolving around a story that, again, reflects the overtones of racism.  Joe Christmas is the object of much discussion.  Is he black or white?  A mystifying wanderer traveling through the Deep South, his story outlines real life in that ambient lifestyle.  Faulkner doesn't sugarcoat the truth of life some 80 years ago and dignifies the human race with the ability to provide love and understand able to, with time, overcome the most horrendous mindsets of people.<br /><br />For those that have read these timeless classics, no review would ever do them the justice they deserve.  For those that have yet to discover Faulkner, now is the time to do so, this summer.  Thank you Oprah, for reopening the treasure box to the world!<br /><br />Frederick A. Babbiscussion.

His passion for American History and his esteem reputation for research are unparallel to most authors.  The time spent on this novel bear fruit of his dedication to facts.<br /><br />For fans of the author's book, \\"John Adams\\", this book will promise to enlighten that tremendous pivotal era when a new country, lead by such brave men risking their very lives upon deciding to declare treason on mother Great Britain, set forth their plans with a common dream uniting them.<br /><br />This book goes beyond the much told tales of crossing the Delaware river to claim victory in the Battle of Trenton, which provided more of a physiological than strategic win for the revolutionaries,  and details much less famous, but not any less significant battles that reflected the \\"never say die\\" attitude our forefathers possessed.  It also details the American revolutionary in the role of defeat in such victories that the British enjoyed.  They were defeats that would only strengthen the determination to succeed and create a free nation.<br /><br />In the end, the book demonstrated how history tends to repeat itself.  How many can relate to modern day wars created under the same pretense that King George III had when he decided that the colonists and their complaints were just a passing fade and soon, all would be controlled.  Doesn't that ring like the world's attitude towards Hitler before he started his own personal land-grab?  Also, the book reconfirms that George Washington was far more than the 1st President of our country.  He walked the walked and talked the talked in his belief of a free country.  His words were sincere and his convictions pure.  Something another President George should consider in today's world.<br /><br />Until now, the hard cold fact that the revolution of \\"1776\\" was on the verge of becoming a failure and our forefathers facing death for treason were known to only the diehard historian.  But this book details how a confident British permitted a sure victory to slip from their hands by underestimating the fortitude of our revolutionary leaders.<br /><br />On the negative side, for which there is very little, one has to wonder if it were the current world situation and American attitude towards France that were the driving factors behind their omission of the credit they so rightfully deserve in providing instrumental logistic support for the troops at a time when hope was quickly fading.<br /><br />Overall, this book will soon prove to be a timeless masterpiece.

For those that enjoyed the first three installments of the Women's Murder Club series, this will bring as much entertainment as the rest.  Maybe that is a good thing, and maybe it's bad.

This book, while venturing out in some new directions, also stands pretty much by the storyline that some may have already found running a bit thin in the first three books.<br /><br />Lindsay Boxer has already had more troubles in her life than most ever will.  So, as to not let up on her, this installment finds her on trial.  One day, all in a day's work for a police officer, a car chase takes a wrong turn.  Forced to survive a firefight with the bad guys, Lindsay terminates the problems of the two killers they were chasing, but not after they wound her and her partner. Collateral damage in the shootout finds a 15-year-old girl dead and her 13-year-old brother paralyzed.  Forget about making the world a safer place with two less convicts in it.  Cries of revenge root a police brutality lawsuit.<br /><br />Lindsay needs to get away from the media eating up the story and her every move.  So, she finds a safe haven in her sister's home.  Just to assure that she doesn't stay bored between court dates, she is also attempting to solve a recent killing that has all the same trademarks of one of her first unsolved case.  It is a case of someone killing off well to do married couples in the better part of town. Could the killer be playing with her or is it a copycat killer looking for attention?<br /><br />While Lindsay's running partners and pillars of friendship, Claire and Cindy, don't have as large of a supporting role in this book as in previous installments, they still appear to add a bit of that same camaraderie the first three books had.  Lindsay's boyfriend, Joe, also seems to not have found his place in the series.  He is there, then he isn't.  He needs to commit or back away from Lindsay.  I think adding a sidebar for some deep and committal romance would do Lindsay some good.<br /><br />Overall, a good read, but the series needs to either be given some new ideas and twist or brought to a conclusion.

When you read her poems, you cannot help but to see parts of your own life dancing across the pages, reminding you of days past.<br /><br />Each poem is not unlike a new path, leading us down another branch of life where memories, both tremendously treasured and bittersweet, hibernate in our mind.  Her poems travel through our own memories and we relive as she provokes our emotions with her words.<br /><br />Others have condemned the book for its editing, but I have chosen not to punish an author of such talent for the lacking of editing on the part of the publisher.  The editing errors are minimal and do not dam the emotions flowing from her words.  To place such importance on something so minuscule is doing a severe injustice to the author.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this collection of thought provoking poetry for anyone that seeks the challenge of having their passion of life taken for a rewarding sentimental journey.	2005-01-20

It gives valid sample on how we really need to stand back and take a deep look at ourselves.  Sometimes, especially after the bitter elections we played witness to, it takes a book like this to let us breathe a moment of absurdity into our lives and learn not to take everything so serious.<br /><br />The writers did their job in the homework department.  Far from taking cheap shots at the world in general, you can tell the preparation was thoughtfully planned out and the wit was the fruit of their devoted labor.  While you are busy chuckling at their view on American's political system, you might actually be able to learn a thing or two before you are done with it.  And... isn't learning with laughter the best way to learn?  A highly recommended read!!!	2004-12-09

Some reckon that it is a simple case of love or hate Bill Clinton to compare whether you are going to like the book.  Others feel that this is nothing more than a collection of stories and information already known to the public, but package in one book with the pure intent of making the ex-President all that much more richer.<br /><br />Regardless of the reasoning behind those reviews, I must state, up-front, that I was never impressed with Mr. Clinton's leadership qualities while never denying him his charismatic way of charming the American public.  This book does more to enhance his image in the eyes of his faithful followers while offering little new information on what makes the man tick.<br /><br />I was disappointed in three of the main issues I was seeking information on: Whitewater, Osama Bin Laden and Monica Lewinsky.  As was his presidency, so is his civilian life.  General information offered up front with no new real concrete information while still maintaining a certain degree of denial.  Although, if one were to read between the lines about his attempt of self-examination and self-therapy as well as marriage counseling and visits to holy men, you would come to determine the presence of truth in the accusations of other ladies pointed towards him.  This is not the path taking by a man who has made one \\"isolated\\" mistake such as he has always proclaimed with Monica.<br /><br />The book offers information on his childhood through his early political days up to his surprise \\"Comeback Kid\\" election over George Bush and re-election over Bob Dole.  Although it falls short in stating the true future intentions of both Hillary and himself.  Clinton does go out on his own to provide his opinion of many world leaders, past and presence.  In the end, though, the book leaves you yearning, regardless of your feelings towards Clinton, to the years of the calm before the storm that we live in today.  After the past two Presidential elections and the bitterness that has evolved from both, it is no wonder that he is seen more as a politically stable force in today's political world.  If only his book could have offered some insight on how to heal a nation.leaves you yearning, regardless of your feelings towards Clinton, to the years of the calm before the storm that we live in today.

This is an enhancing tale revolving around Dupont University, where America's best bet for the future receive more than just the education provided in the classroom.  It was much more than what Charlotte Simmons was banking on when she arrived from North Carolina.  Animal House lives on in this campus!<br /><br />Sex, kegs and ambitions turn college life into a soap opera that dominates everyone's life.  Is it any wonder that Charlotte will soon loose her virginity in this atmosphere?  With time, Charlotte blooms from her timid shell to take control of her life, as she becomes a key player in the lives of those around her.<br /><br />Tom Wolfe makes a valid attempt in capturing college campus life in modern day America.  Yet, somehow, his thoughts and ideas come off, at times, as outdated.  This may have to do with the generation gap between the author and today's youth.  The two main themes of loosing one's virginity and being a fish out of water somehow seem overworked.  An entertaining story, but not a \\"must-read\\".	2004-11-10

No one does this better than he does.  In this story, Charles \\"Chaz\\" Perrone thinks he has the ultimate way of ridden himself of his wife after thinking that she is about to squeal on his lucrative pollution scam that he is running for Red Hammernut.  While on a boat cruise, Chaz bumps Joey off the boat after feeding her wine for four hours and out of his life.  Heading back to shore, Chaz feels mission accomplished.  If only he realize that Joey was a former swimming champ, he may have saw some flaws to this plan.<br />Of all people to rescue Joey, here comes lonerish ex-cop Mick Stranahan.  Mick is making a return appearance in Hiassen's books.  Between Joey's crusade for revenge and nursing her back to health, the six-time divorcee Mick seems to be falling down the love trail again.<br />With a great back drop of Florida and the plot line of pollution destroying the everglades, the author has developed a wonderful and enjoyable tale that will leave you waiting impatiently for his next book.

Long on dreams and short on reality, Valerie has returned to school to get her college degree.  She meets up with two more ladies well beyond the average college student age and the three of them share a bond that only ladies in their situation could understand.<br />Valerie has got more than her fair share of problems in places she doesn't even know exist.  As she looks around she finds herself surrounded with such problems as being pressured by her mother to get married before she becomes an old maid, falling prey to a young student that awkwardly looses his virginity with her while she is only seeking someone to pay attention to her, possible suitors getting her hopes up only to thank her for being the eternal \\"friend\\" that listens to them and dealing with a troublesome child that seems to enjoy the thrill of shoplifting at the store she works.  These are some of the fronts she has to conquer.<br />By the time you finish the book, you will have enjoyed her trip through two possible marriages and a surprise finish.  Valerie suffers more than a little bit as she places the role of a little, insecure girl trapped in the body of an adult.  Torn between hiding in the comfort of her parents house and facing the world on her own, she spends many a night crying, wishing and dreaming of a happiness, yet not knowing what she really needs to be happy.<br />A sidebar story of an author spending time in her parent's bed and breakfast establishment while penning a new book called \\"BJOYFL\\" is one that will finally lead Valerie towards her true happiness.

Caldwell and Thomason first joined up when then met as 8-year-olds at a friend's birthday party.  From there on out the two became inseparable, playing on the same soccer team and writing short stories.  They shared the same passions, study in different universities, but were ultimately pulled together to author this book.<br />The result of that friendship is a book that is running above pace with \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" which is the mark for comparison on this tale.  The two 28-year-olds celebrated their university degrees by embarking on four years of writing the book.  With nothing more than a dream of success, they spent a lot of time together on laptops in Caldwell's basement in Virginia, where they once played as children.<br /><br />The early roots of this book started when they commenced working on the novel after Caldwell graduated from Princeton University and Thomason from Harvard University, in 1998. The result of their efforts is a unique blend of historical and modern day fact and fiction.  Not surprisingly, the book is focused around two Princeton seniors and their endeavors to crack the mystery of the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,&quot; a perplexing love story of unknown origins, published in Venice in 1499 and authored in multiple languages.<br />Tom tells us the tale in first person format about his and Paul adventures based on Paul's thesis about the Renaissance text.  The closer they get to its secret the more they find themselves engaged in a perilous game.  Enclosed in this plot are intellectual details, surprising twists and reflections on family, friendship and time.<br />For those that insist on comparing this to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", don't!  It is unique and deserves recognition in its own right.  Highly recommended for reading.	2004-06-04

For the most part, the stories swirl around the life of Anna Karenina, a lady that has conformed with her life.  She lives in a comfortable marriage and a boy that she loves to death.  But that safe world would quickly be turned upside down when love, the one thing that she really is missing, comes calling in the name of Count Vronsky.<br /><br />Anna is torn between what is right and what is desired.  Her desires trump righteousness and she succumbs to the yearning arms of the nobleman.  After they pursue their passion, the happily-ever-after ending seems to avoid them.  Is the Count willing to continue their relationship?  Is she truly happy with this adulterous affair or will she want more?<br />In the middle of the affair is another relationship begging to blossom.  Levin, a calm and collective farmer that has deep thought about life itself is in love with Kitty.  However, Kitty has a crush on the Count and that throws blinders on what is right in front of her.  Eventually, the story will show two types of relationships with these four characters.  Anna and Vronsky's sinfully passionate versus the path of logic of Levin and Kitty.<br />Overall, the story is one that cannot be ignored.  For better or worse, you will have to opinionate on it.  It forces you to like it or leave it.  There is no room for indifference.  I enjoyed the tale and recommend it.	2004-06-02

As the story opens up, Susan is the typical Mrs. Urban America that has the task of attempting to connect with her daughter Natalie who is in the difficult teen years where peer pressure and hopes of a first love, that may or may not exist, call her away from common sense.  If only that were the only problem she would have to deal with, she would have been happy.  However, as the story continues on, we discover that there are hidden secrets at ever corner of her life.  Secrets that she never knew or never wanted to know.  Either way, they soon start to raise their ugly heads at the least convenient of times.<br />To complicate life some, her husband has the job of his dream but it calls for him to be away from the family.  The message sent is that everything comes with a price and sacrifice.  Susan and Jeff realize this only too well as they can only enjoy their weekends together.  Unfortunately, while they attempt to fill that time with love, the conversation and attempts to resolve all the problems that have accumulated each week during his absence seem to trump everything else.  In retrospect, maybe it was always Susan's unloading on Jeff about the occurrences in her life that blocked out the problems that Jeff had to deal with during the week alone.  A middle-aged man who loves his wife dear and yearns for her company is put to the test when a young, attractive, shapely lady working as his secretary makes her intentions of looking for a good time known.  Week after week of this puts his love and faith to the test.<br />Natalie has problems of her own.

The boy shows his true colors that leaves both his friendship with his best friend as well as his relationship with her damaged.  Along the way, Natalie cannot understand why her mother can't be more understanding of her needs.

Still, Tony wasn't ready to take good over evil.  He continued life, going though a tumble into substance abuse, hollow satisfaction as head writer of National Lampoon, and a failed marriage.  All along, he struggles with himself as he attempts to find the true meaning of life.  The shadow that Father Joe had cast over him in his youth will not let his soul conform to the materialist satisfaction of the world.  Eventually, he comes to terms with what Father Joe had attempted to explain to that rebellious teenager so many years earlier and continued to patiently tell him through the years.  In the end, Hendra deserts his self-hating ways, as is the case with the ideal stories.  Tony eventually finds good over evil and embraces the ways that Father Joe unwearyingly showed him for many years.<br />The story is about Hendra and Father Joe, but has a hidden reflection on those readers that go through the same private internal war of their own.  A well-written book that will do more than just inform and entertain; it will guide you if you let it.  Highly recommended.	2004-05-21

The background story behind this book is learning from your elders.  In this particular one, we are talking about Tim Russert and how he explains the way that his father's knowledge (something that most children never appreciate until after the fact) and experience shaped his life.  We learn of Big Russ, as he refers to his father, and how he was raise in poverty, was a WWII vet with an admirable record and his ability to raise his four children and support his household while holding down two jobs for a good part of his life.  That, in itself, shows the character of Big Russ.<br />As is the dream of every parent, Russert's life is anything but representative of the suffering his father witnessed.  A wealthy lawyer, Capital Hill insider and married to a celebrity journalist, Russert is the success story his father could brag about to any and everyone.<br />The book provides a nostalgic walk through time as the author reflects on his own life as well as that of his country.  By the time you finish the book, you can understand why Big Russ earns the biggest title that any father can ever dream of.  That of being seen as a hero in his own son's eyes.  No amount of money or honors can ever top such a title as that.	2004-05-15

In this thrilling novel, he is on the trail of the murderer of colleague Terry McCaleb.  The story is intertwined with The Poet and the prime suspect is this very serial killer.  The Poet (or Bob Backus as he is called) is no typical serial killer, rather a highly trained FBI agent and mentor of another leading character in the book, Rachel Walling.  As the story unravels, The Poet has made McCaleb one of his many victims and soon sets sights on Walling.  Walling is the one helping Bosch in his investigation.  It turns out that McCaleb, the lead character from another Connelly book titled \\"Blood Work\\", was working solo in pursuit of The Poet.  Promising leads lead to his ultimate death.<br />The book is every bit as exciting and action packed with flair of the dark, intimidating atmosphere that Connelly's novels have become synonym with.  In this book, Harry Bosch is as cynical and intelligent as ever.  The action-paced story itself is a page-turner that will keep you glued until the very end, and then have you begging for more.

One has to remember no further back than when Bill ran for President the first time and she was the happy, loving Mrs. Bill Clinton who suddenly transformed into Hillary Rodham Clinton upon his election.  Despite my agreement with the author that she is marketing an artificial image for personal gain, I found this book to reach the limits of the Clinton bashing in an effort to make money.

I normally don't read books like this because on most offer problems according to personal opinions.  However, while performing research for my upcoming book on terrorism, I decided to read this for references.  After all, a good part of terrorism's success comes from manipulating the \\"Have nots\\" to perform deadly acts on the \\"Haves\\".<br />For the most part, Monbiot has captured the right ideas on how to correct the world's political wrongness, but his solutions are far-fetched.  This is no discredit to his ideas, but the reality that no world power like the USA and European nations are going to permit developing nations have a voice in their affairs.  That, in itself, explains the problem of world globalization and why history will ultimately repeat itself once more as we soon will play witness to another world power fall and others to rise.<br />One topic that isn't address is the fact that there are mafias in the poorest of countries and the reality that most of these third world countries are kept in poverty because of their own governments desire to rule their people by keeping them in need.  No matter how many steps are taken towards a world democracy, world corruption will continue to remain the largest single problem in maintaining peace on earth.  And, as I started out this review, the terrorist know this all too well.  They will continue to manipulate the needy to carry out their own devastating acts.	2004-05-01

His hidden wish was to someday be a policeman, but that never came to be.  So he followed into the firefighting world after spending his boyhood days filled with marveling at firefighters rushing to extinguish blazes in life risking manuevers.  Those impressions led him to become a firefighter with the Glendale Fire Department when he became an adult.<br />While there, he quickly climbed the ranks until he reached fire captain.  Along the way he gained the reputation of being Southern Cal's most famous and respected arson investigator as well as an author of firefighting articles which lead to a fact-based book of his own.  A rather storybook tale of a perfect life.<br />As Orr's ego grew, he needed more.  The oportunity arose when one arson continuously escape his grasps.  The arsonist, using the same simple yet devastating device, was basically terrorizing the area and his frolicing left four innocent people dead as well as destroying millions of dollars in property damage as well as the damage to nature itself.  As is often the case, this arsonist got comfortable and made a mistake after years of devastation.  One precious clue was left behind and fell into the wrong hands.  This clue would reveal the true identity of the cruel arsonist and the horrid facts behind his hobby.<br />Orr had created the fires to create fame for himself.  His ego wanted, needed the limelight and he needed a nemisis uncatchable that would keep him in the public's eye.  Sadly, his own desire for the ultimate reward was of little value in a firefighter world and beyond his grasp.  Probably acknowledging this, he created his own fame through terror.  John Orr was a firefighter that did not belong in that world.<br />The author does an excellent job on this story and tells it like it is.  The court room part is a bit longwinded and boring, but reality isn't always excitement, as John Orr himself can tell you.	2004-04-29

A happy homemaker gets a surprise package in her photo of her hubby with old college buddies.  He leaves and is kidnapped.  The happy homemaker suddenly gathers more guts and courage than originally depicted in the first part of the book as she jumps head first into finding her hubby.  Coben fans are probably thinking about now, \\"Didn't that happen in No Second Chance?\\"<br />Anyway, the happy homemaker goes through a rather deep and dark world in her journey to recover hubby and joins forces with such characters as a mobster in an attempt to find him.  From there, the plot takes so many twists and turns that you will need a map and a scorecard to keep track.  I don't know if the author felt that the simple storyline needed to be complicated or such a complicated tale needed a simple storyline.  Either way, the last pages is like a debrief as the author brings together so many loose ends.<br />I like this author, but I think he needs to take a step back and find a new direction in his storylines.  So many times, writers get caught up in the \\"if it worked once, it will work again\\" pattern.  Still, the book is enjoyable and a recommended read.	2004-04-28

The characters within the pages are memorable and demonstrate the old saying that \\"everyone is their own world\\".  In the heart of the tale is focus on the solitude that exists in some lives.  Additional points to ponder are racial justice through the eyes of a black physician that must wage his own fight after having his son jailed and misunderstanding as the various characters talk to a man that is unable to speak in John Singer.  They assume that he is deeply concern without ever really giving thought to the truth of his quite sessions of listening to them going on and on about their injustices.  Overall, the characters are seeking to air their discontent with the world while attempting to grasp the reality that has been dealt them.  A very good book and one that I would highly recommend.	2004-04-26

I would like to state here that I benefited highly from that decision.  Lisa Young has delivered a powerful novel that is fast pace and interesting.  Her style of writing is a breath of fresh air and this novel demonstrates her capacity as a great author.<br />The main character in this story is a young rookie patrol officer named Darby Jacobs.  She is currently on leave when she hears about a suicide over her scanner in her house.  The address brings back what will become a wave of memories as she attempts to discover who killed the person that treated her years ago so many year.  His death had been made a charade of a suicide.  However, Darby just knows from her own relationship with him, that he was never the type to have killed himself.  Not willing to permit this injustice, she decides that it is on her shoulders to prove him a victim of murder instead of suicide.  She is especially determined when the superior officer release the crime scene so shortly after without investigating all leads.<br />Refusing the warning of superiors to stay away, she starts her own quest in search of the truth.  The path she has to travel reveals more than she sometimes wishes to know in her hunt for the truth.  Eventually, the truth comes, but not after many different possibilities are pursued and discarded.  As this whodunit uncovers the life of the victim in search of the killer, there are surprises at every turn that leaves you begging for more when the guilty party is finally revealed.<br />The story draws you end and you start feeling that you are right there with the characters as they reflect on their past while discovering who is the murder and the motives behind it.  I hope that the story continues on as I came to want more out of Darby and Justin while watching Don tackle his own personal demons.  Lisa, don't make us suffer and get a sequel out soon!!!!!!!	2004-04-15

I was disappointed that the book wasn't longer because it was a thoroughly enjoyable story.  When I reached the end, I was happy that Lucy and Dell's suffering had ended, but I wanted more.<br />Dell is a seven-year old that suddenly finds a girl two years older than her living with her in the summer of 1962.  As a little girl that \\"doesn't know nothing about nothing\\" she quickly learns more than her little mind wants to know.  Her house is a continuous battle zone between her dysfunctional mother and her abusive boyfriend.  Lucy brings her relief as someone she can depend on to be there for her.  As the summer drags out, Dell has to come to terms with many different problems as well as worry about Lucy's health, which seems only to get worse.<br />Cindy Bell has a wonderful way of telling a tale in a style that rivals John Steinbeck.  It is an honor to have read this masterpiece and can only encourage the writer to make her debut novel the first in a collection of certain masterpieces.  Highly recommended for reading.	2004-04-06

Suddenly, former intelligence analyst Richard Clarke who spent eight years on the White House National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism on the President's National Security Council finds himself in an unique position of pointing how both a Republican and Democrat administration has failed to protect the country. He witnessed how the Clinton administration and Bush administration really just felt as if nothing was really capable of penetrating the imaginative security of the USA borders. Each had other issues at hand and viewed Al-Qaeda as a bunch of rebel rousers that could only perform acts of terrorism in the Middle East. Saddam Hussein was a proven target and an easy sale to the national public. Bin Laden, at the time, was nothing more than a footnote from the mountains of Afghanistan with little threat against the USA other than bombing embassies in African nations. <br />True to character, this book points out how Mr. Rumsfeld wanted nothing more than to launch an attack against Iraq on 12 Sept, 2001. This ideological agenda of his was hammered into the American public through Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney as they started out blasting the \\"Axis of Evil\\" accusations in the State of the Union speech in 2002. Their bases of such was Saddam's use of nerve gas against his own population years earlier which demonstrated his cold-heartedness, and thus, his ability to be in cahoots with Al Qaeda. Add a dose of noncompliance of UN resolutions and you had a sure terrorist on your hand. That logic was the selling point of preparing the war drums. <br />The only thing that I really find hard to follow is how Mr. Clarke is able to provide us a simple, relatively inexpensive national security though means such as increasing the border patrol personnel and strengthening the infrastructure. If only fighting terrorist were so simple, the world would have conquered terrorism years ago. <br />To indicate that the Bush administration has been overall unsuccessful in the fight against terrorism is not entirely true. All the foiled attempts that fade quickly from the spotlight are soon forgotten while 911 is constantly thrown in your face in the book. Overall, the book offers us a clear view that neither political party is truly committed to national security and use events for their own benefits. Much more than fighting terrorism, this books silently is yelling that we need to seriously reform our political parties. <br />The most ironic part of it all is that when Mr. Clarke was under oath and asked if there was anything that either President could have done to prevent 9-11, he answered: &quot;No.&quot;  That kind of destroys the entire content of his book.<br />Anyway, I recommend it as good reading, but remember that this is an opinionated document and shouldn't be taken as the gospel for everything it says.	2004-03-27

This comes at a price of having to pick up her Midwest life and move to the Big Apple.  Of all the jobs in New York, this Kansas transplant ends up as a dogsitter for a canine that lives better than half the New York population after lasting a mere hour at a realtors office.  Of course, this job has its perks as poor Vinnie is suddenly living in a Manhattan penthouse with an architect named Nicholas Wright.  She actually snagged the job when she saved poor Daffodil, the spoiled but funny dog, from a pond.<br />Nicholas is not that fond of the pooch, but it was an inheritance from his recently decease aunt and he feels that obligation to watch for the dog as a last act of love for her.  He is more worried about succeeding in life as his childhood memories were always filled with attention getting and he never really grew out of it.<br />With time, they actually find themselves falling for each other.  Life is good for just the three of them as they start embarking on a relationship that he sometimes attempts to retreat from with such emergency deflation tactics as envisioning Jane Reno in lingerie.<br />Unfortunately, as is always in life, a third party wants to crash their happily ever after world.  Dana Dvorak is Nicholas heartless love that schemes a plan to get rid of the spoiled Doberman Pincher and the sitter that watches the dog.<br />The story is an amusing one with Dana offering little more than sex to compete with Vinnies all around wholesomeness.  Then there are the comic relief antics of Daffodil to keep the story light.  Overall, an amusing and entertaining read.  I highly recommend this one.	2004-03-15

Once home, Aurora decides that the island where her town is located needs a park and volunteers her expertise to provide a budget to the town.  Everything runs smooth until she discovers that her budget will mean having to track down the landowners.  Had she taken the conventional route through city hall and bureaucracy, she would have missed the sparks that fly when she determines that hooking up with software genius Clay McCloud is the quickest path.<br />Clay was just sitting around, minding his own business without desiring any complications.  When this gorgeous redhead seeks his assistance, he can't help but to be intrigued.  While they don't share the same outlook for the island, they do share a hidden passion for each other that begs through the pages to be unleashed.<br />The backdrop is environmental versus development.  A supporting cast carries this story and the overall outcome is wonderful if not a tad too obvious.  The 180-degree opposite personalities of the love interests add to the passion as each wants to dominate the other.  I enjoyed the book and recommend it.	2004-03-12

Lil has the kiss of misfortune planted squarely on her life.<br />That makes her a perfect target for country and western singer, Jonathan Van Castle. Jon is a washed up performer on a comeback and comes with his own share of skeletons in the closet. Their coincidental meeting in the bookstore that Lil is packing up leads them on a relationship based partially on a need to be needed. Lil needs someone to raise her from the gloom and doom of her life while Jon needs a wife to help get custody of his two children that currently reside with their abusive mother, Belinda.<br />Belinda is a real bad lady and the author writes the role believably great, as you will quickly love to hate her. Anyway, as Jon and Lil's relationship blossoms from a state of need into authentic love, the story quickly excels into a shocking culmination as Belinda's trumps common sense as the custody hearing approaches.<br />Filled with plenty of love, revulsion, ardor, idiocy and compassion lined with a trail of lies, this tale by debut author Corgiat promises us an exciting new voice in the romance world. I, for one, welcome her work, even if it means more competition.	2004-03-10

The backdrop of the story here is banning religions to prevent war.  A great concept on paper, but there seems to be a lacking of what religion means to many.  Religion is the inspiration to believe in something more than what we have in front of our eyes.  Keeping that in mind, let's focus on what is the life of Paul Stepola.  Here we have a man assigned the task of running the NPO (National Peacekeeping Organization).  In his attempt to enforce the law, he is exposed to supernatural phenomenon that the underworld call miracles and the disbelievers call conspiracy.  The story leads up to a pending event that is on course.  It is an event that the believers warn of and the law is determined to disprove the revelation.  A wonderful story that I recommend as it gives a daring view on how man, out of desperation, will attempt to do just about anything for peace.

Just to drive the interest up a notch, the upcoming economic summit will surely be the idea target for \\"August Spies\\".<br />James Patterson is noted for fast-paced tales with twist and turns.  However, some of the small points in the story just seemed to be thrown in with little reasoning because the writer appeared to run out of ideas to justify them.  This doesn't affect the overall story, but it is a tad disturbing and something I hope the author leans away from in future projects.  Still a recommended read.	2004-03-05

He is a man that has a new job with the FBI that may very well be the most challenging and compromising of his career.  Oddly enough, his family seems to be in some terrible danger.  How can a man concentrate on a team of kidnappers that are picking up high standing people for a possible sell into slavery when the mother of his son wants to drag him into a custody dispute?  Not to worry, Patterson takes this tale to new levels with fast paced action as he moves Cross through the entire scenario without getting bogged down in the small stuff.<br />However, the mysterious Wolf is just a little too farfetched to carry on with.  Former KGB men now need to turn to mobsters in an attempt to make a living.  For me there were some loose ends on this angle that needed addressing.  Hopefully we will not be strung out on this one, as the series is sure to continue.  Recommended reading for those that enjoy the Alex Cross series.	2004-03-05

Enter Willie Traynor, a college dropout that stuns the local community with his quest to raise the newspaper from its ashes.  This is soon accomplished with his daring editorial efforts and his coverage of a sadistic rape and murder that has been pinned on the town's secluded bootlegger family.  Despite the influence of the Padgitt family in the community, Danny is sent to life in prison.  Many viewed this as a tradeoff from the death penalty that he deserved, but regardless the community soon places the crime and the guilty party behind them as they move on with life.<br />Nine years later, Danny's life sentence receives a parole.  During this time, Traynor learns to adapt in a town known for unique characters and lack of trust from outsiders.  When Danny is once again a free person, Traynor has more than his hands full to report on as jury members are turning up dead.<br />True to Grisham's roots, this book returns to court action that made Grisham a household name.  However, there are shades of the sentiment side he has recently displayed in such recent greats like Bleachers.  If you like Grisham's work you are going to love this book!!!	2004-02-29

Andrew Breitbart and Mark Ebner's come across with this book in one message: \\"Get rich quick!\\"  If the idea of providing the reading public with a book about the almost satanic ways of celebrities was their goal, they failed miserably.  Most of the information is not new and when you come across some previously unknown information, it is presented in such an impartial matter that you can't help but to think that they were forcing a slam on someone for their own benefits.<br />I really believe that Breitbart and Ebner would have been more productive hawking nuclear power to the Sierra Club than attempting to educate the reading public about the secret lives of famous celebrities.  If they wanted to spill the dirt on them, they needed to find new material and present it totally impartially.  Their desperate attempt to let us in on these secrets comes across as a desperate attempt for them to make names for themselves.  They provide us with such earth-stopping news like Nick Nolte and Robert Downey Jr. having drug problems.  Now there is news that we never would have known if it hadn't been for this book.<br />Even if half of the stuff here were true, they have made it unbelievable with their delivery and the chip that they carry on their shoulder through the entire book.  The best example of this is when they describe gay porn director Paul Barresi's attempt to blackmail Michael Jackson \\"a code of ethics emphasizing loyalty and respect\\".  Likewise, Mr. Breitbart and Mr. Ebner should be noted for displaying their \\"code of ethics emphasizing loyalty and respect\\" from their Hollywood connections and providing it to the reader.	2004-02-27

I thank that person for doing so.<br />Eddie is a 83-year-old maintenance man that most would probably never see in our world these days.  The type that is too unimportant to get rid of.  But, as his death quickly overtakes him, we are shown how this forgotten old man was such a grand figure.  It makes one think about people that they see everyday without really knowing anything about them.<br />Anyway, we are then told how Eddie was and something about his life as it changes from birthday to birthday.  Finally, we follow Eddie into heaven where five instrumental figures from his moral life appear.  He is ultimately surprised at the influence he had on each of these people as they demonstrate the true value he had in their lives.<br />When you finish this book you will find that the old maintenance man from Ruby Pier was much more than he ever gave himself credit and it makes you reflect on how all of our lives our interconnected with each other somehow.

After reading The Da Vinci Code, I decided to check out some previous material by this author.  This had a double benefit.  The first was that this book, much like the Da Vinci Code, addresses such issues as a secret brotherhood, dabbles in religion, depicts crazed authoritative historical figures, amongst other things.  This provided, yet another entertaining tale in the style of the Da Vinci Code.  Had I not read the Da Vinci Code, I would never had thought to read this one.<br />The second benefit was that I actually enjoyed this book more.  Maybe it was because Da Vicini Code had so much hype while this was more unassuming.  Either way, I was more pleased with the story because it was presented as the fictional entertainment that the author wanted it to be.  (Or was it?)<br />To make it short, Angels and Demons is another story that demonstrates the author's ability to write a well-researched tale in the religious sector.	2004-02-12
