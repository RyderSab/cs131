Mel, a perennial student (and hopeful NSA operative), has a passion for ciphers and cryptology, so she is up to the challenge, especially since Sydney Bristow is her heroine. She initially ignores the invitation to the game when it proclaims that she has to \\"play or die\\", and she wants no part of the sick game.<br /><br />Matthew Stryker, a former marine is assigned as her \\"protector.\\" At first she does not believe what he is telling her when he tries to explain the game to her. He knows all too well how serious it is, since a few months ago, he ignored the clues, and as a result, another women who did not play the game was found dead. Together, Mel and Stryker travel all over Manhaten trying to solve a series of clues and puzzles to elude her assassin Lynx and complete the game. But the assassin has raised the stakes by murdering Mel's former lover. Adding complications is the growing attraction between Mel and Stryker as they race the clock to beat Lynx at his own game.<br /><br />The story is fast-paced and the writing is witty. The only thing that turned me off is that the protagonist was the stereotypical post-Sex in the City single with a designer clothing and shoe fetish. It gets old after awhile that every chicklit heroine seems to have this annoying attribute. Other than that, it is a great story with a punny premise loosely mirroring the infamous \\"Da Vinci Code\\" right down to the clever book cover. Defnintely a great way to wile away the afternoon!	2005-10-05

Sent away at the age of 14 because her obsessive love for Riely Whitefield resulted in all kinds of havoc, Gracie has been asked by her mother and sisters to return home to plan her sister Vivian's wedding. It turns out that the reason they appeared to invite her is for one of her famous wedding cake creations at no charge. Gracie, now living in LA is the wedding cake maker to the stars; the Vera Wang of the cake set. When her sister Alexis asks her to help spy on her husband because she suspects he's unfaithful, Gracie reluctantly agrees, particularly since it entails spying on the house of Riley. Zeke is Riley's mayoral campaign manager. Riley has a vengeful uncle who makes his winning the election a condition of his inheritance of $97 million. His plans are to win but not serve. When they literally bump into each other, she confesses to Riley why she's there, and he agrees to help her solve the mystery to ensure hsi chances for winning are not curtailed. Soon he wonders why he resisted her all the years ago. As Riley's popularity in the poles increase (thanks to a suggestive picture and a reprinting of \\"The Gracie Chronicles,\\" highlighting her past transgressions), he and Gracie continue to investigate. But the current mayor will do anything to get reelected, and he and his mistress (who has link to both Riley and Gracie) try to embarrass Riley and Gracie at every turn. But when her livelihood is threatened, Gracie is out for blood.<br /><br />The story is refreshing and more than a mystery/romance. The family dynamics of the Landon women could be a book in and of itself, and the nosy townspeople would make anyone happy to live an anonymous life in a big city. While the bad guys are no mystery, getting there is so much fun!	2005-10-03

She hasn't quite been accepted by them, but when the queen bee invites her to lunch, she's so excited, but unfortunately finds her hostess face down in her kitchen in a pool of blood, with a butcher knife in her back. Kate's boredom results in her taking a crack at solving the murder. After all, the keystone cops cannot seem to figure out a motive or any suspects. She discovers that she and Kitty had a friend in common, Evan McKenna, a NY investigator who also happens to be a former lover she hasn't seen since an embarrassing incident that caused her to from New York and into the arms of her husband Ben. Ben wants Kate to leave the sleuthing to the authorities, while Kate just wants something to do three days a week while the kids are at school. With the help of Evan and her best bud Janie (who has the best lines!), Kate discovers that all is not well in tight-knit Upchurch, and there are plenty of secrets that people want to keep buried.<br /><br />\\"Goodnight Nobody\\" is a dramatic change from Weiner's regular writing style. But her excellent storytelling and funny narrative kept me hooked. She is at her best when she writes about relationships, but I felt that the two men in her life were not completely drawn out. There were far too many things left unresolved too and since Weiner does not write sequels, the reader is left to wonder.	2005-10-03

He is still nursing a career ending leg injury and an unrequited love (lasting just over 10 years) for the daughter of his former mentor. His feelings are made even more complicated by the fact that he helped to put her father behind bars. He keeps track of Erin, but does not want to complicate her life, so he stands in the shadows to insure her safety.<br /><br />When Connor discovers that his nemesis, Kurt Novak and his rapist henchman Georg Luksh have escaped from prison, he goes into full protection mode and tries to convince Erin of the possible danger. He insists on accompanying her to a meeting with a client in Portland, and makes an ass of himself in front of her client. Does she dump him? Of course not; she burns the sheets with him for the next 45 pages instead. The relationship starts out tender and soon evolves into erotic obsession, as the two search for her missing sister and try to get assist her very depressed mother.<br /><br />In \\"Behind Closed Doors,\\" Connor seemed so sensitive and earnest, and was a very likeable character. In \\"Shadows,\\" he is completely fixated with dominating Erin, particularly sexually. I agree with other readers that the plot is basically a rehash with unintelligent heroines and heroes that need to keep their pants zipped once in awhile. There were far too many gratuitous love scenes, and not enough of a plot, despite being nearly 500 pages! While the two books can stand alone, it is best if you read its predecessor first, so you can understand what makes Novak such a villain.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Shannon McKenna story that blends erotic romance with a storyline, check out \\"Return to Me.\\"	2005-10-03

When he discovers that it is not her, he sets a chain of events in motion to find out where she is and to finally profess his love. Max was finally successful in driving her away 17 moths earlier with his fears about their age difference, and Gina left him to join relief workers in Africa with her friend Molly (who was introduced in \\"Out of Control\\"). It appears that Gina was in Berlin to acquire a passport for Molly's husband, Grady Morant, who is an Army deserter turned former Asian drug lord's lackey.<br /><br />When Jules, Grady, and Max reluctantly join forces to find the women, they are taken on a whirlwind trip all the way to Asia. But what appears to be a simple case of kidnapping leaves more questions than answers, particularly the motivations of the man who spirited the ladies away from Germany.<br /><br />Missing from the story is the passion between the two couples. In previous stories, both couples burned up the pages; in this one, the romance is lukewarm at best. Also suspiciously absent from the story are members of SEAL Team 16 and the Troubleshooters, which have always been the reason to read Brockmann novels. As always, the saving grace was Jules to provide the comic relief. Unfortunately, he is absent for most of the book.<br /><br />I wanted to love this book, particularly to find out how Max and Gina's love story progresses. Unfortunately, the writing was a bit clunky, mostly due to the constant jumping around in time. The plot was somewhat boring (or at least not well executed), and could have been tightened. I would have preferred a story told in chronological order, rather than the constant skipping. Once Brockmann chose the present to write about, the clunkiness subsided. As disappointing as the story was, it still held my attention, and with the time invested in the relationships already, I wanted to see them through to the end.ted in the relationships already, I wanted to see them through to the end.	2005-10-03

He pegs her as a novice and decides to try to help her.<br /><br />Along the way, they embark on a passionate affair. Jake tries to resist anything more than a sexual relationship as he is fighting the demons that led to the loss of his wife, while Stephanie is finding herself falling deeper in love with a man who cannot commit.

He allows her to bunk on his couch and generally looks out for her, while trying to encourage her to return to her family.<br /><br />It is a very interesting storyline, and the lead characters have so much chemistry dripping off the page. But the plot surrounding Shondra is kinda clunky and does not really add much to the storyline (other than to make Jake even more of a hero). Overall, the story was a bit predictable, but still enjoyable.	2005-09-26

The first born, Faith has always been first in the eyes of their parents. The two sisters are so close that they marry two guys that are best friends. After several years together, Isabel gives husband Will an ultimatum - she wants to start the family that he continues to put off, or she will leave him. Will then confesses that not only he is having an affair (again), but he fathered a child with his mistress. To Isabel's horror, the mistress was Faith, and the relationship lasted at least 3 years.<br /><br />Three months after leaving Will, Isabel is attending Faith and Will's funeral. The deceptive duo bundled up baby Tony, and were killed in a car crash. The only one to survive was baby Tony, who is now being raised by the only father he has ever known, Ben.<br /><br />Ben discovered the truth when searching for clothing to bring to the funeral home; he comes across Faith's Dear John letter admitting that Tony is not his child. Ben is terrified that he might lose his son, and enlists Isabel's help to keep the truth from her parents, who cling to anything having to do with Faith.<br /><br />Ben tries to use guilt first to get Isabel on his side, since she has had 3 months to recover from their spouses' infidelity, while he is still shell-shocked. Soon, the two are sharing close quarters, and starting to feel an attraction to each other. Is it just their way to get even with their cheating partners, or is Ben trying to seduce Isabel to get her to side with him? Isabel never feels like she can trust him or her own distrust after having her heart shattered by Will and Faith.<br /><br />Tensions, sibling rivalry, unresolved feelings, deception, and some pretty ballsy in-laws help to progress the melodramatic story. I thought at times it just bogged down so much with Ben and Isabel arguing about whether to tell her parents or not.

In a nutshell, we have Will Moreland, a New York therapist who has elected to go to his college reunion. His wife Carole prefers to stay home since she does not know anyone and they are still feeling the emotional tug of the loss of their son, Luke. During the reunion, most people are more concerned with the whereabouts of his twin brother Mitch, a pretty famous long-distance swimmer, whom Will is estranged. After reading about some of his former collegiates, he comes across the bio of former flame Elizabeth and discovers that she has a daughter that could possibly be his. When he asks her, she justifiably balks at him.<br /><br />He returns home, and seeks out a therapist of his own to discuss his intimacy issues with his wife, as well as his dark sexual fantasies, as they are starting to interfere with his effectiveness at his own practice. He is also having problems with the abandonment of his twin, who he has not seen since his wedding day. Mitch was born with birthmark that made him stand out to ridicule as a child. Will always felt guilt that his own face was not marred. Little does he know that the brother that he protected since childhood made a mockery of his devotion, as he slowly learns the truth behind Mitch's absence.<br /><br />A new patient arrives in his office with her own intimacy issues. She is a student and seduces older men. When she relishes in telling him about her sex life in detail, it is evident that her next victim is going to be Will. After she makes an inappropriate move on him, he decides to terminate their relationship and refers her elsewhere. Soon, she is knocking down his door, insisting that he see her. When she disrobes, Will's own lack of willpower triggers a sexual escapade which he will forever wish did not happen, particularly when the patient reveals who she is.<br /><br />Suddenly Will questions is own relationship with his wife, former lovers, his brother, and his parents.

Will Luke make up with his father and get the rest of his inheritance back? Do people really buy economy-sized boxes of Ding Dongs?<br /><br />While at times the storyline is humorous, I expected a lot more, particularly after \\"Perfect Together.\\" In a way, this book seemed like a step back, and was missing the chemistry and magic that made that book so fun to read.

She shares the airwaves with Matt Ransom, the station's night talk jock who appeals to the more masculine crowd. Unbeknownst to the station personnel, she and Matt share a torrid past that neither of them wants to discuss, and Olivia wants nothing to do with a guy similar to the one she just rid of.<br /><br />When the station management decides that they can only afford one of the talk jocks, a competition is devised - the two will share cramped quarters a la \\"Big Brother\\" and report from the apartment, while the room is wired for video for the web crowd. Neither realizes how difficult the next week will be, with all the pent up tension between the two.<br /><br />When the week is up, the aftermath of their captivity changes each of their lives.  For Matt, being stuck is for a week with a psychologist meant discussing things he never wanted to think about; for Olivia it meant coming to terms with her feelings about her divorce, Matt, and what she wants for her own future.<br /><br />The two are counseling a couple (JoBeth wants to marry; Dawg was burned by his ex-wife), giving their own form of advice that at times is poignant, and other times is hysterical (particularly when they exchange audiences for one day). As Matt and Olivia change, the advice they give this couple changes.<br /><br />This is Wax's debut contemporary romance. It has a good storyline, with a great premise. It is choppy at times, but thankfully it has pretty snappy dialogue, and the bantering between the two leads is great. Wax's follow up novel, \\"Leave it to Cleavage\\" cements her position as a great contemporary storyteller in the vein of Jennifer Crusie.	2005-09-14

Jesse Chapman is the bad boy of golf and he is back in El Paso to shy away from the limelight while gearing up for his next PGA match after being touted as a hero for \\"rescuing\\" a fan. He appears to have lost his edge (you know, in an edgy golfer sort of way).<br /><br />When he is thrust back into Kate's world, staying in the guest house of all places, the two find themselves in \\"too close for comfort\\" proximity. Will she open her heart once again to the father of all heartbreakers? Will he let his guard down enough to let the one woman who can make a difference inside?<br /><br />Interlaced with funny emails that assist in setting the tone and advancing the storyline, the plot trudges along at a quick pace.

The only thing she has left of him besides a mountain of debt is the station (which she had to sell), her mansion (which she plans to sell), and a wild rose bush he gave her years ago.<br /><br />While Ben Prescott, an undercover cop is recuperating from a gun shot wound, Julia offers to take him in so his brother and sister-in-law can go one their honeymoon. Julia, tired of her \\"good time girl\\" reputation, decides to become more demure. But that is not easy when you have a veritable \\"Petri dish of testosterone\\" sleeping down the hall. Ben is laying low trying to find out who murdered his partner, finding himself trapped in close quarters with a Donna Reed wanna-be. But every time they are alone, Ben manages to glimpse the old Julia, and tries to break through her facade. Julia is worried that \\"import/export\\" guy she has let into her home is really a drug dealer.<br /><br />When Julia starts working on a new reality makeover show, Ben helps her find a contestant, so she will quit asking him to be her guinea pig. As she films her show, he keeps showing up, mostly out of jealousy of her chosen \\"primal guy.\\" Being so close to each other eventually leads to plenty of steam between the two, as they come to terms with who they really are and what they both want out of life.<br /><br />Lee is always manages to make her characters realistic even when they are thrown into unrealistic situations. Her dialogue is always crisp and witty, and not at all melodramatic like so many romance novelists who apparently own the same thesaurus. \\"Simply Sexy\\" is a great (but unfortunate) end to the trilogy. Though each can definitely stand on their own as a single story, you won't be disappointed if you take the time to read all three.	2005-09-14

There is not much in her life that she has passion for, other than her church and pastor, Father Brendon Quinlan.<br /><br />When a fellow parishioner is found murdered and crucified on Saint Simeon's altar just before the Easter vigil, and it is revealed that the victim was gay, all eyes suddenly are thrust on Father Brendon. His only real ally is Chloe, who stands by him, while his local diocese tries to find evidence to have him removed.<br /><br />Detective Matt Diel is Chloe's former partner. He still has feelings for her, despite her icy persona, but has never managed to break through her chilly facade. He agrees with Chloe that the murder appears to be a set up, and asks that they work together on it. As they unravel the clues, and discover Father Brendon's implication in a suicide of a young gay soldier while he was in the Navy, it appears that Brendon is the target of a sinister and far-reaching plot.<br /><br />While the suspense of the story was good, I was really disappointed with the lack of romance, as well as the incomplete conclusion. I felt like something was missing - was there a book prior... one later that follows up with the characters? I just felt a bit cheated since it is touted as romantic suspense.	2005-09-12

Her roommate Miles gets her hooked up with his cousin Fabio's PI business. Soon, Pauline is a fraud investigator, and her first perp is a former nursing school chum, who has bilked $34K from workman's comp. It's pretty obvious from the start that Pauline doesn't know what the heck she's doing. On her first stake out, she brings along the largest video camera made in the mid-80's and a camera with 2 pictures left. As she is parked right in front of the fraud's house, a mysterious neighbor in an SUV that confronts her and then calls the cops. She might as well shine a spot light on herself, she's so obviously inept.<br /><br />Realizing she sucks at this, she gets some help from transvestite PI Goldie. He shows her the ropes and while having coffee at a clinic, comes face to face with the SUV guy. Turns out his name is Jagger, and he's an investigator of some kind, though no one seems to know much about him or who he works for. He makes a bargain with Pauline - if she works undercover at the clinic, he'll share in the reward. Turns out the clinic may be crooked. Soon bodies are turning up and Pauline's scared but with Jagger covering her back she's got nothing to worry about, right?<br /><br />I thought that the story was pretty funny, and looked forward to some romance for Pauline with either Nick or Jagger, since Vance was not floating her boat, but it never materialzied. Pauline was pretty annoying at times - particularly with all her annoying \\"ACKing\\" throughout the book (this got old quickly), as well as the constant inner-dialgue.

Not knowing where they can turn or who they can trust, while determining if the ultimate goal they have always proclaimed that they want is indeed what they want.<br /><br />Westy is a breath of fresh air in this one - his reactions and trying to control his humor at Luther's expense is priceless.

She's shocked when John announces that he not only is having an affair, but wants a divorce. Let pretty much penniless since he snuck all the assets out of the marriage, the only thing she has left is her childhood home, which was willed to her by her grandmother. She packs up all her belongings, as well as her best friend with the goal of turning said home into a B&B. Upon arrival, she meets up with the boy her took her virginity and broke her heart. Matt Converse, former long-haired, hell-raising, motorcycle-riding bad boy, is now the responsible town sheriff and \\"mother\\" to his three younger sisters (but still has that cycle). At first, they are antagonistic, but soon, when a burglar and a possible killer seem to have targeted her, she runs into his open arms. Of course, he makes it plain that he has no intention of a happily ever after that includes a wife, so they agree to a no-strings affair, which soon has both of them wondering what they were thinking, and the rest of the town hot and bothered when they keep catching them in compromising situations.<br /><br />I typically eat up any story by Karen Robards. \\"Whispers at Midnight\\" was a hard one to get into for the first 200 pages or so. The first ten pages encompass a week; the next 190 or so are a span of a couple hours; far too much detail and little action. But once the story gets going, it does not let up. There's little mystery; the killer is kinda obvious, but once you make that hurdle over those first 200 pages, the action really starts heating up, and is non-stop until the last page. One of the highlights of the book is the relationship between Matt and his sisters - he is hopelessly whipped! Maybe a little condensing could have been done (the paperback is nearly 500 pages) to make it a tighter story.	2005-09-12

This is the first time that she and Tom have seen each other in over a decade, and the old sparks are still there.

The resort is full of clich&eacute;d characters - the tennis instructor/resort lothario, the clingy nerd, cheerleader tour guides, and of course lipstick lesbians that like to put on a show.<br /><br />The opening scene is hysterical - her friends have put something in her luggage which sets off the security. Unfortunately, that is really the only funny scene; the rest of the book just meanders along. While in Turkey, the girls seem to keep getting stuck with another Brit couple - Marcus and Sally, who are on the verge of divorce. Sally is such a pill, that I found it hard to understand why Marcus would want to stay with such a shrew.<br /><br />Each woman has a problem that needs resolution - Rachel hates confrontation, and the mother-in-law from hell runs all over her. Carrie Ann is trying to lie under the radar, but every inappropriate male seems to have latched onto her, while her only solace is playing chess with brainy Frenchman, Axel. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out Yaslyn's problem, what with all the barfing - despite having a man pining for her back home and ready to make a commitment, she laps up all the male attention she receives, including the tennis instructor, Gilles.<br /><br />There really was not a lot offered in the book to hold my attention. Perhaps there were too many characters; perhaps none of the \\"problems\\" were serious enough to capture your attention... I was pretty disappointed with this after the great cover description. All in all - I think that this was a pretty forgettable novel.	2005-09-09

Unfortunately, it is long and drawn out, and not what a lot of us were hoping for.<br /><br />There's so much going on in the plot - too much in fact. Sam's grisly discovery of a body in his wife's house; his daughter is missing and he is the chief suspect; background from Sam's childhood (where we discover that is his favorite four letter word became a staple in his vocabulary quite early.<br /><br />Other key plot points: an unlikely (and very undeveloped) sub-story where SEAL team leader Tom Paoletti stands accused of aiding the terrorists, because the guns used are ones he reported \\"scuttled\\"; Tom finally marries lady love Kelly in a shotgun-like ceremony; Kelly is a victim of the terrorists; Max finally succumbs to his temptation for former hostage (and much younger) Gina; the burgeoning relationship between Mary Lou and a man of color comes to fruition; the romance of Sam's best friend's grandparent's WWII romance is played out; and Jules is around to give the occasional line of comic relief.<br /><br />All in all, there is just too much, which makes it a bit of a disappointment. The paperback version of the book trudges on for over 500 pages; and the story really stalls in the middle. Without a doubt, the most exciting part of the book is the last 80 pages. Verdict - less time with Sam's past and the WWII back story, and more time with the guys that make this series so great - the Troubleshooters. This time out, they were basically window dressing, relegated to playing an insignificant role.	2005-08-31

The second in the SEAL Team Sixteen series, \\"The Defiant Hero,\\" manages to capture and maintain tension and action-packed suspense with each turn of the page. The characters literally jump from the page to capture your attention.<br /><br />Widow Meg Moore is forced by terrorists to kidnap a foreign national in exchange for her daughter and grandmother, who they are holding captive.  Knowing that it is a hopeless situation, Meg tells the hostage negotiators that the only negotiator she will even consider talking to is John Nilsson, a Navy SEAL that she met while on a foreign assignment. John has carried a torch for Meg for many years, but has not acted on his feelings since she was married at the time.<br /><br />No one is more surprised than John when he is called to negotiate. The Meg he remembers would never do anything so suicidal. A linguistics expert, the two manage to communicate via a language no one else recognizes, and she reveals the fate of her family. When all is not what it appears, and Meg spirits away her prey to barter for her family, John is quickly on her tail, trying to win her trust and help her out of the mess.<br /><br />\\"The Defiant Hero\\" also marks the consummation of the love-hate relationship between SEAL Lt. Sam Starrett and FBI Agent Alyssa Locke, which plays out over the next several installments in the series. This relationship is so complex, it is no wonder that it plays out over several books.<br /><br />I could have lived without reading the third romance - a WWII flashback involving Meg's grandmother.  These WWII flashbacks appear to be a recurring theme in several of the SEAL Sixteen books. After this one, I tended to skip the flashbacks in all later books, since they did little to move the plot along.	2005-08-29

Dashing Lt. Mike Muldoon is assigned to show her around, and they instantly start flirting.<br /><br />Mike is not really at finessing with the ladies. Though he spent his youth as a self-described \\"fat math geek,\\" he definitely grew out of the phase. The major stumbling blocks in their romance is the 7-year age gap. She is afraid to date a 25 year old guy, but has no problem setting him up with the president's troubled 40-year old daughter. The whole age gap thing was kind of beaten to death in Meg & Nilsson's story, \\"The Defiant Hero.\\"<br /><br />Muldoon tries his nest to pursue the elusive Joan, and at one point, this reader thought why bother? As a heroine, Joan just did not jump off that page - she was a bit bland. We had to wait so long for them to get together, that it was not too satisfying. I thought Mike deserved better.<br /><br />Further adding to the plot is the growing friendship between FBI agent Alyssa Locke and her box, hostage negotiator Max Bhagat. It is misinterpreted as a romance by Sam's team, and Alyssa and Max perpetuate it to force Sam to keep his distance, since he chose a loveless marriage over the supposed love of his life.<br /><br />The thing that saved this book for me was the terrorist plot to assassinate the president. Unfortunately, it was so secondary, that it really only garners a handful of pages. Sam's wife Mary Lou plays a significant yet unwitting role in the plot, and she slowly starts to melt away at her own prejudices when she falls for an Arabic gardener.<br /><br />While it kept my attention the whole time (okay, except for those grueling WWII passages), this was not one of my favorite SEAL novels.	2005-08-29

After fixing Savannah's tire, he invites her to his place, and they fall into bed. During pillow talk, she asks him to go to Indonesia with her. When his request for leave comes in (he wants to spend a week in bed with her), he is shocked to discover that not only is she serious about Indonesia, but she is a friend of his ex, the much talked about and forever unfaithful Arlene. At first feeling betrayed, he does not want her going there alone.<br /><br />Upon arriving in Jakarta, he discovers that they are not there for fun in the sun. Her uncle has been kidnapped, and they suitcase she is carrying contains the ransom. They must use their wits, and Ken's training as a seal when they outsmart the kidnappers, and find themselves trapped in the jungle, and the subject of a manhunt from revolutionaries and drug runners. While recuperating at a village, they run into some missionaries, and get assistance. But one of the village inhabitants has a shaded past, and his misdeeds will put Savannah and Ken in danger.<br /><br />While a great adventure tale in and of its own, this one really does not spend a whole lot of time with any of the other SEALs, but nevertheless, it is a rollicking romance. We always knew that Ken was a funny guy, and his one liners (especially when being interviewed by the media) are priceless.<br /><br />The unresolved relationship between missionary Molly and Grady \\"Dave Jones\\" Morant is further developed in Brockmann's latest, \\"Breaking Point\\" (which also features more of FBI hostage negotiator Max and his much younger love, Gina). Other characters like Jules and Alyssa just seem to be thrown in for background, and don't really have a role other than to provide tension between Alyssa and her now-married lover Sam Starrett.	2005-08-29

The Saltwater Cowboys are at it again, as they are charged with the rescue of 120 passengers on-board a hi-jacked plane which is forced to land in Kazbekistan. Joining the SEAL team in the covert operation is FBI hostage negotiator Max, agents Jules Cassidy (who merely is window dressing again) and Alyssa Locke, who continues her tortured romance with Lt. Sam Starrett., and Reserve shopper pilot Teri Howe.<br /><br />This time out, it is crusty Senior Chief Stan Wolchonok who gets the love interest, though he tries numerous times to blow it by setting her up with hunky Lt. Mike Muldoon. Teri Howe is the pursuer, while Stan tries to steer clear of the whole enlisted verses office fraternization rule (which does not apply to reservists). Each step Stan tries to take away from her, she takes two steps forward. It is nice to see the least romantic of the SEALs show his softer side.<br /><br />This one is fraught with so much tension and a pretty harrowing assault of one of the passengers (as the negotiation team has to sit by and watch and listen in abject horror). Negotiator Max wrestles with his growing feelings for the hostage, who is nearly 20 years his junior, and his inability to save her in time.<br /><br />One thing I can do without is the WWII junk. I just skip over that stuff. It does not add anything to the story line other than additional pages. I like when they use an alternate font so that skipping is even easier!<br /><br />I usually do not like serial books, but this particular series manages to make each book stand on their own merits. You really get to like the characters, and they pop up all over the series, but it is not a forced inclusion like some of the other stories I have read. I look forward to each new installment.	2005-08-29

A month long affair resulted in the birth of his son. Rick is elated about settling down with his new family, but tragedy strikes, and he is killed in a car accident. His family wants baby Christopher, and is willing to pay 7 figures to get Carly out of their lives. Instead, she flees and starts over.<br /><br />Rick's best friend, PI Jake Montgomery has searched for 6 years for \\"Caroline\\" (the name that everyone knew her by) and Christopher. A chance sighting of a painting similar to one he owns in a magazine, painted by Caroline, brings him to Twilight Cove, a seaside community where Carly has started over. He wants to reunite Christopher with his grandmother, not knowing the real reason Carly fled.<br /><br />Rick is soon smitten with Carly when he discovers that she is not the trashy gold digger Rick's parents made her out to be, and hides his identity, which only makes matter worse when Carly is ready to return his feelings. He also falls for the town, and buys a fixer upper with the intention of getting to know Carly better.<br /><br />Torn between his emerging feelings for Carly and Chris, and his sense of betrayal to Rick, he keeps his findings a secret from Rick's now-widowed mother, who has suspicions of her own and has him followed on a trip to Twilight Cove. Soon, Carly is served with a custody suit, and discovers what the real meaning of family can mean to someone who thought they were alone in the world.<br /><br />What could have been the typical movie of the week plot is handled sensitively and the characters come alive on the page. This is the first in a trilogy of books, with Heat Wave and Heartbreak Hotel to follow. If Lover's Lane is any indication of the quality of the series, I surely won't miss them.	2005-08-26

At first she's against it, but a burgeoning attraction to by-the-book Cosmo Richter soon has her singing a different tune - especially when someone takes a shot at her. Sharing the spotlight is Jules Cassidy, a charismatic FBI agent (usually banished to the background), who hasn't been in a relationship since his lover, aspiring actor Adam stepped out on him one time too many. Further complicating Jules' life is a growing attraction to Jane's brother, alcoholic heartthrob actor Robin Chadwick. Robin is so deep in the closet that he doesn't understand his feelings toward the captivating Jules, which just sends him further into the bottle.<br /><br />Make no doubt about it; the book starts out as romance between Jane and Cosmo. But soon the more compelling triangle of Jules-Adam-Robin heats up the story, giving it heart and soul, particularly when Adam is cast as Robin's lover in the movie, much to Jules' chagrin. Brockmann portrays the triangle with such sensitivity and compassion, that the reader is swept away with her character development and their own imagination to the point that you really care about the characters, flaws and all, regardless of their sexual orientation. When it comes to fast-paced SEAL action, no romantic suspense writer surpasses Brockmann.	2005-08-25

After having her heart broken by Noah at her 18th birthday, she turned her back on Hollywood, returned to her hometown in Missouri, and married her longtime beau, Mark. Now a widow 16 years later, she is raising their son Trey, and reluctantly agrees to appear in a play written by her sister Jolie, hoping to heal age old scars.<br /><br />Down on his luck after losing everything and ready to end it all, with the last 2 decades being a drunken blur, Noah has made a deal with the Devil herself in order to regain his life. Lindsey's mother Vivienne Varner is the consummate stage mother and agent. Like a mafia don, she makes Noah an offer he cannot refuse - appear in a reunion play along with his former co-star to generate publicity and help reclaim his career.<br /><br />It is pretty obvious from Lindsey's reaction when he arrives at the theater that she was not aware. Scheming Jolie seems to be in cahoots with Vivienne, who is bankrolling the project. Jolie is still sore that mama Viv abandoned her when the bright lights of Hollywood beckoned Lindsey. Jolie has spent most of her life alienating her sister and her extended family as a result.<br /><br />Initially standoffish at having to share the stage with Noah, Lindsey relents, and as the two get reacquainted and start rehearsing their lines, old feelings start to surface, as Noah's fuzzy memories of his drunken youth reveal things he is not sure are real, and Lindsey tries to keep her heart from breaking a second time. They work together to get even with Viv and Jolie for interfering in their lives.<br /><br />\\"Return Engagement\\" is a charming second chance at love story. You pretty much see the plot revelation coming a mile away, but the ride getting there is so enjoyable.

She is about to make her dreams come true when she is assigned to make a merger between her company and a rival software firm come to fruition.<br /><br />The only thing blocking her success is sexy co-owner Simon Brant, who is more at home in a lab than an office. He is so dedicated to his work, that he often leaves a room mid-sentence if an idea regarding one of his experiments pops into his head. After being stalled in merger talks with him numerous times, his sarcastic butler jokingly tells her she should move in to his home. So she does, and attempts to sell Simon on the merger.<br /><br />When her boss tells her to sell Simon on the merger using her feminine wiles if necessary, she shudders. But soon the two are burning up the sheets. She is falling in love; he is not sure what is happening with him, but he does not want her to leave, so he stalls any talk of the merger. When her ex-husband is brought in to close the deal, all bets are off.<br /><br />\\"The Real Deal\\" is a captivating and sensual story featuring two engaging characters with wounded souls who somehow find each other. Amanda is a great combination of confidence, with self-esteem issues. Her painful marriage has turned her off men, and has made her feel that she is the inadequate one. I like how Simon feeds her delicate ego as he comes to terms with his own feelings. Simon is a sexy heartthrob with a big heart.

Her entire childhood was spent obtaining hand me down clothes and toys. She's especially despondent over the naked, hairless, one-armed Malibu Barbie she inherited oh so long ago, that continues to be the bane of her existence. In adulthood, she has an aversion to anything not new. She won't even eat a bag of chips at dad's house if it's already open. Unsatisfied with her current relationship with Rip, but willing to stick it out so she's not alone, she runs into Charlotte's high school beau, Ian. She had a secret crush on Ian, and even invited him to her 7th grade dance.<br /><br />Ian, now engaged, and owner of a business Anne cannot condone or accept (an antique shop), forms a friendship with Anne, and the two start a Thursday night ritual of cocktails. After meeting his fianc&eacute; Helene, Anne finds herself jealous, and Rip realizes that his \\"polliwog\\" may have eyes for another. As Ian and Anne spend more and more time together, and he's supportive of her quest to develop a parcel of land for open space, she discovers that she does indeed have feelings for him, but is unsure if she can settle for a hand-me-down boyfriend, especially one that worked his way through the Olsen sisters.<br /><br />Nichol's latest is an engaging and very amusing story of one woman's quest to find herself and carve out her own path, as she compares herself to the many accomplishments of her older sisters. At time's Anne is a bit over the top (for instance, the whole chip thing). The poignant, humorous, and well-written story will resonate with anyone with an older sibling.	2005-08-22

But her trump card is the relationship she has with Phoebe Calebow, owner of the Stars, and nemesis of Heath. If he can get into Phoebe's good graces, one of his biggest obstacles can be overcome. When Annabelle and Heath give in to their growing feelings for each other while on a weekend retreat, Annabelle realizes that the rules have changed, and finding his perfect match will cause her heartbreak.<br /><br />Loaded with SEP's signature crisp and witty dialogue, \\"Match Me if You Can\\" is a charming entry into the Stars/Bonner Brothers series. A bonus is the funny secondary romance between Portia and Bodie, who fashions himself as Heath's \\"bodyguard.\\" He's a former football player and she's a former socialite.

He gives her an ultimatum - marry Alex Markov, or she will be cast of without any inheritance.<br /><br />She unwillingly marries Alex (and the marriage vows are funny when she cannot remember his name), and he immediately whisks her off to her new lifestyle. Instead of the life of a pampered princess, she instead is the wife of a circus performer, and expected to pitch in for the good of the show. Alex does his best to make her as uncomfortable as possible.<br /><br />Expecting Daisy to balk at the notion of working in a circus, instead she flourishes, excelling at caring for the animals in the menagerie. Initially, they despise each other and the circumstances that brought them together. Soon they warm up to each other, sparking jealousy in Alex's former lovers and a teen with a crush, both out to hurt Daisy. Alex has made it clear to Daisy that he will never love her, nor does he want children. Despite this, she is falling for her husband.<br /><br />Alex has secrets of his own, and though he too is falling in love with his wife, he cannot seem to trust her, and his lack of trust can threaten the relationship more than any outside influences.	2005-08-15

Maggie and Charlie create and answer personal ads for their friends, only to find that they can't seem to keep away from each other.<br /><br />From the moment that the two meet, Maggie and Charlie exude chemistry. Maggie is as uptight and anal retentive as Charlie is laid back, and they clash from the start. Neither is willing to throw in the towel and admit that Julie and Dom are not a match made in Heaven. Instead they scheme to keep them together, despite one disastrous date after another, mostly so that they can continue to interact.<br /><br />While it is clear from the start that Dom and Julie have next to nothing in common (and the recaps of the doomed dates are priceless), it is clear to everyone but Maggie and Charlie that they belong together. Getting them to admit it to each other is going to be the hard part, especially since she plans to marry perfect boyfriend Jason, and Charlie plans to remain a bachelor.<br /><br />Equal parts humor and passion make this a funny and winning combination.

Books	4	4	4	N	N	Didn't quite meet my expextations, but is an engaging love story	When Annie was 18 and Joe was 20, they planned to get married due to a surprise pregnancy. After losing their baby, Joe felt such guilt that he committed himself to the church and became a priest (known fondly by his parishioners as Father What-a-Hunk). Annie took his abandonment hard and became a bit loose, never giving her heart when she gave away her body.<br /><br />Joe, now 35, has never been able to commit himself fully to the church, as he still has feelings for Annie. His decision to leave the church was not taken lightly, though his mother and grandmother give him a hard time about it.<br /><br />Joe pursues Annie with vigor (particularly funny is when he sings \\"Annie's Song\\" to her at his best friends wedding, much to her mortification) and he tries to reconcile with her. But Annie has never forgiven him for deserting him when she needed him most. He takes a job that will put him in close proximity of her, and sparks fly. Of course, Joe's Mother, Sophia has plans for her now single son - to marry a nice Italian girl, and Annie does not fit into her plans.<br /><br />As they slowly get to know each other again, and Joe constantly professes his love to a very reticent Annie, both realize that they cannot relive the past if they are to carve out a future.<br /><br />The premise of this book had me so looking forward to it, but I was a little let down - I was expecting more tension between the leads, and more challenges to overcome besides their meddlesome parents. I also got a little tired of all the Yiddish and the overuse of the term \\"oy\\" - I found it annoying and somewhat stereotypical.<br /><br />Overall, they are likeable characters and it is a fun book to read, and provides readers with an update on Mary and Dan from \\"The Trouble With Mary.\\"	2005-08-10

The trouble with Mary is that her mother has no problem telling her what her trouble is.<br /><br />In an act of either defiance or maturity, she shucks her comfy existence, throws caution to the wind, moves out of her parents' home, and opens her own restaurant. Next on her agenda is to find a man that can make her \\"zing\\" (and relieve 32 years of pent up virginity).<br /><br />Things run smooth until Dan Gallagher, a sports columnist and self-proclaimed Italian food hater (filling in as food editor) gives her a scathing review. When she confronts him, he is immediately attracted to the Italian spitfire. Of course, in order to gain her attention, he is going to have to eat a lot of Italian food. After a first kiss with plenty of zing, Dan may just be a contender.<br /><br />Mary and his surly, foul-mouthed son Matt bond quickly, with the help of her quirky Italian obscenity-spewing kleptomaniac grandmother. Dan mistakenly blames the break down of his marriage on his wife for going back to work. Something that does not sit well with Mary, who has no intention of giving up her restaurant.<br /><br />With a backdrop of the funniest and most dysfunctional, meddlesome, but loving family, Mary and Dan embark on a romance, neither one really knowing what the other wants for the future. Except for each other.<br /><br />It is a charming intro to what inevitably will be an engaging series of books with Baltimore's Little Italy as a back-drop. I am looking forward to the further adventures of the Russo gang!	2005-08-09

When they both end up at the Calebow family cabin for a weekend alone, she acts on her crush by climbing into bed with him.

Kevin is forced by her brother in law (and GM of the Stars) to make an honest woman out of her. They begrudgingly go along with the scheme with plans for an annulment after the baby is born, unfortunately, tragedy strikes first. When Kevin discovers that she's been a shut in, he takes her with him to a campground he inherited from his deceased parents. It's not the stuffy old folks retreat he remembers from his childhood - it's now a B&B with cottages that cater to the family crowd, and it's there that Molly comes alive again, as she and Kevin's relationship takes a dramatic turn.<br /><br />This is the fifth book in the Chicago Stars/Bonner Brothers series of books, and definitely one of her more bittersweet and tear inducing. Interspersed with passages from Molly's series of Daphne the Bunny/Benny the Badger books, it's so charming when Kevin discovers that many of Benny's antics coincide with incidents from his own past.

Her sister-in-law Emily wants to turn the wedding into Tara West (complete with hoop skirts, confederate soldiers, and a dog named Rhett), much to Ashley and Kevin's chagrin.<br /><br />While planning the wedding of her dreams, Ashley also has to deal with the possibility of a move to another coast, an unwanted promotion, another misunderstanding which results in a stint in the slammer, a mystery surrounding her roommate Kay, a singles group that thinks she is a traitor, and the return of former paramour, Seth Greenwood, who takes a job at her firm. Also on hand to add to the tension is ever vigilant snobby mother in law, Elaine Novak. She can quiet a room with a single laser remark.<br /><br />Ashley still harbors insecurity about her and Kevin. You see, she thinks she is average while Kevin looks like Hugh Jackman. We know this because the author takes the time to mention it. Constantly. Over and over. It was bad enough in the first two books, but the constant barrage of Hugh-likenesses in this one grates on the nerves. At one point, she even writes \\"did I mention he looks like Hugh Jackman?\\" Yeah, about 30 times now and counting...<br /><br />Author Billerbeck does the impossible - she just keeps upping the ante and making her character more compelling with each novel. And Hugh Jackman references aside, we are treated to a rollicking trip down the marital aisle that only Ashley can muster - and we are left hoping for a fourth installment.<br /><br />Each book can stand on its own, but read them in order to get the full Ashley Experience.	2005-08-04

She decides to quit, return to South Carolina, and look up the guy that said he would wait for her forever. Marrying Bobby would be her backup plan and a way to escape her guilt over losing Peter.<br /><br />Depressed and spending the majority of her days watching soaps or sitting by the pool, Dinah is unsuccessful at hooking up with Bobby, who never seems to be in town (and is now engaged). She does not count on falling for his roguish bad-boy brother, Cordell. Cord has been in love with Dinah since they were kids; he even made up a little white lie to keep Dinah and Bobby apart, only to have it backfire on him. Dinah just thinks he is a trouble maker. While Cord claims to not be the marrying kind, he certainly does not want Dinah and Bobby to reconcile, so he schemes to keep Bobby on assignment in Atlanta.<br /><br />The more time Cord and Dinah spend together, the harder they fall for each other, until he finally realizes that the only way to show his love for Dinah is to let her resolve the conflict that brought her home and has caused so much post traumatic stress. Dinah makes progress on her own with the help of a caring psychologist.<br /><br />The Backup Plan is an entertaining romantic comedy with a hint of despair - parts of the book might make you cry, particularly her flashbacks to Afghanistan. The only thing standing in the way of a 5 star rating is the lack of depth into the character of Bobby. He was never developed, and really on appears on a handful of pages.

After a blow up, she finally gets her comeuppance when Ethan tells it like it is to her, and she finds herself attracted to him, but could it be too late, since both of them are dating others?<br /><br />Author Giffin manages to make a thoroughly infuriating and self centered character capture your attention and then your heart, making you  believe that even someone as nasty as Darcy deserves a happily ever after. \\"Something Blue\\" does what few sequels are able to do - continue the quality storytelling while also being able to stand on its own merits.	2005-08-01

Instead of taking it for what it is - a bunch of shagging - she thinks that John is her destiny, and starts to fall in love with him, not giving a second thought to her devoted husband Luke, who has been putting in too much time in his thriving restoration business.<br /><br />When she discovers that she is not the only one in John's life, she is devastated. I guess his comment that she is his 100th lover and the fact that they only get together once a week has slipped by her... Anyhow, after this devastating news, and the fact that he is suddenly distant, they end the affair and life goes on. News that her best friend's husband has run off with another woman cuts deep - especially to Luke who cannot forgive his friend for the infidelity.<br /><br />John suddenly wants Connie back and Luke finds out about the deception. Once Luke is gone, she realizes that she was her destiny all along, and will have to leap through hoops to regain his love and trust again.<br /><br />It is hard to like Connie. Despite seemingly having it all, she is so full of herself, which makes if difficult to feel she deserves a second chance. I would also have liked to see the characters of John and Luke more fleshed out. Particularly Luke, as he garners more than a casual mention throughout the book - no real time is spent to define his character. It is not the definitive book on the subject, but a quick and interesting character study nonetheless.	2005-07-27

In order for the couple to obtain their prizes, they must pass the truth and the dare of the competition.<br /><br />When she meets Justin Mann (her date), she is not all that impressed with how arrogant he is (especially since he is disappointed that she cut her long hair). He is big on style and labels, and only gets excited when there is a mention of prizes. His real purpose for being on the show is to launch his stagnant acting career. When Park gets a look at the sexy man behind the camera, Grant Hastings, all possibility for romance with Justin is off. Since they have signed no fraternization clauses, Grant and Park tried their darndest not to get too close.<br /><br />But there is trouble brewing in the background, as someone wants to shut down production to get even with Natasha the producer, who is trying her hardest to get another season out of the network, and has to keep reminding Grant to curtail his feelings for their leading lady.<br /><br />I was kinda hoping for more extreme dares, though the \\"mint kiss\\" was absolutely hysterical. It was a funny book - and I could certainly see this premise played out on reality TV - it hooks the reader until the very end.	2005-07-25

Soon she discovers that residing in the penthouse in her building is a more extroverted Nancy Stern - a celebrity journalist with a pretty wild social life.<br /><br />In addition to misrouted mail, she gets a lot of phone calls also. She probably would not have accepted a blind date with a caller had the other Nancy not been so nasty. But once Nancy lays her eyes on successful jeweler, Bill Harris. Once the lies start though, she cannot stop the floodgates, and is compelled to continue the charade. Because Bill puts such a high stake in honesty, Nancy decides that the relationship will have to end, so she breaks up with him, thinking she will never have to tell him the truth. Until the other Nancy is brutally murdered, and Bill learns the truth.<br /><br />With Bill's help, she is out to discover if Nancy's death is related to the break ins and muggings that she has been victim to - could the killer have been after her all along. And does it have anything to do with the tacky brooch that one of her students gave her as a gift?<br /><br />This is a great and humorous take on mistaken identity.

I had a hard time with this one - and it all boils down to the use of first person - a first for Howard. I could not decide if this was a romantic mystery or a variation on humorous chick lit. And lets face it, the steamy romance was pretty non-existent. The strengths of the story is the relationships - particularly the dynamics of Blair's family.<br /><br />Blair is a divorced gym owner. She cleaned out in her divorce because her unfaithful husband made a pass at her teenage sister, and she managed to get the goods on film. A murder outside her gym brings police lieutenant, Wyatt Bloodsworth on the scene. Wyatt and Blair dated briefly years earlier, but he just stopped calling with no explanation (and it takes until the end to find out why).<br /><br />She immediately cops attitude with him, as he investigates the crime, and starts to fall for her. In turn she becomes his biggest nightmare when she finds out that he has told people they are dating. And so the \\"list of transgressions\\" starts, as we are taken on a hilarious journey as the two protagonists fight each other as well as their mutual attraction.<br /><br />When another attempt is made on her life, Wyatt moves her into his apartment and has his mom baby-sit her. She still manages to get into trouble, and a whole other list of transgressions is drafted. I found myself laughing so much at her antagonistic behavior with regard to Wyatt, and like all his co-workers, felt sorry for him.	2005-07-19

Mirri, who has a penchant for rescuing big game animals, is still able to entice men half her age into her bed. Under Mirri's tutelage, Kate makes some dramatic changes in her appearance, tries not to let Jake take advantage of her, and works on finding her inner-goddess.

Needless to say, the nuptials did not go on as planned, and Amy moved on to a great job as a book publicist. A chance run-in with Tara nearly five years later brings back old memories, and in order to make herself feel better, she tells a little white lie - she is engaged.  Amy has always lived in Tara's shadow, and has always felt inferior to her.<br /><br />Suddenly, Amy is thrust into a situation where she has to publicize Tara's soon to be published book about her fabulous life with her husband, Stuart.

When she discovers that a new reality show (Fat 2 Fabulous) for women size 16 and over is scouting for participants, she eagerly signs up. This is just the medicine for her inability to get herself into shape and to meet the internet love of her life (who she coincidentally has never actually met, and the only picture he has of her is a grainy shot she doctored with Photoshop). Because after all, losing weight will make everything in her life fall into place, right?<br /><br />She and her on-line lothario Nick (who resides in London), exchange daily emails and occasional phone calls, laced with phone sex. He professes his love for her, and constantly wants her to visit him in London. He is under the mistaken impression that Kat is a size 4; it is obvious from their first conversation just how shallow Nick is.<br /><br />Once she is accepted, she hooks up with her new roomies, they discover that the show is not just about losing weight. There is the hunky exercise guru who works the camera more than the contestants; the horribly healthy meals that they are served (of course, counter-acted with the tomb of temptation - a pantry full of everything you could ever want to gorge out on); and the contestants themselves, who for the most part squabble and fight with the evil Alicia who is so full of herself that it is surprising that she would want to be associated with a show with the word \\"fat\\" in it.<br /><br />The show is full of lots of surprises - in addition to the dieting they have to participate in games in order to secure money and prizes (ultimately, the person with the largest bank wins in the end). They get money for exercising as well as losing weight and winning games. Like \\"Survivor,\\" they even get a chance to have someone special come visit them. You can probably guess whom Kat's \\"someone special\\" is.<br /><br />While Kat obsesses over the way that the public has perceived her, she finds a tender ear in the show's host, Jagger, who has obviously taken a liking to the sarcastic southerner.<br /><br />At times, it is hard to like the character of Kat; she can be caustic and whiny, but by the end, she manages to provide a lot of insight on what it is to live in an oversized body. In addition to losing weight, she manages to learn a lot about herself. There are a lot of characters, but each is so well-defined that the story does not get muddled. There are also a lot of laugh-out-loud moments when six cranky women are stuck in a house with no padlock on the junk food vault.

His wife complies and the prodigal son is summoned.  Of course not on is Rink her stepson, he is also her first (and only) love. Of course Roscoe's motivations for a reunion are not all out of compassion for the son he lost; it is just one more chance to one up him by flaunting his relationship with wife Caroline in Rink's face. Roscoe was the main antagonist who drove the two apart when they were engaging in an elicit relationship (Caroline was 15; Rink was 22 - kinda icky).<br /><br />Rink cannot help himself and his still intense feelings for Caroline. A stolen kiss here; a grope there. But underlying in his thoughts is that his father made love to her first. Can Rink ever get over his pride and declare his love for Caroline?<br /><br />\\"Bittersweet Rain\\" is a melodramatic love story set against the machinations of a truly evil and desperate man, who loves no one, least of all himself. His contempt for the less than perfect daughter (who loves him unconditionally) makes you want to punch him. There is a lot of chemistry between the two leads; but clunky, dated love scenes (his \\"maleness\\"; her \\"feminine core\\"). One of the most endearing qualities of the book is the emerging relationship between Rink's sister Laura Jane, and the disabled ranch hand, Steve.<br /><br />Though a little dated (it was originally written in 1984; re-released in 2000), it was an enjoyable and romantic romp.	2005-07-15

Cocktails with friends results in a brilliant idea for a show - \\"Sex With an Ex,\\" whereby about to be married couples have their relationship tested by temptation with a former lover. Her concept works a little too good, as ratings go through the roof. She meets a possible \\"ex\\" named Darren. He's intelligent, sexy, and very engaging, and she is very attracted, knowing that the entire English population will fall for him (thus a ratings bonanza). He declines the show citing that it's a blight on relationships and wants no part of it. To change his mind and chip away at his strong morals, she hangs out with him and his family for a few days, fighting her attraction to him. She'll leave no stone unturned in order to change his mind, and tells him so, but he stands his ground. No doubt about it - Darren is a dream come true; he's not afraid to show his feelings or stand up for what he believes in, including the happily ever after that Cas is so strongly opposed to. Suddenly, ice-hearted Cas is finding herself in unchartered territory - she's falling in love with Darren. Her reaction to their mutual feelings is what takes the rest of the story on a roller coaster ride, as she immediately reverts to her old, selfish ways, and is confronted with her past misdeeds in the most publically humiliating way.<br /><br />\\"Game Over\\" is a interesting romantic comedy that also speaks volumes about back stabbers in the workplace and faith in the one you love. Although it's hard to find any redeeming qualities in Cas (\\"bag em; shag em; and send em packing\\"), if you stick with it, you'll be rewarded with a very fascinating story, as like the \\"Grinch,\\" Cas' heart grows two sizes by the end. It's amazing that someone like him would even bother with a gal like her. She's constantly nasty to him - any other guy would just leave, not wanting to be just another notch on her bedpost.

As preparations begin to rehearse a play by an Irish playwright, Declan Pearse, Rosalie enters into an affair with her friends father, Berglan Starker. He wines and dines her in all the finest restaurants and hotels. I can certainly appreciate a nice May-December romance, but there is absolutely no chemistry between the two. It is more of a father-daughter relationship, particularly in the way they communicate. Of course, Rosalie is falling for her old man. He senses this, and ends the relationship. Declan deduces that Berglan is her paramour. On a trip back from Boston, he & Rosalie get to know each other better. When his fiance comes to NY for a visit, Rosalie wants to dislike her, but cannot seem to.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this book. I liked the premise of the story, but I thought that the actual characters lacked depth; I got no real sense for their motivations, and the only one that was remotely interesting was Declan. I had a really hard time sticking with it. I found the advice letters that preceded each chapter to be annoying, and finally started to skip them altogether. Even the ending was less than satisfying.

With the help of her psychic mother, she plans a live on-air seance to bring the dead teens back to solve the crime on national television. The problem is her psychic mom is blocked. But the show must go on, despite protestations of the town mayor and harried new police chief, Joe Franconi. Joe has his own set of issues, including discussions with a long-dead friend, Brian. Soon, another murder with the same MO occurs, and it looks like Nicky is another of the intended victims.<br /><br />From the moment they meet, Joe is attracted to Nicky. She, on the other hand is quite surly since no one gets in her way of the story, even to the detriment of an on-going police investigation. Joe does his best to protect her, but she won't have it - she has to be at the crux of the action. He'd have been better off letting the killer take care of her. I never really felt like the connection was there on her end - she seemed to be using him to further her career, so the romance was lukewarm. Joe has a checkered past, which threatens his new position in the wrong hands (i.e., an ambitious reporter).<br /><br />The story meanders for quite some time, then tosses in lots of last minute plot twists, and an implausible turn of events that makes you go \\"huh?\\" to end the story abruptly. The most interesting characters were Joe and Cleo the pork-eating pig (the scene where they are caught on camera is hysterical). The writing is clunky, the plot boring and drawn out, and the psychic aspects just overused. I wasn't too impressed - I expect a bit more from a Karen Robards thriller.	2005-07-07

A member of the rag tag hockey champs - the New York Blades - he has recently taken over his family's restaurant. He hires her to do PR for the restaurant since she won't give him the time of day since he is from the old neighborhood - and a hockey player.<br /><br />Theresa is the partner of Janna, who captured the heart of the team captain, Ty from \\"Body Check.\\" It is nice to get an update on life in the Gallagher household, but much of the story is bogged down with her constant rejections of Michael, and his doormat tendency to chase after her, while trying to hold on to his position on the team.<br /><br />I had a hard time understanding his attraction. She was actually quite mean to him, and had an enormous chip on her shoulder for both her neighborhood, and her heritage. I thought he deserved better. And as a reader, I deserved a better follow up.	2005-07-06

Hired to spruce up the image of the NY Blades (a hockey team full of bad boys), she manages to make an enemy out of team captain Ty Gallagher. Ty is press shy, would rather just concentrate on hockey and win another Stanley Cup. So he fights her all the way, resulting in a real antagonistic relationship.<br /><br />There is a thin line between lust and hate, and they manage to cross it and the puck and ice start flying as he is nervous about tempting the superstitious fates and juggling his love for hockey and the new woman in his life. Which one he chooses is the big question.<br /><br />\\"Body Check\\" is full of funny lines that will have you laughing out loud, and has some really great secondary characters (Theresa and Michael get their own story in the follow up, \\"Fair Play\\"). But it still pales in comparison to Rachel Gibson's \\"See Jane Score.\\"	2005-07-06

With the aid of her former brother-in-law, Nell takes a job at the crumbling McKenna detective agency and immediately sets about to \\"clean things up.\\" Reticent owner Gabe is not really happy about the sudden whirlwind of organization that has befallen his agency, but soon just says \\"uncle.\\" Some really witty bantering, sleuthing, murders, affairs, sex in the office, dognapping, and eventually love transpire to keep these two together as Nell sets about resolving some old and seemingly unsolvable crimes.<br /><br />Jennifer Crusie is always a must read for me. Gabe and Nell make a dynamic duo, and it was nice to have a heroine that no longer has her baby teeth taking center stage, even if the story was a little predictable. Overall, it is a 3.5 star novel.	2005-07-06

She has nightmares stemming back to an incident when she was six. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to guess what that incident involved. Now grown up, she is only interested in making money, with a cash register for a heart.<br /><br />This is yet another bad boy returns to his hometown to rescue the over-30 virginal damsel in distress who saved herself for him, only to not realize it at the time. And the dialog is so grating. Her refers to her constantly as \\"darling mine\\" and \\"dear heart\\"... what is this, 1876? No contemporary guy under 60 would talk like that.<br /><br />The plot, while interesting, is not well drawn out. There is really nothing likable about Cyd to attract the lust of Ewan. She is rude and just annoying - not sure what he sees in her, particularly since she constantly refers to him as an idiot. I found all their interactions to be annoying - her constant harping on him selling his land was so redundant. I was kind of hoping someone would the darned bogey man get her and put us out of our misery. The ending was clich&eacute;d and abrupt, trying to hard too wrap things up.<br /><br />The more interesting romance (by far) involved Ewan's sister and his best friend, Sean. Unfortunately, no real storyline was devoted to the much more appealing pair.	2005-07-06

When she tells him about her husband being murdered, and that all evidence points to her, he vows to help her, while trying to keep his heart from getting stomped all over again.<br /><br />His family is furious that he has renewed his friendship with Mary Elizabeth. He removes himself from the case, and then assigns his trusted deputy and brother in law, Walker Ames to investigate the case. Walker, a former DC detective relishes the opportunity, if only Tucker would truly bud out of the investigation.<br /><br />This is a cute story about two people reluctant about taking a second chance, despite the manipulations of outside forces to keep them apart. When they finally give in, you know that they were meant to be together all along.<br /><br />This is the final Trinity Harbor book following \\"About that Man\\" and \\"Ask Anyone\\" - oops - I read them out of order!	2005-07-05

Bea has always had a crush on Phillip, and decides that now's the time to pounce on him, and she seduces him in his office. Phillip is not sure of his feelings toward Bea; he's afraid that his colleagues will think he was the Boy Toy of the Evangeline then crudely bedded down the daughter. Of course he throws caution to the wind and they enter into a steamy affair.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bea's gorgeous friend, Lela is given the opportunity to help save the New York branch of Meilleurs Amis. Her ex-lover sets her up with a chance meeting with his boss, business magnate, Simon Graves. The two share a steamy adventure in the store's dressing room, and soon she's asking him for lessons in how to manage a company, in exchange for sex. Simon doesn't count on his heart getting involved, and his relationship with Lela threatens his takeover plans for Meilleurs Amis. Will Phillip throw caution to the wind, follow his heart, and stick it out with Bea? Will Lela learn about Simon's deception?<br /><br />This novel is so full of steam that you will need to make sure you have the A/C on while reading! But unlike so many other highly sexual books, this one has a pretty intriguing plot line, as well as some emotion on the part of the characters. The chemistry between the two couples is intense, and I found myself glued to it for the whole takeover plot. Be warned, it's very frank and graphic and just about every possible coupling (or triple) finds its way to the pages.	2005-07-05

Her perfect cousin, Jessie also lost her parents and moved in with grams and got all the attention. Ro has a massive crush on fellow cousin Webb (his grandma and Ro and Jessie's grandma are sisters), who has always stood up for her. Of course, when they grow up, it is Jessie that Webb woos and marries, much to Ro's heartbreak.<br /><br />But a kiss suddenly turns passionate and results in turmoil for all members of the family. After Jessie discovers Webb and Ro in each others arms, she throws a fit (despite being in a torrid affair with her birth father). They fight and Webb walks out and soon Jessie is found bludgeoned, and all the family except Ro think Webb is guilty. After being cleared, Webb moves to Arizona and becomes a hardened and weary man.  He returns years later at Lucinda's request. She sends Ro for him, and he agrees as long as she provides what everyone assumes he got when she was a teen. He is shocked when she agrees to sleep with him.<br /><br />When he returns to the family home, they continue the relationship, not realizing that the other actually means to them. Meanwhile, Webb is searching for the actual murderer of Jessie, while family members still taunt him and confront him with their suspicions.<br /><br />One has to ask - why hasn't Lucinda tossed out the freeloaders? this one is dated, which is why the heroine lacks a real backbone. But overall, it is a passionate love story/mystery. You willbe surprised when the killer is revealed.	2005-07-05

Mountain man Jamie has been living as a recluse in the hills above Visitation, North Carolina. He is soon visited by someone from his past who worked in the clinic specializing in paranormal experimentation where he spent several years. Jamie is not only clairvoyant, but he can also read thoughts and make predictions. Which kind of annoys his few friends when he answers questions before being asked.<br /><br />Faith was a record keeper at the clinic. Now years later, she tries to keep the bad guys from him while asking for his help in keeping her daughter safe. Of course, soon they fall for each other, while danger lurks in the shadows, bringing back memories from his time in captivity.<br /><br />The final installment in a five-book series starting with \\"Say No to Joe,\\" you probably need to read the others to truly enjoy this one. I am not a fan of the sequel books (or movies). I found the presence of the characters from the rest of the series popping in and out to be kind of annoying.<br /><br />Overall, I found the story to be predictable, monotonous, and not quite up to what I expect from a Lori Foster book, which is mainly her trademark for sizzling romance. This one was lukewarm at best and I just could not get into the whole paranormal aspect to the story.<br /><br />If you want to give Jamie a chance, be sure to read Joe, Bryan, Bruce, and Clint first, or you might be as disappointed as I was.	2005-07-05

After his parents' death, young Beau kept the family together by being a guardian to his sisters.  So it is time for him to step out and get a social life of his own.<br /><br />Sparks fly between the two though I am not sure how she knew what he was talking about with the thick New Orleans dialect built into the dialog. Soon, Beau is questioning whether there is room in his life for this new lady or if he wants to continue to play the field. I like her response to that.<br /><br />Totally predictable; you will know who the person writing the letters is almost from the star.	2005-07-05

Turns out he's Derek Knight, an undercover FBI agent and his color blind informant put the evidence for his big case in the wrong rental car. As soon as she discovers the contents of the package that Derek wants, she strikes a bargain with him to get the scoop. He pretends to bite, and she continually gets in the way of the investigation, to the point that it's surprising he doesn't just shoot her. But within moments of making contact, they are in bed, and of course this leads to love. Pretty much the majority of the book is one sexual encounter after another with a couple scenes with the bad guys sprinkled in. I was wondering when the porn music would cue up.<br /><br />Witty dialog and sizzling romance abound in \\"Smart Mouth,\\" but there's not a lot of character development to sustain the story, a common problem with books authored by prolific McCarthy (definitely a passion over plot writer). Despite its lack of direction, I still managed to enjoy it.	2005-07-05

And that does not bode well for Jack Reilly, who fled the town for college and a stint on the LAPD. Now retired, he is back to fill in as sheriff temporarily when he gets a call about an abandoned baby.<br /><br />Carol Baker finds a baby in the town's manger and gets to be foster mom until other arrangements can be made. Being an orphan herself, she does not want the baby to have to go to a \\"home.\\" Jack helps her get settled, and then notes that she notes a vacant apartment for rent. Wanting to get out of his family's home, he takes the apartment, and soon they are in a romance, while the birthmother continues to see the baby and Carol wonders if she will attempt to regain custody.<br /><br />Jack's hatred of the holiday season is constantly hinted at, as well as his need to be away from Christmas. As he gets further involved with Carol, he questions his motivations.<br /><br />For the romance aspect and the relationship of the two lead characters, the story is well developed. Any reader of suspense novels will be able to guess the identity of the birth mother within the first chapters, so there are no surprises in this predictable romance.	2005-07-05

There was really no story, nothing like \\"Personal Assets.\\" It was so disappointing - just one encounter to the next. I found it laughable that any woman (including someone like Charity) would have such low self esteem that she would choose either one of these guys (let alone both).  Save your money and read Personal Assets instead.	2005-07-05

Liv is reluctant to enter into any more romantic entanglements despite the efforts of her friends and family. She never really meets anyone she likes until she runs into Drew. They go out a couple times, and through a series of misunderstandings, have difficulty trusting one another, and she won't give Drew the same second chance he afforded her when she misconstrues his intentions toward a former flame. She is visited by the ghost of a former colleague who warns that she will be visited by 3 Valentines ghosts (sound familiar?). Each ghost provides insight - into her relationships past, present, and potentially future.<br /><br />You know there'll be a happy ending, but getting there should be half the fun. For the most part it is, however, after all the build up and narrative, I was expecting a little more out of those last 40 pages. The ending seemed so rushed, and the last visit with the ghost did not pack the wallop I was hoping for. It could have been so much better with a tad more development and attention to detail in the end.	2005-06-29

After fleeing for sedate Vermont for the last five years, she returns to her Atlantic City roots and quirky Greek family of con artists, as she searches for her missing (and presumed dead) twin sister, Zoe.<br /><br />Within hours, she is tackled by Quinn Donovan on the beach when someone takes a shot at her, assuming she is Zoe. Quinn recommends that she go back to Vermont. She is not sure what to think of him, but throws caution to the wind, and gets a job at the casino Zoe worked at to investigate her disappearance and get closer to Quinn, though she does not know that he is a cop deep undercover, and her nosiness could destroy two years of work. As he tries to watch over her, they become involved even deeper, threatening his cover. They think that they are too different - she has a loud, Greek family that she is ashamed of, while he spent most of his youth in foster care.<br /><br />There is so much packed in to make it funny, like a pocket-picking monkey with a penchant to strip, a lonely runaway in need of a good family, and a odd-ball assortment of relatives that would rather con their way into riches (or don \\"Addams Family\\" garb and perform) than get 9 to 5 jobs.<br /><br />While not exactly worthy of a Pulitzer, it will provide plenty of chuckles and is pure escapism.	2005-06-28

Except this guru is nothing more than a figurehead - in reality, she does not know how to cook and those great crafts are produced by her staff.<br /><br />After her #1 fan is killed in a car accident, Claire discovers that she has \\"inherited\\" the woman's child. She knows less about children than she does about crafts, but she takes the kid in until the long-absent can be found.<br /><br />Enter Ramsey Sage, 100% pure all-American beefcake. From the barb wire tattoo, tight jeans, Harley, and ripped t-shirts, he is not what Claire expected as the prospective guardian to this child. She is completely attracted to him, but decides to keep custody until Ramsey can prove that he is not a deadbeat. Ramsey tells her that he will do anything to get baby Annabel, even if it means getting closer to uptight Claire. But will he go as far as to divulge her secret? Turns out Ramsey has plenty of secrets of his own.<br /><br />The story is cute, and has a little too much narrative. Although, the narrative and introspection can be downright hilarious at times, it can also be tedious and bog down the story.  But it captured my attention and I loved the way that the characters in the end got exactly what they deserved. It is a really funny and quick read.	2005-06-27

Harriet and Joe now have five children that Cassie has never met. Now a successful advertising executive, with a fiance of her own, she returns home in time to say goodbye to her dying father, who in a last ditch effort to patch things up between the two sisters, has willed his home and all its possessions to Cassie in hopes that she'll return for good.<br /><br />Cassie is reticent to see her sister, and still has ambivalent feelings for Joe. But what she doesn't count on is her feelings for old pal, Sam, who once was the class geek, and is now the respected town doctor. Sam has always had a crush on Cassie, but never revealed his true feelings (and when he does, he packs an emotional wallop). She is hoping to sell the house quickly and return to her fiance and her life in Manhattan; Sam has other ideas, as he tries to create a preservationist group to keep developers from turning her home into commercial property.<br /><br />This story is so well written, and packed with so much humor and emotion, that it easily garners 5 stars. White manages to make you feel for the characters, and really relate to them (though Andrew was a bit one dimensional). And just when you think you know what is going to happen, a twist comes in to throw you off (though the supposed mystery really is not a mystery - you see that coming a mile away). I finished the book in a single day - I just couldn't put it down. It is very rare that a novel can elicit tears from a reader. \\"Falling Home\\" does that and more. It'll make you laugh, and it'll make you cry, but most of all, it will make you want to reconcile with your siblings. The Walton saga continues with \\"After the Rain.\\"	2005-06-27

Enough of the born again virgin plot lines - it is so overused.<br /><br />The secondary romance with the uncle and her mother is also very sweet. I like that she showed a lot of emotion in how she dealt with the fact that her widowed mother was willing and able to take a chance at romance again. It is a good light suspense romantic novel.	2005-06-27

Her disturbingly geeky rendition of an erotic dance has him scratching his head, but does not preclude the two from hooking up.<br /><br />The only problem with Jane's logic is that despite his chosen profession, Cal is no dumb jock. When he discovers that he is about to become a daddy, he insists that they marry to make the baby legitimate, and Jane begrudgingly joins him at his home in North Carolina to wait out the baby's arrival so they can part ways. The two are like oil and water, and the shenanigans they engage in to one up each other are hysterical, particularly her role as a \\"cereal killer\\" to his beloved Lucky Charms.

Luckily, each stands on its own merits.<br /><br />Bobby Tom Denton is a former wide-receiver for the Chicago Stars. Due to a career ending injury, he is about to make his movie debut, provided it is filmed in his hometown to drum up business due to the town's primary employer relocating. Of course, getting him to the set is going to be half the fun. The production company hires virginal Gracie Snow, a no-nonsense former elder care administrator to bring him on location. Gracie is a mousy little thing - we know this because we are hit over the head with how plain she is and how gorgeous he is throughout the story. Most of Gracie's charges give her a hard time, but none as bad as Bobby.<br /><br />One of the funniest scenes is when he is on a \\"date\\" with Gracie tagging along. The interaction between the three of them, cramped in his tiny Thunderbird while he is sweet talking his \\"date\\" (but paying far too much attention to Gracie) is hysterical.<br /><br />The whole trip down he tries to dump her, but she keeps outsmarting him. When they finally arrive on location, several days late, Gracie is fired. Out of guilt, Bobby makes them hire her back, and agrees to secretly pay her salary. After a makeover, he asks her to pretend to be his fiance to fend off unwanted females. She agrees under the stipulation that she pays her own way - she does not want to be just another sponge that hits him up for cash. Soon, Bobby does the charitable thing by initiating Gracie in \\"erotic arts\\" - what a philanthropist!<br /><br />One thing that annoyed me throughout this story was the goofy language - instead of saying bull, Gracie says balderdash. Now who since the 19th century says that? Yeah, she has spent a lot of time with old people, but please. I prefer contemporary stories to have believable dialogue.<br /><br />The story is a bit far-fetched - but a cute and very quick read.

Otherwise, it automatically goes to her cousin Reed, who has always given her the creeps (and later in the book, anyone can understand why).<br /><br />The problem is that Phoebe is a bit of a bimbo and knows nothing about football, contract negotiations, or salary disputes. And no one really wants to help her understand. She knows the inheritance is dad's way of having the last word, since he did not think she is cut out for it. Coach Dan Calebow just wants a new owner, until of course, he finds himself attracted to her. And he resents it when she wants to give the guys a pep talk, or come up with her own game-day rituals.<br /><br />Dan is a little down on women. His ex-wife is a senator with a sordid infatuation with sex games that she constantly drags him into. He is looking for a nice gal to settle down with, and pursues a grade school teacher with lots of fervor, but his real passion appears to be Phoebe. They fight the attraction but constantly end up in each others beds.<br /><br />It is also the story of the coming together of two estranged sisters. Molly has always been shuttled off to boarding school, which was Phoebe's initial plan since she appears to be such a trouble maker. But the two will need to learn to love and trust each other to take their relationship to the next level.<br /><br />While many readers criticized Phoebe for being a bimbo - I thought it was a good move. Finally - a sexually aggressive woman who knows what she has and goes after what she wants. It is about time that a romance novel did not have a 35-year old virgin as the lead just waiting for that one perfect hero (or worse, has not had an intimate relationship in a decade since her one and only and let's face it, bad experience!)<br /><br />The series includes (in order of publication): It Had to be You; Heaven, Texas; Nobody's Baby But Mine; Dream a Little Dream; This Heart of Mine.decade since her one and only and let's face it, bad experience!)  <br /> <br />The series includes (in order of publication): It Had to be You; Heaven, Texas; Nobody's Baby But Mine; Dream a Little Dream; This Heart of Mine.	2005-06-21

When the purchase of a new flat falls through, sister Kerry and Brendan show up on her doorstep asking for a place to stay for a week.

Amanda is living with her brother, drug dealer Val, in a seedy part of LA, while Val is slowly going over the edge. A chance meeting with his best friend, Gabe, turns into a passionate affair. James, who has never been faithful to Amanda, suspects something is up and returns to LA to collect his woman. He's upset to discover that she's taken up with a bi-racial man, and Amanda's forced to choose between the two. When an altercation with Val turns tragic, she is bound to a loveless marriage to James, all the while wondering what if her real love rescued her.<br /><br />The writing is stilted at some points - Grazer attempts to paint a portrait using a lot of narrative, and just goes overboard to the point where this reader was bored. It's a pretty short novel. There are about six pages between the tragedy and the big finish - nothing in between 1985 and 1995. I really think the story could have been better developed and perhaps expanded to provide detail of those missing years. Hard to believe that this was written by a Hollywood screenwriter. It just reeks of nepotism.	2005-06-20

She suspects that like her father years earlier, Chris has gotten away with murder.<br /><br />Her family owns a foundry, and has a history of OSHA violations and lack of respect for safety in general. Maiming, death and other industrial accidents on the job are just the cost of doing business for her father, Huff Hoyle. Because she has a long-standing hatred for her father, she takes the side of laborers, and plans to help them organize into a union, with some tragic results to a man from her past.<br /><br />Her father's right hand, lawyer Beck Merchant is sent to deal with her. Soon the two find a strange attraction to each other that neither wants to admit or act on. But is Beck who she really thinks he is?<br /><br />The story is fraught with nail biting suspense, and keeps you guessing until the end.	2005-06-20

Wracked with survivor guilt, she reluctantly bar hops with her single friends who try to teach her the ins and outs of dating. The only problem is that Gert hasn't been on a date in almost ten years. She's also struggling with the disintegration of her relationship with Marc's family - when he died, her role in their family ceased to exist.<br /><br />On her first outing, she meets Todd and they hit it off, much to the dismay of her friends. Apparently their rules state you cannot date the first guy you meet. Soon her friend Hallie is asking to be set up with his friend. Gert's relationship with Todd is sweet - the polar opposite of Marc. As they get closer, she realizes that she must eventually tell him about Marc. When she finally does, he appears understanding, and then slowly seems to drift away (but perhaps it is all in her mind).<br /><br />Meanwhile, Erika is stalking former boyfriend Ben and his wife. She dumped Ben in college, and after three months, decided he was her soul mate. Of course, he found another soul mate, married her, and now has a second baby on the way. Ben's wife is so happy that she has created a webpage that Erika becomes obsessed with, which eventually takes it's toll on Erika's sanity.<br /><br />The story is heart wrenching, particularly Gert's moments of reflective solitude, her participation in grief counseling comprised primarily of young widows from the 9/11 tragedy (Marc died a few days prior), and the feeling that while her friends mean well, they really don't have a clue what she's going through. Notht ekind of friends a widow would want to surround herself with. Another book with a similar theme is \\"Good Grief\\" by Lolly Winston.	2005-06-20

The list contains everything from niceness, to sexual prowess, so the authors are pretty embarrassed.<br /><br />Jaine is having problems with her neighbor - he has odd hours, drives a noisy car, and is pretty scruffy - he must be a drug dealer. After an altercation where she loses her temper, she discovers that Sam is in fact a police detective.  But soon, she is finding herself intrigued by Sam, particularly his lack of window coverings (and choice of sleepwear), and soon, they are succumbing to their mutual attraction, just as a crazed killer is hunting down the women behind \\"the list.\\"<br /><br />While the suspense is not that riveting, the entire premise is pretty clever, and the charismatic leads (and let's face it, vintage Linda Howard steam), as well as the witty dialogue keep you glued from page one.	2005-06-17

She begrudgingly agrees to be \\"Sandra\\" for a couple weeks to attract the attention of a press-shy playboy billionaire Jack Berenger so that her friend Carter can write a biography of him and become famous himself.<br /><br />Jack meets both Sandra and Molly. While Sandra, with her flowing blonde hair (wig), blue eyes (contacts), and curvy body (padding) are nice, he is more fascinated by Molly's lack of beauty regimen and complete rapture in telling pirate stories. He knows there's more under the packaging. Soon she's digging up the past to find that a female pirate once occupied the island the resort is on - and her plantation's right dab in the middle of Jack's proposed golf course. Klutzy Molly manages to fool Jack for a little while, but soon the jig is up. She's ready to leave his island until he propositions her to pose as his fiance to fend off bad publicity and a hostile takeover. She's a sedate alternative from the actresses he usually is linked with. Circumstances make her feel she has no choice but to take him up on his offer, provided he gives Carter an interview.<br /><br />There is a lot of chemistry with Jack and Molly. And Carter's marriage-challenged matchmaker half sister is a hoot. But throughout the story, I found it hard to believe that someone as nice as Molly would put up with a friend as selfish as Carter. I would have slugged him after being tripped with a boat oar! The story is like a Susan Elizabeth Phillips novel without the requisite sizzle factor, which does not detract from the story (just makes us have to use our imagination more).	2005-06-17

Caught in a moment of passion with Nick by her stepfather Henry, she flees town, returning 10 years later (amid numerous false rumors about her reasons for leaving) for henry's funeral and to learn the odd conditions of her inheritance.<br /><br />Their first meeting after ten years is at Henry's funeral - he shows up in jeans on his Harley, and picks up on one of the attendees. But he has no intentions of marriage, family, or giving Henry the heir he so desperately wanted.<br /><br />In order for her to inherit $3 million, she must remain in Truly, Idaho, the town that brought her so much pain. In order for Nick to inherit the land that his father has willed to him, he must never engage in a sexual relationship with Delaney. Henry is basically having the last word.<br /><br />Delaney has always thought Nick hated her because she lived in the big house, and he was all but forgotten by Henry. In reality, Nick has always felt a fondness for Delaney, as evidenced from the lengths he would go to grab her attention, oftentimes with mixed results.<br /><br />Despite constantly finding themselves thrown together, and some pretty steamy encounters, will they ever give in to their obvious attraction to each other? It is a Rachel Gibson book... of course they will. And because it is a Rachel Gibson book, there is lots of steam!<br /><br />It is a great, quick read (though like many other readers, I would have liked maybe one more chapter).

A one night stand whereby John dumps her at the airport with an airline ticket produces a precocious daughter named Lexie.<br /><br />Georgie has tried to move on with her life, she has a successful career as a caterer. Seven years after their liaison, John runs into Georgie at a fundraiser. When he stops at her house to return the checkbook she dropped, he discovers his love child and wants to play daddy, even if he has to sue for custody.<br /><br />Despite her misgivings as well as the start of a new romance, Georgie reluctantly invites John into their lives, and soon they are back in bed. When team owner Virgil discovers Lexie's parentage, he issues John an ultimatum - Georgie or the Chinooks.<br /><br />There is also a great secondary romance between her sarcastic business partner, Mae, and hockey goalie, Hugh Miner, who has met his match. I would have liked more of their romance, since it was so funny (and she was so anti-jock).<br /><br />I loved the story (even if it was pretty predictable), but found the constant \\"cryin' all night\\" exclamations from Georgie, and Lexie's constant use of the term \\"gots\\" (cute the first 2 times; annoying and redundant by the 30th utterance) to grate on my nerves.	2005-06-16

He daughter Caitlin was the product of a one night stand and the mother wanted nothing to do with Nate or Caitlin, so he obtained full custody.<br /><br />Part of the charm of the story is how quickly the two can assume their old roles - illustrated by how they immediately refer to each other via the pet names (Peanut and Shadow) they gave each other 15 years earlier. Before they can resume their relationship, she needs to break him of his nasty habit to take care of everyone, and open up and let someone else take the burden for a change, and help him find the thief who has been embezzling from his company.<br /><br />There is a cute secondary romance with the class nerd and a former rock star that took a wrong turn in her career and became an addict.<br /><br />It is a very well written and tender story that will tug at your heart strings.	2005-06-13

While Gabe is trying to recall his past, someone sinister in the background is taking steps to insure that he doesn't remember, and is even prepared to kill if necessary.<br /><br />Melton's SEAL debut is an action-packed romance that'll keep you on the edge of your seat until the exciting conclusion. The plot is reminiscent of an old Linda Howard novel, \\"White Lies\\" about an amnesiac thought to be dead coming home to an estranged wife. Where Howard's story fails, Melton's exceeds, creating plenty of romantic tension between the lead couple. Melton follows the story up with several sequels including \\"In the Dark\\" and \\"Time to Run\\" both of which are excellent romantic suspense novels featuring a SEAL team.	2005-06-07

Will all this clandestine activity wreak havoc on the relationship? Their first (non)date is a hoot, it is a wonder they tried for a second.<br /><br />This is a very humorous look at the wonderful (or pitiful, however you look at it) world of dating via television.

A corrupt raider, he's used to bullying his weight around, but he's not prepared for the lady at the other end of his answering service, orphan Hope Prescott. She assumes when he calls in for messages that he's the butler and strikes up a conversation, immediately making fun of wealthy people, Zack in particular. Zack is completely enchanted by her candor, and decides to keep up the charade. Part of what keeps her working her odd jobs is her quest to reunite her sisters and brother. Thinking that she's carrying on with a man named \\"Griswold,\\" Hope is enchanted with him. When she finds out that he's sick, she shows up on his doorstep with homemade chicken soup. Zack is shocked that such a nice person exists; she's surprised to find that a butler can be so young and sexy. His infatuation soon turns sexual (and of course she's a virgin), but he foolishly continues the charade, which can only come crashing down on him. Circumstances surrounding Hope's background, business enemies, scheming servants, and Zack's inability to trust conspire to keep them apart. Zack will have to be quick on his feet to get her to forgive his sins.<br /><br />About the only thing that detracted from the story was the whole accounting scheme - it just did not fit, and the standoff was kinda dumb. I was also disappointed that the Prescott family was not reunited. I felt a little cheated that I will have to read two more books (also song titles: \\"Almost Like Bring in Love\\" and \\"Close to You\\") to find out how it all turns out!	2005-06-02

Each of the three surviving sisters has moved on to another chapter in their lives and would rather forget the events that led to the tragic death of golden girl, Emily.  Her former roommate and best friend, Natalie bears the brunt of accusations, as the story takes both fact and fiction and concludes that she's a murderer. A chance meeting with her former flame, Cole (who also happens to be Emily's brother), has the two reluctantly joining forces to get to the bottom of the mystery and meet the elusive writer, which only opens even deeper wounds, and causes them to examine their still smoldering feelings for each other.<br /><br />Freethy does a great job of maintaining the suspense and tossing around several red herrings until the actual circumstances of Emily's death are revealed, but ultimately, it is a pretty a prety formulaic novel.	2005-06-02

Kitty has just been dumped by her fiance who'd rather look in the mirror than at her. She reluctantly signs up for a dating service owned by her neighbor after much cajoling, and feels an immediate connection to the person running the agency, Walker Hart (the owners millionaire son).<br /><br />Walker is also intrigued by her, but because of the many, many marriages of his eccentric mother, he doesn't believe in a happily ever after that includes in matrimony. True to his commitment to his new client, he sets her up on five dates. He has conveniently ensconced himself in her apartment when his roof leaks due to a storm. Sure he could have gone to a hotel, but instead he crashes with her.<br /><br />Each is a disaster in its own right - whether she is fending off the advances of a married man, or mistaken as a hooker; at the end of each date, Walker is there to lend an ear. Feeling guilty about one date, he offers a sixth date free.<br /><br />He has a strong attraction to her, and the story never makes it clear if he's purposely picking all the wrong men for her. I loved his klutzyness too. He was always banging into stuff and breaking things. The story is chock full of sophisticated banter, show tunes, and literary quotes, not something you see everyday, thus making it a refreshing change of pace. A great beach read of escape from mundane office work.	2005-06-02

Just a simple touch or feeling can invoke premonitions. When her purse is snatched, and she pursues the 50 year old smoker who outruns her, she gets that feeling, and comes across a mutilated cat in a pentagram. A few nights later, while leaving the theater (her second job), she gets that same feeling, and finds a dumpster with the same pentagram. Her friend calls 911, the cops come and determine that it is human blood.<br /><br />When she is visited by a detective, Clay Sanderson, the lawyer she has a crush on is there to provide counsel. The cynical detective thinks that Tabitha may be involved, especially since he thinks psychics are phony (and there is no body). Clay gets frustrated with Tabitha, because she keeps talking to the cops without him to provide counsel, and investigates the crime, despite his requests no to.<br /><br />She soon hooks up with Lucien Roskell, the owner of a paranormal shop who wants to help her with her \\"gift.\\" He sends her a gift of a scrying mirror, which is supposed to help her with her psychic visions. He also is attracted to Tabitha, much to her gay friend Jeff's delight. When it appears that she is now a target of violence, both men in her life become concerned, and she is forced to move in with a friend temporarily.<br /><br />\\"Dating Can Be Deadly\\" is cleverly written, and is suspenseful - you never really know who the bad guy is until the end. Roberts also does a good job presenting two totally opposite but wonderful men that have feelings for Tabitha. Who she ultimately chooses is also a mystery until the end.	2005-05-31

But he wants to remain true to his self-imposed celibacy, and despite the efforts of all his friends (both male and female), he tries to resist her.<br /><br />Jack is also frustrated with his career. While his true passion is writing, he instead works as a Wall Street banker. He and Sarah have so much in common, as she also is a frustrated artist - she plays the guitar in her spare time.<br /><br />After biting the bullet, he finally asks her out. Unfortunately, a couple days prior to their date, he runs into his ex, Kim, and after a lot of alcohol, and horniness, they fall into bed together a few nights later. He slinks out he next morning and begrudgingly takes Sarah out that night. To his horror, Kim happens to be at that same restaurant and unceremoniously announces to Sarah where she and Jack spent the night and that they are back together. Sarah decides Jack is not worth the trouble and they part.<br /><br />Jack is wracked with guilt over what could have been. He still is fighting his demons but knows that it will take a miracle for him to release himself from demons and self-doubt, and to forge a relationship with Sarah. But would it be worth it?<br /><br />This book is cleverly told from the male point of view with the male as chief protagonist, which makes the story rings so much truer (and is a refreshing change in the normal point of view we usually read about), highlighting the many nuances between the brain activity of men and women. It should be required reading for any gal trying to get into a guy's brain.	2005-05-31

After being passed over for a promotion at work, and tired of running into her sexy ex, she decides to shuck it all and leave San Francisco for an assignment as a reporter in a small Montana town.<br /><br />Soon she is embroiled in a mystery involving dead fish, explosions, the local paper plant, and the EPA. She is also managing to reverse her drought-like love life and suddenly finds she has choices - an environmental activist and a park ranger, but it is the sexy EPA guy that she falls for. He has a young daughter and a not-so-ex-wife.<br /><br />There are lots of great secondary characters, too many of them in fact, which kind of takes away from the overall story, since they are not fully developed and just sort of run together at times. I would have liked to have more depth into her relationship with her best gay husband, Robert, as well as Bruce, the older man she is reticent to get involved with (yet completely smitten). I would have liked more time with the quirky Montana folks as well.<br /><br />Each chapter cleverly starts with an e-mail, which in some cases makes sense, other times I just scratched my head and said \\"huh?\\"  It is a somewhat hysterical fish out of water story, a totally urban gal in the middle of the mountains.<br /><br />The end is abrupt - but definitely leaves an open door for more to come. Great lazy summer or beach read. I managed to finish it in a day.	2005-05-26

She is not happy with her job, has not had a significant romance in quite awhile, and her best friend Darcy (who has always been somewhat of a nemesis), is about to get married to her former classmate, Dex. After a drunken 30th birthday fiesta, Dex and Rachel sleep together.<br /><br />Thinking it was just a one night stand, Rachel tries to pretend that it did not happen. But Dex won't let it rest and soon, they are in the throws of a passionate affair, stealing every moment they can to be together (including time at their Hamptons time-share), all the while assisting Darcy with planning her wedding.<br /><br />It is hard at first to sympathize with what Rachel and Dex are doing, but since Darcy is not exactly the nicest gal (she even stole Rachel's first crush, Ethan, in the fifth grade), but soon the reader is caught up in the relationship and hoping it will turn out in the end. Rachel, who tends to be more of a doormat, is presented as the polar opposite of Darcy in both looks, drive, and personality, and her struggles with her guilt and fear of ruining her friendship with Darcy are drawn so well.<br /><br />It is a rollicking trip through the past and present and Rachel tries to decide her future, with or without Dex and Darcy, and author Giffin keeps us guessing until the end. I particularly loved the pop culture from the 80's. I thought the end was a bit abrupt - not enough of a catfight and in a sense we were left guessing.

She meets chef Dante del Rosso, who encourages her to come in and take a load off. Soon she is helping him woo the local food critic. He thinks she is perfect as is, but she is not biting.<br /><br />Dante is soon in lust with Maria, and manages to insinuate himself in her life by hooking up with her family. She is resistant - she does not want a traditional guy from the neighborhood. But if Dante has his way (and her family and his wait staff...), she will be singing another tune.<br /><br />It is a great contemporary love story with the added bonuses of some incredible mouth watering Italian recipes (with the most hysterical cooking instructions)!	2005-05-25

He has also mortgaged their home, depleted her savings accounts, and as a result of his internet doings, has managed to get her fired from her job as a teacher.<br /><br />With no home, no job, no money, and no man, she turns to best pal Cara, a reporter. Cara's co-workers have all seen the photos and soon her paper creates media buzz by identifying Emily (which results in her inability to get another teaching position) in an article. Cara has her own problems - she is nursing a crush for her co-worker, photographer Alex, a single father contemplating custody of his pre-teen son.<br /><br />While trying to turn her life around, she is soon signed with a publicist who arranges for her to attend several local events.

Unbeknownst to Emily, the man in question is Alex.<br /><br />It is through a series of miscommunication and misunderstandings that events unfold, as Emily struggles with the newfound fame that has been thrust upon her, and her desire for her anonymity restored.

She believes that he was seeing sexy neighbor Aisling within weeks of her departure.<br /><br />When the separation is too much for her, Jo creates an on-line persona, Sarah Daly, so that she can continue to communicate with Daniel. Daniel is soon flirting back with her, mostly because Sarah reminds him of Jo, and he hopes that she can shed some light on what went wrong in the relationship. Despite knowing that what she is doing is wrong, Jo continues to contact Dan, even going so far as to reserve time at the library for a computer when her company folds.<br /><br />It is a cute story about the lengths that we will go to not get hurt, only to probably cause even more pain.

The loss of her birth mother (before she had a chance to meet her) has left some resounding effects on her, particularly her fear of ending up alone.<br /><br />Grace has always been a cool customer when it comes to men after bearing her soul and giving her heart to former paramour (and boss), Michael, only to have him abandon her under the guise that he cannot pursue a relationship with a colleague. When a condom breaks while she is with her current beau Ethan, she realizes she is not so upset about the possibility of becoming a mother, Ethan on the other hand is horrified, which causes Grace to send him packing, while she contemplates single motherhood. She is tired of men that want her in their beds, but not a part of their lives.<br /><br />A chance meeting with her father's colleague Jonathan, at an art gallery sends Grace's pulse soaring, but feels she got the brush off. When they run into each other again, they soon begin to see each other, though she's not sure what she sees behind his mask of ambivalence (though soon all is revealed).  Both of them feeling unlucky in love results in tender and reticent moments as their relationship evolves.<br /><br />Then Michael re-enters the picture, engaged to another employee of the firm, and smarmily comes on to her. It is Grace's final straw and forces her to come to terms with her fear of abandonment, pride, and her possibly unrequited feelings for Jonathan.<br /><br />I did not think this one was quite as good as \\"Engaging Men,\\" but it does stand on its own merits.	2005-05-23

Then she finds it and starts seeing him platonically, though he's more interested in a relationship, and she doubts the first Mike's commitment to the relationship since he wants to remain in California.<br /><br />Each chapter is identified as past or present (1989 versus 2004), and chock full of so many pop culture references to the 80's that late boomers will get a kick out of the trip down memory lane. The past and present flow so well together. As Beau bounces from anecdotes and stories about each Mike, the reader is just not sure which Mike she ended up with. Just when you think you know that it is one Mike, you reconsider and believe it is the other Mike, and then back again. \\"Mike, Mike & Me\\" is a cleverly written and entertaining novel that will keep you guessing.	2005-05-20

Autumn Adams inherited her mother's helpful hints column. She is Martha Stewart crossed with Lucy Ricardo, and has no homemaking skills at all. She would rather kick around a soccer ball than be the face and voice of \\"Homey Helen.\\"<br /><br />She starts to receive death threats from a not-so admiring admirer, and soon a detective is called in to investigate. Chicago police Detective Stacy Quinn is not happy about the assignment which he sees as a fluffy waste of time, but soon he is intrigued by Audie (as she is called by her friends). At their first meeting, she literally falls at his feet when she trips on the camera cords. The two act on their mutual attraction, while he tries to figure out who is trying to kill her.<br /><br />Audie has a lot of relationship issues, and is not used to the intense feelings that Quinn has, and how easy it is for him to express them. When her stalker becomes more diligent, she inverts even further into her own insecurities, compromising their relationship. The two are polar hysterical together and so different. I thought it was hilarious how the roles were reversed - him with the spotless home and loving to cook, while she could manage to set off the smoke alarm while boiling water. He has the big, loving family, while she spent most of her childhood in isolation from her distant mother.<br /><br />The dialogue is crisp and so refreshing (unlike so many books out these days) and you can actually imagine the conversation being real. The secondary characters are fleshed out. And the chemistry between Audie and Quinn is sizzling, with just the right steam quotient.<br /><br />Makes us all curious what men really wear under those kilts!	2005-05-20

Of course his very un-butch poodle, Josephine does not help matters in the romance department, as Julie just assumes he is gay (and when asked, his response \\"does it matter?\\" all but confirms her suspicions).<br /><br />Mac has a long history with Julie's husband and his corrupt family; he suspects them in the disappearance of his older brother and when he found out her hubby was dirty, he ended up being the one framed and kicked off the force.<br /><br />He tries to resist his attraction, but circumstances throw them together, as she starts to depend on him to do more than investigate her husband's extra-marital activities. And soon discovers that his attention to footwear and choice in pets may not be indicative of his sexuality.<br /><br />Plenty of steam in this one, as well as a lot of plot twists. Just when you think you know what is going to happen - a left turn is tossed in for good measure. And Josephine is so well written, she leaps off the pages, literally.	2005-05-16

Disinherited by the father whose love she always sought but never achieved, she returns to collect an inheritance from her aunt. Instead of the family estate, she's relegated to the carriage house where she searches for a hidden valuable work of art.<br /><br />Just about everyone in town is looking forward to her return to even old scores. No one is happier to see her squirm than her former teacher, Colin. Fifteen years earlier, Sugar Beth accused Colin of making a pass at her in order to deflect blame for an embarrassing incident she instigated against her arch nemesis, Winnie Davis. Colin, now a successful writer, resides in her former estate. With no one willing to give her a job, she's stuck working as Colin's maid (which makes for some of the most humorous passages in the novel, particularly when she calls him a prissy Brit and questions his sexuality), and in a turn of events, it's Winnie who is the belle of the town. While Colin entertains revenge fantasies as payback, she disappoints him by rising above it all and swallowing her pride, thereby taking the joy from him. Colin finds himself smitten with this new Sugar Beth, and her former home town finally realizes that she actually may have grown up and deserves to be forgiven for her past sins.<br /><br />SEP cannot be beaten in creating endearing, flawed, and charismatic characters. Her realistic dialogue and gift for plotting make her a standout among her peers. She left the comfort zone of her Chicago Stars series, and yet has created endearing characters that for the most part, you'd want to know. I never expected to like this book as much as I did, which makes it all the more refreshing. I found it to be captivating and was glued to the final page.	2005-05-16

After meeting many Mr. Wrongs, she thinks she finally gets it right when she meets and falls from Matt Baker. Of course, what Lizzie doesn't know is that Matt is in a loveless marriage, either too complacent or too lazy to end it with his wife, Rachel. Upon discovering Matt's deception, she tries to break things off with him, but she's in too deep. Things get further complicated when she discovers that her new pen pal seeking advice on how to save her marriage is Matt's Rachel. Also complicating matters is that her best friend Clare is a recent divorcee, whose husband was incapable of fidelity, feels a sxense of betrayal at Lizzie's actions.<br /><br />What makes this more compelling than most novels about infidelity is that we identify more with the mistress than the wife. Rachel's motivation to keep the marriage going stems more from the need not to fail than love itself. It takes a lot of anguish to find out what happens, but it is worth it in the end.	2005-05-16

Repressed Seattle Times reporter, Jane Alcott (who also writes a soft porn column for a magazine under the nom de plume \\"Honey Pie\\") is chosen for the plum assignment as a traveling reporter with the Seattle Chinook hockey team.<br /><br />She is immediately rejected - none of the players want the petite reporter in the locker room, particularly since she knows little about hockey (except for those quick lessons in the \\"Hockey for Dummies\\" book she bought), and of course, she does not know where to focus her eyes.<br /><br />But no one wants her there less than Luc Martineau, the team's star goalie. He hates reporters due to press problems in his checkered past. He just wants to live a quiet life while caring for his teenage sister. But he cannot resist bantering with Jane and trying to make her blush. Since she is kinda plain and not his type, he wonders why he is so drawn.<br /><br />In an act of defiance after being unceremoniously fired from her job because the team loses a game (those hockey players are a superstitious lot), Jane enters the locker room and gives them all a piece of her mind before dashing out. When they win the game, she is immediately called a good luck charm, and at every game, must perform that same \\"pep talk\\" as a nightly ritual. These scenes are hysterical to say the least.<br /><br />While Honey Pie is sexy and provocative, the real Jane is not. She prefers clothing in all shades of blah - grey and black.  Once she dons a little red dress, she has Luc seeing more than red. Luc and Jane start to see each other secretly. Of course, those Honey Pie articles end up surfacing, causing a rift between them.<br /><br />It is a great story with exciting characters, comical situations, and just the right amount of romance.

She hates her job, does not really care for her roommate, manages to have casual sex with a guy she thinks is creepy, and is lonely since the supposed love of her life (Alex, a would-be rocker), deserted her without word to find himself in America. Alex suddenly returns and wants to resume the relationship.

But Ray managed to bring a little something back from Central America when she discovers that she, the least maternal mammal on the face of the Earth is pregnant.<br /><br />I thought that this was one of Lori Foster's best books. For one thing, it is a stand alone book, and does not have all those awkward paragraphs devoted to explaining relationships when characters from say the Winston books are re-introduced throughout the series. Also, the dialogue is fresh - not cliche-ridden like many of her books. And lets face it, Ray is one bad mama - a flawed heroine we can all admire.<br /><br />For pure escapism, steamy romance, and an adrenaline rush, check this one out.	2005-05-12

Of course, it's hate at first sight for both of them. Overly macho Ben doesn't want to take a woman into unchartered territory, but on the other hand, he doesn't trust the locals to not harm her either, so he reluctantly agrees, and makes several attempts at wooing her. Jillian is no shrinking violet, and she can more than hold her own on the expedition, especially since she is the only one who can read the map.<br /><br />Jillian and Ben has so much chemistry oozing off the pages, and their romance really sizzles. This is one of Linda Howard's better pairings, as the hero and the heroine are definitely equals (and can banter better than most duos).

She thinks that Brad is everything she's ever wanted. Of course he does not turn out to be so perfect.<br /><br />Prior to all this, Jem was overshadowed by her best bud, the willowy Geraldine. And she had a crush on Ben, the office heartthrob, who left for greener pastures as a television presenter. Ben and Jem have a couple platonic nights out before he leaves, and he sort of forgets about her until he realizes his life has not turned out the way he had imagined. He knows nothing about her transformation. He attempts to reconnect with her, and then is bummed when he finds out she has relocated to the colonies. While on a business trip, he attempts to hook up with her. I noticed that many people felt that Ben only liked her after she was thin; I felt that there was already spark, and her being thinner made it more easy for him to act.<br /><br />While parts of the book are dead on accurate, particularly the way that Jem is viewed by society before her transformation and her attempts to befriend Brad's assistant, I thought she lacked judgment. Heck - hasn't anyone who has met an on-line person come across a couple toads (pictures or not)? If it were more accurate, Brad would not have been an Adonis. And to travel all that way... For all she knew, \\"Brad\\" could have been a 13-year old girl named Lisa with bad acne and halitosis.<br /><br />I did not like the message that so many novels about overweight women are sending to readers - lose the weight or you won't get the guy (well, in some cases).

What started as a harmless stunt at the local festival's marriage ceremony the night before he left for the FBI, turned into the real deal when Kitty mailed the prank marriage license to the state capitol, and the marriage became official.<br /><br />After being captivated by Kitty, Dylan questions his own heroism and whether he wants to return to his old job with the Feds or move on to something else. Meanwhile, Dylan's dad, the local judge is having a secret affair with Kitty's mom, who abandoned her when she was a baby. Kitty never really feels good enough based on her family history thanks to lots of small minds in her small town.<br /><br />One of the funniest on-going gags in the book is when Dylan tells Kitty that he is trained in martial arts and knows 600 ways to kill her. Then every time she frustrates him, he repeats a number (#88 is particularly heinous apparently).<br /><br />The story is at times funny, and at times really sad, particularly the tragic incident that turns Dylan into a hero, and which actually causes him to flee the area due to his own guilt. You will laugh out loud (the supermarket grocery cart incident is priceless), root for the secondary characters too. It is a quick and funny read, and you really cannot resist a lawman named Dylan and a madam named Kitty!	2005-05-09

On the night she assumes he is going to propose, he instead dumps her. Out of her home, with no job, she moves back with her folks until she and her 2 friends come up with the idea to move to Antarctica to start over.<br /><br />There were a couple parts of the book that were hilarious - particularly the necessities that they packed, and all the mistakes Clarissa made. But there were far too many extended conversations among the three, and I just could not get into the dialogue - as it droned on and on. There were so many other areas that could have been further expanded on, particularly the post-Kieran relationship with Mitchell, and perhaps some background on why she stayed with him so long in the first place.<br /><br />I was really disappointed in the story. In the right hands, it could have been so much better.	2005-05-04

Each has their own problems and back story, including clueless partners, interfering relatives, and career woes. In a nutshell, each story could comprise its own full blown novel (particularly the stories of Becky and Kelly). Thrown into the mix is a starlet who's returned to Philadelphia to nurse a broken heart, and though the author tries for a little mystery, it does not take a rocket scientist to guess her back story.<br /><br />Although Weiner is an exceptionally gifted storyteller, I felt the novel fell short because there just was not enough plot development due to the overwhelming number of stories that the novel attempts to address, thus the novel seems incomplete. I found myself pretty bored with the characters and wondering \\"who cares\\" as I read the novel, which started to become a chore after awhile.	2005-05-04

They shared a passionate kiss on the eve of her wedding, when she expressed doubts about her wedding. Dylan has managed to keep his distance for the last nine years, only to be thrust back into her world after Gary dies in a tragic car accident. Rachel discovers that Gary might have led a double life and wants Dylan's help in piecing together Gary's last days.<br /><br />Upon arriving at Rachel's family farm, he is saddened to see the frame of the dream house that Gary designed for Rachel.

Little do they both know that they still have feelings for each other, and that passionate kiss is still on both their minds.<br /><br />This is a poignant tale of first love, loss, and finding a way to love again. With a romantic sub-story about a magical apple tree that bears fruit that casts a spell on lovers; according to legend. It also begs the question of who Rachel was really meant to ultimately be with.	2005-05-03

The story starts out with so many possibilities, and is quite humorous. Then suddenly it becomes an industrial espionage story invovling Interpol and becomes so convoluted, that you just want to say \\"enough already!!\\"<br /><br />I was disappointed - had she stuck with the original premise, the story would have been a fresh take on the fairy tales we grew up with.

Tessa fled and went onto a successful career without ever returning home.<br /><br />Alli has always known that Tessa was Sam's first love (and she thinks his only love), but the coincidental separation that she asks for just as Tessa comes to town while their ailing aunt recovers from a debilitating stroke, tests her resolve about her own feelings for the husband she has always loved and who she felt merely tolerated their situation, and the sister she betrayed.<br /><br />When Alli tells Tessa that Sam still loves her, Tessa soon begins imagining her life in their sleepy oceanside town, and quickly forages a relationship with Alli and Sam's daughter.

As an added bonus, the man in charge is a sexy lawyer named Zach Stryker. Nothing can take her off her high; not even her loud boisterous family when she gathers with them for her youngest sister's engagement party. To guard from the numerous pleas to settle down and find herself a man, Katie mentions a possible romance with her new client. Imagine her surprise (or horror) to find that Zach is the father of the groom, and of course her family manages to further humiliate her when they mention that they have heard all about Zach, to his amusement.<br /><br />Zach also has a secret up his sleeve - he hired Katie in hopes she'd be indebted to him enough to help him break up the engagement of his 18 year old son (who was born when Zach was 17). Katie doesn't bow to his threats, and they suddenly find themselves attracted to each other. While she doesn't agree with Mia's choice to get married so young, she doesn't want Zach interfering.<br /><br />The first Marcelli saga is a really engaging and sizzling story that probes into the relationships between Katie and Zach; Zach and David; David and Mia; as well as the entire extended Marcelli family headed by the staunch patriarch \\"Gramps\\", who wants nothing more than a male heir to whom he can pass on the family vineyard.	2005-05-02

Security expert and computer hacker Seth Mackey mistakes her for Victor's lover and proceeds to bug her house as he wants to bring Victor down for the death of his brother and plans to go through Raine to get it done. He becomes fascinated by her and must have her. Neither is sure who they can trust, and both cannot deny the attraction they feel for the other. Then they join forces to bring Victor and his pal Novak down with the aid of the rowdy McCloud brothers (who each get their own story later).<br /><br />Yes, the story is pretty hot, but take out the sex (one scene is 63 pages long) and you have almost no plot and very little character development (in fact, the characters lack consistency from chapter to chapter). I found their first encounter laughable, and Seth overall to be quite creepy. He treats her like dirt one minute then lusts for her the next. The whole ridiculous relationship borders on abuse. A too stupid to live heroine matched with an obsessive stalker does not make a good romance novel. You'll have to read \\"Standing in the Shadows\\" for the conclusion to the story, but that one is just as obsessively bad. I seem to like McKenna best when she migrates away from the McCloud clan - check out her much better \\"Return to Me\\" to see how she can mix eroticism with romance and an actual plot.	2005-04-29

Now a successful photojournalist, he rents a room at the inn owned by his former paramour, Ellen Kent. Ellen was the good girl from the good family. She always believed in and loved Simon. The night he ran away from home (after being accused of starting a fire and destroying a barn), she gave herself to him. But he still left her.<br /><br />Now back together and under the same roof, they both try to ignore the attraction that they still have for each other, and Simon tries to wrestle with his feelings about Ellen's impending wedding to his arch nemesis, Brad, the town golden boy. Will Ellen and Simon succumb to their passion? Will they ever find out what really happened to Gus? Will Ellen ever let her hair down?<br /><br />Since this is a Shannon McKenna book, there is plenty of steam, but also plenty of suspense (much better than Behind Closed Doors).

She is engaged to the school's baseball coach, Bill, and he's crazy for her. Maybe a little too much. Forever picking up strays and finding them new homes, she's suddenly drawn to the ugliest and scrawniest dog she's ever seen. When Bill insists that she take it to the pound, she refuses. Bill takes the dog to the pound himself since he's used to taking control in their relationship, and Quinn promptly sees this a catalyst of their future and calls off the wedding, moves out, and tries life on her own.<br /><br />But Bill has a really hard time realizing that it's over, as he campaigns to reclaim the affections of the woman he loves, to the point of stalking. The normally staid Bill descends into a man over the edge. All this plays out in the gossipy small town in which they live. The school board wants her to get back with Bill so the baseball team can have a championship season. Meanwhile, Quinn's newfound independence is contagious to other members of the community.<br /><br />Quinn turns to best pal Darla, who's having trouble igniting passion in her own marriage, as well as hunky ex-brother-in-law Nick. As Quinn tries to encourage Nick to take a chance with her, Bill is not far behind trying to stake his claim. Nick is the reticent love 'em and leave 'em type - not used to sharing his life since his divorce nearly 20 years early.<br /><br />At times scary, tender, and downright hilarious, this is a great and fast read from cover to cover! Crusie is still the best romance writer at capturing the essence of relationships particularly the dialogue - even in the oddest situations, her crisp dialogue always rings true rather than cliched and dated like many of her contemporaries.	2005-04-28

Rather than move out, he stays, and they become unlikely roommates, as he attempts to come to grips with the breakdown of his marriage and what would cause his wife to turn to a much younger man.<br /><br />Told in the first-person, from Griffin's point of view, it provides a refreshing and poignant look at how time can cause complacency and a sudden jolt can bring about immense change in a relationship. He performs many acts of kindness in an effort to win her back, but as Ellen tells him, it is too little, too late.<br /><br />An impulsive decision to become a department store Santa has a profound effect on Griffin, as he forges new friendships, attempts to jump back into the dating pool, and strives to understand what led Ellen astray and figure out if perhaps his lack of spontaneity drove her away.<br /><br />Eventually, the stress of remaining together as roommates (and Griffin waiting up for her after her dates with \\"Opie\\") takes its toll, and Ellen branches out for a little independence by getting an apartment. The setting might have changed, but the same problems are still there.

She even has the perfect boyfriend who is happy with co-habitation.<br /><br />The opening chapter had me hooked on the book. But as I read further, Joy was not so likeable after all, and it becomes obvious that the Joy that we have been led to believe throughout the book as being so direct, independent, and articulate, is actually somewhat unsympathetic, spineless and not really as engaging as she is purported to be. She's more worried about looking like one of those \\"girlie-girls\\" than actually confronting any of her doubts when it comes to her relationship with her close-knit group of friends and too-good to-be-true Gabe.<br /><br />Throw in some former lovers, frosty in-laws, near overdoses, bouts of jealousy, a possible affair, and a gay bestfriend with a penchant for \\"issue\\" t-shirts, and Joy's doubts sky-rocket, though she won't acknowledge nor address them.<br /><br />I like the first person viewpoint - the readers discovering the truth as the protagonist does. However, after awhile I kept saying - enough thinking and description already - time for some dialogue!<br /><br />On the plus side, Cosper does a great job of differentiating each wedding, to eliminate confusion that could be caused from such a large cast of characters. The villain is great - I was on pins and needles just wondering how Ora would fare by the end. But in the end, I felt cheated by the ambiguous conclusion to the story. It did not have to be happy; it did not have to be sad - just give us some closure.	2005-04-25

At first she's so happy that her pushy mother-in-law is so excited about the nuptials - Ellie lost her own mother 20 years earlier and doesn't have much of a relationship with her father. Linda's a very controlling woman, who never hears the word \\"no.\\"  Dan's reluctant to get in the middle of the two most important women in his life, which later causes terminal angst in Dan and Ellie's relationship.<br /><br />By offering to pay for their wedding, Linda ensures that it'll be the wedding of Linda's dreams, and barely acknowledges Ellie's protestations. The intimate wedding with a handful of guests turns into an enormous society affair. When Ellie becomes pregnant and Linda attempts to once again take over. Ellie is committed to ensuring that Linda knows her role in baby Tom's life, but soon a tragedy occurs, and Ellie cannot forgive Linda for her carelessness, nor Dan, for not standing up to his mother. The tone of the book quickly turns from humorous to somber as Ellie and Dan try to come to terms with their disintegrating relationship. Ellie blames Linda for all their woes, but while Linda is a control freak, Ellie never really stands up to her, allowing herself to be controlled. It's not until she comes to terms with Linda's motivations that Ellie allows herself to forgive the other woman in her husband's life.<br /><br />I felt that the end of the book was a little rushed. We are taken through the trials and tribulations of the ups and downs of Ellie and Dan's relationship, but the last couple chapters seem to abrupt; something is missing. Jane Green has written better.	2005-04-21

He's intrigued by her last entry, where Sam angrily details how Richard made a pass at her the previous night and confessed he wants to have an affair.

Within an hour Ben knows she's Gemma, yet still embarks on a relationship with her, despite his initial interest in Sam. When Sam and Ben finally meet, there is a spark, but Sam isn't willing to act on it, as she considers Ben to be one of Gemma's conquests. Plus, she's mortified at the possibility that Ben read her personal thoughts. When Ben arranges for a blind double date with Sam to prove that there are still some good men left, he finds himself more interested in Sam than his own date. Will Ben follow his heart and pursue Sam? Will Sam drop the icy exterior to open herself up to him?

She also has a penchant for dating men, dumping them, then getting invited to their weddings.  After the third boyfriend in a row calls to advise he is on his way to the altar, Angie decides that she is tired of \\"loosening the lid\\" for other women to pop open, and sets out to make her current beau, Kirk, her betrothed. Though they have been dating for nearly two years, Angie has yet to meet his family who live near Boston.<br /><br />She enlists advice from an old friend from work, who later turns out to not really know what she is talking about. From day one, she plays games with Kirk to become more elusive. It works, and he starts to take the bait. Then Angie wonders, \\"what was I thinking\\" as she evaluates whether or not they are meant to be. She is still trying to find herself and not ready to start a family, while Kirk is a workaholic, driven to succeed with his start up software company, and he is not really supportive of her chosen profession.<br /><br />Angie's family is a hoot - a loud, proud, Italian family from Brooklyn - especially her 84-year old grandmother who is tired of being widowed and steps out with the local butcher, much to Angie and her family's chagrin. They are the polar opposite of Kirk's frosty parents.<br /><br />Is Angie really ready to settle down and settle all for the sake of being married? Is there perhaps someone else she has had feelings for all along?  Maybe someone right under her nose...<br /><br />The only flaw in the book was the lack of depth of some of the characters - particularly Justin and Grace. But given that the book was first person - it is probably understandable. Looking forward to reading the follow up - Bombshell - which highlights Grace's romantic struggles.	2005-04-20

In a covert operation in the mountains of Iran, mission leader \\"Tucker\\" gives Dallas the go ahead to detonate explosives that will result in Dallas' death. Dallas' new wife, Niema Burdock, is an electronics expert on the same mission, and tearfully assumes the guilt over his death for the next five years, living a quiet and solitary existence in an unassuming position at the CIA. When Tucker is re-introduced into her life, she discovers that he is actually John Medina - an elusive black ops agent (first introduced in the novel \\"Kill & Tell\\"). Niema doesn't know that over the last five years, John has silently watched her life from afar, hoping that she can move on with her life and find someone new to love. Since she hasn't, John decides it's time to make his move. But John, who has spent his life in the shadows, assuming one identity after another, has no idea to go about getting close to her. He resorts to what he knows, and convinces her to join his latest mission to capture a French arms dealer. She goes undercover to befriend Louis Ronsard. When introduced into Louis' life, she finds that he's not what she expected at all.<br /><br />The characters are charismatic, but there are so many unexplored chances that could have been fleshed out to make the story more interesting (like the tension between them as they trained for the mission, and the unexplored relationship between Niema and Louis). Overall a good read, despite a love scene that borders on rape and might bother some readers.	2005-04-20

Because her husband is a surgeon, and her best friend (also a doctor) is along, she has no qualms delivering her baby in Mexico. After baby Justin is ripped form her arms in a market, Milla's entire world is turned upside down, with one goal - finding her baby. This causes a rift in her marriage and she and David divorce, and David moves on to raise a new family, while Milla becomes the head of \\"Finders,\\" specializing in locating lost or stolen children. When she isn't tracking lost children, she's fighting off the attentions of True Gallagher, a wealthy businessman smitten with Milla, who tries to buy her affections by making large donations to her organization.<br /><br />A random tip ten years later brings her to rural Mexico and the man she maimed when he stole her baby. An elusive stranger is also tracking this man's movements, as he has graduated from kidnapping to organ poaching. Upon returning to Texas, she seeks this man out to help her. James Diaz is a very complex \\"tracker\\" who always finds his prey. He's a free agent who works for anyone. He joins forces with Milla to try to track down Justin. James and Milla fight their attraction and soon fall into each others arms, until he betrays her.<br /><br />\\"Cry No More\\" is the harrowing tale of a mother's quest to find her chld who vanished without a trace. The last 60 pages of the book are so fraught with emotion, anguish, and turmoil.  While most books would have simply ended with an ambiguous ending, this one instead dug deep into the motivations and passions of James and Milla (and David) so that Milla could open her heart again.	2005-04-20

Recently turned 30, Dig Ryan and his lifelong pal Nadine Kite decide to stop dating inappropriate people and find someone to love. They even make a wager on it to see who is successful first. Told through a series of flashbacks and current events, \\"Thirtynothing\\" captures the essence of first love, unrequited fantasy, and two reluctant people teetering on the brink of responsible adulthood and coming to terms with love and loss.<br /><br />Dig is a record producer of a small independent label.  He is a womanizing (okay, more like a \\"girlizing\\"), fun loving, anal retentive bloke; Nadine, a successful photographer, is brash, independent, and strong willed.  Neither ever dates the right person.  But it is painfully obvious to everyone around them that they belong together. They run into the now grown up woman that stole Dig's heart (and broke Nadine's) when they were teens. Delilah was every adolescent boy's fantasy. And now she was back in London, and separated.<br /><br />Nadine fears that she has lost Dig again, and this time for good. To calm her broken heart, she makes a fateful call to a former boyfriend - one that Dig despises - and somehow ends up back in his clutches. Phil is much more a loser (and ex-con no less) than he ever was. Each is convinced that the other is only doing it because of their bet.<br /><br />The situations were comical - loved Dig's reaction to Delilah paying him the ultimate compliment - naming her dog after him. Of course, the dog is a Yorkshire Terrier - not exactly a gruff or manly dog.  As well as how stressed he got with Delilah's messiness.<br /><br />Yes, you can pretty much see the ending coming a mile away - but it was a great quick read. I was hooked and almost overslept from staying up late to finish it. Unlike so many novels of this genre, the ending is satisfying and gives the reader closure.	2005-04-18

Janice wants to get married and finds the best way to get them is to go to funerals. Sam has just bought a house and is ready to find the right woman to settle down with. And then there is George - he is gay, but wants to have a child and thinks that Katie would be the prefect surrogate.<br /><br />At her birthday party, Katie is shocked to find that the last man she hit on is the love of George's life. When it's discovered that David soon may be deported, Katie decides to marry him to help the guys out so they can stay together (though there's no baby in their future). This doesn't go over well with Janice (who really wanted to get married first) and Sam, who has had unrequited feelings for Katie for a very long time. Katie, who lacks a lot of self esteem manages to take ten steps backwards by juggling two inappropriate guys - her unfaithful ex (who is now about to become a father), and her new 18-year old boy toy. Sam's newest relationship is a thorn in Katie's backside (and I won't even mention that gal's name), as she tries to come to terms with her own burgeoning feelings for Sam.<br /><br />The British slang may take awhile to get used to (especially at first), but overall, it was an enjoyable storyline. But I really didn't like the ambiguous ending.	2005-04-18

The one male voice of reason, Jerry's best friend, Andrew, suddenly becomes more appealing to Jackie as she continues her quest for fulfillment... then Jerry re-enters the picture, and she is in a tailspin all over again.<br /><br />Yes, Jackie is very self absorbed. But that is one of the things that makes her mis-adventures so humorous and poignant. The author really manages to capture her manic and emotional behavior.<br /><br />The ambiguous ending, left me wanting one just more chapter.

Instead of spending time with her best buds in Rome, Casey spends the day with and Italian paramour. She realizes that she misses the romance of the beginning of a relationship, and that she and John are in a rut.<br /><br />While in Greece, the gals clash as Lindsey chases after an Irish bloke who is interested in Casey, and they are caught in a compromising situation after Casey gets bad news from home. Rather than pursue the relationship further, Casey agrees to go to another island with her friends and manages to somehow find herself.<br /><br />There is also a secondary story regarding Kat and her relationship with her stepfather, though it is not fully developed.<br /><br />I liked the storyline - and I pride myself on guessing what is coming next. This is one of those times where I was not right, and it was kind of nice to be surprised. I did not like the ending at all.  Far too ambiguous - not the epilogue most readers are hoping for to wrap things up.	2005-04-18

Maggie is supposedly proud to be the plus size protagonist for the overweight majority of the public, authoring a column on the trials and tribulations of not being thin or obsessed with America's diet culture.<br /><br />And yet, a call from a Hollywood agent and the chance to work with a Hollywood hunk for character development, has Maggie drop kicking her role as the doyenne of the \\"anti-diet\\" movement, instead embarking on a crash diet, outpatient surgery, and exercise routine for 8 weeks before her trip to Hollywood.  She lose 35 pounds and drops 3 sizes, hardly model-thin, but thinner nonetheless.<br /><br />This weight loss suddenly threatens her job, readers, and interoffice friendships. This appears to be the typical storyline whenever an overweight character takes center stage - in order to be fulfilled; you need to shed the weight. I don't like the message it sends (and is right up there with the Jemima J which I liked about as much).<br /><br />Of course she falls into the Hollywood hunk's arms. Of course she ends up with career woes. The story is rather predictable. But despite its flaws, I really liked Maggie and her sarcastic wit.	2005-04-18

All the early interactions with Dante and Louisa are hysterical, as she continually assumes he is the hired help and treats him as such, despite her growing attraction.<br /><br />After a stormy night, they fall into each other's arms.

After finally doing something out of character (by doing something for herself), Ellie dumps her longtime boyfriend. When a hair coloring incident goes awry, she flees to the nearby drugstore to remedy the situation, and her pug Sally is immediately accosted by amorous pooch, Oscar. Of course, Oscar is attached to a very attractive man named Ted, which is just Ellie's luck, considering the state of her appearance. After a second meeting at a banquet, the two start talking and hit it off. At a romantic dinner, Ted and Ellie find that they have a lot in common. Until 52 year old Ted finds out that Ellie is only 29. Ellie's shock at being mistaken for someone older is priceless. Divorced Ted wants nothing to do with the whole \\"I'm in a mid-life crisis so let's get a young chick\\" scenario that so many men his age are currently into, after all, he has his reputation as a news anchor to protect. But Ted cannot seem to deny his feelings for Ellie, as the two live in the same neighborhood and keep bumping into each other. Many misunderstandings result in some poignant and sweet situations, including unsupportive friends and annoying exes.<br /><br />\\"Pushing 30\\" is an engaging and humorous look at the May-December romance between a lawyer (who'd rather be an artist) and a famous newscaster.  It's a great story of one woman's quest for empowerment while bridging the gap into an adult relationship. I really loved this book - I checked it out of the library based on the cover art alone, read it in a day, and decided I wanted my own copy! I like first person narrative - I like seeing a story unfold as the protagonist does, as well as the insight that the narrative provides. This was a great first book - looking forward to starting her next one!	2005-04-14

After a chance meeting with a sexy firefighter at not one but two of her recent events in a single day, she's interested in getting to know him a lot better. Lauren's only flaw (other than jumping to conclusions) is that although she's an awesome wedding planner, her own nuptials ended in divorce (and she's still paying for her ex's excesses). The sparks fly, but she soon realizes that her major wealthy wedding coup has a groom with the same name... Could her Nick be the same Nick that's marrying Darla, the society bridezilla from hell? A series of mishaps and mistaken identities ensue, and Lauren finds herself falling for Nick despite Darla's upcoming nuptials.<br /><br />The story is humorous and cute, and Nick is a very sexy hero. What I found annoying was the constant mention of Lauren's unruly hair. Okay already - uncle, we understand, it has a mind of its own... I liked the pacing of the story and since it's told from Lauren's point of view, we get to find out what's going on right along with Lauren (though I'm sure many a reader saw the truth coming from a mile away).	2005-04-13

Getting him a job and an apartment are the least she can do, since she is convinced that he was innocent. No one is more surprised than Rachel when she picks him up and instead of coming face to face with a gawky teen; a sexy alpha man is waiting for her. As Johnny fights for his right to return to his hometown, and the town heavies try to make his life miserable to drive him out, Rachel finds herself attracted to him, and acting on that passion sends them both on a collision course with the real culprit behind the slayings. When another former lover turns up dead, Johnny is the only suspect, but this time Rachel is his alibi.<br /><br />Much is made about the teacher-student romance, but the age gap is a mere five years (and the romance did not start until both were adults). And do they ever sizzle. But the story is also sensitive, particularly in the dramatization of Johnny's fractured home life. The two make a striking duo, and their story will capture the reader's attention. Despite numerous red herrings and possible suspects, the revelation of the killer was truly implausible and felt like Robards would do anything to keep the culprit a surprise. My first Robards novel, I periodically return to the sizzling story again and again, making Robards an automatic purchase for me.	2005-04-13

Despite being married and having a toddler at home, she takes the assignment and quickly shows her competitive edge and decides that she doesn't merely want to be a participant - she's out to win.<br /><br />Her marriage to lawyer husband Jack has gotten boring and predictable, so the attention she receives, particularly from Chris (the \\"stag\\"), is very welcome. She figures that she'll be stuck with a bunch of desperadoes, but quickly manages to form relationships with women that she might actually hang out with. So we get to spend a lot of the book with Sarah as she tries desperately to find an angle for her story.<br /><br />This one had me hooked from the first page. The writing is so crisp and the author manages to capture all the backstabbing that we all are pretty sure is present in those dating shows, making the secondary characters more than just caricatures. Sarah's many blunders without realizing that she has a camera on her 24/7 were hysterical (especially her comment at the beach before looking horrified at the camera). And Sarah fighting her attraction to her stag, while still remaining true to her husband is a treat to watch. One thing I felt was missing from the book - should have seen the aftermath of the show as well as how Sarah's behavior is received by her family and friends.	2005-04-12

Of course the town was still run by the Rouillard family, and Gray makes it clear to Faith that she is still not welcome.<br /><br />Faith has always carried a torch for Gray, who is about eight years older. He had a difficult time coming to terms with his own attraction to her the night that she was evicted, she being 14 and all.  While he tries to squash her plans and his own growing desire, they eventually find themselves in each other's arms, as someone else seems to be hell bent on getting Faith out of town and away from the truth of what precipitated that fateful night 12 years ago.  Of course, he was quite a misogynistic jerk, so I could not relate to her attraction to him, particularly his heartless reaction to her sexual prowess the first time they were together.

Of course, Jack thwarts those attempts, by standing behind her in line and requesting that she hurry along, only to have no items to purchase. This results in town rumor mill assuming it's he who she's bedding down (thus no longer available to the local males).<br /><br />She manages to strike the eye of the bad guys, when she unwittingly witnesses a murder outside the club.

Lucas is a very funny lead. He is a typical macho American hero, with strong opinions about everything. Particularly funny is the constant revolving door of automobiles he drives while on assignment. Although some readers may find Lily's job strange for a heroine, Lily never really questions it, as she has always worked for the government and has only taken out \\"bad\\" people. But not everyone is who they appear to be and the unpredictable ending is the result of so many plot twists and turns.	2005-04-11

As the president of actor Joshua Reed's fan club, Leanne never figured she'd get to meet her idol in person, but a chance meeting with the actor and his publicists results in a life altering experience for all.  Of course, instead of the charismatic hero she's read about, he turns out to be foul mouthed, surly, and pretty much a drunk. After getting his second DUI (thus requiring jail time), Leanne arranges to having his sentence reduced to house arrest in her family's home. What results is a fish out of water tale where the arrogant actor is forced to come to terms with the bad choices he's made. It also forces Leanne to look at her own choices (she gave up on the dream of college to care for her disabled brother and perennially depressed mother), in an effort to decide her future. Joshua turns out to be more than she or her family bargained for and instead of looking forward to spending time with him, she starts counting the days until he'll leave, all the while pinning after her unrequited crush, who Joshua's team also has their eyes on.<br /><br />New author Cochran has written a witty and poignant story. You'll find yourself looking at those Hollywood bad boys in a new light, though this is clearly Leanne's tale.	2005-04-11

The book is cleverly written as a tell-all autobiography from the wife's point of view.<br /><br />Kyra Felis is a native New Yorker and would-be fashion designer whose chance meeting of struggling Irish actor, Declan McKenna, in a Las Vegas casino results in tabloid fodder of an affair (he is currently linked to his piranha-like leading lady, Lauren). After sending an apologetic e-mail to Kyra, he mentions that he will be in New York for location shooting and would like to get together. They meet and immediately fall in love, and she is suddenly moving to LA to marry him.<br /><br />They manage to have a small amount of time to enjoy each other until an independent film he starred in a few years earlier is released to great press, and he becomes an \\"overnight\\" sensation. This causes tremendous strain on their marriage, as she is suddenly thrust into the media spotlight and is followed by paparazzi and forced to contend with her husband's PR machine.<br /><br />They are forced to move from their beloved apartment on the beach to a fortress in the Hollywood Hills. Suddenly she does not know who she can trust; who is a friend and who is a hanger on?  Meanwhile, her star as a fashion designer rises, but she secretly wonders if she is merely riding on the coattails of her famous husband.<br /><br />Eventually Lauren re-appears and wants Declan back. While Kyra knows in her heart that all those stories romantically linking Declan and Lauren in the press are fabrications, the relationship is slowly put through the wringer until she finally decides that she has had enough and flees back to New York. Will Declan choose fame over love? Lauren over Kyra? Will Kyra and Declan settle their differences and realize they were meant to be together?<br /><br />Not up until the last page does the reader know the outcome of this witty tell all.

A heart wrenching saga of the first year of living without her husband, \\"Good Grief\\" draws in the reader with emotion and empathy.  The book is separated into sections with clever titles such as \\"anger,\\" \\"grief,\\" etc.<br /><br />Sophie Stanton is a 36-year old PR exec for a pharmaceutical company in California's Silicon Valley.  She has recently returned to work after her husband, Ethan, succumbs to cancer.  She is a walking zombie, and cannot find the strength to bring herself out of the funk that she is feeling.  To get her through the night, she sleeps with his ratty ski sweater.<br /><br />Her mother-in-law wants her to pack up Ethan's stuff and move on; her best friend wants her to come up to Oregon and stay with her awhile. Her father wants her to come live in Vermont with him and his new wife. After a disastrous and pain-filled Thanksgiving weekend Sophie finally returns to work, in her pajamas and bunny slippers (the cover photo is what got me to get the book - the fact that it was good was a bonus).  Her company decides to put her on medical leave.  She takes the time to re-evaluate her life and decides to sell her house and move up to Ashland, Oregon as a change of scenery.<br /><br />Her grief is so present throughout the book, and so heartbreakingly raw.  She eventually carves out a whole new life for herself, getting a place to stay, a series of jobs, a strange big-sister/little-sister relationship with a disturbed teenager, and of course, a new romance.  All the while, she feels a sense of betrayal for moving on without Ethan. But she maintains her sense of wry humor throughout (on an application asking who to contact in case of emergency, she writes \\"George Clooney\\").<br /><br />I loved how even the smallest details of life can make you think of a loved one. I especially like that through all her pain and suffering and constantly putting Ethan on a pedestal, Sophie realizes, as we all do, that when someone dies, they are automatically relegated to perfect status.  While she loved Ethan with her heart and soul, she realizes that he was by no means perfect.<br /><br />This book spoke to me on so many levels - it will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  It will also make you really, really hungry.Ethan with her heart and soul, she realizes that he was by no means perfect.

While it takes a long time to get used to the writing style (a combination of narrative, \\"sidebars\\" for background, poetry, e-mails, and dialog from screenplays), \\"Inappropriate Men,\\" turns out to be an interesting and quick read (especially if you skip all that pedestrian poetry like I did).<br /><br />Sidney Stein is a sensual and plump 30-something free spirit currently teaching at a Chicago college and clearly unhappy in her marriage to her college sweetheart. She begins an affair with Geoffrey, her father's married law partner, a man 23 years her senior who unleashes her long-buried passion. Before her marriage to Mark, she managed to bed down lovers in the double digits.<br /><br />After she and her husband part amicably, she continues to see Geoffrey, and he continues to remain with his wife, with no intention of ever divorcing or leaving her. Despite knowing there is no future with him, she continues to take whatever morsels of his time he is willing to give her, as she begins to fall in love with him. Of course, they are lucky to spend more than 8 hours together in a single month.<br /><br />After confessing her relationship to her brother and best friends, she follows their advice and puts a personal ad in a local paper and jumps into the dating pool.  Her dating escapades are hysterical, as is a painfully bad sexual encounter with her first lover since Geoffrey. But unfortunately, there are too few of them.<br /><br />I was disconcerted with the book's description - it gave you the impression that after dumping her married lover, her blind dates from hell would constitute a large portion of the book, instead, just more drivel and whining about Geoffrey, who she finally does dump almost 3/4 of the way through the book. A former flame and unrequited love also come into the fold with unexpected results. I loved the bantering relationship between Sid and her brother; I liked that a woman can be a sexual being despite her size; and I also liked the ambiguous ending. But overall, the story was lacking and thus a disappointment. Without the hideous poetry, it is a solid 3 star read.as lacking and thus a disappointment.

After Freya's latest relationship disaster, Jack lets her move in with him temporarily. Soon, the two begin to get on each other's nerves, and sabotage each other's new relationships. She's disgusted that he dates really young women, including one of his workshop students (with a pierced tongue no less...); he's tired of her inflexible attitude about others.<br /><br />Freya is searching desperately to find a new man to take to her conniving step-sister's English wedding. After meeting a lot of Mr. Wrong's and managing to humiliate herself at almost every turn, she asks Jack to accompany her. After discovering he's going to be cut off by his womanizing father, Jack decides to take a break from his writer's block and agrees to go to England as her significant other. While in England, Jack and Freya's relationship suddenly takes a different turn, as the two discover that they have unresolved feelings for each other that they never explored. And Jack's act of betrayal tests the limits of their friendship.<br /><br />I liked the story, the secondary characters, and Sisman's witty writing style. But I didn't like the ambiguous ending.

Her favorite feature is her odd taste in footwear, and the belief that a girl can never have too many shoes. She just broke up with her boyfriend David (though never making the plunge and sleeping with him). The only thing that depresses her about her breakup with David is that she won't have a date to his sisters wedding.<br /><br />While at a bar, her friends goad her into walking up to a cute guy - Cal Morrissey, a serial dater afraid of commitment who just broke up with his therapist girlfriend. As she makes her way to Cal, she inadvertently overhears David making a bet with him that he cannot bed the girl in the grey suit within a month. Being the gal in the grey suit, she's shocked at first, but decides two can play that game, and sets out to make Cal's life miserable for that month (and heck, he'll make a cute date for the wedding). What she doesn't realize is that he didn't take the bet, but rather just bet that he could leave with her (for $10). Though their dinner date is a bust, circumstances keep throwing the two together, and Cal and Minn slowly start to develop feelings for each other - but Minn is still hurt because of the bet. Cal is mystified that his regular charm doesn't work on her - she seems immune. The big question is whether the two can weather the storm and discover their true feelings.<br /><br />With dialogue so witty and fresh that you can really imagine the conversations actually taking place, it'll have you craving chicken Marsala and Krispy Kremes. Despite their flaws, there is great chemistry between Minn and Cal. \\"Bet Me\\" was the first book I read by Jennifer Crusie.

It's because of these talents that he's called upon to insure a takeover of Houston-based Bronson Alloys, by any means necessary. After researching the company, he determines that the weak link is Claire Westbrook, the secretary for Bronson. Claire has been unlucky in love and doesn't trust men since her painful divorce from her wealthy ex-husband. But Max pursues her, as he tries to elicit confidential information from her. After a night of passion, he is called away the next morning on business without any explanation. Before she knows it, the company is in ruins thanks to a hostile takeover and Max might be behind it. When she is reassigned to the new office, will she allow herself to be burned a second time?<br /><br />\\"Almost Forever\\" is a follow up to \\"Sarah's Child\\" and very characteristic of early Linda Howard books - where the cookie-cutter plot is predictable and the characters are a little cliched and not fully developed. The dialogue is trite and the heroine a little too wimpy. While Max is not your typical alpha male, he was much more likable as a potential love interest for the heroine in \\"Sarah,\\" that I did not recognize him in this story.	2005-03-28

It's been almost a year since her fiance dumped her the night before their wedding. A chance run-in with him has her feeling nothing but self pity, until a kind stranger comes to her rescue.<br /><br />Enter Alex: sensitive, successful, and very attractive. They spark up a conversation, and the next thing you know, they are dating. Gwen thinks that she may have found The One. They manage to discuss just about everything, including former lovers, and soon discovers that he was on the verge of proposing to a soap queen named Harmony until he realized that she was a real head case. As she and Alex get to know each other, she discovers they have so much in common, and he just seems too good to be true.<br /><br />Enter Leo: wily, troubled, with a penchant for all things Spiderman. He also happens to be the love child of said soap actress, Harmony, and Alex (though he's not aware of Leo's existence).<br /><br />Should Gwen break doctor-patient confidentiality and tell Alex about Leo? Should she continue her relationship with him? All bets are off when flaky Harmony decides to spill the beans because her mystical guru tells her that she and Alex should raise Leo as a family. She wants to reconcile, and after meeting Leo, and since Alex is the product of a broken home, it is not surprising what he chooses to do, despite his strong feelings for Gwen, who's suddenly on the receiving end of getting dumped. Again.<br /><br />But of course, Alex still has strong feelings for Gwen, and wants to continue a friendship with her if nothing more. What follows are comical coincidences and misunderstandings that keep pushing the two together, even though they each decide to keep their distance.<br /><br />This is more than a romance novel. It's also about parenthood (reluctant and expectant), friendship, loyalty, and the importance of having a good colorist.	2005-03-28

And then suddenly, the cops are called in and foul play is suspected.<br /><br />I loved the references to old movies and movie stars and the hysterical conversations between David and Callie. It was so funny how she exasperated him and drove him crazy, and why his attraction to her kept growing (if I had his fianc&eacute; to look forward to, I would want someone loopy too!) each time they spent time together.

Keeley Murdock is a successful interior designer who on the eve of her wedding to one of the most eligible bachelors in town (AJ Jernigan), discovers that he has been carrying on with her best friend and maid of honor. After throwing a hissy fit, as well as some expensive crystal and china, she calls the wedding off.<br /><br />Soon, her business is feeling the effects of her broken engagement, as AJ's family starts putting pressure on her clients while AJ is off on their honeymoon with his friend (not the town tramp). Will Mahoney is the new guy in town.  He has just bought the local bra plant, as well as a dilapidated antebellum mansion. He offers to help Keeley out of her debt problem - by renovating the mansion so that he can win the woman of his dreams that he saw once answering the phone on a local telethon. Despite thinking he is a fruitcake, as well as being given an impossibly tight six-month deadline, she takes him up on the offer.<br /><br />Introducing another male into the mix would automatically make a reader assume that she will have a new love interest - not in the case, as Will is smitten and determined to make Stephanie - the ice queen from Atlanta - his bride and whisk her off to live in the country. After an initial meeting, where it is obvious that the woman is out for one thing only (\\"what is his net worth, pre-tax?\\"), and who has the taste of a Vegas bordello owner, Keeley stays on the job despite the clash of tastes, all the while, Will is oblivious to the deviousness of his soon-to-be-bride who has no intentions of giving up her big city life to settle in the country.<br /><br />The story is fresh and funny, and could have been so much more. Unfortunately, so many pages are devoted to the quest for furniture and trips around the south to discover the whereabouts of Keeley's long-lost mother (no surprises there - saw that coming a mile away). While the closure that Keeley seeks from the loss of her mother plays a pivotal role in her being able to move on, the long-winded shopping excursions wore me out.  After awhile, I just skipped several pages.<br /><br />I liked that AJ had some redeeming qualities - it would have been easy to hate him, but he manages to not be such a bad guy after all. And he is determined to redeem himself in Keeley's eyes. I would have liked to see the tense relationship between Keeley and Will fleshed out more, as well as a little more background on what would make such a great businessman and likeable guy such a stooge when it came to a woman as transparent as Stephanie. Will is a one-dimensional character, and so much more could have been hammered out to give him a little depth.<br /><br />Of course, that did not keep me from reading it in a single night!

There were about seven points of view, which was just too many.  The primary relationship was between two motherless sisters - Rose, the practical and smart one, and Maggie, the pretty and ditsy one.  I found it very difficult to like Maggie.  She was slutty and conniving and there was very little to like about her, even as she came to terms with her dyslexia and finally managed to grow up (of course with the help of others).  Maggie's self-destruction resulted in the ultimate betrayal of her ever-forgiving (but FINALLY fed up sister), seeking vengeance due to deep-seated jealousy of Rose by seducing her boyfriend.  This prompted Rose to stop being the long-absent mother to her needy sister and take care of herself.<br /><br />Far too much time was spent with Ella, the estranged grandmother.  She could easily have been scaled back to make more room for what made the relationship between the two sisters tick.<br /><br />Rose's sudden career change was odd, particularly from someone that we know is totally career driven.  And the new man in her life, well that was never fleshed out.  It should have been delved into deeper.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the movie version - perhaps a lot of the superfluous stuff will be left out to keep it in at a respectable time limit.  And hopefully they will keep the time at the Shady Rest... er rather the Golden Acres to a minimum.	2005-03-08

You will probably relate to the chief protagonist, Cannie Shapiro, an accomplished woman who doubts all those accomplishments due to her lack of self-esteem.  She thought she kept it in check, only to have revealed for all the world to see in a national publication by a former lover.  \\"Good in Bed\\" follows her plight for self-discovery, and all the bumps and barriers that manage to get in the way once he vaguely identifies her in an article titled \\"Loving a Larger Woman.\\"  While the story takes a pretty implausible turn to Hollywood, the rest of the story is bittersweet and keeps the reader glued, hoping for a happy outcome.<br /><br />After her boyfriend's article appears, she at first is angry, then she reads it and is touched by the love that he describes feeling for her, and his lack of ability to protect her from a world that still believes that what you are on the outside determines what you are on the inside.  And so goes the quest to get back the man that she believes loved and understood her better than any other.<br /><br />I loved that the book was entirely first person - we got to see, hear and feel everything as Cannie did.  Her relationship with her diet doctor is very funny.  When she makes smart aleck comments, you can almost feel his smile as he tries not to laugh at her.  I particularly liked the heartfelt discussion of why she never sought a drastic diet before - she never really thought that she looked that bad, that it took the jolt of an article to bring all that self-doubt to the surface.<br /><br />The writing is so crisp and fresh.  Each character has a specific way of speaking, and whether they are a doctor, a messenger, a cheerleader-nurse, or a phen-phen obsessed dieter, each voice is different.<br /><br />What I love most this book is that Cannie, while flawed, didn't have to drop the weight that contributes to their lack of confidence (unlike Jemima J). She picks herself up; dusts herself off, and becomes an even stronger person as she learns about love, loss, and forgiveness.  And this book automatically gets 5 stars just for having a dog by the name of Nifkin.<br /><br />Hopefully, Hollywood will discover this gem too!omes an even stronger person as she learns about love, loss, and forgiveness.

There's also a lot of attention to detail for the secondary characters - they are all so well fleshed out. The initial \\"romantic\\" encounter between Sophie and Phin is the stuff that romance dramas thrive on, and I had misgivings at first (I thought I was reading a Harlequin romance novel), but then Crusie hooked me in with her inventive prose (and more inventive imagination). And she has a great knack for Dusty Springfield and goofy movie quotes (I found myself trying to guess the movie too!)<br /><br />Crusie brings a mixture of romance, emotion, mystery and plotting to tell an engaging story of how two lost people manage to find each other in a storm of controversy.

I remember this book vividly from my childhood.  My mother read it to my sister and I on rainy days. It is the story of a girl named Sophie who is visited by a hungry tiger with a voracious appetite for tea and biscuits.  He ends up eating everything in the cupboards to satisfy his appetite.<br />It is a sweet story that is easy to follow and read along with your mom, or if you are like me, read all by yourself now that you are an adult.  It made me not only want to have a pet tiger, but it made me want to travel to Europe, where the book is set.  Sadly, I still do not have a pet tiger, but I have traveled to Europe!<br />If you are lucky enough to find it in stock - snatch it up quick - they go really fast!	2003-06-18
