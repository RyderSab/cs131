In short, as someone who knew nothing about the actual subject matter I loved the STORY--but I suspect that Muslims or Pakistanis might have reason to be offended.	2005-05-15

I guess the book blocs are so simple that don't overtax her attention span, but still have the quality of being books. Apparently she has learned to recognize several letters in only a week!

The software loads quickly and is simple to use. The texts are brief and accurate, written at the level of a solid high school student or entry level college student. The CD Rom is arranged so you can break up the narrative in order to seek out sections of Luther's life or details on particular issues. Some of the animations are great (e.g., demonstrating what happens to souls after death according to medieval theological views), but the animated film that accompanies all of the sections is JUST PLAIN WEIRD. Scholars may be bothered that it is hard to figure out the sources of all the pictures or texts, but students unfamiliar with Luther will probably learn something. The material is not exciting, but it is very solid.	2004-02-10

I started it late at night and couldn't put it down until I finished.  Millett's description of her mother and the differences in perception (what the hospital thinks about her mother, what her sister thinks, what she thinks) are fascinating, as is the way that she details how nursing homes aggregate power to themselves.  If you are thinking of nursing home care for aged parents, this would be a good book for you to read; it is well written and baldly presents some of the real dangers involved in powers of attorney for the elderly.  I have to say, though, that as the book went on I liked the author less and less.  She is so uncompromisingly extreme--and I disagree that she earned our respect by what she did for her mother.  What she basically did was, come home for a month and pre-empt her mother's care, after her elder sister had been doing it for years.  Classic case of the child who is completely not involved in the ongoing narrative of care rushing in at the end to disrupt all of the arrangements.  Frankly, if I were her sister or cousin who had been doing the care of their mother I would have wanted to run her out of town.  NOthing is ever half way with Kate: the Reagan gov't is evil, the Golf War was an imperialistic measure by the oil interests, etc., etc.  Unfortunately she contradicts herself at the end of the book; she spends the first 100 pages bemoaning how little money she earned in her life and then begrudges the fulltime care taker for her mother the measly $1100 she wants to babysit 40 hours a week; in other words, she complains about her financial situation and is hesitant to pay her mother's caretaker the very lowest living wage--and it's not like Kate is stopping her life to take of her mother, oh no.  She criticizes anyone and everyone in the book who is concerned about individual success, arguing for a socialist collective, but in the end, it's Kate Millett's individual wants and needs, no matter how carefully theyare formulated as an argument for her mother's independence, that take precedence.	2002-01-16

Weber wrote 15 books about the Malones from 1943-1969, which are now reissueed by Image-Cascade.  The books are sturdy editions of the classics which even have the pictures from the dustcover printed on the paperback bindings, a particularly nice touch for those of us who remember the classic dustcovers.  If you want to buy them all you might buy directly from the publisher as they offer a discount if you buy the entire series.<br />On the books: this is a very wholesome series from the post-war, baby boom days when older teenagers of the middle classes were just beginning to debate the question of dating behavior, independence from parents, early marriage and sexual activity. Each book centers around one sort of moral dilemma that organizes the action of the characters  In this book we are introduced to the Malone family when their widowed father has to be away for sometime and their stepgrandmother comes to pick up the slack and organize their lives for them.  How each of the Malone children from the oldest, recently married Elizabeth, to horseriding Mary Fred, historian Johnny, and determined housewifely youngest daughter Catherine Cecilia or &quot;Beany&quot; as she is known to all and sundry, deal with the question of independence and self-determination is the theme of this particular book. The series carries us through several of Beany's boyfriends and her search for an ideal, sensible mate, ending in a last novel that discusses a point very early in her marriage to Mr. Right, Carlton Buell. The plot devices of the books are rather formulaic; they often turn on information one character has and does not share with the others, or a belief that one character has that turns out to be wrong.  Characterization is very flat and unsophisticated and as the series goes on, there is a great deal of repetition of characterization devices that takes up more and more of the book each time.  But these books were beloved in their age and are definitely nostalgic to read again. Still, they take us back to a  point in American history that has a reputation of being a peaceful era and we see that even before Vietnam and the 1960s teenagers were dealing with moral dilemmas and wondering how best to grow up.  Beany and her siblings also provide good moral examples, since they always struggle but in the end do the right thing.  Strongly recommended, even they are a bit oldfashioned nowadays.	2002-01-12

The story isn't really interesting enough to be a novel--you read it avidly at first because you think it's a &quot;real story&quot;--but as the author notes at the beginning, she changed dates, names, circumstances supposedly to improve the story (well, she should have changed a lot more then).  But then when you begin looking at the &quot;evidence&quot; printed as illustrations you notice that she (or her genealogist?) made mistakes in transcribing the French, includes names in her transcriptions that aren't really in the sources, and she repeatedly notes errors in her primary sources as well.  To a real historian this smacks of someone changing her sources to make her imagined story fit.  Real historians accept that they can't always trace the neat trail they would like to--Tademy just changes things to make them fit her story and thinks, I guess that the reader won't even notice. She doesn't even provide real reproductions of the newspaper articles she shows &quot;photographs&quot; of--they're just transcripts typed in a modern font.  Anyway, I found myself wondering how much of the story was at all findable in primary documents.  When I decided she more or less made this up out of whole cloth and her ideas of how her descendants could be, I got really bored with the sort of nonexistent plot.  If you want real literature about the slave experience, read Alice Walker.  If you want real history, read Ball's book about the slaves in his family.  This apparent hybrid is neither, and as such it is a waste of time. If I were Jonathan Franzen I would definitely not want anything I wrote on the same list with this work of dubious value.	2001-12-27

It makes sense and it works.  He even talks about reasons that people want to resist this truth, and how to trick yourself out of your writer's block.  Grad students especially should benefit from the strategies he suggests.	2001-12-16

The author reviews the various solutions, (Counter-Reformation, Catholic Reformation, Catholic Reform, Catholic Confessionalization, Catholic Revival) and the history of the use of those terms.  Then he proposes an additional term: &quot;early modern Catholicism,&quot; which should be used besides all of the others.  This begs the question, of course, of what exactly &quot;early modern&quot; means--a not entirely uncontroversial term in itself.  The best part of the book is the reviews of where the current terms came from historically and why they were used.  The solution is less compelling, simply because words like Counter-Reformation and Catholic Reformation are not only well-dispersed and easily understood, but they are still meaningful to the people who are using them.  Also, the writer intentionally stays out of evidential debates by saying &quot;that's material for a longer book&quot;.  This is really a book about historiography--if you want info about the Catholic Ref., check out Bireley or Hsia or Mullett.  On the other hand, this would be a really great book for graduate students who need a quick update on this info for their exams.	2001-12-16

However, his portraits of figures like Oppenheimer and Heisenberg are way off--extreme readings of uncited evidence that is frankly in conflict with both the historical record and the way that contemporary historians interpret it.  Heisenberg was NOT a convinced Nazi--he was a German nationalist.  There's a difference.  Oppenheimer's personality problems were not at the basis of his later exclusion from further government nuclear research--his communist sympathies were the reason.  Bodanis makes Teller sound like a crazy and not like the venerable scientist he was.  What's sad about all of these misportraits is that they cast doubt on things I want to believe, about Lise Meitner and Celia Payne, for example.  Read with care, and compare to a real book about the Manhattan Project (like Richard Rhodes' &quot;Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot;) before you swallow this picture whole. For a much more balanced picture of some of the personalities involved that includes a readable account of the science, check out Freeman Dyson's &quot;Disturbing the Universe.&quot;	2001-10-17

I have complained before and will again about how badly Havers routinely gets treated, about the author's misogyny, her bizarre adoration for some very shallow upperclass characters she created, and her attitude toward Americans.  This time I can add her open and cruel hate for fat characters--in the first scene, a character gets run over because she is too fat to run out of the way of a car.  Give me a break.  All of that I could forgive because once upon a time, George wrote a good story.  No more.  it was impossible to be interested in the main characters of the mystery, the myster was confusing and seemed to have so many red herrings that it signaled a lack of control of the narrative on the writer's part.

Wheeler quotes this adage and provides some fascinating insights into it from her own perspective, noting that her wanderlust comes from her fear of losing her faith if she lives too long and home and is forced to confront the sad realities of daily life.  I feel the same way and had never heard it expressed so beautifully.  This is a fine travel book that provides an interesting contrast to recent works on the physical conquest of Antarctica, for this is about the mental conquest of this strange continent.  I have read many books about Antarctic exploration but this is the first one that made me want to go myself.  I especially appreciated her comments on the disjointed feeling the traveler has when leaving the country she's just visited. Travel literature isn't supposed to be about the country you're visiting (that's what guidbooks are for)--this kind of writing is much more interesting and lasting.	2000-12-04

Plotwise:  I thought this book got pretty boring in the last forty pages or so, after Cindy was captured.  Kellerman's strength is the whodunit and not writing about hostage situations, I think.

The story  does not suffer here at all (and in the beginning I read these novels for  the story), but it's the feel of the book as a whole that is so satisfying,  the picture of life around New Orleans, the vignettes of Dave's  relationships, and the landscape of the novel.  Especially gratifying were  the fleshing out of the Clete Purcel character and learning more about  Dave's childhood and his relationships; especially convincing, the  description of the ongoing effect of (dry) alcoholism on Dave's  relationships.  I would love to see more in the next book about Alafair,  Dave's daughter; or a book that concentrates more intensively on Dave's  relationship with Bootsie.  In typical Burke fashion, the characters get  killed off with increasingly speed until there are only a few possibilities  for finding &quot;whodunit&quot;, but in this case the end is not only  exciting, it refuses to descent into the typically moralistic cliches of  detective fiction.  An incredibly enjoyable read.	2000-09-10

She somehow knows  better than all of the politicians who participated in the actual events  (e.g., terming Roosevelt's decisions during the yalta conference  &quot;criminally ignorant&quot;).

The best aspect of the book was Geli's sarcastic humor, which I really enjoyed.  The book has two major flaws, however:  the first is that it's too  educational--Hansen builds in all this information about different figures  in the Nazi party very poorly.  We heard that through gossip, Geli learns  something, and what she learns turns out to be a sort of encyclopedic  presentation of the history of these people.  Secondly, I think Hansen  makes the explanation of Hitler's sexuality much too one-dimensional.  As  Hansen acknowledges in his afterword, there are many different ideas about  this issue, and the selection of this one scenario is unartistically and  porrly presented.  Hansen mentions the book &quot;Explaining Hitler,&quot;  which, although a work of non-fiction, does a better job of presenting the  ambiguities of this whole situation.  Because the book is so concerned with  getting every little detail correct, it lacks the dreamy, hazy quality of  the presentation in Mariette in Ecstasy (which, because I liked it so much,  was the reason that I read this).	2000-04-30

I began by looking up some of my favorite poets and reading about then, then reading some of the work of their contemporires that Schmidt describes.  In other  words, the strength of the book for me was that impetus to rediscover the  lesserknown poems of poets I've always liked and the concomitant discover  of new poets with whom I was unfamiliar.  That's why I say it's a bedside  book; you can browse in it while snuggled up and then jot down some new  poetry to check out on your next visit to the library.  A worthwhile  investment for the library of any scholar or intellectual, and especially  strong on the poets of the first 2/3 of the twentieth century.	2000-04-29

Some of the books are better at it than others.  When the  Chandler style takes over, you end up with conversations that are little  more than a series of one-liners--this book tends in that direction,  although the repeated telephone psychology conversations (which don't fit  the Chandler model) do help to keep real conversation going.  I thought the  plot was interesting although you could see the ending coming for quite  awhile and the end of the book was abrupt.  I felt a little as if he were  recycling elements of other successful books here; the strong gay  character, or the hostage holding (from Looking for Rachel Wallace).    I,  too, missed Hawk.  But I liked the more conversational, vocal style.	2000-04-15

A particularly cheering  feature is the amount of time the author spends on Berlin from its  foundation to the 1840s, a period that many other authors either rush over  or treat poorly.  Moreover, in limiting himself to the most significant and  representative works or artists in each period, Taylor leaves a lasting  impression at the end of every chapter--there's a lot of information here,  but it's organized so as not to be overwhelming, and particularly the  repeated pattern of literature, music, art, architecture, is helpful.

This is a recent trend in Holocaust literature (the mixing  of memoir and fiction) and it's not necessarily bad (although it's  troublesome if you're trying to teach a history class on the Holocaust),  but it should be noted.	2000-04-01

Also, the narrative is  compelling and the conflicts the author sets up are truly believable and  interesting.  I think what's troubling about this book is that we're  expecting an &quot;immigrant success story&quot; like we're used to reading  and that's not what Hegi gives us--instead we have sort of more of the  &quot;good family in decline&quot; motif of Thomas Mann's _Buddenbrooks_.   I was also gratified that some loose ends from _Stones in the River_ were  picked up, although I would agree with other reviewers that this book isn't  as thrilling.  I suspect that may have to do with the period and location  it covers--the perception of WWII by Americans in the US is probably  inherently less exciting than WWII experiences within Germany.  Worth  reading.	2000-03-29
US	51075980	RK86NRW3CCXL2	0385491247	559678955	A Stolen Tongue	Books	4	24	27	N	Y	Interesting and exciting but not accurate in all regards	A quick note to the reviewer before me:  whether you spell Catherine with K or C has to do with the tradition you come from:  C is the Latin spelling, which made its way into English and French; K comes from the  Greek, which made its way into German (English is influenced by both of  these traditions so we see both of these spellings in English).  Felix  Fabri is a German so it's not improbable that he would refer to Katherine  with a K; &quot;the Tongue,&quot; Arsinoe, is also (I believe) a Greek  woman.  In any case, I picked up this book because of professional and  pedagogical interest in the topic, and by and large, I have to say that I  enjoyed reading it.  Some things about this book are really excellent:  the  description of the material conditions of the middle ages, the pilgrimage  descriptions themselves (some of which, esp. the complaints about the  immorality of fellow travelers, are taken from Fabri's own comments), and  the interactions with Muslims.  However, the sort of achingly romantic tone  that the character Fabri takes when speaking of his spiritual bride,  Katherine, is out of place.  While there was a mystical quality to late  medieval piety that we might today term &quot;romantic&quot; (in the wake  of the 19th century), the statements that the character Fabri makes about  wanting to have sex with his spiritual bride, Catherine, or admiring her  breasts, etc., are out of place--these would have bordered on heresy in the  middle ages, which used these concepts at most in a highly figurative way.  Holman seems to confuse the figurative chivalric &quot;romantic&quot;  qualities of the late middle Ages with an overstated nineteenth century  romanticism that would have been foreign to the period itself.  Another  issue that bothered me:  Fabri's continual reference to how dirty  everything was, which I think is overstated.  Everything in the MA was  probably indeed dirty and disgusting--but it was that way because it didn't  bother people to theextent that it appears to bother Fabri.  To sum up:  the author uses a lot of authentic detail taken from Fabri's own words, but  she misinterprets significant aspects of it.  For the historian, the fact  that she tells an exciting story does not entirely mitigate this problem.	2000-02-07
US	51075980	R20QO9YR4184MH	0385260326	287129497	The Trial of Socrates	Books	5	13	18	N	N	This is an important book	I think that it is very hard for anyone who is informed about Platonic  philosophy to accept this argument completely at face value.  Nonetheless,  it is an excellent book because it presents us with a new perspective on  that old treasure of Western Civ and intro to philosophy classes, Plato's  presentation of the death of Socrates.  Stone argues that Athens was  justified in its execution of Socrates because Socrates demonstrated  himself in these texts to be an opponent of Athenian democracy and values;  this is in contrast to the interpretation that Socrates was such a defender  of democracy that he was willing to obey it even when it appeared to deal  unjustly with him.  Discussing this thesis in my intro to Western Civ  classes offers my students a valuable entry into a fundamental task of  historical scholarship:  the comparison of a primary text or source to  interpretations that are given to that text or source.  In fact, most of my  students agree with Stone (without having read him) that Socrates is an  egotistical pain in the a** and most of them are able to find evidence in  the text for Stone's arguments (particularly Socrates' remarks on horses  and horse trainers).  Of course, there is also evidence (particularly  Socrates' representation of the Laws of Athens) for the opposing thesis.   Consequently, when I present Stone's argument in class, there is never  silence, but a great debate typically breaks out--which is what I want to  happen in my classes.  A text never admits of only one interpretation, and  the ideas presented in this book help students to see that.  Although the  ideas of the book clearly contradict some of the central scholarship on the  primary text, most readers won't be interested in going that far anyway.   This books revives an old text and makes it interesting and controversial;  consequently I recommended it despite its somewhat obvious exaggeration of  some of its points.	2000-02-06

But Texier's own unselfawareness, her own unwillingness to really be  self critical beyond a few scattered moments, her inability to get beyond  the sarcastic and repeated question, &quot;what did I do to you,&quot;  point up the difference between life and art.  Texier confuses sex and  love, and thinks that she can bind this man to her continually, even though  he explains that he doesn't love her anymore, by passionate and wild sex,  and then asks in a condescending and obviously insincere way, &quot;so what  did I do wrong?&quot;  This memoir demonstrates the narcissistic  self-obsession that probably caused the relationship to collapse in the  first place.  It gets two stars because it generates a sort of voyeuristic  sex based need to keep on reading, almost against one's will.	2000-01-29

I am not a dope, and I have a PhD in history--but I honestly couldn't follow  this book.  One problem, as other readers have noted, is the bizarre  writing style.  If you're trying to write something about the history of  math for non mathematicians, please write in simple language--don't clog up  your writing with metaphors about western literature.  It's distracting,  and kept me thinking about literature when the reason I had for reading the  book was to find out something about mathematics.  Also, you have to have  more than a basic understanding of how mathematics works in order to  understand this book.  Example:  the author writes that a particular Indian  philosopher should just have known that the statement 0/0=0 is false.  Why?   I remember from algebra that division by zero is impossible, but I don't  remember why.  The author assumes too much about the general math knowledge  of the educated reading public.  And the chapter on cuneiform addition is  impenetrable.  I'll look to a history of mathematics textbook next--this  may be something for people who already know everything the author wants to  say and just want it expressed in a poetic fashion, but it's not a good  introduction to the subject.	2000-01-28

Based on the recommendation of the book in &quot;what we're reading&quot; on this site, I had it on the pile of books &quot;to read sometime&quot; by my nightstand when Oprah chose it (and being a big  Oprah fan, I immediately read it).  One positive thing is that the heroine,  Julie, is extremely likeable.  However, there were plot elements that  didn't make sense to me (if she is such a hard, tough, nononsense person,  then how does she make the silly mistake that seems to trigger a chain of  ruin in her and her husband's lives?) and the litany of one disaster after  another was a little hard to take. Another plus was the detail in which  farm work is described (very realistic if you've ever seen a hog butchered,  by the way, or cleaned a turkey yourself).  However, the only character  that seemed to have any subtlety was the the heroine.  Her husband,  mother-in-law, and sisters are all flat characters that seem to have only  one major character trait (negative) a piece.  I didn't see what the point  of the marital infidently scene was, since it doesn't contribute additional  information to the characterization of the husband or the heroine and it  doesn't seem to play any role in the plot (which is pretty one-toned, if  you asked me).  The very limited character development in this book  &quot;didn't bring me anything but down,&quot; sadly:  Julie is a hard  worker when we meet her and that doesn't change, but every time she has a  moment of happiness, it's crushed.  Nonetheless, these experiences don't  seem to have any effect on her.<br />In short, the book is OK and I did read  it all the way to the end, but I'm not sure it really rated the bestseller  status that Oprah's selection is sure to give it.  I'll have to read  Oprah's website and find out why she selected it.	2000-01-19

As she noted repeatedly, none of McGough's  legal contacts had much interest in her story, and Malcolm did not succeed  in making me care, either about McGough or the issues at hand--an ironic  case of hoist on your own petard.	2000-01-17

Her point in the first part is that insofar as  recovered memory syndrome, ritual satanic abuse, and multiple personality  disorder are taken seriously, they apparently do little to help people  recover from their unhappy states, and insofar as the claims of people  suffering from these disorders are provably false in an objective sense,  they discredit the professionals who diagnose them and the individuals who  are diagnosed with them.  Her more important point ( in my opinion) in the  second part is that insofar as these phenomena have been discredited in the  wider public, they lead to a distraction from or discrediting of related  issues (sexual and other kinds of abuse of children and women, and more  importantly, the circumstances of poor people, who are more likely to  suffer certain sorts of abuse). Most likely no one will be able to settle  many of the disputes over the accuracy of repressed childhood memories, but  she points to an important problem--these particular trends in  psychotherapy distract us from important social problems and yet offer no  solution to them.<br />On a related theme:  I visited a therapist in 1996 to  be treated for depression--a therapist that my mother found for me--who  insisted that I must have repressed memories and that this could be the  only source of my longterm, episodal depression (she ignored my culture  shock from a transcontinental move, my below-poverty-line income, the end  of a serious long term relationship, my unfinished dissertation, and a  troubled relationship with an alcoholic parent).  When I pointed out to her  that I have almost continuous memories of my life after the age of 5 (my  friends are continually astounded that I can tell them what we ate at a  restaurant meal in college) and that I felt it unlikely that I had  repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse, she told me that I was in  denial and that until I recognized the importance of recovering these  memories, I would continue to suffer from episodic depression.  When I  repeated that I wanted therapy for my current problems, she accused me of  being resistant to therapy and promptly volunteered to schedule me for  three sessions a week to get me over this problem.  I thanked her for her  time and told her that I would no longer be requiring her services; when  she immediately presented me with a bill (which she assumed my parents  would pay) for $200 for her services, I pointed out to her that my father  was unemployed at the time and I would have to pay the bill myself.  Since  she already knew about my income problems, this actively reduced her  interest in treating me!<br />My point is this: if you go to a therapist with  an open mind to asking for help in resolving problems and he or she tells  you something that seems ridiculous, it probably is:  therapists, despite  their training and potential gift for insight, have no special intellectual  powers--merely more degrees.	2000-01-17

Huntford's biography points  out why Scott died on this trip:  because he let his ignorance cloud his  judgment and shut out information from people who could have helped him.   It's really annoying that people still go on glorifying Scott--who didn't  make it home and caused the deaths of others who accompanied him.	2000-01-17

What I  enjoyed was hearing the story of people who fall in love, not motivated by  their hormones or outward appearances, but by genuing respect for each  other.

Many &quot;beginners&quot; are disturbed by the  idea that kavannah could come from what seems to be mindless mumbling of  syllables. Moreover, most orthodox communities come across as incredibly  closed when you visit them either as a woman, a BT, or a convert. Another  point:  Klinghoffer's characterization of conservative communities in the  US as unconcerned about observance is overstated. The conservative  community that I spent the most time in had a very observant temple  leadership, ANY convert spent two years in instruction, (and the members of  the bet din were ALL observant of the commandments) and all bar/bat  Mitzvahs had spent something like 8 years in Hebrew school:  they could  understand the Torah reading AND ask directions to the bus stop.  Klinghoffer presents Judaism as an either/or dilemma:  either you're  Orthodox or you're just screwing around--there is no meaningful kind of  Judaism outside of the orthodox community. I think, in contrast, that your  experience of Judaism is simply much more related to which congregation you  come in contact with.  Because Judaism in the U.S. is not a religious body  with a central authority that makes pronouncements about how community life  will be conducted,every congregation is different; within the different  ideological directions, there is a tremendous variation in practice, and in  the end, observance of ritual is the most visceral level on which  individuals can participate in Judaism.  To Klinghoffer's credit, he points  out something important about Reform in the U.S.:  although the Reform  movement has a specific ideology that tends to be anti-ritual in character,  that ideology is, at least in theory, predicated on having enough  information about traditional Judaism to be able to decide which rituals  are meaningful.  At present, however, most Reform congregations consist of  people who know little or nothing about Judaism and don't really want  to--so they're not making an informed judgement--and Reform rabbis, in my  experience, do little to make the halacha comprehensible or attractive to  their congregations (if out of fear or lack of conviction, I am uncertain).  But his criticism of Reform based on Reform summer camps is trivial and  ultimately irrelevant--what about homosexual encounters in the yeshiva,  which are apparently fairly common?  For every trivial piece of evidence he  comes up with to condemn the Reform community, I could come up with a  parallel in the orthodox community. I wonder if his experience of Judaism  has any relationship to WHERE he experienced it (on both coasts, where the  majority of Jews live).  Judaism (reform and conservative) in parts of the  country where Jews do not constitute a significant minority is much more  like the Judaism Klinghoffer seems to want than most of the orthodox  communities I have visited in the U.S. and abroad, because there is no way  to be Jewish outside of the religious community.  When there is no cultural  secular Judaism present, Jewish identification takes place only in the  religious sphere (I realize this conclusion supports his contentions that  secular Judaism is meaningless).	1999-12-12

Kramer underlines  the point that there is really no standard of &quot;emotional health&quot;  or anything like it that can really determine whether a relationship is  worth continuing or not, and that is a message the reading public needs to  hear.

What's good  about that is that she might motivate someone to read Heschel.  The rest of  the book is not especially revealing--we never really get into any of the  emotional transformations the author claimed were at work.  Finally, as  another reviewer noted, she doesn't really get religion.  As a Jew living  among Christians in a very Christian part of the country (I am one of six  Jews in the university town where I teach and live) I also get tired of the  constant bombardment of information about Jesus, but Orsborn seems to take  it personally.  She has no understanding of how Christianity shapes the  culture of Americans, just as she has no historical understanding of the  ways in which Judaism shaped Jewish culture.  A very disappointing book--I  am really surprised that someone with this few intellectual gifts could  succeed in getting a degree from Vanderbilt.

YES, graduate school is THAT bad, and  now that I myself have to advise students who are thinking in some abstract  and idealistic way of graduate school, I am glad to see that there is some  literature that points out what an awful experience it is.  Because the  fact is, many graduate programs in the humanities have attrition rates well  over 70% for the PhD and people come out of those programs bitter and dried  up.

To say that Saffian is &quot;spoiled&quot; or  &quot;ungrateful&quot; here is to miss the point:  the book is a  description of her personal journey and feelings about that journey.  Why  insist that there is a one &quot;right&quot; way to react to this  experience?  Some people would react differently were they in the same  situation, but the point of a personal memoir is that they're not in that  situation:  only the experiencing subject can write down his perception of  the situation.  The world is filled with all kinds of people who have  different reactions to different situations, which is what makes life  interesting.<br />That said:  another thing that Saffian provides her audience  with is a sensitive account of how therapy and self-discovery can work,  which provides the important additional information that therapy is not  only about finding out the truth (say, about how one has been damaged), it  is about recognizing difficult truths about yourself.  Saffian found out  that for various reasons, she felt the need to control every situation (a  feature of her personality that contributed to her hesitation to meet her  birth family), a trait that had got her ahead in life but that also was  interfering with aspects of her happiness.  She needed to work on herself  in order to make herself able to meet her birth parents.  That is the true  success story here and the fact that finally shows that she isn't spoiled  and ungrateful; in the process of these changes, she learned about herself  and tried to improve herself.<br />This book is written very much in a  twentysomething conventional style, which is a matter of taste; some people  don't care for it, but I like it very much.	1999-12-04

In its spareness of language it is  quite similar to Haruf's recent _Plainsong_, but of course in other  respects they are very different books.  I really appreciated the author's  attempt to talk about moral issues in South African politics without  explicitly moralizing: in the daughter's response to the violence against  her one sees the variety of options that confront the powerless on BOTH  sides of the problem.  The prose is elegant, as is the narrative. The  subtle, never over-writen ironies of the book (a &quot;communications&quot;  professor who is such a lousy communicator, the wronged oppressed people  who wrong others, for example) add to its elegance. I also appreciated that  Coetzee did not attempt to make his protagonist attractive to us:  in his  faults and virtues he seems a very believable person.	1999-11-30

What a waste of time.  These characters are so flat and unbelievable--esp. the tyrannical father.  I mean, I know that  kids often perceive their parents in this way, but are parents really like  this?  I don't think so.  Moreover, I felt like the role of the Congo in  this story was a gimmick--this story could just as well have been told in  an American setting, which Kingsolver could have done more believably,  because she apparently needs a bibliography to prove to her readers that  she knows something about the Congo. It was hard to like or sympathize with  the characters or believe in what they were going through.	1999-11-14

I find it telling that she admits she doesn't speak any of the languages of the people she is writing about.  The  translations are abominably awkward, even if a skilled ear can sort of hear  the original German behind them.  She missed many of the subtleties of  German culture, moreover, she completely ignored the Western side of the  East German question and comes out with a sort of &quot;poor East Germany,  poor East Germans&quot; approach that is less than useful in the current  context.  If you want to understand Germany, then you have to live there.   Her equation and comparison of the Communist regimes in S. American and E.  Europe is poorly chosen and poorly conducted, it's as if she thought all  Communist regimes were more or less comparable.  Much better books on this  topic by Timothy Garton Ash, esp. &quot;The File&quot;.  Can't believe she  got a MacArthur Foundation grant to write this.	1999-11-14

Scarpetta's.  Is it possible she's changed editors?  That would explain this phenomenon, as  well as the (strange) new books w/o Scarpetta as a hero, all of which are  in desperate need of editing.

If the point is  to show that political conservatives (Scarpetta) can accept and lesbians,  even though lesbians are inherently screwy and constitute a serious  security risk, well, I am still not convinced.	1999-11-07

And the descriptive level he achieves is remarkable:  from  describing the nausea of pregnancy to the feelings of eightyearold boys.  This may have been the best book I read this year.	1999-11-05
