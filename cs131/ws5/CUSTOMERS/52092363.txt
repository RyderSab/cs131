Practicing the Presence of God presents the way Brother Lawrence recommends that we stay in touch with God on a daily basis.  It is practical, simple, and, above all, it works.  It is not too dissimilar to  the concept behind In His Steps (I think that's the title) where one asks  at every step, &quot;What would Christ do?&quot;  In this case one, in all  of one's daily activities (washing the dishes, studying, anything), puts  oneself into God's presence (as St. John of the Christ says, it  CAN be by  imagination, or in reality, or whatever works for you), one dedicates every  action to God, and one lets the awareness of God's presence guide every  decision and movement throughout the day.  Thus life itself becomes prayer,  and every move one makes is a sacrament.  I know, from experience, that  this works, and that this is a very powerful method of bringing God's  presence into one's daily activities.  What starts by imagination quickly  evolves into reality, and this provides both guidance and protection  throughout the day.  It can also be VERY demanding - God is not just a  presence on Sunday morning, or at our meditation sessions - he is actively  carried with us throughout the day, so demands are exacted from us  concerning our conduct and behavior that are on a very high level.  This is  NOT thoughtless living!  It can be heroism of the highest level.  But it  can also be one of the most effective methods of making fast progress in  the spiritual life.  One should commune with God whenever possible - in  prayer or meditation - and than take this practice with one in one's daily  activities, so one draws upon those inner resources that are awakened  through prayer.	1998-12-18

The Heart Aroused is a book about the state of the soul in the corporate workplace, written by an English poet.  If you've ever wondered &quot;Am I the only one who is miserable here?&quot; or &quot;Do others feel they  can't speak the truth?&quot; or &quot;Are others being smothered here as  well?&quot;, you will love this book.  Yes - others feel these things.   This book says what no one will articulate: it IS hard to speak the truth  (or gain one's own voice) in the corporate workplace, it IS hard to  maintain one's integrity and BE oneself, it IS hard to be healthy and happy  in this environment.  But Whyte does not advocate heading for the hills -  he feels the corporate workplace can be transformed (with effort) by more  awareness on the part of both management and workers.  He DOES see the good  points of corporations (as efficiency).  He, himself, goes into  corporations giving workshops on this subject.  He ends by mentioning that  we spend most of our waking hours at work, so it is a matter of our health,  on every level, how we are able to function, what kind of conditions  surround us, and what the goals of the corporation are.  As a work of  beauty, as a book that reinforces what so many people feel, and as  something that provokes thought, I highly recommend this book.	1998-12-18
US	52092363	R1JRH3PSD8M1YT	8423309835	980205880	1984 (Spanish Language Edition)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	I loved this book!	I highly recommend 1984, by George Orwell, in any edition or translation you choose, because I feel he was so very prophetic about the times in which we live.  This book does not describe what COULD happen - it  describes what HAS happened, at least, in some cases and to a certain  percentage of the public.  The information elite today, increasingly, is  using cameras to monitor people - including, with those they target - in  ALL areas of their lives.  Likewise, people are alienated and rendered  voiceless by this faceless elite who churns out lies and brainwashing (in  my opinion) to keep them distracted and neutered.  Authors names ARE being  changed, gifts ARE stolen, composite characters ARE created, triple speak  IS practiced, coverups ARE participated in.  I know these things are true  because I have seen and experienced them, as I am sure we all have, on a  sliding scale.  Likewise, society is dividing, more and more, into classes  - those with insider information and privileges, and the masses who have  &quot;freedom&quot; but cannot use it, and live like animals.  I see this  everyday.  The &quot;threat&quot; is the hero of 1984, who dares to FEEL,  speak the truth, try to escape conditioning.  The villain is the machinery  of the system, both in 1984 and today.  A very good book on this subject  (nonfiction) is Friendly Fascism by Betram Gross - written ten years ago,  and, in my opinion, an understatement of what is occurring, but nonetheless  brilliant and illuminating.	1998-12-17

The Queen of America Goes to Washington City is a series of essays said to be on sex and citizenship.  In my opinion, they are more on sex and Ms. Berlant, because she seems to be viewing her subject matter through  over-sexualized - and, in my view, filthy -lenses.  (One can also see  Critical Inquiry for this, which she co-edits).  She seems to be  representing a school of &quot;English&quot; (cultural criticism) which  veils what it is doing behind heavy and almost impenetrable jargon, which  purports to be objective, but is, in fact, both violating, exploiting and  insulting their subject matter, and which drones on endlessly about trivia  while one wonders what has happened to the state of &quot;English&quot; in  the academy.  I feel it is very unfortunate that some in academia, politics  and the arts write about, and use, this kind of nonsense (or worse), and  even more unfortunate that publishers are willing to dump it on an  unsuspecting public.  Don't waste your time with this book!  Seek out  authors with more integrity, more intelligence and more honesty (they  exist), and, above all, demand that publishers of nonfiction raise their  standards on every level.	1998-12-17

I have read all of Ms. Sinetar's books, including this one, and do not recommend them, or this, because, in my opinion, they are exploitative, and because she has set herself up as a spokesperson for the spiritual life,  while actually making a fortune.  Can a corporate view purport to speak for  spirituality?  Or a high-tech, watch tapes of others mentality?  We live in  an age where the information elite feels NO compunction about how they  gather information or what they do with it.  Spirituality, if it is real,  does not and cannot include this. Real spirituality (a) respects others (b)  asks permission to use source material and acknowledges it (c) does not  seek to profit at others' expense.  Am I saying this is the case with this  book?  You can form your own opinion.  Choose your spiritual writers  carefully (as Thomas Keating or Romano Guardini) and don't waste your time  reading this.	1998-12-17

The Way of Perfection is one of St. Teresa of Avila's great books, in which she discusses the nature of the path to God (perfecting oneself) and offers advice and spiritual insights about this.  As with all of her  writings, this book is remarkable because St. Teresa was a mystic who had  close and ongoing communion with God on a level few ever reach, that is  rare.  She was also charming, funny, and delightful - so reading her is a  joy.  Highly recommended.	1998-12-08

This book was written as a book of spiritual guidance, and an unconventional book, in that it writes about &quot;saints&quot;, or those who have surrendered to God's will, yet outwardly do not appear to be  remarkable, or seem to fall into the category of &quot;very famous&quot;  spiritual people.  He discusses things like: the traps and dangers the  world imposes on such people, the fact that they are often abused and spied  on diligently (and unjustly), their apparent &quot;childishness&quot;, the  face that they present to the world (often seen as laughing stocks or  incompetents), versus the truth of God's workings in their lives, the  nature of the world - that those who outwardly appear to be &quot;great  princes&quot; are presenting a false face to the world, that Satan enlists  regiments of scoundrels for these visible positions who wage war  relentlessly against those who love God, and, in fact, that behind all this  falsification stands the whole battle of human history.  And, of course,  that in the end the last shall be first, and God's servants shall triumph.   While not in the league of some of the greatest saints' writings, it still  has invaluable insights to offer, and so I recommend this book.	1998-12-08

Sri Chinmoy is a modern spiritual master (an enlightened being) who lives in Queens, New York and has written prolifically on the spiritual life.  Meditation is his most famous book on how to meditate.  In it he gives the  steps, elaborates on all of these, and answers questions about the process  of meditation.  What is amazing - and unique - about Sri Chinmoy's books is  his highly advanced level of consciousness, the intensity and clarity with  which he addresses spiritual matters, and the fact that he breaks new  ground.  He discusses - and gives answers to - spiritual matters not  discussed by others.  He is VERY DETAILED about the minutiae of  spirituality, and has definite ideas as to the FORM it should take.  In  person, he is an amazing person, filled with POWERFUL spiritual energy,  seemingly endless stamina, and overflowing creativity.  He radiates purity  and strength.  His viewpoint is unique - he does not come out of the  Christian tradition (although he embraces the divinity of Christ), but the  Eastern tradition, so his style is quite different from a Western one.  I  recommend this book, and his books, for exposure to the spirituality he  offers, and for those who feel personally called to follow his path.  In  addition, the meditation he offers is sound.  It is heart-centered, and can  be applied to any tradition in which one feels comfortable.	1998-12-01

Interior Castle, by St. Teresa of Avila, is one of the saint's writings that is filled with spiritual insight, charm, and breathtaking closeness to God.  Her castle is the God within, and there are outward mansions that  must be penetrated to get to this inner treasure.  Each mansion is a  deepening of one's knowledge of God, and a step further away from one's  capture by externality and the world.  She describes these inward steps,  and leads one onward to union with God (or God carries one onward - at  first it is our efforts, than it is God's).  Beautiful and illuminating.	1998-12-01

The I Ching, or Book of Changes, is a Chinese book of wisdom which can be used (supposedly) to divine what one's actions SHOULD be in a given situation, by ascertaining the seeds of future events.  In their view (and  that of all major faiths) the &quot;play&quot; of life - action, motion,  speech, externality - is played out on a backdrop of the unchanging, the  stable, or the divine.  This core or foundation behind what we normally  think of as our existence is, in fact, the Real.  The other is transitory,  (&quot;maya&quot;), always moving, changing (decay, growth, fruition,  success, failure, etc.)  To be &quot;successful&quot; it must be rooted in  and grounded in the unchanging.  It must also be virtuous and wise.  The  authors of this book supposedly fasted and prayed and purified their  natures until they could discern the patterns of this movement on top of  Reality.  By taking action early (holding back, moving forward, etc.) one  can shape the seeds of these changes, work with &quot;maya&quot;, and  basically perform right action.  The book can be used as a tool for  prophecy, but is also useful just to read for the wisdom contained therein.	1998-12-01

Anam Cara, (&quot;Soul Friend&quot;), by John O'Donohue is a beautiful book, weaving Celtic spirituality and tradition into an Irish poet's musings on life.  What I loved about this book was its beauty.  Written to  discuss Celtic spirituality, it actually (in my view) showcases O'Donohue's  dazzling, moving and intimate gift of poetry.  I found his imagery and  poems breathtaking - so much so, that I saved most of them.  He is deeply  lyrical, old fashioned, close to the land, and, again, strikingly  beautiful.	1998-12-01

Sri Aurobindo was one of this century's enlightened beings, and his writings are a treasure left to us by him.  In Lights on Yoga, he speaks of union with God, what is necessary to attain this, and its relation to world  (cosmic) events.  He was a seer - he saw the large (not small) picture -  and his spiritual writings mirror this.  He talks of aligning oneself with  the &quot;divine force&quot; - God's will in Christian terms, Tao in  Taoism, the divine energy of the universe - and the direction it is moving  in. I recommend all of his books.	1998-12-01

Thoughts in Solitude, by Thomas Merton, is a beautiful little book with musings and insights which come out of his life as a contemplative monk.  One thing I love about Merton - and this book - is that it breathes  solitude - slow, reflective, thoughtful, quiet solitude.  Merton knows what  we ALL should know - that Reality can only be ascertained from a silence  and stillness of being.  This Reality - the reality of God and of one's  Self - is the groundwork for proper action or speech in the world.  Far  from fleeing one's duties, one only discovers them properly if one has  incorporated this into one's life.  He speaks of the things that are most  useful precisely because they are useless to man, the silence that  penetrates the very bones of a monk, the discovery of Self and of God by  leaving self and over-externality.  One finds one's Self by losing one's  self, one speaks with meaning by being silent, one finds God by renouncing  gods.  The spiritual life IS a contradiction from a worldly standpoint.  He  who is last shall be first, he who is most mature shall become like a  child, he who has nothing shall have everything.  The discovery of God and  one's Self is a stripping away - not an accumulation, a receptivity, not an  overwhelming.  Highly recommended.	1998-12-01

God Is is a compilation of writings from Sri Chinmoy's vast and prolific body of works, chosen by his advanced students, and put out in one volume.  It is a good introduction to his thought, and is divided by subject.  His  writings, as always, are clear, intense, highly evolved and unique.  He is  a powerful spiritual master, and the book expresses this.  Although not  Christian, it is filled with insights, wisdom and clarity on the spiritual  life well worth reading, whether or not one fully subscribes to his  philosophy or path.  Highly recommended.	1998-12-01

The Cancer Prevention Diet, by Michio Kushi, outlines the causes and cures for cancer, according to a macrobiotic philosophy.  This philosophy, posited on yin-yang (as male-female) is about excess, imbalance (sickness)  and balance (health) and how to bring this about in our lives and our  diets.  It is a wonderful book - very thorough on background, filled with  testimonies from cancer survivors, outlining the different types of  cancers, and detailing information on menus, cooking, healing tactics, etc.   Even if one does not fully embrace the macrobiotic philosophy, I think  this is a wonderful book, and gives sound advice on healthy eating and lots  of other things associated with cancer.  I highly recommend this book as a  reference book for health, and a book of hope.	1998-12-01

New Seeds of Contemplation is a book ON contemplation.  It is a wonderful book, and shows Merton at the height of his &quot;powers&quot; (his relationship with God).  It breathes the peace and slowness of the  contemplative life, and discusses spiritual problems, thorny issues,  questions that come up, and issues of justice and procedure.  Merton is a  master at tackling questions probably everyone has wondered about, but not  known the answer to, skilled as he was in both prayer AND spiritual  direction.  It is also a beautiful book, with the monk's simplicity of  perspective on being and doing, similar to Brother Lawrence's  &quot;Practicing the Presence of God&quot;.  &quot;Work done under pressure  cannot be dedicated to God, because God does not will such work.&quot;   &quot;If you have to live in a city and work among machines and noise, be  glad that you at least have a spark of peace in your soul and know solitude  is the source of peace and joy - many people do not even know that  anymore.&quot; (I am paraphrasing).  He was a contemporary monk in a modern  world faced with the modern world's problems, but commenting on these from  a place apart - his monastery, so his voice was at once very necessary, and  irreplaceable.  Highly recommended.	1998-11-13

The End of the Modern World, by Romano Guardini, is a short masterpiece on the problems of the age in which we now live - and which is now drawing to a close.  Modern man is faced for the first time in his history with  &quot;mass&quot; man. This &quot;mass&quot; affects everything - human  dignity, right relationship with God, individuality, freedom, quality of  life.  The very nature of man can be called into question, with shattering  consequences for our faith and our &quot;home&quot; in the universe.   Guardini understood very well the &quot;warehousing&quot; concept of human  life, where amongst crowds of men, the human person can lose significance,  spiritual autonomy, and his bearings, feeling both crushed by these masses,  and at the same time unable to escape them.  He also understood the reality  and trends toward totalitarianism, having resisted, been silenced by, and  gone into hiding to escape the Nazis, himself.  In my opinion, Guardini's  writings (prophetic as they were) on the times in which we live are his  most brilliant.  He is a voice of God crying out in a world that is  escalating ever more surely to annihilation of all that the human person  has always considered fundamental to human life - dignity, right   relationship with God, freedom.  His other books which touch on this  subject, The World and the Person, The Virtues, Power and Responsibility,  and Letters from Lake Como, are also indispensable reading for facing and  grappling with the problems of The End of the Modern World.  I highly  recommend Romano Guardini.	1998-11-13

The Path to No-Self, by Bernadette Roberts, is truly cutting edge and breaks new ground.  The author, of whom we are told very little, has obviously known God, and - unlike the testimonies of many saints who  describe the approach to enlightenment and than enlightenment itself, takes  that as only the FIRST goal on the path.  She speaks of the life AFTER  enlightenment, and describes states of being I have not encountered in any  other spiritual literature.  Where Teresa of Avila ends (in writing) she  begins - a daring concept indeed.  I DO NOT THINK she is mentally ill.   What she describes, I feel, is sound.  But it must be remembered (a) that  all paths are unique and (b) that the higher levels of communion with God,  while on the earth, are NOT easy - in fact, they can be the opposite, in  every sense of the word.  (CAN be...aren't necessarily so).  Ms. Roberts  speaks masterfully of the collision of two strong opposing forces - the  overwhelming desire to have an outlet for this tremendous energy and power  of God one is carrying, to share, convert, be received, understood, to  create - and the world's reception to this - rejection, non understanding,  persecution, refusal to give outlets, smothering.  How can one AT ONCE be a  vehicle for what is so powerful and so strong that it DEMANDS expression,  while the world refuses to accept this?  This, Ms. Roberts explains, is no  accident.  (ONE way to view this).  It is God's way of mortifying, refining  and purifying the person of all last vestiges of self (ambition, concern  with obvious results, etc.) until the person is so empty that it is GOD and  no longer the person who operates.  (Even to the point of losing awareness  of the enlightened Self within).  Given the magnitude of the suffering  these two collisions cause, this is, according to her, what happens.   Likewise, she masterfully describes &quot;layers of God&quot; - being able,  when in prayer, to sink through more and more &quot;doors&quot; (layers) to  go ever deeper within, to drop, progressively more of the outer, excited  self, and experience God at ever more deep levels.  It is like passing  through trap doors, or breaking through to new levels of consciousness.   These are two examples of how she is at once courageous, daring, bold,  risky, and - I feel - accurate.	1998-11-11

This book, by Romano Guardini, takes the Lord's prayer and analyzes it line by line, with Guardini, in his profound, deep and masterful manner explaining the true nature and meaning of this prayer, and evoking more  respect, insight into its depth, and understanding of its significance.  A  reading of any of Guardini's books is in itself a spiritual experience, for  he was a man of God and a very powerful beacon of spiritual energy and  strength.  He was also a master of words, and this prayer is filled with  words that symbolize, on a deep deep level, the nature and workings of God  in our lives.  As with all of Guardini's writings, I highly recommend this  - he is one writer one should not be without.	1998-11-11

The Upanishads, translated by Juan Mascaro, is a beautiful translation, which, like Mascaro's translation of The Bhagavid Gita, breathes simplicity and purity throughout.  The Upanishads are maxims on the spiritual life,  and are poetry, scripture, guidance all in one.  &quot;The truth is hidden  by a circle of gold.  Unveil the truth, oh God of light, that I might  see!&quot;  &quot;It is not for the love of the husband that the husband is  dear, but for the soul that is in the husband.&quot;  &quot;Behold, all  that lives and walks on earth. Leaving the transient, take refuge in the  eternal,  set not your heart on another's possession.  Working thus, a man  can wish for a life of one hundred years. Only actions done in God, bind  not the heart of man.&quot; (I paraphrase).

Juan Mascaro's translation of the famous Bhagavid Gita, the song of our Lord, is truly beautiful, and breathes purity, simplicity, spirituality, and  insight throughout.  This is one of the classic scriptures of  Hinduism, along with the Upanishads and the Ramayana....and tells the tale  - against a backdrop of &quot;earthly battle&quot; - of the soul's battle  to find God, and to manifest His will on this earth.  It is exceptionally  clear, and explains the nature of the human being, HOW one should live  one's life (work, food, thoughts, associations, etc.), the nature of  meditation, how to become enlightened, the nature of God, and what  constitutes a holy man. I want to quote some of the beauty of the phrases,  but without the book immediately in front of me, fear I will misquote.  But  it is a book of poetry, an explanation of the right attitude to work,  action, thoughts, enlightened men, God, oneself, where the vehicle of the  battle is just that - a vehicle used to convey these ancient, and in the  East very well understood, and timeless truths.	1998-11-10

St. John of the Cross is one of the most famous mystics in the Catholic Church, as well as the world.  He was a Carmelite priest, and lived - and suffered - in 16th century Spain, along with the equally famous Teresa of Avila (the two had great admiration for each other). He left behind a body of work that is classic in mystical literature - maxims on the spiritual life, instructions as to preparation, purification and ascent to God (The Ascent of Mount Carmel), the perils and trials of the spiritual life (The Dark Night of the Soul), and fruition and union with God (The Living Flame of Love and The Spiritual Canticle).  His depth of thought, the profundity of his knowledge of God, and the beauty of his poetic writings rank him as a master in the mystical life.  He uses, at times, difficult and verbose descriptions (certainly deep), which should not frighten off someone willing to read his writings.  One must appreciate the fact that each saint has their own language on these matters, and that it is filtered through their personality, so while his &quot;stages&quot; may not perfectly match Teresa of Avila's (or any other saint's), the truth in the background is what counts, and is edifying, inspiring and illuminating.  He is, today, a master teacher and model in spiritual matters, which go from leading an upright life, to purification (by God) of one's life, to trials (the dark night) meant to purify us, strengthen our faith and instruct us, to fruition and union with God, always stating that it is God's will as to His dealings with souls, so no two people can expect exactly the same paths, experiences or, even, necessarily, outcomes.  Concerning this, he gives advice, warning, and illumination as to temptations, dangers, and expectations.  I recommend his writings for their holiness, their helpfulness, and their sheer beauty, and counsel potential readers not to be frightened off by their &quot;apparent&quot; obtuseness.	1998-11-07

Written at the command of her superiors, it is the autobiography of St. Teresa of Avila, a Spanish Carmelite nun, mystic, and  religious reformer, in an age where women, mysticism, and political  activism were considered bold and rare.  I found it, at first, to be a  difficult book - difficult because of its intensity, and difficult because  of the level on which it is written - it comes out of the highest levels of  communion and friendship with God.  I could only read it in increments (it  was too overwhelming).  Later, I was able to reread it freely, because I  had assimilated her language (a spiritual one) and point of view, and was  familiar with it.  Its greatness lies in her enthusiastic, attractive  personality, her original and very holy spiritual insights, her adventurous  path in her relationship with God, and the clear and amazing articulation  of very high levels of prayer and action stemming from constant communion  with God.  Mysticism is very hard to articulate - THIS is why this book is  great.  It DOES articulate it.  I think, of all her writings, it is the  most amazing, clearest, and most insightful.  Her nougats of wisdom on the  spiritual life and life in the world have stayed with me, and I often think  back to her - or to her preface - for both guidance and sustenance.  It is  not without cause that she was declared a doctor of the Catholic Church,  and is looked upon as a very great saint in the Church.  As she says,  &quot;Let nothing distress you, Let nothing disturb you, All things pass  but God, Who alone is all.  Patience will get thee, All that thou hast  striven for.  Cleave to God, and naught else will fail thee, for God alone  is all.&quot;	1998-11-06

Friendly Fascism, by Bertram Gross, is an excellent, gripping, knowledgeable and illuminating book by a man who served as an insider in the system (the White House) and evolved to the point that he felt the  system itself was the problem, and both needed exposing (as to its anatomy  and tactics, never discussed publically in the mass media or in our  educational institutions) and its need for change.  His book was a warning  as to the seeds of a new brand of fascism he clearly saw evolving in this  country (written during the Reagan administration), which was also warned  against, prophetically, in Romano Guardini's early books, The End of the  Modern World, The World and the Person, Power and Responsibility, Letters  from Lake Como, and The Virtues (some of which are still out of print).  He  brilliantly analyzes the hierarchy of the system, where real power lies,  how it is maintained, the role of the public in all this, perhaps - most  importantly - the issue of wealth and control of information.  When I read  this book I felt great joy - because he succeeded in getting it into print  and because what he had to say was so desperately needed.  I even feel this  more strongly now - my only complaint is that what he said was beginning  was, I feel, understated - it has evolved and progressed farther than that  and many of his warnings (as surveillance) are now &quot;accepted&quot;  ways of conducting high-level business, are, in fact, the foundation of it  in many ways.  Whole industries (as mass media) are becoming built upon  this, hidden behind Gross's brilliant explanation of &quot;triple  speak&quot; (truth, only whispered at elite gatherings, myth, and jargon -  the latter two fed to the public to confuse and distract.)  It is an  exciting, brilliant and very necessary book, right on the mark, and highly  recommended.	1998-10-30

Letters from Lake Como is a short book containing musings by Romano Guardini on technology, the evolution from a pre-technological world to our modern age, and, ultimately, the impact, or spirituality, in all of this.   Guardini, a product of pre-technological Italy and post-technological  Germany, and a thinker who could draw together science, art, philosophy,  and theology (with great ease) shows the reader the profound difference  between &quot;organic&quot; living (living before the machine) and a world  centered around the machine, both in environmental and human terms.  It is  a poignant, thought-provoking look at what many people have (a) taken for  granted and (b) not questioned, which is the direction current trends are  taking us, and the impact this has on us as beings created in the image of  God.  It is at once a reminiscence, a warning, a critique, and a prophecy  both taking to task technology, and enumerating its good points.  That it  was written so clearly and brilliantly in the early 1920s only highlights  Guardini's gift as a spokesman and prophet for this century - he had truly  inspiring insight and foresight on these matters.  Highly recommended.	1998-10-30

Preparing Yourself for the Mass, formerly Meditations Before Mass, by Romano Guardini, is a book discussing the meaning, symbolism and spirituality of the Mass.  He talks about the proper way to approach the  Mass, its significance, the difference between the arena of the Mass and  the &quot;marketplace&quot; of the world, the symbolism of the words  spoken, artifacts used, etc.  He also discusses, interwoven in this, the  significance of appearance, deportment and &quot;external symbolism&quot;  in the body of a man - spiritual vs &quot;worldly&quot; man - in other  words, how our outer appearance affects our inner state, and vice versa.  It is a very beautiful meditation on the importance of atmosphere,  appearance, dignity and respect, and the importance of being able to  discern chaos, bad taste, noise, affliction and those things which mitigate  against right relationship with God.  This is very important for the age we  live in, in which things spiritual are often under severe attack. Highly  recommended.	1998-10-30
US	52092363	R1SZQLA5KE6ZHO	0895267144	114448074	The Lord (None)	Books	5	78	78	N	N	This is a study of the life of Christ.	The Lord, by Romano Guardini, is a study of the life and person of Christ.  Romano Guardini was at once brilliant, profound, deeply holy, insightful and &quot;humanistic&quot;, and this look at the person of Christ reflects his essence as a &quot;humanistic&quot; man of God in our century.  Christ is studied intimately from a spiritual/&quot;psychological&quot; standpoint.  Guardini examines his profound holiness, his loneliness, his innocence, the misunderstanding and blindness he encountered, his origins, his impact on the men of his day, and of our times.  It is perhaps unparalleled in its intimacy and beauty of an examination of Christ, although, in my opinion, it is NOT amongst the best of Guardini's writings because it can be long, and at times obvious. His best books are, in my opinion, The Living God, The Virtues, Prayer in Practice, The Life of Faith, Power and Responsibility, The End of the Modern World, and The World and the Person (the original titles of these works when translated), but, nonetheless, it is, like everything he wrote, masterful and well worth reading END	1998-10-30
US	52092363	R1DPZGF7LPFKDY	0918477239	864068524	The Rosary of Our Lady	Books	5	19	19	N	N	This book is an act of contemplation.	The Rosary of Our Lady, by Romano Guardini, is a meditation on the rosary and the meaning of the rosary.  It is, in itself, like a visit to a haven - or garden - of contemplation.  It is restful, beautiful, deep and  illuminating.  It is a very sweet, holy little book, and discusses the form  of the rosary, the person of Mary, Christ, and our faith.  It is, like all  of Guardini's books, highly recommended and well worth reading.  Romano  Guardini's books are, in my opinion, the most important spiritual books of  this century - he was a great great author.	1998-10-30
US	52092363	R1FMEZPW1HUWRI	1568541333	83815498	The Essential Guardini	Books	5	67	68	N	N	A good introduction to the writing of Romano Guardini.	For those who have yet to discover Romano Guardini, I have only envy,  because discovering him was one of the turning points of my life.  The  Essential Guardini is excerpts from his writings, grouped by subject, and  selected by one of his former pupils, Heinz Kuehn.  Father Romano Guardini  lived through the Holocaust, was born at the end of the 19th century, and  died in 1968, so his life spanned the years before technology and  the  major two World Wars to after technology and after these wars.  With a foot  in both a pre-technological and post-technological world, with brilliance,  depth and profound vision, with insight and foresight, and with the  holiness God conferred on him, he was able to diagnose accurately the  problems of our age, pierce the angst of modern man to discuss our  spiritual foundation and essence, and prophesy about the direction  social/political and religious events were taking.  I, personally, think he  stands head and shoulders above ANY thinker on these issues in our current  day.  Because of the nature of his writing, it is easy to pick up excerpts  from different sources and read them - a paragraph from Sacred Signs, or a  page from Prayer in Practice, or even a line from The Virtues is sufficient  for nourishment, guidance, and edification, which makes this book both a  good introduction to his thought, and a primer for some of its high points.   Heinz Kuehn was one of his pupils, and one of the few living people today  who actually knew and was influenced by Guardini.  He, himself, is in a  very good position to put forth this anthology, because he is a massive  Christian model and figure.  I highly recommend this book as both an  introduction to Guardini's thought, a starting point for further  explorations, and a summary, put together by Kuehn, of some of his major  views.  The reader will find the writing brilliant but simple, profound but  clear, powerful but holy, and of such weight that one person said (I  paraphrase) that the strength of Guardini's writing knocks one to one's  knees.  Kuehn also writes an introduction that is very helpful in situating  the times out of which Guardini's writing came, and the force of his  personality and influence.  Highly recommended	1998-10-30

Living the Drama of Faith, formerly The Life of Faith, is a short book by Romano Guardini on the nature of faith, its stages, its evolution, and its importance in our lives.  Guardini chose his topics to impact the times in  which we live.  Knowing faith was what most needed strengthening in a  century of two world wars, the Holocaust, the bomb, technology, mass  communications and all, he chose this subject to do just that.  It is a  beautiful little book, certainly amongst his best, and sketches out man (in  the world) in proper relationship to God (creator of the world) and his  evolution towards this God.  So it is man in RIGHT relationship with God,  and moving in the RIGHT direction in his life.  Highly recommended.	1998-10-30
US	52092363	RXFGCWHPFIR0A	0918477212	361220926	The Art of Praying: The Principles and Methods of Christian Prayer/Formerly Entitled Prayer in Practice	Books	5	55	55	N	N	This book is a primer on prayer.	The Art of Praying, formerly Prayer in Practice, is one of Guardini's best books.  It is a primer on prayer, and covers all types of prayer, from liturgy, to oral, to contemplative, to all varieties. It is a book to strengthen one in the necessity and possibility of building one's life around prayer (or at the very least including it in daily actions) and, like all of Father Guardini's books, profoundly touches on all aspects of the spiritual life in the world - how to seek guidance, the proper deportment in spiritual matters, how to discern God's voice, the ebbs and flows of our spiritual life, the nature of man, God, and the right relationship of man to God.  It is a book of comfort, acceptance, and the dignity of man.  In an age that runs roughshod over the slow, the delicate and the organic, it celebrates the natural rhythms of our lives, and of God's dealings with us.  It is a book that is an experience in prayer itself to read. This is what marked all of Guardini's actions - to be in his presence OR to hear him speak OR to read one of his books was to come to an experience of the living presence of God, in itself, such was the power of this man.  This is not a book of details about technique - Guardini was not a technician - it is a book of spirituality and philosophy that, by its own holiness, takes one into the presence of God and elucidates timeless, God-given principles on the nature of prayer.  Highly recommended.	1998-10-17
US	52092363	R1ZNMWOAFXVFPR	0918477492	423208802	The Living God	Books	5	47	47	N	N	The Living God is a beautiful short book by Romano Guardini.	The Living God is a short book by Romano Guardini which is a treatise on  God as a living, active force in our lives, not just a concept of theology  to be studied on paper.  He starts with the face of God (what God looks  like), divine providence (God's care for our lives), then what God sees and  wills (God's control of everything) and goes into other facets of our relationship with God, always writing with clarity, holiness, and  profundity and always taking us back to the very simple truths about the  nature of God and man.  It is a beautiful beautiful book.  The part  describing God's face is one of the most beautiful I have come across in  religious writing.  Guardini is very very deep, but not at all frightening.   I highly recommend this book.  He is an excellent guide into the mysteries  of faith.	1998-10-17
US	52092363	R2CQR4HAY016OV	0918477646	409075493	Learning the Virtues: That Lead You to God	Books	5	90	91	N	N	This book is one of Guardini's best books.	This book, formerly titled The Virtues, is one of Guardini's best books.  It is a list of his chosen virtues, with a chapter devoted to each.  On  looking at the virtues he chooses, one sees the essence of his writing.  Some of them are: truthfulness, patience, justice, reverence, asceticism,  courage, kindness, courtesy, silence, justice before God - they are the  virtues of the interior man, the virtues drawn out of contemplation and  knowledge of the true nature of the human being.  They are also a statement  on the times in which we live, where truthfulness, justice, reverence,  courage, kindness, courtesy, and, most especially, silence are hard to come  by.  Guardini's gift is that he can penetrate the indoctrination,  distractions and ultimately, the lying of our age and pierce through to the  bedrock of our spirtuality, the nature of man, and man in relationship to  God.  His writings bring man back to what is essential, and strengthen him  in trying to live by these precepts.  One of Guardini's purposes in all  that he did was to shore up the faith in an age that attacks it  mercilessly, and in an age that tries to falsify the nature of man (in  advertising, media, manipulation, etc.)  This is a wonderful book.  It is  the holy stratosphere surrounding the throne of God.  Highly recommended.	1998-10-16
