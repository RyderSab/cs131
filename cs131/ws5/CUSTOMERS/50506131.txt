I got it with &quot;Bartlett's Roget's Thesaurus.&quot; <br />The indexing alone is well worth the money you'll pay for this, but if that's not enough, you might like the list of categories, (will and behaivior, spatial relations, negotiations &amp; fiscal relations, etc.) that are included both by concepts and alphabetically. In addition, there are a lot of lists included, from breeds of cattle to stations of the cross to varieties of beans. Makes for some interesting reading.<br />If *that* hasn't convinced you, the actual thesaurus part of it is darn good. Many times I turn to this reference book to prompt creativity, to expand on ideas, etc. The contemporary terms and phrases and relationships between words and concepts are quite good. If you appreciate good resources, this is going to be a great desk item for you.	2001-05-17

Since I didn't know much more about the Craft than what has been portrayed in the media, I found the &quot;Guide&quot; to be a good introduction to Wicca. Certainly, I'm not in a coven right now, and need to do a lot more reading before I'll be able to say I'm a Wiccan, that I believe in Wicca, or before I'll be performing any rites. While reading the &quot;Guide&quot; I felt a connection with the author, as though he understood my confusion about my spiritual path. He didn't give me more information than I could handle.<br />What the &quot;Guide&quot; *was* able to provide me with was an introduction to Wicca, the practices, rites, and deities. No one should expect this book to answer all their questions. It will, however, show you the way to *more* questions, etc. Go find more books!	2001-05-03

Stranded in the Southwest when their Mystery Machine once again bites the dust (you'd think as grown-ups they'd have AAA and cell phones by now), the gang finds the locals are being kidnapped by aliens and experimented on before they're returned (safely) home. But are they *really* aliens?<br />If your kids enjoyed the movie version of &quot;Scooby Doo and the Alien Invaders&quot; they'll surely enjoy this little paperback based on the movie. The illustrations are bright and colorful and full of energy. My four-year old &quot;reads&quot; this to himself and just loves looking at the detailed pictures.<br />If your children love Scooby Doo but you're afraid the movie version of &quot;Alien Invaders&quot; might be too scary for them, this would be a nice compromise.	2001-04-12

Warshawski in the pages of &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; I found incredible likenesses with Sue Grafton's heroine of her Alphabet series. And by the end, I was equally annoyed and bored by her dull exposition and smarty-pants comments that were just not funny. I would have liked more thought in presenting some clues (we were presented with answers instead of clues that rolled out for us to piece together with the detective) than all the endless droning about cranky neighbors, jerky ex-husbands, pregnant dogs and worn-out running shoes.<br />I found myself annoyed with myself halfway through for bothering to finish &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; because I honestly, could not have cared less about what happened.	2001-04-01

Throughout the year Jesse Bear announces &quot;how he says *it*&quot; each month. We don't know what *it* is till the last page, and by then, even I wasn't curious any more. The ryhming text is not always closely related to a season (September: &quot;With clothes that don't fit and no place to sit, I say it with buttons today.&quot;) and won't make sense to young listeners. <br />The illustrations are colorful and busy, and young kids will enjoy the activity.

Not only does this book prepare young (under 6?) children for a new sitter experience, but maybe it also will teach kids how to behave with grown-ups.<br />Mrs. Grizzly has a spunky personality that kids will warm up to and parents will enjoy reading aloud.

As a college student my favorite dish was the fresh tomato, basil and ricotta sauce on ziti. Yum! When I was a nanny for a California family with California taste, recipes like the spaghetti with blue cheese and walnuts saved my fanny. And now that I'm married and cook for my extended family, one of my favorite potluck dishes is the &quot;light and easy&quot; Salad of Penne and Chicken with Spinach and Buttermilk Dressing. My family loves it too.<br />I love the spiral binding and hard cover that lay flat. The different chapters (&quot;Asian Connection,&quot; &quot;No-Cook Sauces&quot;) etc. make for good browsing. And I like that many additions are offered too. <br />Lots of times I pull out a variety of things from my fridge and cupboard and then go to this cookbook to figure out what to make. For example, if I had leftover spaghetti, some eggs, and a handful of veggies to chop up, I could bang out a delicious spaghetti frittata that I know my family would love.<br />This cookbook has been a staple in my kitchen for 11 years and has held up wonderfully!	2001-03-11

The pictures are copy an Impressionist-era style (nice for adults) but have a lot going on in them, from the bees that constantly hover over the sweet grapes to the grape pickers rushing to fill the gondolas. I love the fact that the author doesn't talk down to her audience, she talks about gondolas instead of &quot;big trucks&quot; and grape cutting knives instead of &quot;cutters.&quot; Every character has a different voice, and the aspects of family life, community pride, migrant farming, and the life of a four-year old are all highlighted without the author shoving it in your face. <br />I highly recommend this book to children 4-8 and their parents.	2001-02-23

US	50506131	R3O84BC0SLGHKG	0671793888	142079702	Cowboys Are My Weakness	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Strong writing, strong voice, strong &amp; weak women	I'd enjoy meeting the people who didn't enjoy this collection of strong, entertaining stories. Houston has a good ear for language and the emotions she evokes with her rythmns. She is good at writing about strong women who make bad choices out of weakness, and weak women who make strong choices out of fear. <br />My 30-year old husband devoured this book, as did my 19-year old female neice (who only reads soccer magazines). It's not just a Gen-X chick thing as some may say.<br />This is Pam Houston at her strongest! (If you loved it, stay with it, steer clear of &quot;Waltzing the Cat&quot;.)	2000-10-04
US	50506131	R2WTOR7OXPJD09	0240802446	348877364	Managing Multimedia Projects	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A Decent Introduction	&quot;Managing Multimedia Projects&quot; is a good introduction for the software/multimedia newbie, or for the manager who needs to understand the basics of what the staff is talking about. I used this book as a jumping off point, and found the chapters on &quot;The Perils of Partnership&quot; and planning and scheduling most helpful. <br />However, Strauss covers a lot of ground (web sites, kiosks, slide shows, cd-roms) in about 200 pages, which means that the surface has only been scratched. Read this to figure out what it is you don't know, then come back to Amazon.com.	2000-10-03

I've lost *50* pounds on the Weight Watchers 123 plan in the past six months. I've run through the gamut of the usual diet dishes, and was getting pretty bored, so picked this up at a meeting. I enjoyed the variety of dishes, and while I haven't cooked a lot of the recipies yet, the ones I have tried are good.<br />I like the range of the lunch ideas especially, because I was getting pretty tired of frozen entrees and canned soup! Another nice thing is the paper is sturdy and glossy, not like regular magazine paper. If I spill on it, I can wipe it off without destrying the page.<br />It's packed with pictures-- something I really like. Also, the recipies are easy to throw together with what you have in your pantry.	2000-10-03

I'm new to the Travis McGee series- this is my second-- and I enjoyed it for MacDonald's style, McGee's machismo, and the overall mystery.<br />However, there's lot of exposition in &quot;One Fearful Yellow Eye&quot; and MacDonald is better at showing rather than telling. It wasn't as good as &quot;Deadly Shade of Gold&quot; and I'm sure there are others that are better also. <br />It's worth the time just for the rant on why Americans should carry their own paper towels and toilet paper. A good read, way better than any Kellerman, Grafton or Jance.	2000-10-03

I was lucky enough to keep my old, splattered, grimy Joy that is in five pieces, handed down from mother to daughter to friend. I'm glad I did, because the chocolate sauce recipe for &quot;the kind of sauce that hardens on ice cream&quot; is not in the new one.<br />(Neither is a recipe for good, crispy roast potatos, but I've tried others instead.)<br />I won't be able to find out how to clean a deer in this version, but I *might* be able to learn how to make a good, spicy Cuban-style pork sandwich. And that's okay by me.	2000-10-03
US	50506131	R1884HJXKB6IQ5	0517881225	828667068	Great Good Food: Luscious Lower-Fat Cooking	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Fun to read but not used very often	I enjoy all the tidbits and information in this cookbook, but like other reviewers, find the layout annoying. I don't want to have to figure out that carrot soup could be a Winter dish or New Year's Eve brunch or for the Corn Threshing Party. I want soup in the soup section!<br />It has given me good ideas for entertaining, and I do like the caesar dressing and buttermilk turkey pasta salad. But cookbooks that have special recipies (the Great Good Blend, which is cottage cheese and buttermilk and strained yogurt or something)and then includes it in a majority of the subsequent recipies is obnoxious. If I don't have a pot of that on hand, I'm not going to whip one up just to make some low fat dressing.<br />But, I wouldn't give this cookbook away, and I've spent many an hour thumbing through it.	2000-10-03

I've been on Weight Watcher 123 plan for 6 months and have lost 50 pounds in that time. I have used a number of recipees for entrees (Mexican Casserole), brunches (spinach frittatas), and even desert (a pretty good chocolate CAKE)! There are some unusual recipies in here like black bean pancakes that I've enjoyed...not just the plain old diet food.<br />My husband was NOT on a diet, so I never bother to tell him if I'm cooking &quot;diet food&quot; and he has never noticed a difference. Except...his waist size has gone down.<br />The recipes are easy to read and assemble, and I like the use of icons to show if it's a microwave recipe or a quickie meal, etc. And I also like that the ingredients for most of the recipies are ones that I would normally buy!	2000-10-03

However, the second half of &quot;Moon Music&quot; is so far from any of the clues or what I expected that I despised the book entirely. Did Kellerman just not have a clue as to who-done-it?<br />If you like way-out-there things and SUPER twists, you might like &quot;Moon Music.&quot; I hated it.	2000-09-28

It never gets very deep into any one area, and has lots of helpful tips in many different areas. While I'm not going to make a banner or awning for my office, and don't have the money for an all-out market research effort, I was reminded of the sorts of creativity and actions the competition can and does take.<br />Good for the person who dabbles in marketing and can't afford a real, live PR/Marketer.	2000-09-28

However, the movie version of &quot;The General's Daughter&quot; is different enough from the book in terms of characterization, suspense, and relationships that I enjoyed the book *after* the movie. Masterpiece Theater it ain't. But not bad for something to read on the plane.	2000-09-28

Bad URLs, Netscape Navigator 1.1, and WebStar? I can't believe this book is still listed as being in print. Another reviewer mentioned the heavy use of HoTMetaL-- do yourself a favor.

MacDonald, and it won't be my last. I love the tough-as-nails-and-oh-so-smart Travis McGee. I love MacDonald's funny philosophical rants about society and the environment. And I love the 60's flavor of this book. I can't believe a movie hasn't been made of this yet, because it certainly is a visual tale. (And not a bad mystery, either!)	2000-09-28

Like many other reviewers, &quot;Cowboys&quot; is one of my most tattered collections on my bookshelf. I have giving &quot;Cowboys&quot; as presents many times, and recommended it countless others. <br />I was eager to see how  Houston had grown in the few years since &quot;Cowboys&quot; was published,  and was disappointed to find she hadn't. &quot;Waltzing the Cat&quot; reads  like a volume of B-side tunes.

Quite possibly she needs to  write less from her life and more from her heart.	1999-12-22

Jan Beatty captures the beauty of Pittsburgh head-on in &quot;Mad River.&quot; She also taps into the pain of growing- whether as a child or an adult- with real, raw emotion. There's a certain sadness that runs  through this collection that is tinged with amusement, curiosity, and  frankness. From &quot;Not Thinking about Gardenias&quot; to &quot;Grabbing  at Beauty,&quot; Beatty's voice continuously surprises and challenges the  reader.	1999-12-22
