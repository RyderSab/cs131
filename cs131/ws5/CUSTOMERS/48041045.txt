Singularity Sky is an excellent scifi yarn and compelling space opera.  Stross has created a very interesting universe where 90% of the Earth's population  has been forcibly removed from Earth (by the Eschaton, a super intelligence) and distributed in such a way as to create some very unique cultures.  The trouble starts when the Carnival, who are masters of matter transformation, create anything and everything any wants on one of the colonies of the New Republic.  This of course destroys the colony's economy and feudal government.  The New Republic attempts to respond to this threat with conventional warships, not truly understanding what they are up against.  Singularity Sky follows two visitors to the New Republic from Earth who do understand how badly the New Republic are overmatched and attempt to lead them in a more rational direction, especially when the New Republic attempts to use time travel to gain an advantage.  The universe where this all takes place is quite fascinating and the characters are well written.  Stross adds a bit of mystery to the story as the goals of the earthlings are revealed to the reader and to the both of them.  Definitely a worthwhile read.	2005-10-09

After Death	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A horror novel from a scifi author that almost works	Dead Lines is a slightly odd, but overall very good novel.  It is not really SciFi, which is obviously Bear's speciality, rather it is billed as a horror novel.  Dead Line's protagonist, Peter Russell is a somewhat failed writer and movie director who is now in the employ of a rich eccentric as a sort of Boy Friday. As such, he is presented with the opportunity to work for Trans, a new telecom company that has invented a cell phone technology that works anywhere and apparently transmits it's signal through some parallel netherworld.  The recent death of his best friend and his continued grief over the murder of his daughter makes him wonder if he is losing his mind when it appears he is communing with the dead.  He slowly begins to make sense of the strange events and realizes it is the Trans phones that have opened a conduit into the next world.  The climax of the novel (which I will not spoil here) is a bit disappointing and out of place, but none-the-less it adds the appropriate horror element to complete the story.	2005-10-07

I am going to review the American Empire series: Blood and Iron, The Center Cannot Hold and The Victorious Opposition in one review.  It is pointless to read the books individually, as they are really one novel broken up into three parts for convenience.  The American Empire series covers the period betwen the Great War (the WWI parallel between the North and South) and the Second World War.  While not as exciting as the other parts of the overall alternative history series, mainly due to the absence of any major combat, the series does an admirable job of further developing the characters from the Great War series as they struggle through the Great Depression.  In American Empire, Turtledove brings us much closer to each of the families involved in his history and their individual successes and tragedies.  Paralleling the Weimar Republic in 1930s Germany, the Confederate States suffer through crushing economic failure and finally turn to the Freedom Party for new leadership.  Jake Featherson, leader of the Freedom Party emerges as the Hitler character with his complete takeover of the Confederate government and insane designs on its citizens that oppose him.  This subplot is the most compelling part of the series.  Whereas in 2005 we have to wonder how a man like Hitler could become chancellor of Germany and twist his citizens to his radical designs, Turtledove shows how it can be done easily as long as you have the support of the police and enough backers willing to do violence on the opposition.  Meanwhile, the United States are under the governance of the Socialists, who are loathe to take the threat from the South seriously.  Of course, this leads to the Second Great War, which is launched just as the series ends.	2005-10-06

Shadow of the Giant is the conclusion of the Bean saga, although Card did leave an open door for Bean to return someday with two children suffering his affectation (that is supergenius and giantism).  Like the rest of the Bean novels, Bean must manipulate the geopolitical landscape on Earth in order to ensure survival of the species while battling his personal demons (both literally and figuratively).  As usual Card succeeds with wrapping it all up in a very compelling drama leaving the fan wanting even more stories about the Battle School kids.  Unfortunately, they are becoming rather formulaic at this point and it might be time to let it go.  One interesting side story in Shadow of the Giant, clarified by First Meetings, is Bean's accidental creation of Jane by forcing Graff to reassign the Battle School AI program to managing Ender's money.  With that, Bean has now eclipsed Ender in every way.  It's ironic that it is called the Endervese, when Bean is actually the more interesting and more accomplished character.  Regardless, anyone who has read all 6 or so prequels has no reason to stop now, Shadow of the Giant is an excellent, if a little predictable, continuation of the saga.	2005-08-30

On the highest level, the story itself is tremendously compelling.  I think I read State of Fear over just three or four nights, during which I got very little sleep.  Crichton is the master of making his characters the most interesting people in the world.  Even if they are just scientists or even lawyers.  On the next level, the science or politics depending on your point of view, is very interesting and heavily footnoted.  The underlying theme of the novel is that environmentalists use bad science or outright lies to further their agenda.  He has several very transparent scenes where the protagonists simply refuse to believe the evidence that is right in front of their noses, much like many of the people that read this book I'm sure.  It's hard to read State of Fear and just ignore the science, unless you are prone to just ignore any science that doesn't agree with the prevailing view of Hollywood and the media.  Finally, on the most basic level it is fascinating that Crichton even wrote this book.  The fact that this book exists is testimony that Crichton has no fear or that he just has \\"all the money\\" and is turning into a crotchety old man.	2005-08-30

Like Ender's Game itself, First Meetings is simple, straightforward and fantastic.  Card really seems to shine when he is not trying to reach too far (e.g. the near disaster that was Speaker for the Dead.)  First Meetings is a must read for any Enders Game fan, for in it we learn that Ender's father was actually the prototype for the Wiggin genius and he was actually manipulated in some ways to produce children that could save the world.  That whole idea is very reminiscent of the manipulation done to Ender when he was \\"training\\" to fight the buggers.  It's interesting that Card's world view is such that people have to be manipulated to do what is best for them and for society.  I am not sure exactly how that meshes with his religious and political views, but I'm sure they are related somehow.  Regardless, I heartily recommend First Meetings for any SciFi fan, even if you have never read the rest of the Ender and Bean stories.	2005-08-30

Of course it makes sense to want to explore what eventually happened to the new species that evolved in Darwin's Radio, but that of course leads Bear to attempt to write a political novel of how society reacts to real or perceived threats to human health or well-being.  While the book was an interesting read and definitely a page turner, I just couldn't suspend disbelief over the concentration camps and flat out human evilness that was dreamed up by Bear as a result of these children.  Overall, I would have liked more dramatic changes in the children and less dramatic changes in society.	2005-08-29

The first thing you will notice when reading Burndive is that their is essentially no burndiving in it.  This is one of those interesting cases where the publisher must have picked the title, because it has nothing to do with the book.  That being said, Burndive is an excellent follow-up to Warchild, this time focusing on the son of the enigmatic Captain Azarcon of the Macedon.  Azarcon's 18-year-old son Ryan doesn't know his father, since he has been away his whole life, but his father's politics have led to an attack on Ryan's life which brings them into very close quarters.  Burndive is less military scifi and more space opera, but the characters are compelling and deep and excellently drawn.  The book is a little slow at first, but ends with a flourish that left me searching Amazon for the unfortunately unavailable sequel.  I will be looking forward to it. <br />	2004-07-29

When 8-year-old Jos Musey's merchant ship is killed by pirates, he is taken prisoner and made the pet of the pirate leader.  After escaping into the hands of the strits, and alien race who are warring with the humans, he is taken in by the human leader of the aliens known as Warboy.  Jos spends several years with Warboy and learns the way of the strits.  Warboy sends Jos to infiltrate the human fleet as a soldier and Jos' loyalties are transferred again, this time to the ship's captain.  Very reminiscent of the Ender's Game series, Warchild has excellent character development.  There is something about little kids as soldiers that is imminently believable in the scifi genre.  It is probably because a child's confusion about their lot in life is similar to the reader's inability to fully grasp the implications of the futuristic world.  There was also a somewhat moving subtheme about human slavery and what happens to children in terrible circumstances.	2004-07-18

In The Peace War, one of his first novels, Vinge explores a world where all technology is banned by the &quot;Peace Authority&quot; in the name of protecting the peace.  In this weird anachronistic society underground groups (the Tinkers) create very high tech devices, while travelling around on horseback.  With the help of a crippled prodigy, the Tinkers believe they have one final chance to attack the Peace Authority and wrest the world from their control.  The Peace War contains scads of hard science and the mechanism by which the Peace Authority controls the peace, the Bobble which is a bubble in which time does not move, is quite ingenious.	2004-07-18

It is possible, though not satisfying to read only the first one.  I really enjoyed the first novel, Left Behind (well enough to read the next 11), although I actually stopped reading it for a while because the focus on the disbelievers was maddening.  Millions of people all over the world disappear at once (coicidentally the die-hard Christians), and there is some question about what has happened?  I suppose LeHaye and Jenkins were trying to convey just how ridiculous the non-Christians must seem to the Christians, but it was a bit overboard and actually a little boring.  Anyway, our heroes finally accept Christ and the rest of the novels were action packed page turners.  Of course, the Antichrist takes over rule of the world using the UN and the promise of world peace.  I actually laughed out loud when the Antichrist was promising peace and extolling the exact sentiments you hear in the average Hillary Clinton speech (coincidence?). The novels read just an epic disaster novel and were just as fun.  I would warn people who are anti-religion that the preaching is a little thick, but I enjoyed it and it was necessary to set the proper tone.	2004-07-18

HIAJTVRWC is a relatively entertaining and thankfully somewhat short tome describing Harry Stein's transition from an Upper-West side liberal to a normal person.  Right-wing?  Hardly.  Stein begins with the obligatory litany of liberal credentials which for most people would be called &quot;youthful foolishness.&quot;  Everything changes when Harry and wife conceive at which time they notice that all their selfish liberal friends are well, selfish liberals.  One of the first shots across Stein's liberal bow is noticing that children kinda need parents and it is absurd to assert that they would be &quot;better off&quot; in day-care than at home.  Unfortunately, being a liberal there is no one within 10 square miles that would agree with his assessment.  The final brick in Stein's transformation is of course the whole Bill Clinton impeachment controversy.  Like most people Stein cannot figure out why anyone would defend Clinton's behavior.  Sure, I can see where some might say it was not impeachable, but Stein's friends were actually defending the man (Gore made the same mistake and I still think that is what cost him the election).  As an actual member of the VRWC I did enjoy Stein's awakening and found it really cute that he considers himself a &quot;right-winger&quot;, unfortunately by his definition of &quot;right-winger&quot; about 75% of American's are too.  Of course, after writing this book he has probably been kicked even further to the right by his liberal friends and neighbors, so maybe there is hope for him yet.	2004-04-17

(btw, I really appreciate Del Rey for publishing these in one book).  All three are tightly coupled and deserve to be read together.  The basic premise of the trilogy is man's discovery of his origins after a 50,000 year-old human corpse is found in a cave on the moon.  This is followed by the discovery of a 20 million year old spaceship on Jupiter's moon Ganymede that contains both alien corpses and animal specimens that clearly came from Earth.  It was very fun to follow our protagonist Vic Hunt as he works to come up with a plausible explanation for these discoveries and how they fit into man's evolution.  Much of the speculation is made clearer by the arrival of a 20 million year-old spaceship full of live aliens who used to inhabit our solar system.  Seems they had some technical problems and although they had only been gone for 20 years their time, relativistic effects delayed their return by 20 million years.  Eventually we learn that the returned aliens are not the last of their species as their forbearers moved to another star system millions of years before.  When they make contact with their long lost descendents events are put in motion that forces their ancient species to get help from Earth to combat the biggest threat in their history.	2004-04-17

Orion leads a band of cloned soldiers in a galactic civil war that pits Creator against Creator.  In this novel Orion is again out of place, but this time he does not have the advantage of his understanding of the future to help him in his battles.  The story's action is just as strong as the previous 4 Orion books, but Bova introduces some unique new ideas in this book, such as cloned soldiers who are frozen between battles and do not have the rights one would expect human beings to have.  In one interesting sequence Orion is arguing with an old time Army officer that the soldiers deserve a batter life, while the officer cannot get over the idea that they were cloned to be warriors and they are somewhat less than human.  Obviously, this parallels Orion's own existence.  Bova also introduces the idea that there are other species in the galaxy with more power than even the Creators, and those advanced species do not want to get involved in the petty disputes of the less advanced species.  This acts as a reminder that the Creators themselves are descended from humans, because their strongest desire is for war and domination.  Sadly, this is the last Orion novel and while Bova ended it on the same note of continuation, it does not look like Orion will be resurrected anytime soon.	2004-02-27

The book reads like a transcript of his radio show, and most of the jokes do not translate well to paper (Larry &quot;Selzer&quot; haha). Anyone who has listened to his show more than 10 times would not find anything new in this book.  I have no basic disagreement with his message:  both the Replicrats and Democrans are selling us out and destroying the country.  Savage is at least passionate about his subject, but the material in the book is kinda tired.	2004-02-27

As Philip struggles to conquer/unite Greece, Alexander's mother, who is one of the Creators, struggles to ensure the ascension of Alexander to the throne.  This is Orion at his best, fighting with swords and knives as he struggles with his personal loyalties versus the desires of the Creators.  As Orion's powers develop, he continues to try to find the mystery behind the intentions of The Golden One.  A quick fun read, Orion and the Conquerer is definitely worthwhile despite the one shortcoming of Orion's constant whining about finding Anya, the Creator he loves.	2004-02-27

In Vengeance of Orion, Orion leads the Greeks to victory over Troy, the Israelites to victory over Jericho and prevents a royal conspiracy in ancient Egypt.  Bova obviously did a lot of research into the events covered and the storyline is eminently believable.  Like the first novel, Vengeance is more like historical fiction than science fiction, in fact there is very little interference from the Creators or others this time.	2004-02-15

Unfortunately, in the Dying Time was not nearly as intriguing as the first two novels in the series.  The alien Set is not a very interesting opponent and the seemingly unfair advantage he has over the humans in virtually every situation is somewhat ridiculous.  Orion even travels back to the Cretaceous Period to do battle with Set (Set created the dinasaurs much the same way that the Creators created human beings).  The ending of Orion in the Dying Time was shaping up to be very interesting with Orion using his developing powers to bring 1000 Mongol warriors back in time to do battle with Set, but they didn't even get involved in the final outcome.	2004-02-15

After a present day incident where Orion (the Hunter) preserves the invention of fusion power, he travels back through time to critical junctures in the development of mankind to foil the plans of Ahriman, who is bent on destroying the human race.  Orion seems to have no unearthly powers (he is sent back in time by God or his equivalent), and Ahriman seems to be able to control time and space, but Orion manages to perserver.  Between the sequences where Orion travels backwards through time Bova also sheds some light on the god who is managing this process.  I actually found that substoryline to be the most compelling part of the story after a while.  It appears that this god is convinced the universe will be destroyed should Ahriman succeed and thus he needs Orion to stop him.  Sounds kind of trite I know, but the historical and mystery aspects of the novel were very well done.  Orion is a real page turner (turns out it is a series also).	2004-02-08

Liberals line up against the United States on pretty much every issue and relentlessly attack anyone who actually points that out (McCarthy, et al).  In my opinion, the reason this book was not as big a hit as Slander is that frankly it is pretty boring at times.  She spends way too much time rehashing the same point over and over about the Cold War.  Anyone who is over the age of 30 knows quite clearly that the liberals were rooting (literally) for the Soviet Union.  Anyone who has ever read a newspaper or listens to the Hollywood idiots on E! can reasonably infer McCarthy was probably not as bad as he is made out to be.  She did not have to beat the point with a dead horse.  It was somewhat fascinating to learn that the recently released CIA intercepts from the period (Venona cables) proved much of what McCarthy was claiming, but again, who is surprised?  It occurred to me as I was finishing Treason that I wish someone would figure out why the liberals are so anti-American.  Treason puts forth a reasonable argument for the fact of it, but provides no explanation for the problem.	2004-02-08

Breakthroughs wraps up the story of WWI as fought on American soil and at risk of giving away the ending: the US wins.  Turtledove brings closure to most of the stories he has woven into the war.  Some end well, others in tragedy.  There were some very interesting twists and turns, not the least of which is that General Custer turns out to be the hero of the war.  He also sets many of the cast up for their part in the American Empire series which follows.  The main complaint I have about Breakthroughs (and the entire series in general) is Turtledove's need to rehash the core point of each story as he switches back and forth between them.  In theory one could read any of the books independently, but I don't think he should have wasted the space rehashing every little thing that happened in the first two novels over and over again.	2004-01-10

Coulter's sardonic story of the left in America is well documented and irrefutable (she has already responded to the liberal attacks on her book and does admit a serious error:  the NY Times did run a front page story about the death of Dale Earnhardt).  Of course, now that Slander has been thoroughly repudiated by the left, there is really no point reviewing it.  Actually, that is a good example of the basic premise of Slander, the liberals tendency to throw the baby out with the bath water.  If you can disprove one paragraph on the last page of a book, then the other 204 pages with thousands of footnotes must also be false.  Coulter brings this type of scenario up an excellent argument for the failure of the left to accomplish anything for the past 40 years (oh yea, what have they accomplished then?)  The left repudiates an entire 205 page argument based on one paragraph and is given cover by the media.  This has led to a kind of intellectual laziness on the part of the left.  Since they are never forced to defend themselves for their bizarre beliefs, their beliefs tend to become even more bizarre and ordinary Americans reject them even more.  The good news is the left has learned a darn thing and we can assume conservatism will continue to win for a long time to come.	2003-11-27

Elzith, the best spy in the ruling judge's secret army was found as a baby by thieves in a trash pile.  Her life pretty much goes downhill from there (figuratively).  Elzith is tortured by those she has killed, tortured by the abuse to her own body and somewhat tortured by her magical abilities that make her what she is.  Tod Redtanner, is also tortured, but by failure and fear.  When Elzith rents the room in his apartment, he falls in love with her and does everything he can to help her.  While this may sound somewhat trite, it is difficult to convey the interesting world where Welch sets this tale.  As Elzith recounts her story to Tod, one can't help but notice the parallels with all society (corruption of its leaders, their opaque goals).  I had never heard of this book and picked it up on a whim, I am glad I did and look forward to the sequel due out in August '04.	2003-11-27

Destiny's Road is a fairly slow paced character study that contains a fair amount of science fiction, but mostly low tech.  The protagonist of the novel, Jeremy Bloocher commits a murder (albeit in self-defense) and is uprooted from his safe existence in a very small colony of Earthlings on a distant planet.  We follow Jeremy as he gets further from his home and begins to learn the secrets of Destiny.  Jeremy is very well written and the world Niven has created is interesting enough to keep you turning pages.  The main complaint I have is that the scope of the world is too small (maybe 100kms from end to end) for such the dichotomy of existence Jeremy found.	2003-11-17

One of the senior races has decided to attack and control a human outpost as a punishment of sorts for the issue with the Progenitors (see book 2). The invaders, big ... intelligent birds, are tricked into making more of an investment than planned and also clearly underestimate the human's primate cousins. Unfortunately, nothing happens, we never get off the annoying planet and nothing is resolved. I can see now why he had to write 3 (or 4 or whatever) more books in the series. Just keep repeating: \\"I will not read book 4, I will not read book 4...\\"	2003-11-07

You could review this book with two words: &quot;talking dolphins.&quot;  To be fair however, the dolphins were actually pretty interesting.  In Startide Rising we return to the universe Brin has created where races &quot;Uplift&quot; promising species by genetically engineering their intelligence.  Lo and behold the simple wolfling humans (actually dolphins for the most part in a ship full of water, good grief) have discovered the missing Progenitors, the supposed parent race of everyone else.  At any rate, hilarity ensues as the dolphins crash land on a watery planet (lucky) and attempt to hide while the advanced races fight it out for who gets to capture the clever dolphins and learn the secret of the Progenitors.	2003-11-06

Sundiver is book one of the Uplift Saga, in which the galaxy is filled with races who have genetically engineered intelligence into non-sentient beings thus &quot;uplifting&quot; them.  The uplifted races then must submit to a period of indentured servitude (100,000 years or so) to pay their patron race for their uplift.  This process has apparently been going on since the first intelligent race uplifted a client race.  The human race however managed to uplift itself, that is, has intelligence without a patron.  While humans are not the first &quot;wolfling&quot; race, they are generally looked down upon by the galaxy's glitteratti.  What follows is intrigue (to some extent) and mystery as some our of Earth's benefactors are in fact trying to diminish humankind.  A bit too slow at times and not terribly compelling.  Still, the idea is unique and worth of more attention.  I plan on reading the next two in the series to see how it goes (there are 5 so far).	2003-03-31

Shadow Puppets continues the saga started in Shadow of the Hegemon (apparently they were originally one book), where the Chinese have taken over half the world with the insane Achilles driving their strategy.  Although the beginning of Shadow Puppets suffered the same weaknesses of SotH (namely the inclusion of Achilles), most of the story ignores him and introducing interesting new characters and plot points.  I can definitely recommend Shadow Puppets to anyone reading the series.	2003-02-21

No I don't get the title either then.  Shadow of the Hegemon is all about Bean and his old nemesis Achilles and Bean's attempt to foil Achilles' little game of Risk and rescue his beloved Petra.  The military strategy and geopolitical aspects of Shadow of the Hegemon easily overcame any weakness in the story.  Rather than personal characterizations this novel is more like a thriller:  will the brilliant Bean succeed?  what will the insane Achilles do next?  what is his plan?  This may be explained by the afterword in which Card explains that this was really half a novel (the other half of which is now Shadow Puppet's I guess).  Not nearly as moving or intense as Ender's Shadow, SotH is still a fine piece of work with a strong story and a page turning suspense level.	2003-02-16

For one thing, the story is very obtuse and quite frankly, boring. The two main characters are so similar I found it very difficult to keep track of which was which. And put it all together and it really wasn't that bad. The world in which The Mind Pool is set had enough interesting qualities to overcome the lack of plot.

When I noticed it was written in 1949 I was a bit concerned, but it was not dated at all. The simple synopsis of the story is that everyone on the planet dies in a plague, except for a few hundred people. The story follows Ish, who was a ecologist or something and is now forced into the role of designing plans for rebuilding civilization. Along with a few others he meets and adds to his community, the book follows Ish's &quot;tribe&quot; for about 60 years. During that time the human build infrastructure deteriorates along with Ish's hopes of quickly restoring an active civilization. I would like to especially credit Stewart for including two long chapters he calls &quot;Quick Years&quot;, where he moves ahead 10 or 20 years. A less confident author would fill that 20 years with the same nonsense over and over making this a much slower and longer book.	2002-11-24

This novel was far less intriguing, which is ironic since it played out as a mystery. I we remember the end of Man Plus, there is the implication that machine intelligence has tricked mankind into colonizing Mars in order to protect its own interests (since man might wipe out Earth and thus the machine intelligence too). Mars Plus is a mystery where all the players are manipulated by the machines, but it just isn't very mysterious or clever. I think Pohl phoned this one in without exploring the many facets of what the existence of a manipulative machine intelligence would mean.	2002-11-03

The story itself is relatively intriguing as we learn how the thranx view the humans and to a much lesser extent, how humans view the thranx.  There is also an element of mystery as both the protagonists, one human and one thranx are essentially evading authorities.  The problem I have with Phylogenesis is that they are both evading authority because they are both criminals.  It almost seems like Foster is trying to assert that one can (and must) do anything they want to achieve their goals, even if that means lying and even killing.  If you can get past that fact, the story is just as readable as any of Foster's others.	2002-03-31

First, he's going to get beat up. A lot. After you explain to him that &quot;violence doesn't solve anything&quot; and you refuse to let him retaliate, he will grow confused and his grades will begin to suffer. (After all, violence solved the little dilemma about what to spend his lunch money on, didn't it?). Having already fallen out of favor with his classmates for being a sniveling coward, his teacher will now begin to harrass him about his classroom performance. And the poor little guy will have to go home to you telling him to quell every urge and instinct that he has as a male. He will feel afraid. Lost. Unaccepted and ostrasized at every turn. He will grow quiet and shy. He won't be able to use the restroom with the other boys watching. And he will retreat further and further within himself, which will cause him to get beat up more, which will cause his grades to suffer, which will invoke still more of your flawed philosphies about child-rearing........and the vicious circle continues.<br />At best, he will grow into a &quot;geek&quot; and be capable of interaction solely with computers. He will never have a date, a first kiss, a son of his own. His lack of social skills will relegate him to the janitorial profession. His life will pass without love or friendship or acceptance or understanding.<br />At worst, the term &quot;loner&quot; will be applied to him after yet another school tragedy.<br />Surely you'd want to avoid either of these scenarios, right?<br />If you are a single mother struggling with how to raise a boy, I am sympathetic to that. But instead of filling both your minds with senseless garbage about &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;racism&quot; and &quot;homophobia&quot;, I suggest that you go out and get yourself a man. And I mean a real MAN. The kind that can kill a saber-toothed tiger with one blow from a stone axe. That's what the both of you need: a proper role model for your young son, and someone who can protect and provide for you.<br />However, if you ARE married, please march up to your husband right now and explain to him why you want to turn his strapping young man into a frightened, insecure loser.nd &quot;homophobia&quot;, I suggest that you go out and get yourself a man.

The first fiction novel by Russell, a published anthropologist, the story is particularly slow and bland.  It doesn't really tell us much about human nature or even alien nature for that matter.  Emilio's search for God, the real focus of the story, is not really moving and you cannot share his joy and fear as he believe he finds Him.  There is also a bit of inconsistency with the characters, for example, the most intelligent among the party is the one that dooms them to be shipwrecked on the foreign planet and then eventually gets most of them killed.  Not really very intelligent.  I am skipping the sequel.	2002-01-01

Written in 1951, The Demolished Man is actually a murder, suspense novel set in the distant future.  The fairly weak plot has the main character, (an industrialist) murder his corporate opponent, even though no one has gotten away with a murder in 70 years.  The reason is simple, the police prefect and a small but important segment of the population have ESP.  The police prefect &quot;cheats&quot; and reads our killer's mind, thus confirming he is guilty, but then must spend 75% of the story coming up with non-ESP proof, because apparently ESP is not admissible in court.  Anyway, the whole story was rather preposterous with a number of flaws.

Labeled fascist by some, I would call is realistic and rational instead.  After the failure of democracy and various and sundry world-wars, the human race decides that political power falls in the wrong hand and henceforth only \\"citizens\\" can vote or hold political office.  The only way to become a citizen is to serve as a soldier, which is generally peacetime duty.  The reason for this is simple, only those people who actually care about their fellow man, as demonstrated by a willingness to die for them, have adequately demonstrated that they are fit to serve society (rather than just serve themselves...).  We follow the initiation of one Juan Rico as he makes the transition from civilian to soldier and citizen.  The terrifying war with the bugs is just an interesting backdrop to make the soldiers sacrifice more meaningful and actually plays a fairly small part in the book .  It's worth noting that Starship Troopers was written in 1959, where a new generation of America's leaders were emerging from our pool of WWII heroes.  I think Heinlein's vision was that of a better future where former soldiers would guide our society to a new morality and responsibility.	2001-11-26

Brin's view of the world of 2040 (written in 1990) is so ludicrous, you'd think it was written as an advertisement for Greenpeace.  Basically, in a mere 50 years we have a world where societal norms are turned completely upside down, where ecological disaster is killing and dislocating billions (literally), where &quot;strong, tall Soviets&quot; are taking on refugees by the millions in the newly thawed Siberia and where (as a minor side note actually), someone has lost one or possibly two black holes in the core of the planet.  With the help of a Maori(!) billionaire, the creator of one of the black holes is trying to safe the world, as well as solve the mystery of the second black hole.  Anyway, Brin was trying for the epic here, with lots and lots of disparate groups who we presumably were going to follow as they reacted to the problem at hand.

This is another direct sequel in which we find Flinx rescueing a beautiful gengineer (genetic engineer) who is under assault by eco-terrorists.  The character development in Flinx in Flux is much richer than the other Flinx books, but what really set this one apart (for me) was the dramatic conclusion where Flinx learns of the existence of a great malevelolence, perhaps great enough to destroy the entire universe.

The first in a trilogy with the other two installments due later this year.  Still, the story is cohesive and the writing palatable, which is a lot to say for most science fiction.

Thomas Sowell is one of my favorite conservative authors.  He is also the father of a late talking child who was misdiagnosed with autism or other problems, when in fact there was really nothing wrong with him (other than he talked late).  After writing a few columns about his son, he started to get contacted by many other people with the same situation.  These contacts turned in an informal group - the members of which he writes about here.  There is really not too much in this book for people who do not have family that is late-talking, but for us it was very enlightening (our son Max was late-talking).  The basic conclusion of this book is that there is some unnamed, unstudied disorder which seems to make children who are very very left brained talk late.  These same kids seem to excel at math, logic and computers.  It is possible that the late talking is just a function of the analytical part of the brain talking all the new cells for a while and &quot;robbing&quot; the speech center.  This is not the case will all children who talk late, just thost who are perfectly normal in every other way (can understand and perform other functions normally or at an accelerated rate).	2001-09-26

Flinx, now owner of a space ship, returns to Moth to continue his search for his lineage.  After a few of those events that Flinx always finds himself in the middle of, he ends up with a new pet, a strange alien named Ab.  Flinx, Ab and Pip then head off to another world in search of a man who bid on Flinx when he was a child slave.  That man, Skua September (fresh from the Icerigger trilogy), saves Flinx just in time for his friend Tse-Mallory and Tru to show up in search of Ab (of all things, amazing coincidence).  At any rate, it gets a little far-fetched as Ab eventually saves several populated planets from being sucked into a black hole (of sorts).  Still, this is solid SciFi adventure and worth a read as part of the larger Flinx series.	2001-09-26

Part I of the two part Hand of Thrawn series (really three parts in two books, since Part II is 694 pages).  This book was pretty boring for the first 250 pages or so (out of 386).  I was beginning to wonder why in the heck I was still reading Star Wars novels since they were so bad, but the story finally came around in the last third and I found myself actually wanting to read and find out what happens.  I guess Zahn was just practicing for a while after his long Star Wars drought (he's the one who wrote the first trilogy of follow-ons.)  Anyway, by the last page I was eager to read the second part, so I guess it wasn't so bad after all.	2001-09-26

Halperin fancies himself a futurist and this book is his vision of the future (there's a lot more than just a Truth Machine in it.)  The only thing I liked about this book was the &quot;Swift and Sure&quot; crime bill.  Swift and Sure could also be called &quot;Two strikes and you're executed.&quot;  Very nice.  In the book they rationalize that the codex we currently live by: &quot;better that 10 criminals should go free, rather than one innocent man be punished&quot; does not account for all the innocent people punished (killed, maimed, whatever) by the 10 criminals who went free.  Crime drops precipitously.	2001-09-26

Part II of the two part Hand of Thrawn series.  As I pointed out with my review of the first installment, Zahn finally got his act together near the end of the first book.  The second (and final) part of the series was very good indeed.  I read this 694 pager in just a few days because I was so eager to watch it unwind.  As per all Star Wars novels, multiple threaded stories eventually come together in the end (sort of, in this case.)  At any rate, I don't know if Lucas approved or Zahn just took the initiative, but this one basically ended the Empire as a threat and implied a new, greater and someone more distant threat to face both the Empire and the New Republic.  Tough act to follow, but we'll see what happens.	2001-09-26

Although this book is purportedly about a libertarian revolution, I was so bored by the story and so annoyed by the dialog that I kept wanting to put it down.  Basically, in the language of the &quot;Loonies&quot; (one who lives on the moon), there are quite a few words missing.  They speak like someone might write a telegram.

Since that person liked a lot of other books I liked, I figured I'd give it a look.  What I found was one of the most bizarre futures (600 years hence) imaginable.  I couldn't figure out if Herbert was trying to make a twisted anti-consumerism Brave New World or what, but all of a sudden I realized - this is a ... good story.  The premise, about a \\"garbage comet\\", was really almost incidental to the story and should not be considered a negative.	2001-09-25

Set in England during the 1950s and 1960s, the story follows Jem, known as Solomon Straw, a hangman for England.  Solomon for wisdom and Straw representing the fraility of man.  The novel examines the heart of men, through a very telling story.

This was a very readable book with a fairly decent (true) story and passable writing.  Although it reads more like a really long magazine article, it manages to keep your attention as the real life twists continue page after page.  The book also says a lot about the fishing industry, which is quite interesting (for example, swordfish fisherman use 40 mile lines with 1000 hooks on them, very cool.)  I do wish there was a little more about the actual storm, but this is definately a seaman book, not a weatherman book.	2001-09-25

A stunning recovery for the Star Wars genre.  I had read most of the Star Wars books, which were getting very old and tired.  As noted in my last Star Wars and previous reviews, every story basically had the same old plot.  However, the Empire finally surrendered (in the last one) and Lucas's folks essentially hired R.A. Salvatore to start a new series called \&quot;New Jedi Order\&quot; or NJO.  He did an excellent job.  While the main characters, Luke, Leia, Han haven't changed that much, Han and Leia's children are almost adults and play a much more active role now, there is a new, much more exciting enemy and R.A. even killed a major character.  The first one I can remember since Darth Vader.	2001-09-25

This book brings Han Solo back into the fold (after a 2 book absence) and essentially focuses on him and a Yuuzong Vong infiltration agent.  Not a bad story, but I missed the events surrounding Jedi.  There was practically no use of the force in this book.  As these books develop, I am quite happy to see that this is really just one long series.  Each book, new author or not, takes off exactly where the last one left off.  Since this galactic war is on a huge scale, this could run for at least 10 or more books.  We'll see what happens.	2001-09-25

It wouldn't make much sense to read any of them individually since none is a complete story.  Anyhow, this was kinda two stories in one.  A fairly interesting scifi tale about aliens visiting our solar system.  And then (as a bonus) the other story is about a war with the UN and then later, China.  Together they make for a pretty good story.  I especially liked how Douglas explained the science behind the weapons and technology and described the underlying discovery in the 20th century.  On the downside, I coulda used a little less marine comradery and a little more about the aliens.	2001-09-25

This incredibly well documented book provides a stunning glimpse into the progressive liberal mind. The Orwellian nonsense that passes for &quot;freedom&quot; in America's colleges would probably surprise and shock the general population. I generally expected it, because &quot;increasing freedom by increasing government control&quot; is a mantra you will find with almost every liberal organization in America. Simple logic apparently escapes these people. On the down side, this book is pretty dry and scholarly. The author's definitely did not want to open themselves to criticism, so they went out of their way to overdocument every assertion.	2001-09-25

O'Rourke travels to the world's most miserable places (Bangladesh, Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti). He finds that the people seem relatively happy despite their miserable circumstances and their miserable circumstances are generally brought about by government (big surprise there) or ethnic differences or both.  Since our own government is already responsible for much of our misery and they are certainly trying to highlight and escalate our ethnic differences, there is a good lesson here for anyone who would cast a vote for Al Gore.

Relatively well written book, but I had to put it down about half-way through.  For one thing, the villains seemed way too nice (the author definitely portrayed them that way) and the heroes were somewhat too evil (criminal activity seemed rampant).

Darwin's Radio is a hard science thriller and a real page turner.  The subject matter (how evolution may have ocurred) and the science (DNA, viruses, HERV) would be exciting in themselves, but in this case the science wound up in a first class thriller with lots of political intrigue.  Although it was perhaps a bit too neat at times, most of the story seemed all too real, like it was from tommorrows headlines (I wish).  BTW, although not explicitly stated in this book, there are lot's of problems with Darwin's theory of evolution.  This book presents one possible (fictional) explanation.  None-the-less, if you are walking around with your head in the clouds saying you believe in Evolution (with a capital E), I recommend doing some research into what we now know are serious issues with Darwin's theories.  In principal they are a step in the right direction, but certainly no answer in themselves.	2001-09-25

I was going to write that in some ways this book was most riveting, however, it is mostly just troubling.  Definitely NC-17 and quite perverse.  At any rate, I thought it read a lot like a New Jersey Jew version of Wise Blood, Flannery O'Connor's brilliant story about the futility of trying to elude Jesus.

A very compelling and readable book.  The general premise of this work is that virtue is innate in human nature.  Some fascinating examples from biology lend strong credence to this argument.  How primative societies adapted and grew is explained in terms of human nature (and virtue).  Finally, the simple example of why strong government just doesn't work is applied to what we've learned about human nature.  Fairly short at 265 pages and not too scholarly to be boring.	2001-09-25

Basically in this story, God creates man to understand himself better.  He ends up helping us in various ways, so that man can understand his nature.

The whole book is major battle after major battle, with essentially a galaxy wide war being declared at the end.  If you think about it, a major war is what has really been missing from the Star Wars universe.  The Rebellion against the Emperor could hardly be considered a war.

Despite the apparent rehash of The Forever War, this novel was also very readable. While the villains in this one appear a bit too closely aligned with conservatives and the heroes liberals, the effect was very subtle and did not detract too much from the story.

A very fun story that had me laugh out loud a few times, which I don't do that often, especially reading SciFi.  Definitely a period piece, people who can't appreciate Victorian England should probably avoid this book.  As an old Thomas Hardy fan, I definitely appreciated the setting.  The story was repleat with the silly Victorian maiden, bizarre absent minded professor, somewhat crazed Colonel and dashing hero (and heroine).

What's more, like the later Dune books by Herbert or Xenocide by Card, Simmons gets a little too wrapped up in his world and his world gets a little too weird. The &quot;floating city&quot; and whole Buddhist mountain world bit was as tedious as Card's line tracing. Still, I guess I have to recommend reading the series, the slow spots and odd segments are the price we all have to pay to have another possible vision of the universe, and that's what reading most scifi is about anyway.	2001-09-18

This was much slower that the other 5 books, but after I got used to the pace it was pretty good.  Some important interactions begin to take place between Anakin and the Vong and Anakin can almost feel them in the force now.  One funny note:  I was a bit annoyed at some scenes where the Senate seems content to make deals with the Vong and pretend that they are not bent on capturing the entire galaxy.  What I was annoyed about is that I couldn't conceive of anyone being so stupid as to believe the Vong's lies, frankly I couldn't suspend disbelief enough at the fiction of it.	2001-09-18

Thoughtful.  Much much better.  Hyperion should have been 100 pages at the beginning of this book.  We finally have our AI war, the end of the world and God.  Everything I look for in a sci-fi novel.  The characters that were so boring in Hyperion, really come alive in Fall.  I couldn't put it down for my concern for them.  Perhaps oddest of all, this is a sequel that surpasses the original.  We'll see what the next installment is like.  One word of warning, this book is 517 pages and a tiny font.  This book is probably really about a 700 or 800 page book with a normal font.	2001-09-18
US	48041045	R303VMJNY6JZWT	0345291417	346801982	Nor Crystal Tears	Books	3	8	13	N	N	Good history lesson, bad story	Nor Crystal Tears is a prequel to the extensive Humanx Commonwealth books by Foster. Tears chronicles the first meeting between human and Thranx, as it follows the exploits of an odd Thranx named Ryo. The first half is kinda dull, there is not anything too interesting about the Thranx, actually. The second half, after the humans are introduced (captured really), is marginally better, although a bit inconsistent and far-fetched. Actually, it is pretty easy to believe the alien settings, physiology and even psychology, but the humans were downright unbelievable. A childish (literally) little aside about how wonderful American Indians were and how evil &quot;Cowboys&quot; were, was a bit too much to stomach also.	2001-09-18
US	48041045	R139AJWC55QFCY	0345332857	5527653	Bloodhype	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Don't believe the hype.	As a big fan of Flinx, especially his earnestness, I looked forwarded to following his growth in Foster's second Flinx book.  Sadly, Flinx is less than a minor character in this very confused tale.  Bloodhype is (oddly enough) actually a story about an alien intelligence so powerful it devours all life on planets it attacks and is a threat to the entire galaxy.  Mixed in the story is also some unsavory drug dealers who deal in Bloodhype, a kinda futuristic crack that gets you addicted after one dose and you will die without another.  Still, the last 80 pages or so made it actually worth finishing and possibly made the whole book worth reading.	2001-09-18

New characters. Weird new plotline. The only commonality is the TechnoCore (the villian) and some tenuous links to the past. Oh yea, and like the original Hyperion, really really boring. Endymion did end with a flourish and the last 100 pages or so would make anyone forget the long car ride it took to get there. And like Hyperion, it ended with the promise of something better in the next (and hopefully final) chapter.	2001-09-18

The finale of the Icerigger series does not have quite the adventure of the other two and harbors a pretty silly villain and plot. None-the-less, anyone reading Icerigger and Mission to Moulokin will have to read Deluge Drivers, if only to spend the last few minutes available with our new friends the Tran. There is definitely something wonderful and personal about this series. The characters are very rich and you really want to know more about them and share in their adventures.	2001-09-18

The book is really just 6 tales by 6 strangers on a &quot;pilgrimage&quot; about what led each one of them to Hyperion. I was a bit disappointed that nothing actually happens ON Hyperion, all we find out is why the pilgrims are there, not what happens next (presumably that is in the sequel). Allegedly this book is a &quot;Sci-Fi Canterbury Tales&quot;, but I do not remember much about the Canterbury Tales myself (read them 15 years ago or so). What was most frustrating and the reason I will read the sequel is some interesting hints of an AI &quot;race&quot; that may be done with humans and want to destroy them as well as the mystery of the pilgrimage itself to the &quot;Time Tombs&quot; which are structures travelling backwards through time (which are possibly tied to the AIs, who knows?).	2001-09-18

Finally, after a book and a half of doing virtually nothing, we finally strike back at the Vong and make a dent. I'm sure it escapes most of the younger readers of this series, but there really is a huge study of human nature and war embedded in the NJO series. Where Star Wars was very clean-cut US vs. THEM, NJO presents so many sides to the war, that you have to just try and pick one and stick to it. Personally, I find Anakin to be the most honest with his approach, but then again he has been almost crippled with guilt at times. Anyway, to get back to the story, like most NJO books, this one was a worthwhile read and certainly makes me look forward to the next one.	2001-09-18
US	48041045	R14VRBEXYAWSKX	034530280X	849651954	The Tar-Aiym Krang	Books	4	4	4	N	N	An auspicious beginning	The first of the 7 Flinx of the Commonwealth books.  I don't think the Flinx books are actually an ordered series, rather they are just stories of Flinx and his minidrag Pip (a minidrag is a kind of lethal flying snake).  In The Tar-Aiym Krang we are introduced to Flinx, a mind-reading orphan who lives off of his street act (and a little crime).  Through some believable coincidences, Flinx ends up helping two scientists and a trader as they search for an ancient artifact, the Tar-Aiym Krang.  Although the fact of the Krang is a little bit of an anti-climax, this book is a fine story and is also notable as the introduction of the entire Humanx Commonweath that Foster has returned to over and over.	2001-09-11
