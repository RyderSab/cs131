That being said I was not as thrilled with this book as I wanted to be.  First off it is definitely more a Brady book than a Beaumont.  I was almost half way through the book before Beaumont was introduced.  This was not why I didn't like it, but was a minor disappointment.  I felt this book went along smoothly, and then just seemed to fall apart at the end.  It wasn't nearly as suspenseful as her books usually are, and I thought the ending had a lot of loose ends.  But most of all I really disliked the focus on Beaumont's ex-wife Anne, coupled with the sexual attraction that seems to pop up out of no where.  That seemed like something Jance threw in as an after thought and it really didn't seem to fit.  Overall I would recommend this book to someone who is an avid Jance reader, but wouldn't want someone new to try this book first!	2004-08-16

I really enjoyed this book, and have not read one this good in a long time.  Barbara Kingsolver definately weaves her ecological opinions into her stories, but I believe they fit right along with the stories.  This book was so good, it actually made me want to move to West Virginia and live on a farm!  And I am a total city girl!<br />I highly recommend it.	2004-07-19

Then I just put it down.  Which is something I rarely ever do.  The writting style was so drab I just couldn't get into the book.  But I will say I do plan on trying to read it again.  If for no other reason than I am curious as to what the hell happened to that priest!  I gave it three stars, because it did leave me interested in trying again, plus I can't give it an accurate rating since I didn't finish it.  <br />My recommendation would be pick it up used if you are interested...	2004-06-15

I picked it up having no idea what it was about and could not put it down.  It is so intense from the first page to the last.  The plot is great, it grabs your attention right away.  I highly recommend this book.  I think I could probably say this is the best mystery/thriller I've ever read!	2004-06-07

I don't know how she knew, but I didn't know until the very end!  This was a good book and a fast pace read.  I'm not usually a big mystery reader, but I really like Jance's style and most of all I like J.P. Beaumont.  He is a great main character.	2004-01-05

I had heard people talk of it forever and always put it in my mind as a book to read, but I didn't think that it would necessarily be an enjoyable read.  I finally got around to reading it when I heard that Michael Moore's new movie is titled after this book.  (Fahrenheit 9/11 The Temperature at Which Freedom Burns)<BR>So about the book...  It is not only a good story with a strong message regarding freedom of speech.  It is beautifully written and very easy to read.  The words flow, and each character is perfect in their contribution to the story.  This book is pretty short.  I think it is a must read for anyone.  I'm not going to say more, because you have to read it for yourself!	2003-10-02

Somehow I didn't even have to pause over the fact that the message in this story is being told by a gorilla.  <BR>I've taken a couple anthropology classes, so the question of &quot;how things came to be this way&quot; has come up many times.  I think Daniel Quinn gives some interesting answers.  Some of them I've heard before, and some I never thought of in the way he put it.  I think this is a very important book.  It not only tells how to make this world a better place it inspired an entire Pearl Jam album(Yield)! Listen to their song Do The Evolution and you'll get it.	2003-10-02

I am a pretty big fan of his, but I didn't think this book compared to his others.  It wasn't a terrible book, and I don't regret reading it.

It really opened my eyes to the domainating power that these large corporations have over the world. My only complaint about this book, is it could be a little long winded at times. It held my attention, but it is just so long! It felt like I was holding a text book in my lap! Over all I recommend it. It is packed full of lots of information that is all backed up by facts. My favorite part of the book is how it all seems to tie in with the WTO and NAFTA. If you are interested in learning why so many people are against these organizations this is a good book to start with.	2002-10-15

Anne is a wonderful story teller.  But, I think that it is time to get back to the Lestat story line.  Although I liked this book, it was not as good as some of the previous vampire chronicles.  I would recommend this to Anne Rice fan's only because I love the vampire chronicles so much.  But this book falls short of being one of Anne's best. I felt that it moved extremely slow.  If you read the previous books in the chronicle you already knew a lot of the events that take place.  <BR>Over all I would have preferred to have another one of Lestat's adventures, then listen to Marius drone on and on.	2002-07-19

It is a must have whether you are a die hard Dean Koontz fan or not.  It was typical Dean Koontz style in that the suspense never stopped and each page left you constantly wanting more!  This book is twenty times better than the movie!  So don't let the movie pursuade you from reading the book.	2002-07-19

The Cider House Rules and A Prayer For Owen Meany are my two most favorite books of all time.  I was very dissapointed with this book to say the least.  I'm not sure how to fully explain my thoughts on the book.  It seemed like just when I was starting to like the story or a character something would and I wouldn't like the character or the direction of the story.  I tried very hard to like it while I was reading it and it never happened.  I agree with what on reader said about it lacking warmth.  None of the characters seem to have any passion behind anything that they do.  It seems like they move on sick compulsions.	2001-09-03

From the moment I started it I could not put it down.  It is my least favorite out of the series, but it is still an excellent book.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes western fiction or fantasy.  Roland is like a lone cowboy, but the world around him is full of fantasy.  It only gets better when we are introduced to new characters in the next books.	2001-09-03

There were a lot of characters that I loved to hate.  I had a hard time liking anybody in this story.  It was very sad and disturbing.  I didn't get any insight from it and apperently I was suppose to.  I don't think I would recommend this to anyone.  I will say one good thing about it aside from not liking the story very much or the characters it was written very well and had a lot of imagination.	2001-09-03

This book is terrible. It was written by John Brandon based on interviews with Alice In Chain's ex bassist Mike Starr.  Mike quit AIC around 1992.  This book repeats its self over and over again. Mike is constantly telling us how much women like him.<BR>This book is so blantantly biased I don't know how they could expect anyone to take him serious!<BR>When they weren't referring to how much of a lady's man Mike was they talk about how jealous Jerry Cantrell (guitarist) was of Mike. For some reason I have a really hard time buying that one. There were obviously other things going on if Mike quits one day and then changes his mind that next and they don't let him back. I don't think it was Jerry's jealousy either. Mike also claimed that Jerry wanted to kick Layne out of the band.  This is absolutely ridiculous. It has always been apparent that Jerry and Layne were close at least at one time and had respect for each other.<BR>I am glad that I read this book only because I am a huge AIC fan and I would read about any book about them. If you read this book just take everything Mike says with a grain of salt. <BR>The worst part of the book is when Mike admits he hasn't talked to the any of the band members in years, yet continues to comment on their wellbeing. I have a hard time believing that Jerry is a crackhead when he has been on tour supporting his album and is going to release a double disc cd. So Mike lies blantantly right there. In his book his dad says that no record company will drop a dime on Jerry because he is so messed up.  I live in Seattle and I have actually seen Jerry around town on 3 different occasions and not once did he appear to be on crack or extremley messed up on any drug.  If he was as messed up with drugs as Mike says he is I think you would be able to tell by looking at him. I think it is quite obvious that he had this book written because he was hoping to make a few bucks off of his time with AIC.	2001-09-01

This story gave me some insight on the characters that I was familiar with, but it made me think less of them then I had before.
