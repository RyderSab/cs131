There are some instances regarding sleep remedies but the authors warn that for medical advice and treatment, you should consult the appropriate medical person.  However, for those with sleep problems, part four of this book should be most helpful since it offers practical advice.<br /><br />This book ends with three appendices that I feel are excellent.  The third appendix is especially good since it lists ten important internet sites.<br /><br />There's only one major problem with this book: it's way too long.  It is too long because Dement wants to tell his biography at the same time and give anecdotal stories.  The result is that the reader has to read through all this detail before encountering a point of importance.  This problem gets worse as one proceeds through the book.  Summary pages of key points at the end of each chapter would have been most helpful.<br /><br />However, this problem does not make the book unworthy of reading since the information conveyed is important.  Impatient readers will probably disagree with me though.<br /><br />Finally, I should WARN prospective buyers of this book that it is only the paperback version that has an index.  An index, especially for this long book, is important because it allows one to access important information quickly.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good book that \\"explores the vital connection between health, happiness, and a good night's sleep.\\"  If you want to understand this important part of your life, then this is the book to get!!<br /><br />(first published 1999;  acknowledgements; introduction;  4 parts or 20 chapters; main narrative 450 pages;  afterword;  3 appendices; index for paperback version only)<br /><br />+++++<br />This book, I feel, is strongest at conveying how to understand sleep.

They are found in the brief last chapter of this book by the late Dr. David Viscott, a well-known psychiatrist.  There are 8 more of these don'ts.  As well, there are 14 truths that you should do to heal and change your life.  (This makes for a total of 27 \\"Dos and Don'ts.\\")<br /><br />This book is a kind of handbook to successfully get through the emotional bumps of life that everybody encounters.  Viscott explains more eloquently:<br /><br />\\"This book is designed to help you achieve and preserve your emotional resilience, so you can face the difficult threats of the present and manage them effectively without being drained, feeling bad about yourself, or second-guessing your actions.\\"<br /><br />This book centers around three main concepts:<br /><br />(1) Natural Therapy: refers to the spontaneous process (that this book advocates) that enables healing and change to occur.<br /><br />(2) Emotional Debt: the condition of withholding feelings.  This works on the principle that when feelings are not expressed, a condition of tension is created.  Thus, emotional stress is the pressure of unexpressed feelings.  What you want to strive for is to limit emotional debt.<br /><br />(3) Toxic Nostalgia: the intrusion of past feelings into the present that bring up fear, anger, or hurt.  These past feelings are stored in emotional debt.<br /><br />Finally, this is a surprisingly easy book to read.  There is no tedious psychobabble to contend with and you will begin learning right away.<br /><br />In conclusion, read this book and resolve what's bothering you and getting in the way of your sense of freedom and happiness right now!!<br /><br />(first published 1996;  acknowledgments;  introduction;  14 chapters; main narrative 355 pages;  index)<br /><br />+++++ss right now!!<br /><br />(first published 1996;  acknowledgments;  introduction;  14 chapters; main narrative 355 pages;  index)<br /><br />+++++	2005-10-05

Totalitarianism is a characteristic of a government or state in which one political party maintains complete control under a dictatorship and bans all others.<br /><br />This story, which takes place in London in 1984, follows one man (named Winston Smith) and his love interest (Julia) as they struggle against this totalitarian party (\\"The Party\\") whose leader (actually dictator) is \\"Big Brother.\\"  The Party political orthodoxy rules the giant country of \\"Oceania\\" (in which London is located).<br /><br />At the heart of this party's political orthodoxy is the process of controlling thought through the manipulation of language and information by the use of \\"Newspeak\\" which utilizes what is called \\"doublethink.\\"<br /><br />Newspeak is the official language of Oceania (but is not the only language spoken).  It is a language that eliminates unnecessary words and is designed to diminish rather than help expressive thought.  For example, Newspeak states that there is no good and bad but only good and \\"ungood.\\"  Doublethink is the ability to simultaneously hold two opposing ideas in ones mind and believe in them both.  The three Party slogans that title this review are examples of doublethink.  Another good example is that (2+ 2 =4) and (2 + 2 = 5).<br /><br />The Party keeps everybody in line through Newspeak and doublethink.  But they also have other methods.  For example, they have the \\"Thought Police\\" that investigate \\"thoughtcrimes.\\"  These are \\"crimes\\" of just having negative thoughts about The Party.  Another example are telescreens that watch your every move even in bathroom stalls.  Thus, \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" at all times.<br /><br />Winston and Julia are discovered to be guilty of thoughtcrimes by O'Brien (who is the personification of The Party).  O'Brien also represents those leaders who use cruelty and torture as their primary method of control (like Hitler and Stalin did).  He makes them pay for their \\"crimes.\\"<br /><br />This novel clearly shows how totalitarianism negatively affects the human spirit and how it's impossible to remain freethinking under such circumstances.<br /><br />This novel also contains an appendix written by Orwell.  Here he explains various aspects of Newspeak and to my surprise he states that by the year 2050, Newspeak will be the only language that anyone will understand.  Why does he state this?  He wanted to keep the fear of totalitarianism alive in his readers well past the year 1984.  (Thus, this novel is still quite relevant for today!)<br /><br />Finally, this novel in a word is fascinating!  It is well written and is filled with symbolism and imagination.  It begins slow but gradually picks up speed.  And the story is very interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, this novel is a masterpiece of political speculation that serves as a warning to us all.

They were compiled and edited by Al Seckel, a member of the Bertrand Russell Society and one who has lectured extensively on Russell's life and work.  According to Seckel, \\"the purpose of this collection is to bring together in one...volume some of Russell's most delightful thought-provoking essays on [organized] religion.\\"<br /><br />Some topics discussed are agnosticism, atheism, rationalism, churches, God, the soul, science, free thought, sin, and faith.  He examines these and other topics with \\"rational skepticism\\" which is \\"withholding judgment where the evidence is not sufficient, or, even more so, when there is contrary evidence.\\"<br /><br />This collection of essays definitely captures the scope and depth of Russell's thinking on religion.  His logic and reasoning are impeccable.  I now understand why he was called \\"the world's most famous atheist.\\"<br /><br />The book is divided into five parts.  Here are the titles of my favorite essays taken from each part:<br /><br />I. (6 essays)<br /><br />(1) Why I am not a Christian.<br />(2) The faith of a rationalist.  (No supernatural reasons are needed to make humans kind.)<br /><br />II. (5 essays)<br /><br />(1) A debate on the existence of God. (Between Russell and a Father of the church.)<br /><br />III.  (2 essays)<br /><br />(1) Science and religion.<br /><br />IV.  (6 essays)<br /><br />(1) An outline of intellectual rubbish.<br />(2) The value of free thought.  (How to become a truth-seeker and break the chains of mental slavery.)<br />(3) Ideas that have harmed mankind (and womankind).<br />(4) Ideas that have helped mankind  (and womankind).<br /><br />V.  (2 essays)<br /><br />(1) The theologian's nightmare.<br /><br />Before the first essay begins, there is a brief biography of Bertrand Russell (later Lord Russell) by Seckel.  It is very thorough as evidenced by the more than 55 footnotes at its end.<br /><br />Finally, the only problem I had with this book is with regard to referencing.  All essays are not referenced or inadequately referenced.  I know that Russell in his other works extensively referenced.  Thus, I'm not sure if Seckel edited out references to save space and assumed that the reader would believe everything Russell said due to his reputation.  On a subject like this, I think references should have been kept in.  Also, there is a bibliography at the end of the book.  But it is really just a list of books written by Russell.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fascinating collection of essays by one of most prolific and brilliant thinkers and writers of the twentieth century.  Now I understand why Russell won the 1950 Nobel Prize in literature!!<br /><br />**** 1/2<br /><br />(essay collection published 1986;  acknowledgements;  biography of Bertrand Russell;  5 parts or 21 chapters;  main narrative 300 pages;  \\"bibliography;\\"  name index;  subject index)<br /><br />+++++footnotes at its end.<br /><br />Finally, the only problem I had with this book is with regard to referencing.

It is also meant for concerned Americans as well as any concerned, rational member of the world community.<br /><br />In this book you will find, among other things, the names of various Canadian politicians but as well the names of various American politicians.  Also there are names of people in the American military as well as the names of concerned scientists.<br /><br />This book is extremely well documented.  (There are footnotes on almost every page.)  Hurtig's main narrative consists of mainly quotations from politicians, scientists, and military people but it also has extensive quotations from authors, journalists, and commentators.<br /><br />There are 18 chapters.  What I will do is state the title of each chapter first.  A few chapter titles catch the essence of a chapter's contents but if a title does not, I elaborate with my own description or quote from the chapter.<br /><br />(1) An Assault On Humanity.  Describes the destruction and effects on humans that resulted from the dropping of the nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.  ***This is clearly the most descriptive and heart-wrenching chapter.<br /><br />(2) History's Worst Possible Nightmare.  The nightmare: a nuclear war.  Hurtig explains why.<br /><br />(3) Making Us And The World Less Secure.  (\\"Us\\" refers to Canada and the World.)  \\"Deployment of the national missile defense system will likely tear up the fabric of arms control agreements which have improved global security for over thirty years.\\"<br /><br />(4) Secret, Confidential, And Canadian Eyes Only.  Documents Hurtig obtained make it quite clear \\"that [Canada's] Department of Defense has made up its mind and strongly favors Canadian participation in the American Ballistic Missile Defense plans.\\"<br /><br />(5) Let's Not Have Too Many Meeting.  \\"The present [Ballistic Missile Plan] has nothing to do with the weaponizing of space.\\"  Hurtig has uncovered evidence that this is false.<br /><br />(6) Don't Even Think About Thinking About It.  That is, Canada should not even think about not joining in on the U.S. missile program because there would be dire consequences.  Is this really true?<br /><br />(7) How Could We Possibly Go Along [with the U.S. missile defense program]?  (\\"We\\" refers to Canada.)  Hurtig answers this question.<br /><br />(8) A Pandemic Of Insecurity:  Escalation, Destabilization, Proliferation.  \\"At the UN conference on the Non-Proliferation Treaty, there was broad condemnation of the [U.S.] Ballistic Missile Defense [plan] on the grounds that it would undermine decades of arms control agreements and provoke a new weapons race.\\"<br /><br />(9) Shield Of Dreams: Why The American National Missile Defense Won't Work.<br /><br />(10) A Nuclear Arsenal In Space: Approving What We Have Always Opposed.  \\"It is not credible for Canada to seek involvement and claim that such involvement does not imply support for the space-based [and nuclear weapon] elements that it knows Washington is actively pursuing.\\"  ***This is a most important chapter.<br /><br />(11) The Busboy At The Conveyer Belt Inside The Tent.  \\"Clearly this [the U.S. missile defense program] is an escalation of the arms race.  This is a lunacy program.  It cannot be justified from a defense point of view, or from an economic point of view.\\"<br /><br />(12) Rushing Into A Gigantic Boondoggle, And The REAL Threat. \\"The extraordinary emphasis on missile defense represents misplaced priorities.  The top priority should instead be combating the threat of nuclear terrorism\\"  (Union of Concerned Scientists).<br /><br />(13) The Rogue Nation: No Longer Trusted...It Should Be Feared.  This chapter examines how the U.S. is a rogue nation with respect to nuclear weapons.<br /><br />(14) The Foolish And Arrogant Bush Doctrine.  This chapter examines George W. Bush's ultimatum: \\"Either you're with us or you're against us...Over time its going to be important for nations to know they will be held accountable for inactivity [with regard to U.S. defense, military, and foreign policies].\\"<br /><br />(15) National Mythological Defense: Profits and Greed Lining The Pockets Of Defense Contractors.<br /><br />(16) The Wrong-Headed Priorities Of Government Are Stunning And Intolerable.  (\\"Government\\" refers to that of the U.S.)  \\"I want to know why there is always so much money for war and so little for the human condition.\\"<br /><br />(17) The Sword Of Damocles: Doesn't Canada Have To Choose Which Side We're On?  (The story of Damocles is a Greek fable where, despite having everything, there is a sword over his head hung by a single horsehair that could fall at any moment.)<br /><br />(18) Moving By Stealth To Co-operate In Our Own Ghastly Annihilation.  (\\"Our\\" refers to Canada and the World.)<br /><br />There are also three VERY informative appendices.  The last one is entitled, \\"Rogue States, Terrorists, an Accident Waiting to Happen, and Why Destroying All Nuclear Weapons MUST BE the Only answer.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the only minor problem I had with this book is that its chapter titles in the table of contents and the chapters themselves are not numbered (as they are above).  This book would have been more reader-friendly if these were numbered.  (Interestingly, each appendix is numbered.)<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fascinating and honest book that presents the facts regarding nuclear weaponization of space and what this means for the world.

(An allegory is a story in which people, things, and happenings have a hidden or symbolic meaning.)  When it was first published, it made Orwell famous overnight.<br /><br />It tells the fable of a group of barnyard animals who revolt against their harsh human master, causing him to flee.  The animals establish a system of socialism.  (Socialism is a political and economic philosophy that states that only when the state controls the means of production and distribution will its members share its profits and rewards.)  However, things go wrong and go full circle as the animals soon find themselves subjected to an even worse tyranny instigated by their own kind.<br /><br />For those who know about the Russian (or Bolshevik) revolution of 1917, it is also a satire on Stalinism.  (Josef Stalin soon was ruling Russia after the revolution as a totalitarian or absolute dictator.)  Many of the animal characters in the novel parallel those of the Russian revolution.  The farm itself is a model of Russia at this time.<br /><br />There are countless themes that run throughout this novel.  Major ones include the role of the population, religion and tyranny, and false allegiance.<br /><br />Finally, Orwell's spare prose and the logic of this dark comedy illuminate the stark message he coveys to the reader.  The book is very easy to read and even children will enjoy reading it.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a brilliant novel that lays out a vision that gives us a clear understanding of the possible consequences of our social and political acts!!<br /><br />(novel first published 1945;  10 chapters;  main narrative 95 pages)<br /><br />+++++	2005-08-15

As for the science part, Crick elaborates:<br /><br />\\"I have written [this book] both for my fellow scientists and for the general public [and] believe a [non-scientist] can easily understand most of what I discuss...My advice to the reader, should he or she become stuck in...a [difficult, scientific] passage, is either to persevere or to skip to the next chapter.  Most of the book is fairly easy.  Don't give up hope just because a few paragraphs seem a little hard to follow.\\"<br /><br />What, then, is the purpose of this book?  Crick tells the reader:<br /><br />\\"The main purpose of this book is to set out some of my experiences before and during the classical period of molecular biology, which stretched from the discovery of the DNA double helix in 1953 till about 1966 when the genetic code...was finally elucidated.\\"<br /><br />(Molecular biology is a branch of biology that studies the chemical and physical principles associated with the composition, properties, and activities of molecules in living cells.  The genetic code is the dictionary relating the nucleic acid {such as DNA and RNA} language to the protein language.)<br /><br />Crick achieves his purpose admirably!  He gives us an overview of his main, personal experiences and reveals his thoughts at each period in his life.  I especially enjoyed his chapter entitled \\"The Gossip Test\\" and his memories about the \\"RNA Tie Club.\\"<br /><br />I found the science part especially well done.  He explains the science that led up to the discovery of DNA's structure but goes beyond this, explaining such things as the different types of RNA, protein structure, the genetic code, and theory in molecular biology.  Everything is well explained and there are many helpful diagrams.<br /><br />Be aware that Crick decided not to give character sketches of his friends and colleagues especially James Watson (born: 1928), Maurice Wilkins (1916 to 2004), Rosalind Franklin (1920 to 1958) and Linus Pauling (1901 to 1994).  In other words, he chose not to include \\"juicy\\" gossip in his book.  I found this refreshing since I found that in reading other books similar to this one that such character sketches can be distracting to the main essence of the book.<br /><br />This book does not conclude in the year 1966 since Crick includes a final, long epilogue chapter entitled \\"My Later Years.\\"  This chapter is especially interesting as we are told how he moved on to the field of embryology or developmental biology to become involved generally in human brain science and more specifically in human consciousness.  I found his theory of \\"panspermia\\" (that \\"is the idea that microorganisms drifted to the Earth through space and seeded all life on Earth\\") most interesting.<br /><br />This book has two excellent appendices that resemble a small course in basic genetics.  I found these to be well written.<br /><br />Included near the middle of the book are over twenty black and white photographs.  My favorite is Crick with Wilkins and Watson (as well as famous others like John Steinbeck) at the 1962 Nobel Prize Ceremony.<br /><br />Finally, my only problem occurs on the inside back flap of the book's dust cover.  It says the Crick \\"shared a Nobel Prize with...Watson and...Wilkins in 1962 for the discovery of the double helix of DNA.\\"  Not true!  According to the official Nobel Prize internet site, they shared the prize \\"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structures of nucleic acid and its significance for information transfer in living material.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want to know about the life and brilliant intellect of a \\"genius of modern science,\\" then you have to read this book!!<br /><br />(first published 1988;  acknowledgements;  introduction;  14 chapters;  photo inserts;  main narrative 165 pages;  2 appendices;  index)<br /><br />+++++Watson (born: 1928), Maurice Wilkins (1916 to 2004), Rosalind Franklin (1920 to 1958) and Linus Pauling (1901 to 1994).

Here it is!!!!!	+++++<br /><br />The essence of this science fiction novel, by Philip K. Dick, is about bounty hunter Rick Deckard finding and \\"retiring\\" several sophisticated rogue androids or \\"andys\\" that look and act like humans.  His assignment is not that simple.  Why?  Because these androids don't want to be found.  As the story proceeds, Deckard develops a relationship with an even more sophisticated android.<br /><br />This is just the \\"essence\\" of this novel.  It is really a philosophical, introspective story and as a result action is kept to a minimum.  This story deals with a wide range of themes, the main one being: what does it mean to be human?  As well, there are twists and turns along the way that kept me interested and surprised.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the actual writing fantastic.  Dick thoroughly convinced me that his story was taking place in the year 2021.  He superbly creates a portrait of the Earth devastated by a nuclear war and how humans cope in this now new world.  The science and science fiction were also well presented as were characterization and dialogue.<br /><br />Here is an example of Dick's writing where he describes the more sophisticated android, Rachael:<br /><br />\\"Rachael's proportions...were odd; with her heavy mass of dark hair her head seemed large, and because of her diminutive breasts her body assumed a lank, almost childlike stance.  But her great eyes, with their elaborate lashes, could only be those of a grown woman; there the resemblance to adolescence ended.  Rachael rested very slightly on the forepart of her feet, and her arms, as they hung, bent at the joint: the stance, he [Deckard] reflected of, a wary hunter of perhaps the Cro-Magnon persuasion.  The race of tall hunters, he [Deckard] said to himself.  No excess flesh, a flat belly, small behind, and smaller bosom-Rachael had been modeled on the Celtic type of build, anachronistic and attractive.  Below [her] brief shorts her legs, slender, had a neutral, nonsexual quality, not much rounded off in nubile curves.  The total impression was good, however.  Although definitely that of a girl, not a woman.  Except for the restless, shrewd eyes.\\"<br /><br />This novel is also sold under the title of \\"Blade Runner\\" because the 1982 movie of the same name was based on this novel.  I definitely agree with the publisher when he/she says:<br /><br />\\"Though the novel's characters and backgrounds differ in some respects from those of the [movie], readers who enjoy the latter will discover an added dimension on encountering the original work.\\"<br /><br />This was what happened to me.  I saw many years ago the original, theatrical movie first, read this novel, then saw the original movie again.  From my experience, reading the novel does add another dimension to the movie.  (Note that the movie is the original, theatrical release, not the cut up and, in my opinion, bad \\"Director's Cut.\\")  Be aware that Deckard in the movie is called a \\"Blade Runner\\" but in the novel he is only referred to as a bounty hunter.  As well, in the movie the androids are called \\"Replicants\\" but in the novel they are only called androids.<br /><br />Thus, I am puzzled when some of the other reviewers say that this novel and the movie are totally different.  Did they actually read this novel?<br /><br />Finally, the only problem I had with this novel is that occasionally the author goes into talking about things that I had a difficult time following.  This was sometimes frustrating.  But, like I said, this only occurs occasionally and so I was able to tolerate this.  Also, some readers may find that the androids were not as ferocious and cunning as they were in the movie.

Huxley explains:<br /><br />\\"When [my science fiction novel] `Brave New World' [1932] was being written, I was convinced that there was plenty of time.  The completely organized society, the...caste [or class] system, the abolition of free will by methodical conditioning, the servitude made acceptable by regular doses of chemically induced happiness, the orthodoxies drummed in by...sleep-teaching--these [threats to individual freedom] were coming all right, but not in my time...I feel a good deal less optimistic than I did when I was writing [my science fiction novel].  The prophecies made in [my science fiction novel] are coming true much sooner than I thought they would...Impersonal forces over which we have almost no control seem to be pushing us all in the direction of the Brave New Worldian nightmare...impersonal forces which are now making the world so extremely unsafe for democracy [and] individual freedom.\\"<br /><br />This is what this book does.  It looks in depth at the above threats or forces to or \\"enemies of\\" individual freedom and others mentioned in Huxley's science fiction novel and applies them to the modern world.  The author examines in depth the following six threats or forces:<br /><br />(1) overpopulation<br /><br />(2) over-organization (or bureaucracy)<br /><br />(3) propaganda (in a democratic society and under a dictatorship)<br /><br />(4) brainwashing<br /><br />(5) persuasion (chemical and subconscious or subliminal)<br /><br />(6) hypnopaedia (sleep-teaching)<br /><br />His analysis made over a quarter century ago (from the year of this review) is amazingly accurate.  I'll give one perfect example:<br /><br />\\"Our contemporary Western society, in spite of its material, intellectual, and material progress, is increasingly less conducive to mental health, and tends to undermine the inner security, happiness, reason, and the capacity for love in the individual; it tends to turn him into an automaton who pays for his human failure with increasing mental sickness, and with despair hidden under a frantic drive for work and so-called pleasure...Man [and woman are] not made to be an automaton, and if he [or she] becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed...People are related to one another, not as total personalities but as embodiments of economic functions or, when they are not at work, as irresponsible seekers of entertainment.\\"<br /><br />The above example is the kind of insight you'll find throughout this well-written book.  There are a few (very few!) times Huxley seems to be wrong, but the majority of time he is spot-on.<br /><br />In the last chapter of his book, Huxley attempts amongst other things to answer the following question:<br /><br />\\"How can we control the vast impersonal forces that now menace our hard-one freedoms?\\"  He does a good job coming to grips with this difficult question.<br /><br />Do you have to read Huxley's previous science fiction novel to understand this book?  NO.  When he refers to his science fiction novel in this book he does not make any assumptions that the reader has read his science fiction novel.  However, as a person who has read his previous novel, I can say that this book had more impact on me than if I had not read the previous novel.<br /><br />Finally, the only problem I had with this non-fiction book is that it has no references and footnotes (or notes).  Huxley to be sure uses information and statistics from other sources but no credit is given to them.  Huxley, in his main narrative, does sometimes give informal credit to his sources but many times, he does not even do this.  All information sources should have been properly referenced.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an insightful, prophetic, fascinating bookthat makes the case that our society may be heading in the wrong direction due to forces attempting to take away our individual freedoms!<br /><br />(first published 1958;  forward by author; 12 chapters;  main narrative 185 pages)<br /><br />+++++that makes the case that our society may be heading in the wrong direction due to forces attempting to take away our individual freedoms!<br /><br />(first published 1958;  forward by author; 12 chapters;  main narrative 185 pages)<br /><br />+++++	2005-07-29

Maxwell is an easy-to-read, small book that states that ethics is not complicated.  Maxwell explains:<br /><br />\\"Ethics is ethics.  If you desire to be ethical, you live by one standard across the board...Educators, philosophers, theologians, and lawyers have taken what is a simple matter and made it very confusing...This book's goal is to help you find the way to live and work ethically and also achieve greater success.\\"<br /><br />The one \\"standard\\" Maxwell recommends using in all situations is the Golden Rule: the precept that one should  behave toward others as one would want others to behave toward oneself.<br /><br />Maxwell does a good job in explaining why the Golden Rule is the standard to be used in all situations.  However, the only situation he uses in his numerous, true, effective example stories is the type (RIGHT versus WRONG).  For example, a cashier gives you too much change.  The WRONG thing to do is to keep the extra change.  The RIGHT thing to do is thus to give the extra change back.<br /><br />The author gives many quotations from prominent people to get his points across.  One of my favorites is a quotation from Ted Koppel:<br /><br />\\"There's harmony and inner peace to be found in following a moral compass [he's referring to the Golden Rule] that points in the same direction regardless of fashion or trend.\\"<br /><br />Maxwell touches on the fact that all people are not the same and that the rule may have to be slightly altered to accommodate them.<br /><br />A feature of this book is that certain important summary points are taken out of the main narrative and bordered between two horizontal lines for easy reference.  I counted almost forty of these peppered throughout the book.  Here are two examples:<br /><br />(1)  \\"There are really two important points when it comes to ethics.  The first is a standard to follow.  The second is the will to follow it.\\"<br /><br />(2)  \\"Every day, whenever the issue of ethical behavior confronts you, ask this question: `How would I like to be treated in this situation?'\\"<br /><br />As mentioned, Maxwell effectively explains the use of the Golden Rule in (RIGHT versus WRONG) situations.  However, he does not explain how to use the rule in (RIGHT versus RIGHT) situations.  This is called the ethical dilemma.  To be fair, Maxwell does mention the ethical dilemma but his explanation of it is rather simplistic.<br /><br />Here is an example of a dilemma.  You are asked in your high-paying job to do something you feel is not right or else be fired.  (It took years of hard work to get the high pay you're now getting.)  The RIGHT thing to do according to the golden rule is to quit your job and get another lower paying one.  However, there are ill members of your family who depend on your high income.  So the RIGHT thing to do is not to quit your job.  Maxwell spends no time in explaining such situations.<br /><br />Despite not explaining how to handle dilemma situations, I still feel that this is a useful book that takes the technical jargon out of understanding ethics.  Maxwell gives numerous true cases that prove how the Golden Rule builds morale, increases productivity, encourages teamwork, lowers employee turnover, and keeps clients coming back.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an effective book that explains some major ethical concepts.  It demonstrates how doing the right thing is the best way to live and fosters a winning situation for all!!<br /><br />(first published 2003;  acknowledgements;  preface;  7 chapters;  conclusion;  main narrative 105 pages;  notes)<br /><br />+++++The second is the will to follow it.\\"<br /><br />(2)  \\"Every day, whenever the issue of ethical behavior confronts you, ask this question: `How would I like to be treated in this situation?'\\"<br /><br />As mentioned, Maxwell effectively explains the use of the Golden Rule in (RIGHT versus WRONG) situations.

It is a compilation of selected previously published articles (some of them revised) that he wrote for the publication \\"Parade\\" (which is one of the most widely circulated publications in the United States).<br /><br />This book is foremost an expression of Sagan's \\"thoughts\\" (a word in the book's subtitle).  What he does is express his thoughts on various social, political, religious, and scientific issues.<br /><br />These selected articles are divided into three parts that make up nineteen chapters.  The epilogue makes up the fourth part.  Below I shall state the \\"nuclei\\" of each chapter or article (as I see it) and give for selected articles a sample thought in quotation marks.<br /><br />(I)  (6 chapters)<br /><br />(1) The meaning of big numbers and their importance when dealing with complex issues.<br />(2) Exponentials and their relation to complex issues.<br />(3) The human hunting instinct, a remnant from our past.<br />\\"[I]f we're stranded a few hundred centuries from when we long to be--if...we find ourselves, in an age of environmental pollution, social hierarchy, economic inequality, nuclear weapons...with [ancient] emotions but without [ancient] social safeguards--perhaps we can be excused for [liking rough,  contact sports] like...football.\\"<br />(4) The physics of waves, sound waves & human communication, and light waves & human sight.<br />\\"[T]he elegant machinery of the evolutionary process...has brought us into ...superb harmony with our physical environment.\\"<br />(5) Four cosmic questions.  Sagan explains the details behind these questions that are as follows:<br /> (i) Was there ever life on Mars? (ii) Is Titan a laboratory for the origin of life?

US	45789111	RYGEI7S76PO0I	047086088X	380135136	The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell	Books	5	66	74	N	N	The man who bridged the gap between Newton and Einstein!!!	+++++<br /><br /> Who wrote these poetic lines?<br /><br />\\"Trust me spring is very near,<br />All the buds are swelling;<br />All the glory of the year<br />In those buds is dwelling.\\"<br /><br />The obvious answer is some famous poet.  Right?  Wrong! These are the lines in a poem written by a forgotten icon in science named James Clerk Maxwell (1831 to 1879).  Learning that this great scientist was also a poet is just one of the facts you'll find in this extremely well organized, well-written, easy-to-read book authored by former engineer Basil Mahon.<br /><br />Even before plunging into the main narrative, I was impressed with the material beforehand.<br /><br />Take the table of contents.  At a glance, I can tell you what happened anytime in Maxwell's life.  For example, what happened between 1856 and 1860.  I just have to glance at the table of contents.  For chapter 6, it has the title \\"Saturn and Statistics: Aberdeen 1856-1860.\\"  (Saturn is the sixth planet in our solar system.)<br /><br />There is also a \\"chronology\\" that lists the \\"principle events in Maxwell's life.\\"  For instance, what significant event occurred in 1858?  Answer at a glance: Maxwell was awarded the Adams' Prize for his essay \\"On the Stability of the Motion of Saturn's Rings.\\"<br /><br /> As well, there is a \\"cast of characters.\\"  That is, a summary outline of \\"Maxwell's relations and close friends\\" found throughout the book.  For example, who was William Thompson (later Baron Kelvin)?  Answer at a glance:  He was a friend (and mentor of the early stages of Maxwell's career) and Professor of Natural Philosophy at Glasgow University.<br /><br />In his main narrative, Mahon tells us everything about Maxwell beginning with his early years and ending with his early death.  We learn about his world-shaking scientific discoveries as well as about the man himself.  With regards to this entire book, the publication \\"Nature\\" said it best:<br /><br /> \\"not merely an absorbing account of Maxwell's life [but] an explanation of why his work is at the foundation of the modern world.\\"<br /><br />Mahon's main narrative shines with his last two chapters entitled \\"Last days\\" and \\"Maxwell's legacy\\" respectively.<br /><br /> In the former case, we learn the actual words of a doctor treating him for his medical condition: \\"No man ever met death more consciously or more calmly.\\"  (This is another bonus of Mahon's book in that he punctuates it with the actual words used by those who knew Maxwell or uses Maxwell's actual words.)<br /><br />In the latter case, we learn of Maxwell's extensive legacy.  His achievements are too numerous to list but perhaps Einstein said it best:<br /><br />\\"One scientific epoch ended and another began with James Clerk Maxwell.\\"<br /><br />There are more than twenty black-and-white illustrations located in the center of this book.  I found these interesting.<br /><br />You don't have to be a science wiz to read this book.  However, it would be helpful to have some basic science background or have access to a good science dictionary if you want to fully understand the science parts of this book.<br /><br />Once you've finished reading the main narrative of this book, that's it.  Well, no.  The Notes gives some interesting information that did not make into the main narrative.<br /><br />Finally, I was surprised by two things:<br /><br />(1) Mahon did not mention the curious coincidence that the year in which Maxwell died  (1879), was the same year that Einstein was born.<br />(2) There was an electromagnetic unit named after Maxwell called, appropriately, the \\"maxwell\\" (symbol: Mx).  It has been recently replaced by another name.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fascinating book that gives us insight into a neglected scientific icon.  I'm glad this book gave me the opportunity to know a little about James Clerk Maxwell!!<br /><br />(first published 2003;  list of illustrations;  preface;  acknowledgements;  chronology;  cast of characters;  introduction;  12 chapters;  main narrative 185 pages;  notes;  bibliography;  index)<br /><br />+++++troduction;  12 chapters;  main narrative 185 pages;  notes;  bibliography;  index)<br /><br />+++++	2005-07-16

These letters (that were never meant to be published) show the human side of these brilliant physicists.<br /><br />This book has an overall introduction broken up into seven sections:<br /><br />(1) Note on this new edition by Gustav Born (one of Max Born's sons).<br />(2) Acknowledgements for this new edition again by Gustav.<br />(3) A Modern Preface to this new edition by historian Diana Buchwald and physicist Kip Thorne.<br />(4) Forward to the original edition by Nobel Prize-winning philosopher Lord Bertrand Russell.<br />(5) Introduction to the original edition by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Werner Heisenberg.<br />(6) Acknowledgements to the original edition by Max Born.<br />(7) A kind of Preamble to the letters again by Max.<br /><br />Then we come to:<br /><br />(8) \\"The Born-Einstein Letters\\"<br />(9) \\"Index\\"<br /><br />I recommend reading the seven sections of the overall introduction first before reading the actual letters themselves.<br /><br />Special mention should be given to the Modern Preface (written in Sept. 2004) to this new edition.  This section is very thorough (it has more than 60 footnotes) explaining everything you need to know about the letters themselves.<br /><br />The \\"Born-Einstein Letters\\" themselves are numbered for easy reference.  The first letter is dated (Feb. 27, 1916) while the last is dated (Jan. 29, 1955).  There are commentaries, explanations, and autobiographical remarks by Born accompanying almost every letter. As the modern preface says:<br /><br /> \\"These commentaries are striking in their candor, in their admiration for Einstein and the apparent need for Born to comprehend and explain some of the major disagreements with Einstein over the years.\\"<br /><br />This collection of 120 translated letters itself can be broken down as follows:<br /><br />(i) 39 letters from Einstein to Born<br />(ii) 7 from Einstein to (Born and his wife Hedwig nicknamed \\"Hedi\\")<br />(iii) 17 letters between Einstein and Hedi<br />(iv) 48 from Born to Einstein<br />(v) 3 from (Born and Hedi) to Einstein<br />(vi) 1 from Born to Einstein's second wife<br />(vii) 1 in each direction between Einstein and Born and Max's friend, the physicist James Franck<br />(viii) 3 from Wolfgang Pauli, a theoretical physicist, to Born<br /><br />As the modern preface says:<br /><br />\\"The letters themselves constitute one of the most vivid and valuable testimonies in the development of modern science.  They also tell us much about the personal hardships that Einstein and Born overcame during two world wars, the vagaries of academic life, the daily grind of administrative work, and the steadfastness and frailty of human relationships.  Throughout runs a scientific dialogue that was central to their lives...<br /><br />[Most of these letters] attest to the close, lively, and at times turbulent relationship among [Born, Hedi, and Einstein].  Esteem, affection, and occasional criticism from the Borns is countered by warmth from Einstein with occasional flirtatiousness toward Hedi and at times defensive, even wounded humor...<br /><br />Born included [the 3 letters from Pauli (as indicated in viii above)] as they illuminate a misunderstanding between himself and Einstein about quantum mechanics...<br /><br />The frequency, topics, and tone of the letters...reflect the initial closeness, and cooling and final rapprochement between Einstein and Born.  Between 1916 and 1920 both wrote to each other eagerly.  After Einstein's rise to national and international fame, they exchanged less than four letters per year on average, until the final year and a half of Einstein's life, when the early warmth returned and their correspondence regained its original intensity.\\"<br /><br />The themes in these letters and Born's commentaries impart an \\"impressive tapestry.\\"  Some include those of a personal nature such as Einstein's philosophy of life; his relaxed attitude towards mistakes in his scientific work; and Born's disappointment over the poor early recognition of his contributions to quantum theory.  Larger social and political themes include Communism; Zionism; Born's and Einstein's extensive efforts to help Jewish scientists in the wake of Hitler's rise to power; the Holocaust; the atomic bomb; Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and the evolution of Germany after World War Two.<br /><br />In these letters we meet a large number of distinguished scientists of the era.  We also see the extensive range of scientific issues that occupied Born and Einstein during their careers.<br /><br />A highlight of this book (for me, at least) is the historical 1927 black and white photo of almost 30 distinguished scientists (all men except one woman) of that time.  Born and Einstein are highlighted in this photo.<br /><br />Don't worry!  You don't have to know any science to read this book.  You can simply skip those science parts you don't understand.  However, knowing some science or having access to a good science dictionary would be beneficial.<br /><br />Finally, there were two problems I found with this book:<br /><br />First, there is no table of contents.  I thought this odd since the book is so well organized.  Instead there is only a title page that only lists (without giving page numbers) 5 of the 9 sections indicated above.  For a book of such important historical and scientific historical magnitude, I thought this was a major oversight.<br /><br />Secondly, the index is only a name index.  There is no subject index.  Why?  There is an impressive array of topics covered in these historical letters (some of which I touched on above).  Thus, I think a subject index should have been mandatory.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a unique book that includes the actual letters between Albert Einstein and Max Born.  Be sure to read this book and see why Born said, \\"With [Einstein's] death, we, my wife and I, lost our dearest friend.\\"<br /><br />(first published in English 1971;  this edition published 2005;  overall introduction of 7 sections;  120 letters with commentaries;  overall introduction and letters comprise 270 pages;  name index)<br /><br />+++++nd Born's commentaries impart an \\"impressive tapestry.\\"  Some include those of a personal nature such as Einstein's philosophy of life; his relaxed attitude towards mistakes in his scientific work; and Born's disappointment over the poor early recognition of his contributions to quantum theory.

Because as the late, great philosopher Bertrand Russell said, \\"It is all likely to come true.\\"<br /><br />Huxley through one of his characters early on makes this startling statement: \\"[T]he secret of happiness and virtue [is] liking what you've got to do.  [Techniques have to be developed so] people like [or love] their non-escapable social destiny [of servitude].\\"<br /><br />In this novel, this \\"love of servitude\\" has been accomplished through suitable scientific techniques.  The result is an antiseptic new world where \\"[t]he world's [socially] stable...People are [artificially] happy;  they get what they want, and never want what they can't get.  They're well off; they're safe; they're never ill; they're not afraid of death; they're blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they're plagued with no mothers or fathers; they've got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they're so conditioned that they...can't help behaving as they ought to behave.  And if anything goes wrong, there's the [universal, pleasurable drug] soma [as well as recreational sex].\\"<br /><br />Conditioning is the technique for establishing desirable behavior patterns.  \\"Soma\\" in this novel is a powerful calming and hallucinogenic drug without any serious side effects.<br /><br />There's \\"no mothers and fathers\\" because a foolproof system of eugenics (the movement for improving the human species through control of hereditary factors) has been mechanically designed to standardize humans in places called \\"hatcheries.\\"  This mechanical standardization of humans has been pushed to fantastic though, I feel not impossible, extremes.  The system of mechanical eugenics in this novel enables humans to be \\"processed\\" into classes based on intelligence.<br /><br />This novel is filled with numerous interesting concepts and ideas.  For example, the time this novel takes place in is 632 \\"A.F.\\"  A.F. stands for After the Death of Ford.  This refers to Henry Ford (1863 to 1947) who was a US auto manufacturer and developer of the assembly line.  (This means this novel takes place in the late twenty-sixth century.)<br /><br />There are basically two storylines in this novel.  The first is about a person who was \\"born\\" in a hatchery but rebels against this new world's social order.  The second is about a person who was actually born to a woman and thus now has trouble fitting into this new world.<br /><br />Generally, the entire novel is about how the advancement of science affects human individuals.<br /><br />This novel is excellently written.  I have to admit I had difficulty at first because Huxley plunges right into his futuristic society (thus younger readers and impatient readers may have difficulty with this novel).  However, I kept on reading and discovered that everything comes together by the end of the novel.<br /><br />Finally, after reading this novel, I recommend the thought-provoking science-fiction movie \\"Gattaca\\" (1997).  I also recommend the non-fiction book authored by Huxley entitled \\"Brave New World Revisited\\" (1958).<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fantastic, futuristic novel whose ideas will stay with you long after you have finished reading it.  It is also a prophetic novel because many of the ideas presented may now be starting to come true!!!<br /><br />(first published 1932;  forward by the author;  18 chapters;  main narrative of 275 pages)<br /><br />+++++ample, the time this novel takes place in is 632 \\"A.F.\\"  A.F. stands for After the Death of Ford.

We have taken it to be more perfect than it is and less extraordinary than it can be.\\"<br /><br />This easy to read book is divided into three sections:<br /><br />(1) Fallibility of Surgeons.<br /><br />It asks, among other things, how mistakes happen, how a novice learns to cut into a living human, what a good doctor is, and how it is that a good one could go bad.<br /><br />(2) Mysteries and Unknowns of Medicine.<br /><br />It struggles as to precisely what to do about them.  Included in this part is a story about a young women whose awful nausea won't go away and a T.V. newscaster whose blushing became so severe that she could no longer function in her job.<br /><br />(3) Uncertainty in Medicine.  Gawande explains:<br /><br />\\"What seems most vital and interesting is not how much we in medicine know but how much we don't-and how we might grapple with that ignorance more wisely.\\"<br /><br />There are two main things I liked about this book:<br /><br />(1) Real-Life Surgical Stories.  I felt I was alongside Gawande when he was doing an operation.  Knowing some basic anatomy would be helpful in understanding the full impact of these stories.<br /><br />(2) Gawande's Honesty.  Personally, I was expecting defensiveness but to my surprise there was complete honesty throughout the book which I found refreshing.  For example, here is a quotation from the excellent introduction:<br /><br />\\"We look for medicine to be an orderly field of knowledge and procedure.  But it is not.  It is an imperfect science, an enterprise of constantly changing knowledge, uncertain information, fallible individuals, and at the same time lives [are] on the line.  There is science in what we do, yes, but also habit, intuition, and sometimes plain old guessing.\\"<br /><br />Here are five more examples:<br /><br />(1)  \\"Do we ever tell patients that because we [meaning surgical residents] are still new at something, their risks will inevitably be higher, and that they'd likely do better with others who are more experienced?...[W]ho in their right mind would agree to be practiced upon?\\"<br />(2) \\"[A]ll doctors make terrible mistakes.\\"  Several chapters later he says, \\"Equally troubling, people seem happy to let us off the hook [for our mistakes].\\"<br />(3) \\"Most surgeons are sued at least once in the course of their careers.\\"<br />(4) \\"Mistakes are an inevitable part of medicine.\\"<br />(5) \\"Medicine's ground state is uncertainty.  And wisdom-for both patients and doctors-is defined by how one copes with it.\\"<br /><br />Who is this book for?  I would say for all people since we all have the potential of landing on a surgeon's table.  People who idolize doctors and surgeons (for example, those with the annoying habit of calling doctors \\"docs\\") will probably raise their eyebrows when reading some sections of this book.  Personally, I wonder how Gawande was perceived by his fellow colleagues after this book was published.<br /><br />Finally, to get more insight into medicine and the people who practice it, I recommend these two books:<br /><br />\\"Confessions of a Medical Heretic\\" by Robert Mendelsohn, M.D. and \\"The Medical Mafia\\" by Guylaine Lanctot, M.D.<br /><br />In conclusion, this honest book contains a surgeon's notes on an imperfect science.  I guarantee that after you read it, you will never look at a surgeon the same way again!!<br /><br />(first published 2002;  author's note;  introduction;  3 parts or 14 chapters; main narrative 250 pages;  notes;  acknowledgements)<br /><br />+++++t also habit, intuition, and sometimes plain old guessing.\\"<br /><br />Here are five more examples:<br /><br />(1)  \\"Do we ever tell patients that because we [meaning surgical residents] are still new at something, their risks will inevitably be higher, and that they'd likely do better with others who are more experienced?...[W]ho in their right mind would agree to be practiced upon?\\"<br />(2) \\"[A]ll doctors make terrible mistakes.\\"  Several chapters later he says, \\"Equally troubling, people seem happy to let us off the hook [for our mistakes].\\"<br />(3) \\"Most surgeons are sued at least once in the course of their careers.\\"<br />(4) \\"Mistakes are an inevitable part of medicine.\\"<br />(5) \\"Medicine's ground state is uncertainty.

I guarantee that after you read it, you will never look at a surgeon the same way again!!<br /><br />(first published 2002;  author's note;  introduction;  3 parts or 14 chapters; main narrative 250 pages;  notes;  acknowledgements)<br /><br />+++++	2005-07-02

By the time he became an adult, Lee was \\"obsessed with money.\\"  However, Lee recognized he had a serious problem and was able to travel the very bumpy road to recovery through the practice of a Twelve Step program.<br /><br />This book is divided into two parts.  Part one entitled \\"My drug of choice\\" consists of eleven chapters.  Part two entitled \\"The road to recovery\\" consists of seven chapters.  There is also an epilogue along with two appendices.<br /><br />This book is very easy to read.  Lee includes psychological terms in his main narrative and defines everything quite well so you're never lost.  His writing style is straight forward and to the point.<br /><br />In my opinion, the strongest thing about this book is Lee's complete honesty.  He tells the reader everything (and I mean everything) about what went on during this turbulent time of his life.  The result for me is that I found myself rooting for him.<br /><br />Finally, whom is this book meant for?  I would say anybody who is interested in knowing about addictions (like myself).  It also should be of benefit to those patients and families who are struggling with gambling problems as well as the therapists who treat them.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fascinating book that details the life of a gambling addict and how he gradually overcame his demons.  It is a must-read for those who don't want to be sucked into the miserable life of gambling!!<br /><br />(first published 2005;  preface; acknowledgements;  2 parts or 18 chapters with epilogue;  main narrative 270 pages;  2 appendices)<br /><br />+++++ain narrative 270 pages;  2 appendices)<br /><br />+++++	2005-07-01

In this book, there is, as in the previous two novels, a prologue and epilogue.  Between are 15 chapters or \\"sessions\\" (as opposed to 16 each in the previous two novels).  Unique to this book is a \\"Suggested Additional Reading\\" list or bibliography.<br /><br />The prologue is excellent.  What it does is cover the highlights of the first two novels then tells us why this third novel was written:<br /><br />\\"All...of my thirty-two sessions with Robert/[P]rot [recall that Robert Porter was thought to be the main personality hidden within Prot] are described more fully in K-PAX and K-PAX II [subtitled \\"On A Beam of Light\\"] which ended with the birth of [Prot's]...[Earthling] son...in the summer of 1997.  At that time it appeared the family...might, at last, live happily ever after.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this turned out not to be the case...\\"<br /><br />Thus this novel is not simply a rehash of the two previous novels.<br /><br />Prot (pronounced \\"Pr-OAT\\") is treated by the same psychiatrist of the previous two novels, Dr. Gene Brewer.  (Note that the doctor has the same name as the author.)  In this third novel, there seems to be more interaction between other characters and Dr. Brewer, not just with Prot exclusively.<br /><br />Prot's  wit, wisdom, and humor shines through in this novel.  Recall that he had this in the first novel also but seemed to have lost some of this in the second novel.  It was good to see him in top-form again.<br /><br />Prot still demonstrates certain otherworldly abilities and even his medical tests are strange.  Both Dr. Brewer and the reader are still not sure whether Prot is indeed an extraterrestrial or a traumatized human suffering from \\"multiple personality disorder.\\"<br /><br />In this novel, there is more interest in finding out what happened to Robert.  As well, the reader is introduced to many new and interesting patients such as \\"Alex Trebeck\\" and \\"Albert Einstein.\\"  Prot, as before, has a positive influence on all patients.<br /><br />Suspense is created when Prot reveals that he is going back to K-PAX for good and will bring 100 of his fellow patients with him.  (Why not 200 or 1000?  You'll have to read this novel to find out.)<br /><br />The epilogue as with the prologue is also excellent.  We get two possible explanations as to whom Prot is.  As well, we are told that \\"a great many questions\\" still remain.  The last paragraph of the epilogue has Dr. Brewer \\"look[ing] toward the constellation Lyra\\" (where Prot's home planet of K-PAX is located) and wondering...<br /><br />Can this concluding sequel be read without reading the previous two novels?  Yes, I think so.  This is because the prologue to this novel is so well written.  Besides, the author includes in his \\"suggested additional reading\\" list the prior two novels, K-PAX and K-PAX II.  Why would he list these if he assumed that the reader had already read these novels?<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good novel that will hold your attention to the end.  As well, it is a good conclusion to the K-PAX trilogy!!!<br /><br />(first published 2002;  prologue;  15 chapters covering sessions 33 to 47;  epilogue;  main narrative 265 pages;  suggested additional reading list;  acknowledgements)<br /><br />+++++ebeck\\" and \\"Albert Einstein.\\"  Prot, as before, has a positive influence on all patients.<br /><br />Suspense is created when Prot reveals that he is going back to K-PAX for good and will bring 100 of his fellow patients with him.

However, let me warn you: you won't find anything new in it, but you will find much that is not generally applied.\\"<br /><br />Carnegie also states:<br /><br />\\"One thing is certain: this book is practical.  You can set [or sink] your teeth in it.\\"<br /><br />A great feature of this book besides the information it contains is its summaries, thus making it very easy to read.  Most chapters contain rules in boldface type that are summary statements of the entire chapter.  For example, what is the rule for chapter 17?  Just turn to the end of this chapter and you'll see it:<br /><br />\\"When fate hands us a lemon, let's try to make a lemonade.\\"<br /><br />Besides these chapter summary statements, each part or section (except part 5 and the last part) contains a summary entitled \\"Part...in a Nutshell.\\"  For example, this is the summary for section four:<br /><br />\\"Part Four in a Nutshell: Seven Ways to cultivate a mental attitude that will bring you health and happiness.\\"  Then there is a listing of the seven rules that are the summaries of each of the seven chapters that make up this section or part.<br /><br />The last section contains thirty-one inspirational, true stories with the theme of \\"how I conquered worry.\\"  At the end of most of these stories is a brief summary point in boldface type that summarizes the entire story.  For example, there is a story entitled \\"I was warned not to speak or to move even a finger\\" by J.L. Ryan.  The summary point for this story is as follows:<br /><br />\\"Mr. Ryan is alive today because he made use of the principle...Face the worst that can happen.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the only problem I had with this book is that it has no notes or footnotes and no references.  Carnegie tells us early on that he read \\"what the philosophers of all ages had said about worry.  [He] also read hundreds of biographies, all the way from Confucius to Churchill.  [He] also interviewed scores of prominent people in many walks of life.\\"  This is impressive but none of this is documented formally in this book!<br /><br />However, he does give credit to some of his sources in his narrative but these are informal, incomplete references.  Still I spotted many things that were not referenced even informally.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a practical, concrete, easy-to-read, inspiring handbook on conquering a major problem of humankind.

Books	4	6	8	N	N	An Absolutely Essential Book for Lovers of the Truth!!!	+++++<br /><br />This book by philosophy teacher Doug Krueger answers eight questions \\"which are important for an understanding of atheism and representative of the type of questions which are often asked of atheists.\\"  Thus this book fills a need for a concise introduction to atheism \\"which avoids the technical analysis of the professional philosopher yet which sacrifices little accuracy.\\"<br /><br />To represent the theistic view, Christianity is most often used.  Why?  Because \\"in our culture Christianity is the most widespread religion which asserts the existence of God.\\"  But the author stresses that what can be said of Christianity \\"may also be said of other versions of theism, their claims about their gods, and their holy books.\\"<br /><br />Is the author trying to convert theists?  NO.  Krueger says this more eloquently:<br /><br />\\"I harbor no illusions about the possibility of changing the minds of theists.  Most have believed in [G]od since childhood and will [probably] never abandon that belief...it is my hope that this work may free some theists from the intellectual domination born of fear and ignorance and allow [them] to make an informed choice about how they should view their lives and the universe in which they live.\\"<br /><br />The eight questions posed deal with atheism and atheists (three questions), God's existence (four questions), and faith (one question).<br /><br />The answers to each of these questions take up an entire chapter.  These answers are extremely well laid out with each major point Krueger making having a separate subheading (indicated by a an upper case letter) and explanatory points (indicated by some other character such as a number, lower case letter, etc.) to discuss that major point.  The result:  this book is very, very easy to read.<br /><br />For example, here are the subheadings of the answer to the first question \\"What is Atheism?:\\"<br /><br />A. *Atheism may be defined as the view that there are no gods.<br />1. Theism will be defined as the view that the traditional God exists.<br />2. There are two definitions of atheism.<br />a. The atheist does not assert that there are gods.<br />b. The atheist denies that there are gods.<br /><br />B. *There are common misconceptions about atheism.<br />1. People become atheists so they can do whatever they want.<br />2. An atheist is one who hates God.<br />3. An atheist is one who worships Satan.<br />4. Everyone worships something.  An atheist must have some god.<br />5. A person becomes an atheist because of a fight with a priest, pastor, etc.<br />6. All atheists believe in the same thing, a certain view.<br /><br />Each chapter ends in most cases with a helpful conclusion.  As well there are notes to document the footnotes indicated throughout each chapter.<br /><br />A brief but excellent conclusion ends the book.  At the end of this conclusion is a \\"Summary of the argument Against Belief in Gods.\\"  I found this to be concise, elegant, and logically valid.<br /><br />Finally, there are two problems I found with this book:<br /><br />First, even though each chapter is referenced quite well, there are still some assertions that Krueger makes that are not documented.  All assertions have to be thoroughly documented especially when dealing with this subject.<br /><br />Second, this book is not indexed.  Even though this book is supposed to be \\"a short introduction\\" to atheism, Krueger still presents a wealth of information that I feel should be indexed to make the book more user friendly.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book presents a concise introduction to atheism, an important and intellectually powerful alternative to the religious outlook so prevalent today.<br /><br />(first published 1998;  preface;  acknowledgements;  9 chapters;  main narrative 220 pages;  suggested readings)<br /><br />+++++m will be defined as the view that the traditional God exists.<br />2.

It wasn't until I read this book that I discovered how wrong I was!<br /><br />This short science fiction novel was written by French author Pierre Boulle (1912 to 1994) and published in 1963 under the title \\"La Planete des Singes.\\"  It was later translated into English under the title \\"Planet of the Apes.\\"<br /><br />Boulle (pronounced \\"boo-ll\\") saw his novel as a social fantasy.  I see it as a science fiction social satire.  Among other things, it shows the stupidity of established authority, the vanity of human ambition, and the nature of our own society.  As well, the science presented in this book is quite well done.  The novel is actually an intelligent tome and mindless action is kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Those who like an author to impart concrete messages will probably not like this book.  What Boulle does is provide the information and lets you decide.  Personally I like this.<br /><br />This novel has three parts.  Part one covers chapters (1 to 17).  The second part covers chapters (18 to 26).  The final part covers chapters (27 to 38).  Each chapter on average is seven pages long.<br /><br />The novel begins when two space vacationers find a written message:<br /><br />\\"I am confiding this manuscript to space, not with the intention of saving myself, but to help, perhaps, to avert the appalling scourge that is menacing the human race.  Lord have pity on us!\\"<br /><br />The person who wrote this manuscript narrates the entire book.  He is one of three astronauts that lands on what seems to be a sister-planet to Earth.  But appearances can be deceiving!  They soon discover that on this world humans are the beasts and apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans) are their intelligent masters.<br /><br />I enjoyed the not one but (count them) two surprise endings.  Actually, I found a series of surprises between chapters 31 and 38.<br /><br />There are only two things in this novel that I found somewhat unrealistic.  But since this is fiction, this is acceptable.<br /><br />Finally, there are usually comparisons with the 1968 movie that has the same title as the book.  There are some similarities with the book but many more differences.  The 2001 remake has only one similarity with the book.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a bizarre and ingenious science fiction novel.

The electrical devices investigated are as follows: telegraph, telephone, light bulb, electric motor, radio, radar, and computer.  Even human biological devices are looked into-specifically the nervous system and brain.  Bodanis says this more eloquently:<br /><br />\\"The world is made of electric charges and our technologies operate through electric charges, and even our brains are powered by electric charges.\\"<br /><br />The author does present some of the science behind electricity.  (Electricity is a general term used for all phenomena caused by electric charge.)  But he seems to concentrate only on DC or Direct Current (a term he never uses).  (Direct Current is electric charge always flowing in the same direction.)  Nothing (not one word!!) is said about the more important AC or Alternating Current and its colorful scientific history.  This I feel was a major, major oversight.  (Alternating Current is a flow of electric charge that periodically reverses its direction.)<br /><br />Chapter 1 to chapter 6 of this 12-chapter book presents the scientific history of direct current.  I feel Bodanis does a decent job here with his explanations and portraits of major scientists.  In fact, I feel that his writing style is very engaging throughout the book.<br /><br />The next two chapters discuss radar.  Unfortunately, the author goes into way too much detail about the war effort and strays significantly off topic.  I feel all this information was not needed.<br /><br />Chapter 9 and chapter 10 discuss the idea of a \\"thinking machine\\" (what we now call the computer) and the man behind this revolutionary idea.  As well, this man's legacy is explained.  This information is well presented.<br /><br />The last two chapters look into human biology.  Here we learn that \\"our entire body operates by electricity.\\"  I found this information very interesting but felt that most of it was not relevant to the theme of the book.<br /><br />There are two more brief sections at the end of this book.  They are entitled as follows:<br /><br />(1) \\"What happened next.\\"  This section profiles what happened to the major people mentioned in this book.  Some of these people include Samuel Morse, Alexander G. Bell, Edison, Faraday, Hertz, and Turing.  I found this section interesting.<br /><br />(2) \\"Mr. Amp, Mr. Volt, and Mr. Watt.\\"  These units (amp, volt and watt) describe, according to Bodanis, \\"what's happening inside all...electric devices.\\"  What happened to Mr. Ohm?  An ohm is a measure of electrical resistance.  I thought not mentioning this unit was a major oversight.<br /><br />Finally, there are no illustrations in this book.  I felt simple diagrams would have reduced the book's wordiness.  As well, pictures of some of the major people mentioned would have been nice.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a well-written book about electricity that has some major oversights and that, in some cases, presents irrelevant information.<br /><br />(first published 2005;  introduction;  6 parts or 12 chapters; 2 concluding sections;  main narrative 235 pages;  notes;  further reading;  acknowledgements;  index)<br /><br />+++++Here we learn that \\"our entire body operates by electricity.\\"  I found this information very interesting but felt that most of it was not relevant to the theme of the book.<br /><br />There are two more brief sections at the end of this book.

Stanley and Danko explain:<br /><br />\\"The research for [this book] is the most comprehensive ever conducted on who the wealthy are in America--and how they got that way.  Much of this research was developed from the most recent survey we conducted [from May 1995 through January 1996] that, in turn, was developed from studies we had conducted over the previous twenty years.  These studies included personal and focus group interviews with more than five hundred millionaires and surveys of more than eleven thousand high-net worth and/or high-income respondents.\\"<br /><br />What the authors discovered from their survey is found in this book.  Perhaps most helpful to readers is that they discovered \\"seven common denominators [or principles used by] those who successfully build wealth.\\"  Be aware that, and Stanley and Danko emphasize this, there are no sure principles that one can follow to become wealthy.  (In this book, the threshold level of being wealthy is having a net worth of $1 million or more.)  However, the principles outlined in this book will guarantee that you are on the right track to becoming wealthy.  The authors say this more eloquently:<br /><br />\\"If you are willing to make the necessary trade-offs of your time, energy, and consumption habits [then] you can begin building wealth and achieving financial independence.  [This book] will start you on this journey.\\"<br /><br />In this book, the reader studies the seven characteristics or principles of the wealthy.  There are over thirty tables to supplement the written text as well as three appendices.  Also, this book is quite easy and straightforward to read.<br /><br />After reading this book, you should be able to answer many questions such as the following nine:<br /><br />(1) Who are the wealthy?<br />(2) What is wealth?  What is income?<br />(3) What are three words that profile the affluent?<br />(4) How do millionaires maintain their affluent status?<br />(5) How do most millionaires measure their success?<br />(6) Why are the two authors of this book, who are experts on wealth, not wealthy themselves?<br />(7) What should you do whatever your level of income?<br />(8) What is the number one income-consuming category among the affluent?<br />(9) You can predict if someone is a millionaire by the type of business they are in.

US	45789111	R3TW7WNSRO90FA	047143499X	848395247	Bad Medicine: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Distance Healing to Vitamin O	Books	3	11	26	N	N	A Good but Incomplete Book	+++++<br /><br />This book, by joke writer and science writer Christopher Wanjek, explains \\"Bad Medicine.\\"  He does not define this term but upon reading his book, it seems that it is medicine that does not have a rational cure for disease.  By implication then, \\"Good Medicine\\" is medicine that does have a rational cure for disease.  Wanjek implies that traditional medicine as it is practiced today with surgery, radiation, and drugs is good medicine.<br /><br />This book has seven parts that encompass more than forty easy to read very brief chapters.  Below I will give the title of each part and chapter (that are not the same as in the book):<br /><br />(I) *Dispelling certain myths (9 chapters)<br /><br />(1) How the brain works (2) Brain size and intelligence (3) How the eyes work (4) How the tongue works (5) Detoxification myths (6) The Appendix: useful or not? (7) Why hair turns gray (8) Baldness cures (9) Human race defined<br /><br />(II) *Aging (5 chapters)<br /><br />(1) Memory (2) Vitality (3) Disease (4) Life Span (5) Longevity and Genetics<br /><br />(III) *Cause and cure of certain diseases (6 chapters)<br /><br />(1) The Black Plague in the modern age (2) The common cold (3) Are all bacteria bad? (4) Radiation (5) Cancer and Sharks  (6) What your genes say about your future health<br /><br />(IV) *Nutrition myths (5 chapters)<br /><br />(1) Antioxidants (2) Obesity (3) Cow's Milk (4) Organic Food (5) Water: Bottled versus Tap<br /><br />(V) *Alternative Medicine (8 chapters)<br /><br />(1) Homeopathy (2) Magnetism (3) Ayurveda (4) Aromatherapy (5) Oxygen (6) Touch Therapy (7) Herbs (8) The true dangers of vaccines<br /><br />(VI) *Risk (4 chapters)<br /><br />(1) Science of toxicity (2) How health studies work (3) Important health study findings (4) Rating America's health<br /><br />(VII) *Bad medicine in the news and at the movies (4 chapters)<br /><br />(1) Accuracy of TV medical news (2) Guns and their aftereffects (3) Getting knocked out in Hollywood and in reality (4) A Hollywood heart attack versus a real heart attack<br /><br />There is also an appendix that gives almost fifteen more examples of bad medicine.  These were not entered into the main narrative because (I guess) they were not bad enough.  There are also a dozen illustrations in this book.<br /><br />Many chapters in this book are good especially those parts of chapters where Wanjek explains how things work.  I should emphasize that such information can be found in a good medical text or even on a reliable internet site.  It is nice, though, to have this information in one small volume.  He also does a good job in explaining medical myths.<br /><br />There are many chapters that, I feel, are too brief and somewhat simplistic.  One obvious example is the chapter on vaccinations.  This is a huge, controversial subject that Wanjek attempts to reduce to a mere six pages!  He should read the classic book \\"The Medical Mafia\\" by Guylaine Lanctot, M.D.  In her book, Dr. Lanctot clearly states that:<br /><br />\\"The big lie [that vaccines protect us] has been perpetuated for 150 years despite the: (1) Ineffectiveness of vaccines in protecting against illness (2) Uselessness of certain vaccines (3) Innumerable complications of vaccines [that go] from minor problems...to death (4) Numerous...complaints [against vaccines] continually repeated by...conscientious [MDs] (5) Parent leagues and associations [that warn about the dangers of vaccinations] (6) Legal actions...that are so numerous that they have threatened the very livelihood of certain manufactures of vaccines (7) Catastrophic and staggering consequences of extensive neurological deficiency, which effects a great number of children, following [the administering of vaccinations] (8) Frightening and unforeseen effects [associated after administering vaccinations].\\"<br /><br />It should be of no surprise that Wanjek puts down the alternative medicine he mentions.  He should read the classic book \\"Confessions of a Medical Heretic\\" by Robert Mendelsohn, M.D.  In his book, Dr. Mendelsohn clearly says,<br /><br /> \\"Get used to the idea right away that no single system can or should claim to have an exclusive fix on the dynamics of health.\\"<br /><br />Another interesting thing I found in this book occurs on the last page of the main narrative as well as on the last page of the \\"recommended reading.\\"  The last page of the book touts the fame of \\"[the late LINUS] PAULING, [James] Watson, and [the late Francis] Crick.\\"  These people were true scientists and made important discoveries.  They truly deserve praise.  Watson and Crick won a shared Nobel Prize but LINUS PAULING won two unshared Nobel Prizes, a remarkable achievement.  On the last page of the Recommended Reading section, Wanjek mentions the value of an internet site called \\"Quackwatch.\\"<br /><br />Quackwatch is a good site that I've visited many times since it \\"combats health care fraud, myths, and fads.\\"  It also interestingly enough has a list of people, both living and dead, to AVOID getting health advice from (through their books).<br /><br />There are two things that any person that reads this long list will find interesting.

I wonder what Wanjek would think of this?<br /><br />I found other minor problems with this book.<br /><br />Finally, this book, as I have said, is easy to read.  However, Wanjek writes in a smart-alecky style.  Perhaps this is his joke writing skills coming through.  Personally, I was not offended by this but some readers may<br />be.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a highly readable book on an important subject.

US	45789111	R3D39QF56JDA4R	0393050572	948966865	Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Filling in the Gaps of Shakespeare's Life	+++++<br /><br />This extremely well written book, by Harvard University Professor, editor, and author Stephen Greenblatt attempts to explain \\"How Shakespeare became Shakespeare\\" (the book's subtitle) by filling in the knowledge gaps that are unknown about his life.<br /><br />Greenblatt explains:<br /><br />\\"This is a book...about an amazing success story that has resisted explanation: it aims to discover the actual person who wrote the most important body of imaginative literature of the last thousand years...it aims to tread the shadowy paths that lead from the life he lived into the literature he created...[literature] so astonishing, so luminous, that it seems to have come from a god and not a mortal.\\"<br /><br />How does Greenblatt propose to do this?  Answer: Through rational speculation and conjecture.  Greenblatt explains this more eloquently:<br /><br />\\"There are huge gaps in knowledge that make any biographical study of Shakespeare an exercise in speculation...[since]so much...from [his] life [is uncertain].\\"<br /><br />The author's speculation considers the time in which Shakespeare lived.  Thus we learn much about Elizabethan England and Elizabethan theatre during the time Shakespeare lived (April 23, 1564 to April 23, 1616).  Greenblatt takes the facts that are known about Shakespeare's life (which are minimal) and when factual gaps in his life do occur (there are many), the author fills these in with rational speculation.  The result is a possible profile of a person called William Shakespeare.<br /><br />Greenblatt considers the few facts known about Shakespeare's parentage, birth, early life, marriage, the \\"lost years\\" (from 1585 to 1592, there are no official records of Shakespeare) and the \\"London years\\" (no one knows exactly when he moved to London or how he supported himself when he first got there) and knits them together through speculation and conjecture to form a coherent story.<br /><br />The latter half of this book seems to lose some focus.  Greenblatt at this point analyzes some of Shakespeare's plays and sonnets in order to gain clues as to exactly who Shakespeare was and what was going on in his life.  (He wrote 39 plays that scholars know of between 1590 and 1613 including a play that was lost and 154 sonnets.)  Here, Greenblatt is assuming that art imitates life and that Shakespeare did indeed write the works attributed to him.<br /><br />For the most part, Greenblatt looks in detail at the plays written during Shakespeare's greatest period (1599 to 1608).  Some of these plays include the following:<br /><br />\\"Twelfth Night,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" \\"Othello,\\" \\"Measure for Measure,\\" \\"King Lear,\\" \\"Macbeth (my personal favorite), \\"As You Like It,\\" and \\"Antony and Cleopatra.\\"<br /><br />Greenblatt's analysis is well done and interesting.  For example, I found the conjecture of exactly who the great comic character \\"Falstaff\\" was based on extremely interesting.<br /><br />Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets.  (A sonnet is a highly structured poem with 14 lines and a specific rhyme scheme.)  Of this total, Greenblatt looks at 36 or about 25% of them.<br /><br />I felt that Greenblatt was reading too much into these plays and sonnets.  (This is very easy to do.)  As well,  I felt he was straying too much off his main theme of attempting to determine who Shakespeare was.<br /><br />This brings up the question: can only those who are very familiar with Shakespeare's plays and sonnets read this book?  No.  Greenblatt gives enough background information so you don't have to be familiar with Shakespeare's works.  However, it would enhance your enjoyment of this book if you are familiar with some of them beforehand.<br /><br />This book contains two, four-page inserts of 12 pictures each.  Many of these are in color.  I found these pictures interesting.<br /><br />A problem I had is with this book's subtitle (stated above in the first paragraph of this review).  I think it should more accurately be \\"How Shakespeare POSSIBLYBecame Shakespeare.\\"<br /><br />Finally, I recommend the following book: \\"The Friendly Shakespeare\\" (1993) by Norrie Epstein. It also gives tidbits about Shakespeare not mentioned in Greenblatt's book.<br /><br />In conclusion, can I state with certainty that this is an accurate biography of the Bard?  No.  But I can say with one hundred percent accuracy that this book gives some fascinating insights into whom possibly William Shakespeare was and possibly how he became who he was!!<br /><br />(first published 2004;  preface;  acknowledgements;  note to the reader;  12 chapters;  main narrative 370 pages;  references;  index)<br /><br />+++++Became Shakespeare.\\"<br /><br />Finally, I recommend the following book: \\"The Friendly Shakespeare\\" (1993) by Norrie Epstein.

For example, consider this letter from another artist written during the last years of Leonardo's life:<br /><br />\\"[The King], being enamoured to such an extraordinary degree of Leonardo's great talents, took such pleasure in hearing him talk that he would only on a few days deprive himself of his company...I cannot resist repeating the words I heard the King say about him...he said that a man had never been born who knew as much as Leonardo, not only in the spheres of painting, sculpture, and architecture, but in that he was a very great philosopher.\\"<br /><br />This book contains almost twenty-five reproductions of Leonardo's drawings peppered throughout.  My personal favorites are Leonardo's engineering drawings and anatomical drawings.  There are also twenty mainly color plates (in two sets of ten plates).  These consist mainly of reproductions of Leonardo's paintings.  My personal favorites are the \\"Mona Lisa\\" and the \\"Last Supper.\\"  There is also a \\"Gallery\\" of his paintings at the end of the book.  This gallery consists of nearly twenty-five reproductions.<br /><br />The very last section of the book has \\"Leonardo's Life in Outline.\\"  It traces his life from when he was born in 1452 until he died in 1519.  This is especially good because it gives the reader, in brief form, an overall view of Leonardo's life.<br /><br />This book's greatest service is that it separates fact from fiction.  Kemp explains: \\"For the writer of fiction, the license [regarding Leonardo's life] is almost unlimited.  Dan Brown's phenomenally successful  `The Da Vinci Code' [is an example which presents fictional facts].  In the service of fiction, such unfounded `facts' are fine; as history they perpetrate nonsense.  The problem with Brown's \\"Code\\" is not the invention of `truth;' but that it has been taken seriously by those who cannot recognize fiction as fiction.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the only minor problem I had is that the table of contents lists what drawings are found in this book but it does not specify what page these drawings are found on.  I found this frustrating if I had to refer to a specific drawing.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book explores Leonardo da Vinci's life and works.

The first part was published in 1667 and the second part in 1671 by a then blind poet named John Milton (1608 to 1674).<br /><br />\\"Paradise Lost\\" consists of twelve long chapters or \\"books.\\"  \\"Paradise Regained\\" is the more subdued and much simpler second part and consists of four books.  The first part is centered around the biblical story of the fall of Adam and Eve and ranges from heaven to hell while the second part is the story of Satan's triple temptation of the Son of God in the wilderness.<br /><br />Both parts of this poem can be read for their magnificent poetry, their powerful imagery and language, their imaginative vision and storytelling, or their complex and passionate view of human suffering.<br /><br />My favorite lines from this poem are:<br /><br />\\" The mind is its own place, and in itself,<br />Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.\\"<br /><br />Besides the poem, this particular book has three main features:<br /><br />(1) Introduction by Dr. Susanne Woods, a Professor of English (at Wheaton College in Massachusetts).  It is excellent and provides valuable insight on Milton's poem.<br /><br />(2) Notes and Footnotes by Chris Ricks, a professor of humanities (at Boston University).  Each chapter or book of the poem begins with a brief \\"argument,\\" a note that summarizes in modern English each book's contents.  I found these an invaluable aid.  As well, there are footnotes throughout that help the reader with obscure language and indicate nuances and puns.<br /><br />(3) Chronology of Milton's life.  When did Milton go blind?  Was Milton married?  Was Milton ever arrested?  These are the sorts of questions that are answered instantly in this section.<br /><br />This poem can be a challenging read but ultimately worth it.

Greene elaborates:<br /><br />\\"[These] laws are based on the writings of men and women who have studied and mastered the game of power.  These writings span a period of more than three thousand years and were created in civilizations as disparate as ancient China and Renaissance Italy; yet they share common threads and themes, together hinting at the essence of power that have yet to be fully articulated.  [These laws] are the distillation of this accumulated wisdom, gathered from the writings of the most illustrious strategists...statesmen...courtiers [an attendant of a royal court]...seducers...and con artists in history.\\"<br /><br />Who inspired Greene to write this book?  Greene answers this question:<br /><br /> \\"To those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipulate, torture, and cause me pain over the years, I bear no grudges and I thank you for supplying me with the inspiration for [this book].\\"<br /><br />What is the premise of this book?  Answer: \\"Certain actions almost always increase one's power...while others decrease it and even ruin us.\\"<br /><br />Generally each law (that has its own chapter) is explained using five sections:<br /><br />(1) Judgment: is a brief explanation of the law.<br />(2) Transgression of the law: a historical example of how the law was broken and the consequences that followed.<br />(3) Observance of the law: a historical example of how the law was used properly.<br />(4) Keys to power: explaining why the law works.<br />(5) Reversal:  what you can do to make the law work smoothly and situations where the law can backfire.  (A very important section.)<br /><br />Each law has a word picture that the author calls an \\"image\\" to help you remember the law.  There is also a quotation from an \\"authority,\\" a person the author considers to be a power expert (like Machiavelli or Napolean).  Each chapter also has fables, short stories, letter extracts, quotations from philosophers, etc. to illustrate the importance of the law.  Note that the image, authority, fables, etc. are in red print.<br /><br />This book seems to be meant for two kinds of people: those who want power or those who want to defend themselves against power (like myself).  Many of these principles are easy to use but some are more difficult to use.  The greatest asset of this book, I feel, is defending yourself against power.<br /><br />Some of these laws are manipulative and difficult to execute.  For such laws, I would just know how they work in case someone tries to use such a manipulative law on you.  Also, don't fool yourself into thinking that all other people are ethical and moral.  Machiavelli (1469 to 1527) elaborates:<br /><br />\\"Any [person] who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good.  Hence a prince [or princess] who wants to keep his [or her] authority must learn not to be good, and use that knowledge , or refrain from using it, as necessity requires.\\"<br /><br />Finally, some of these laws may seem contradictory.  Remember that these are not laws of physics but laws of human interaction.  Laws of human interaction change depending on the situation & on the circumstances and thus have to be selectively used.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fascinating book that will give the reader valuable insight into human power and its laws.<br /><br />(first published 1998;  preface;  48 chapters;  main narrative 430 pages;  bibliography;  index)<br /><br />+++++Napolean).

US	45789111	R3EAK1H4IAYZBM	0310241448	911984495	The Case for a Creator: A Journalist Investigates Scientific Evidence That Points Toward God	Books	3	11	16	N	N	The Supernatural versus Science	+++++<br /><br />In this book, former investigative reporter, former legal affairs editor, former atheist, former teaching pastor, and author Lee Strobel interviews seven theist male scholars (that is \\"scientists and science-trained philosophers\\") from the intelligent design movement to document their views of the evidence supporting intelligent design.  The book's emphasis is on science, religion, and as mentioned, interviews with scientists.<br /><br />Strobel assigns himself to the role of skeptic in these interviews.  Each interview is a chapter in this book.  The eight topics respectively for each interview are as follows: Darwinism or evolution, faith in science, cosmology (the study of the structure and origin of the universe), physics, astronomy, biochemistry, DNA research, and human consciousness.  It is from these interviews that the author encounters scientific evidence for a creator or what he calls \\"a supernatural God.\\"<br /><br />At this point, we should define the word \\"science.\\"  Science is the study of nature using the scientific method.  The scientific method is the method of learning about nature from making observations, formulating hypotheses (unproved theories tentatively accepted to explain certain facts), and constructing reproducible observational or experimental tests to see if the hypotheses are accurate.  Science above all is a human activity.<br /><br />On the other hand, the word \\"supernatural\\" means existing or occurring outside the normal experience or knowledge of humans; supernatural events are not explainable by the known forces or laws of nature.  We have no tools to observe, measure, and experiment on something that's supernatural or miraculous.  So this puts the supernatural out of science's reach.  (Note that this does not necessarily mean that the supernatural does not exist but only that science can't evaluate it.)<br /><br />Thus, supernatural means the opposite of science.  Therefore, I was very interested to know how scientific evidence could point to a supernatural God.<br /><br />The evidence that Strobel uncovers is what science can't explain (within the confines of the eight topics mentioned above).  So, for example, cosmology can't explain at present what caused the Big Bang (the explosion-like event that is thought to have initiated the universe).  The theist scientist whom Strobel interviews introduces a supernatural explanation and says that God caused it.<br /><br />Some of the mysteries Strobel's theist interviewees present are, at the present time, big mysteries.  But lack of an answer is not sufficient reason to suppose the supernatural.  This is known as the \\"God of the gaps\\" (a term actually used by one of Strobel's scholarly interviewees) where God is presumed to be the answer to gaps in our knowledge.<br /><br />Each chapter ends with Strobel's conclusion based on what he has learned from a particular interview.  After his conclusion he goes into the religious aspects of his conclusion.  It should also be mentioned that each of Strobel's interviewees discusses his personal thoughts about how his belief in God has impacted his life.  (I must confess I failed to see the relevance of this.)<br /><br />All the above apply to the middle eight chapters of this book.  The first two chapters generally chronicles Strobel's journey from atheist to theist.  The last chapter is a summary of the entire book and discusses the religious implications of Strobel's conclusions formulated in the middle eight chapters.<br /><br />I feel that the science presented is presented quite well even though I did find some minor inaccuracies and a few major ones.  Illustrations (of which there aren't any) might have been helpful especially to those who are not familiar with the scientific concepts presented.<br /><br />Finally, there is an appendix to this book that contains two items.  The first item \\"is a summary of the historical evidence for Jesus Christ from thirteen leading experts who wereinterviewed from [Strobel's earlier] book `The Case for Christ.'\\"  The second item contains chapter-by-chapter questions for individual or group study.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book will be reacted to differently by different readers.

Reynolds elaborates: \\"Amongst other things, this book outlines a grounding in meteorology for those who want to gain a basic understanding of what makes the weather `tick,' and to appreciate what lies behind some of today's great atmospheric environmental issues.<br /><br />Each chapter of this nine-chapter book begins with a brief summary:<br /><br />(1) The Atmosphere<br /><br />\\"Before looking at the weather in detail, it is necessary to set the scene by explaining some basic facts about the atmosphere's chemical make-up, its structure and layering, and what drives it to on a global scale.  This basic knowledge will help you understand subsequent chapters.\\"<br /><br />(2) Weather Observation<br /><br /> \\"Many people take more than just a conversational interest in the atmosphere by recording weather measurements at home.  In some countries, there are networks of enthusiasts who produce regular newsletters that often include members' observations.  The advent of the internet has facilitated even wider links between observers on an intercontinental scale.\\"<br /><br />(3) Weather Mapping<br /><br />\\"Portraying the elements of both the `actual' weather and its forecast state as a...map, for one instant, is crucial in...meteorology.  Satellite and radar `images' also aid in the visualization of extensive [weather] detail in a quickly [non-overwhelming] form.  Much of the complexity of the atmosphere is, and will remain, summarized in map form that is truly international language for meteorology.\\"<br /><br />(4) Global Weather<br /><br />\\"It is important to understand the links between patterns of global [atmospheric] pressure, circulation, temperature, humidity, and precipitation before investigating individual weather-producing disturbances such as...hurricanes and typhoons.\\"<br /><br />(5) How the Weather Works<br /><br />\\"Every day, we all experience one facet or another of the weather, even if this is only the view from a window on a dull day...What makes the wind blow?  How do clouds form and stay in the sky?  How do they produce rain, snow, and drizzle?  Why are there different types of fog?  How do dew and frost form?  These topics [and more] are discussed in this chapter.\\"<br /><br />(6) Weather Forecasting<br /><br />\\"To most people, the main aim of the meteorologist is to prepare and present a weather forecast.  Furthermore, television is probably the most common medium through which they obtain information on what is likely to happen over the next day or so weather-wise.\\"<br /><br />(7) Hazardous Weather<br /><br />\\"In many parts of the world, the most common natural hazard to effect society is the weather.  Its impact may be very short lived-from the disastrous transit of a tornado, to the potentially devastating passage of widespread gales that may last a day or so-or much more extensive, such as widespread flooding that may persist for weeks, or drought that may last for a season.\\"<br /><br />(8) World Holiday Weather<br /><br />\\"This chapter gives general information on the duration of various aspects of the climate, at a variety of holiday and other locations.\\"  (Note that this chapter provides a graph for monthly temperature, monthly rainfall, and monthly sunlight for each location or city profiled.  This information is particularly useful for travelers.)<br /><br />(9) Environmental Issues<br /><br />\\"During the last decade or so, we have become more aware of global or near-global changes in the atmosphere that have occurred naturally or through the activities of [humans]...El Nino, global warming, and the `hole' in the ozone layer are three environmental issues that are described in detail in this chapter.\\"<br /><br />In a few places within this book are internet addresses for major sites that provide up-to-date details of various topics within weather and climate.<br /><br />This book has more than 300 illustrations (photographs, satellite imagery, maps, or diagrams), most in color.  Also included are graphs, tables and charts.  In fact, almost every page of this book contains at least one illustration, graph, table, or chart.<br /><br />Finally, there is a handy glossary that provides definitions of common (examples: \\"precipitation,\\" \\"snow\\") and uncommon (examples: \\"cut-off,\\" \\"southern oscillation\\") weather terms.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book concisely and adequately explains a fascinating subject important to all of us--the weather!!<br /><br />(first published 2000;  preface;  introduction;  9 chapters;  main narrative 180 pages; glossary; further reading; acknowledgements; index)<br /><br />+++++etails of various topics within weather and climate.<br /><br />This book has more than 300 illustrations (photographs, satellite imagery, maps, or diagrams), most in color.

Below I will state the main focus of each chapter.  (Note that the chapter order is not necessarily the same as that in the book):<br /><br />(1) Cadaveric use in dissection and surgical instruction<br /><br />(2) Human decay and what can be done about it<br /><br />(3) How do you know if you're dead?<br /><br />(4) History of body snatching and other gruesome activities<br /><br />(5) Decapitation and the human head transplant<br /><br />(6) Cadaveric medicine and cannibalism<br /><br />(7) How to dispose of a body (such as by cremation or human composting)<br /><br />(8) The science of impact tolerance (using human crash test dummies)<br /><br />(9) Crash analysis: when passenger bodies must tell the real story<br /><br />(10) Cadaver use in law enforcement and in the army<br /><br />(11) Cadaver use in crucifixion experiments<br /><br />(12) The author's conundrum: how will she allow her dead body to be used?<br /><br />Roach throughout her book asks all the questions that most of us have probably thought of but never dared to ask.  Despite being gruesome at times, she does it with sensitive wit and style thus making the subject matter a little easier to handle.  The result:  she is able to hold the reader's attention from beginning to end.  (I found that some parts of this book are written better than others.)<br /><br />The humor (never at the expense of the dead) in the main narrative of this book caused me to smile, giggle, chuckle, and even occasionally to laugh out loud.  Recommendation: don't read this book in a place where you are expected to be quiet such as a library.<br /><br />To be sure, Roach provides the reader with the scientific aspects behind cadavers and their invaluable uses.  But the reader is also exposed to the history of cadavers and history of the related activities associated with them.  (Some readers may think she delves too much into these related activities.)<br /><br />This book does not discuss only human cadavers.  Non-human animals, both dead and alive, are also discussed.  Thus, highly sensitive animal lovers may have difficulty with some of the research that Roach has uncovered.  (Note some of what Roach has uncovered with respect to animals may seem gruesome but remember Roach is just conveying what her research reveals.)<br /><br />Footnotes, often humorous, permeate this book.  As well, black and white photographs accompany the beginning of each chapter.<br /><br />Finally, my only major problem with this book is that it has no index.  There are so many facts and stories about human cadavers and related activities in this book that I feel that the omission of an index was a major oversight.  A minor complaint is with respect to the book's chapter order.  I feel the chapter order was somewhat haphazard.  Thus, I read the book in the chapter order indicated above.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book effectively and humorously tells the curious story of our bodies when we are no longer with them.  You'll discover that once you're dead, there's still plenty your body can do!!<br /><br />(first published 2003; introduction; 12 chapters; main narrative 300 pages; acknowledgements; bibliography)<br /><br />+++++hold the reader's attention from beginning to end.

The actual name that Marlowe gave his play was \\"The troublesome reign and lamentable death of Edward, the second King of England, with the tragical fall of Mortimer.\\"  (Mortimer is Edward's nemesis in the play.)<br /><br />The precise date of this play is not accurately known, but it is generally thought to have been written circa 1590.<br /><br />Marlowe condenses, omits, elaborates, and rearranges actual historical events in order to gain dramatic effectiveness, and to bring out Edward's character and the results of his weakness.  So the action in the play covers a historical period of just over twenty years (near the end of the fourteenth century) even though such a period of time is not suggested by the play itself.<br /><br />Marlowe effectively succeeds in giving a true, as well as a powerful picture of the character and fate of Edward the Second.  This play masterfully shows the delineation of character, the construction of plot, and the freedom and variety of the mostly blank verse.<br /><br />Readers of Shakespeare's plays (especially \\"Henry the Eighth\\" and \\"Richard the Second\\") should find it quite easy to read this relatively succinct play.  Even those not familiar with Shakespeare's plays or even Elizabethan drama should have little difficulty with this play.  Footnotes are minimal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this play has been labeled a \\"Gay Play.\\"  This is not quite accurate.  Edward was bisexual because he had a queen who he had a son with (the future Edward the Third) and, as well, had a male partner (named Piers Gaveston).  Gaveston too was bisexual since he was not only attracted to Edward but also to Edward's niece!  Edward's queen is heterosexual because she is later attracted to Mortimer after Edward starts ignoring her.<br /><br />Sexual orientation is actually a small part of this play.  The play is about a king who loses control of his kingdom.  Edward's brother says this early on to Edward: \\"My Lord, I see your love to Gaveston / Will be the ruin of the realm and you.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the last scene of the play is truly magnificent as Edward's son, now King, gets revenge for his father's murder.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a great play that can be enjoyed by those who are heterosexual (like myself), bisexual, or homosexual.  Also, in my opinion, this history play closely rivals Shakespeare's history plays.<br /><br />(this book first published 1999; play written circa 1590; 95 pages)<br /><br />+++++'s queen is heterosexual because she is later attracted to Mortimer after Edward starts ignoring her.<br /><br />Sexual orientation is actually a small part of this play.

These short essays were written between 1925 and 1935.<br /><br />Russell writes in an elegant, readable and understandable style.  His arguments are well thought out.<br /><br />The essays consider social questions not discussed in politics.  The general theme that ties these essays together is that the world suffers from dogmatism and narrowness; what is needed is the willingness to question dogma.<br /><br />The essays are a blend of philosophy with other disciplines such as psychology, economics, science, and history.  All the essays are brutally honest and forthright.  Each essay is packed with a load of wisdom.  What's amazing is that these essays are as current today as when they were first written and they will probably remain relevant into the future.<br /><br />My five favorite essays in this collection include the following:<br /><br />(1) \\"In Praise of Idleness.\\"  Discusses work and the importance of leisure.  In order to get a sample of Russell's insight that permeates this book, here's a sentence from this essay: \\"The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.\\"<br /><br />(2) \\"'Useless' Knowledge.\\"  States that all knowledge is useful not only knowledge that has a practical value.<br /><br />(3) \\"The Case for Socialism.\\"  Russell gives nine arguments in favor of socialism, most notably the need for preventing war.<br /><br />(4) \\"Western Civilization.\\"  Discusses its characteristics.  One sentence from this essay that I like is, \\"I cannot escape from the conclusion that the great ages of progress have depended upon a small number of individuals of transcendent utility.\\"<br /><br />(5) \\"Education and Discipline.\\"  My favorite sentence from this essay is as follows: \\"Education...must be something more positive than a mere opportunity for growth...it must...also provide a mental and moral equipment [for] children.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is Bertrand Russell at his best.  Enjoy!!<br /><br />(first published in 1935; preface to this edition; introduction; original preface; 13 chapters, main narrative 150 pages; index)<br /><br />+++++than a mere opportunity for growth...it must...also provide a mental and moral equipment [for] children.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is Bertrand Russell at his best.

The mythical Madame Curie remains perhaps the most famous woman scientist in the world...There is no doubt that over the last century Madame Curie's life has evolved into a towering image of perfection.  But behind the image was a real woman.  It was that person I wished to pursue.\\"<br /><br />The above comes near the end of the introduction of author and historian Barbara Goldsmith's easy-to-read book subtitled \\"The Inner World of Marie Curie.\\"  She does indeed take us into Curie's \\"inner world\\" peeling away the layers of myth and giving us an unforgettable portrait of Polish immigrant Marie Curie nee Marya (Manya) Salomee Sklodowska, known to the world as Madame Curie.<br /><br />This book can be divided into four sections:<br /><br />(1) The time (1867 to 1895) that Marie was unmarried (chapters 1 to 4).<br /><br />(2) The time (1896 to 1906) when she was married to the distinguished physicist Pierre Curie to become Madame Marie Curie (chapters 5 to 12).  She along with her husband and one other scientist shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903.<br /><br />(3) The time (1907 to 1934) when she was without Pierre (chapters 13 to 20).  She won an unshared Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911.<br /><br />(4) A profiling of Madame Curie's two female children, their families, and their significant achievements (chapter 21).<br /><br />She and Pierre won the 1903 Nobel Prize, \\"in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena.\\"  She won the 1911 Prize \\"in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the [radioactive] elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium, and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.\\"<br /><br />I disagree with the above \\"Publishers Weekly Editorial Review\\" that says this book \\"is weakest at explaining the theoretical basis for Curie's scientific breakthroughs.\\"  I found the science was well explained and understandable.<br /><br />I did, however, find a few minor inaccuracies in this book.  One major inaccuracy is when Goldsmith states that one of Curie's daughters and her husband (both scientists) won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1935 \\"for their discovery of artificial radioactivity.\\"  Actually, this was only one aspect of their work.  According to the official Nobel Prize internet site, they won it \\"in recognition of their synthesis of new radioactive elements.\\"<br /><br />There are more than fifteen illustrations (mostly black and white photographs) that permeate this book.  I found all of them interesting.<br /><br />The acknowledgements section of this book is also interesting.  We are told that one of Madame Curie's daughters and her granddaughter  \\"decided [in the mid-1990s] to donate the Curie publications, diaries, journals, and workbooks [of the Curies that were originally sealed three years after Madame Curie's death] to the Bibliotheque Nationale on the rue Richelieu [a national library in Paris].\\"  One problem though.  After seventy-five years, these papers were still radioactive!  They had to be decontaminated, a process that took two years.  Goldsmith used in her biography much of the information found in these documents -- documents Goldsmith admits were \\"not easy to access.\\"  Thus much of the information in Goldsmith's biography is absolutely new, accurate information that you won't fine anywhere else!  Goldsmith includes, in many cases, the actual words (in the form of letters, etc.) of Madame Curie and significant others in her bibliography.<br /><br />The bibliography is well laid out.  The sources used are from three main places: (1) Books & Articles (2) Archival Sources (Bibliotheque Nationale, Institut Curie in Paris, and the New York University Science Library) (3) Journals, Newspapers, Magazines (from Sweden, England, U.S., Austria, and France).<br /><br />This book has no index.  Although not absolutely necessary, I feel one would have been useful if you want to access information for later reference.<br /><br />Finally, for a dramatized depiction of Marie Curie's life, I recommend the movie \\"Madame Curie\\" (1943) starring Greer Garson and Walter Pigeon.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book accurately describes the \\"tragic and glorious life\\" of \\"one of the greatest scientists of the twentieth century\\" namely Madame Marie Curie (Nov. 1867 to July 1934).<br /><br />(first published 2004; introduction with 21 chapters; main narrative of 235 pages; acknowledgements; notes; bibliography; photo credits)<br /><br />+++++nd France).<br /><br />This book has no index.

But always pity brought me back to earth.\\"<br /><br />This is how philosopher Bertrand Russell's (1872 to 1970) autobiography begins.  This book (first published in three separate volumes) is brilliantly and simply written, emotionally charged, witty and wise, honest, and historically interesting.  It spans almost a century of social and intellectual change.  I would say that it is one of the great autobiographies in the English language from a man who was a towering intellectual and humanitarian figure of the twentieth century.  As well, this book confirms why Russell, who authored more than seventy-five books, won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950.<br /><br />His prize according to the official Nobel Prize internet site was awarded \\"in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought.\\"<br /><br />Throughout his book, Russell describes his philosophical disputes and quarrels, his rise to honors, his many friendships with high profile people, and his religious and social self-questioning.  He was a maverick that stuck to his convictions even if they got him into trouble (he was jailed at age 46 and again at 88).  He never failed to stand up and be counted on any matter that stirred his conscience and ideals.<br /><br />A highlight of this book is that it includes the actual letters between Lord or Earl Russell and a long list of influential people of his time (many whose names are easily recognized today) at the end of each chapter.  As well, illustrations (mainly in the form of black and white photographs) are found throughout.<br /><br />Even though this autobiography is to me brutally honest (for example, \\"I used to...watch the sunset and contemplate suicide.  I did not...commit suicide because I wished to know more of mathematics\\"), I felt that Russell was holding back on revealing certain aspects of his life.<br /><br />Finally, the last words in Russell's autobiography are found in the postscript:<br /><br />\\"I have lived in the pursuit of vision, both personal and social.  Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, and for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times.  Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them.

US	45789111	R2V71KBGFRZOG1	014014739X	701670710	Journey through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics	Books	5	8	8	N	N	How to Appreciate the Power and Beauty of Mathematics	+++++<br /><br />A highlight of this easy-to-read book, by Dr. William Dunham, is that it explores twelve \\"great theorems of mathematics\\" that have occurred throughout history.  (A theorem is a statement or proposition that is proved by logical reasoning from given facts and justifiable assumptions.)  Dunham calls the theorems he explores \\"mathematical masterpieces\\" or \\"mathematical landmarks.\\"  He tries to get the reader to appreciate the \\"creativity\\" evident in them.<br /><br />Four of the theorems presented were formulated in very ancient times.  (For example, two were formulated circa 300 BC.)  One was formulated in the first century, another was formulated in the sixteenth century, and two each were formulated in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries respectively.<br /><br />What factors influenced Dunham to choose his particular theorems that \\"represent the best of mathematics\\" or what he calls the \\"Mona Lisas or Hamlets of mathematics?\\"  Answer: (1) the theorems had to be insightful (2) they had to be formulated from history's leading mathematicians and (3) they had to be important (that is they had to resolve long-standing problems in mathematics or generate even more profound future questions).<br /><br />The theorems themselves come from different branches of mathematics, that is, a variety are presented.  As Dunham states: \\"The propositions of [this] book come from the realms of plane geometry, algebra, number theory, analysis, and [set theory].\\"<br /><br />In general, to understand these theorems requires high school algebra and geometry.  Some trigonometry and elementary integral calculus would also be useful.<br /><br />However, this book is much more than just theorems.  It details the history of important events in mathematics and puts these theorems in historical context.

Its title is \\"Salesman at Fifty.\\" (This play was published in 1949.)<br />(2) Actual play itself that has two acts and a requiem.  (In fact, the subtitle of this play is \\"Certain Private Conversations in Two Acts and a Requiem.\\")<br />(3) Still pictures in black & white and color from the first production of this play in 1949 (starring Lee J. Cobb) and the 50th anniversary production of this play in 1999 (starring Brian Dennehy).  There are eleven of these pictures found between the first and second acts.<br />(4) Afterword by Chris Bigsby (an author, playwright, broadcaster, and University professor).  This afterward is an excellent detailed analysis of the play from which I learned much.<br />(5) Selective chronology of world productions of this play from 1949 to 1999.  For example, one entry has the play put on film for CBS in the US in 1985.  The lead character was played by Dustin Hoffmann.<br /><br />The actual Pulitzer Prize-winning play itself is unforgettable.  It is about hard-working, traveling salesman Willy Loman, a man whose life has become a permanent nervous breakdown, due to a kind of \\"success mania.\\"  He's about to lose his job, he can't pay his bills, and his sons Biff  & \\"Happy\\" don't respect him and can't seem to live up to their potential.  His wife stills loves him but she is caught up in a state of \\"bitter helplessness.\\"  Willy, now in his sixties, wonders what went wrong (after all, his dream of monetary success should have come true by now!!) and how he can make things up to his family.  He is now indeed a \\"low man.\\"<br /><br />I shall provide a quotation from Miller's preface and from Bigsby's afterword both of which seem to capture the essence of the play:<br /><br />Miller:<br /><br />\\"The Lomans [especially Willy], like [society's] models...are not content with who and what they are, but want to be other, wealthier, more cultivated [and] closer to power.\\"<br /><br />Bigsby:<br /><br />The story of Willy Loman is \\"a dream shared by all those who are aware of the gap between what they might have been and what they are, who need to believe that their children will reach out for the [monetary] prize that eluded them, and who feel that the demands of reality are too [absolute] and relentless to be sustained without hope of a transformed tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />Finally, I saw the movie version of this play (starring Dustin Hoffmann) first and then read the actual play.  I found that when I did this, the actual play was easier to read and follow.<br /><br />In conclusion, Arthur Miller has left us a gem of a play that is truly \\"one of the greatest dramas of our time.\\"<br /><br />(published 1999; play is 110 pages; entire book is 145 pages)<br /><br />+++++e the essence of the play:<br /><br />Miller:<br /><br />\\"The Lomans [especially Willy], like [society's] models...are not content with who and what they are, but want to be other, wealthier, more cultivated [and] closer to power.\\"<br /><br />Bigsby:<br /><br />The story of Willy Loman is \\"a dream shared by all those who are aware of the gap between what they might have been and what they are, who need to believe that their children will reach out for the [monetary] prize that eluded them, and who feel that the demands of reality are too [absolute] and relentless to be sustained without hope of a transformed tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />Finally, I saw the movie version of this play (starring Dustin Hoffmann) first and then read the actual play.

There are also four sets of intriguing and beautiful black & white pictures, a total of almost seventy-five in total.<br /><br />The areas of the world he travels too are Peru, Bolivia, Central America, and Egypt.  Personally, I found the two parts on Egypt very interesting and fascinating.<br /><br />I discovered that you can't rate this book properly without rating various criteria of it.  (It seems that some of my fellow reviewers below based their rating on just one criterion of this book making it worse or better than it really is.)  What I will do is rate this book on five criteria and my true rating will be an average.<br /><br />On the basis of what Hancock observed and the many questions he asks about what he's observed, this book deserves a solid 5 star rating.  True, many modern-day scholars can answer some of these questions (unsatisfactorily in my opinion) but many of these questions remain unanswered.<br /><br />The topics covered in this book include astronomy, ancient history, archaeology, Egyptology, architecture, geology, geography, art, engineering, mythology, and mathematics.  All concepts are thoroughly explained with illustrations, in most cases, aiding the explanation.  On this basis alone, this book deserves a 5 star rating.<br /><br />I had problems with the two parts on mythology (comprised of legends, folk tales etc.).  It's easy to read too much into what a myth means, and I feel that perhaps Hancock was doing this.  Possible rating based on this: 2.5 stars.<br /><br />For a book of this type, you have to allow for speculation.  However Hancock's speculation leaves room for much argument.  Possible rating based on this: 3 stars.<br /><br />I had my main problem with Hancock's conclusion that makes up the last part of his book.  There is sound, factual, scientific evidence that strongly contradicts what Hancock claims.  On the basis of this conclusion I would give the book a 2 star<br />rating.<br /><br />Despite my low rating for Hancock's conclusion, he does state by quoting someone else, what I feel is the real conclusion of his book:<br /><br />\\"We are told that the evolution of human civilization is a linear process-that it goes from stupid caveman to smart old us with our hydrogen bombs and striped toothpaste.  But the proof [indicates] that [this may not be true].\\"<br /><br />Don't worry!  There's nothing in this book about Atlanteans, extra-terrestrials, or flying saucers.  This book comprises a serious investigation.<br /><br />Finally, I recommend this videotape set for increased understanding of this topic: \\"Quest for the Lost Civilization\\" (1998).  Also recommended is the videotape: \\"The Mystery of the Sphinx\\" (1993).<br /><br />In conclusion, this fascinating book examines and analyzes ancient mysterious.  If you like mysteries like I do, then you have to read this book!!<br /><br />*** 1/2<br /><br />(first published 1995; acknowledgements; 8 parts or 52 chapters; main narrative of 505 pages; references; select bibliography; index)<br /><br />+++++tales etc.).

Below, I will divide the essays into categories and give the question or topic addressed.  (Note the order of the essays presented here is different from that in the book):<br /><br />(1) Logic<br /><br />(i) Eight everyday reasoning errors. (An error in reasoning is called a fallacy.)<br />(ii) Seven paradoxes in reasoning. (Presented are plausible arguments leading to seemingly implausible conclusions.)<br /><br />(2) Morality<br /><br />(i) Is gay sex morally permissible?<br />(ii) Can we have morality without God and religion?<br />(iii) Is it morally acceptable to design children genetically?<br />(iv) Is it right to sacrifice the life of one conjoined twin to save the other?<br />(v) Is it morally acceptable to eat meat?<br />(vi) Is the rightness or wrongness of an act based on our emotional reactions to the act?<br /><br />(3) God<br /><br />(i) Does God exist?<br />(ii) Is creationism scientific?<br />(iii) Miracles and the supernatural.<br />(iv) Where did the universe come from?<br /><br />(4) Consciousness<br /><br />(i) Could a machine think?<br />(ii) Are you just a brain in a vat?<br />(iii) Is consciousness something impossible for science to explain?<br />(iv) What's essential as far as being you is concerned?<br />(v) How do you know that there are other minds?<br /><br />(5) Expectations<br /><br />(i) Why expect the sun to rise tomorrow?<br />(ii) Should we ever expect to be punished?<br /><br />(6) Truth<br /><br />(i) Is there such a thing as the absolute truth to any question?<br />(ii) Are mathematics and its truths ultimately made by us?<br /><br />(7) Puzzles<br /><br />(i) What is meaning, exactly?<br />(ii) What is knowledge?<br />(iii) Is time travel possible?<br />(iv) What is art, exactly?<br /><br />These essays can be read in any order desired.  In other words, you don't have to read the essays in the order indicated in the table of contents.  Their level of difficulty is indicated at the beginning of each essay.  Suggestions for further reading (including internet sites) can be found at the end of each essay.<br /><br />This book also incorporates a variety of styles.  There are dialogues, philosophical stories and thought experiments, illustrations (many of which I felt were not necessary), and sections called \\"thinking tools\\" to explain key philosophical ideas.  (These thinking tool sections, are, in my opinion, a major highlight of this book.)<br /><br />Be aware that these essays are not the definitive answers to the questions posed above but only reflect Law's views.  If you find yourself disagreeing with the author's views in any essay (as I did), then that's good and is a \\"healthy sign.\\"  It means that Law has done his job of stimulating your thinking.  Remember this is not an \\"answer\\" book but is a \\"thinking\\" book.<br /><br />I also felt that the brief introduction that has the sections \\"What is Philosophy,\\" \\"Applying Philosophy to Life,\\" and \\"Other Reasons to Think Philosophically\\" was excellent.  Be sure to read these sections first.<br /><br />I felt an absolute beginner to philosophy might have trouble with this book.  This is because major argumentative terms like premise, conclusion, counterargument, etc. are not defined at the beginning but are defined as you get further into the book.  A brief glossary would have alleviated this problem.<br /><br />As well, the logic essay on \\"Eight everyday reasoning errors\\" should, I feel, be the first essay in this book.  (Instead it is essay number 24).  In this way, the reader can get practice in trying to determine whether any of the essays presented have these errors.  My recommendation is to read this essay first after reading the above introductory sections.<br /><br />In one essay, Law's conclusion is that \\"what creationists practise isn't good science-it's bunk.\\"  I felt this conclusion as stated was too harsh and may offend some.<br /><br />Law uses some knowledge gained from science in some of his essays.  Yet he does not reference his sources.  I thought this was a major oversight.<br /><br />Finally, this book is not just an introductory text.  It can be effectively read by those who have some prior philosophy background (like myself).<br /><br />In conclusion, for a good and stimulating intellectual workout, this is the book to read!!<br /><br />(first published 2003;  acknowledgements;  introduction;  how to use this book;  25 chapters;  main narrative 285 pages;  index)<br /><br />+++++rying to determine whether any of the essays presented have these errors.

Who profits from this?<br />(5) Why are some doctors or therapists barred from practicing and others not?<br />(6) Why is treatment remunerated and not prevention?<br />(7) Why are people still dying of cancer after fifty years of intensive research at astronomical cost?<br />(8) Why is the public not properly informed about alternative medicines?<br />(9) Why is everyone so unhappy with the existing medical and hospital system?<br />(10) Why are there so many medical organizations and government medical agencies?  Whose interest are they protecting?<br /><br />The main chapters of this book answer not only these questions, but other questions as well.  These chapters are divided into four parts:<br /><br />(1) The Problem. (5 chapters.)<br /><br /> In a nutshell, the author tells us we have \\"a medicine of sickness.\\"  She goes on to say that \\"[t]his is true for the United States, as it is for Canada, France, or, for that matter, for all countries whatever their health system may be.\\"<br /><br />(2) The Solution (to the problem). (7 chapters.)<br /><br />Here, the obvious answer is \\"a medicine of health.\\"  The author tells us that this solution \\"treats the cause of illnesses and prevents them from occurring.\\"  However, this obvious solution is prevented due to ...<br /><br />(3) The Obstacle. (8 chapters.)<br /><br />  What exactly is the obstacle?  It is \\"the medical mafia.\\"  The author explains: \\"Officially, we are told that the system is at the service of the patient.  But, in practice, the system is at the service of...industry [that] pulls the strings and maintains a system [or a medicine] of sickness for its own profit.  That is the MEDICAL MAFIA.\\"<br /><br />(4) The Realization (of what should be done). (10 chapters.)<br /><br />  The author calls this \\"self-health.\\"  She explains: \\"The only one who has the ultimate power to change the system is the patient, the very reason for being of the system.  The patients will take back their power over health and exercise their sovereignty.  The doctors recognize the sovereignty of the patients and help them to exercise it.  That is self-health.\\"<br /><br />Each part ends with a very brief conclusion.  I found these insightful.<br /><br />Eyebrow-raising chapters are found in Part 3.  These chapters have their own overall subtitle: \\"The Trilogy of Lies.\\"  They deal with vaccinations, aids, and cancer respectively.<br /><br />This book is packed with diagrams, pictures, summary charts, book titles, and quotations from others.  One of my favorite quotes: \\"To vaccinate is to replace the natural immunity with an artificial immunity.\\"<br /><br />The final summary chart of this book includes the following:<br /><br />\\"The patient is at the service of the system of sickness.<br /><br />[Patients] are exploited by:<br /><br />(1) doctors<br />(2) health service providers<br />(3) pharmaceutical and technological industries.<br /><br />[These three] make people sick and keep them dependent.\\"<br /><br />Some people may have trouble with the first chapter (or so).  This is because it is somewhat abstract.  However, keep on reading.  The information that follows is very interesting and becomes more concrete.<br /><br />This book has no index.  It does not need one because the table of contents is so comprehensive.<br /><br />This book is NOT a doctor-bashing book and does not say not to see your doctor.  It, instead, looks at the entire system or machine of orthodox medicine and even society in general.  Doctors, to the author, are essentially a cog in the medical machine.  To learn more about orthodox doctors, I suggest the excellent book \\"Confessions of a Medical Heretic\\" by Dr. Robert Mendelsohn.<br /><br />The only problem with the book is that I noticed that the author uses specific numbers and statistics that are not noted or footnoted.  You have to give proper credit to the sources of this information.  However, this book is extensively referenced.<br /><br />Finally, Dr. Lanctot was stripped of her medical license and not allowed to practice medicine for life once this book was published.  (So much for free speech.)  You have to read this book to see what the medical authorities/profiteers don't want you to read!!<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're satisfied with the orthodox medical system, then there is no need to read this book.  But if you're not satisfied, then read this book and prepare to be stunned!!<br /><br />(first published 1995; prologue; 4 parts or 30 chapters; epilogue; main narrative of 240 pages; references)<br /><br />**** 1/2<br /><br />+++++al machine.

This story connects us to other times in history and to all parts of the world.  However, this story can be thought of as the story of all trees as well as all life throughout Earth.<br /><br />This book explores the many mechanisms by which the tree is able to thrive for centuries while remaining rooted in one spot.  It also looks at the tree's complex relationships with other organisms in its community, from such things as lichens, ferns, mosses, and fungi to other trees to such things as woodpeckers, squirrels, owls, cougars, bears, termites, ants, salamanders, and salmon.  In addition, this book shows how a tree connects us to the atmosphere, the soil, and the world's oceans, as well as linking us all the way back to the universe's origins.<br /><br />Examples of other topics covered include the history of botany, insect, bird, and mammal portraits, genetics, anatomy, nomenclature and taxonomy, climate, chemistry, biochemistry, and environmental issues.  The amazing thing about this book is that these topics and others are combined in such a way as to make the main narrative extremely interesting and never dull.  The authors say this more eloquently: \\"In this book, we have tried to restore a layperson's sense of wonder and questioning and added the kind of information acquired by scientists.\\"<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that \\"after millennia of study, there is still much about a tree we do not know.\\"  This book definitely tells the reader what is known not only about a tree but about life as well.<br /><br />Finally, there are over a dozen black and white illustrations in this book.  They were created by internationally known wildlife artist Robert Bateman.  These illustrations add another dimension to this book.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a book that has richly detailed text that's augmented by evocative original art.

That is, the lowest temperature possible known as \\"absolute zero\\" is 0 degrees K (minus 273.15 degrees Celsius).  And that's it!  I never realized that this was a way to honor a scientific genius named Lord Kelvin, originally William Thomson (1824 to 1907).<br /><br />This detailed, well researched, and easy-to-read book, by Dr. David Lindley, traces the life of this now little-known scientific genius and inventor.  But \\"it was not for science alone that Kelvin became famous but because of the way he brought science into ordinary life.\\"  And he brought science into ordinary life by developing numerous useful inventions (which made him a wealthy man).  And his legacy continues to this day.  For example, \\"the modern inkjet printer...uses essentially [a] trick that Thomson dreamed up in the 1860s!\\"  Or consider that Lord Kelvin's \\"ideas and principles [are] still taught today at the core of any course on basic physics.\\"<br /><br />In fact, Lord Kelvin was so well known in his day that when he died he was buried alongside Isaac Newton.  Quite an honor!<br /><br />Lord Kelvin's life was a fascinating one.  In his story, you will encounter other great legends such as Newton, Einstein, Alexander Graham Bell, Cavendish, Charles Coulomb, Pierre Curie, Charles Darwin, and James Clerk Maxwell.  He had a broad range of scientific interests.  What really intrigued me and what I found totally unexpected were his thoughts on the extraterrestrial origins of life on Earth.<br /><br />In the center of this book are nine black and white illustrations that I have not seen before.  They add another dimension to the book.<br /><br />Finally, the only minor problem I had with this book was with the idea of Kelvin's life being somehow a \\"tragedy\\" (as stated in the subtitle).  Actually, he had no more tragedies than other people.  The fact that he did not eagerly accept the theories of other scientists seems to me that he was cautious which is the mark of a good scientist.  The only real tragedy that I can see from reading this book is that history seems to have forgotten him.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fascinating story of a scientific genius and inventor.  This book is truly \\"destined to become the definitive biography of one of the most important figures in modern science!!\\"<br /><br />(first published 2004; acknowledgements; introduction; 6 chapters; epilogue; main narrative of 315 pages; 9 black and white illustrations; bibliography; notes; index)<br /><br />+++++s than other people.

Chown explains:<br /><br />\\"What follows are my dispatches from the frontier of the [scientific] imagination.  At first sight, these ideas may seem crazy.  But, then, once upon a time, the idea that time slows down for someone traveling fast or in the presence of gravity seemed crazy...Of course, the scientific imagination must work within the limits of known facts...I hope that in reading this book you will get some feeling of what a wonderful, weird, wacky Universe we find ourselves in -- a place far stranger than anything we could possibly have invented.  And I hope it gets you thinking...\\"<br /><br />This book presents its ideas in three easy-to-read parts.  The essence of each chapter will be highlighted in the form of a question:<br /><br />Part 1 (5 chapters):<br /><br />(1) Are there regions in the Universe where time runs backwards?<br /><br />(2) Are there an infinite number of realities where all possible alternative realities are played out?<br /><br />(3) Can the basic building blocks of nature (like electrons) be split?<br /><br />(4) Do atoms contain time machines?<br /><br />(5) Are extra space dimensions a possibility?<br /><br />Part 2 (4 chapters):<br /><br />(6) Is most of the mass of the Universe in the form of relatively small black holes?<br /><br />(7) Does the Universe contain invisible galaxies, stars, planets, and even invisible extraterrestrials?<br /><br />(8) Is our Universe one among an infinite number of separate and distinct universes?<br /><br />(9) Is it possible to make a universe in the laboratory?<br /><br />Part 3 (3 chapters):<br /><br />(10) Could there be billions and billions of habitable plants that are not orbiting a central star but that are traveling through interstellar space?<br /><br />(11) Was the life on Earth seeded from the depths of space?<br /><br />(12) Do extraterrestrial artifacts exist on Earth or throughout the solar system?<br /><br />Each chapter explains with no technicality each of its ideas and tells us of the extraordinary people (mainly scientists) who postulated these extraordinary ideas.  The evidence for these ideas is also presented.  As well, the problems with these ideas is also discussed.<br /><br />Readers of space and physical science should be acquainted with most of these ideas.  But they will probably not be acquainted with the large detail that Chown presents that go along with these ideas.<br /><br />I was surprised to find a large, informative glossary.

REVEALED!!!	+++++<br /><br />This book, by Professors Alfred Posamentier and Igmar Lehmann, reveals the mystery behind the constant number Pi.  It is designated by the symbol of the sixteenth lower-case letter of the Greek alphabet and is formally calculated by dividing the circumference of any circle by its diameter.  Its value is (3.14...) or approximately (22/7).<br /><br />This book convinced me that Pi is special and comes up in the most unexpected places.  The mathematics needed to fully understand this easy-to-read, informative, engaging, and fun book is \\"no more...than that of high school mathematics.\\"  Large, helpful diagrams accompany all mathematical explanations.<br /><br />This book consists of nine chapters:<br /><br />(1) Tells the reader what Pi is and how it achieved its current prominence.<br />(2) Takes the reader through a brief history of the evolution of Pi.  This history goes back four thousand years.<br />(3) Provides various methods for arriving at Pi's value.  A wide variety of methods have been chosen, \\"some precise, some experimental, and some just good<br />guessing.\\"<br />(4) Centers on activities and findings by mathematicians and math hobbyists who have explored the value of Pi and related fields in ways that the ancient mathematicians would never have dreamed of.<br />(5) Explores some of the curious phenomena that focus on the value and concept of Pi.  Primarily here is how Pi relates to other famous numbers and to seemingly unrelated concepts.<br />(6) Is dedicated to some applications of Pi.  The lesson from this chapter is that Pi is ubiquitous -- it always comes up!<br />(7) Presents some fascinating relationships involving Pi and circles.<br />(8) This is the book's epilogue.  Here, we are presented with Pi to 100,000 decimal places (which uses up almost thirty pages).<br />(9) This is an afterword by Dr. Herbert Hauptman who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985.  He is known \\"as the first mathematician to win a Nobel Prize.\\"<br /><br />This book also presents little unknown things about Pi.  For example, did you know that there is a Pi song?  How many decimal places has Pi been calculated (as of 2002)?  There is even a Pi day, a specific month and day in which this number is celebrated!  (From the information presented above, a reader of this review should be able to figure out the exact month and day.)<br /><br />After reading this book, the reader should definitely and confidently be able to say what Pi is.<br /><br />Finally, this book does tell you everything (and I mean everything) about Pi but I was surprised (especially since the afterword is by a Nobel Laureate in chemistry) that there is no mention of the chemical bond called the \\"pi bond.\\"  It is called this because of its shape.  In physics, there are elementary particles called \\"pi-mesons\\" or \\"pions.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this book takes the mystery out of the mysterious number Pi.  If you're like me and like exploring mysteries, then this is the book for you!!<br /><br />(first published 2004; acknowledgments; preface; 7 chapters; epilogue; main narrative 245 pages; afterword; four appendices; references; index)<br /><br />+++++/>This book also presents little unknown things about Pi.

About four thousand million years ago these molecules had the power to make copies of themselves.  Did these ancient replicators die out?  NO!  Why? Because they are masters of the art of survival.<br /><br />Where are these replicators now?  Answer: they are in all plants and animals including humans.  These replicators now go by the name of genes, and we are their \\"survival machines\\" or gene machines.  That is, \\"robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes.\\"<br /><br />As you read through this easy-to-understand book, you will discover that the world of the gene machine is one of competition, exploitation, and even deceit.  This is not only seen in aggression between rivals (which has its own chapter) but also in the more subtle battles between the generations and between the sexes (both of which have their own chapters).<br /><br />But what about the numerous examples of apparent altruism found throughout nature?  Dawkins shows that they all result from the selfishness of genes.  In fact, Dawkins states that the purpose of his book \\"is to examine the biology of selfishness and altruism.\\"<br /><br />The last three chapters are especially interesting.  Chapter eleven on \\"the new replicators\\" that Dawkins calls \\"memes\\" gives a startling way of looking at ourselves, and our unique culture.  Chapter twelve summarizes the results of computer simulations of different survival strategies.  Chapter thirteen is a summary of the book \\"The Extended Phenotype\\" (that Dawkins considers his best book).<br /><br />Are we slaves to the whims of our genes?  NO!  Dawkins explains early on:<br /><br />\\"My own feeling is that a human society based simply on the gene's law of universal ruthless selfishness would be a very nasty society in which to live...Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish.  Let us understand what our own selfish genes are up to, because we may then at least have the chance to upset their designs, something which no other species has ever aspired to do.\\"<br /><br />This book reads like a thriller and is definitely not a dry academic exercise.  It is packed with fascinating true stories from the animal (including human) and the insect world to illuminate the various themes that run throughout the book.  Technical jargon is avoided and where specialized words are used, they are defined.  The author states that this book will appeal to the following people:  general reader, student, and expert.<br /><br />This book is dated in a few areas with regard to analogies because it was written long ago.  Even so, this book remains a bestseller because it has withstood the test of time.<br /><br />I have a few suggestions to make this book easier to read:<br /><br />First, its true that Dawkins defines technical terms when he first presents them.  However, if these same terms appear later in the book he does not define them expecting the reader either to remember their accurate definitions or else to go back to the chapter where they were first defined.  I feel a glossary would have been handy in case the reader forgets to remember an important definition.<br /><br />Next, this book is very wordy because there are no illustrations.  I feel simple diagrams would have helped convey key ideas effectively and reduced this book's wordiness.<br /><br />Lastly, each chapter is written as one long narrative.  It would have helped to divide each chapter into sections with titles thus allowing the reader to more easily follow the discussion.<br /><br />Finally, if you enjoy this book, then I recommend reading Dawkins other book mentioned above called \\"The Extended Phenotype,\\" a continuation of this book.  As well, be sureto read his controversial (to some) book \\"The Blind Watchmaker,\\" a book on evolution.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book introduces the reader to the ultimate survival specialists.  Be sure to read this book to discover for yourself why this book is a million copy bestseller and why it has been translated into more than twenty languages!!<br /><br />(published 1990; forward; preface; 13 chapters; first eleven chapters first published 1976; last two chapters first published 1989; main narrative of 265 pages; bibliography; index)<br /><br />+++++to read his controversial (to some) book \\"The Blind Watchmaker,\\" a book on evolution.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book introduces the reader to the ultimate survival specialists.

Consider a person who schedules a plane trip.  He/she, however, decides at the last minute because of family commitments not to go on the plane trip.  A few hours later that person hears on the news that the plane he/she was to go on crashed and all people on board were killed.  Now that's what I call a lucky person.<br /><br />The author, psychologist Richard Wiseman, defines lucky people as those \\"for whom seemingly chance events tend to work out consistently in their favor.\\"<br /><br />Thus, I was excited when I read this book's back cover that stated that Wiseman had discovered \\"four scientific principles of luck.\\"  Scientific principles are derived from scientific experiments.  (Setting up scientific experiments to measure luck would have to be ingenious.)  One of the cornerstones of scientific experiments is that they are objective (meaning to involve no thoughts and feelings).<br /><br />Sadly and surprisingly (considering Wiseman's credentials) after I read this book, I found that at no point in this book are there any objective tests (that is, scientific experiments) to measure luck.  Instead, the people he uses classify themselves as \\"lucky\\" or \\"unlucky\\" and he takes their subjective (meaning to involve thoughts and feelings) word for it.  It is from these people's subjective or anecdotal stories (this book is packed with anecdotal stories) that Wiseman derives his conclusions.  (Wiseman also develops \\"Suggested Exercises\\" for the reader to do based on this subjective data.)<br /><br />In other words, this book actually analyses (with the use of graphs) the characteristics of people who think they are lucky.  From this analysis of subjective data, Wiseman comes up with \\"four principles and twelve sub-principles of luck.\\"<br /><br />This book's cover states that these \\"four...principles...will change...your life.\\"  This may be true.  Such things as being more persistent and having a positive attitude are bound to change your life.  You might feel luckier as a result.  Note however, that feeling luckier and actually changing your luck are two different things.<br /><br />Finally, this book is easy to read and has \\"Chapter Summaries.\\"  However, this book has no index.  This would be all right if the table of contents was detailed.  Unfortunately, it is not detailed making it tough to find information that you wish to refer too in the future.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book does contain principles and sub-principles derived from subjective data that may change your life and that may make you feel luckier.<br /><br />(First published 2003; acknowledgements; introduction; your luck journal; 3 parts, 9 chapters; main narrative of 200 pages; appendices; notes)<br /><br />** 1/2<br /><br />+++++tent and having a positive attitude are bound to change your life.

Character is the integration of all traits to yield a unified whole which reveals the nature or personality of a person.  Temperament is an aspect of a person's general make-up characterized by dispositions toward particular patterns of behavior (for example, emotional reactions and mood shifts).<br /><br />The authors explain the purpose of their book:<br /><br />\\"The point of this book is that people are different from each other, and that no amount of getting after them is going to change them.  Nor is there any reason to change them, because the differences are probably good, not bad.\\"<br /><br />The book begins by making the reader aware that there are four pairs of \\"dimensions of difference\\":<br /><br />(1) (Extroversion vs Introversion) or (E vs I)<br />(2) (iNtuition vs Sensation) or (N vs S)<br />(3) (Thinking vs Feeling) or (T vs F)<br />(4) (Judging vs Perceiving) or (J vs P).<br /><br />All these dimensions are thoroughly explained.  These are very important and form the basis of the entire book.<br /><br />There is a page in this book that summarizes these four dimensions.  I suggest photocopying this page and keeping it for easy reference in order to get maximum benefit from the rest of the book.<br /><br />From these four pairs of dimensions of difference, it has been determined that there are four temperament types that consist of combinations of two of the above letters.  For example, there are SPs (Sensation/Perceiving temperament).  This is also called the \\"Dionysian\\" temperament.  These temperament types are well explained.<br /><br />From these have emerged sixteen different personality or character types that consist of four letters each.  For example, there is the INTJ  (Introvert/iNtuition/Thinking/Judging).  This type is also known as the \\"scientist.\\"  In the appendix of the book, each of these sixteen types is discussed.<br /><br />The rest of the book has interesting chapters on mating & temperament, temperament in children, and temperament in leading.<br /><br />A feature of this book is that it enables you to determine your own character type.  The reader does this by completing \\"The Keirsey Temperament Sorter\\" which consists of seventy questions.  There are no right or wrong answers to these questions.  (For those with some psychology background, this sorter is based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test.)<br /><br />Finally, there is a second version of this book that has much more psycho-babble.  This book has no psycho-babble and is easy to follow.<br /><br />In conclusion, read this book to understand why people are different from each other and why that's OK!<br /><br />(first published 1978; 5 chapters; main narrative of 170 pages; appendix; bibliography)<br /><br />+++++n types is discussed.<br /><br />The rest of the book has interesting chapters on mating & temperament, temperament in children, and temperament in leading.<br /><br />A feature of this book is that it enables you to determine your own character type.

However, this book does not only dwell on Newton's science (there are many books that deal exclusively with this) but also deals with the many unknown aspects of his life besides his science.<br /><br />Gleick explains more eloquently: \\"He...led a strangely pure and obsessive life, lacking parents, lovers, and friends; quarreled bitterly with great men who crossed his life; veered at least once to the brink of madness; cloaked his work in secrecy; and yet discovered more of the essential core of human knowledge than before or after.\\"  In fact he discovered so much that one mathematician of the time asked, \\"Does he eat & drink & sleep?  Is he like other men?\\"<br /><br />To get an idea of the non-scientific topics covered in this book, I have copied some of the entries found under \\"Newton, Sir Issac\\" located in this book's index: apothecary skills of; appearance of; birth and childhood of; death of; early education of; fame of; family of; health of; knighting of; as member of Parliament; notebooks of; parents of; querulousness of; reclusiveness and secrecy of; sexuality and; theology of; wealth of.<br /><br />For science buffs, included among other scientific highlights is a good non-mathematical account of Newton's \\"Principia Mathematica,\\" surely the most influential book written in physics.  There is also discussion of his other publication entitled \\"Opticks.\\"<br /><br />Included in this book are the actual writings of Newton and others of his time.  For example, this is his first law of motion that he set down centuries ago:<br /><br />\\"Every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by forces impressed.\\"<br /><br />Even poets admired Newton's genius.  One poet wrote the following:<br /><br />\\"Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night;<br />God said, 'Let Newton be!'  And All was Light.\\"<br /><br />This book has fifteen illustrations (one in color).  As well, those looking for more information can find it in this book's 350 endnotes and more than 300 references.<br /><br />I was surprised that Gleick did not mention the International System unit in which we honor Newton.  It is appropriately called the \\"Newton\\" (symbol: N) and is the force that provides a mass of one kilogram with an acceleration of one metre per second per second.<br /><br />Finally, Newton's ideas permitted science for over 200 years until Albert Einstein came along, another giant of science.  A book similar to this book describes Einstein's science as well as the man behind the science.  It's called:<br />\\"Einstein's Cosmos\\" (2004) by Dr. Michio Kaku.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is the story of the \\"Sage and Monarch of the Age of Reason,\\" Isaac Newton (initials I.N.).

A conserver is a person who learns how to get by with less and make do with what he/she has.  A person who lives as a conserver lives \\"the conserver lifestyle.\\"<br /><br />Despite the book's title, it is actually a book for everyone: for those employed, for those without a salary, city dwellers, and country dwellers.  Or to put it another way this is a book for everyone \\"concerned with the diminishing purchase power of their dollar.\\"<br /><br />Long practices what he preaches!  All the philosophy and economic theory behind the conserver lifestyle came from him (and his family) living and surviving without a salary.<br /><br />This eleven chapter book, as the author states, revolves around three key premises:<br /><br />(I) Control expenditures and save money.  The author shows you how in his four chapters entitled:<br /><br />1. The Secondhand Market<br /><br />2. Auction Buying<br /><br />3. Alternatives to Buying<br /><br />4. Cheap Tips<br /><br />(II) Income of some sort is still required (for those who decide to survive without a salary).  This income does not have to be made through employment.  The author has a full chapter entitled:<br /><br />5. Casual Income<br /><br />(III) Preparing yourself for the conserver lifestyle takes time  (especially for those deciding to survive without a salary).  The chapters covering this are entitled:<br /><br />6. Assessing Yourself<br /><br />7. Needs<br /><br />8. Getting Ready<br /><br />There is even a chapter on how to answer questions if you decide to live the conserver lifestyle without a salary.  It's entitled:<br /><br />9. What Do You Do For a Living? (and other difficult questions).<br /><br />So far I have mentioned nine chapters.  Even though all chapters mention this, one chapter is devoted exclusively to the philosophy of the conserver lifestyle.  (This chapter also discusses other relevant topics.)  It's entitled:<br /><br />10. What's the Catch?<br /><br />Another chapter discusses taxes & insurance and how to save on them.  It's entitled:<br /><br />11. Caesar's Due.<br /><br />There are three problems I had with this book:<br /><br />First, there are no (foot)notes (or hardly any).  True the book profiles the author's personal experiences but I did notice some numbers and statistics given that were not given credit.<br /><br />Second, the author sidesteps the issue of health care.  Perhaps it is because he is Canadian and they have universal health coverage.  However, countries like the United States do not have this and since health care is expensive, it would be difficult for most Americans to leave a salaried position.  They, however, still could be conservers and live the conserver lifestyle but with a salary.<br /><br />Third, although this is not absolutely essential, it would have been helpful to have a brief summary in the form of a list at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />Note that this book has no index but since its table of contents is so comprehensive, an index is not really needed.<br /><br />Finally, there is another book that that gives a slightly different and perhaps a more comprehensive spin on this subject.  It's called \\"Your Money or Your Life\\" by Dominguez and Robin.  Another useful book is \\"The Joy of Not Working\\" by Zelinski.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a book that outlines an alternative lifestyle called the conserver lifestyle.  Discover for yourself why \\"[t]he greatest security is not in having the most, but in needing the least!\\"<br /><br />(revised edition first published 1996; preface; 11 chapters; main narrative 200 pages)<br /><br />+++++his chapter also discusses other relevant topics.)

True the book profiles the author's personal experiences but I did notice some numbers and statistics given that were not given credit.<br /><br />Second, the author sidesteps the issue of health care.  Perhaps it is because he is Canadian and they have universal health coverage.  However, countries like the United States do not have this and since health care is expensive, it would be difficult for most Americans to leave a salaried position.  They, however, still could be conservers and live the conserver lifestyle but with a salary.<br /><br />Third, although this is not absolutely essential, it would have been helpful to have a brief summary in the form of a list at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />Note that this book has no index but since its table of contents is so comprehensive, an index is not really needed.<br /><br />Finally, there is another book that that gives a slightly different and perhaps a more comprehensive spin on this subject.  It's called \\"Your Money or Your Life\\" by Dominguez and Robin.  Another useful book is \\"The Joy of Not Working\\" by Zelinski.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a book that outlines an alternative lifestyle called the conserver lifestyle.

US	45789111	R2IBEQE4S0VSQV	0375412883	331182632	The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality	Books	5	11	16	N	N	SPACE-TIME: the Final Frontier!!!	+++++<br /><br />This contents of this second book, by Dr. Brian Greene, can be determined from its title and subtitle.  To locate an event in the cosmos (or in the sky), you have to determine its three coordinates in \\"space\\" and know the \\"time\\" of the event.  Thus space and time are woven together to form the \\"fabric\\" of the cosmos known as space-time.  Greene goes on to describe the arrangement or \\"texture\\" of this woven fabric.<br /><br />The author explains more about his book: \\"In this book, we follow three hundred years of...scientific investigation seeking answers, or at least glimpses of answers, to...basic but deep questions about the nature of the universe.\\"  One of the key questions seeking to be answered is one that is \\"as encompassing as it is elusive: What is reality?\\"<br /><br />The first paragraph of this review indicates that there are at least four parts to this book (the titles of each part are not necessarily the ones used in this book):<br /><br />PART 1: Space (4 chapters)<br /><br />Space is the three-dimensional, continuous expanse extending in all directions and containing all matter.<br /><br />The first chapter of this part is an excellent one that summarizes the entire sixteen chapters of this book.<br />The remaining chapters of this part attempt to answer such questions as follows:<br /><br />(1) Is space a human abstraction or a physical entity?<br />(2) What does it mean to be separate in an extremely tiny universe?<br /><br />PART 2: Time (3 chapters)<br /><br />Time is the means by which intervals between sequential events are measured.<br /><br />This part attempts to answer the following questions:<br /><br />(1) Does time flow?<br />(2) Does time have only one direction?<br /><br />This part concludes with insights into time's nature.<br /><br />PART 3: Space-time & Cosmology (4 chapters)<br /><br />Space-time is a union of space and time originally emerging from Einstein's Special Relativity (which states that the laws of science should be the same for all freely moving observers, no matter what their speed).  It can be viewed (as alluded to above) as the \\"fabric\\" out of which the universe is fashioned; it is the arena within which the events of the universe take place.  Alternatively it can be viewed as the four-dimensional space whose points are events.<br />Cosmology is the study of the universe as a whole.<br /><br />This part (my favorite part) deals with such topics as the evolution of the cosmos, heat, nothingness, and the arrow of time (direction in which time seems to point-from past to future).<br />This part also attempts to answer the following question:<br /><br />During the Big Bang, what exactly banged?  (The Big Bang is the current accepted theory of the universe's creation.)<br /><br />PART 4:  A Possible Alternative Texture of Space-time: String Theory and the Universe (2 chapters)<br /><br />Parts (1, 2, and 3) above assumed the texture of space-time was composed of zero-dimensional particles (electrons, quarks, etc.).  However, the first chapter of this part considers the possibility that it is composed of one-dimensional filaments called strings.<br />For those who have read Greene's \\"The Elegant Universe,\\" this first chapter can be quickly skimmed or even skipped.<br /><br />I was going to skip the second chapter of this part thinking it was a rehash of \\"The Elegant Universe.\\"  I decided not too.  It turns out that this is the most interesting chapter in the entire book!  It deals with speculations on space and time in M-Theory.  (M-Theory is a theory that unites the five known string theories into one framework.)  Don't miss this fascinating chapter!<br /><br />There is a fifth and last part to this book that's more imaginative and speculative:<br /><br />PART 5:  Rethinking Space-time (3 chapters)<br /><br />This part deals with the following:<br /><br />(1) Experiments with space-time<br />(2) Travel through space-time<br />(3) Prospects for space-time.<br /><br />Even though this book is \\"intended primarily for the general reader\\" with little or no science background, I feel it would be helpful to have some basic background in physics.<br /><br />You will find only one equation in this book: Einstein's famous equation.  Instead of mathematical details, the book relies on metaphors, analogies, stories, and excellent, informative illustrations.  Another feature of this book is that when the reader reaches difficult sections, Greene warns the reader ahead of time.  He provides the option of either skipping or skimming those difficult sections and only reading a brief summary of those difficult sections.  (I chose, the majority of the time, the option of skipping difficult sections and reading their summaries.)<br /><br />This book is definitely not a rehash of Greene's \\"The Elegant Universe!\\"  It's true that initial chapters cover the necessary but standard background found in \\"The Elegant Universe\\" but subsequent chapters cover a wide range of topics designed to bring readers up to date \\"on a number of the most tantalizing and debated advances\\" found in this area of science.<br /><br />Finally, there is a very useful glossary of scientific terms at the end of this book.  This provides a succinct review of the major terms found throughout the book.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book can be summed up by the following equation:<br />(SPACE + TIME = SPACETIME).<br />To learn the cutting edge science behind the terms in this equation, you have to read this exciting book!!<br /><br />(first published 2004; preface; 16 chapters; main narrative of 500 pages; almost 150 illustrations; extensive notes; glossary; suggestions for further reading; index)<br /><br />+++++Even though this book is \\"intended primarily for the general reader\\" with little or no science background, I feel it would be helpful to have some basic background in physics.<br /><br />You will find only one equation in this book: Einstein's famous equation.

Nothing more was said.  Thus, I thought that Mendeleev was only of importance due to his association with the periodic table.  I thought this until I picked up this book and learned how wrong I was!<br /><br />This extremely well researched book (that won the Basic Prize in the History of Science) by Assistant Professor of History Michael Gordin is about Dmitrii Mendeleev (1834 to 1907) and the Russian Empire.<br /><br />This is not your typical (boring) biography that runs from Mendeleev's birth to his death.  Gordin explains: \\"I concentrate on Mendeleev and the Russian Empire from [the] Emancipation [of the Serfs in 1861] to the [Russian] Revolution of 1905, the epoch of Mendeleev's greatest chemical achievements and of Russia's greatest hope for a reformed liberal state.  I have selected seven major episodes from Mendeleev's life not because they were...the `most important'...but because each emphasizes a different feature of the cultural life of both Imperial [Russia] and nineteenth-century science.\\"<br /><br />You'll learn from this book that Mendeleev was more than just a chemist.  His other credentials include father, author, economist, bureaucrat & public servant, meteorologist, and aviator to name just a few.  Gordin elaborates: \\"[I]t is hard to conceive that one person occupied all the roles this man played.\\"  The author continues: \\"[H]is life illustrates what it was like to live and work in [Russia].\\"  As a consequence the reader will learn much about Russia in general and about St. Petersburg (the city where Mendeleev worked) in particular during the period 1860 to 1905.<br /><br />This book contains almost ten black and white illustrations and ten black and white frontispiece images.  My favorite illustration is \\"Short-form periodic system from [an]...1870 article [written by Mendeleev].\\"  A couple of the illustrations are too<br />dark.<br /><br />Although not absolutely necessary, I would know some basics of general chemistry and a bit about the history of Russia during the time period concerned in order to fully enjoy this book.  The author does do a good job in explaining basic chemical terms.<br /><br />My only minor quibble with the book is that it gives the impression that Mendeleev was the only one that made a table of the elements.  This is not quite true.  However, his was the first one that was scientifically useful.  Also, it would have been instructive to include in this book a modern periodic table to illustrate the modification that atomic numbers are now used instead of atomic weights (which Mendeleev used) to order the elements.<br /><br />Finally, I was surprised that there was no mention of the chemical element named after Mendeleev.  It's called Mendelevium (symbol Md).<br /><br />In conclusion, until this book came out, Dmitrii  Mendeleev's life was \\"shrouded in [a] historical fog.\\"  Read this book to learn why \\"he remains the most recognized Russian scientific name both at home and abroad!!\\"<br /><br />(first published 2004; note to the reader; preface; introductory chapter; 7 chapters; concluding chapter; main narrative of 250 pages; acknowledgements; extensive notes; extensive bibliography; index)<br /><br />+++++ontispiece images.

Kaku explains:<br /><br />\\"[S]cientific developments in the last few decades have given us an entirely new look into Einstein's legacy.

Considering the subject matter, I think being able to say this makes this book an extraordinary achievement.  As well, this book contains no equations (except Einstein's famous equation).  Kaku's main narrative is easy to read.  He incorporates into the main narrative the actual words used by Einstein and others.  I especially enjoyed Kaku's parenthetical statements he made throughout the book.<br /><br />I'm not sure why but this book has no index.

I resolved to begin at the beginning, finding out as much as I could about the business and how it really operates, meanwhile putting my own funds [of $16,500] into whatever would make the biggest profit.  After achieving [this] winning strategy, increasing my net worth, and achieving financial independence [or security], I'd return to tell you how I did it.\\"<br /><br />Rothchild learned how to invest by doing things such as watching late night television programs \\"on how to get rich;\\" going to financial planning places with their money managers; reading newsletters, business publications, and historical financial books; talking to successful investors in order to perhaps learn some inside information; and going to stockbrokers for information on hot stocks, making fully-informed investment decisions, and avoiding irrational markets.<br /><br />During his journey, Rothchild does a good job in explaining the mechanics of investing especially in the stock market and imparting the psychology behind investing.  Even though the author does a good job in explaining terms, I feel knowing some basics on investing before reading this book, will help the potential reader appreciate the humor and practical advice of this book even more.  (There are over twenty short useful tips in boldface type peppered throughout this book.)<br /><br />Finally, the title of this book \\"A Fool and his Money\\" gives an indication of what happened to Rothchild's investment.  As a consequence, at the very end of this book, Rothchild has a short glossary of major investment and stock market terms that he has defined as a result of his experience.  He defines the terms found in this review as follows:<br /><br />(1) Average Investor: born loser<br /><br />(2) Bull Market: a time when your neighbor's stocks are going up<br /><br />(3) Successful investor: liar<br /><br />(4) Inside information: something you wish they'd tell you; what everybody else has heard<br /><br />(5) Stockbroker: salesperson for stocks, mutual funds, etc.; a person who will never go broke<br /><br />(6) Money manager: expert who manages your financial affairs; someone to whom you pay a large fee so you'll have less money to manage<br /><br />(7) Hot stock: stock everybody is buying; what your brokerage firm calls any stock it wants to sell<br /><br />(8) Irrational market: a market that isn't doing what you want it too; every market<br /><br />(9) Fully-informed investment decision: wild guess<br /><br />(10) Financial security: perpetual care enjoyed by insurance companies, brokers, money managers, and others in the financial security industry.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a practical and hilarious book that serves as a warning to the average investor!!<br /><br />(originally published 1988; acknowledgements; 31 chapters; postscript; glossary; main narrative of 250 pages)<br /><br />+++++has a short glossary of major investment and stock market terms that he has defined as a result of his experience.

It is excellent and I highly recommend reading it carefully before reading the novel itself.  It explains, among other things, how the entire novel is related to existentialism.  Even though not explicitly stated, this introduction also tells us about the nihilistic aspects of this novel.<br /><br />Existentialism is a twentieth-century philosophical movement whose emphasis is upon personal decision to be made in a world without reason and without purpose.  It also emphasizes such things as subjectivity, free will, and individuality.<br />This movement has spawned a form of psychotherapy called existential therapy that is concerned with the present and not with the past or future.<br /><br />Nihilism in philosophy is the denial of existence of any basis for knowledge or truth.  It is the general rejection of customary beliefs in morality, religion, and so on.  As well, it stresses the belief that there is no meaning or purpose to existence.<br /><br />(2) Chronology (4 pages).  Traces in table form the author's life (among other things).  The novel is by Albert Camus (1913 to 1960) who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957.  The novel was first published in 1942 in French and titled \\"The Outsider.\\"  Camus died in a car accident.<br /><br />(3) Translator's Note (2 pages).  The novel was translated from the French by poet and critic Matthew Ward.  Ward states that the \\"'simplicity' of the text is merely apparent and everywhere paradoxical.\\"<br /><br />(4) The Actual Novel (115 pages).  This novel is divided into two nearly equal parts of six and five chapters respectively.<br /><br />Part one details the routine, mechanical nature of the main character's everyday life up to the point where he commits a murder.  In part two we see how the main character is jolted out of his routine life since he now has to stand trial.<br /><br />There are only four major characters in this novel:<br /><br />(1) Meursault.  A Frenchman who is the main character or \\"existentialist hero\\" of the novel.  The entire story is told through his eyes.<br /><br />(2) Maman, Meursault's mother.  She is not a living character but her presence is felt throughout the novel.<br /><br />(3) Raymond, Meursault's friend.  He is indirectly the cause of why Meursault ends up in jail, is convicted of murder, and sentenced to death.<br /><br />(4) Marie, Meursault's girlfriend.  Meursault cares for her, but not in the same way that she cares for him.<br /><br />There are eleven minor characters.  They are all crucial to the story.<br /><br />The writing in the novel is simple and laconic but powerful.  The novel begins with the following: \\"Maman died today.  Or maybe yesterday.  I don't know.\\"  It ends with the following: \\"I...only...wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.\\"<br /><br />The themes or topics that run throughout the novel are many.  Some of these are as follows:<br /><br />Death, detachment, indifference, observation, alienation, spiritual exhaustion, apathy, absurdity, callousness, immorality, unemotionalism, and ambiguity.<br /><br />I should warn potential readers of this novel that those unfamiliar with and that do not understand the concepts of existentialism and nihilism may respond with anger towards this novel.  All the one and two star reviews below this review illustrate this.  What this means is that Camus did a good job in writing his novel.<br /><br />What I did was take a word or a phrase from the first five, one and two star reviews below this one.  These words describe existentialism and/or nihilism and express anger.

(Comprises 4 pages.)  Allport was formerly a professor of psychology at Harvard.  It was mainly through his efforts that Frankl's work was introduced to North America.  Here he highlights key aspects of Frankl's book.  I agree with him when he says:<br /><br />\\"A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity [of spending three years at Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps] is a psychiatrist worth listening to.  He, if anyone, should be able to view our human condition wisely and with compassion.\\"<br /><br />(2) A recent preface by Frankl where he discusses his book (first published in German in 1946) and other significant matters. (3 pages.)  He states the true intention of his book:<br /><br />\\"I...wanted simply to convey to the reader by way of concrete example that life holds a potential meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable ones.\\"<br /><br />(3) Frankl's actual book. (130 pages.)  It consists of two parts, \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\" and \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" respectively.  (Logotherapy was the psychotherapy developed by Frankl.)  More of this division will be explained<br />below.<br /><br />(4) A postscript by Frankl written in 1983 entitled \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism.\\"  (15 pages.)  This section is very interesting. By tragic optimism Frankl \\"means that one...remains optimistic in spite of [tragedy].\\"  He goes on to state that \\"[t]his chapter...raises the question, `How is it possible to say yes to life in spite of [overwhelming tragedy]?'\\"  Even though I disagree with certain parts, it still is packed with wisdom and facts.  My favorite piece of information from this section:<br /><br />\\"Austrian...pollsters recently reported that those held in highest esteem by most...people interviewed are neither...great artists nor...great scientists, neither...great statesmen nor...great sports figures, but those who master a hard lot [or hard circumstances] with their head held high.\\"<br /><br />(5) An extensive bibliography of Logotherapy.  (40 pages.)<br /><br />Part one (consisting of 85 pages) of Frankl's actual two part book begins with the following:<br /><br />\\"This book does not claim to be an account of facts and events but of [my] personal experiences...It is the inside story [or autobiographical story] of a concentration camp, told by one of its survivors.\\"<br /><br />And what a story it is!!  This story is not concerned with great horrors (well-documented in other books) but \\"with the multitude of small torments\\" that were endured.  Not only does Frankl relate his experiences, but he also details his observations and conclusions based on those observations.  He also imparts to the reader his wisdom (not all of which I agree with).  Four of my favorite wise sayings that he imparts are:<br /><br />(1)  \\"An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.\\"<br />(2)  \\"Suffering is [a]...part of life, even as fate and death.  Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\\"<br />(3) \\"Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\\"<br />(4) \\"No one has the right to do harm, not even if wrong has been done to them.\\"<br /><br />He also passes on to his readers philosophical truths.  Two of my favorites come from the philosopher Nietzsche:<br /><br />(1) \\"He who has a WHY to live for can bear almost any HOW.\\"<br />(2) \\"That which does not kill [or destroy] me, makes me stronger.\\"<br /><br />Part two (35 pages) introduces the reader to \\"logotherapy,\\" the theory of psychotherapy developed by Frankl from his experiences in the concentration camp (that were outlined in part one).<br /><br />\\"Logotherapy...focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on [a person's] search for such meaning.\\"  Thus, Frankl \\"speak[s] of a will to meaning in contrast to...the will to pleasure on which Freudian psychoanalysis is centered, as well as in contrast to the will to power on which Adlerian psychology...is focused.\\"<br /><br />This part is not difficult to understand and is simply written.  Here, Frankl again imparts his wisdom to the reader (not all of which I agree with).  Two of my favorite wise sayings are:<br /><br />(1)  \\"[A person] should not ask what the meaning of life is, but rather [that person] must recognize that it is he [or she] who is asked.\\"<br />(2) \\"The meaning of life always changes, but...it never ceases to be.\\"<br /><br />This part consists of about twenty small, easy-to-read sections.  Examples of the titles of these sections include:<br /><br />(1) The Will to Meaning<br />(2) The Meaning of Life<br />(3) The Essence of Existence<br />(4) The Meaning of Suffering<br />(5) The Meaning of Love<br /><br />In conclusion, read this life-transforming book and discover for yourself why it has been translated into more than twenty languages, why it has seen nearly one hundred printings in English, and why it is, according to the Library of Congress, \\"One of the ten most influential books in America!!!\\"<br /><br />+++++istence as well as on [a person's] search for such meaning.\\"  Thus, Frankl \\"speak[s] of a will to meaning in contrast to...the will to pleasure on which Freudian psychoanalysis is centered, as well as in contrast to the will to power on which Adlerian psychology...is focused.\\"<br /><br />This part is not difficult to understand and is simply written.

(Other readers may find other parts to this unique book.)  For such a slim book (that I finished reading in two sittings), I was amazed at just how much I learned about and from this courageous person.<br /><br />This book is not only for those with spinal cord injuries.  It can be used effectively by those with other physical types of problems as well as those with emotional problems.  It can also be read by those who want only to read an inspirational book by someone attempting to overcome large obstacles.<br /><br />Reeve does not give direct advice but what he does is allow us to read about his learning experiences and then, form our own conclusions.<br /><br />Why did I decide to read this book?  Two major reasons:<br /><br />(1) I read a quotation (not in this book) by Reeve.  He states:<br /><br />\\"A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.\\"<br /><br />(2) Reeve's several accomplishments AFTER his spinal cord injury (again not stated in this book).  Some highlights include the following:<br /><br />(i) a 1997 Emmy<br />(ii) a 1999 Grammy<br />(iii) a 1999 Screen Actor Guild Award for best actor<br />(iv) a 1997 Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame<br />(v) acting in two movies<br />(vi) directing two movies<br />(vii) the establishment of the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation in 1999<br />(viii) the establishment of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Resource Centre in 2002 {Note that Dana was his wife since 1992}<br />(ix)  the author of two books (this one and one in 1998).<br /><br />These are only a few of his many, many accomplishments.  Visit his internet site to learn about more accomplishments.<br /><br />Thus I thought to myself, \\"This guy is on to something!!\\"<br /><br />This book consists of nine chapters.  Since there is no indication that you have to read the book in the chapter order indicated in the table of contents, I read these chapters in a slightly different order.  These chapters are as follows:<br /><br />(1) THE FIRST DECISION.  Gives in surprising detail the cause, anatomy, and emotional experience of Reeve's spinal cord injury.  (The accident occurred at \\"three o'clock on May 27, 1995.\\")  Reeve tells us at how he arrived at the answer to the question posed by Hamlet: \\"To be or not to be?  That is the question!\\"<br /><br />(2) HUMOR.  This was a coping mechanism Reeve eventually used to deal with his injury.  He tells us that \\"Inside...I was angry to my very core\\" right after his accident.  Humor helped quell this anger.  Look for the antics of his friend Robin Williams (who shared an apartment with Reeve when they were both starting out).<br /><br />(3) MIND/BODY.  This was another coping mechanism.  Reeve's theme for this inspirational chapter is his belief that \\"there is a relationship between the mind and the body that can both create a physical condition and enable us to recover from it.\\"<br /><br />(4) RELIGION (presented in the book as chapter 5).  Reeve tells us, \\"The truth is that I only found a religion very recently that I can reconcile with a lifelong quest for the meaning of spiritually.\\"  This is a very frank and honest chapter that some readers may not appreciate.  I, however, found it refreshing that he spoke so candidly about a subject that, for some reason, you're not supposed to speak candidly about.  This chapter is continued in the next chapter.<br /><br />(5) FAITH (presented as chapter 8).  Continues the search begun in chapter 4 \\"to discover the relevance of spirituality.\\"  Reeve finally finds a religion and uses this as another coping mechanism.  Again, as with the chapter on religion, this is an honest and candid chapter that I found refreshing to read.<br /><br />(6) HOPE (presented as the last chapter, chapter 9).  Hope can only be realized through effort.  Thus Reeve tells us that \\"Since 1997 I have worked closely with [politicians] on health care reform, rights of the disabled, and increased funding for biomedical research.\\"  This chapter concludes with an essay written by Reeve about hope entitled \\"The Lighthouse.\\"  Hope is another coping mechanism he used.<br /><br />(7) ADVOCACY (presented as chapter 6).  It tells us how Reeve began \\"defining [his] role as an advocate for research [especially stem cell research] and [improving] the quality of life for people with disabilities [by, for example, advocating increased health and disability insurance].\\"  Here we learn more about science and politics.<br /><br />(8) RECOVERY (presented as chapter 7).  By late 2000, Reeve had some surprises regarding his condition.  He states, \\"[There have been] three...significant milestones in my history as a spinal cord patient.  The first was discovering that my injury was not complete; the second was finding out that I could breath on my own, if only for short periods of time, [and third] the ability to initiate movement.\\"  As a consequence, his hope increased and his advocacy work increased.<br /><br />(9) PARENTING (presented as chapter 4).  Reeve had three children, two sons and one daughter.  We discover through him how it is possible to be a good parent despite having a severe disability.<br /><br />The only minor weakness with this book is the chapter order.  However, I easily overcame this problem and established a pattern that works for me.  Thus, to recap the above, I read this nine chapter book in the following chapter order:<br /><br />{1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7, 4}<br /><br />Finally and sadly, Reeve died recently (from causes not directly related to his injury).  He is survived by his parents, one brother, two half brothers, one half sister, his wife, and his three children.<br /><br />In conclusion, Reeve portrayed the \\"Man of Steel\\" in the 1978 movie \\"Superman, The Movie\\" (his first movie that won him a Most Promising Newcomer award).  In the years after his injury, he transcended this title to become the \\"Man of Courage and Action.\\"  Be sure to read this book to learn the final inspirational thoughts of Christopher Reeve (September 1952 to October 2004)!!<br /><br />(first published 2002; 180 pages; acknowledgements; 9 chapters; photos throughout; about the author; about the photographer who is his son Matt Reeve)<br /><br />+++++n only be realized through effort.

The line distinguishing investment, financial speculation, and even gambling is not absolutely clear:<br /><br />\\"[S]peculation is the name given to a failed investment and...investment is the name given to a successful speculation...The psychologies of speculation and gambling are almost indistinguishable: both are dangerously addictive habits which involve an appeal to fortune, and often [are] accompanied by delusional behavior and are dependent on success for the control of emotions.\\"<br /><br />The title of this book \\"Devil take the Hindmost\\" comes from a phrase in the 1720 writing of an \\"anonymous pamphleteer.\\"  This phrase means \\"Let every person follow self-interest, leaving others to fare as they may.\\"<br /><br />Chancellor takes us through significant periods of stock market manias or \\"speculative manias or  bubbles.\\"  Some examples include:<br /><br />(1) the Dutch Tulip Mania of 1637<br />(2) the British South Sea Company Bubble of 1720<br />(3) the U.S. bull market of the 1920s<br />(4) the U.S. bull market of the 1980s<br />(5) the Japanese Bubble Economy of the late 1980s.<br /><br />All of the above events have one thing in common: the mania is always followed by a collapse, or more eloquently, the bubble eventually bursts.  But as you read this book, you will discover that investors and speculators don't seem to learn from the lessons of the past.  Why?  Because as Sir John Templeton stated, there is this manic belief that \\"this time it's different.\\"<br /><br />Throughout this book, you'll come across words such as these:<br /><br />mania or euphoria, bubble, crash or collapse, suicide, lotteries, gambling, speculation, irrationality, political influence, corruption, fraud, bankruptcies, bank failures, greed, profit, wealth, power, illness, anxiety, nervous breakdown, insider trading, capitalists, materialism, risk, murder, debt, and market manipulation.<br /><br />Chancellor also provides other interesting historical information in his narrative besides just historical information about speculation.  For example, he tells us the true story of where the stock market terms \\"bull\\" and \\"bear\\" came from and what Mark Twain thought about investing and speculation.<br /><br />Contrary to belief, this book is not biased.  In the epilogue of his book, Chancellor tells us the benefits that come from speculation.  However, from reading the initial chapters of this book, it seems to me that these benefits come at a very high human cost.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this book is the plethora of footnotes.  They occur on every second page or so.  While some of the information in these were very interesting, I found that I got tired of being continually distracted by these footnotes and so I eventually gave up reading them.<br /><br />Although not completely necessary, it would be helpful to know some basics about the stock market and investment when reading this book.  Chancellor does a good job explaining most things but he also assumes that the reader knows some basics.<br /><br />Finally, this is a unique book that thoroughly explains the history of financial speculation.  Whether you're an investor or not, you'll learn a lot especially about human nature.<br /><br />RECOMENDATION: Invest in this book!!<br /><br />(first published 1999; preface;  9 chapters; epilogue; notes; references, acknowledgements; index)<br /><br />+++++ialism, risk, murder, debt, and market manipulation.<br /><br />Chancellor also provides other interesting historical information in his narrative besides just historical information about speculation.

US	45789111	R28QQMC80RH16G	0393320979	481105340	Beowulf: A New Verse Translation (Bilingual Edition)	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A Poem of EPIC Proportions!!!	+++++<br /><br />\\"Beowulf\\" (pronounced \\"Beh-ah-woolf\\") is an Anglo-Saxon epic poem written in Old English where three critical things are unknown:<br /><br />(1) Who wrote it<br />(2) Why it was written<br />(3) When it was composed.  (Today, it is thought to have been composed between the seventh and tenth centuries A.D. making it the oldest existing poem in the English language.  Also, it's thought that the poem was written in England but the events it describes are set in Scandinavia.)<br /><br />As a social and historical document, this poem reflects a feudal, newly Christian world of heroes & monsters, blood & victory, and death.  But as a work of art, it has a beauty, power, and artistry that's intrigued readers for over a millennium.  Some of the poem's themes are duty, honor, man against nature, and the glory of combat in the service of God.<br /><br />I think there are four reasons why this poem and in particular Seamus Heaney's (Irish born: 1939) translation of it are so popular:<br /><br />(1) Heaney is a world-renowned poet and Nobel Laureate known for his strong, classically-infused verse.  (Heaney won the 1995 Nobel Prize in literature \\"for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past.\\")<br /><br />(2) This poem is a dark, blood stained adventure that can be said to be a major influence to J.R.R. Toiken's popular \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series.<br /><br />(3) The book's cover.  Never before has the back of someone's head covered in chain mail evoked such things as curiosity, fortitude, intrigue, and wonderment.<br /><br />(4) The poem's shortness.  This poem is almost 3200 lines long and, with Heaney's capable translation that's not stiff and scholarly, can be easily read in one or two sittings.<br /><br />This book has the poem as it was originally written in Old English on the left page and Heaney's translation on the right page.  The lines in Old English correspond to the translated lines on the right page.  Heaney's verse is straight forward and features marginal notes that help to indicate transitions of scene thus making his translation easy to follow.<br /><br />I found that there is something intriguing, mysterious, and fascinating about reading lines in Old English such as:<br /><br />Him pa ellen-rof andswarode,<br />wlanc Wedera leod, word aefter spraec,<br />heard under helme: \\"We synt Higelaces<br />beod-geneatas; Beowulf is min nama.\\"<br />(lines 340 to 343)<br /><br />and knowing that some unknown voice of the distant past was saying:<br /><br />The man whose name was known for courage,<br />the Geat leader, resolute in his helmet,<br />answered in return: \\"We are retainers<br />from Hygelac's band.  Beowulf is my name.\\"<br />(The marginal note states, \\"Beowulf announces his name.\\")<br /><br />In the above translation, the \\"Geats\\" are one of the three dynasties in this poem.  They were a people of southern Sweden.  \\"Hygelac\\" was a king of the Geats and Beowulf's uncle.  \\"Beowulf\\" is Hygelac's nephew, a Scandinavian prince, and a great warrior.  Later he becomes King of the Geats.  He is the hero of the poem.<br /><br />The book includes a long, detailed, interesting \\"Introduction\\" by Heaney that orientates the reader to the poem.  As well, there is a section entitled \\"About this Translation,\\" again by Heaney.  (This important section, for some unknown reason, is not indicated in the book's Table of Contents.)  Purists and scholars especially should read this section to understand (before they start criticizing) why Heaney wrote this translation in the way he did.<br /><br />Finally, to get the full impact of this poem as originally experienced, I recommend, after reading the poem at least once, listening to the compact disc or cassette (originally broadcast on BBC Radio) where \\"unabridged selections\\" of this poem's translation are read by Heaney himself.  (Note that the entire poem on CD or cassette is abridged but the selections that are read are unabridged.)  Why do I recommend this?  Because this poem is \\"not meant to be read...but to be heard.\\"  (Alternatively, you can have someone read the poem to you or read the poem out loud to<br />yourself.)<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an old epic poem of war and adventure translated and read aloud by a Nobel-winning poet.  Don't miss this adventure!!<br /><br />(paperback edition published 2001; introduction;  section about this translation; a note on the names in the poem; the original and translated poem comprise 215 pages; family trees of the 3 dynasties mentioned in the poem; acknowledgements.<br />CD published 2000; 2 discs; 2 hr 15 min)<br /><br />+++++ged.)

That is the Question!	+++++<br /><br />(Note: this review is for the book \\"Fahrenheit 451: The 50th Anniversary Edition\\" published by Del Rey in 2003.)<br /><br />This particular book has five sections:<br /><br />(1) The actual novel by Ray Bradbury that was first published in 1953 (165 pages).<br />(2) An \\"Afterward\\" written by the author in 1982 (7 pages).<br />(3) A \\"Coda\\" (a section that reinforces the novel's conclusion) written by the author in 1979 (5 pages).<br />(4) An interview with the author in 2003 entitled \\"A Conversation with Ray Bradbury\\" (11 pages).<br />(5) \\"About the Author\\" or a brief biography of Ray Bradbury, born 1920 (1 page).<br /><br />This novel is a dystopian science fiction novel.  (A \\"dystopia\\" is any society considered to be undesirable; the opposite of a utopia.)  It is set in a world where books are banned and burned and, as well, where critical thought is discouraged.  The novel's title refers to the ignition temperature of paper.  (The ignition temperature is the temperature at which something catches fire and burns on its own.)  For paper, this temperature is 451 degrees Fahrenheit (or 233 degrees Celsius).<br /><br />What's eerie about this novel is that, even though it was written more than fifty years ago, it seems to be predicting what is beginning in our society.<br /><br />The novel itself is divided into three parts.  (There are no chapters.)  These parts are entitled:<br /><br />(1) The Hearth and Salamander<br />(2) The Sieve and the Sand<br />(3) Burning Bright<br /><br />There are only five major characters in this novel:<br /><br />(1) Guy Montag: is the protagonist of the story.  He is a \\"fireman\\" (or more precisely a book burner) who realizes that the world is wasting away because people live only to be entertained.  Montag eventually begins collecting books by stealing them instead of burning them.<br />(2) Mildred Montag: Guy's wife whose only purpose in life is watching television.  She is very unhappy (but doesn't realize it).<br />(3) Clarisse: the unusual girl who lives next door to Guy.  She refuses the entertainment of society and is a free thinker who enjoys the outdoors and family conversations.  She informs Montag that there's more to life than burning books and watching television.<br />(4) Captain Beatty: the fire chief for whom Montag works.  He is the villain of the novel.<br />(5) Faber: a retired English professor.  When Montag needs help understanding what he reads in his stolen books, he turns to this professor.<br /><br />There are a few minor characters in the novel.  The most significant are a small group of \\"outlaws.\\"  Their crime: being scholars who read books in the past.<br /><br />This novel might be considered a social commentary that predicts what may happen in the future.  Some themes that run through it are as follows:<br /><br />(1) the use of fear to control<br />(2) the dangers of indifference<br />(3) the dangers of censorship<br />(4) the importance of free speech<br />(5) the importance of the individual.<br /><br />The afterword is interesting and is where Bradbury talks about his love of books and writers.  As well, he revisits some of the main characters in this novel.<br /><br />The coda explains how some publishers have tried to censor some aspects of this novel.  This got Bradbury very angry and he states, \\"There is more than one way to burn a book.  And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.\\"<br /><br />In the interview with Bradbury, many intriguing things are discussed.  I found Bradbury's critique of the 1966 movie based on this novel interesting.  I learned that a new movie based on this novel will be coming out soon.  I also admire Bradbury even more when he states, \\"Reading is the center of our lives.  The library is our brain.  Without the library, you have no civilization.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the cover of this book is of special significance.  It is the original cover of the 1953 hardcover book showing a person covered in printed paper with books (presumably that he's/she's read) at his/her feet.  The person and the books are shown set ablaze.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a short, fascinating book that really makes you think about the future of society!!<br /><br />(Originally published 1953; this particular book published 2003; 3 parts;  main narrative of 165 pages; afterword; coda; interview with author)<br /><br />+++++nted paper with books (presumably that he's/she's read) at his/her feet.

What exactly was this vision or idea?  Answer: The calculation and subsequent quantification of risk.  That is, they attempted to manage risk.  \\"The capacity to manage risk, and with it the appetite to take risk and make forward-looking choices, are key elements...that drive the economic system forward.\\"<br /><br />\\"[T]he stock market and the bond market are natural laboratories for the study of risk because they lend themselves so readily to quantification.\\"  Thus there will be some discussion of stocks and bonds.<br /><br />This easy-to-read book has five parts--<br /><br />Part 1, two chapters (up to the year 1200):<br /><br />Tells us how the modern conception of risk is rooted in the Hindu-Arabic numbering system that reached the West seven to eight hundred years ago.<br /><br />Part 2, three chapters (between the years 1200 and 1700):<br /><br />Describes how a serious study of risk began during the Renaissance period, \\"when people broke loose from the constraints of the past and subjected long-held beliefs to open challenge.\\"  By the mid-1600s, the \\"theory of probability\\" was discovered, a theory which is \\"the mathematical heart of the concept of risk.\\"<br /><br />Part 3, six chapters (between the years 1700 and 1900):<br /><br />By this time, mathematicians transformed probability theory from a \\"gambler's toy\\" into a major instrument for organizing, interpreting, and applying information.  Quantitative techniques of risk management gradually emerged that \\"have helped trigger the tempo of modern times.\\"  During this time you get the development of such things as:<br /><br />Life expectancy tables; life annuities; the Law of Large Numbers; statistical sampling; the normal or \\"bell\\" curve; standard deviation; the Law of Averages; the groundwork for modern principles of investment management; and  regression to the mean.<br /><br />Part 4, four chapters (between the years 1900 and 1960):<br /><br />At this point \\"uncertainty, and its handmaiden luck\\" are discussed.  The concepts encountered in this part never occurred to the mathematicians and philosophers of the past since they were too busy establishing the laws of probability to \\"tackle the mysteries of uncertainty.\\"  Included in this part is a good discussion of game theory and how to measure risk when investing in securities.  All theories discussed in this part are called \\"models of rationality.\\"<br /><br />Part 5, four chapters:<br /><br />This part continues discussing the concept of uncertainty.  Here there are examples of how the results of the models of rationality depart from what actually occurs in reality. Included is more discussion of securities such as stocks and bonds, and new discussions of derivatives (such as stock options) and volatility.<br /><br />At the end of this book, Bernstein sums up his entire book:<br /><br />\\"The central theme of this whole story is that the quantitative achievements of the [historical figures] we have met [in this book] shaped the trajectory of progress over the past [centuries].  In engineering, medicine, science, finance, business, and even in government, decisions that touch everyone's life are made in accordance with disciplined procedures that far outperform the seat-of-the-pants methods of the past.  Many catastrophic errors of judgment are thus either avoided, or else their consequences are muted.\\"<br /><br />Along the way, Bernstein passes along little tidbits of wisdom.  For example, \\"you cannot expect to make large profits without taking the risk of large losses.\\"<br /><br />One of my favorite sections in this book is when the author does an in-depth statistical analysis of the stock market by using the results of five hundred stocks from January 1926 through to December 1995.  His analysis leads to a conclusion thatmost rational people are intuitively aware of: \\"The stock market is a risky place!\\"<br /><br />Be aware that this book is not an investment cookbook that gives the reader step-by-step instructions of how to invest in the stock market.  Also, this book is not exclusively about investment risk.  As well, this book is not a textbook.<br /><br />Throughout the book are pictures, tables, charts, and graphs to aid in the discussion.  I found these helpful.<br /><br />The only weakness I found was that some explanations especially numerical explanations were not clear and were too wordy.  At these points, diagrams would have benefited the explanations, making them less wordy, and easier to follow.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book details the fascinating story of risk.  You'll find \\"that [this] story helps define what it means to be a human being!!\\"<br /><br />**** 1/2<br /><br />(first published 1996; acknowledgements; introduction; 19 chapters; main narrative of 330 pages; (foot)notes; bibliography, name and subject index)<br /><br />+++++most rational people are intuitively aware of: \\"The stock market is a risky place!\\"<br /><br />Be aware that this book is not an investment cookbook that gives the reader step-by-step instructions of how to invest in the stock market.

Generally, Wolf outlines other Gothic novels beginning with the first English Gothic novel published in 1764, then discusses Stoker's novel, and finally ends with a filmography beginning with the first vampire movie in 1922.<br /><br />The actual plot of this novel is simple.  Dracula decides to move from Transylvania (where he resides at \\"Castle Dracula\\") to London, England so as to feed on fresh prey.  A small group of humans in London learn what he is and decide to destroy him.<br /><br />This novel has eight major characters (of which six are male and two are female).  Two of the most interesting are as follows:<br /><br />(1) \\"Count Dracula\\": a Transylvanian vampire who has been feeding off the blood of peasants for centuries.  He is the greatest vampire and leader of the undead, who in life had been a man of legend.  Now he is a monster with a unique combination of supernatural powers and extraordinary human characteristics that make him a threat to humans everywhere.  (Wolf tells us that \\"Dracula\\" means \\"dragon\\" in Romanian.)<br /><br />(2) \\"Dr. Abraham Van Helsing\\": A philosopher and metaphysician and, as well, one of the most advanced scientists of his time.  He is the first to discover what Dracula is.<br /><br />There are many minor characters in this novel.  The most significant one is \\"R.M. Renfield.\\"  He is an inmate at an insane asylum and refers to Dracula as \\"Master.\\"<br /><br />This book is a horror novel overall but constant themes run throughout it.  The main ones are as follows:<br /><br />(1) friendship<br />(2) religion (and religious duty)<br />(3) sexuality<br />(4) superstition.<br /><br />The actual writing in this novel is extraordinary.  One of my favourite quotations is as follows:<br /><br />\\"When the Count saw my face [which had a fresh cut from shaving], his eyes blazed with a sort of demonic fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat.  I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads [that] held the crucifix.  It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\\"<br /><br />The cover of this particular book is interesting.  It shows a picture of Castle Dracula in Transylvania.  It is the Count's home and base of power.<br /><br />Finally, I had two minor problems with this novel:<br /><br />First, there is a chapter where Van Helsing mentions all of Dracula's powers.  I found that one important power that's unique to Dracula himself (and unknown to most movie viewers) is not mentioned.<br />Second, I found the conclusion of this novel somewhat weak as compared to its riveting beginning.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's true what the back cover of this particular book states: \\"[This is] a novel of peculiar power, of hypnotic fascination.  The reader is warned that he [or she] who enters Castle Dracula may not escape its...spell, even when he [or she] closes this book.\\"  Be sure to read this book to learn the true story of the leader of the undead!!<br /><br />(first published 1897;  this particular book published 1997;  biography;  introduction;  27 chapters;  actual story 370 pages)<br /><br />+++++as follows:<br /><br />(1) friendship<br />(2) religion (and religious duty)<br />(3) sexuality<br />(4) superstition.<br /><br />The actual writing in this novel is extraordinary.

In book two containing part two entitled \\"The Purgatorio,\\"  Dante ascends the mountain of Purgatory where there is purification of sin.  In this book (book three), Dante ascends to Heaven to experience \\"the Love that moves the Sun and the other stars.\\"<br /><br />Dante begins this part of his journey by stating the following:<br /><br />\\"Whatever portion time<br /><br />still leaves me of the treasure of that kingdom<br /><br />shall now become the subject of my rhyme.\\"<br /><br />Dante is saying that in the time left to him, the subject of this part of his \\"rhyme\\" or poem will be \\"that kingdom\\" of  heavenly Paradise.<br /><br />There is an introduction by Professor John Freccero.  (We are not told what university he's associated with.)  He does a good job of highlighting key aspects of this poem.<br /><br />The late John Ciardi, former poet and professor at Rutgers and Harvard universities, translated this poem from its original 1300's Italian into English.  He states that he has translated this poem for one major reason: for \\"the pleasure of a beginning student reading in translation.\\"  The poem's translation, he admits, is not over-scholarly.  Scholars and purists may thus not appreciate Ciardi's translation.  I, however, enjoyed his rhyming translation.<br /><br />Dante's heavenly Paradise is based on an Earth-centered model of nine spheres (individually called \\"heavens\\").  Going outward from the Earth, they are as follows:<br /><br />(1) the Moon<br /><br />(2) Mercury<br /><br />(3) Venus<br /><br />(4) the Sun<br /><br />(5) Mars<br /><br />(6) Jupiter<br /><br />(7) Saturn<br /><br />(8) the Fixed Stars<br /><br />(9) Primum Mobile (Prime Mover)<br /><br />The Prime Mover is the sphere that contains the divine power to move these heavenly bodies.  Beyond the Prime Mover is the Empyrean (pronounced \\"Em-pi-reen\\").  The Empyrean is God's realm of pure light and is Dante's final destination.<br /><br />Thus, this heavenly paradise that Dante travels through consists of ten parts that comprise thirty-three episodes (or \\"cantos\\").<br /><br />Unlike parts one and two, Dante takes the majority of this final journey with his guide and former love Beatrice.  Along the way, the travelers and the reader encounter such things as biblical figures and references, philosophers, people of Dante's time, legends, saints, and angels.<br /><br />As with parts one and two, this part is a narrative poem whose greatest strength lies in the fact it does not so much narrate as dramatize its episodes.  It is a visual work that sparks your imagination.<br /><br />Ciardi's mini-summary in italics before each episode gives the reader a glimpse of what to expect in a particular episode.  His (foot)notes at the end of each episode highlight our understanding of key passages within each.  For me, Ciardi's mini-summaries and notes that accompany each episode are the cornerstone to understanding what Dante was attempting to convey.  As well, Dante can be challenging and tedious to read at times.  These mini-summaries and notes help the reader meet the challenge and overcome the tedium.<br /><br />There are three illustrations in this book.  They increase the understanding of and add another visual dimension to the poem.<br /><br />I should mention the impressive art on the cover of this book.  It has a reproduction of the 1825 painting by William Blake showing Dante in the Empyrean.  It has a river called the River of Light.  Dante is shown drinking from this river.<br /><br />It is possible to read this part without reading the first two parts.  However, to experience the full impact of this part, I would recommend reading the first two parts first before reading this part.<br /><br />The only noticeable problem I had with this book is that it did not have a diagram of the heavenly Paradise to help the reader know beforehand where this journey was going.  The first two parts have these helpful diagrams.<br /><br />Finally, as I mentioned, this is a very imaginative poem.  Thus, I recommend \\"The Dore Illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy\\" (1976) by Gustave Dore.  This book will add another vivid visual dimension to the poem.<br /><br />In conclusion, don't miss this final phase of Dante's amazing journey.  This brilliant translation allows the reader to experience what Dante was attempting to convey when he wrote this poem almost seven centuries ago!!<br /><br />(published 2001;  acknowledgements of translator;  introduction;  33 cantos; poem, canto mini-summaries, and canto (foot)notes comprise 345 pages; 3 illustrations)<br /><br />+++++rst two parts.

This part consists of chapters one to seven.  It is here that the possible answers to the riddles of the compass are explored.<br />2.  The next part consists of chapters eight to eleven.  It attempts to answer the riddle of how the compass became known throughout the world.  Here, the \\"Great Age of Exploration\\" is examined where \\"Columbus, da Gama, Magellan, [Cook], and other Spanish and Portuguese navigators conquered the oceans.\\"<br />3. The last part consists of chapter twelve.  It states the author's conclusions and summarizes chapters one to eleven.<br /><br />This book is very easy to read and thus is a fast read.  There are illustrations throughout it.  Personally, I learned a lot from this slim book.<br /><br />People who like concrete answers will probably not enjoy this book.  Why?  Because much about the compass is unknown and \\"shrouded in mystery.\\"  Thus, what Aczel has done is gather the best evidence he could from \\"books, manuscripts, and pamphlets of specialized academic circulation\\" some of which were written \\"hundreds of years ago\\" and \\"often written in Italian, French, or German\\" (of which he had to translate).  From this mass of material, he drew certain inferences and conclusions.<br /><br />The author briefly mentions the navigational chronometer and refers the reader to the excellent book by Dava Sobel entitled \\"Longitude\\" (1995).  Interested readers may also want to check out the book entitled \\"The Illustrated Longitude\\" (1998).<br /><br />Finally, there were a few problems I had with this book:<br /><br />1. The book's title.  Some readers may try to look for a single riddle.  This book is not about a riddle but about a series of riddles or better still, mysteries.  Thus, a better title might be \\"The Riddles of the Compass\\" or \\"The Mysteries of the Compass.\\"<br /><br />2. The author includes a diagram that has the caption \\"How the magnetic compass works.\\"  Actually, what is depicted is the Earth's magnetic lines of force.  The author explains that the Earth's magnetic poles have a different location than its geographical poles.  Yet, the diagram shows the magnetic lines of force running from the Earth's geographic North Pole to its geographic South Pole.  Why?<br /><br />3. There is a chapter on Marco Polo and his navigational journeys.  The author states that Polo said nothing about the compass in his writings.  Thus, I could not understand why this chapter was included.<br /><br />4.  The author tells us that he did not list all his footnote sources.  In a work of this nature, I felt he should of (even though there was a \\"large number of sources used and...these materials are not accessible to most readers\\").<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good, solid,concise story about the compass.  Once you read this book, you will agree with the author when he says that the compass is \\"the invention that changed the world.\\"<br /><br />(first published 2001;  preface;  12 chapters;  main narrative 160 pages;  illustrated;  references;  acknowledgements;  index)<br /><br />+++++concise story about the compass.

As well, this book \\"attempts to bring together different fields of economic analysis (such as the impact of technological change, the evolution of financial markets, and Third World development) which are all too often considered in isolation from each other.\\"<br /><br />This book also \\"steps beyond the confines of economics to consider [other factors such as] the cultural, ethical, and geopolitical ramifications of...capitalist development.\\"  In other words, this book considers the human side of capitalistic economics and does not only concentrate on economic principles and market forces.  Too often books on economics (especially basic economic books) concentrate only on economic principles without even considering the human element.  The result is that everything appears well on a theoretical economic basis but the majority of people who have to survive in a particular economy are having difficulty.<br /><br />Before jumping into the main thrust of the book, there is an introduction that caught my eye immediately.  Here, Shutt mentions three reasons as to why the claims that the capitalistic free market system is the best may not be true despite what \\"official propaganda\\" and rhetoric tells us.  He ends his introduction with this startling statement:<br /><br />\\"As failure to resolve the world's profound economic distortions gives rise to more and more symptoms of social breakdown and civil strife in every continent, the need to focus wider public attention on their causes and effects has never been more pressing.\\"<br /><br />Shutt's journey on the origin of capitalism takes the reader to such highlights as the Industrial Revolution, the span from the 1920's economic boom and the 1930's Depression, World War Two, the postwar years, and the Soviet collapse. It ends in the present.<br /><br />The majority of this book becomes an analysis of how bad things have become thanks to such things as capitalist profit maximizing; globalization; privatization; deregulation; leverage buyouts; hostile takeover mergers; monetarism (theory which holds that economic stability and growth result from maintaining a steady rate of growth in the supply of money); \\"creative\\" accounting; redundant excess capital; fraud; corruption; organized crime; and the biggest problem of them all -- sluggish economic growth.<br /><br />The last chapter of this book is the best.  It reveals the author's profound main conclusion: the maximization of profit will cease to be the main basis of allocating resources.<br /><br />What I found interesting about this book since it was published in 1998 is that many of the problems it discusses have increased.  In fact, a few new ones have been added.<br /><br />Included in this book are a few tables and graphs to aid in the analysis.  At the end of each chapter are (foot)notes and references.<br /><br />There are three problems I found with this book:<br /><br />First, there is no glossary.  Economic terms are presented but not defined.  Thus, a glossary would have been of great value.<br /><br />Second, chapters three to ten in this fourteen chapter book are discussed in an overly scholarly manner requiring one to have an above-average vocabulary.  I managed to get through these chapters but some readers may find these chapters tedious.  However, chapters one, two, and eleven to fourteen are relatively easy to comprehend.<br /><br />Lastly, the author gives the impression that thecapitalist system is on a continual decline leading to a major breakdown.  Perhaps this will occur but Shutt gives no account of the resilience of the capitalistic economic system.  For example, crises often lead to reforms that strengthen the system.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book gives a fairly good account of the problems that need to be fixed in the global capitalistic economic system.  In other words, it shows that all is not well with this system!!<br /><br />(published 1998; about the author;  acknowledgements; introduction; 14 chapters; main narrative of 230 pages; tables and graphs; references; index.)<br /><br />+++++capitalist system is on a continual decline leading to a major breakdown.

Explains what introverts are.  For example, \\"Introverts are like a rechargeable battery.  They need to stop expending energy and rest in order to recharge.\\"<br />2. Discusses what introverts are not.  For example, \\"It's not about disliking people or even being shy.\\"<br />3. Details the biological and physiological basis of introversion and extroversion.<br /><br />PART TWO:<br /><br />4.  Information and techniques for introverts when dealing with relationships including intimate relationships.<br />5.  Information and techniques for introverts when dealing with parenting.<br />6. Practical tips and information for introverts when socializing.<br />7. Tips and information for introverts in the work world.<br /><br />PART THREE:<br /><br />8. Presents concepts that can help \\"you cope with your introversion.\\"<br />9. Presents ways of how to \\"nurture\\" your introvert nature.<br />10. How to become proficient at \\"extroverting.\\"  The basis for this chapter is that \\"there are things introverts have to do that call for some extrovert-like skills.\\"<br /><br />There are five things I really like about this book:<br /><br />First, it is very readable with no technical psychobabble.<br />Next, each chapter ends with a brief summary or what the author calls \\"Points to Ponder.\\"<br />Third, there is a \\"test\\" that has thirty statements.  Its purpose is to determine if you are more introverted or more extroverted.  The ten statements above were derived from this larger thirty-statement test.<br />Fourthly, there are \\"blue boxes\\" (that is, brief sections of interesting information printed on a blue background) throughout the book.  Two of my favorites are the one that lists the names of famous people who are more introverted (for example, Clint Eastwood) and the other lists fictional characters that are more introverted (for example, the super sleuth Hercule Poirot).<br />Lastly, this book has a well-referenced suggested reading list for those that want more detailed information.<br /><br />Part one, in my opinion, is the best section of this book.  I found the chapter on biological and physiological differences between introversion and extroversion very interesting.<br /><br />Part two's chapter on introversion in the employment world was good.  I, however, had problems with chapters four, five, and six which dealt with relationships, parenting, and socializing respectively.  It seemedto me that presenting this information directly after part one was abrupt.  As well, these topics were presented out of sequence.  You have to socialize first so as acquire a relationship and this may lead to marriage and children.  The information presented in these chapters was useful but some of the practical tips presented I found to be unintentionally comical.  Overall, for chapters four, five, and six, I felt that the author was attempting to turn a more introverted person into a more extroverted person.<br /><br />Part three presents information that dealt with coping with introversion.  Some readers may be offended by this especially when they realize that the word \\"cope\\" means to deal with problems or troubles.  Thus, the author is sending a clear message to the reader that introversion is a problem to be overcome and is really not an advantage.  However, if you can ignore this, the information presented is generally useful.<br /><br />Finally, after reading this book, you may desire to read up on the different subtypes of introversion.  (Subtypes of introversion are not presented in this book.)  I have listed the subtype and then beside it a good book on that subtype:<br /><br />1. SOLITARY and CREATIVE: \\"Solitude\\" by A. Storr.<br />2. SHY: \\"Shyness, What it is, What to do about it\\" by P. Zimbardo.<br />3. HIGHLY SENSITIVE: \\"The Highly Sensitive Person\\" by E. Aron.<br />4. WORRIED: \\"The Positive Power of Thinking\\" by J. Norem.<br />5. LONELY: \\"Just Your Type\\" by P. Tieger.<br />6. LONER (by preference): \\"Party of  One\\" by A. Rufus.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good book from which both introverts and extroverts can learn!!<br /><br />(Published 2002; dedication; acknowledgements; preface; introduction; 10 chapters; illustrations; main narrative 310 pages; bibliography; index.)<br /><br />+++++to me that presenting this information directly after part one was abrupt.

California's electricity crisis: how blackouts and higher costs for consumers were the result of the state government's attempt to keep consumer prices artificially<br />low.<br />2. Planned economies: how they may turn decent people into criminals.<br />3. Central planning: how it drove the Soviet economy into the ground and why it doesn't work.<br />4. A free labor market: how it benefits not only the worker but also the economy.<br />5. Price controls: why they fail.<br />6. Geography: the important role it plays in the economies of places around the world.<br />7. Rent control laws: why cities with them have higher rents than cities that don't.<br /><br />If you have wondered about such things as well as other economic matters, then this may be the book for you.<br /><br />This seven chapter (where each chapter averages thirty pages), non-technical, easy-to-read book, by professor and economist Thomas Sowell, has the purpose of focusing on \\"dealing in depth with particular real world problems [and] using economic principles to clarify why and how things have happened the way they have.\\"  The real world economic problems discussed that each have a separate chapter are as follows:<br /><br />(1) medical care<br />(2) housing<br />(3) discrimination<br />(4) development of nations.<br /><br />\\"Because these are political, as well as economic issues, some political principles will need to be considered as well\\" instead of focusing on the above four economic topics in isolation.  Sowell introduces the reader to this idea in his first chapter entitled:<br /><br />(5) Politics versus Economics.<br /><br />As well, \\"neither economics nor politics is just a matter of opinion and both require thinking beyond the immediate consequences of decisions [that is, both require thinking beyond stage one] to their long-term effects.\\"  In other words, economic decisions made to improve a problem may make the problem worse in the long-term if proper thinking has not gone into the initial economic decision.  Thus, most of the chapters indicated above will discuss thinking beyond stage one.<br /><br />I have thus far mentioned five chapters.  There are two more chapters.  One chapter deals with the economics of labor where free labor and labor that's not free are compared.  This chapter is entitled:<br /><br />(6) Free and Unfree Labor.<br /><br />The other chapter is concerned with the economics of insurance where uncertainty and risk are discussed.  This chapter is  entitled:<br /><br />(7) Risky Business.<br /><br />Five of the seven chapters end with an excellent \\"implications\\" section.  This is where Sowell takes what has been previously discussed and draws certain inferences and even conclusions.<br /><br />This book contains no illustrations.  I feel simple diagrams would have been helpful in reducing the book's wordiness.  As well, a summary listing all the economic principles that were applied in each chapter (perhaps at the end of each chapter) would have been helpful, especially for those unfamiliar with such principles.<br /><br />Finally, even though I disagreed with Sowell on some issues (such as on safety movements), I still feel that this is a good book that shows how certain economic principles are applied to some basic but important economic issues.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an excellent, solidly written book suitable for those who feel that economics is difficult to understand!!<br /><br />(published 2003; preface; 7 chapters; main narrative 220 pages; bibliographical references; index)<br /><br />+++++se in the long-term if proper thinking has not gone into the initial economic decision.

The theory, superstring theory, is the subject of this book.\\"<br /><br />What is superstring theory?  The definition of it is simple: it is \\"string theory [an example of a theory of quantum gravity] that incorporates supersymmetry.\\"<br /><br />In order to understand this definition you have to read this book since superstring theory builds on the theoretical concepts of the past.  Thus, this book is not only a science book, but also tells us about the history of science in the twentieth century.<br /><br />This book has five parts and fifteen chapters:<br /><br />PART 1:<br /><br />(1) Explains particle physics.  Matter is composed of atoms, which in turn are made from quarks and electrons.  According to string theory, all such particles are actually tiny loops of vibrating one-dimensional objects or strings.<br /><br />PART  2:<br /><br />(2) Explains Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity.  It deals with Einstein's laws of space and time in the absence of gravity.<br />(3) Deals with Einstein's Theory of General Relativity.  It explains the force of gravity in terms of the curvature of a space-time continuum.<br />(4) Describes Quantum Mechanics.  It considers laws at the microscopic scale of atoms.<br />(5) Considers the incompatibility of general relativity and quantum mechanics.  Thus a unification theory that bridges these two theories is needed.<br /><br />PART 3:<br /><br />(6) Explains the essentials of string theory.  This theory is a unified theory of the universe that postulates that the fundamental ingredients of nature are not point particles (like electrons and quarks) but tiny vibrating filaments called strings.  It unites general relativity and quantum mechanics.<br />(7) Describes what is meant by symmetry.  From this the concepts of supersymmetry and superstring theory are formulated.  Symmetry is a property of a physical system that does not change when the system is transformed in some manner.  For example, a sphere is said to be rotationally symmetrical since its appearance doesn't change when rotated.  In supersymmetry, all classes of elementary particles are placed on an equal footing.  Superstring theory is defined in paragraph two above.<br />(8) Deals with how superstring theory requires the universe to have additional spatial dimensions.<br />(9) Details how superstring theory has the potential to be the most predictive theory that physicists have ever studied.<br /><br />PART 4:<br /><br />(10) Explains quantum geometry that describes space on ultramicroscopic scales, where quantum effects become important.<br />(11) Asks the question: can the fabric of space be torn and, if it can, what happens?<br />(12) Examines the mysterious M-theory.  It is a theory that unites the previous five known superstring theories.<br />(13) Describes black holes from the superstring and M-string perspective. A black hole is a region of space-time where nothing, not even light, can escape since gravity is so strong.<br />(14) Considers cosmology and superstring theory.  Cosmology is the study of the universe.<br /><br />PART 5:<br /><br />(15) Discusses five central questions that superstring theorists will eventually face.<br /><br />  For those with some background, parts one and two will be a review.  However, for those with no background, they will find that these parts are exceptionally well written and understandable.  Part three becomes a bit abstract as you proceed.  The first three chapters of part four are very abstract is some sections.  The last two chapters of part four and part five are well written with hardly any abstractions.<br /><br />You will find only one equation in this book: Einstein's famous equation. This book relies not only on analogy and metaphor but on excellent diagrams to get its mathematical concepts across.  For me, the diagrams were a majorhighlight of this book.<br /><br />Finally, there is a very useful glossary of scientific terms at the end of this book.  You will find familiar terms in this glossary as well as those that pertain to superstring theory.  Many of the ideas found in this glossary were used in the above descriptions.  The definition of \\"Quantum Gravity\\" (in the title of this review) is found in this glossary:  it is a theory that merges quantum mechanics and general relativity, possibly involving modifications of one or both.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a book that is about a search that so far has concluded with superstring theory.  Why bother with this search (and thus this book)? Greene explains: \\"The search for the fundamental laws of the universe is a distinctly human drama, one that has stretched the mind and enriched the spirit.\\"<br /><br />+++++..highlight of this book.<br /><br />Finally, there is a very useful glossary of scientific terms at the end of this book.

Behe states this in the form of a question: \\"How could complex biochemical systems be gradually produced?\\"<br /><br /> A \\"black box\\" is anything that has a complex function and can be observed but whose inner workings are mysterious or even unknown. \\"To Darwin...as to every other scientist of the [mid-1800s] the cell [which contains the molecules of life] was a black box.\\"<br /><br /> Parts one and three of this easy-to-read book are non-technical while part two is highly technical in sections. Part one and especially part two contain helpful diagrams but part three has no diagrams. There is an appendix that gives readers \\"an overview of biochemical principles that [support] life.\\"<br /><br /> *PART 1 of the book shows why evolution must now be argued at the molecular or biochemical level. Two things caught my eye when I read this part:<br /><br /> (i) Behe states that \\"I find the idea of common decent [from a common ancestor by gradual steps over very long periods of time]...fairly convincing, and have no particular reason to doubt it.\\" In other words, he believes in evolution for large body parts (like the arms or legs).<br /><br /> (ii) He states , \\"If you search the scientific literature on [molecular and biochemical evolution]...you find an eerie and complete silence.\\"<br /><br /> The most important concept presented in this part is the idea of an \\"irreducibly complex\\" system. Behe explains: \\"By irreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several...interacting parts that contribute to the [system's] basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to...cease functioning.\\" He uses \\"the humble mousetrap\\" as an example of such a system.<br /><br /> **PART 2, the longest part, gives in detail, an example of five irreducibly complex biological and biochemical systems: (a) bacterial flagellum and cilium (b) blood clotting (c) transport within the cell, (d) the human immune system (e) and the biosynthesis of AMP (a critical building block of nucleic acids).<br /><br /> ***PART 3 is the most opinionated part of this book that discusses the implications of biochemistry's discoveries. Here, Behe states his conclusion: \\"The biochemical systems discussed in [PART 2] were designed by an intelligent agent.\\" Besides this conclusion, other things that caught my eye are as follows:<br /><br /> (I) Behe states \\"that some biochemical systems were designed [but this] does not mean all [such] systems were...designed.\\"<br /><br /> (II) To determine whether a system was designed, you have to look at a system's complexity. Design can be \\"hard to see.\\"<br /><br /> If you read carefully the above summaries of the three parts of this book, you can design an argument that summarizes this entire book.  For this argument, remember something that is irreducibly complex requires all its parts to function properly.  Also, for this argument I will be using the bacterial flagellum but any of the systems of PART 2 above can be used.<br /><br />This is BEHE's ARGUMENT:<br /><br /> (1) A mousetrap is irreducibly complex<br /> (2) The bacterial flagellum is irreducibly complex<br /> (3) A mousetrap is a product of intelligent design<br /> (4) Conclusion #1: the flagellum is similar to a mousetrap<br /> (5) Conclusion #2: the flagellum is a product of design.<br /><br /> Let's design the exact same argument but with more familiar things:<br /><br /> (1) A table has four legs<br /> (2) A cat has four legs<br /> (3) A table is a product of intelligent design<br /> (4) First conclusion: a cat is similar to a table<br /> (5) Second conclusion: a cat is a product of design.<br /><br /> Clearly, the first conclusion is ridiculous and false. (You have to be very careful in comparing non-living and living objects based on only one similarity.) Hence the second conclusion is false. Similarly, BEHE's ARGUMENT above is false.<br /><br /> In *PART 1 (i) above, Behe states he believes in Darwinian evolution on a large body part scale but, according to this book's purpose, he does not believe this on a molecular, biochemical scale. How can this be? Large body parts are made up of molecules. How can the large parts undergo Darwinian evolution but the molecules that make up these parts evolve by a different mechanism? I found this very confusing!<br /><br /> I did the search suggested in *PART 1 (ii) above. I came up with a site that had links to over 1000 research papers on molecular evolution going back to the mid-1970s. I also found papers that dealt with the molecular evolution of the five complex systems described in part two of this book. Thus, there is not \\"complete silence\\" on this subject.<br /><br />Finally, in ***PART 3 (I) and (II) above, Behe suggests that only some not all molecular systems are intelligently designed. He further suggests that to determine the ones that are designed, all you have do is look at the system. This is very subjective. You would never get agreement using this criterion. Besides, why would some molecular systems be designed and others not?<br /><br /> In conclusion, except for part two and the appendix of this book, I would recommend reading this book both cautiously and critically.<br /><br />** 1/2<br /><br />XXXXXts based on only one similarity.) Hence the second conclusion is false.

This ten chapter book, by Dr. Bruce Schechter, is a BIOgraphy of Dr. Paul Erdos (pronounced \\"Air-dish\\").<br /><br />Erdos (1913 to 1996) is said to have been one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century (especially in number theory, the branch of math concerned with the properties of integers) as well as the most eccentric.  Throughout this book, we also learn of the many others who collaborated with Erdos on his many published mathematical papers.  (He wrote or collaborated on more than 1500 papers with over 450 collaborators.)<br /><br />This book is also filled with the sorts of mathematical puzzles that intrigued Erdos and continue to fascinate mathematicians today.  Schechter does a good job of explaining these puzzles (with the aid of diagrams, tables, and graphs) so the reader does not have to worry that these problems will be too difficult to understand.<br /><br />The reader is also taken on a tour of mathematics.  We are introduced to such people as Pythagoras and his famous theorem, Karl Gauss who, when ten years old, was able to add up the numbers from 1 to 100 in less than half a minute, and Bernhard Reimann and his work on prime numbers.<br /><br />Erdos was born in Hungry.  By age seventeen he had gained international recognition as a prodigy.  He eventually left Hungry and went to the Institute of Advanced Study at Princton in the United States.  (Einstein was the institutes most famous resident then.)  Because of his politics, he was exiled from the U.S. for a decade.  From this point beginning in the 1950s, he became \\"the Bob Hope of mathematics\\" or \\"the travelling mathematician.\\"<br /><br />Since Erdos was constantly travelling, he had no home or job but still managed to meet with math colleagues all over the world.  He had all his belongings in a suitcase and his mathematical papers in a bag when he arrived at their homes.  Erdos also depended on the generosity of colleagues to sustain him.<br /><br />The reader is introduced to Erdos' eccentricities throughout the book.  For example, he invented a vocabulary where the U.S. was \\"Sam\\" or \\"Samland\\" (after Uncle Sam) and the Soviet Union was \\"Joe\\" or \\"Joedom\\" (after Josef Stalin).<br /><br />There are more than fifteen black and white photographs found in the middle of this book.  These photos span a period from 1916 to 1993.<br /><br />To get the information needed to write this book, Schechter relied \\"on the memories of the many people\\" who met Erdos -- his hundreds of collaborators and friends.  That is, he \\"primarily relied on interviews with many of the people who knew Erdos best.\\"  Schechter also \\"drew heavily\\" from biographical essays as well as magazine articles about Erdos.  He also used the information from the over ninety sources listed in this book's bibliography.<br /><br />Finally, as I said above, this book does contain mathematical puzzles that intrigued Erdos.  Personally, I found these interesting but some readers may find that they interfere with the flow of the book.  As well, mathematicians who read this book may question the accuracy of a few of the mathematical concepts that are introduced.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book invites the reader into the wacky world of mathematical genius Paul Erdos.

So, I made the assumption that I knew the true story.  Then I read this book.  Was my assumption ever wrong!!!<br /><br />This particular book (published by Signet Classics in Sept. 2003) of less than 150 pages has five parts:<br /><br />(1) Opening Pages.  They include a brief biography of Robert Louis Stevenson (1850 to 1894).  (Takes up 4% of the book.)<br />(2) Introductory Essay.  This was written by the late, famous Russian author Vladimir Nabokov.  (Takes up 20%.)<br />(3) The Actual Story.  Its original title is \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" (1886).  (Takes up 65%.)<br />(4) Afterword to the Story.  It is written by a modern writer.  (Takes up 8%.)<br />(5) Selected Bibliography.  Outlines great works by and about R.L. Stevenson.  (Takes up 3%.)<br /><br />The introductory essay was an actual lecture Nabokov gave when he was associate professor at Cornell University from 1948 to 1959.  It gives a thorough, detailed analysis of this \\"seldom read\\" classic.<br /><br />The afterword consists of a shorter analysis of this classic by the modern writer Dan Chaon.  I felt that this afterword provided valuable insight regarding the story of Jekyll and Hyde.<br /><br />Chaon sums up the entire story:  \\"The structure of ['Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'] follows a path as indirect and elusive as its multiple narrative voices.  With its obliquely recorded incidents, its eyewitness accounts and sealed confessions, it resembles...a [police detective's] casebook--a collection of gathered clues, fragments, through which the clever detective may be able to...project a complete narrative.  Perhaps one of the most compelling aspects of this novel [of ten chapters] is that, in fact, there's so much left here for [the reader] to fill in, so many scenes that [the reader] can only imagine.  Such a structure creates fertile ground for allegory [a story with symbolic meaning] hunters, and there are indeed many convincing interpretations of this novel...The puzzle-like structure of the novel [which only has eight major male characters] creates a kind of Rorechach test, open to various interpretations.\\"  (A Rorechach test is where a person interprets inkblot designs.)<br /><br />The inspiration of this short novel is said to have come from a dream (or, perhaps more accurately, a nightmare) Stevenson had.  His actual writing is amazing and skillful in all chapters.  The writing especially of the last two chapters, chapters nine and ten, stood out for me.  Here, for example, is his actual description of what happened when somebody observed someone using Dr. Jekyll's concoction:  \\"He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp.  A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; as I looked there came, I thought, a change--he seemed to swell--his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter--and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arm raised to shield me...[and] my mind submerged in terror.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the cover of this particular book is interesting.  It shows the shadow of a man in a top hat behind a window shade.  This can be taken to represent Hyde who is a shadowy character.<br /><br />In conclusion, this particular book has it all: an introduction by a late, well-known author, an intriguing mystery/horror story by a late, famous nineteenth century author, and an afterword by a gifted, modern writer.  Be sure to read this book to learn the true story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde!!!<br /><br />+++++ny convincing interpretations of this novel...The puzzle-like structure of the novel [which only has eight major male characters] creates a kind of Rorechach test, open to various interpretations.\\"  (A Rorechach test is where a person interprets inkblot designs.)<br /><br />The inspiration of this short novel is said to have come from a dream (or, perhaps more accurately, a nightmare) Stevenson had.

His life is traced from him first entering a monastery before deciding to lead a life of scientific inquiry and discovery.  Actual letters or parts of letters (translated from the original Latin, French, or Italian by various experts) by Galileo and others are included in the main narrative.  Throughout, we are told of his numerous inventions and discoveries.  Perhaps the most sensational is that his telescopes allowed him to reveal a new reality in the heavens and to reinforce the Copernican argument that the Earth moves around the Sun.  For this belief, he was brought before the Holy Inquisition, accused of heresy, and forced eventually to spend his last years under house arrest.  All the translated papers pertaining to these inquisition days are included and make for fascinating reading.<br /><br />My favorite Inquisition story is with respect to the June 1633 renunciation or \\"confession\\" document (reproduced in this book) Galileo was to speak out aloud.  The main point of this document is that the Earth does not move around the Sun and that the Earth does not move at all.  After reading it aloud, it is said that he muttered under his breath \\"Eppur si muove\\" (translation: \\"But it does move\\").<br /><br />One of Galileo's daughters born \\"Virginia\\" and later appropriately named \\"Sister Maria Celeste,\\" had the intelligence and sensibility of her father.  As indicated by her letters, her loving support, which Galileo repaid in kind, proved to be her father's greatest source of strength through his most productive but tumultuous years.  Sobel herself translated these letters from the original Italian.  They are expertly woven into the main narrative adding an emotional element to this biography.<br /><br />This book contains almost twenty-five complete letters and numerous large and small fragments from other letters by Sister Celeste.  All letters she wrote begin with a statement showing love and respect for her father.  Example: \\"Most Illustrious Lord Father.\\"  The first complete letter is dated (May 10, 1623) and the last complete letter is dated (Dec. 10, 1633).  Those letters Galileo wrote to his daughter have not survived.<br /><br />Almost 75 illustrations are found throughout this book.  They add (besides the actual letters of Galileo's daughter) yet another dimension to the narrative.  Two of my favorite pictures are entitled \\"Moon drawings by Galileo in 1609\\" and \\"Sunspot drawings by Galileo.\\"<br /><br />Another intriguing aspect of this book is a chronology after the main narrative ends entitled \\"In Galileo's Time.\\"  This is not just a timeline of important events that occurred during Galileo's life but includes all significant events (especially scientific ones) between 1543 to 1999 inclusive.  For example, what happened in 1687?  According to this chronology, \\"Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation are published in his [book] 'Principia.'\\"  What happened in 1989?  Answer: \\"[NASA] launches [the] 'Galileo' spacecraft [or space probe] to study the moons of Jupiter at close range.\\"<br /><br />Where did the author obtain all the fascinating information needed to write such an intriguing book?  Answer: from the over 130 references found in the bibliography.<br /><br />I noticed in the book's \\"Appreciation\\" section that the author gives thanks to many people.  Dr. Frank Drake, who helped with the celestrial mechanics found in this book, caught my eye.  Sobel co-authored with Drake the excellent book \\"Is Anyone Out There?: The Scientific Search for Extraterrestral Intelligence\\" (paperback, 1994).<br /><br />Finally, my only minor complaint is with the book's title.  As mentioned above, there are two interconnected themes running through this book.  Thus, I think a more appropriate title might have been \\"Galileo and his Daughter.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is a thorough biography of Galileo that includes some translated letters from one of his daugters.  It is truly, as the book's subtitle states, \\"A Historical Memoir of Science, Faith, and Love!!!\\"<br /><br />+++++y, my only minor complaint is with the book's title.

Economics is about the financial state of individuals.<br />2. Understanding how prices function is the foundation for understanding the rest of economics.<br />3. The free market system is a profit system.<br />4. Wages and salaries do not serve the same economic purpose as product prices.<br />5. Investment, speculation, and insurance do not really contribute anything to the economy.<br />6. What is true of the various parts or sectors of a national economy is likely not true of the national economy as a whole.<br />7. International trade is where one country gains and the other country loses.<br />8. Economics does not say that you should make the most money possible.<br /><br />If you answered true to any one of statements (1,3,4,5, or 7) and false to any one of statements (2,6, or 8), then you may need the help of this book.<br /><br />This book, by professor and economist Thomas Sowell, has the purpose of explaining basic economics.  It \\"does not contain a single graph or equation [or technical] jargon.\\"  As well, \\"This book is written for...people [that] have no interest in the paraphernalia of the economics profession.\\"  (In my case, I read this book to review basic economic concepts.)<br /><br />This book has twenty-five chapters that are divided into seven parts after an introductory chapter that answers the question of \\"What is Economics?\\"  The seven parts are as follows:<br /><br />(1) Prices<br />(2) Industry & Commerce<br />(3) Work & Pay<br />(4) Time & Risk<br />(5) The National Economy<br />(6) The International Economy<br />(7) Popular Economic Fallacies.<br /><br />This book is very user-friendly and its \\"chapters can be read in any order that [the reader's] own interest dictates\\" but the author recommends reading part one first.  Each part ends with an excellent \\"overview\\" chapter that is a general review of the more detailed chapters of a particular part.<br /><br />I found that this book gives a good, solid, mostly non-technical explanation of the major and key concepts or principles of basic economics.  That is, the principles introduced are fundamental, elementary, and essential.  Sowell does this by assuming a \\"free economy\\" or a \\"free enterprise\\" system which strictly means an economy where private industry operates under freely, competitive conditions with minimal governmental influence.  I appreciated the fact that examples of the historic economic experiences of other countries (such as the former Soviet Union) are given and explained throughout the book's chapters.<br /><br />I did notice that the book did have strong, political overtones and is biased towards the theory of a \\"laissez-faire\\" (pronounced \\"less-eh-fare\\") economy.  (Laissez-faire is the policy of letting the owners of business and industry fix the rules of competition, the conditions of labor, etc., as they please, without any governmental regulation or control.)  Personally, this did not bother me because, as I said, I was reading this book to review basic economic concepts.  However, some readers may not appreciate these overtones and this bias and let these overshadow the true intension of this book -- to explain basic, economic principles.<br /><br />Finally, this book does not contain any diagrams.  I feel simple diagrams would have been helpful in reducing the book's wordiness.  As well, a summary listing all of the basic economic concepts introduced throughout the book would have been very helpful.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an excellent introduction to basic economics as long as you don't let the author's political views and his bias bother you.<br /><br />+++++found that this book gives a good, solid, mostly non-technical explanation of the major and key concepts or principles of basic economics.

In order to understand the significance of this text, the reader has to understand some words in this book's title and subtitle.<br /><br />\\"Longitude\\" along with Latitude are two numbers along with their compass directions that are used to fix the position of anything on the planet Earth (as in the note above).  Lines of Latitude are the imaginary, parallel, horizontal lines circling the Earth with the equator (fixed by nature) being the \\"zero-degree parallel of latitude.\\"  Lines of Longitude or \\"meridians\\" are the imaginary lines that run top to bottom (north to south), from the Earth's North Pole to its South Pole with the \\"prime meridian\\" (established by political means) being the \\"zero-degree meridian of longitude.\\"  (Since the mid-1880s, the prime meridian has passed through Greenwich, England.  Before this time, the imaginary line that passed through a ship's home port was usually used as the zero-degree meridian.)<br /><br />Finding latitude on land or sea is easy and eventually a device was invented to make it even more easier.  But finding longitude, especially at sea on a swaying ship is difficult, a difficulty \\"that stumped the wisest minds of the world for the better part of human history\\" and was \\"the greatest scientific problem\\" of the 1770s.  Ways of determining longitude astronomically were devised, but these proved to be impractical when used at sea.<br /><br />England's parliament recognized that \\"the longitude problem\\" had to be solved practically since many ships containing people and valuable cargo were lost at sea as soon as the ship's navigators lost sight of land.  Thus, this parliament offered a top monetary prize that's equivalent to many millions of dollars today to anyone who could solve this problem.<br /><br />Enter \\"a lone genius\\" named John Harrison (1693 to 1776).  While most thought that the solution to this problem was astronomical, Harrison saw time as the solution.<br /><br />To calculate the longitude using time on a ship at sea, you have to realize these two facts found in this book:<br /><br />(i) The Earth takes 24 hours of time to spin 360 degrees on its axis from east to west.<br />(ii) Noon (12:00 PM) is the highest point the sun seems to \\"travel\\" in a day.<br /><br />To learn one's longitude at sea using time, as the book explains, it's necessary to do the following:<br /><br />(1) Know the time it is aboard ship.  (Local noon was normally used because of fact (ii) above.)<br />(2) At the very same moment, know the time at a known longitude (such as at Greenwich, England).<br />(3) The difference in time between (1) and (2) is converted to a longitude reading in degrees and direction (using fact (i) above.)<br /><br />So Harrison's solution was the determination of time of (2) above by inventing a precise timepiece.  It would, in this case, be set to Greenwich time.  (Note that, as stated, (1) could be determined using the noon-day sun but this was not always practical.  Eventually, another timepiece was used to determine the ship's local noon for a particular day.)  It should be realized that this was the \\"era of pendulum clocks\\" where, on a deck of a rocking ship, \\"such clocks would slow down, or speed up, or stop running altogether.\\"  Harrison was to capture time by building a marine clock or \\"timekeeper\\" (eventually called a \\"chronometer\\") that could be used on a ship at sea.<br /><br />This book tells the \\"true story\\" of Harrison and his chronometers.  (There were five built over a forty-year period.  Harrison's first timekeeping device was known as H-1, his second was H-2, and so on.)  Sobel uses accuracy (as evidenced by her many references) and extensive interviews with experts in the historical and marine navigational fields to create an engaging, mostly non-technical narrative to convey a story that's filled with suspense, heroism, perfectionism, and villiany.  (She includes some essential technical detail of her description of Harrison's timekeepers.)<br /><br />The nearly 180 illustrations chosen by William Andrewes compliment and add another dimension to Sobel's text.  As Sobel explains: \\"Images of characters, events, instruments (especially [the exterior and interior] of Harrison's [timekeeping] contrivances), maps,and publications...illuminate the narrative.  These pictures, paired with Will's detailed, [informative, and well-referenced] captions, offer up their own version of a swashbuckling, scientific adventure in the context of history and technology.\\"<br /><br />Finally, there is a good 1999 movie entitled \\"Longitude\\" that is based on this book's text.  It makes all the illustrations in this book come alive.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book's text and illustrations document the exciting story of how \\"a lone genius\\" solved \\"the longitude problem.\\"  Sobel states this more eloquently: \\"With his marine clocks, John Harrison tested the waters of space-time.  He succeeded, against all odds, in using the fourth...dimension to link points on a three-dimensional globe.  He [took] the world's whereabouts from the stars, and locked [or captured] the secret in a...watch.\\"<br /><br />+++++arine navigational fields to create an engaging, mostly non-technical narrative to convey a story that's filled with suspense, heroism, perfectionism, and villiany.

These works were written by five intellectual \\"giants\\" (all men whose portraits are shown on the book's cover).  This book's title \\"On the Shoulders of Giants\\" was a phrase used in a letter by one of these men and the meaning of it is the theme of this book.  Its meaning, as Dr. Stephen Hawking states, is \\"how science...is a series of incremental advances each building on what went before.\\"  This book uses these five men's great works \\"to trace the evolution of our picture of the heavens.\\"<br /><br />This book was edited and has \\"commentary\\" by Hawking.  The reader is not told exactly what Hawking's commentary is but I assume it is the short but excellent introduction to the book, the brief but informative biographies or \\"Life and Work\\" of each man, and the helpful footnotes included with each great work.  All these as a whole comprise less than 2% of this nearly 1300 page book.<br /><br />I found in the page entitled \\"A Note on the Texts\\" the following:  \\"The texts [or great works] in this book are based on translations of the original, printed editions [or papers].  [There has been] no attempt to modernize [or correct] the author's own distinct usage, spelling, or punctuation, or to make the texts consistent with each other in this regard.\\"  I assume this also applies to errors in grammar and errors to equations (such as omissions).  That is, any errors in the original, translated papers are not corrected.<br /><br />Who were these giants and what great work (that's included in this book) did they produce?  The answer is as follows:<br /><br />1. Nicolaus Copernicus (1473 to 1543).  The work included is entitled \\"On the Revolutions of [the] Heavenly Spheres\\" (1543).  This work was the beginning of the Sun-centered \\"Copernican revolution.\\"  It has an introduction and six parts or \\"books.\\"  This work comprises about 30% of this book.<br /><br />2. Galileo Galilei (1564 to 1642).  Work included: \\"Dialogues [or Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations] Concerning Two [New] Sciences\\" (1638).  This work \\"is widely held to be the cornerstone of modern physics.\\"  It has four parts or \\"days.\\"  It comprises about 18% of the book.<br /><br />3. Johannes Kepler (1571 to 1630).  Work included: Book Five of \\"Harmonies of the World\\" (1618).  With this book and his other four, \\"Kepler discovered how planets orbited.\\"  It has an introduction and ten chapters.  Comprises 7% of this book.<br /><br />4. Sir Isaac Newton (1642 to 1727).  Work included: \\"The Mathematical Priciples of Natural Philosophy\\" (1687).  Better known as \\"The Principia.\\"  This work includes Newton's three laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation.  It has an introduction and three parts or \\"books.\\"  Comprises 34% of this book.<br /><br />5. Albert Einstein (1879 to 1955).  Work (which was co-authored) includes: Seven selections from \\"The Principles of Relativity: A Collection of Original Papers on the Special Theory of Relativity\\" (1922).  In these works, read how Einstein altered our perception of space and time.  Comprises 8% of this book.<br /><br />To read the works of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler, it would be helpful to know some geometry, trigonometry, and algebra.  The same goes for the work of Newton but knowing some calculus would also be helpful.  For the works of Einstein, knowing some advanced mathematics (such as advanced calculus) would be helpful.<br /><br />I found, for myself, that in all of the above great works, the person's thought processes could be easily followed (even if the mathematics was unclear).  This even applied to the works of Einstein.  I recommend reading each of these works slowly and taking frequent breaks since the reading can become tedious at times.<br /><br />There were three problems I found with this book:<br /><br />First, the table of contents.  For the major works, it just states their title and page number of where they begin.  For example, the work of Einstein begins on page 1167 and that's all we're told!!  Why not list the seven selections that are included?  Thus, state in the table of contents that one selection has the title \\"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\\" and that it begins on page 1193.  Or consider the work of Copernicus.  Why not state that part four of his work starts on page 197?  Since this book is so large (and probably intimitating to some), I feel that a good, detailed table of contents is imperative.<br /><br />Second, I found small errors in that 1% of the book that does not include the great works and Life & Work sections.  (Fortunately, these errors are corrected in these sections of the book.)  For example, in the \\"A Note on the Texts\\" page, we are told that \\"Kepler completed [his] work on May...1816.\\"  But he died in 1630!  Or the table of contents states that Newton's birth year was 1643.  I don't normally nit-pick like this, but since there were only five men, I feel that little errors like this should not be made.<br /><br />Third, the \\"Life and Work\\" sections are not referenced.  Where was this detailed information obtained?<br /><br />Finally, a few equations in the Einstein papers have errors (like omissions, etc.)  As explained above, these were probably in the original, printed work and thus were not corrected.  In most cases, I found I could correct the error myself.  I did find three equations where some variables were cut-off.  I found I could easily deduce what the variables should be.  Even with these minor errors, the Einstein section is still very informative and usable.<br /><br />In conclusion, these five intellectual giants revolutionized the course of science.

Abbot (1838 to 1926), you have to understand what is meant by the word \\"dimension,\\" a word in the book's subtitle \\"A Romance of Many Dimensions.\\"  A dimension is any measureable distance such as length or width.  So something that has one dimension has only one measurable distance, something that has two dimensions has two measurable distances, and so on.  You also have to realize that there are geometrical forms that can be drawn in these dimensions.  Thus a line is such a form that only has one dimension, a triangle is such a form that has two dimensions that appears flat and non-solid, and a sphere is such a form in three dimensions that appears solid.  (Another name for three dimensions is space.)<br /><br />Part one (twelve chapters) of this book gives us a glimpse of the two-dimensional land where the narrator, Mr. \\"A. Square,\\" comes from.  This place, called \\"Flatland,\\" is inhabitated by two-dimensional beings of which Square is one.  These beings no nothing of \\"up\\" and \\"down.\\"  Square tells us details of Flatland society such as its resident's domestic life and its political turmoil.  It is a place dominated by such things as a rigid social hierarchy, sexism, and closed-mindedness.<br /><br />Abbot was a Victorian and his description of Flatland is meant to be a parody (using wry humor and biting satire) of English Victorian society.  Abbot seems to have fun mocking the upper classes of the 1880s in his book.  I found that much of what Abbot says can be applied to modern society.<br /><br />As an example, Square tells us of the social hierarchy that exists: \\"Our women are straight lines.  Our soldiers and lowest classes of workmen are Triangles with two equal sides [called an Isosceles triangle]...Our middle class consists of Equilateral or equal sided triangles...Our professional men...are Squares...and five-sided figures, or Hexagons, and thence rising in the number of their sides till they receive the honorable title of Polygonal, or many-sided...Finally when the number of sides becomes so numerous...that the figure cannot be distinguished from a Circle, he is included in the Circular or Priestly order; and this is the highest class of all.\\"<br /><br />Part two (ten chapters) of this book is very interesting since Square tells us of his visits to \\"Lineland\\" (a land of one dimension), \\"Spaceland\\" (a land of three dimensions, a land Earthlings are used too), and \\"Pointland\\" (a land of no dimensions).  Readers will find that they will have to adjust their thinking every time the two-dimensional Square visits a world of different dimensions.  For example, when Square meets \\"Sphere\\" (of Spaceland), the reader will have to \\"see\\" Sphere as Square does--in two dimensions.  The end of this part has Square realizing that three (and perhaps more) dimensions exist and trying to tell his fellow close-minded Flatlanders this.<br /><br />My favorite sentence in part two occurs when Sphere makes an unexpected visit to Square's home (and Square doesn't know who Sphere is, fearing that he is a burglar).  Square says, \\"The thought flashed across me that I might have before me a burglar or cut-throat, some monstrous irregular Isoceles, who by feigning the voice of a Circle, had obtained admission somehow into the house, and was now preparing to stab me with his acute angle.\\"<br /><br />Abbot, besides being a writer and educator, was also a theologian.  So are their any spiritual or metaphysical aspects to this book?  The answer is yes but this is not always obvious.  For example, when Sphere makes his first unexpected visit to Square's home, he slowly seems to materialize in front of Square.  Thus Sphere seems to be a supernatural, supreme being and Square refers to him as \\"your Lordship.\\"  Another example is Sphere sees Square as \\"a fit apostle for the Gospel of the Three Dimensions.\\"<br /><br />This book is written in Victorian English that may be difficult (for some) to comprehend at first.  But I found that as I progressed further into the book and got used to this type of English, it becomes much easier to comprehend.  The sketches found throughout the book also help immensely in getting across what Abbot was attempting to convey.<br /><br />This book raises a number of questions, some of which are as follows:<br /><br />(1) Why does our universe have three dimensions and not two or four?<br />(2) In what ways does our three-dimensional universe affect its physical, chemical, and biological properties?<br />(3) Do universes that have two, four, five, or more dimensions exist?<br />(4) If other universes of different dimensions do exist, then are there beings in these other dimensions?<br /><br />Finally, for those who want a good non-fiction account of possible other dimensions, I recommend Dr. Michio Kaku's book \\"Hyperspace: A Scientific Odyssey through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10TH Dimension\\" (1994).<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a unique book that sparks your imagination and raises certain questions.  Be warned though!  By reading this book, you may become one in \\"a race of rebels who...refuse to be confined to [a] limited dimensionality.\\"<br /><br />+++++ictorian English that may be difficult (for some) to comprehend at first.

In this book (book two), Dante enters the second phase of his journey through Purgatory where there again is suffering of souls but it is temporary and this temporary suffering is meant to be a means of purification of sin.<br /><br />Dante begins this part of his journey by stating the following:<br /><br />\\"Now shall I sing that second kingdom [Purgatory] given<br />the soul of man wherein to purge its guilt<br />and so grow worthy to ascend to Heaven.\\"<br /><br />Note that the acsension to Heaven is dealt with in the third book containing part three entitled \\"The Paridiso.\\"<br /><br />There is a historical introduction by Archibald MacAllister of Princeton.  It is imperative to have a good understanding of Dante in order to understand his poetic masterpiece and MacAllister does a good job in detailing Dante and his times.  There are also helpful specific comments about this part.<br /><br />The late John Ciardi, former poet and professor of Harvard and Rutgers universities, translated this poem from its original 1300's Italian into English.  He admits that \\"Any...remarks offered by a translator are bound to be an apology for his failures.  Obviously, no sane translator can allow himself to dream of [complete] success.  He asks only for the best possible failure.\\"  Scholars and purists may thus not appreciate Ciardi's translation.  I, however, enjoyed his rhyming translation.<br /><br />In contrast with the turbulent complexity of Hell, Dante's Purgatory is simple.  It has only three sections that overall comprise thirty-three episodes (or \\"cantos\\"):<br /><br />Bottom Section: \\"The Anti-Purgatory.\\"<br />Middle Section: \\"The Purgatory\\" Proper with its \\"Seven Capital Vices\\" (or \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\").  The Gate that leads from Anti-Purgatory to Purgatory Proper is found in episode nine.<br />Top Section: \\"The Earthly Paradise.\\"  It begins at episode twenty-seven.<br /><br />As in part one, Dante takes this incredible journey with his master and guide, Virgil.  This time, these two meet another person who journeys with them.  Along the way, the travellers and the reader encounter such things as people of Dante's time, biblical references, mythical creatures and people, legends, and those who are temporarily suffering.  As well, near the end of this journey, Virgil vanishes.<br /><br />As with part one, this part is a narrative poem whose greatest strength lies in the fact it does not so much narrate as dramatize its episodes.  It is a visual work that sparks your imagination.<br /><br />Ciardi's mini-summary in italics before each episode give the reader a brief glimpse of what to expect.  His (foot)notes at the end of each episode highlight our understanding of key passages within each.  For me, Ciardi's mini-summaries and notes that accompany each episode are the cornerstone to understanding what Dante was attempting to convey.  As well, Dante can be challenging and tedious to read at times.  These mini-summaries and notes help the reader meet the challenge and overcome the tedium.<br /><br />The table of contents incorrectly indicates that there are no illustrations in this book.  Actually, there are four and they increase the understanding of and add another visual dimension to the poem.<br /><br />Also, there is a section at the back of the book entitled \\"How To Read Dante.\\"  It provides invaluable information about Dante and his \\"Divine Comedy.\\"<br /><br />I should mention the impressive art on the cover of this book.  It has a reproduction of the 1825 painting by artist William Blake showing Dante and Virgil (who are still in Anti-Purgatory) approaching the Angel who guards the \\"Gate of Purgatory\\" Proper.<br /><br />You can read this second book without first reading the first book.  However, be aware that Dante does occasionally refer back to book one.<br /><br />Finally, as I said this is a very imaginative poem.  Thus, I recommend \\"The Dore Illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy\\" (1976) by Gustave Dore.  This book will add another vivid visual dimension to the poem.<br /><br />In conclusion, don't miss this second phase of Dante's amazing journey.

Everyone wants to go there...	+++++<br /><br />This sequel (first published in 2001) to the previous popular novel K-PAX (1995), both authored by Gene Brewer, consists again of sixteen chapters (or \\"sessions\\") and has as well a prologue and epilogue.  (There is no short glossary as in the previous novel.)<br /><br />The prot-agonist of this story who calls himself \\"Prot\\" (pronounced pr-OAT) \\"returns\\" (after a five year absence) from the utopian planet K-PAX (that, according to the previous novel, is in the constellation Lyra) to enter the mind of the catatonic earthling-patient called \\"Robert Porter\\" (whose identity was discovered at the end of the previous novel).  The setting of this sequel is in the same institution as in the previous novel.<br /><br />Prot is treated by the same psychiatrist of the previous novel, Dr. Gene Brewer.  (Note that the doctor has the same name as the author.)  The entire book again is mainly about the interaction and relationship that develops between Prot and Dr. Brewer.  However, now there is much more interaction between Dr. Brewer and Robert Porter (who is called \\"Rob\\").<br /><br />The previous novel had Prot with much wit, wisdom, and humor.  Prot does not seem to have as much of this in this sequel because more focus is on Rob.  However, Prot's wit and wisdom shine through and he gives interesting social commentary when he appears on a television talk show.  Here are three examples of what Prot says when he was on that show:<br /><br />(1) \\"Why not try living without wars, religion...and the rest for a decade or two?  If you don't like it you can always go back to hatred and killing.\\"<br />(2) \\"What kind of world [on Earth] is it where violence and war are not only accepted, but your youth are encouraged to practice them?  Where your leaders must be constantly guarded against assassination, and airline travellers frisked for weapons?  Where every vial of aspirin must be protected against poisoning?  Where some of your beings make fortunes [playing] games while others are starving?  Where no one believes a single word your governments or your corporations say?\\"<br />(3) \\"Hunting is no sport, it is cold-blooded murder.  If you can outwrestle a bear or chase down a rabbit, then you can consider yourself a true sportsman.\\"<br /><br />Prot still demonstrates certain outworldly abilities and even some of his medical tests are strange.  Thus, both Dr. Brewer and the reader are not sure weather Prot is indeed an extraterrestrial or a traumatized human being suffering from \\"multiple personality disorder.\\"<br /><br />In this sequel, there is more interest in Rob and the other institutionalized patients.  (The reader is introduced to many new and interesting patients.)  Prot still has a positive influence on the other patients thus again giving this sequel a certain warmth.  (He even has a positive influence on animals.)  Through the character of Dr. Brewer, the author reveals and explains certain psychological concepts.<br /><br />Suspense is created when Prot reveals that he is going back to K-PAX for good but this time he does not tell Dr. Brewer the date and time of his \\"departure.\\"  As well, Prot says that this time he will not bring just one (as in the previous novel) but one hundred of his fellow patients with him back to his utopian world.<br /><br />By the end, most questions posed in this sequel are answered.  However, some are not.  In other words, this sequel as in the previous novel ends on an ambiguous note.  (Some readers may not find the ending ambiguous.)  In fact, the last sentence of this sequel is said by Dr. Brewer and reads as follows: \\"I still go out at night and look up at the sky, toward the constellation Lyra.  And I still wonder...\\"<br /><br />Can this sequel be read without reading the previous novel?  Yes it is possible.  But I would not recommend it.  Even though the author Brewer rehashes some of the story from the previous novel in the sequel's prologue and first few chapters, I found that he missed some crucial and interesting information that was needed to fully understand all the finer nuances in this sequel.<br /><br />This sequel is the second novel in a trilogy.  The first novel, as mentioned, was entitled \\"K-PAX\\" while the third novel is entitled \\"K-PAX III: The Worlds of Prot.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good sequel that will hold your attention to the end.

Bush's Military-Industrial Complex	Books	5	37	46	N	N	Nuclear Madness Explained by a Nobel Peace Prize Nominee	+++++<br /><br />The heart of this well-referenced, easy-to-read book (with very informative appendices), by Dr. Helen Caldicott, is about two substances or two chemical elements:<br /><br />(1) Plutonium (Pu)<br />(2) Uranium (U)<br /><br />There are two types or isotopes of plutonium of primary importance:<br /><br />(1) Pu-239<br />(2) Pu-238<br /><br />Pu-239 is used in nuclear weapons and reactors.  Pu-238 is used as a nuclear power source especially in space probe exploration.  Both types of Pu cause severe health consequences when there is exposure to them via various means such as by radiation.  Note that Pu-238 has been called \\"the most dangerous material on Earth.\\"  One pound of Pu-239 \\"is almost the most carcinogenic [cancer-causing] substance known to the human race.\\"<br /><br />There are two types of uranium of importance in nuclear reactions:<br /><br />(1) U-235<br />(2) U-238 (more common)<br /><br />U-235 is also used in nuclear weapons and ammunition.  U has to be processed and there are medical risks associated with processing it.  Both types of U cause severe health consequences when there is exposure to them via various means such as by radiation.<br /><br />A large part of this book deals with nuclear weapons covering such topics as the following: their components, how they work, their testing, the newer and more efficient ones being made, the aging of nuclear weapons, and the deadly consequences of what happens if nuclear weapons are used.  (Caldicott devotes an entire chapter to \\"The Reality of Nuclear War.\\")  It \\"has [been] documented how more than 1.3 billion people have been killed, sickened, or maimed by nuclearism over the past 55 years, and how pollution from nuclear weapons operations has drastically changed the global environment and endangered all life forms.\\"<br /><br />Caldicott presents many examples of innocent people (including children) that now have serious or hopeless medical conditions as a result of being exposed to nuclear radiation through such means as working with and handling nuclear substances, conflict where uranium ammunition is used, and nuclear waste that contaminates food and water sources.<br /><br />This book, I feel, has its greatest impact when it discusses nuclear accidents.  I think most enlightened people are aware that there could be an accidental nuclear war set off by something as simple as the \\"launch of a weather balloon\\" and possibly resulting in the \\"annihilation of the planet.\\"  But other types of accidents are possible.  For example, in 1964 \\"a [U.S.] satellite with a...plutonium power system crashed.  Some 2.1 pounds of plutoniun-238 were dispersed around the world.  A report prepared in 1989...stated that, \\"a worldwide sampling program carried out in 1970 showed [this contamination] to be present at all continents and all latitudes.\\"  Another example closer to where I live:  \\"The most serious Russian nuclear space accident occurred in 1978 when a [Russian] satellite carrying a nuclear reactor smashed into the Northwest Territories of Canada.  Sizable amounts of radioactive debris were distributed over [many thousands of miles]...[The resulting] carcinogenic, radioactive particles posed a serious risk to the population, because they could be either inhaled or ingested through the food chain.\\"<br /><br />The frightening thing is that as more countries acquire nuclear technology and know-how and, as well, as more countries attempt to join the \\"space race,\\" the potential for increased nuclear accidents increases dramatically.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect of this book is how the military, corporate-industrial, and political spheres are intertwined and support nuclearism.  (Caldicott names specific corporations and politicians.)  As a result, tremendous amounts of money are spent on U.S. military programs, money that could be used probably more effectively in non-military areas.<br /><br />Near the end of the book, Caldicott states the following:<br /><br />\\"America has the power and resources to reverse global warming, to save the ozone layer, to prevent chemical pollution, to stop deforestation, to curb the human overpopulation problem...The money that [the American government] invests in killing must now be redirected urgently to the preservation of life.  America must rise to its full moral and spiritual height to reach its intended destiny--the nation that saved the world.<br /><br />In a similar vein, the people of Europe must resist the constant call from America to arm and re-arm.  So too, the people of Canada, of Austrailia--and indeed the people of the world.  We cannot continue to behave as primitive animals killing for pleasure, killing for money, killing for religious imperatives, killing for greed and territorial imperative.  Conflict resolution and peacekeeping must be our new priorities.\\"<br /><br />(Some people see the solutions in the above two paragraphs as unrealistic.  How are they unrealistic?)<br /><br />There are a few inaccuracies in this book.  However, because the overall message is so important, I found it easy to ignore these minor inaccuracies.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a powerful book with a powerful message.  In 1985, the late two-time Nobel Prize winner (once for chemistry, once for peace) Dr. Linus Pauling nominated Dr. Caldicott for a Nobel Peace Prize.  After I read this book, I understood why he nominated her!!<br /><br />+++++br />\\"America has the power and resources to reverse global warming, to save the ozone layer, to prevent chemical pollution, to stop deforestation, to curb the human overpopulation problem...The money that [the American government] invests in killing must now be redirected urgently to the preservation of life.

This book may bring out your PRIMal passion!!	+++++<br /><br />This twelve chapter book by Oxford mathematics professor, Marcus du Sautoy, introduces the reader to the fascinating universe of prime numbers.  At the same time, we enter the world of the mathematician, a world unknown to most readers.<br /><br />What are prime numbers?  A prime is simply a number that cannot be divided by any other number except by one and itself.  For example, the primes up to fifty are as follows:<br /><br />{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47}.<br /><br />This sequence of fifteen prime numbers and even those primes beyond fifty appear to be random.  If you imagine the position of each prime being a note in a musical song, then you get, as this book's title states, \\"the music of the primes.\\"  But for centuries this music was \\"disorganized noise\\" since, as mentioned, the prime numbers appeared to be random leaving such questions as these:<br /><br />(1) How can one predict when the next prime will occur?<br />(2) Is there a formula that can generate prime numbers?<br />(3) Is there a pattern to the apparent randomness of primes?<br /><br />By the mid-1800s, a mathematician named Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866), \\"the Wagner of the mathematical world,\\" came as close as anyone to solving this problem of prime randomness.  He presented an educated guess (known as a hypothesis) that the primes may not be really that random and that there actually may be a \\"harmony\\" between them and other numbers.  In other words the music of the primes may not be as disorganized as once thought.  Indeed, \\"nature [may have] hidden in the primes the music of some mathematical orchestra.\\"<br /><br />Trouble is that Riemann never proved his hypothesis and ever since, this proof, as this book's subtitle states, has become \\"the greatest mystery in mathematics.\\" This book is all about the search for that proof.  Du Sautoy presents the \\"prime suspects\\" (pun intended) in this search to discover the proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.  (Note that anyone in today's world that can discover the proof will win a million dollars.)<br /><br />Du Sautoy describes this quest to find a proof more eloquently:  \\"We [will crisscross] the historical and physical world: Napoleans's Revolutionary France; the neo-humanistic revolution of Germany, from grand Berlin to the medieval streets of [the small town of] Gottingen; the strange alliance between Cambridge [University in England] and India; the isolation of war-torn Norway; the New World, and a new academy founded in Princeton [University] for those brave seekers [seeking the proof] of Riemann's [Hypothesis] expelled from Europe by the ravages of war; and finally to modern Paris and a new [mathematical] language, first [discovered] in a prison cell and which [caused psychological unrest in] the mind of one of its key developers.\\"<br /><br />In order to keep this quest interesting, du Sautoy presents interesting stories and phenomena along the way.  For example, the author describes two species of cicada (large insects) that have prime number life cycles of 13 and 17 years.  He goes on to explain why each species chose a prime number of years as the length of their life cycle.<br /><br />\\"The story of the primes spreads well beyond the mathematical world\\" from quantum physics to computer security.  With respect to computer security, \\"The primes now affect all our lives as they protect the world's electronic secrets from the prying eyes of Internet hackers.\\"<br /><br />There are two things I appreciated about this book.  First, the mathematics.  You don't have to be a math whiz to read this book (even though I found it helpful to slow down and read the math sections carefully).  Important mathematical concepts are explained and complex mathematics is made understandable (which is no small feat).  All this is aided by graphs and tables.  Enough math is presented (actually more math than I expected is presented) so that the reader has a clear understanding of relevant concepts.  (Some people think that not enough math is presented.  Personally, I don't understand this.  As the book's subtitle states, this book is about a search and not solely about complex mathematics.

These thinkers, arranged chronologically from past to present, include those who were involved in one of the following six fields: (1) philosophy (2) physical science (3) social science (4) psychology (5) religious writing (6) theology.  This book begins with a great thinker who lived circa (515 BC to 450 BC) and ends with one who lived from (1913 to 1960).<br /><br />This book can be thought of as a guide or, for some, an introduction to the works and ideas of some of the most creative and influential thinkers of the Western world.  It \\"cannot make everyone an expert in any of the fields the book covers, but it can...provide a foothold on...the illuminating theories and perspectives that have shaped the modern mind and left their traces in the history of human accomplishments.\\"<br /><br />How were these great thinkers chosen?  The editor explains: \\"We have tried to include the most original, creative, and influential thinkers...but we have also recognized the importance of representing the diversity of significant Western thought, even though the result may be that some thinkers that deserve to be regarded as great have been left out, while others that might not be universally regarded as 'great' have been included.\\"<br /><br />At the beginning of the book, there is a list of more than thirty distinguished professors and academics who contributed articles.<br /><br />At the end of the book, there is a \\"Thinker Index\\" that lists the names of these great thinkers in alphabetical order.<br /><br />The articles for each thinker all have the same standard format consisting of seven parts:<br /><br />(1) The person's name.<br />(2) Birth date.<br />(3) Death date.<br />(4) A list of the person's major works.<br />(5) A summary of the person's major ideas.<br />(6) An essay of four to five pages explaining the thinker's most significant theories and indicating his/her place in the history of thought.  These essays are scholarly, lively, perceptive, and a fast read.<br />(7) A brief biography of further reading if more detailed information is required.<br /><br />Even though this book is over five hundred pages, it's possible to get through it in three to four sittings.  What I did was read the summary of major ideas for each thinker.  I noted the names of each thinker whose ideas intrigued me.  Then I read the corresponding essay of each of these noted thinkers.<br /><br />This book is also a good reference when you need information fast.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this book is that there is no indication either in the Table of Contents or in the Thinker Index of what each thinker's field is.  For example, a name indicated is \\"Isaac Newton\\".  Most people know he was a physical scientist.  But how about a name like \\"Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo?\\"  What field was he in?  All we know was that he was in one of the six fields indicated above.<br /><br />Thus, each name listed should have beside it the thinker's field of influence.  Therefore, you might have \\"Isaac Newton (physical scientist)\\" or \\"Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo (philosopher)\\".<br /><br />Finally, there is a sister book to this one entitled \\"Great Thinkers of the Eastern World\\" (1995) also edited by McGreal.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an informative book that gives readers pertinent information about influential people of the Western world.

In many cases, I wondered whether a particular reviewer read the same book as I did!  There seems to be some confusion as to the purpose of this book.<br /><br />I think the confusion stems from a lack of understanding of two terms.  \\"Suicide\\" is deliberately ending one's life.  It is usually an irrational act.  (For the record, I don't believe in irrational suicide.)  \\"Self-Deliverance\\" is the action of an irreversible ill person (such as a person who is hopelessly ill or is terminally ill) who makes a rational, voluntary decision to end his/her own life.<br /><br />The second of these two definitions is what this book is about.  In the author's own words: \\"Please respect the true intensions of [this book]: the right of a terminally ill person with unbearable suffering to know how to choose to die.\\"<br /><br />Thus, this book is not for the depressed, mentally ill, or suicidal.  The author elaborates:  \\"I ask people with suicidal thoughts to share them with family or friends and if this does not help, to call one of the hot lines or help lines listed in their local telephone books.\\"<br /><br />There is an argument that the above three types of people might use the information in this book for their own early demise (despite the book's warnings) and therefore it should not have been published.  But this is like saying tall buildings (or cars or bridges or etc.) should not be built because those with the intension of suicide might use them for an early demise.  The fact is a suicidal person will always find a way.<br /><br />Also, this book is not for the religious.  The author, again, elaborates: \\"If the reader of this book is deeply religious, and takes all guidance from a divinity, then there is no point in reading [this book].  [As well], all I [the author] ask of persons to whom any form of euthanasia [or assisted dying] is morally repugnant is tolerance and understanding of the feelings of others who want the right to choose what happens to their [dying] bodies in a free society.\\"  Thus, \\"this book assumes the reader's ethical acceptance of the right to choose to die when terminally ill and [so] the arguments for and against are not addressed.\\"<br /><br />This 27-chapter book covers all the practicalities involved in self-deliverance.  From the importance of certain documents, to the law, to consideration of others, to the pros and cons of various methods (including certain drugs), you'll find this book a compassionate and sensitive guide.  It contains clear instructions for supportive doctors and families so they can keep a person's dying intimate, private, and dignified.<br /><br />This book has four appendices.  I think most people will find Appendix A: \\"Glossary of Terms Connected with Dying\\" most informative.<br /><br />Finally, this is an excellent book for those (like me) who are interested in knowing more about this neglected subject.  The obvious fact is that we all die sooner or later.  Knowing some of the information in this book will help the reader understand and not deny that death exists.  As well, I learned about rights.  Some people want to endure every last minute of life no matter how painfully gloomy and that is certainly their right.  (In fact, there is a chapter in this book entitled \\"The Hospice Option.\\")  However, others do not want to endure pain and suffering and I think that should be their right.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book should not to be read by the depressed, suicidal, mentally ill, or the strictly religious.  For all other readers, it can be used as a practical guide or as an educational text to understand death and basic human rights.<br /><br />+++++assisted dying] is morally repugnant is tolerance and understanding of the feelings of others who want the right to choose what happens to their [dying] bodies in a free society.\\"  Thus, \\"this book assumes the reader's ethical acceptance of the right to choose to die when terminally ill and [so] the arguments for and against are not addressed.\\"<br /><br />This 27-chapter book covers all the practicalities involved in self-deliverance.

Most people know two of them and the third man is known as \\"what's his name.\\"  The same situation occurs when you ask people who shared the 1962 Noble Prize (in physiology or medicine) for their discovery of the structure of DNA (and other nucleic acid achievements).  Most people say, \\"(Dr.) Watson, (Dr.) Crick, and what's his name.\\"<br /><br />What's his name is Dr. Maurice Wilkins (1916 to 2004).  Most people are unaware that Wilkins was a brilliant physicist (he worked on the Manhattan or Atomic Bomb Project during World War Two) and later on was a biophysicist whose contribution was essential for discovering DNA's structure.  Wilkins states this more eloquently:  \\"[My] team of researchers at King's [College, a division of the University of London in the UK] laid the foundations for the double helix structure that Watson and Crick [both of whom worked together in a different UK laboratory] demonstrated so peruasively with their model in 1953.\\"<br /><br />Wilkins ten chapter autobiography is divided into three parts: those days before, during, and after the discovery of DNA's structure.  This book contains almost forty black-and-white photographs.  Wilkins' aim in writing this book was to tell his life story (that begins before he was born) and, perhaps more importantly, clear up \\"the tensions, accusations, confusions, and controversies that have attended the telling and retelling of the DNA story.\\"<br /><br />I felt that Wilkins was totally honest (and at times naive) throughout this book.  Some of the reasons I say he was honest are as follows:<br /><br />(1) He was an octogenarian when this book was published and thus I feel he had nothing to hide at this advanced age.<br /><br />(2) He reveals many aspects of his personal life that many people would be reticent to reveal, especially in print.  For example, he tells us he \\"felt a bit suicidal at times.\\"<br /><br />(3) He says many times that in retrospect \\"he should of\\" or \\"he could of\\" done things differently.  I got the impression that at times he was a bit hard on himself.<br /><br />(4) Finally, he tells us that both he and Crick found Watson's book \\"The Double Helix\\" (1968) \\"distasteful.\\"  They both protested to Watson's publisher.  (Wilkins said Watson's book was \\"badly written, juvenile, and in bad taste.\\")  As a result the book was not published.  (However, another publisher published it, and the rest is history.)<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Wilkins' book (at least for me) was the controversey surrounding Rosalind Franklin (1920 to 1958), an \\"x-ray [diffraction] specialist\\" who worked in the same lab as Wilkins.  He gives us detailed information of what occurred.  From other books (particularly the 1975 book by Ann Sayre), I learned that two major things occurred:<br /><br />(1) There was tension between Frankin and Wilkins.  I got the impression from these other books that this tension was due to personality and gender differences.  Not true.  Wilkins explains why this tension really arose and gives proof of his assertion.<br /><br />(2) Wilkins gave a critical X-ray photograph (a reproduction of it is included in Wilkins' book) taken by Franklin to Watson without her permission.  This photo gave Watson the concrete evidence for DNA's structure.  Again, this is not entirely accurate according to Wilkins.<br /><br />This critical X-ray photo brings up the question of the recognition Franklin should have received.  For example, would she have been a contender for the Nobel Prize?  I would say yes if this prize was only for determining the structure of DNA.  But, as Wilkins explains, he, Crick, and Watson DID NOT receive the prize for this!  I checked this out at the offical Nobel Prize internet site.  (Note that the inside front and back flaps of Wilkins' book incorrectly says they were awarded the prize for discovering DNA's structure.)<br /><br />Evenso, was Franklin recognized for her achievements and contributions at this time?  Watson and Crick did not recognize her for her achievements in their Nobel Prize lectures.  However, Wilkins did recognize her (as well as others who made major contributions) in his lecture. (Their actual lectures can also be found at the official Nobel Prize internet site.)<br /><br />Finally, I still have a few minor questions regarding Wilkins' story.  However, my major question is as follows: \\"Why did he wait half a century after the discovery of DNA's structure to tell his side of the story?\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this autobiography shows that Wilkins was a decent, honest, and brilliant scientist.  He also clears up any misconceptions regarding the discovery of the structure of DNA.  Be sure to read this book so as to learn the true story of Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins and the true story of the discovery of the structure of DNA!!<br /><br />+++++so, was Franklin recognized for her achievements and contributions at this time?

Or is he just on another planet?	+++++<br /><br />This book (first published in 1995) by Gene Brewer consists of sixteen chapters (or \\"sessions\\") and, as well, has a prologue, epilogue, and even a short glossary.  It is a novel that is very easy to read and that held my interest right to the end.<br /><br />The story is about a man who claims to come from the utopian world called K-pax (a planet \\"about seven thosand light years [away and] in...the constellation Lyra\\").  This man is the prot-agonist of this story and calls himself \\"Prot\\" (pronounced pr-OAT) meaning (on his world) \\"sojourner\\" or traveler.<br /><br />Eventually, Prot ends up in a mental institution and the psychiatrist who treats him is Dr. Gene Brewer.  (Notice that the doctor has the same name as the author.)  The entire book is mainly about the interaction between Prot and Dr. Brewer.<br /><br />When reading this novel, you'll find that Prot has wit, humor, and much knowledge (especially in sciences like astronomy and physics and in philosophy).  Dr. Brewer finds Prot quite rational and he later says, \\"I had never experienced a case like this, one for which I couldn't seem to find any handle.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Brewer asks his astronomy friends to formulate astronomical questions for Prot.  Prot answers all these questions (despite the fact that these answers were known only by a few eminent space scientists).  As well, Prot demonstrates certain otherworldly abilities.  Thus, both Dr. Brewer and the reader don't know whether Prot is indeed an extraterrestrial or a traumatized human suffering from \\"hysterical amnesia and delusion.\\"<br /><br />Prot has a positive influence on all people he meets especially on Dr. Brewer, his family, and other patients in the institution.  This gives the novel a certain warmth and charm.  Also, the author Brewer, through his character Prot, offers interesting social commentary.  My favorite is in the form of questions: \\"Is [K-pax] any duller than on Earth?  Whose inhabitants spend most of their lives trying to get laid, watching sitcoms on television, and grunting for money?\\"  Through his character of Dr. Brewer, the author reveals and explains certain psychological concepts.<br /><br />Suspense is created when Prot tells Dr. Brewer that he must eventually return to K-pax.  As well, even though all the other patients want to go with him to his utopian world, he promises that only one can come with him.  As the announced date of his \\"departure\\" approaches, the question asked by Dr. Brewer and his staff is as follows: \\"What will happen when this day arrives?\\"  As well, the other patients wonder whom Prot will choose to go with him.<br /><br />By the end of the book, most but not all of the questions posed throughout the novel are answered.  In other words, the novel ends on an ambiguous note.  (However, some readers may not find the ending ambiguous.)  In fact, the last sentence of this novel is by Dr. Brewer and reads: \\"And sometimes at night I go out and look up at the sky, toward the constellation Lyra, and I wonder...\\"<br /><br />Note that this novel is the first in a trilogy.  The next novel is entitled \\"K-PAX II: On a Beam of Light\\" and the last is entitled \\"K-Pax III: The Worlds of Prot.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the 2001 movie entitled \\"K-PAX\\" is good but not as detailed as the novel.  You don't have to read the book first in order to understand the movie.  However, if you want to understand the finer nuances of the movie, I recommend reading the novel first.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fascinating novel that will hold your attention to the end.  Dr. Brewer states that Prot's story \\"taught me about myself.\\"  I believe that Prot's story will also teach the reader about himself/herself!<br /><br />+++++ing to get laid, watching sitcoms on television, and grunting for money?\\"  Through his character of Dr. Brewer, the author reveals and explains certain psychological concepts.<br /><br />Suspense is created when Prot tells Dr. Brewer that he must eventually return to K-pax.

As well, the language involved in explaining these topics can be very technical but Rees manages to reduce the technicality resulting in a book that's easy to follow and thus that's \\"intended for general readers.\\"<br /><br />I agree that this deceptively concise book is written for the general reader.  However, for those not used to this kind of material, I suggest reading this book slowly since Rees cuts out extraneous detail.  Whether you are used to this kind of material or not, you'll find that this book offers a stimulating and accessible account of new discoveries, and perceptive insights into cosmology.  In fact, this book is so well-written, that according to Rees' internet site, this book is being considered for translation into twenty languages!<br /><br />Rees, in the last paragraph of this book, summarizes its contents: \\"A theme of this book has been the intimate links between the microworld and the cosmos...Our everyday world...[shaped] by subatomic forces...owes its existence to our universe's well-tuned expansion rate, the processes of galaxy formation, the forging of carbon and oxygen in ancient stars, and so forth.  A few basic physical laws set the 'rules'; our [universe's] emergence from a simple Big Bang was sensitive to six 'cosmic numbers.'  Had [any one of] these numbers not been 'well-tuned' [or precise enough], the gradual unfolding of layer upon layer of [the universe's] complexity would have been [suppressed].\\"  That is, \\"there would have been no stars and no life.\\"<br /><br />This book has a framework that is centered around the above six cosmic numbers or as Rees states: \\"[T]his book is the story of six [numbers] that are crucial for our universe, and our [that is, biological life's] place in it.\\"  What are these six numbers?  Three of them relate to forces in the universe (two of these numbers are basic forces while one of them deals with an \\"unsuspected new force\\"); one number is concerned with the basic \\"texture\\" of the universe; and two deal with the properties of space itself.  As already mentioned, all these numbers have a precise value that allow our universe (and us) to exist.  Rees asks: \\"Is this [precision] just...a coincedence?  Or is it providence of a benign Creator?\\"<br /><br />Besides learning about these six critical numbers, the reader will learn much more.  Some other things you'll learn about are antimatter, atomic structure, atoms, neutrinos, quarks, the periodoc table, the importance of hydrogen, deuterium, and helium, biological evolution, dark matter, black holes, cosmic background radiation, protoplanets and planets, galactic clusters, the strong nuclear force, extraterrestrial intelligence, particle physics, quantum theory, relativity theory, supernovae, and superstring theory.  You'll read about such people as Einstein, Arthur Eddington, Michael Faraday, Richard Feynman, Galileo, Newton, Stephen Hawking, Fred Hoyle, and Edwin Hubble.<br /><br />At the end of the book, Rees asks more questions: \\"Are there an infinity of other universes [called collectively the 'multiverse'] that are \\"badly tuned,\\" and therefore sterile?  Is our universe an \\"oasis\\" in a mutiverse?  Should we seek out other reasons for the...values of our six [cosmic] numbers?\\"<br /><br />My only minor complaint (and I'm nit-picking here) is that in chapter one Rees states the value of oneof these six cosmic numbers.  (It is a one followed by 36 zeros.)  Instead of expressing this number in scientific notation, he actually writes out all the zeros.  I reasoned that by doing this he was attempting to convey a sense of the immensity of this number.  However, in chapter three he does the same thing.  Why? Writing this long number out once was quite sufficient.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book offers an accessible account of the forces that shape -- everything.  You'll find this book to be an enjoyable and provocative intellectual adventure!<br /><br />+++++of these six cosmic numbers.  (It is a one followed by 36 zeros.)

You will not like everything equally, for your background, experience, education, and personal taste will incline you to prefer some [experiments] over others.&#34;<br /><br />These experiments were chosen by conducting a poll.  The author asked readers of a certain international science magazine what they thought were the most beautiful science experiments.  Then the author selected the ten most frequently mentioned candidates.  (By the way, the author admits that his &#34;poll, to be sure, was unscientific.&#34;)<br /><br />The ten experiments, from oldest to more recent, are as follows:<br /><br />(1) An ancient experiment that uses a shadow, a measuring tool, and junior high school geometry.  (&#34;It is so simple and instructive that it is reenacted annually, almost 2,500 years later, by school children all around the globe.&#34;)<br /><br />(2) A 400-year-old experiment that was demonstrated on the surface of the Moon in August of 1971 by one of the Apollo 14 astronauts.<br /><br />(3) &#34;The first modern scientific experiment [done by the same person of (2) above], in which an investigator...planned, staged, and observed a series of actions in order to discover a mathematical law.&#34;<br /><br />(4) A three-centuries-old experiment that the author describes as &#34;a landmark in the history of science [since it reveals a new aspect of nature] and a sensational demonstration of the experimental method.&#34;<br /><br />(5) &#34;A measurement experiment that stood out by [its] extreme degree of precision.&#34;  (The laboratory where this experiment was first performed was in the same lab where Watson and Crick discovered - many years later - the structure of DNA.)<br /><br />(6) This experiment was &#34;a classic example of the successful use of analogy in science.&#34;<br /><br />(7) An experiment that uses &#34;one of the simplest devices in science&#34; and enables you &#34;to watch the Earth turn.&#34;<br /><br />(8) A century-old experiment (actually a series of experiments) that was &#34;a defining moment in our electronic age.&#34;  (This experiment, in my opinion, was rather messy and not really that beautiful.)<br /><br />(9) An experiment that &#34;marked the birth of modern particle physics.&#34;  (This is my favorite experiment of these ten.)<br /><br />(10) This experiment's result &#34;is one of the most awesome and arresting human experiences.&#34;  (This was the most frequently selected experiment in the poll.)<br /><br />Throughout the book, two main questions are indirectly answered.  These questions are as follows:<br /><br />(i) &#34;What does it mean for experiments, if they can be beautiful?&#34;<br />(ii) &#34;And what does it mean for beauty, if experiments can possess it?&#34;<br /><br />(Both these questions, as well, are given thorough treatment in the book's conclusion.)<br /><br />Each of the book's ten chapters concludes with a short &#34;interlude.&#34;  Many of these interludes deal directly or indirectly with beauty in science.  For example, there are interludes that have the following titles: &#34;Why Science is Beautiful&#34; and &#34;Does Science Destroy Beauty?&#34;  But other subjects are covered in these interludes such as experiment versus demonstration and science & culture.  Be sure to read the interlude entitled &#34;The Newton-Beethoven Comparison.&#34;<br /><br />The last chapter has a &#34;Runners-Up&#34; interlude.  These are experiments that did not make it into the author's ten-best list.<br /><br />The conclusion of this book is entitled &#34;Can Science Still be Beautiful?&#34;  It details the author's &#34;personal candidate for the most beautiful experiment&#34; and, as already mentioned, gives comprehensive answers to the two main questions stated above.<br /><br />This book is very easy to read (and the 25 illustrations throughout this book aid in that ease) and assumes no science background.  You are given a wealth of historical and biographical information of all major persons involved in each experiment.  The only prequisite, I feel, that's needed to read this book is inquisitiveness and curiosity.<br /><br />What I especially enjoyed about this book is that throughout it we are given some examples of the actual writings of the experimenters (as well as those who admired them and those who did not).  One of my favorite writings is as follows: &#34;It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life.  It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch (artillery) shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.&#34;<br /><br />Finally, my only complaint is with the book's subtitle: &#34;The Ten Most Beautiful Experiments in Science.&#34;  Remember that the poll to obtain these ten experiments was unscientific.  Thus, I feel that this subtitle is unjustified and perhaps misleading.  Therefore, the book's subtitle should more accurately read &#34;Ten Beautiful Experiments in Science.&#34;<br /><br />In conclusion, this is somewhat of a unique book that attempts to explain how science can be beautiful and illustrates this idea with ten beautiful experiments.

US	45789111	R3A5DA5OQ6FEAK	0345303067	940144736	2010: Odyssey Two	Books	4	66	79	N	N	A Book that is Appeciated Differently by Different Readers	+++++<br /><br />This 1982 book (that consists of 55 chapters plus an epilog), by Sir Arthur C. Clarke (who \\"said for years that [a sequel] was clearly impossible\\"), is really a hybrid book since it attempts not only to be a sequel to his previous novel (\\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" published in 1968) but also attempts to be a sequel to the 1968 movie (also called \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\").<br /><br />In this novel, a joint Russian-American space mission is sent to the planet Jupiter (on the spaceship called \\"Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov\\")  to try and discover what happened to the previous American spaceship (called \\"Discovery\\") that was sent previously in 2001.  As well, Leonov's crew is \\"to locate the alien artifact [also called the monolith] encountered by Discovery, and to investigate it to the maximum extent possible.\\"<br /><br />Because this book attempts to be a sequel to the previous novel and the 1968 movie, it appeals to four different types of readers:<br /><br />(i)  those who have not read the previous novel and have not seen the 1968 movie<br />(ii)  those who have read the previous novel only<br />(iii) those who have seen the 1968 movie only and<br />(iv)  those who have read the previous novel and have seen the 1968 movie (as I have).<br /><br />Each of these four types of readers will probably rate this book as follows:<br /><br />(1) Those who have not read the previous movie or have not seen the 1968 movie will enjoy this novel.  Reading the previous novel or seeing the 1968 movie is not needed to understand this novel.  There is good character interaction and there is both known and speculative space science throughout.  (Examples of speculative science include the idea that gas giant planets such as Jupiter may have diamond cores and there may be aerial life forms in Jupiter's atmosphere.)  There are excellent descriptions of Jupiter and its moons (especially of the moons Io and Europa).  As well, this novel's climax (that occurs in chapter 52) is exciting and unexpected.<br /><br />These readers will probably give the novel a 5 star rating.<br /><br />(Note that these positive comments will apply to the other types of readers indicated below.)<br /><br />(2) The reader who has read the previous novel only will notice some differences that interfere with the continuity from the previous novel.  For example, Discovery is no longer orbiting one of planet Saturn's moons but is now orbiting one of Jupiter's moons.  (No explanation for this is given.)  Instead of the monolith being on one of Saturn's moons, it is now in orbit around one of Jupiter's moons.  (Again, no explanation for this is given.)  As well, the mystery and awe of the previous novel is replaced with the straightforwardness of this novel.  Many of the questions left open in the previous novel are now answered.<br /><br />These readers might give this novel 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />(3) Fans of the 1968 movie will have a stronger sense of continuity after reading this book than those who have only read the previous novel.  However, they may not recognize some of the dialogue that was said to exist (since it appeared in the previous novel only.)  The overwhelming mystery and awe of the movie is replaced with the straightforwardness of this novel.  However, many of the questions left open in the movie are now answered.<br /><br />These readers will perhaps give this novel 4 stars.<br /><br />(4) Those who have read the previous novel and have seen the 1968 movie might be a bit confused since they have to contend with what has been said in (2) and (3) above.  But with some reflection, they should be able to sort out this confusion.<br /><br />Possible rating by these readers: 4 stars.<br /><br />As mentioned in (1) above, there is quite a bit of true and speculative space science throughout this book.  Thus, this book would have different appeal to yet two more types of readers:<br /><br />(5) Those without space knowledge.  Such readers, I believe, would find this novel fascinating.<br /><br />These readers would probably give the novel 5 stars.<br /><br />(6) Those with some space knowledge.  These readers would also be intrigued with the novel especially the speculative space science.  However, they would be very dissappointed with the novel's climax (in chapter 52).  For this climax to occur, there would have to be sufficient mass (which there isn't).  Further, if this does occur (and it does in the novel), the novel would have to abruptly end since the spaceships (Discovery and Leonov) and Jupiter's moons would be instantly incinerated.<br /><br />Possible rating by these readers: 3 stars.<br /><br />The average of the above six ratings is 4 stars.<br /><br />Finally, there is the 1984 movie called \\"2010: The Year We Make Contact.\\"  It is a straightforward, traditional science fiction movie.  You don't have to read this book to understand this movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, this novel as Carl Sagan says is \\"a worthy successor to 2001.\\"  It appeals in different ways to different people.<br /><br />+++++d this novel fascinating.<br /><br />These readers would probably give the novel 5 stars.<br /><br />(6) Those with some space knowledge.

I find myself needing to withdraw during busy days to any place where I can have some privacy and relief from stimulation.<br />2. I am easily overwhelmed by things such as bright lights, strong smells, coarse fabrics, or sirens close by.<br />3. I get rattled when I have a lot to do in a short amount of time.<br />4. I startle easily.<br />5. I make it a point to avoid violent movies or TV shows.<br />6. Changes in my life shake me up.<br />7. When I must compete or be observed while performing a task, I become so nervous and shaky that I do much worse than I would otherwise.<br />8. I am very conscientious.<br />9. When I was a child, my parents or teachers seemed to see me as sensitive or shy.<br />10. I tend to be very sensitive to pain.<br /><br />If you answered true to five or more of these statements or if any one or two statements are extremely true of you, then this book may be for you.<br /><br />This easy-to-read, non-technical book (first published in 1996) by Dr. Elaine Aron, deals with the highly sensitive person (of which Aron is one).  Such a person is one that has a very sensitive nervous system and thus has a trait of greater receptivity to stimulation that may cause over stimulation.  This trait should not be confused with such things as introversion, shyness, inhibition, anxiety, or fear.  (Interestingly, there are also extroverted highly sensitive people.)<br /><br />This book provides basic, detailed information about this trait, data that is difficult to obtain elsewhere.  According to the author, \\"[This book] is the product of five years of research, in-depth interviews, clinical experience, courses, and individual consultations with hundreds of highly sensitive persons.\\"<br /><br />If you feel that you are a highly sensitive person, this book will help you understand yourself better and show you how to thrive in today's not-so-sensitive world.  Also, this book is written for those seeking to understand those that are highly sensitive, such as a friend, relative, employer, or educator.<br /><br />This book consists of ten chapters:<br /><br />*Chapter one helps one learn the basic facts about this trait and how it makes one different (not flawed) from others.<br />*Chapter two helps you understand your trait.<br />*In the third chapter, you'll learn to appreciate your highly sensitive body's needs.<br />*In the fourth chapter, you'll learn ways to rethink your past experiences in a positive light and gain greater self-esteem in the process.<br />*Chapter five gives insight of how high sensitivity affects non-intimate social relationships.<br />*Chapter six gives insight of how high sensitivity affects work relationships.<br />*In the seventh chapter, you'll find insight of how high sensitivity affects close intimate relationships.<br />*The eighth chapter deals with ways to heal the sometimes deep adult psychological wounds caused when one was a highly sensitive child or adolescent.<br />*Chapter nine gives information on medications and when to seek help. (The author advocates caution if you desire to use medication.)<br />*In the last chapter, you are introduced to techniques to enrich the soul and spirit.<br /><br />Near the beginning of this book is a self-test to help you decide if you are highly sensitive.  It consists of twenty-three statements (ten selected ones are presented above) of which you answer true or false.  (I felt that some of these statements were too general.)<br /><br />Throughout this book are voluntary activities that the author has found useful for highly sensitive people.  As well, there are tips throughout on how to deal with over arousal.<br /><br />Finally, there are three appendices that consist of tips for health-care providers, teachers, and employers who work with or employ highly sensitive people.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are highly sensitive or want to learn about this trait, then this is the groundbreaking book for you!!<br /><br />+++++t this trait, then this is the groundbreaking book for you!!<br /><br />+++++	2004-03-10

Clarke is the first installment of his \\"Odyssey\\" series of science fiction novels.  It is divided into six parts: (1) Primeval Night: six chapters (2) TMA-1: eight chapters (3) Between Planets: six chapters (4) Abyss: ten chapters (5) The Moons of Saturn: ten chapters (6) Through the Star Gate: seven chapters.<br /><br />This novel is classified as science fiction but is so much more.  It also has other elements such as the evolution of man, science, astronomy, computer science, extraterrestrial (ET) intelligence, and suspense.<br /><br />Evolution of man is the subject matter of part one of the novel.  Here you'll be introduced to ape-men and how they adapt to their environment.  Two major ape-men introduced are \\"Moon-Watcher\\" and \\"One-Ear.\\"<br /><br />Science is presented throughout the novel.  For example, \\"A man who weighed one hundred eighty pounds on Earth might be delighted to discover that he weighed only thirty pounds on the Moon.  As long as he moved in a straight line at a uniform speed, he felt a wonderful sense of buoyancy.\\"<br /><br />Astronomy is introduced throughout parts two to six.  Overall, Clarke gives good descriptions of our solar system, the asteroid belt, Jupiter, and Saturn.  All these are presented with a sense of wonder.<br /><br />Computer science is represented by the supercomputer HAL (which stands for Heuristically programmed ALgorithmic computer).  HAL was \\"the nervous system\\" of the Earth-built spacecraft 'Discovery' (which was piloted by astronauts Dave Bowman and Frank Poole).  \\"Without [HAL's] supervision, 'Discovery' would be a mechanical corpse.\\"<br /><br />Extraterrestrial (ET) intelligence is represented by the monoliths.  A monolith is first encountered by the ape-men.  Later, another monolith is encountered on the Moon (where it is called \\"Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-One\\" or TMA-1).  It is described as a \\"vertical slab of jet-black material, about ten feet high and five feet wide: it [resembled]...a giant tombstone.  Perfectly sharp-edged and symmetrical, it was so black it seemed to have swallowed up the light falling upon it; there was no surface detail at all.  It was impossible to tell whether it was made of stone or metal or plastic--or some material altogether unknown to man.\\"  A monolith occurs at two more critical times in the novel.<br /><br />Suspense is created when the astronauts have to go up against space, their own computer, and powers beyond human comprehension (presented in part six of the novel).<br /><br />Numerous examples of nature imitating the art in this book can be found.  For example, consider the saga of Apollo 13 in 1970.  The Command Module, which houses the crew, was called 'Odyssey.'  Just after the explosion that caused the mission to be aborted, one of the astronauts radioed back to Mission Control: \\"Houston, we've had a problem.\\"  The words that HAL said to the novel's astronaut Frank Poole regarding a similar event were: \\"Sorry to interrupt the festivities, but we have a problem.\\"<br /><br />Finally, this novel was written at the same time as the 1968 movie (which has the same title as the novel) was being made.  As a result, there is a close parallel between the book and the movie but there are some major differences.  In my opinion, a major difference is that the movie leaves out many of the explanatory details found in the novel.  Thus, the movie can be difficult to understand.  Therefore, I recommend the following: watch the movie first (to get an idea of its sheer wonder and don't worry about the details), then read the novel (to understand the finer details of the movie), and then watch the movie again (to get a greater understanding of what it is attempting to convey).<br /><br />In conclusion, this novel will present you with a unique, mind-bending experience.

WHERE IS EVERYBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A Book that Celebrates the Pleasure of Speculative Thinking	+++++<br /><br />As the author, physicist Stephen Webb states, \\"The purpose of this book is to present and discuss 50 proposed solutions to Fermi's [Paradox].\\"  Webb also states Enrico Fermi's (1901 to 1954) paradox (which he uttered in 1950) more eloquently as \\"the contradiction between the apparent absence of aliens, and the common expectation that we should see evidence of their existence...[in the form of] their craft or their probes or their signals [or even their artifacts].  We should not have to wait for evidence of their existence--the evidence should already be here.\\"<br /><br />This contradiction has a greater significance when the famous Drake equation is used to calculate the possible number of advanced civilizations in our Galaxy.  Webb does a calculation based on this equation (before he delves into the solutions to Fermi's paradox) and gets a number of one million.  (The late Dr. Carl Sagan did the same thing in his book \\"Cosmos\\" (1980) and came up with a number of ten million.)  Thus:<br /><br />\\"The Galaxy should be swarming with extraterrestrial civilizations.  Yet we see no sign of them.  We should already know of their existence, but we do not.  Where is everybody?  Where are they?  This is the Fermi Paradox.\\"<br /><br />This book (that has many black-and-white pictures as well as diagrams) is for the general, educated reader.  \\"One of the beauties of the Fermi Paradox is that it can be appreciated without the need for any [science or] mathematics beyond an understanding of exponential notation.\\"<br /><br />Forty-nine (specific) solutions (which are not intended to be exhaustive) are presented in chapters three, four, and five of this eight chapter book.  These solutions come from scientists in several different scientific fields and even science fiction authors.  As the author says,<br /><br />\\"[These are] my favorite [specific] solutions to the paradox; not all of them are independent, and sometimes I revisit a solution in another guise...In the discussion [of each solution] I will try to be as even-handed as possible, even if I disagree with the solution (which I often do).\\"<br /><br />The way these specific solutions are organized is around three general categorical answers.  These general answers that are for optimists, SETI (Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) enthusiasts, and pessimists respectively are as follows:<br /><br />(1) Chapter three contains 8 specific solutions based on the general answer that THEY ARE HERE<br />(2) Chapter four contains 22 specific solutions based on the general answer that THEY EXIST BUT HAVE NOT YET COMMUNICATED<br />(3) Chapter five contains 19 specific solutions based on the general answer that THEY DO NOT EXIST.<br /><br />For example, someone might ask Fermi's question of \\"Where is everybody?\\"  Picking one of the three general categorical answers presented above, a general answer might be \\"They exist but have not yet communicated.\\"  One of the 22 specific solutions presented in this book based on this general answer is that \\"We have not listened [for their signals] long enough.\\"  (This is the favorite solution of Dr. Frank Drake, co-founder of the SETI Institute).<br /><br />Chapter six contains the fiftieth solution to the paradox that is the author's \\"own view of the resolution of the paradox.\\"  Actually, what is presented is a numerical solution to the paradox that is based on some of the qualitative solutions presented in chapters three to five.<br /><br />Chapter one presents a general introduction to the topic and outlines the entire book.  The second chapter gives a brief biography of Fermi, discusses the notion of a paradox, and presents a brief discussion of the history of the Fermi Paradox (and, as well, gives a good discussion of the Drake equation).  Chapter seven presents as notes all the footnotes used in the book (that make for interesting reading in themselves).  The final chapter cites all the references that were used.<br /><br />I did findsome minor errors but listing these would be nit-picking as they do not distract the reader from the main message of the book.  For example, the math error that occurs in step five of the author's solution (chapter six) does not really matter to the author's overall result.<br /><br />I was, however, surprised by two things:<br /><br />First, the Fermi Paradox implies two obvious ideas: the aliens must be intelligent (if they are to build special craft that travel vast distances or to build sophisticated equipment to signal others of their presence) and they must have some kind of appendages that enable them to manipulate tools (used to build craft or equipment).  It would have thus been instructive to have a general discussion of both these topics near the beginning of the book instead of at its end.<br /><br />Second, after giving a good discussion of the Drake equation and praising the book \\"Rare Earth\\" which has the Rare Earth equation, the author chooses to ignore these equations and perform his own numerical calculation (which has elements of both the stated equations).  I feel, with the added insight gained from the previous 49 solutions, that he could have plugged in values into these two equations first before performing his own calculation.  A comparison of the final numerical answers would have been interesting and, I think, instructive.<br /><br />Finally, I recommend these two books after reading this one: (1) \\"Is Anyone Out There?\\" (paperback, 1994) by Frank Drake (2) \\"Rare Earth\\" (paperback, 2003) by Ward and Brownlee.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a unique book that presents the best discussion of the Fermi Paradox that I have encountered.

But in its most advanced form, it's called superstring theory.  This theory predicts the precise number of dimensions: ten.<br /><br />This book, which has a main narrative of about 330 pages, is divided into four parts:<br /><br />Part one (four chapters) develops the early history of hyperspace (which began in the mid-1800s), emphasizing the theme that the laws of nature become simpler when expressed in higher dimensions.  For example, in space-time, the laws of gravity and electromagnetic radiation (such as light) each obey a different physics and a different mathematics.  However, if a fifth dimension is added to the space-time continuum, then the equations \\"governing light and gravity appear to merge together like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.\\"<br /><br />The main conclusion of this part is that space-time is inadequate or \\"too small\\" to describe the forces that shape our universe.  When expressed in higher dimensions, however, there is \\"enough room\\" to explain these forces.<br /><br />The second part (five chapters) elaborates on part one's conclusion emphasizing that the hyperspace theory may be able to unify the four fundamental physical forces of nature (as well as their collection of subatomic particles) into one major theory (the so-called \\"Theory of Everything\\"), a unification that Einstein was unable to achieve.<br /><br />Hyperspace theory suggests the possibility that everything we see around us (such as trees, mountains, and stars) is nothing but vibrations.  \\"If this is true, then this gives us an elegant, simple, and geometric means of providing a coherent and compelling description of the entire universe.\\"<br /><br />Part three (three chapters) explores the possibility that, under extreme circumstances, space may be stretched until it rips and tears.  From this, we get the concept of \\"wormholes\\" or tunnels that link distant parts of space and time.  Thus, time travel via time machines that exploit these tunnels may be possible.<br /><br />Cosmologists have proposed the possibility that our universe is only one among an infinite number of parallel universes.  By analyzing Einstein's equations, they have shown that there might exist a web of wormholes that connect these universes.<br /><br />Although theoretical, hyperspace travel may eventually provide the most practical application of all: to save intelligent life, including ours, from the death of the universe by collapse.  In the last seconds of our universe's death, intelligent life may escape this collapse by going into hyperspace.<br /><br />The last part (three chapters) concludes with a final, practical question: If hyperspace theory is proven to be correct, then when will we be able to harness its power?  Answer: when our civilization develops the technical capability that enables us to harness the immense energy required for manipulating space-time or hope for contact with an advanced technical civilization that has already mastered hyperspace.  (Included in this book is a good discussion on extraterrestrial civilizations.)<br /><br />In the meantime, we can calculate the precise energy needed to create a \\"time-warp\\" (where space and time are twisted into a \\"pretzel\\") or to create wormholes that link distant parts of our universe.  This book ends by speculating on the level of technology that's needed for us to perform these feats, a technology that will make us \\"masters of hyperspace.\\"<br/><br />This is a history book, a storybook (that contains both true and hypothetical stories), a physics book, a mathematics book, and a book of scientific speculation.  All physics and mathematics is explained by analogy and with good diagrams.  This book as a whole is enjoyable to read but I found it necessary to slow down sometimes to grasp some major concepts.<br /><br />The only prerequisite needed to read this book, in my opinion, is the ability to visualize and to have an appreciation for the power of physics and mathematics.<br /><br />Finally, I recognize that some theories presented in this book have advanced since its 1994 publication but I feel that this book is an excellent starting point to become familiar with key concepts that are needed to understand more advanced topics.<br /><br />In conclusion, Kaku's final words in the book are as follows: \\"Some people seek meaning in life through personal gain, through personal relationships, or through personal experiences.  However, it seems to me that being blessed with the intellect to [understand] the ultimate secrets of nature gives meaning in life.\\"  This book exposes some of those \\"secrets of nature\\" and makes them understandable.  Thus I urge you to go beyond space-time and experience the hyperspace odyssey.<br /><br />+++++/><br />This is a history book, a storybook (that contains both true and hypothetical stories), a physics book, a mathematics book, and a book of scientific speculation.

This book divides these misconceptions into five parts.  All science is fully explained so the reader does not have to have extensive scientific knowledge.  As well, there are diagrams and black-and-white photographs to aid the scientific discussions.  Finally, there are recommended books and recommended internet sites for those who want to know more.<br /><br />Part one explains three misconceptions that occur in the home.  The second part deals with five misconceptions about the Earth and Moon.  Part three unravels eight misconceptions regarding things in the night sky (such as stars, planets, and meteors).  The fourth part is concerned with five bad explanations of various events (such as the Moon-landings and UFOs).  Lastly, part five is a special section covering three astronomy topics (such as bad astronomy in the movies).<br /><br />For those who have a science background (such as myself), don't feel tempted to skip a section because you feel you know the correct answer to a misconception.  This is because each chapter contains much important detail.  For me, I found that for those sections where I felt I knew the correct scientific answer, I still learned a lot because other interesting information was presented to enhance the discussion.<br /><br />Finally, I did find an error in the UFO section.  This section implies that no amateur astronomers have seen UFOs.

XXXXX<br /><br />This book (first published in Danish in 1998 then English in 2001) by Bjorn Lomborg has ignited a storm of controversy.  (In fact, his official internet site has received more than 150,000 hits since it began in mid-December 2001.)<br /><br />Opponents say that this book is inaccurate.  They say that his conclusion with respect to environmental concerns that \\"things are better--but not necessarily good\\" as compared to the past and that the environment will improve even more in the future is not accurate.<br /><br />As far as Lomborg himself, he is Associate Professor of Statistics in the Department of Political Science at Denmark's University of Aarhus (and a former Greenpeace member).  (Note that Lomborg has a Ph. D. in political \\"science.\\")  He admits that \\"I am not myself an expert as regards [to] environmental problems\\" but he had \\"experts\\" review the chapters of his book.  When I referred to this book's acknowledgements section, I counted about twenty names of people who might be called an expert.  For a book that discusses the large topic of the environment, I thought this number to be quite slim.<br /><br />Lomborg also admits that \\"it's...true that statistics can be used to manipulate the truth.  But used judiciously, statistics is the best source of information about our world...[and] the only way [in many areas] we can make a scientifically sound description of the world.\\"<br /><br />This book has a main narrative of about 350 double-columned pages.  There are over 2500 endnotes, over 1000 references, almost 175 figures (mainly line graphs and histograms), and almost ten tables.  This book is divided into six parts and each part is divided into sections.  (There are a total of 25 sections.)  On the environmental side, these sections cover traditional problems like food, energy, water, and pollution but also future problems like biodiversity and global warming.  Part one is a general outline of the entire book.  Part two to five present graphs of data with Lomborg analyzing and interpreting the graphs.  Part six is a summary and details the author's views and conclusions.<br /><br />Thus, when Lomborg says, \\"This book presents a lot of data,\\" he's not kidding!  Also, I should warn you that if you're not used to it, reading all this graphical data and Lomborg's explanations can be quite tedious and even boring.  Thus, I recommend reading this book at a slow pace.<br /><br />As you can imagine, a book like this draws much criticism and most of this criticism I've read has to do with the accuracy and amount of the book's content.  According to Lomborg's website, some scientific publications (with their associated experts, scientists, and university professors) that have given negative critiques of his book are as follows: Nature, Science, Scientific American, World Wide Fund for Nature, and the Danish Ecological Council.  Even the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty gave this book a \\"highly critical assessment\\" but this has been recently retracted.<br /><br />I recommend reading through this mass of criticism to understand what the controversey is all about and perhaps balancing what Lomborg has to say in his book with what others in their areas of environmental expertise have to say about his claims.<br /><br />Why is all this criticism coming from the scientific community?  Is Lomborg right and the scientific community wrong?  The answer to these questions is found in this book!  On the first page of part one, section one, the fourth paragraph states the following:<br /><br />\\"This book attempts to measure the real state of the world [with respect to environmental concerns].  Of course, it is not possible to write a [single] book...which measures the ENTIRE state of the world...I wish to gauge [WHAT I CONSIDER are] the most important characteristics [or indicators] of the world.\\" (My upper-case emphasis added.)<br /><br />This is the answer to the two questions above.  Lomborg is NOT measuring the ENTIRE state of the world but is only measuring the state of the world based on a relatively FEW indicators WHICH HE CONSIDERS MORE IMPORTANT than other indicators.  The environmental science community has data on the entire state of the world.  This is why when you read their criticisms of this book they say his data is not completely accurate SINCE DATA THEY CONSIDER AS IMPORTANT INDICATORS IS MISSING.  (For specific indicators, read the scientific community's criticisms in the sources indicated above.)  Therefore, in their view, this book is not really \\"Measuring the Real State of the World\\" (which is the book's subtitle).<br /><br />Thus, Lomborg seems to be right (that is, the environment is better) when he bases his analysis on a few indicators.  But when you base the analysis on all possible indicators, the scientific community is right (that is, the environment is not better).<br /><br />In Lomborg's analysis, he does, however raise many important ideas.  Here are three of my favorites:<br /><br />(1) \\"Prioritization [of worthy causes] is absolutely essential if we are to achieve the best possible [or most efficient] distribution of resources in society.\\"<br />(2) \\"We ought not to let [radical] organizations, business lobbyists, or the media be alone in presenting truths and priorities.\\"<br />(3) There should be more emphasis on the positive things that have been accomplished rather than dwelling only on the negative.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a controversial book that bases its conclusions with respect to environmental concerns on the analysis of a limited number of indicators.  Thus, caution must be used when applying these conclusions to the environmental state of the entire world.<br /><br />** 1/2<br /><br />XXXXXe ENTIRE state of the world but is only measuring the state of the world based on a relatively FEW indicators WHICH HE CONSIDERS MORE IMPORTANT than other indicators.

But to attain this paradise requires knowing certain principles and these are found in this book.<br /><br />What makes Canadian author Ernie Zelinski, who has an Engineering degree and M.B.A., an expert in this matter?  He was fired from his job at age 29 for taking an unapproved extended vacation.  For the next two years, he decided to make his purpose in life happiness without a job.  This happiness was attained through leisure and he now calls himself \\"Doctor of Leisure.\\"<br /><br />So what will you find in this book?  Zelinski explains, \\"I will share my thoughts about leisure along with a number of my experiences.  To give a much broader perspective to leisure, I am not drawing only on my own experiences.  A greater part of this book is the result of studying and listening to stories, experiences, and aspirations of other people...This book's format encompasses text, exercises, cartoons, diagrams, and quotations to appeal to the many learning styles that individuals have.\\"<br /><br />Another aspect of this book is the inclusion of letters from readers.  They describe how this book helped them to have a more exciting and rewarding life.<br /><br />This book is jam-packed with useful information.  Here are just ten examples of that information:<br /><br />(1) \\"Success in life's adventures doesn't come from having a huge advantage over others...the key is to acknowledge your own talents and use them.\\"<br /><br />(2) \\"Your ability to enjoy leisure time will be determined by how much you have been able to avoid being brainwashed by mainstream society.\\"<br /><br />(3) \\"This is the North American way: the majority view work with such respect that they boast how many hours a day they work...They have become martyrs, giving up the opportunity for self-actualization [through leisure] in return for the priviledge of slaving [in the workplace], which primarily benefits the company rather than themselves.\\"<br /><br />(4) \\"There is the common feeling that getting one's financial state in order will put the individual's other needs in order.  [Studies have confirmed that] the opposite is frequently true.\\"<br /><br />(5) \\"A concept involving a career of leisure will go against many of your friends' or aquaintances' instilled values.

That is, he has \\"attempted to re-create [his] first impressions of the relevant events and personalities\\" that he encountered along the way to making the discovery.  Thus, understand this is not a book of historical facts.<br /><br />Also, because of the personal nature of this book Watson states that \\"many of the comments [that he makes] may seem one-sided and unfair, but this is often the case in the incomplete and hurried way in which human beings decide to like or dislike a new idea or [a new] acquaintance.\\"<br /><br />This book revolves around five main people:<br /><br />(1) Dr. Francis Crick (1916 to 2004) of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England<br />(2) Dr. James Watson (born 1928) also of the Cavendish Laboratory<br />(3) Dr. Rosalind Franklin (1920 to 1958) of King's College, a division of the University of London<br />(4) Dr. Maurice Wilkins (1916 to 2004) also of King's College<br />(5) Dr. Linus Pauling (1901 to 1994) of the California Institute of Technology.<br /><br />However, along the way the reader meets many other people, both scientists and non-scientists.<br /><br />As Watson explains, the above five people are in a \\"race\\" to discover DNA's structure.  However, I got the impression that neither Franklin nor Wilkins knew they were in a race.  By the end of the race, Watson was \\"one of the winners\\" who shared the Nobel Prize in 1962 with Crick and Wilkins.<br /><br />According to the official Nobel Prize internet site, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won a shared Nobel Prize in physiology \\"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material.\\"<br /><br />This 29-chapter (with epilogue) book is a fast read (but only if you gloss over the science parts).  As Watson proceeds in this story, you'll find that he is quite sociable and takes us to such places as pubs, restaurants, and \\"smashing\\" parties.<br /><br />As you read this book, you'll find that there is considerable tension between Watson and Franklin (who was an expert in X-ray diffraction crystallography) as well as between Wilkins and Franklin.<br /><br />For me, this book imparts four major things:<br /><br />(1) THE THRILL OF DISCOVERY.  That is, this book effectively conveys, especially in the latter chapters, the struggle to find the correct answer.  With each chapter, the anticipation mounts toward the final climax: the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA.<br /><br />(2) HOW SCIENCE IS DONE.  For example, both Watson & Crick and Pauling used molecular models while Franklin & Wilkins used X-ray crystallography.  However, all science is not done as it is conveyed in this book.  As Watson states, \\"styles of scientific research vary almost as much as human personalities.\\"<br /><br />(3) THE QUESTION OF ETHICS IN SCIENCE.  For example, Wilkins told Watson secretly that Franklin \\"had evidence for a new three-dimensional form of DNA.\\"  When Watson \\"asked what the pattern [of this new form] was like, [Wilkins] went into the adjacent room to pick up an [X-ray diffraction] print [or photograph] of [this] new form [called the 'B' form]\\" and showed it to Watson.  This was done without Franklin's permission.  It turns out that this X-ray photo was critical and \\"gave several...vital helical parameters.\\"<br /><br />(4) WATSON'S HONESTY.  In all of this book, Franklin is portrayed as an unattractive, unapproachable, and angry person whose scientific work is questionable.  However, in the book's epilogue Watson devotes the last two paragraphs to her and her achievements.  He admits that \\"my initial impressions ofher, both scientific and personal...were often wrong\\" and that she was a person of \\"personal honesty and generosity\\" as well as of \\"intelligence.\\"<br /><br />Two good features of this book are that it has photographs (a total of 19) and diagrams (a total of 11) throughout.  My favorite photo is the one captioned \\"X-ray diffraction photograph of DNA, B form\\" taken by Franklin in late 1952.  My favorite diagram is captioned \\"Schematic illustration of the double helix.\\"<br /><br />This book was written for a general audience so they could experience the thrill of this revolutionary discovery.  Thus, I was surprised that it had no chapter table of contents (but the photos and diagrams each have one), no chapter headings, and no index.  I feel these would have made the book more user friendly.<br /><br />Also, I feel what was needed was a science glossary and name index/page.  The former is needed because the reader encounters many scientific terms (especially those related to DNA) and thus a glossary would make the science more accessible to the general reader.  The latter is needed because Watson encounters many people and a name index/page would have helped the reader keep track of these names.  Besides Watson talked with other scientists to clarify ideas, and in a way they indirectly contributed to the discovery.  Thus, a name index/page would have acknowledged their indirect contribution.<br /><br />Finally, in the epilogue Watson states, \\"All of [the major] people [in this book], should they desire, can indicate events and details they remember differently.\\"  Thus, I recommend these books:<br /><br />(1) \\"Linus Pauling: Scientist and Peacemaker\\" (2001).  In this book, refer to the science article entitled \\"The Triple Helix\\" which describes the race to discover DNA's structure.  Note Pauling's observations throughout the article.<br />(2) \\"Rosalind Franklin and DNA\\" (first published in 1975) by Anne Sayre.  This book clears up Watson's misconceptions about Franklin who died in 1958.<br />(3) \\"The Third Man of the Double Helix\\" (2003) by Maurice Wilkins.  Wilkins finally speaks out on what really happened from his perspective.<br /><br />In conclusion, Dr. James Watson tells us honestly his version of how the structure of DNA was discovered.  He effectively conveys the struggle to find the right answer and the thrill of discovery.  Don't deny yourself from reading this exciting book but be sure to read the recommended books to get the full story.<br /><br />*** 1/2<br /><br />***** ADDENDUM: April 23, 2013 regarding \\"The Annotated and Illustrated\\" edition of \\"The Double Helix\\" (published in 2012) *****<br /><br />All the problems I noted above for the above original 1968 edition of this book have been corrected with the new 2012 edition.<br /><br />Instead of simply listing the names of the numerous other people involved in the discovery (as I suggested in my review for the original edition), there are actual photographs of them.  Other photographs (many published for the first time) are also included.<br /><br />Many other documents not included in the original edition have also been included in this one.<br /><br />There are wonderful annotations (explanatory notes) in boldface type on each page of the new edition.  One annotation I found especially interesting was an explanation of where the nickname \\"Rosy\\" or \\"Rosie\\" came from.<br /><br />Included is James Watson's account of winning the Nobel Prize (first published in 2007).<br /><br />There are also five appendices.  Included in these appendices are reproduced letters written by Francis Crick and  Maurice Wilkins of why they DID NOT want Watson to publish his book.<br /><br />Lastly, there is a good index.  (The 1968 edition did not have an index.)<br /><br />Finally, I want to stress that Watson's original 1968 text is left UNCHANGED.<br /><br />In conclusion, in my opinion the 2012 edition of Watson's 1968 book will provide the potential reader with a more fuller reading experience with regard to this major scientific event.  Also, in my opinion, the 2012 EDITION DESERVES 5 STARS.<br /><br />XXXXXwho died in 1958.<br />(3) \\"The Third Man of the Double Helix\\" (2003) by Maurice Wilkins.

(The 1968 edition did not have an index.)<br /><br />Finally, I want to stress that Watson's original 1968 text is left UNCHANGED.<br /><br />In conclusion, in my opinion the 2012 edition of Watson's 1968 book will provide the potential reader with a more fuller reading experience with regard to this major scientific event.  Also, in my opinion, the 2012 EDITION DESERVES 5 STARS.<br /><br />XXXXX	2004-01-28

There are six principles discussed.  Cialdini calls these principles \\"weapons of influence.\\"<br /><br />Each principle or \\"weapon\\" has a well written and thorough chapter devoted to it.  Parts of these chapters are occasionally humerous.  As well, each chapter has plenty of examples to illustrate each principle.<br /><br />However, just knowing these principles is not enough!  You have to know the practical techniques or \\"compliance tactics\\" that are based on these principles in order to get the desired result of automatic compliance.  This book is packed with these techniques as well as examples of how they're used.<br /><br />Why bother to learn these principles and techniques?  Answer: to protect yourself.  Protect yourself?  From whom?  To protect yourself from \\"compliance professionals\\" (for example, sales people, fund raisers, and advertisers) who utilize these principles and their associated tactics to help them get their own way.  Where money is at stake, having them get their own way could be costly.  Cialdini suggests ways of thinking to defend yourself against such people after you realize a specific technique is being used on you.<br /><br />Of course, the compliance pros aren't the only ones who know about and use these principles and tactics.  We all use them and fall victim to them to some degree in our interaction with neighbors, friends, spouses, and so on.<br /><br />A handy feature of this book is the summary sections at the end of each chaper.  These effectively highlight the main ideas in each chapter.<br /><br />After reading this book, you'll be able to answer questions such as these:<br /><br />(1) Imagine you're a lawyer representing someone who broke his leg in a store and is suing the store for $25,000.00 in damages.  What would you do during the trial to make the jury see that this amount is reasonable, even a small, reward?<br /><br />(2) Why is the \\"free\\" sample really not so free?<br /><br />(3) What is there about written promises that make them so effective?<br /><br />(4) Which naturally occurring conditions of city life reduce the chances of bystander intervention in an emergency?<br /><br />(5) What is the evidence that we tend to say \\"yes\\" to similar others in an automatic fashion?<br /><br />(6) What is the relationship between size and status in our society?  Why did this relationship develop in this way?<br /><br />(7) During one mid-1980's Christmas season the most sought after toy in the U.S. and Canada was the Cabbage Patch doll, which was said to be in very limited supply.  Why were people reported to have spent as much as 35 times the regular price for this doll at public auctions to own a doll that cost much less at department stores?<br /><br />(8) How can each weapon of influence be used in an exploitive way and how can each be used in a non-exploitive way?<br /><br />In conclusion, don't be easy prey to compliance professionals!  Learn about the principles or weapons of influence and their associated compliance tactics.  Most importantly, learn the ways to defend yourself against such weapons and tactics.  This book explains all this and more!!<br /><br />+++++ature of this book is the summary sections at the end of each chaper.

I counted approximately 300 images.  Note that of these, about 25 are non-space pictures.  My favourite non-space picture is a cutaway diagram of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that shows its essential features. Each image or picture is accompanied by an excellent description of what's going on in the picture.<br /><br />This book's title implies that all the space images have come from the HST (named after the foremost U.S. astronomer Edwin Hubble, 1889-1953).  Actually, as the picture credits section reveals, the majority of this book's space images do come from the HST but a small minority of them come from other sources such as Earth-based observatories, artificial satellites (for example, the COsmic Background Explorer or COBE), and space probes (such as Voyager 2).<br /><br />This book is divided into six chapters that deal respectively with star birth, star death, galaxies, the expanding universe, solar systems, and our solar system's planets.  The appropriate pictures are put into each chapter.  For example, the first chapter on star birth contains about 35 pictures that deal with star birth.<br /><br />This is not only a picture book!  This book also gives an overview of astronomy.  That is, each chapter is accompanied by text that is concise, comprehensive, and well-written.  I learned much from the combination of Kerrod's lucid text and the magnificant pictures.<br /><br />This book also has a seventh section that is divided into two parts.  The first part explains details about telescopes in general while the second part discusses details about the HST in particular.  Both parts include informative pictures.<br /><br />What significant space event occurred in 1957?  When was the HST put into orbit?  The answers to these and other similar questions can be found in the section called \\"Landmarks in Astronomy.\\"  This section lists major astronomical landmarks that occurred between 585 BC and 2010 AD.<br /><br />Need to find the definition of an astronomical/space/telescope term in a hurry?  Then use this book's \\"Glossary of Terms.\\"  Such recent terms as \\"COSTAR\\", \\"proplyd\\", and \\"WIMP\\" are given excellent, concise definitions.<br /><br />There are two obvious problems I found with this book.  First, the text on page 162 is duplicated on page 168.  Second, there are no references/notes for the book's text.  Some of this text information is very recent and very factual.  Thus, it seems to me that this information should be properly referenced.  All of the pictures, however, do give credit to their sources.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want to learn about the universe and see its glorious wonders, then don't go out and buy an expensive telescope or pay the very large amount to be a tourist on the next Space Shuttle flight.  Instead, get this relatively inexpensive book and have the universe at your fingertips!!!<br /><br />+++++picture book!  This book also gives an overview of astronomy.

US	45789111	R236ITU99YR9A4	0385311222	212187147	Is Anyone Out There? The Scientific Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence	Books	5	6	6	N	N	No Greater Discovery for the People of Planet Earth	+++++<br /><br />This book tells us the fascinating history of the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI).  In addition, this is a science book, explaining the science that's needed to undertake such a challenging task (a task similar to \\"hunting for a needle in a cosmic haystack\\").  Lastly, this is an autobiographical book that profiles the life of coauthor Dr. Frank Drake (born: 1930), the first person in human history to use a radio telescope to search for other civilizations in space and who is now known as \\"the father of SETI.\\"  (The other coauthor of this book is best-selling author Dava Sobel).<br /><br />What struck me when reading this book (first published in 1992) was Drake's unyielding enthusiasm for the strong possibility of discovering signals from an extraterrestrial civilization.  In fact, he states, \\"This discovery...I fully expect to witness before the year 2000.\\"  The fact that a signal has not been detected \\"simply mean[s] that we [have] not looked long enough or hard enough.\\"<br /><br />Here's just some of what you'll learn about when reading this book:<br /><br />(1) Project Ozma (performed in 1960) which was \\"the first modern radio search for extraterrestrial signals of intelligent origin.\\"<br />(2) The creation of the Drake Equation in 1961 which is a \\"formula for estimating the number of advanced intelligent civilizations\\" in the Galaxy.<br />(3) SETI and the Soviets.<br />(4) Interstellar travel versus interstellar radio communication.<br />(5) The intriguing WOW! signal which was detected in 1977 (a signal that has never been repeated and is the best evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence).<br />(6) A radio message sent out by Drake and others in 1974 to hopefully be detected by other intelligent civilizations.<br />(7) What will happen if signals are detected and the profound significance of such signals for the people of planet Earth.<br /><br />In addition, this book has, what I call, a \\"SETI glossay\\".  Here, you'll find a list of defined terms that are unique to SETI.<br /><br />Also, there are three appendices.  In these, you'll discover that there has been nearly sixty projects or searches (up to 1992) for signals since the first project of 1960.  As well, I was amazed at how many respected scientists from many disciplines were/are connected directly or indirectly with SETI.  Some names include Carl Sagan, Freeman Dyson, Francis Crick (Noble Prize winner), Stephen Hawking, Fred Hoyle, and Linus Pauling (two-time Nobel Prize winner).  From seeing these names I thus have to agree with Drake when he says that \\"SETI is considered mainstream science.\\"<br /><br />There are thirty black-and-white photographs located near the center of the book.  Many are photos of those people who have been or now are deeply involved with SETI.<br /><br />Finally, the SETI Institute (located in Mountain View, California), as this book explains, was founded in late 1984.  Its \\"mission is to explore, understand, and explain the origin, nature, prevalence, and distribution of life in the universe.\\"  As well, this institute has a website making it possible for people who have internet access to stay up-to-date with what's happening in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you can obtain a copy of this unique book, you will discover that \\"SETI is...the most technical of scientific subjects, and also the most human.\\"<br /><br />+++++list of defined terms that are unique to SETI.<br /><br />Also, there are three appendices.

ANSWER: they all made immense contributions to society.  None of them married and most of them lived alone.  All of them craved solitude.<br /><br />This is the kind of interesting information you'll find in this book by noted psychiatrist Anthony Storr.<br /><br />Storr peppers his book with useful observations and insights.  Some of my favorites include the following:<br /><br />1) \\"Many human beings make so with relationships which cannot be regarded as especially close, and not all such human beings are ill or particularly unhappy.\\"<br />2) \\"With few exceptions, psychotherapists have omitted to consider the fact that the capacity to be alone is also an aspect of emotional maturity.\\"<br />3) \\"Those who are not too dependent upon, or too closely involved with, others, find it easier to ignore convention [and thus do not fear being original].\\"<br />4) \\"If we do not look at marriage as the principal source of happiness, fewer marriages world end in tears.\\"<br />5) \\"Some of the most profound and healing psychological experiences individuals encounter take place internally, and are distantly related, if at all, to interaction with other human beings.\\"<br />6) \\"The capacity to be alone is a sign of inner security rather than an expression of a withdrawn state.\\"<br /><br />Storr investigates the uses of solitude for ordinary people.  For example, \\"the capacity to be alone is a valuable resource when changes of mental attitude are required.\\"<br /><br />This book is at its zenith when it explores the connection between solitude and creative personality.  (In fact, I felt at times this connection was too thoroughly explored.)  Here, Storr gives mini-biographies of scientific and artistic geniuses, explaining how solitude may have been essential to their creative genius.  The principles derived from studying these solitary achievers are used to aid ordinary people.  For example, a useful principle is that \\"creative attitude and the ability to have peak experiences depends upon being free of other people; free, especially, from neurotic involvements, from 'historical hangovers from childhood,' but also free of obligations, duties, fears, and hopes.\\"<br /><br />Finally, throughout this book, Storr uses the insights of other psychlogists (for example, Carl Jung) to develop principles.  Also, various themes run throughout this book.  For example, \\"Man's adaption to the world is the result, paradoxically, of not being perfectly adjusted to the environment, of not being in a state of psychological equillibrium.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a book that discusses a neglected human need: solitude or the need to be alone.

An Understandable Defense of Darwinism	+++++<br /><br />This book (first published in 1986) by Richard Dawkins (born: 1941) explains and \\"fine-tunes\\" for the general but educated reader Charles Darwin's (1809-1882) Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection.<br /><br />This is not a definitive guide to evolutionary theory and the author explains this immediately: \\"This book is not a dispassionate scientific treatise.  Other books on Darwinism [that is, Darwin's Theory of Evolution] are, and many of them...should be read in conjunction with this [book].\\"<br /><br />What are the purposes and aims of this book?  They are numerous and some are as follows:<br /><br />(1) \\"To convey...the sheer wonder [or mystery] of biological complexity to those whose eyes have not been opened to it.\\"<br />(2) \\"To remove [the mystery of (1) above]...by explaining the solution.\\"<br />(3) \\"To persuade the reader, not just that the Darwinian world-view happens to be true, but that it is the only known theory that could, in principle, solve the mystery of our existence.\\"<br />(4) \\"To destroy [the]...myth that Darwinism is a theory of [random or blind] 'chance'.\\"<br />(5) To help readers make the \\"leap\\" in logic that \\"complex [biological] 'design' [can] arise out of primeval simplicity\\" and that this complex design is not due to a \\"supernatural deity.\\"<br /><br />(6) \\"To resolve the paradox\\" that even though natural selection appears to have an ultimate goal (like a watchmaker whose goal is to make a working watch), it, in fact, does not.  That is, \\"natural selection is the blind watchmaker.\\"<br />(7) To help the reader answer questions like the following: \\"Could the human eye have arisen directly from no eye at all, in a single step?\\" or \\"Could the human eye have arisen directly from something slightly different from itself?\\"<br />(8) To underscore the importance of animal genetics (DNA, RNA, protein, genes) and animal embryology.<br />(9) To explain gene and environmental adaptation interaction.<br />(10) To explain that \\"events that are...called miracles are not supernatural, but are part of a spectrum of...improbable natural events.\\"<br /><br />(11) To explain the importance of geological time that is measured in eons or \\"thousands of millions of decades.\\"<br />(12) To explain \\"that we don't need to postulate a designer in order to understand life, or anything else in the universe.\\"<br />(13) To explain that \\"all animals and plants and bacteria, however different they appear to be from one another, are astonishingly uniform when we get down to molecular basics.\\"<br />(14) To help the reader realize \\"that only natural selection can drive evolution in adaptive directions.\\"<br /><br />Dawkins in his very readable writing style fulfills all of these goals and, as well, he explains much more.<br /><br />There are two aspects of this book I especially enjoyed:<br /><br />(i) Dawkins selects certain anti-Darwinian arguments and analyzes them using the principles he has developed to show that they could not be true.  In this way, the reader gets to practically use the information that Dawkins has introduced us too.<br />(ii) This book is filled with examples of various animals (including humans) that have undergone evolutionary change.  These examples provide concrete validity to Darwin's theory.<br /><br />The last chapter of this eleven chapter book is my favorite.  It deals with rival theories to Darwinism.  Such theories as 'mutationism' and creationism are analyzed and commented on.<br /><br />There are three ways to improve this book so as to make reading it easier.  First, Dawkins, when he presents unfamiliar terms initially, defines or explains them in his narrative.  After this he assumes, when he presents these terms later on, that the reader will remember their definition accurately or take the time to look in earlier chapters to refresh his or her memory.  For myself, this assumption was false.  Thus a glossary at the end of the book would have been most helpful.  Second, Dawkins explains everything in word pictures.  I felt that clear, labelled drawings would have made key concepts easier to understand and decreased the amount of wordiness.  Lastly, most chapters contain numerous elaborations, recapitulations, and digressions.  I felt that each chapter could have been broken up into sections to accomodate this, thus allowing the reader to follow the discussion more easily.<br /><br />Dawkins says that \\"even if there was no actual evidence in favor of the Darwinian theory...[then] we should still be justified in preferring it over all rival theories.\\"  I disagree with this statement and was surprised that Dawkins made it.  The only reason this theory is preferred is that there is scientific evidence for it.  Accepting a theory on the basis of no evidence is called (blind) faith.<br /><br />Finally, Dawkins speaks of possible life elsewhere in the universe.  Thus, once you read this book, I strongly recommend the book \\"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe\\" (2000) by scientists Ward and Brownlee.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an excellent book that makes Darwin's Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection understandable.  The single most exciting idea that you can take from this book is that the diversity of life we see around us is not incredible, but inevitable.<br /><br />+++++ains everything in word pictures.

Its title...refers not only to our feelings for Dickens--and his toward us--but to my desire to make a complex figure more understandable and...friendly.\\"<br /><br />There is another reason for reading this book: so as to fully appreciate the novels written by Dickens.  As Epstein says, \\"Knowing the man behind the words does change [each novel's] significance.\\"<br /><br />Epstein fulfills her purpose admirably!!  Why do I say this?  Here are my reasons:<br /><br />(1) THE AUTHOR'S WRITING STYLE.  The author writes in a relaxed and leisurely but enthusiastic way such that Charles Dickens (1812-1870) seems to come alive.<br /><br />(2) THE BOOK'S ORGANIZATION.  This book progresses linearly from Dickens' birth to his death.  To do this, Epstein divides the book into three parts.  The first part is entitled \\"Early Life\\" and tells us about Dickens' life from 1812 to 1840.  Part two titled \\"Middle Years\\" goes from 1840 to 1855.  The third part called \\"Final Years\\" deals with his life after 1855.<br /><br />Along the way you'll find copious quotations from those who admired Dickens and his writings.  For example, guess what famous Russian author said, \\"If it were possible I would like to devote fifty minutes of every class meeting to mute meditation, concentration, and admiration of Dickens.\\"<br /><br />I found two sections particularly informative and enjoyable.  One of these sections is entitled \\"How to Read Dickens.\\"  It gives eight important pointers on how to get the most out of Dickens' works.  Another section is entitled \\"A Select Filmography.\\"  This section describes films inspired by Dickens' works.  These films are those made between the years 1895 and 2000.<br /><br />(3) DISCUSSION OF NOVELS.  Sixteen novels are thoroughly discussed throughout the book.  In part one, seven novels are given attention, most notably \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"Oliver Twist.\\"  Part two looks at five novels, \\"David Copperfield\\" being the best known.  The final part critically discusses four novels, most notably \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" and \\"Great Expectations.\\"<br /><br />Note that in part one there is also discussion of Dickens' first published book \\"Sketches by Boz.\\"  As well, this part also includes a glimpse into his book called \\"American Notes\\" that would later become \\"a public relations nightmare.\\"<br /><br />(4) BLACK AND WHITE ILLUSTRATIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS.  These are peppered throughout the book.  I especially liked the reproduced November 1994 cartoon from \\"The New York Times\\" that featured Newt Gingrich as Scrooge.<br /><br />(5) SIDEBARS.  These can be found throughout the book.  They highlight interesting bits of information that the author wants to bring to the reader's attention.  The sidebar that caught my attention was entitled \\"If You Liked the O.J. Simpson Trial, You'll Love Bleak House.\\"  In this sidebar, the Simpson trial is compared to Dickens' novel \\"Bleak House.\\"<br /><br />(6) INTERVIEWS.  These, too, are found throughout the book.  My favorite is an interview with a famous actor (hint: he played \\"Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise\\") who feels he must \\"read\\" the novel \\"A Christmas Carol\\" every year.<br /><br />(7) TRIVIA.  And lots of it!!  What I especially enjoyed was that there are complete sections devoted to trivia.

US	45789111	RSQRHCS1B2KYG	0451527984	22760455	The Inferno (Signet Classics)	Books	5	17	18	N	N	An Unforgettable Journey Through the Torment of Hell	+++++<br /><br />(Note: this review is for the book \\"The Inferno\\" translated by John Ciardi and published by Signet Classics in 2001.)<br /><br />This is book one containing part one (or \\"canticle\\" one) of poet Dante Alighieri's (1265 to 1321) three part \\"The Divine Comedy.\\"  This book describes Hell and the eternal suffering of the damned.  This poem is comprised of 34 episodes (or \\"cantos\\").<br /><br />Dante at the beginning of the poem explains why he has begun this journey:<br /><br />\\"Midway in our life's journey, I went astray<br />from the straight road and woke to find myself<br />alone in a dark wood.\\"<br /><br />Thus because Dante's life journey has led him \\"astray from the straight road\\" (that is, from the straight and narrow), he now finds himself \\"in a dark wood\\" (that is, in Hell).  Thus the journey through the nooks and crannies of Hell begins.  Dante takes this incredible journey with his master and guide, Virgel.  Along the way the reader along with the travelers encounters such things as mythical creatures and people, legends, people of Dante's time, biblical people and references, and human victims.<br /><br />Hell, according to Dante, has 4 complex parts:<br /><br />(1) The Gate of Hell<br />(2) The first 7 stone ledges or \\"circles\\"<br />(3) The eighth circle which consists of ditches<br />(4) The nineth circle with Satan at its center<br /><br />At the end of this long trek through Hell, Dante says, \\"My Guide and I crossed over and began / to mount that little known and lightless road / to ascend into the shining world again.\\"<br /><br />From here, they acsend \\"The Mount of Purgatory\\" (which is the subject of Book 2 containing Part 2 called \\"The Purgatorio\\").<br /><br />There is a historical introduction by Archibald MacAllister of Princeton.  It's imperative to have a good understanding of Dante in order to understand his poetic masterpiece and MacAllister does a good job of detailing Dante and his times.<br /><br />The late John Ciardi, former poet and professor at Harvard and Rutgers, translated this poem from its original 1300's Italian into English.  He retains Dante's three line stanzas and there is still much rhyming.  He not only relied on his own knowledge but leaned heavily on the knowledge of other scholars for his translation.  Some purists may not appreciate this translation but I enjoyed it.<br /><br />This is a narrative poem whose greatest strength lies in the fact that it does not so much narrate as dramatize its episodes.  It is a visual work that sparks your imagination.  This poem combines the five senses with fear, pity, horror, and other emotions to involve the reader.  The result: the reader actually experiences Dante's situation and just does not read about them.<br /><br />Ciardi's mini-summaries in italics before each episode gives a brief summary of what to expect.  His (foot)notes at the end of each episode highlight our understanding of key passages within each.  For me, Ciardi's mini-summaries and notes that accompany each episode are the cornerstone to understanding what Dante was attempting to convey.  As well, Dante can be challenging and tedious to read at times.  These mini-summaries and notes help the reader meet the challenge and overcome the tedium.<br /><br />There are five detailed illustrations in this book.  These illustrations as a whole detail the complexity of Hell.  They further increased my understanding, and, as well, added another visual dimension to this poem.<br /><br />I should mention the impressive cover art on this book.  It has a reproduction of the 1825 painting by artist William Blake of Dante and Virgil about to enter Hell's gate.  Above this gate is an inscription that reads: \\"ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE.\\"<br /><br />Finally, as I said this is a very imaginative poem.  Thus I recommend \\"The Dore Illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy\\" (1976) by Gustave Dore.  This book adds another visual dimension to this poem.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want to experience Hell as seen through the eyes of a gifted poet, then read this book.  Further, by reading this book, you will discover why this poem has endured popularity for seven centuries!!<br /><br />(published 2001;  translator's notes;  introduction;  34 cantos; 260 pages)<br /><br />+++++f you want to experience Hell as seen through the eyes of a gifted poet, then read this book.

The first part introduces us to the teenager named Alex who is the narrator of the book.  He is the leader of a small gang in futuristic England until he gets caught for doing the ultimate crime.  The second part has Alex or rather prisoner 6655321 in jail.  In prison, he undergoes an experimental procedure that cures him of his violence.  Part three details what happens to the cured Alex after he gets out of prison.<br /><br />A streak of grotesque surrealism runs through this book especially in part one.  For example, as the gang of hoodlums drive to their \\"surprise visit,\\" they run over a big, snarling toothy thing that screams and squelches, and as they drive back they run over \\"odd squealing things\\" all the way.<br /><br />The most fascinating aspect of this book is the invented vocabulary or futuristic, teenage slang -- it has the effect of putting you in another world.  Alex thinks and talks in this slang.  A doctor in this book explains it: \\"Odd bits of old rhyming slang.  A bit of gypsy talk, too.  But most of the roots are Slav [or Russian] propaganda.\\"<br /><br />Alex as he narrates translates some of this slang.  I found that it is best to compile a running glossary so as to make later reading easier.<br /><br />At first the vocabulary seems incomprehensible: \\"you could peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom or one or two other veshches.\\"  Then, the reader discovers that some of the meaning is clear from context: \\"to tolchock some old veck in an alley and viddy him swim in his own blood\\" or \\"I kicked the chelloveck in the yarbles and he began to platch.\\"  The meaning of other words become known after a second context.  For example, when Alex kicks someone in the \\"gulliver\\" it might be any part of the body, but when a glass of beer is served with a gulliver, we then can deduce this word's meaning.  The meaning of other words becomes obvious as the reader progresses through the book.<br /><br />Another fascinating thing about this book is its contrasts.  For example, violence is connected with symphonic music especially the music of \\"Ludwig van.\\"<br /><br />This book is packed with various themes.  The prison charlie or chaplain exposes the central theme of the book in a series of questions to prestoopnick or prisoner 6655321: \\"What does God want?  Does God want goodness or choice of goodness?  Is the man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than the man who has the good imposed on him?\\"<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick's movie of the same name catches the book's essence.  However, the movie does not entirely get across the futuristic, nadsat or teenage slang so evident in the book.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a new kind of book.  I can't say I've read another like it.  But I can say that this book contains *** a zammechat razkazz that works for me!!  (For a translation, refer to the title of this review.)<br /><br />+++++book.<br /><br />Another fascinating thing about this book is its contrasts.

The word \\"confession\\" means to admit.  What the late Dr. Robert Mendelsohn does is to admit truths about what he calls the \\"Church of Modern Medicine.\\"  A \\"heretic\\" is a person who professes to heresy.  A heresy is any opinion opposed to established doctrines.<br /><br />Thus, Mendelsohn in his book tells us truths and his opinions (based on his excellent qualifications) regarding orthodox medicine.  His opinions are angry ones.  (I'd be angry too if I spent my entire life in orthodox medicine only to discover that it is not what it claims to be.)  Like anyone who is angry, the author occasionally goes off on tangents but overall he sticks to the main premise of the book.<br /><br />What is the premise of this book?  Mendelsohn tells us this immediately in the book's opening section called the \\"Non Credo.\\"  He states, \\"I do not believe in modern medicine.  I am a medical heretic.  My aim of this book is to persuade you to become a heretic, too.\\"  (Notice, that contrary to popular belief, the premise of this book is not to tell you to stop seeing your doctor.)<br /><br />Each chapter (there are nine) of this book has many truths.  These truths are not out-of-date and will probably remain relevant into the far future.  Here are just three examples:<br /><br />1) \\"Every drug stresses and hurts your body in some way.\\"<br />2) \\"A healthy society is characterized by strong, positive family relationships and subsequent minimal need of doctors.\\"<br />3) \\"Doctors are not trained to attack the core of any problem, merely to suppress symptoms.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes, the author juxtaposes two truths to make a point.  My favorite: \\"All their [that is, doctors'] intentions may be good, but we all know what the road to Hell is paved with.\\"<br /><br />What I really noticed about this book is the author's strong opinions.  Here, again, are three examples:<br /><br />1) \\"Doctors in general should be treated with the same degree of trust as used-car salesmen.\\"<br />2) \\"When I meet a doctor, I generally figure I'm meeting a person who is narrow-minded, prejudiced, and fairly incapable of reasoning and deliberation.\\"<br />3) \\"Get used to the idea right away that no single system can or should claim to have an exclusive fix on the dynamics of health.\\"<br /><br />There is even discussion about non-drug medicine.  Mendelsohn states, \\"In the Church of Modern Medicine, the doctor who treats without drugs is regarded as a heretic because he or she appears to have rejected the sacrament of medication.\\"  Today, orthodox medicine calls such people \\"quacks.\\"  One of the people they call a quack, the author mentions, is Dr. Linus Pauling because he wanted to treat without drugs.  The late Linus Pauling was a two-time Nobel Prize winner.  Question:  What gives orthodox medicine the right to call such a brilliant person a quack?  His credentials prove otherwise.<br /><br />The book's last section is called, \\"Epilog: In search of the New Doctor.\\"  It is an interesting section where Mendelsohn gives his vision of the doctor of the future.  This vision has yet to be achieved and my guess is, it will never be achieved.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this book is the lack of footnotes with respect to specific numbers and statistics.  When statistics are given, you have to give credit to their source.  However, Mendelsohn does supply many references.<br /><br />Another good book on this subject that is less opinionated is \\"The Medical Mafia\\" (1995) by Dr. Guylaine Lanctot.  I think this title is a good indicator of its contents.<br /><br />In conclusion, Dr. Robert Mendelsohn's book does a good job in exposing the truths behind orthodox medicine.  These truths are what you and your family should know for their own protection.  I strongly recommend this book if you want to become aware of these truths.<br /><br />**** 1/2<br /><br />+++++d with the same degree of trust as used-car salesmen.\\"<br />2) \\"When I meet a doctor, I generally figure I'm meeting a person who is narrow-minded, prejudiced, and fairly incapable of reasoning and deliberation.\\"<br />3) \\"Get used to the idea right away that no single system can or should claim to have an exclusive fix on the dynamics of health.\\"<br /><br />There is even discussion about non-drug medicine.

US	45789111	R1DACANH5R545Q	0393320448	392718393	Rosalind Franklin and DNA	Books	5	38	40	N	N	The Forgotten Heroine of the Double Helix	+++++<br /><br />I read Dr. James Watson's \\"The Double Helix\\"(1968) years ago.  In it, he badly caricatured Dr. Rosalind Franklin (1920-1958) by systematically stereotyping her.  (However, in his book's epilogue he does admit that his initial impressions of her were often wrong.)<br /><br />I forgot about this until I read the late Dr. Linus Pauling's \\"How to Live Longer and Feel Better\\" (1986).  In the 'About the Author' section I read the following: \\"Watson and [Dr. Francis] Crick [both of whom worked in the Cavendish lab at Cambridge University, England] proposed the double-helix structure, which turned out to be correct.  Watson and Crick had the advantage of X-ray [diffraction] photographs of DNA taken by Rosalind Franklin [who worked in a lab at King's College, a division of the University of London], an advantage denied Pauling [who worked overseas in a U.S. lab].\\"<br /><br />Years later I read \\"Linus Pauling: Scientist and Peacemaker\\" (2001).  One science article in this book called \\"The Triple Helix\\" said Pauling saw Franklin as \\"a talented young crystallographer [a scientist who is expert in structure and properties of crystals]\\" and that he had great admiration for her abilities.  It also states that \\"[Dr. Maurice] Wilkins [the scientist who 'worked with' Franklin at King's College] was not...well trained in [the] interpretation of X-ray photos [like Franklin was].\\"<br /><br />Thus, my interest was aroused!!  I wanted to learn more about Franklin.  I thus chose Anne Sayre's book for two reasons:<br /><br />(1) It was originally published in 1975, just over 15 years after Franklin's death meaning the memories of events were still relatively fresh in people's minds and key people were still alive.  (Contrast this to a book written in 2002, ALMOST 45 YEARS after Franklin's death.  Are people's memories still reliable and are all key people still alive?)<br /><br />(2) Since Sayre was Franklin's friend, she would be privy to information that only friends could share.<br /><br />Sayre's book has many good features:<br /><br />(1) ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS SECTION.  In it she stated that she interviewed many scientists and/or their wives as well as significant others that were still alive.  She also had access to her scientist husband (who was also a crystallographer) as well as Franklin's mother and friends.<br /><br />I was surprised that Wilkins and Watson both consented \\"to lengthy and frank interviews.\\"  Crick also consented.<br /><br />Knowing all this quelled my trepidation that this book would somehow be biased and inaccurate.<br /><br />(2) THE BOOK'S INTRODUCTION (chapter 1).  Here she tells us why she wrote this book.  It was in response to Watson's caricature of Franklin in his 1968 book.  Sayre states, \\"[She] was not recognizable as Rosalind Franklin.  She was recognizable as something else not related to the facts.\\"<br /><br />Sayre also states that her book is more than just a biography since \\"biography is too cruel a word to use in connection with a life which was over long before it was finished.\\"<br /><br />(3) THE BOOK'S CONTENT (chapters 2 to 11).  These chapters give a good, detailed description of Franklin.  These chapters can be divided into three parts.  In these parts the author describes the science Franklin was involved in.  Sayre does a good job in making the science understandable.  These parts also touch on other things such as science ethics and communication, the nature of science, psychology, and sexism in science.  As well, included are copies of Franklin's critical lab notes and transcriptions of interviews with key people.<br /><br />Part I includes chapters 2 and 3.  This part give insight into Franklin's character, her education, significant people she met, and much more.  It covers the years from 1920 to 1950.<br /><br />Part II includes chapters 4 to 9.  It covers the years from 1951 to early 1953.  These were the years she worked in DNA research.<br /><br />The major event that transpired during these years was that Wilkins (and others) passed Franklin's data and her X-ray photos of DNA (especially the X-ray photo of the alternative or 'B' form of DNA) to Watson and Crick without her permission, and this critical information enabled them to determine the structure of DNA. (Pauling's structural model was inadequate because, as mentioned, he did not have access to these photos.)<br /><br />Part III encompasses chapters 10 and 11.  It covers the years from mid-1953 to Franklin's death from cancer in 1958.  During this time, she worked at a different lab on tobacco virus research and later, on polio virus research.<br /><br />(4) THE BOOK'S AFTERWORD SECTION.  This section discusses various issues vigorously.  Some examples of what's discussed include the importance of Franklin's discoveries, what might have been if she had not died so young, how poorly Watson's book portrayed her, and more.<br /><br />(5) NOTES.  There are over ten pages of footnotes at the end of the book.  These contain REVEALING information that never made it into the main narrative.<br /><br />(6) PAULING'S BOOK ENDORSEMENT.  This two-time Nobel Prize winner states his endorsement on the book's back cover.  I think this speaks volumes for the book's quality!<br /><br />It's good to know that Rosalind Franklin is now being honored posthumously and her reputation is being restored as part of a government crusade against sexism in science.  Also, as of 2002, the \\"Franklin Medal\\" is awarded in her honor to exceptional women scientists.<br /><br />Finally, besides the books mentioned above, I recommend reading \\"The Third Man of the Double Helix\\" (November 2003) by Maurice Wilkins to get his side of this story.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want to learn about a gifted female scientist and know the true story of the discovery of DNA's structure, then read this fascinating and honest book!!!<br /><br />+++++uring these years was that Wilkins (and others) passed Franklin's data and her X-ray photos of DNA (especially the X-ray photo of the alternative or 'B' form of DNA) to Watson and Crick without her permission, and this critical information enabled them to determine the structure of DNA.

Flach tells us that it is \\"the strengths we require to master cycles of disruption [emotional upset caused by stressful events such as a family death, divorce, or job loss] and reintegration [putting the pieces of our life back together] throughout our lives.\\"  This book offers simple and practical advice on HOW to perfect those strengths that we all have within us.<br /><br />In this book, some of the things you will discover are as follows:<br /><br />(1) Over a dozen traits that will make you more resilient<br />(2) Why giving into stress and \\"falling apart\\" may be the best step to take on the road to resilience<br />(3) Why the use of prescription drugs may not be the best choice in removing the psychological pain caused by stress<br />(4) Why creative problem solving is a major part of resilience<br />(5) The factors in our environment needed to facilitate resilience.<br /><br />A remarkable quality of this book is that it is easy to read and thus easy to learn from.  There is no confusing technical psychobabble.  The most interesting aspect of this book is that Flach uses some of his actual patient studies to illustrate his practical advice.

This Book May Change Your Life!!	+++++<br /><br />This book's contents can be summarized in one sentence: it outlines a life-changing philosophy and plan for financial independence.<br /><br />However, this summary does not give credit to the number of  features that enhance this riveting book.  Some of these features are as follows:<br /><br />(1) THE AUTHORS LIVE WHAT THEY TEACH.  For example, one of the authors, the late Joe Dominguez was a financial analyst on Wall Street before taking an early retirement (at age thirty-one).  Did he make a killing on Wall Street that enabled him to do this?  No!  What he did was to decide to take back his life by gaining control of his money and eventually gain financial independence through a nine-step program.<br /><br />(2) A MULTI-DISCIPLINE BOOK.  As mentioned, part of the magic of this book is that it teaches a life-changing philosophy.  But within this philosophy you'll find other areas such as finance, economics, history, simple mathematics, environmental science, psychology, and spirituality.  All these are blended together to form an interesting and instructional narrative.<br /><br />A cornerstone of this book's philosophy is the following equation: MONEY = LIFE ENERGY.  That is, you have to work or expend energy to make money.  Most people see their life energy as precious.<br /><br />(3) PRACTICAL ADVICE.  Practical advice on how to save money can be found throughout this book.  But the truly practical and another magical part of this book is its NINE-STEP PROGRAM.  Readers have a chance to peruse the final, workable form of this program that leads to financial independence.  (Financial independence as defined by this book is the amount of money that is ENOUGH for you or you and your family.)<br /><br />A highlight of this program is that you only have to WORK FOR A FINITE PERIOD OF TIME.<br /><br />A cornerstone of this practical advice, besides the nine-step program, is FRUGALITY.  Don't worry!  Frugality does not mean budgeting.<br /><br />(4) DIAGRAMS.  This book has many diagrams, charts, and tables.  These help the reader gain a concrete understanding of all concepts introduced.<br /><br />(5) REAL-LIFE STORIES.  This book is permeated with real stories of ordinary people who have decided to follow the nine-step program.  What I found interesting when reading these stories is their reasons as to exactly why they decided to follow the program.<br /><br />(6) END-OF-CHAPTER SUMMARIES AND CHECKLISTS.  These summaries highlight the major concepts introduced in the chapters.  Many chapters also have a handy checklist.<br /><br />(7) THE EPILOGUE.  This is really an end-of-book summary.  The steps of the nine-step program are summarized for review, reference, and reminders.  The idea here is to read the corresponding chapter for further details.  This summary comes in very handy!<br /><br />(8) REFERENCES (or resources) and NOTES.  There are a large number of notes (footnotes allocated to the back of the book) and many useful references.<br /><br />(9) FINAL WORDS.  Many people would not consider this a feature of this book but I think the fact that the authors were able to end the main narrative of the book with these important words indicates that the book was well planned out.  These words are as follows:  \\"There is more to life than nine-to-five.\\"<br /><br />Finally, the book's authors advocate that when you build up savings that you invest in long-term bonds.  Critics (mainly investment \\"experts\\") who have read this book say that the rate of return on more aggressive but risky investment vehicles (such as stocks) provide a higher rate of return in the long term.  What they fail to realize is that the authors are talking about investing your money in vehicles that will give you a STABLE and CONSISTENT monthly income that you can live off.<br /><br />In summary, this book creates an awareness of how you are spending your money and your precious life energy.  It is that awareness that will transform your dealings with money and lead to financial<br />independence.<br /><br />In conclusion, those who do not value their life energy need not get this book.  But for those who do value their life energy, this inspiring and unique book is your essential guide!!<br /><br />+++++ealings with money and lead to financial<br />independence.<br /><br />In conclusion, those who do not value their life energy need not get this book.

These short essays were written between 1925 and 1935.<br /><br />Russell writes in an elegant, readable, and understandable style.  His arguments are well thought out.<br /><br />These essays consider social questions not discussed in politics.  The general theme that ties these essays together is that the world suffers from dogmatism and narrowness; what is needed is the willingness to question dogma.<br /><br />These essays are a blend of philosophy with other disciplines such as psychology, economics, science, and history.  All the essays are brutally honest and forthright.  Each is packed with loads of wisdom.  What's amazing is that these essays are as current today as when they were first written and their messages will probably remain relevant in the future.<br /><br />My five favorite essays in this collection include the following:<br /><br />(1) \\"In Praise of Idleness.\\"  Discusses work and the importance of leisure.  In order to get an idea of Russell's insight that permeates this book, here's a sample sentence from this essay: \\"The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.\\"<br /><br />(2) \\"'Useless' Knowledge.\\"  Points out that all knowledge is useful not only that which has a practical value.<br /><br />(3) \\"The Case for Socialism.\\"  Russell gives many arguments in favor of socialism, most notably the need for preventing war.<br /><br />(4) \\"Western Civilization.\\"  Discusses its characteristics.  Sample sentence: \\"I cannot escape from the conclusion that the great ages of progress have depended upon a small number of individuals of transcendent utility.\\"<br /><br />(5) \\"Education and Discipline.\\" Sample sentence: \\"Education...must be something more positive than mere opportunity for growth...it must...also provide a mental and moral equipment [for] children.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is Bertrand Russell at his best. Enjoy!<br /><br />+++++and moral equipment [for] children.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this book is Bertrand Russell at his best. Enjoy!<br /><br />+++++	2003-11-05

Guess what?  I DID read it from cover to cover!!<br /><br />Why did I do this?  Here are my reasons:<br /><br />(1) THE AUTHOR'S WRITING STYLE.  The author, Norrie Epstein, writes in a relaxed and leisurely but enthusiastic way making a somewhat difficult subject easy and enjoyable to read.  She writes for the intelligent, common reader who's tired of technical, academic (and patronizing!!) jargon.<br /><br />(2) THE BOOK'S ORGANIZATION.  The book progresses logically with general comments on the works of William Shakespeare (1564-1616) to discussing the man himself to looking at the Elizabethan stage and then lastly discussing the plays.  There is also a discussion of the Shakespearean sonnets.  Finally,  there is a fascinating end-discussion on the spin-offs that have resulted from Shakespeare's works (for example, music and films).<br /><br />(3) DISCUSSION OF PLAYS.  Not only are the popular ones discussed but the more obscure plays are also given attention.  The plays discussed are as follows: eight romantic comedies, eight histories, one \\"problem\\" play, seven tragedies, and one tragicomic romance.  All discussions are EASY to follow.  And don't worry.  There are NO boring plot summaries of the plays to read.<br /><br />For many of the plays, there is a \\"What to Look For In\\" section.  These informative sections highlight what is particularly significant in a play.  As well, a major Shakespearean character of a particular play may be highlighted and given more detailed attention.  For example, there are good, solid discussions of Shylock and Falstaff.<br /><br />(4) ILLUSTRATIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS.  These are peppered throughout the book.  I especially liked the black-and-white photo of Patrick Stewart (\\"Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise\\") dressed up as Shylock.<br /><br />(5) SIDEBARS.  These also occur throughout the book.  They highlight interesting bits of information that the author wants to bring to the reader's attention.  One of my favorite sidebars is an open letter a critic of the 1600s wrote to Shakespeare entitled \\"As I Don't Like It.\\"  He commented on why he didn't like the play \\"As You Like It\\" (one of the Bard's best plays).<br /><br />(6) INTERVIEWS.  These are scattered throughout the book.  The author interviews people (such as actors) who have a passion for Shakespeare.  Notable interviews are with Kenneth Branagh and Ted Lange (of \\"Love Boat\\" fame).<br /><br />(7) TRIVIA.  And lots of it!!  This Shakespearean trivia occurs throughout the book.  For example, what does Shakespeare's epitaph say?  Or, what Shakespearean character was Orson Welles' life ambition to play?<br /><br />Finally, the big question: who is this book written for?  Answer: for both novices and Shakespearean scholars--in short, everybody who is interested in the Bard.<br /><br />I must confess that I thought I knew a lot about Shakespeare and his works.  Was I wrong!!  This book opened my eyes to how much I did not know.<br /><br />In conclusion, after you read this book, you'll probably be like me and say, \\"What a piece of work was this man William Shakespeare!\\"<br /><br />+++++e also occur throughout the book.

So I went to the References (the author calls it \\"Further Reading\\") section.  I was surprised to learn that there were NO references for this chapter!  Where did the author get the information for this chapter? My interest was aroused!!<br /><br />What I did was survey the reference section to see how many references each chapter had.  (I excluded chapter 15 but included both appendices in my survey.)  Each chapter should have a MINIMUM of three to four references.<br /><br />I found that about 40% of the book had an inadequate number of references (in fact, two chapters had NO references) and about 30% of the book had a minimal number of references!<br /><br />The bottom line is that about 70% of this book is poorly referenced!!!<br /><br />The following highlights other problems:<br /><br />(1) THE BOOK'S TITLE.  I interpreted the term 'Strange Brains' in the book's title to mean that the book was to describe the physical structures of genius' brains.  I was disappointed to find that in the book's preface it states, \\"this book will not explain great scientists' behavior in terms of brain anatomy.\\"  Then, why wasn't this book called \\"Strange Behaviors and Genius?\\"<br /><br />This brings up another question.  In chapter 14, the author defines a genius as having an intelligence quotient (IQ) \\"greater than 140.\\"  Some of the people he profiles and mentions lived when IQ tests did not exist.  How would the author (or anybody) know that they were true geniuses?<br /><br />(2) THE BOOK'S PREFACE.  The preface states the premise of the entire book as a question.  It asks, \\"Can mental illness convey great advantages to great scientists?\\"  Then amazingly, the author answers this question in the next sentence: \\"Most scientists do not exhibit bizarre behavior [that is, mental illness] and most people do not possess extraordinary creativity [that is, have great advantages].\\" Then, why was this book written?<br /><br />This brings up yet another question.  The book's subtitle states that scientists will only be discussed.  But the book's preface clearly states that \\"scientists, inventors, and philosophers\\" will also be discussed.  The book even discusses artists.  Then why doesn't the subtitle read \\"The Secret Lives of Eccentric People?\\"<br /><br />(3) OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD).  An entire chapter (chapter 10) is devoted to OCD.  As I was reading this chapter, I found that the author was equating and confusing OCD with obsession.  OCD is not the same as obsession.<br /><br />Also, this chapter is entitled \\"Obsession?\\"  WHY?  The author clearly states at the beginning of this chapter that it will \\"explore obsessive-compulsive disorder itself.\\"<br /><br />This confusing of OCD with obsession can be found throughout the entire book.  For example, in appendix B the author describes a scientific magazine article that was on OCD.  Yet he titles his description \\"The Anatomy of Obsession.\\"<br /><br />(4) THE BOOK'S ORGANIZATION.  The book is poorly organized because some chapters are included in the wrong place or a chapter is an appendix and vice versa.<br /><br />For example, appendix A entitled \\"Runners-Up List\\" briefly discusses eight more people that had strange behavior and were geniuses.  This information is relevant to the premise of the book.  Why is this information in an appendix at the back of the book?  Shouldn't this information have its own chapter near the book's beginning?<br /><br />(5) DRAWINGS.  The book contains many drawings.  However, many of the drawings don't need to be included in the book.  The inclusion of some of these drawings is even comical.<br /><br />For example, chapter 4 profiles a genius who was afraid of flies.  Amazingly, the author includes a drawing of flies to highlight this point!  Chapter 5 profiles a genius who made friends with rats.  Guess what the author draws to highlight this point?<br /><br />There are numerous other problems with this book.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a poorly referenced, poorly organized, and confusing book that has many problems.  This book is truly ONE FINE MESS.<br /><br />+++++light this point!  Chapter 5 profiles a genius who made friends with rats.  Guess what the author draws to highlight this point?<br /><br />There are numerous other problems with this book.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a poorly referenced, poorly organized, and confusing book that has many problems.

There is finally a practical book that shows you how to do that and this is the book!!<br /><br />This is not a cookbook of instructions but a book of practical guidelines to help you discover inborn abilities that NO one else can reveal to you.<br /><br />What are some of the features of this book that enable you to do this?  They are as follows:<br /><br />(1) TRUE STORIES.  The book is punctuated with true stories from those people who were initially knocked down by disruptive change.  These people were able to access their will to survive, and even gain strength from their adversity.<br /><br />(2) SELF-DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY INSERTS.  These short activities are for helping the reader get the most out of the book.  They occur at various places throughout the book.<br /><br />(3) DIAGRAMS AND CHARTS.  These also occur at various places throughout the book.  These are to help the reader understand important concepts.<br /><br />(4) THE AUTHOR'S WRITING STYLE.  All of what the author writes is easy to understand.  I could find no technical psychobabble anywhere in the book.<br /><br />(5) OTHER RESOURCES.  For those who want more information, other resources are listed at the back of the book.  An internet address is also given.<br /><br />I especially liked two chapters.  There first one is entitled \\"Thriving\\" which reveals how to grow in adversity instead of being a victim. The other one is entitled \\"The Roots of Resiliency: Your Inner 'Selfs'.\\"  This chapter examines and helps the reader understand his/her inner resiliency resources.<br /><br />In conclusion, being a disabled person I can validate what the author says in the final paragraph of his book: \\"It is...adversity [that] can lead to the discovery of strengths that you did not know you had...and a difficulty that almost breaks your spirit can be turned into one of the best things that ever happened to you.\\"<br /><br />+++++s that ever happened to you.\\"<br /><br />+++++	2003-10-21
US	45789111	R2P14998I94VH7	0743224574	87039745	A Beautiful Mind: The Life of Mathematical Genius and Nobel Laureate John Nash	Books	5	6	6	N	N	(Genius+Madness+Remission) X (Love+Support)= Nobel Prize	+++++<br /><br />This biography chronicles the life of John Forbes Nash Jr. (born: 1928).<br /><br />This book consists first of a prologue then five parts that make up the narrative.  As a brief synopsis, part one details Nash's mathematical genius.  This is, I feel, the most important part of the book.  Part two gives us insight into Nash's relationships.  Part three describes Nash's slipping into mental illness and his first hospitalization (around age thirty).  Part four gives readers an account of Nash's full-blown mental illness, his several hospitalizations, the love and patience of his ex-wife who helps him cope, and the support, loyalty, and patience of the mathematical community.  Lastly, part five tells us of his remission from mental illness (after thirty years) and his sharing of the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics (for his part in the pioneering analysis of equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games).<br /><br />This book has a number of good features:<br /><br />(1) THE PROLOGUE.  This is really a summary of the five parts discussed above.  It prepares the reader for the detailed chapters that follow.  I feel that this extremely well written prologue is a major feature of the book.<br /><br />(2) \\"MINI-BIOGRAPHIES.\\"  In the main narrative, the author does not only briefly mention important people (such as mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers) but in many instances gives a good description of who they are and what they accomplished.<br /><br />(3) VIVID DESCRIPTIONS OF PLACES.  For example, the author's description of Princeton in the late '40s/early '50s made me feel that I was really there.  Her description of what occurs behind the scenes before a Nobel Prize is given out is exquisite.<br /><br />(4) INFORMATION ABOUT SCHIZOPHRENIA.  As the biography progresses, important up-to-date information about this disease that can shatter lives is given to us for our understanding.<br /><br />(5) NASH'S MATHEMATICS. The author introduces the reader to important mathematical concepts. Some of these include game theory, Prisoner's Dilemma, cooperative versus non-cooperative games, symmetric versus asymmetric games, bargaining, algebraic manifolds, and quantum mechanics.  For those readers who want more information on these concepts, they can refer to the references included in the notes (footnotes at the back of the book) section and bibliography section.<br /><br />(6) PHOTOGRAPHS.  There are twenty-six black-and-white ones located at the end of part one.  These range from Nash's youth to when he won his shared Nobel Prize.<br /><br />(7) THE EPILOGUE.  This is very brief but informative.  It tells us about Nash's life after his Nobel Prize win.<br /><br />The main problem I had with this book is when the author attempts to explain the mathematical concepts that she introduces (as explained in (5) above).  I think the problem here is that her mathematical descriptions are all written and thus difficult to follow.  The use of diagrams and charts would have made these concepts more concrete.  For example, the concept of the Prisoner's Dilemma can be explained very clearly with a chart.  As well, a mathematical glossary would have been helpful.  It should be mentioned that understanding these mathematical concepts is NOT necessary to follow this biography.<br /><br />This problem brings up the movie (which I saw after reading the book first).  The movie has to condense a lifetime into a two-hour film.  Thus, much of the book's content is not in the film.  But the movie, being a visual medium, does illustrate the Prisoner's Dilemma well (near the beginning of the movie where Nash and his friends are attempting to pick up girls). And the movie is very creative in explaining Nash's mental problem.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want to learn about a man who \\"ranks among the greatest mathematicians of the post-war era\\" and learn how genius can be cloaked in madness, then read this interesting and moving biography!!<br /><br />+++++y!!<br /><br />+++++	2003-10-19
US	45789111	R2R8VJBCNASB54	0671739166	237012102	The Story of Philosophy: The Lives and Opinions of the World's Greatest Philosophers	Books	5	34	38	N	N	A MAGNUM OPUS	+++++<br /><br />The author, U.S. historian and Pulitzer Prize winner Will Durant (1885-1981) has written an exceptional book for any reader who wants to survey the history and development of philosophical ideas of the Western world.  However, this book is just not your typical survey!  It is also a stimulating introduction and enthusiastic invitation to philosophy of the Western world.<br /><br />This book concerns itself with fifteen influential Western world philosophers.  Each of them has their own chapter title.  These thinkers are as follows:<br /><br />(i) Spinoza, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Bergson*(ii) Croce* (iii) Plato, Aristotle, Kant, James^(iv) Spencer, Dewey^, Russell* and (v) Bacon, Voltaire, Satayana^.  (The three *asterisked* names are under the chapter title \\"Contemporary European Philosophers\\" and the three ^arrowed^ names are under the chapter title \\"Contemporary American Philosopers.\\")<br /><br />Other Western philosophers that are not as thoroughly discussed have their own sections (or sections in collaboration with others) within these chapters.  These include Socrates, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, and Comte.  As well, yet other Western philosopers are briefly mentioned in the main body of the book.<br /><br />Why do I call this book a Magnum Opus (that is, a Masterpiece)?  There are several reasons for this:<br /><br />(1) The INTRODUCTION.  Even though it is brief, it is written brilliantly and is a treat to read.  The reader, especially the first-time reader of Durant's works (such as myself) gets an idea at how skillful Durant is with words.  I even recognized some disguised Shakespeare!<br /><br />(2) The BOOK'S CONTENT.  This book is not just about philosophies but also about philosophers and the time in which they lived.<br /><br />The author combines his witty and dazzling narrative with excerpts from each philosopher's works so as to weave an interesting story.<br /><br />The author not only quotes the philosophers throughout but he directs the reader to the actual texts from which the quotations came.  As a result, when I finished reading the book, I had a desire to read more.<br /><br />(3) A USEFUL CHART (or Table).  It is entitled \\"Table of Philosophic Affiliations\\" and is located near the beginning of the third chapter.  It indicates the main lines of philosophical development in Europe and America by including the names and lifespans of almost fifty philosophers (including the ones detailed in the book) of the Western world.<br /><br />This chart divides the fifty philosophers into five groups where each member of the group practices a similar philosophy.  The reader can also tell at a glance the name of the previous philosopher or philosophers that influenced a future philosopher (and vice versa).  It also shows how a philosopher in one group can be influenced by a philosopher in another group.<br /><br />As an example, the groupings of the fifteen philosophers in paragraph three (above) of this review are based on this chart.<br /><br />(4) A HELPUL GLOSSARY.  Philosophy can introduce many new, unfamiliar words.  To aid in deciphering these words, there is a small glossary found at the back of the book.<br /><br />There are two irritations I have with my paperback edition.  It should be emphasized that these are NOT the author's fault and they do NOT interfere with the story flow of the book.<br /><br />First, on the front cover of the book there is an omission.  It is that the word \\"Western\\" should appear in the book's subtitle.  It should thus read \\"The Lives and Opinions of the WESTERN World's Greatest Philosophers.\\"<br /><br />Second, the important chart of (3) above is very easy to miss.  It should be indicated in the Table of Contents that it even exists.  As well, it would be easier to refer too if it was placed at the back of the book with the glossary.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want a brilliant and concise account of the lives and ideas of the greatest philosophers of the Western world that's written with wit for the nonspecialist, then get this profound book!!<br /><br />+++++rn world that's written with wit for the nonspecialist, then get this profound book!!<br /><br />+++++	2003-10-10

He was the only person to win two unshared Nobel Prizes.<br /><br /> This book has a number of good features:<br /><br /> (1) THE EDITORS' HONESTY. This slim book, as the editors state in the preface, does not do \\"complete justice to Linus Pauling's enormous life work\\" but is intended to give readers an \\"intriguing taste of his interests and accomplishments.\\"<br /><br /> (2) THE GOOD AND BAD. Be aware that this book not only has contributions from Pauling's friends, colleagues, and former students but also has contributions from his detractors and those who thought he was over-stepping his scientific boundaries.<br /><br /> (3) ARTICLES. This is not your typical narrative biography! It is divided into four parts and the first three parts is a series of articles. (I use the word \\"article\\" loosely to mean an essay, a chronology, diary excerpts, interview transcript, public speech transcript, letter, Nobel lecture transcript, book excerpt, journal excerpt, or television transcript.)<br /><br /> Articles are written in the first person by Pauling himself or in the third person by others. Before each article is a small italicized paragraph written by the editors. The purpose of this is to put each article into proper context with respect to time, place, and importance.<br /><br /> (4) THE BOOK'S STRUCTURE.  This book has four parts titled as follows:<br /><br />(i) \\"The Man.\\"  It presents the personal side and overall personality of Pauling.  It consists of nine articles, five of which were written by Pauling at various times in his life.  Note that Pauling had a wife named Ava Helen and four children.<br /><br />(ii) \\"The Science.\\" It details the scientific genius of Pauling. It consists of twelve articles, six written by Pauling. These science articles are not difficult to follow.  Pauling won the 1954 Nobel Prize in chemistry.  Specifically he won it \\"for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances.\\"<br /><br />(iii) \\"The Peace Work.\\" It discusses Pauling's anti-nuclear peace work. It consists of six articles, all of them written by Pauling.  Pauling won the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize \\"for his efforts to end open-air testing of nuclear weapons.\\"<br /><br />(iv) \\"Facets.\\"  It gives us various brief snippets of Pauling in the form of historical reminiscences or short anecdotes not only written by Pauling but by others (such as family members, friends, and colleagues).  There are over forty of these that were written or said during his lifetime or after his death.<br /><br /> (5) PICTURES. Over eighty are peppered throughout the book. When I say pictures, I mean black-and-white photographs; sketches; and reproduced, readable notes, manuscripts, letters, and textbook covers. There's even a reproduction of the Paulings' famous and controversial nuclear weapon's petition!<br /><br /> (6) MARGINALIA. In the margins of the book, there are short anecdotes (shorter than those mentioned in the \\"Facets\\" section above). These are based on taped interviews with colleagues and contemporaries. There are over thirty of these scattered throughout the book.<br /><br /> (7) BIBLIOGRAPHY. Finally there is a useful selected bibliography. It consists of a significant list of articles written by Pauling and important books written by him.  (My favorite book written by him is entitled \\"How to Live Longer and Feel Better\\" (1986).)  There is also a list of books and articles written about Pauling.<br /><br /> One of my favorite articles was in the science part. This article details the race to find the structure of DNA. According to Pauling, Dr. Rosalind Franklin's scientific work and X-ray photographs (which he never had access too) were the key that unlocked DNA's double helix structure.<br /><br /> In conclusion, if you want a multi-dimensional portrait of a two-time Nobel Prize winner who was the recipient of numerous awards and medals and, as well, for those who want a unique reading experience where you can form your OWN picture of this brilliant man, then peruse this fascinating book.<br /><br />+++++ulti-dimensional portrait of a two-time Nobel Prize winner who was the recipient of numerous awards and medals and, as well, for those who want a unique reading experience where you can form your OWN picture of this brilliant man, then peruse this fascinating book.<br /><br />+++++	2003-10-06

It is NOT saying that there are no extrasolar Earth-SIZE planets but only that extrasolar Earth-LIKE planets (that is, other planets that support carbon-based and DNA-based life as we know it) probably do not exist.<br /><br />In other words, this book (and the authors state this) is using PROVEN forms of life known to exist which is the carbon-based and DNA-based life found on one planet known to have life -- Earth.<br /><br />Also, this book is NOT saying that extrasolar planets that support life as we DO NOT know it (non-carbon based and non-DNA based life) do not exist.  It's just that there is no hard evidence (but theoretically it's possible) for such life.<br /><br />This book has a number of good features:<br /><br />(1) REFERENCES. Over 25 pages that mainly consist of recent journal articles written by respected scientists.<br /><br />(2) SUMMARY INTRODUCTIONS.  There are two, 2-page summary introductions.  They are entitled \\"Dead Zones of the Universe\\" (nine zones where life as we know it is thought not to exist) and \\"Rare Earth Factors\\" (eighteen factors that may be unique to Earth and that thus collectively permit life as we know it).  These summary introductions provide a roadmap for the first ten (of thirteen) chapters of this book.<br /><br />(3) THE FIRST TEN CHAPTERS.  These chapters are very detailed and build-up (using both historical theories and data as well as recent new theories and data) the summary information mentioned in (2) above.<br /><br />(4) THE FINAL THREE CHAPTERS.  These chapters are particularly interesting.  Here we get more aquainted with Ward & Brownlee's Rare Earth Hypothesis (microbial life is common in the universe, but complex, multicellular life, such as human life, is rare) and introduced to the Rare Earth Equation.  This hypothesis and equation are formulated from the information found in the first ten chapters mentioned in (3) above.<br /><br />Despite these good features, there is one obvious distraction with this book -- it contains some factual errors.  Here are just four examples: (1) some of the terms of the famous Drake Equation (developed by the SETI Institute's Dr. Frank Drake in 1961) are not correctly defined (2) the number of stars in our Galaxy is on average 200 billion (not million) (3) Mercury and Venus do not always present the same face to the sun (4) and the human genome has less than 100 thousand (not millions of) genes.<br /><br />Normally, I would not nitpick like this but Ward & Brownlee are scientists and I feel that they should not have gotten these rather elementary facts wrong.  However, it should be noted that these distractions do not undermine the main premise of the book.<br /><br />Since this book is dedicated to the late Dr. Carl Sagan (as well as another person), I feel I should explain Sagan's results (presented in his best-seller \\"Cosmos\\") based on using the Drake equation that indicates another reason we may be alone, at least, in the Galaxy.  Sagan calculates that \\"the number of [advanced technical] civilizations [known as \\"N\\"] in the Galaxy [could be] in the millions\\" (thus satisfying those who state the simple argument that since there's billions of stars in the Galaxy, there must be many advanced civilizations).<br />BUT Sagan also says that \\"The number N might be as small as 1 [just us].\\"  Why does he say this?  He explains: \\"If civilizations tend to destroy themselves soon after reaching a technological phase there might be no one for us to talk with but ourselves...Civilizations would take billions of years of tortuous evolution to arise [as Ward & Brownlee detail exquisitely], and then snuff themselves out in an instant [or some cosmic event snuffs them out as Ward & Brownlee, again, explain exquisitely].\\"<br /><br />Finally, for an opposite opinion of what Ward & Brownlee's book present, I recommend Frank Drake's \\"Is Anyone Out There?: The Scientific Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence\\" (paperback, 1994) and/or visting the SETI internet site.<br /><br />In conclusion, despite some factual distractions, this book has a number of good features that collectively give a challenging second opinion regarding life in the universe.  If you like challenges, then I strongly recommend that you read this book!!<br /><br />**** 1/2<br /><br />+++++, I recommend Frank Drake's \\"Is Anyone Out There?: The Scientific Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence\\" (paperback, 1994) and/or visting the SETI internet site.<br /><br />In conclusion, despite some factual distractions, this book has a number of good features that collectively give a challenging second opinion regarding life in the universe.

US	45789111	R3B0WGYETIEP26	0471395366	654603947	Carl Sagan: A Life	Books	4	5	7	N	N	True Story about a Scientist and the Man Behind the Science	+++++<br /><br />The author, Keay Davidson, has written an engaging book about an exceptional man.<br /><br />This book has a number of good features:<br /><br />(1)  Davidson's portrayal of Dr. Carl Sagan.<br /><br />He does not only give a \\"superstar scientist\\" media image view of Sagan but also gives us the personal and sometimes unlikeable side of him. The author does this in such a way that the reader gets a balanced view of Sagan.  Davidson, as evidenced from the acknowledgements and notes section of the book, does this by drawing on a great wealth of interviews with Sagan's family members, friends, teachers & colleagues (the majority of which were top scientists or Nobel Prize winners), admirers, and detractors, as well as from a large archive of unpublished writings and personal papers.<br /><br />(2) The science presented by Davidson.<br /><br />Sagan was involved in many areas of science and Davidson (a science writer) does an excellent job of explaining these areas in non-technical terms.<br /><br />(3) The author's psychohistorical analysis of Sagan.<br /><br />Events that happened to Sagan are analysed with respect to either past or future occurrences in Sagan's life.  By doing this, Davidson gives his narrative an interesting and enjoyable flow.<br /><br />(4) The thirty black-and-white photographs.<br /><br />These photos, located in the middle of the book, give a kind of mini-chronology of Sagan's life.<br /><br />(5) Over 100 pages of footnotes as notes.<br /><br />These alone make interesting reading and contain revealing information that did not make it into the over 400-page narrative.<br /><br />(6) The last chapter of the book.<br /><br />In this chapter, Sagan succumbs to his medical condition.  This chapter is done with exquisite taste and sensitivity.  As well, we are given a glimpse of how others in Sagan's life are moving on with their life after his death.<br /><br />My only complaint with this book is Davidson's very harsh treatment of Sagan's Pulitzer Prize-winning book \\"The Dragons of Eden.\\"  I think the author forgot that this book is subtitled \\"Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence,\\" the key word  being \\"Speculations.\\"<br /><br />Finally, I feel that there is an important omission in the book.  The author mentions very briefly Dr. Stephen Hawking.  However, Davidson fails to mention that Sagan, after his enormous success with his books \\"Cosmos\\" and \\"Contact,\\" wrote an eloquent introduction to Hawking's first major book.  In effect, Sagan used his fame to launch Hawking's successful literary career.  I think this speaks volumes for Sagan's character.<br /><br />In summary, Davidson has written a facinating biography about an extraordinary man who had a lifelong love affair with science.  This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to know more about the life of Dr. Carl Edward Sagan (1934 to 1996).<br /><br />+++++agan's Pulitzer Prize-winning book \\"The Dragons of Eden.\\"  I think the author forgot that this book is subtitled \\"Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence,\\" the key word  being \\"Speculations.\\"<br /><br />Finally, I feel that there is an important omission in the book.
