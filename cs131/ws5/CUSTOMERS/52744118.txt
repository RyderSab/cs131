This is far from a personal attack on Moore; it is a very fair and factual book that logically counters the many factual distortions in Moore's films and his public statements.<br /><br /> While all of Moore's films are factually and logically atrocious, some of his own statements and actions in public are worse. Despite posing as self-appointed defender of lower class Americans (as if they need a representative), Moore regularly insults Americans at home and abroad. He owns property in Manhattan and Michigan worth roughly 4 million dollars, and boasts that he is &quot;filthy rich.&quot; He has compared the murderous militants in Iraq to the Minutemen of the American Revolution. He continually refers to the President as a &quot;liar&quot; although in a recent interview with Bill O'Reilly, he was clearly incapable of differentiating between a lie and an innocent statement that in hindsight is not 100% correct. Clark and Hardy also dissect many of Moore statements and actions showing that Moore is indeed a classic narcissist.<br /><br /> Clark and Hardy's book show that Michael Moore's contributions to political discourse over the past few years have hinged mainly on gross distortions, conspiracy theories, infantile attacks and insults, and, of course, bold lies. He remains an opportunistic individual who will use anyone for his own agenda and then just as easily discard them like trash. The greatest casualty in Moore's destructive path is the truth. Moore's work ultimately proclaims that the truth, if it exists for him at all, means nothing. Besides his own fame and fortune, Moore only cares about a worn and discredited socialist ideology that is poisoning America.	2004-07-30

That the Fair itself was built under severe time contraints and beaurocratic tangling was a near miracle. A cast of historical figures like Susan B. Anthony, Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, and nobility from around the world, attended. (A major exception was writer Mark Twain, who fell ill and ultimately did not attend the Fair.)<br />Larson sprinkles bits of info on H.H. Holmes, a manipulative and criminally minded man who ultimately murders between 27 to 200 people, some of them while operating a hotel near the World's Fair. Larson may have had difficulty either finding enough information on Holmes, and Larson may even have been disinterested in some of the more macabre details of his crimes. It is only until the last 50 pages of the book that Larson goes into serious detail about Holmes's final murders and his own fate.<br />Larson's major achievement here is bringing a major event of American history to light. To be sure, he could have balanced the book with a bit more info on &quot;The Devil&quot; and less on &quot;The White City,&quot; but that may just be a subjective assessment.<br />Informative, enjoyable, and highly recommended.	2004-04-08

William McGowan's &quot;Coloring the News&quot; places the mainstream media under a microscope analyzing the claims that &quot;diversity&quot; in the newsroom will improve news coverage and inform the public to a greater degree. McGowan demonstrates that not only has news not improved, but reporters have deliberately avoided covering uncomfortable and inconvenient aspects of many stories for fear of &quot;stereotyping&quot; or &quot;offending.&quot; The result is a consistently sanitized and skewed version of events. McGowan makes clear &quot;diversity&quot; of viewpoint is significantly more important in a newsroom that skin color or gender, yet newsrooms, in employing more minorities and systematically excluding white males, and solidified the liberal ideological grip on news coverage. Ironically, in the quest for &quot;diversity&quot; there has been much less presentation of different viewpoints, especially conservative or Christian views. The unintended effect of all this has been a mass fleeing from the networks to other sources of news such as radio and the internet which atleast give some validity to the conservative viewpoint.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-12-17

Not surprisingly each of these often do not pretend to have a very liberal agenda all the while telling the public with a straight face that their tremedous biases do not influence their commentary and daily news decisions.<br />Some of Goldberg's topics include:<br />- A lengthy discussion about coverage of various kidnappings that mysteriously were all of white girls. When the kidnapping of a black girl was finally covered, what the media failed to report reveals much about their liberal agenda.<br />- Hillary Clinton, the patroness of the liberal media. Whether it is Barbara Walters, Leslie Stahl, or Eleanor Clift, no one dares to ask any difficult questions of the former First lady, and much like the rest of the media, they never fail to gush adoringly over Clinton regardless of her very flawed and potentially criminal past.<br />- The shameful treatment of Paula Jones who, when accusing the former President of sexual harassment, was maligned as \\"trash.\\" Juanita Broaddrick, too, was ignored or mistreated because of her accusations of rape against Bill Clinton during his Arkansas days.<br />- The near \\"lynching\\" of Justice Clarence Thomas. Not surprisingly, Anita Hill's story and details were not to be questioned while Thomas's reputation was ruined.<br />- Feminists iron grip on the media, and how much they dictate the details and discussion about gender and children's issues.<br />- The gay and lesbian lobby's major influence on the media's handling of the Catholic Church's sexual abuse scandal.<br />Included here are very thoughtful and informative interviews that Goldberg conducted with Bob Costas and Tim Russert, and a \\"12 step program\\" for finally correcting rampant liberal bias in the news. While Goldberg's suggestions are somewhat interesting, one wonders if ANYONE at ABC, NBC, or CBS would even consider anything Goldberg would have to say. (For the liberal media, there is no problem at all!)<br />One annoying flaw in \\"Arrogance\\" is Goldberg's tone. He could not decide whether to be informal or formal. At times, he sounded as if he is speaking to old friends at a bar.

Shrady's \\"Tilt\\" is a well written account about Pisa's war torn history and the famous Tower that would take hundreds of years to complete amidst turbulent times.<br />Shrady does a good job dispelling the myths surrounding the Leaning Tower, the greatest being that the Tower was some great architectural error. No error at Pisa, just soggy ground! Also. Galileo has always been associated with the Tower of Pisa, but Shrady discusses how Galileo probably never climbed it.<br />Unfortunately, Shrady tends to focus on the city of Pisa for the bulk of the book. Certainly, the history of the city is important and it does relate to the Tower, but one tends to assume that the book would discuss Leaning Tower more, and this is not the case. The ending is somewhat abrupt. I was hoping for detailed discussion on the renovation of 1999, and it seems as if Shrady could have expanded on it.<br />(The book's cover is rather brilliant: The top and bottom are cut on angles so that when placed upright, it appears to \\"tilt\\"!

Sadly, there is little else to compliment.<br />For a writer who recently won the Pulitzer Prize, it is surprising that Lahiri fails on the most basic level of any story: there is no real conflict in \\"The Namesake.\\" The only attempt at conflict is the main character's occasional problems with his first name, \\"Gogol.\\" (Gogol's father decides to name his son after the Russian author, Nikolai Gogol.) This is hardly enough of a conflict to carry a 300 page novel. Besides his first name, Gogol's only experiences with adversity are the death of his father, which Lahiri fails to explore with any detail, and the break up of a relationship. (Poor Gogol finds himself a new girlfriend a chapter later.)<br />While Lahiri tends to know her characters well, she does very little with Gogol's only sister, Sonia. We barely know her.  Gogol's father dies suddenly mid-way through the novel, but Lahiri doesn't use this life altering event to add any significance to the novel.<br />The reader will find very little story here. As a writer, Jhumpa Lahiri is simply capable of much more.	2003-10-06

Ingraham tells us their &quot;native habitats&quot; are in politics, media, universities, arts and entertainment, business, and international organizations. Theirs is an agenda that consistenly involves a seething anti-Americanism, suspicion and fear whenever the United States seeks to defend its citizens or interests, and demands for America to blindly follow international plans for a one world government.<br />The first half of &quot;Shut Up and Sing&quot; will be a bit familiar to those following the elitist obstructionism during the Iraqi invasion. The second half is actually stronger in tone and facts especially when Ingraham discusses the horrible effects illegal immigration has on the US, the corporate corruption of Enron et al, the arrogance of university elitists, and the UN's dream of subverting the United States.<br />Laura Ingraham successfully and truthfully exposes the elitist agenda for what it is. Those who would criticize &quot;Shut Up and Sing&quot; for its content will sadly do so because the myriad of facts she provides are inconvenient and bothersome. Thankfully, for Ingraham and her fans, truth is more important than ideology.	2003-09-22

It would be unfair to claim that Clinton did nothing against terrorism. Miniter tells us that under Clinton's watch, many terrorists were apprehended and terrorist cells destroyed. Yet Clinton's major error came in the form of years and years of hesitation, unsure whether evidence against bin Laden and his network of terrorists was ever enough, and if it was, should the military be engaged?<br />Once it was clear that al Queda was more than a band of criminals, a conclusion that was reached well into Clinton's second term, several plans against bin Laden and company failed due to struggles among the CIA, FBI and other agencies. Under Clinton's reign embassies were bombed, the USS Cole nearly sunk, and dozens of Americans would die. Ultimately the failures among several American agencies and Clinton's constant vacillations permitted bin Laden's plans for a second wave of horrible attacks culminating on September 11, 2001.	2003-09-12

While on a mission to learn why Door's family was murdered, Richard still longs for home, for his job, and his fiancee.<br />Gaiman's writing is elegant, occasionally humorous, and his characters are well developed (with exception of a few minor characters that could have been excluded entirely) especially Richard, Door and the assasins Vandemar and Croup.

She reminds us that introverts and extroverts are &quot;wired&quot; differently and each termperament has advantages and disadvantages of their own. Extroverts, however, are more common and tend to be much more celebrated. Introverts, despite offering a vast array of talents, are often inaccurately seen as shy, detached misfits who can't or are not willing to socialize. Rather, they tend to be more sensitive to stimuli, are more energtic when alone, and need more rest to recharge from social situations.<br />The main problem with &quot;The Introvert Advantage,&quot; large font and all, is that it comprises 313 pages. A normal font and some editing could have cut it down atleast 50 pages or more. Also, while Laney's suggestions to coping with socializing are helpful, the topic seemed to go on and on. Again, editing would have helped.	2003-08-04

Sadly, it is not only memories that Samson loses. Krauss explores the vast web of confusion and alienation Samson experiences with his wife, a woman whom he no longer knows or understands. A professor at Columbia, Samson has no recollection of his work there or his connection to the university. With seemingly little to lose, Samson goes to the middle of a Nevada desert to conduct vague, futurist brain research except Samson himself is the object of the research. After an extanglement with the doctor-researcher, Krauss shifts gears sending Samson to soul searching travels, looking for his lost uncle and eventually his mother. The novel does unravel some toward the end, and it is clear that Krauss had difficulty with the ending. In all fairness, this is a first novel, and one that raises some important questions about identity, how much of our sanity relates to other people, and the importance of family. In all, Krauss writes a strong novel which provokes much reflection. Recommended.	2003-07-31

We learn that Newton is a tempermental man, often isolated and cared little for social life. He laid down some of the most important natural laws we have and accumulated a vast sum of wealth and various honors for his efforts.<br />The only flaw here is Gleick's prose. It often does not flow very well and the author tends to jump from one idea to the next with few connections in between. Nonetheless, thanks to Gleick, the reader has a better view of Sir Isaac Newton and that makes this book a worthy read.	2003-07-27

In &quot;Cosmopolis,&quot; DeLillo's language is more controlled and self-assured than most of his novels. There is a stream of consciousness here that his other novels do not have. As usual, DeLillo's descriptions are often excellent (he even composes a few rap lyrics midway in the book). But at other times, he falls into over-analyzing objects, ideas, people, that have no real significance and ultimately test the reader's patience. In doing this, DeLillo &quot;waters down&quot; an excellent novel. Some editing here and there would have helped.<br />Usually, DeLillo's characters are cardboard props used as mouth pieces for his own ideas. In &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; DeLillo attempts to make them more vivid, especially in the main character of Eric Packer and his stalker. Packer's other acquaintances, even his wife, however, are not developed well and are rather forgettable. Packer's journey through New York is rather interesting. Along the way, he learns the President is in town; a famous rapper's funeral is proceeding through the streets; and he is being stalked.<br />The last 60+ pages of &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; are worth the price of the book and provide the reader with a vivid and impressive climax.<br />Recommended.	2003-07-14

In &quot;Slander,&quot; Coulter announces what we've always suspected: the media tilts left, sometimes far left. In &quot;Treason,&quot; Coulter once again spreads the truth like wildfire, this time defending Joe McCarthy.<br />&quot;Treason&quot; is almost separated into two parts. In part One Coulter deals with McCarthy and the attacks that *he* endured for investigating the many Soviet spies who had already infiltrated major positions in US government. During McCarthy's day, it was McCarthy himself who, despite his popularity with the public, was eventually attacked unfairly, often smeared and disgraced. At best, he was quite effective at focusing attention on America's enemies. Later in the book, Coulter deals with the predictable liberal opposition to the invasion in Iraq, the continuing controversy over North Korea's nuclear weapons, and the countless celebrities with a knack for uttering the most uninformed statements one should ever hear.<br />Coulter's theme is resounding clear and rather repetitive: Liberals without fail side against American interests irrespective of the facts. Why this is so is not clearly explained, but one might guess that those who would attack America and fail to defend her so consistently take their country and freedom for granted, magnifying America's faults and failures, rather than simply acknowledging that America remains the most free country on earth.<br />Coulter ends with a scalding conclusion which is impressive and truthful to say the least, but may be interpreted by some to be overly aggressive. Still, it would not be Coulter writing without her throwing rhetorical bombs at the opposition.<br />Recommended.	2003-07-02

For loners, solitude is simply a different way of living life, one which keeps sane those of us who find socializing exhausting.<br />Rufus challenges the media's automatic assumption that all serial killers are &quot;loners&quot; (demonstrably false) or that solitary children are bound to get into serious trouble (many of histories greatest geniuses and artists have been solitary souls). Rufus can write well and I applaud her for devoting much time to proudly thinking about solitude and defending those who rather be left alone.	2003-06-16

Bjorn Lomborg's critics would do well to begin reading his book. His critics sadly will look to his title and simply assume that because he is a professor of *statistics* that he could never make an intelligent argument on the environment. Yet, Lomborg's analysis is based on statistical evidence taken around from the world and hundreds of different sources. One suspects that even if Lomborg was the most honored environmental scientist on earth, his critics would still disparage him for no other reason than his conclusions are actually positive and not comprised of Doomsday scenarios.<br />Even if we were to assume that Lomborg's optimism is naïve, that some of his conclusions are incorrect, or his interpretation of statistics proves wrong, his often repeated point is the same: the environment certainly needs to be cared for, and we still have much work to do, but nonetheless the state of our air, water, food production, life expectancy, income, etc. have given us some reason to be proud.  Surely this should be cause for SOME celebration! Lomborg should be praised and admired at minimum for not running with the herd and instead looking at facts and reality to come to his conclusions. In this way, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; is an excellent book,  and definitely worth a read (or two). If environmentalists would only take his lead and present the status of the environment fully and completely, they would gain much more credibility.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-06-07

On her way, she meets a host of strange characters, some of whom are very interesting, and others which are simply too bizarre to be taken seriously.<br />The only real flaw with Abarat is that the stakes are not very high. Yes, Candy is sought after by the evil Lord Carrion, but neither character is developed enough for us to care about them too much. Granted, this is the first book in a series and Barker apparently did not want to show us everything in Book 1, but I did not feel the tension of the Harry Potter books here.<br />Barker's imagination is incredibly fertile and the paintings he includes in this work are worth the price of the book alone. The painting of the Abarat itself is marvelous! Overall, Abarat is a good book and recommended.	2003-05-22

One reading a Chrichton novel expects a consistent dose of science, yet despite the interesting theme of this novel, the first 130 pages or so of the novel is devoted entirely to the main character's family problems. I am amazed that I continued reading about such boring and ultimately inconsequential situations.<br />Although Crichton's characters in &quot;Prey&quot; are more &quot;real&quot; and human than Chrichton's characters usually are, the dialogue is ridiculous. The main characters children speak to each other (and their parents) like brats. The adults rarely sound much better.<br />The novel has many positive points and the middle portions of the novel are interesting and the pages turn quickly. The ending is poorly written and did not satisfy me. Although Chrichton attempts to tie the ending to the beginning, this technique, while usually effective, did not work well here.<br />Without a doubt, Crichton is a brilliant mind and a great writer, but &quot;Prey&quot; needed a team of editors.

Having resisted the mania surrounding Harry Potter, I was certain I would not join the legions of Potter fans, but being a lover of books, I received all of the Potter books as a gift.

When he is invited at Hogwart's School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, he realizes that he is already a minor celebrity at the school. From there, Harry, and his friends Ron and Hermione learn magic and become part of a quest for the Sorcerer's Stone, a Stone that an evil magician desperately wants.<br />That this first of Rowling's books is aimed at children should not prevent readers of any age to enjoy Harry Potter and his adventures. Rowling proves to have a tremendous imagination, conjuring a fantasy world that is not only fascinating, but believeable and entertaining. Highly recommended!	2003-04-01

Line after line, his prose flows smoothly and seamlessly. He creates an eerie and exciting atmosphere which is itself almost a substitute for a general lack of plot. It is through innocent and adverturous characters and a strong use of language that Bradbury provides the reader with more of a masterful literary experience than entertainment.<br />Despite Bradbury's charming, innocent characters and poetic prose, there is little at stake here and the novel is at times a connection of sketches and short stories. Although meaningful, the novel's ending is not very dramatic and ends suddenly.	2002-11-17

Page after page, the photographs compiled by Michael Reagan are a microscopic tour of the universe within us all. Beautifully colored photos of almost every part of the human body are here: synapses, DNA, the human embryo during early cell division, cancer cells, and AIDS. There is also a small section of substances used during religious ceremonies of each major religion.<br />Certainly this book may never convince everyone of God's amazing work or the existence of God at all. But the book leads the reader to acknowledge that beneath the simplest substance, the most mundane aspect of ourselves, is a huge, intricate and orderly universe which, although invisible to the naked eye, exists just as surely as we do.

In this slim yet strong new book, &quot;Letters to a Young Conservative,&quot; Dinesh D'Souza presents a discussion aimed to those entering the liberal bastion of academia. The reader benefits from the author's political experience from his days as founder of the Dartmouth Review, to his work as domestic policy analyst under Ronald Reagan.<br />D'Souza covers a wide array of topics that a student will likely hear on campus from the true nature of political correctness to the causes it champions such as affirmative action, abortion, gun control, anti-globalization, etc. D'Souza can be amusing and irreverant in his descriptions and stories, but is always successful in exposing the liberal agenda truthfully and accurately.<br />Although D'Souza could have expanded his discussion on certain areas, &quot;Letters to a Young Conservative&quot; is a great start for anyone who seeks a broader understanding of politics and the rationale behind various political issues.	2002-10-15

Economics can be a rather intimidating area of study, but this is partly because many of us have not been educated to look too far beyond immediate effects of our actions. Hazlitt repeatedly illustrates, in clear and understandable language, why economic agendas which focus on beneficiaries only soon cause more harm than good. Here Hazlitt discusses an array of topics from tariffs, minimum wage, &quot;full employment,&quot; the effects of machinery on employment, government price fixing, rent control, and others.<br />&quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; has been revised over many years and was originally written over 50 years ago, but amazingly, the very topics he discusses can be found regularly on the nightly news, in newspapers, or discussed among politicians. Hazlitt believes that although economists are largly in agreement with what the government and unions should and should not do, he feels that we've learned very little. Fortunately, Hazlitt has left us a concise book that explains how we can really benefit society in a sound economic way. Recommended!	2002-10-13

Asimov's &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; was fortunately the first work I ever read from this master writer. My expectations were more than fulfilled.<br />The main character is Hari Seldon who possesses a rudimentary mathematical framework for predicting future events. His problem is living in a universe where there are 25 million planets  and trying to take the massive amount of information from each to make a reliable model from which to predict the future. Seldon is aided by Hummin who helps transport him across the planet and Dors, a historian, who try to keep Seldon and his ideas from being seized. Seldon gradually refines his approach to predicting the future, leading Seldon (and the reader) to a great many surprises about the many whom he trusted along the way.<br />Asimov creates a complex plot which could have easily unraveled, but he ties all loose ends together in this skillful and brilliant novel. A must read for anyone interested in science fiction!	2002-10-12

Refreshingly opposed to ubiquitous political correctness, Hanson discusses various topics related to the 9-11 massacre: the Taliban and bin Laden; Hollywood and academia's baseless anti-Americanism; discussions on the Civil War's General Sherman and the generals of ancient Greece. At times, Hanson's tone is a bit too opinionated, and he packs his essays with historical events and characters with which the layman may not necessary be familiar. Nonetheless, Hanson tackles a wide array of topics leaving the reader with a much better view of 9-11 and the necessity of current military action.	2002-09-14

Sadly, it is not only memories that Samson loses. Krauss explores the vast web of confusion and alienation Samson experiences with his wife, a woman whom he no longer knows or understands. A professor at Columbia, Samson has no recollection of his work there or his connection to the university. With seemingly little to lose, Samson goes to the middle of a Nevada desert to conduct vague, futurist brain research except Samson himself is the object of the research. After an extanglement with the doctor-researcher, Krauss shifts gears sending Samson to soul searching travels, looking for his lost uncle and eventually his mother. The novel does unravel some toward the end, and it is clear that Krauss had difficulty with the ending. In all fairness, this is a first novel, and one that raises some important questions about identity, how much of our sanity relates to other people, and the importance of family. In all, Krauss writes a strong novel which provokes much reflection. Recommended.	2002-08-23

She outlines the wide array of lies, insults, labels and venom that have been directed at conservatives and their leaders. Many of Coulter's topics will sound very familiar: the media's protection of Al Gore before, during, and after the 2000 campaign vs. the relentless (and baseless) concerns about Bush's intelligence; Reagan's accomplishments vs. the media's concern with, you guessed it, his intelligence; how conservative books, at least to the media, are always \\"surprise\\" best sellers, while liberal themed books tend to bomb at the cash register, etc.<br />The main fault with this book is that Coulter spends too much time on the \\"religious right\\" and not enough time on the venom directed to Pro-Lifers. In all fairness, the religious right (a meaningless label really, and used pejoritively) is regularly maligned and labeled for their values and religion, but one wonders if such a lengthy discussion was necessary. Coulter concludes with some discussion on abortion, but not nearly enough to do the topic justice. Surely she is aware of the media's insistence to use the negative label \\"anti-abortion\\" rather than \\"pro-life\\" and she must know that Pro-Life incidents of clinic vandalism and bombings are overblown in proportion while violence by Pro-Choicers against Lifers (praying rosaries, no less) is completely ignored. Coulter may have been in a rush to publish this one, but nonetheless, it's a necessary discussion on the visicous misrepresentations and arrogance within the media in attacking anything outside the liberal ideology. And they call conservatives \\"intolerant\\"?	2002-07-13

Despite such a major loss of life on its own soil, some were railing against U.S. foreign policy, and the treatment of Muslims even while the search for bodies was beginning. Bennett challenges the pacifists, unable to distinguish wars of agression and wars of defense, the ridiculous claims that the War on Terrorism is somehow a &quot;racist,&quot; and the need for educators and society as a whole to embrace patriotism as a virtue, not something of which to be ashamed. Bennett may have his critics, and &quot;Why We Fight&quot; is not without its faults, but it is refreshing to hear a voice discussing morals and righteous anger in the midst of the 1960s soft relativism that still pollutes the air. Very recommended.	2002-07-04

We see Galileo as the victim of the Church's hold on the dissemination of science, and his daughter, a cloistered nun who is powerless to help him. Yet, it is the letters they share that help Galileo through his inquisition and imprisonment. Although somewhat lengthy in certain parts, Sobel ultimately gives the reader a much broader sense of the world that Galileo -- and his daughter -- lived in.	2002-06-24

Pipes discusses in detail the roots of Communism, it's eventual collapse, and why it still survives in some parts of the world while its leaders are obvilious to its  defects. Although Pipes could have written a much longer book, this is an excellent beginning for anyone with interest in politics and specifically the stubborn existence of Socialist thought.	2002-05-03

It is, in short, a socialist Utopia whereby all people and things are engineered to be equal. Huxley's portrait is terrifying in that it is not all that far-fetched. Entire institutions are based on such concepts, and Huxley portrays the characters here as fully in-tune and accepting to this reality. The lone exeption is, ironically, a character Huxley names &quot;the Savage,&quot; a Native American who, despite a lack of  formal education, raises serious questions about the Brave New World, leading to tragic consequences.<br />&quot;Brave New World&quot; is a bit disturbing at times, but forces the reader to think and see the world differently. It is indeed a book that changes one's view of government and people, and appears to remind us that it is government that serves people and not the other way around.	2002-03-27

For years conservatives have known that news has a mass left-wing agenda behind it. Goldberg finally seems to confirm what people have known all along. He discusses the stories that make the news and those that don't and why. What is surprising is not that the media takes sides regularly, but they literally manufacture headlines and stories with very little support except maybe a conventiently misinterpreted statistic here and there. While the book at times places too much emphasis on Goldberg's own experiences, it does serve to show that the media elite hated Goldberg for his Wall Street Journal articles when he first let the &quot;secret&quot; out about liberal bias, and continues to hate him now for publication of this book. &quot;Bias&quot; is a very readable and important statement about the power that mainstream media wields at the public's expense.	2002-01-14

Encountering goblins, spiders, and wolves, Bilbo is savior to his dwarf friends. After encountering the groups' nemesis Smaug, he feels he is a better person having left the comforts of his hobbit hole.

He initially succeeds, but the scientific background for which Crichton is so famous comprises only a quarter of the book. The rest of Timeline involves the main characters stuck in 14th century France and constantly avoiding caputure and death. Little else happens. Indeed every time traveling character in the novel should have been killed, injured, tortured or imprisoned half way into the book. Crichton of course finds a way to get them out of trouble regardless of the circumstances. While this group is back in time, another group of underdeveloped characters don't seem too alarmed that their friends are lost 600 years in time. They attempt to get back their friends home, but the head of the time travel operation, a cruel and selfish corporate head, doesn't invest much in getting them back despite the risk to their lives. One suspects that someone THAT bad would get theirs in the end, but Crichton doesn't end Timeline as most readers might expect, and it rings hollow.<br />Crichton can tell a story well, and he does a fine job keeping a reader at the edge of his seat. While he may have set out to write a book on medieval France, one expects some science spread throughout the book, and in this regard, he just doesn't deliver as well as he is capable.	2001-10-22

Yet this is less a discussion on the environment of today's campuses, and more on how things got to be this way. Ellis specifically focuses on literary criticism, and modern Marxist attempts to reduce everything to a political/power argument whether the author intended such an interpretation or not. Meanwhile, examination of &quot;art for art's sake&quot; and of the questions that such literature was written to reveal takes a back seat. Whole careers seem to be built on this very skewed view of literature, and Ellis is even more worried that the prevailing PC dogmas of oppression, sexism, racism, etc. will fade only to be replaced by yet another intellectual fad. Sometimes Ellis's writing is a bit dense, but if the reader sticks with Ellis's arguments, he or she will find &quot;Literature Lost&quot; to be an interesting and illuminating work.	2001-07-30

This I can agree with, but the idea that &quot;dark entities&quot; of the world, the trouble-makers, have no spirit guides of  their own is hard to understand. There are a few more confusing moments  here...<br />Francine mentions that there are many miscarriages becuase the  soul within the baby has figured out that her/his parent has taken a wrong  turn making it more difficult for the soul to fulfill its' life theme.  Sylvia then asks if abortion is &quot;okay.&quot; Francine states rather  clearly that a soul would never enter a baby who would eventually get  aborted. Sylvia isn't fooling this reader. Sylvia seems to imply that  abortion should carry no regrets since, after all, a soul would never enter  such a baby, right?<br />While the book presents some valid, well explained  points, the questions Sylvia presents are so disconnected from the previous  question, you wonder if she took years to put this book together. And her  spirit guide, Francine, sounds a bit arrogant on occasion. She refers to  human beliefs as &quot;so ridiculous.&quot; Maybe they are, and in some  ways I agree, but there are many ways to express opinion, and calling a  readers ideas &quot;so ridiculous&quot; is too judgmental for a spirit who  claims not to judge at all.<br />Anyone interested in an honest, more  entertaining take on spirit should definitely read &quot;Conversations With  God&quot; by Neale Donald Walsch.	2000-05-16

Farrelly creates interaction between teenagers very realistically at times, but other characters, specifically the father, seem less so. It is had to imagine a maturing teenager tolerating being called  &quot;Dildo&quot; by his own father. At times, the father appears down  right cruel and very ignorant (and not very believable).  Of course, Tim,  the main character, must overcome his father's glaring callousness and the  arrogance of his rich friends at his private school. But this does not seem  to ever occur. Instead, Tim leaves the school still bitter about his  experience and of course must go back home now to -- guess who? -- his  father who he dubiously loves.

She presents only one side of the argument (the  &quot;right&quot; to kill yourself whenever you want), and she does so only  superficially. The legal stuff in the book is simply glossed over, although  researching the protocol of a trial is rough. Besides these little minor  annoyances, buy this book. A powerful read.	1998-10-09

Many humorous parts, but over all a  novel that can make you think without boring you to death.	1998-10-09

Her mis-titled &quot;Prozac Nation,&quot; may be her peak  proformance, depite some major problems in that book. This pseudo-feminist  stuff comes straight from &quot;Cosmo,&quot; &quot;Glamour,&quot; etc. Save  your $$.	1998-09-24

As a former depressive, it is true that depression is more than a strong case of the blues, but to lament on the experience for 350 pages is enough for the reader to fall into a depression of their own.  Right in the middle of this book, the author stands on her soap-box and proceeds to preach to the reader about the virtues of abortion, and how she herself &quot;would not have thought about [getting an abortion]&quot; had she found out before her miscarriage. My sympathies were lost for her at this point, and it was apparent the author was on a completely irrelevant topic. Meanwhile, issue of Prozac as quite secondary to this book, but I do find it extreme hypocrisy for Wurtzel or anyone else to dismiss any antidepressant as a &quot;happy-pill.&quot; I remind Wurtzel and her readers that Prozac is not the problem, but the countless psychologists who misdiagnose depression are. It is puzzling that Wurtzel, who rants endlessly about her perpetual sadness, has the guts to even breathe a negative thought about a drug that apparently saved her from suicide. Her commentary was beyond the scope of the book, and she would have done well to sing Prozac's praises.	1998-04-10

William Styron's 'Darkness Visible' provided a vivid portrait of the hell depression can make one's life. Fine prose and deep understanding on an agonizing experience to have to endure.	1998-04-07

Auster catches readers (like myself) snoozing from time to time, and although the plot becomes a great spiderweb of sorts, his prose lays out complexities smoothly. A fine, original piece of writing.	1998-04-07
