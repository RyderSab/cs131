So is it true that mental illness is caused by unhappiness, rather than chemical imbalances in our brains?<br />Dr. William Glasser has devoted over 40 years of his professional life proving that so-called mental illnesses can be cured (or made healthy again) by having happy marital, family, teacher-student, and manager-worker relationships.  He believes it's time to remove the plague of the old school of psychiatry, which actually causes a physical impairment of the brain (where there once was none) and then hinders a person's chance for true happiness and mental health.<br />If you, or someone you know, have symptoms such as depression, attention deficit, anger, hyperactivity, migraine headaches, anxiety or panic attacks, then I urge you to get this book and read it.<br />Dr. Glasser is an internationally recognized psychiatrist who is best known as the creator of Reality Therapy, a method of psychotherapy that is taught all over the world. His approach is considered non-traditional, because he does not believe in a person being labeled mentally ill unless something organically wrong with the brain.<br />The major purpose of this book is to teach the world \\"Choice Theory,\\" which is aimed at proactively creating mental health through happy human relationships.  In a nut shell, Choice Theory says people can only be responsible for their own choices, and by forcing our choices on other people we cause a break down in the relationship, which in turn makes us very unhappy. In our unhappy state, our perfectly healthy brain acts in such a way as to try to regain control over the other person by inflicting symptoms that are commonly attributed to mental disease on ourselves.<br />For instance, when someone is diagnosed with depression, they are choosing to depress (they are \\"depressing\\") so that they can gain the upperhand (its a form of getting bad attention).  However, when choose to proactively control their own thoughts and actions in a mature way, thus gainning the respect and admiration of the people they love and care for, they will return to a very happy state and not need to use the external contol mechanism of \\"depressing.\\" The same works for paining, panicing, angering, crazying, etc.<br />Dr. Glasser points out there are \\"7 Deadly Habits\\" that lead to totally ineffective people. We use them to try to gain control over others, wrongly thinking that they will make us happy. They are:<br />Critizing<br />Blaming<br />Complaining<br />Nagging<br />Threatening<br />Punishing (Abusing)<br />and Bribing<br />I interviewed Dr. Glasser on \\"The Inside Success Show\\" and he was inspiring! If I hadn't already believed in the power of great relationships to make people happy, I would after talking with him.<br />Here's some other things I learned from Dr. Glasser:<br />**  How Dr. Glasser found out about the 'dark side' of Psychiatry<br />**  Why common brain drugs like Prozac and Ritalin make you ill<br />**  What 7 good habits help you to avoid anger, depression, and anxiety<br />**  How to quickly turn around sour relationships using Choice Theory<br />**  Why it is always better to get rid of false beliefs than punish others<br />**  How to supercharge your mental health with a little known \\"phrase\\" that you can say to yourself<br />**  And much, much more ...<br />If you want to rid yourself of \\"UNHAPPY-itis\\" and be completely mentally fit (it's like the difference between being out-of-shape and being fit enough to run a marathon), then I highly recommend reading this book.<br />Randy (Dr. Proactive) Gilbert, Host of The Inside Success Show ([...]) and best-selling author of  \\"Success Bound\\"when choose to proactively control their own thoughts and actions in a mature way, thus gainning the respect and admiration of the people they love and care for, they will return to a very happy state and not need to use the external contol mechanism of \\"depressing.\\" The same works for paining, panicing, angering, crazying, etc.<br />Dr. Glasser points out there are \\"7 Deadly Habits\\" that lead to totally ineffective people.

As a retired Coast Guard officer, someone trained to do just what those policemen and firemen did on September 11, this one in particular strikes at my heart strings - I found myself crying, then laughing, then struck with an overwhelming love for my country and all of the people that make up this great land.<br />It's this book that inspired the following article.<br />******<br />\\"Proactive Prosperity: How To Keep Filling Your Glass\\"<br />By Randy Gilbert (c)2002<br />A kindly looking man, who worked as a janitor in the World Trade Center, approached an old and graying homeless woman one cold September morning last year. She looked chilled as she stood there clinging to her shopping cart containing all of her meager belongings.<br />The janitor smiled and held out an old thermos to the woman and said to her, \\"This old thermos has been my friend for many years and I want you to have it. It's a very special thermos, because as long as you share its contents, it always has enough for everyone. Please take it, for I have a feeling I won't be needing it any more after today.\\"<br />Do you have a favorite book that you read over and over again? I have one that tells about how people view the world and the profound impact that it has on their lives. It uses an age-old illustration of how some see a glass half empty and others half full. As I pondered this again, a story-like vision came to me, which doesn't happen often, so I paid close attention.<br />The clear glass that I was picturing turned into a metal thermos, like the ones carried by construction workers. Instead of big hands, small hands in tattered gloves held it. An old woman was stooping down in front of a small child and her mother. It was snowing and they were clinging to each other for warmth.<br />The old woman asked the little girl, \\"would you like some sweet warm cocoa?\\" She used the thermos top as a cup and I could see steam rise as she placed the cup in half frozen little hands. The girl drank it down and then flashed the biggest smile she had ever smiled and her eyes shown as bright as a rainbow.<br />\\"Mommy, is she an angel?\\" the little girl asked. \\"Yes dear, and that is what we're going to become. Do you remember that happy song we used to sing when your daddy was still alive?\\" They began singing the sweetest and most enchanting melody. People walking by and those coming up from the subway station were drawn to them as if by magic.<br />Some people stood there transfixed, tears welling in their eyes. Others said a quiet \\"thank you\\" and laid money down on the walk in front of them.<br />Two of the listeners were a young boy and his father. They had been shopping and the well-dressed man held a large bag of packages. \\"Father, are they angels?\\" the son asked. \\"Yes, I think so, and that is what we are going to become. Do you remember we used to make gifts when your mommy was with us and give them to people who needed them?\\"<br />The father reached into his bag and began handing the bright packages to his son, who gave them out to the homeless people along the street. I thought to myself, this is truly a miracle, the bag seemed to never empty.<br />My attention was drawn to a man in a wheelchair who received a shiny red pocketknife. In a voice that was choking back tears, he said, \\"Thanks son, I lost one just like this in Nam. You know, I used to be quite a toy maker; I can whittle just about anything with a knife.\\"<br />The story in my mind began to fade as he wheeled himself up the sidewalk and breathlessly said, \\"I know an alley where I can get some wood and I'm going to start sharing this gift right now.\\"<br />Wow, that's what it means to be proactive. Pessimists see the glass as half empty. They say, \\"it's not enough.\\" Their negative attitude causes them to turn inward and be selfish. When a decision comes along they believe their doubts, which turn into fears, which then produces unhealthy stress and anxieties. They end up experiencing the lack they saw in their minds.<br />Optimists see the glass as half full. They say, \\"I'm happy to enjoy whatever life gives me.\\" However, their positive attitude of sufficiency doesn't last long, especially after a few swallows are taken and the glass is nearly empty. Optimism without prosperity becomes a limiting belief of being content with poverty.<br />However, Proactive people see the glass as something to be used, both for themselves and to serve others. Like the thermos in the story-vision, there will always be abundance. You're a very special person. As long as you share your contents, you'll always have enough for everyone.<br />This story-vision extends to other things, such as your smile, your talents, your bank account, the skills you've acquired, and the knowledge you have. Your life will always have these in abundance if you use them to serve others.<br />Prosperity is not a glass half empty or half full; it's you becoming a glass and being used to bring joy and abundance to others, knowing that your source of supply will never run dry.<br />###<br />I have a very high regard for Mark, that's why I incorporated many of his philosophies into my life and into my first book \\"Success Bound.\\"  When it was completed I sent him a copy to read.

Please forgive the soapbox style of review here. I think the authors are right-on, and if you will take what they write to heart (not just seek information, but seek transformation) you will look and feel great for the rest of your life.<br />It's that time of the year again and most of us are beginning to pull out the summer things. I can hear the screams now. Oh my goodness - how did my clothes shrink so much!  Many are searching Amazon looking for the latest &quot;lose weight&quot; book.<br />WAIT . . . STOP . . . DON'T!<br />Before you spend any of your precious money on those other fad diet books, consider the following.  How come some people always seem to be lean and trim, no matter what the season? Do you think it's because they are on a perpetual diet?<br />I don't thinks so. You see, I have been there and done that. Sure, some of those diet and exercise plans work a little, but only a little, and only while they are relentlessly followed.<br />Those fad plans aren't the best way for us to be lean and healthy because the weight problem is in our heads.  Research now shows that the poor health of our bodies is just a symptom of improper thinking.  The real problem is:<br />YOU HAVE TOO MUCH FEAR IN YOUR DIET!<br />Just like cholesterol, there are good fears and bad fears. Most likely, you are allowing too much of the bad fear to get into your mind.  Bad fears cause the problems that jack up the weight, increase the waistline, and leave you short of breath when climbing stairs.<br />YOU CAN ELIMINATE BAD FEARS IN THREE STEPS<br />Eliminating bad fears from you life is not that complicated.  You can rid yourself of the bad types of fears that keep you from the success and abundance you deserve.<br />First, you need to know what causes bad fears.  Just like real estate pricing, bad fears are caused by 3 things: ignorance, ignorance, and ignorance.<br />THE CURE IS: LEARN, DO, AND REWARD<br />Eliminate the first ignorance by learning.  You must learn what is right for you.  Read this book and it will tell you our bodies are all different.  Your needs for nourishment, exercise, and sleep are different from anyone else.  Learn what your &quot;healthy zone&quot; is and many of the fears that cause you to be out of shape will disappear immediately.<br />Eliminate the second ignorance by doing. Train your brain to do what is right. Emerson said, &quot;Do the thing you fear and the death of fear is certain.&quot; Start slowly and work your way up to staying in your healthy zone. Don't be afraid of mistakes. Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly at first.<br />Eliminate the third ignorance by discovering the rewards and opportunities. Reward yourself for that slim waistline; buy something sexy. Take advantage of the opportunities; look great in front of that audience. If you eat something that was just too good to pass up, don't worry. Get back into your healthy zone at the next meal.<br />Read this book; follow these three steps and you will rid yourself of the bad fears and their accompanying health problems. Soon, success and abundance will be yours and you'll always look great!<br />Don't be afraid to buy this book - it is not a fad diet book.at is right for you.
