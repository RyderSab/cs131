The Conservatives will rate it high because it does tell the truth. <br /> <br />The behavior of the people Goldberg describes is unarguably observable.  These hypocrits of the left own homes in lands where they cut down forests to build second or third vacation homes so they could ski on the other land they deforested.  They buy up ranch land and other large acreage in the beautiful western states of America that were once areas where average people enjoyed their pastoral and slower pace of life.  They cut down trees and subdivide mountainsides so they can have a view lot where they build a vacation home far more expensive than even a CEO of a corporation can afford, just so they can have a view of the beautiful mountain lake they pollute with their boats.  They own, or charter, planes that consume more fuel in one of their shopping or holiday trips than all the SUVs in California use in a week. <br /> <br />Hollyierd actors make huge sums of money making movies so full of violence, graphic sex, and foul language that the movies have to be rated.  Then they deny that their movies have a bad influence on children.  They use guns to kill people in movies while they play the heoric gunman, or even the beloved outlaw, then they scream for gun control.  They marry and divorce so frequently people have to ask who was the father of this or that child.  And, their use of alcohol and drugs is so out of control their own children die of alcoholism and drug overdose, but they want to tell us how to run a country. <br /> <br />Leftist college professors, many of whom have never run a company, invented anything, created jobs for anyone, or did much of anything but read a book, want to tell us what's wrong with America, and what we need to do to correct it.  Never mind that that they know nothing about the business world, except what they read in a book, or how decent, honest, hard working people live and think. <br /> <br />As Goldberg has said, Americans don't want racism, poverty, and ignorance; no one does.  No country is perfect, even the left wingers beloved Cuba; just ask the refugees.  Things that are wrong should be corrected.  Very few would disgree with that.  But comparing America to fascists states, and cursing those that would protect us, is NOT improving things.  If these leftists think it's so bad here, maybe they should go where they think things are better.  For the most part, the rest of us don't want to destroy the best lifstyle on the planet, but if we leave it up to the rabid left, that's exactly what will happen. <br /> <br />Read this book, it tells the truth.	2005-08-18

Every leftist, \\"liberal\\", radical feminist, illegal immigrant, welfare recipient, lesbian, abortionist, PETA animal killer, and the rest of the blue state, big city dwellers (where else would these people be other than hiding in the big cities?) has rushed to \\"review\\" a book they haven't read, in defense of their socialist icon. <br /> <br />Notice also, that, as is the case with most hypocritical leftists who live a lie, many don't even have the courage to give honest personal names and information.  This is nothing more or less than we've come to expect from those who would tear down the very system that gave them everything they have.  These are the same people who will believe what that sicko Kitty Kelley writes, but yell \\"foul\\" when another author exposes Hillary for what we all know her to be. <br /> <br />I have not read the whole book, but I have read parts, and many reviews and commentaries from many sources.  Bottom line: Despite all the rantings and ravings against this book by all the people wanting the government to take care of them from the cradle to the grave, the truth is Hillary is bad for the American way of life that has made us what we are, both good and bad.  We can work on the bad, but we should NOT \\"cut off our nose to spite our face\\" by electing an anti-American as Der Fuehrer.	2005-06-23

You don't know about the good because the \\"People's Propaganda\\" machines will not print it. <br /> <br />Of course, the WP will find, or dream up, or twist, or misinterpret, or tell half-truths and lies about Clarence Thomas.  That's what they live for; to tell all the worst things they can dream up about every conservative.  Did you see these major newspapers support Clinton's accusers like they supported the lying Anita Hill? Anyone could watch Anita and tell she was a liar; it was all over her face, and was apparent in her demeanor.

I enjoyed it so much that today, about 12 years after I read it the first time, I began a search for a copy to replace the copy I've lost.  I was excited to see that there is a new edition. I was not excited to read the low reviews of the educationally-handicapped. <br /> <br />It is very obvious that the \\"reviewer\\" We spent TAX MONEY on this airhead jerk off drill?, August 30, 2004 Reviewer: John H. Jennings (Bedford, Texas USA), is either too unintelligent to understand the book, or is a liar who has never read it. <br /> <br />Speaking of liars, the writer of \\"Oh why the Marines\\" probably never met a Marine who had any of this training, as is obvious from the Marine's review who does know these Marines. <br /> <br />Then there's the \\"reviewer\\" Too self absorbed, May 3, 2003 <br />Reviewer: A reader, who didn't even have the courage to use their name as the reviewer.  Why is it so hard to understand that a book about a person's experience is about the person? How is that self-absorbed?  Hello, there, is anyone home?  <br /> <br />I believe that with the number of people involved in the martial arts since this book was written, there will be more people who understand the meaning and purpose of what the experiment was aimed at in this program. Of course, there will be detractors among those in the martial arts, and I know some; however, everyone studying a martial art is not necessarily of the highest \\"martial spirit\\"; for many there involvement is just a hobby, for exercise, or maybe self-defense, or even to be the \\"tough guy on the block\\". Many of those types wold not understand higher-order thinking, as is attempted in this program. <br /> <br />I just ordered the new edition.  I will read it and edit my comments with an in-depth review.  I just wrote this to encourage people who read these reviews to follow the advice and recommendations of the highest reviews.  These are people who have honestly read and understand what is being said.

There is nothing new here.  As always, no one will be convinced either way with this kind of sophomoric rhetoric. The answers to his questions depend on who is answering them, and who is listening to the answers. Questioners and responders will answer according to their bias, and little will be gained by the debate, as is usually the case. For some, there is an obvious and fully acceptable answer to all the questions; for others, no answer on earth could satisfy them, as has been the case for centuries. <br /> <br />Answers from Christian apologists abound in infinite number throughout the Catholic religion, and from all Protestant sects. <br /> <br />I did have to give it one star because of Amazon's stupid rating system.

It reads like a romance novel much of the time, especially the first half.  I think this book may be better-liked by women.  I don't mean that as a \\"put-down\\" in any way.  I mean there is far more about his relationship with his wife than about Iraq. <br /> <br />In spite of its title, \\"Back in Action\\", it is NOT an action story, and certainly not a thriller.  However, it is a look into the life of an army couple who give more for their country than their critics have ever even considered. <br /> <br />Does it inspire?  That depends on who you are. If you are like the left wing radical  R. J. Pooley Jr. \\"eyes open\\", whose ignorant criticism of the book reflects not only his political bias, but his callousness toward disabled heros, the answer is a resounding \\"NO\\". There will be many cowards and weakling critics among the left, like  R. J. Pooley Jr. \\"eyes open\\", who will use their review as a platform to spew their political garbage.  <br /> <br />If you truly love your country; if you have had prolonged absences from your spouse and children, due to either military or civilian service for your country, you will be far more understanding.  The book is about soul-searching, not war. It is about relationships, not political intrigue; and it is about love, courage, devotion to duty, and a strength a critic like  R. J. Pooley Jr. \\"eyes open\\" cannot understand. It is far beyond these type of people to understand someone stronger and more courageos than they are. <br /> <br />Unless you are tainted by hate, anger, political bias, and just plain ignorance, you will be touched by the description of the phyically handicapped and how so many of them overcome terrible disabilities and become as successful, or more successful, and certainly more praiseworthy, than those who stayed home and criticized. <br /> <br />And,if you have the slightest bit of patriotism in your soul you will be touched by the soldier's devotion, not only to his country, but to his fellow soldier, and the United States Army.	2005-03-05

Every organization has its dissenters and apostates. The LDS Church is no exception.  Most people who write anti-Mormon books and other trash \\"literature\\", have either never been a member, and know nothing first-hand from being a member, or have some personality trait, or bad experience that turns them against the Church.  These types of people find it easy to hate that with which they disagree or had a problem with. One great example comes from the hateful person who wrote this \\"review\\", \\"It's apparent from the reviews that Mormons HATE this book..\\", February 8, 2005 Reviewer: Walking in Truth (Wimberley, TX United States) Of course, this type of person rarely has the intestinal fortitude, or pride, to use their real name and information.  I don't blame them, if I wrote trash like \\"I hate the Mormon Church\\", I would be embarrassed also.   <br /> <br />This guy says it all.  He at least admits to hating the Church. That makes it pretty apparent to even the most casual observer that this person has some other problems as well.  To hate something you disagree with shows a huge character flaw. This is the kind of intolerance, bigotry, misunderstanding, and behavior that is destroying our society, and, indeed, the world.  Hitler hated Christian churches.  Stalin hated religion.  Look what happened. <br /> <br />Books written by religious zealots whose primary intent and purpose, no matter what they say, is to \\"put down\\" that with which they disagree are fuel that feeds the fire of hate. That hate destroys, and it very often destroys the person who hates. <br /> <br />I highly recommend that anyone that is truly a seeker of the truth,  or even just wants to balance their information--Mormon-basher against Mormons--read the many books written by converts to the LDS Church from other religions.  There are many, as there are several thousand converts to the Church for every one apostate.  One book written by a Protestant convert to the Church is \\"WHY WOULD ANYONE JOIN THE MORMON CHURCH\\" I humbly suggest that you read this book before you check off that this review was no help to you.  If you do, then, no matter how you feel in the end, this review will be a help to you. <br />	2005-03-02

Before you read this hate book take a couple of minutes to observe the behavior of many anti-Mormons  [...]  -----------------------------------------------------------  The National Conference of Christians and Jews - Summary Review    An ad hoc committee from The National Conference of Christians and Jews (Arizona Chapter) produced an evaluation of the Godmakers movie. This committee was made up of:    3 Roman Catholics   1 Methodist   2 Presbyterians   1 Disciples of Christ   7 Jews   1 Greek Orthodox   2 Mormons (Not Robert Brown, Rosemary Brown or Gilbert Scharffs)   Highlights from their report stated:  The film does not - in our opinion - fairly portray the Mormon Church, Mormon history, or Mormon belief. It makes extensive use of 'half-truth', faulty generalizations, erroneous interpretations, and sensationalism. It is not reflective of the genuine spirit of the Mormon faith.    We find particularly offensive the emphasis in the film that Mormonism is some sort of subversive plot - a danger to the community, a threat to the institution of marriage, and is destructive to the mental health of teenagers. All of our experience with our Mormon neighbors provides eloquent refutation of these charges.    We are of the opinion that The Godmakers relies heavily on appeals to fear, prejudice and other less worthy human emotions. We believe that continued use of this film poses genuine danger to the climate of good will and harmony which currently exists between Valley neighbors of differing faiths. It appears to us to be a basically unfair and untruthful presentation of what Mormons really believe and practice.    We believe that most fair-minded people who would happen to view this film would be appalled by it, because their attitudes have been previously formed through many day-to-day experiences with Mormons which demonstrate that they are good friends, neighbors and fellow citizens. (Brown 1995, 67-68)   --------------------------------------------------------------  by Van Hale    The movie \\"The Godmakers,\\" released early in 1983, is the production of several ex-Mormons who are now ultra-conservative Christians. In addition to a number of obvious errors, distortions, and the like, the producers of the movie use a clever technique throughout. Mormon beliefs are re-phrased in the producer's own sensational and offensive terms. The result is a most unfair portrayal of Mormonism. For example, Mormons often express belief that man is in the image of God. In the movie this is re-phrased, to present, as Mormon belief, that God is an \\"extra-terrestrial humanoid.\\"    This technique can, of course, be used to disparage any system of belief. For example, the following paragraphs are presented as a statement of the beliefs of the producers of \\"The Godmakers.\\"(emphasis added) It sounds bizarre and offensive, not because it inaccurately presents their beliefs, but rather because their beliefs have been re-phrased in sensational and offensive terms. It is, thus, unfair, just as is their portrayal of Mormonism presented in the film.    A being of three separate persons at the same time, God is a mysterious schizophrenic. He decided to try out mortality, and thus became the only extraterrestrial ever to become a humanoid. To do this he created a woman named Mary, and after an unnatural conception to this unwed mother-to-be, he became her illegitimate, half-breed son.    He suffered a self-inflicted stroke of amnesia, and had to re-develop even the most basic abilities. As his supernatural powers began to return, he traveled through the area talking with demons, and as a human god, succeeded in impressing many with spectacular feats of magic. He wanted a large following, and offered the bribe that all who would became his groupies would never be held accountable for any of their wicked deeds, no matter how heinous. He threatened that he would see to it, that those who would not follow him would be tortured by burning forever, and ever, withno possible relief.     He had outraged a number of the leading citizens to the point that they wanted to put him to death. Still a young man, he decided he had had enough of mortality, and wanted to return to his former state, but he did not want to suffer the death his enemies had planned for him. After a chat with his father, he carried out his father's will, which was that he leave mortality only after a moving drama in which he was offered as a human sacrifice, the condition upon which the father agreed to make good the incredible promises the son had made to his followers.  ------------------------------------------------------------  [...]	2005-02-26

This book is nothing but a politically-driven, left-wing, anti-Christian polemic.<br /><br />Books like this are a gathering place for atheists, agnostics, anti-Christians, anti-Mormons, and hate mongers of all types. This book is written by a left-wing Jewish professor who obviously despises Christianity in any form. Because of this fact, reviews on books like this become sounding boards for the ignorant who hate everything that does not agree with them, or that they do not understand. It's rather odd that the respect and tolerance that most Christians have for Jews is not returned by many of the very same Jews that suffer persecution themselves. If a Christian were to write a book about Jews and Judaism with the same snide remarks and disrespect for the Jewish religion that is contained in this book about Christians, the \\"politically correct\\" would have no end of nasty criticism.<br /><br />What may be even worse is that Bloom represents what seems to be becoming the majority of professors of his ilk.  Many college and university professors have complete freedom of speech in their classroms, as long as they agree with the student and the student agrees with them.  What is contained in this book is representative of what can be found in the classrooms of our colleges and universities.<br /><br />In the small section on Mormonism Bloom has managed to write the worst and most ignorant comments on the Church I have yet seen.<br /><br />I know this is mostly a book Mormon-bashers, and those intolerant of any religion other than their own, are most likely to read, but possibly there is a sincere person who will read this and wants to know the truth from the members of a religion that Bloom apparently knows nothing about.<br /><br />As the review in FAIR says, \\"Bloom habitually characterizes those who disagree with his politics as dangerous fanatics: so Bloom calls Baptists and Mormons a \\"dangerously strong coalition of American Religionists that now guarantee the continued ascendancy of the Reagan-Bush dynasty\\" (p. 269). More pernicious is Bloom's op-ed column in the New York Times; promoting the book, it updates the last few pages, identifying Mormons with a combination imperiling American liberties.<br /><br />My review follows:<br />Only the ignorant can be impressed by this vituperative garbage. I suggest those with any doubt read the 12th Article of Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints: The Articles of Faith - #12:<br />\\"We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.\\"<br /><br />Or, perhaps it could be made clearer by quoting a former Church President, David O. McKay: \\"We warn our people in America of the constantly increasing threat against our inspired Constitution and our free institutions set up under it. The same political tenets and philosophies that have brought war and terror in other parts of the world are at work amongst us in America. The proponents thereof are seeking to undermine our own form of government and to set up instead one of the forms of dictatorship now flourishing in other lands............\\"<br /><br />Maybe this quote will make it clearer: \\"......I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose.....\\" Doctrine and Covenants 101, Verse 80<br /><br />And, from the Journal of Discourses, \\"....Joseph (Smith)....declared...that the time would come when the Constitution...would be in danger of an overthrow; and, said he, If the Constitution be saved at all it will be by the Elders of this Church.\\" Orson Hyde, 1858. Journal of Discourses, Volume 6, Page 152<br /><br />There is almost no group more threatening to the Constitution than college professors. A liberal group, at best, and probably more socialist/Marxist than liberal, as a group they support almost every left-wing politician in American politics. These are the people, and their ilk, which threaten the Constitution, and strive for power at every level of government, not Mormons. These are the people, as demonstrated in this last election, who are looking for the overthrow of a free America, as we know it. These are those that threaten every part of the Constitution they don't agree with, but use parts they agree with, like free speech, to burn the flag and condemn our present way of life. These are the anti-Americans who preach tolerance, but practice intolerance towards anything they don't agree with. And, or course, right in line with their bigotry, hatred, intolerance, and ignorance, these are the people who will mark \\"NO\\" this review didn't help them. Of course, it didn't; if you come to review a book that you know contains ammunition to hatefully shoot down beliefs other than your own, what would you say? Blind hate and intolerance are two big reasons for the holocaust. This book is an example of why that happened. If we really want no more holocausts, then maybe it would be a good idea not to write inflammatory, ignorant, and hateful books. But, that's a no-brainer isn't it? Well, of course it is, but then the book and the author are \\"no-brainers\\", too.<br /><br />There is no more patriotic American than those among the members of the LDS Church. This book reads like a paranoid adolescent afraid of the dark. This author should be ashamed of his duplicity.	2005-02-07

By 1530 over 2000 Anabaptists had suffered cruel and inhuman deaths. Is this not insanity?  From several encyclopedias we learn that Luther rejected all who disagreed with him and branded them as heretics. He was the victim of an interior struggle that made him writhe in the throes of racking anxiety, distressing doubts and agonizing reproaches of conscience.  He also had an irrepressible outbreak of sensuality which assailed him with unbridled fury, to which was added the intensifying stimulus of his imprudent gratification of his appetite for eating and drinking. In addition to his horror, his temptations, moral and spiritual, becamme vivid realities; satanic manifestations were frequent and alarming. And this author has the unmitigated gall to accuse Joseph Smith of a mental disorder?    Then there's that \\"wonderful\\" relationship between Luther and Ulrich Zwingli. Zwingli, like Luther, resorted to use of force, submission, and death of his opponents, committing the same atrocities for which he condemned the papacy of committing. Zwingli was slain at age 47.  The Catholics quartered his body and burned it on a dung pyre.  Luther remarked that it was \\"the judgement of heaven on a heathen.....\\"  Sweet Christian love, huh? Joseph Smith never had such 'love' for those who disagreed with him.    How about John Calvin who hated everyone who disagreed with him and subjected them to reproof, excommunication, banishment, and death. Calvin practiced strict non-toleration practices and his controls over his \\"subjects\\" of his \\"City of God\\", as he called Geneva.  There he forced his religion on all the inhabitants of Geneva.  Between 1542 and 1564 there were 76 banishments and 58 executions.  You, dear reader, might want to read upon the murder of Michael Severtus, which Calvin was responsible for [...] Now, that's a mental case.    I could go on and on about the witch hunts, burnings at the stake, burning of homes, persecution of anyone who disagreed with various Protestant sects, and so on....  These are historical facts, not some rantings by a wacked-out mental case.  Check it out before you say this review didn't help you.  Mormon-bashers beware, the truth will out....	2005-01-26

This election proved what many of us have been saying for years; the media is dishonest, unfair, biased, and almost totally left-wing. There were days I almost got nauseated reading the Washington Post online. No longer can the newspapers (pulp fiction?) deny their left-wing bias. It was out there in full force and not denied. ABC, CBS, and NBC were as bad as the newspapers. I suppose Dan Rather is not a 'noise machine'. His kind of slanted, twisted, biased, left-wing reporting is what we have put up with in all the media for years. But, when the conservatives try to promote their agenda (which is what politics is all about) that's a 'bad thing'. Just look at the Hollywierdos' attempt to silence Sinclair television. It's alright if they produce inflammatory movies, besmirch TV personalities in their sitcoms and dramas on TV, and do whatever else they like. But when the conservative try to express their views in much the same way, then this clown calls them a 'noise machine'. I may be overwrought, but I can't help calling this author a liar and propagandist with some kind of personal agenda.

I have, however, read parts, and have seen the judge on Fox many times.  I've read the reviews here, and I felt I had to comment on the one thing I've seen and heard about that is TOTALLY WRONG; the statement that the U.S. Civil War was over slavery.  That's just plain NOT TRUE. <br /> <br />I know many educators teach this, including well-known university professors.  However, these people usually have a bias and a political agenda. <br /> <br />The Civil War was fought over the same thing the American Revolution was fought over; states' rights, taxation without representation, less and less voice in the government as time went by, and to a much less degree the right to make their own laws concerning slavery.  Slavery, then, became the \\"political football\\" that was used as a cause for the war, but not until after Ms Stowe wrote \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\", a very extreme and embellished story of slavery. <br /> <br />This is not to say that slavery is not wrong, and was not somewhat of a factor in the civil war.  However, vey few soldiers in the North were fighting to abolish slavery.  They were fighting to preserve their own way of life.  Many were just as racist as those in the South.  In fact, many white groups from various parts of Europe and the rest of the world, hated each other over their differences.  They all wanted to be free to establish their own culture and way of life, and not be dominated by government and other groups they hated. <br /> <br />There you have it; the plain fact.  That's the way it was.  Abolishing slavery was not a factor until long into the war.  Abraham Lincoln's original objective was to preserve the Union, and only to preserve the Union.  Abolishing slavery was probably a distant second for him. <br /> <br />What most people don't understand is that some states in the North had threatened to secede before the South did, and over much the same reasons; not slavery. <br /> <br />The next time your collegeprofessor tries to tell you the fable about the \\"war over slavery\\" ask him to tell you the one about George Washington chopping down the cherry tree.  Fables make for good reading, as does a lot of fiction.	2005-01-07

Here is a small part of it: <br /> <br />\\"He (Krakauer) points out that Mormons and fundamentalists have all the same beliefs (which will greatly surprise both groups), but \\"diverge on one especially inflammatory point of religious doctrine\\"--polygamy. <br /> <br />Krakauer deftly establishes a connection between the Church and fundamentalists, so he can color the lot with the same spray paint. (Of course, deftness has never been a synonym for accuracy, but such a distinction would be largely lost on a reader uneducated in LDS history.) Krakauer never does indicate why the LDS Church should accept responsibility for offshoots of the main Church, nor does he indicate what form any supposed responsibility should take. Apparently it is not enough to excommunicate them from the Church and cooperate with law enforcement authorities, where appropriate. <br /> <br />Chapter 4, \\"Elizabeth and Ruby,\\" tackles the news about Elizabeth Smart. We learn that by \\"adroitly manipulating the religious indoctrination Elizabeth had received since she was old enough to talk, [Brian David] Mitchell cowed the girl into becoming an utterly submissive polygamous concubine.\\" We also find out that \\"the white robes Mitchell and Barzee wore, and forced Elizabeth to wear, resemble the sacred robes she had donned with her family when they entered the Mormon temple.\\" Such statements, of course, only serve to underscore Krakauer's ability to manipulate reality to fit a good story. He never points out that Elizabeth was kidnapped when she was fourteen, and youth in the LDS Church don't attend the temple until they are at least twelve. Assuming that Elizabeth had attended the temple during those two years, the clothing she would see while there would be little different from a young Catholic girl's communion dress. At her age, Elizabeth never would have \\"donned\\" any robes in the temple, nor seen anyone else there in those robes. <br />In Chapter 6, \\"Cumorah,\\" Krakauer starts with a discussion of the Palmyra Pageant, and digresses to explain the Book of Mormon and how it came about. He incorrectly points out that \\"the Hill Cumorah is one of the holiest sites in all of Mormondom, and sooner or later most Latter-day Saints make a pilgrimage here.\\" He talks about the Palmyra Pageant, and the well-behaved people who attend. \\"Order, needless to say, prevails. This is a culture that considers obedience to be among the highest virtues.\\" (Obviously Krakauer didn't attend any Primary Activity Days or Elder's Quorum basketball games during his research.) <br /> <br />....turning to our belief, states that \\"such criticism and mockery are largely beside the point. All religious belief is a function of nonrational faith. And faith, by its very definition, tends to be impervious to intellectual argument or academic criticism.\\" In other words, Krakauer does not understand any religious faith, but the Mormons make a titillating story possible, even if the story is only passably recognizable to those who practice the faith.\\"	2005-01-07

US	52685625	R2V6FO0ZICUKSV	B0006EZGZO	786295207	The truth about Mormonism: A former adherent analyzes the LDS faith	Books	1	4	7	N	N	Read the following before even thinking about this book	[...]    \\"In spite of its misleading title, this book has little to do with \\"the truth about Mormonism.\\" Although it claims to represent the fruits of years of study and \\"exhaustive research,\\" the author cannot hide the fact that he has failed to do his homework. Ignoring the complexities of Mormonism and its founding book will not make those complexities go away. Since 1830, over 2000 anti-Mormon works like Langfield's have been published. Over half of those have been published since 1960 and a third since 1970 alone.51 It is perhaps significant that during those last thirty years The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has grown faster than at any other time in its history,52 fulfilling in certain measure the prediction of Brigham Young: \\"Every time you kick Mormonism you kick it upstairs; You never kick it downstairs. The Lord Almighty so orders it.\\" Although we can be confident, as the Church continues to grow, that the Book of Mormon will continue to be an object of attack and ridicule, critics will get little consolation from Langfield's book. They will never bury Mormonism with a shovel like this.\\"    The above quote is so true. If the Mormon haters that write these kinds of book understood how many thousands of people join the LDS Chruch, not in spite of, but because of these bigoted, intolerant, and dihonest authors, maybe they would wake up and realize that like the hateful Hollywood personalities whose disgusting behavior caused many people to vote against John Kerry--the opposite of the intent of their propaganda--the same thing is happening with intelligent people who realize that so many of the accusations in these books are either outright lies or embellishments, half-truths, and, at best, misunderstandings, and it causes them to investigate the Church for the truth.    In the last couple of decades there has been a large decrease in so-called \\"mainline\\" Protestant sects.  There are many reasons for this, among them a better educated and better read population that realizes there are many beliefs and creeds, much of it borrowed from the Catholic Church that are not in the Bible, and are the imagination of well-meaning, but misguided monks and clergy of the Middle Ages, and corrupt priests, Popes, and royalty. That does not mean that the members of these Protestant sects are NOT Christian. It does mean they believe in doctrines that are not found in the Bible, but originated in Greek philosophy and other sources.     Nowhere in the Bible does it tell us to be a member of any one sect/cult/denomination.  Jesus did not come to this earth to establish a Church.  No church, as we think of a \\"church\\" today, was established until long after the death of Jesus.  Catholics and Protestants have put a lot of emphasis on being \\"religiously correct\\", or \\"sect correct\\". They don't even agree among themselves, and yet they accept each other as Christians.    Mainline \\"Orthodox\\" Protestant sects have declined in membership also due to their bigotry, intolerance, hatred, and ANTI-gospel which they constantly preach against others who also feel they are Christian.  They use the word \\"cult\\" as a degrading, ugly word with malicious meaning while failing to realize they are also cults (\\"cult\\", \\"sect\\", \\"denomination\\" are all synonyms from which we get the term \\"non-sectarian\\" or \\"non-denominational\\"). The same term has been applied to everyone of the Protestant sects at one time or another.  And, they almost all developed in somewhat the same way the Mormons did; many through persecution and the leadership of one or more men/women--Luther, Calvin, Hus, Zwingli, Roger Williams,etc.-- who started a new sect due to differences with, or persecution against, their different beliefs.  Of course, then, we all know the horrendous persecution they visited upon the Mormons once they were finally accepted as mainline Christians.    Of course, the Mormon-bashers looking for anti-Mormon material to support their own bigotry and ignorancewill not find this any help, and will check off that portion of the review.

Rather than that, I refer you to the \\"Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies\\" (FARMS) review. Simply run \\"The Refiner's Fire\\" in their \\"search\\" box and read the list of reviews of this incredibly WRONG book.  I'll give just a few examples of the ignorance:    The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants contain several explicit condemnations of sorcery, witchcraft, and magic. While admitting that there are only \\"rare references to magic or witchcraft in the Book of Mormon\\" (p. 176, 177), Brooke nonetheless insists that the \\"categories of treasure, magic, and sorcery . . . fascinated Joseph Smith\\" (p. 168). The Book of Mormon maintains that Christ will \\"cut off witchcrafts out of thy land\\" (3 Nephi 21:16), and sorcery, witchcraft, and \\"the magic art\\" are mentioned in lists of sins (Alma 1:32, Mormon 2:10). \\"Sorceries, and witchcrafts, and magics\\" are also attributed to \\"the power of the evil one\\" (Mormon 1:19). In the Doctrine and Covenants, sorcerers are among those who are \\"cast down to hell\\" (D&C 76:103, 106), who \\"shall have their part in . . . the second death\\" (D&C 63:17).37 These are the only references to magical or occult powers in LDS scripture, and they are uniformly and emphatically negative. Brooke's key terms, such as \\"alchemy,\\" \\"astrology,\\" \\"hermeticism,\\" \\"androgyny,\\" and \\"cabala,\\" are never mentioned in LDS scripture.    Even careful readers of the Book of Mormon will appreciate the previously unrecognized \\"insights\\" Brooke brings to the text. For example, Asael Smith's writings on Daniel 2 (rather than the book of Daniel itself) are said to have \\"anticipated [the language] of the Book of Mormon\\" (p. 78). This unfortunately disregards the uncongenial fact that Nebuchadnezzer's dream is nowhere alluded to in the book.62 Brooke teaches us several new things about the prophet Mormon, too: His erroneous notion that the \\"lone Nephite survivor [was] Mormon\\" (p. 159) is, for instance, employed as evidence for the equally false assertion that \\"the [golden] plates were hidden by the hero Mormon for Joseph Smith to recover\\" (p. 156).63    Brooke insists on arguing for Masonic influence on Joseph during the writing of the Book of Mormon, nearly fifteen years before he became a Mason    While it is quite true that Rigdon became a Mason, he became such in the 1840s, a bit late to have passed any esoteric lore on to Joseph in the 1830s.89 Professor Brooke also notes that a John Rigdon and a Thomas Rigdon were Masons in 1829, but fails to demonstrate that these Rigdons had any relationship, beyond name, to Sidney. And Brooke indulges in another ante hoc fallacy by claiming that the Mormon temple ceremony could have been influenced at its origin by \\"the European Lodges of Adoption\\" (p. 250), despite the fact that \\"the Rite of Adoption . . . has never been introduced into America    The book is fatally wounded by its methodological leaps, by factual errors far beyond those we have been able to indicate here, by the forcing of evidence, and by its often remarkable misreading of texts. Its publication does no credit to Professor Brooke, to Cambridge University Press, or, for that matter, to the scholars who endorse it on its jacket cover. If the Mormon History Association still awards its prize for the worst book of the year, we enthusiastically nominate The Refiner's Fire as the best candidate in quite some time.    Before you Mormon bashers check \\"NO\\" this review was not helpful to you, go to FARMS and read all the errors in this book. It is a travesty of ignorant \\"scholarship\\", and is very easly proven so. Those that have already marked \\"NO\\" and given it superlatives in their review demonstrate an enormous ignorance of true Mormon, thought, history, and doctrine.	2004-12-25

In order to understand the full complications of the story, one would have to understand that the problem was not Galileo against the Bible, but Galileo against Hellenized Christianity-- Aristotle and Plato; the creeds of the church fathers, i.e. the Apologists, etc.; in other words orthodox Christianity which had come under the domination of Greek Philosophy.  What Galileo was arguing against was NOT in the Bible, it was Catholic Church doctrine mixed with Greek Philosophy (the metaphysics of Aristotle and Plato) which is still prevalent in some fundamentalist Protestant sects. <br /> <br />I fully understand that this is a children's book, and even some adults would disagree with my review.  This is due to ignorance of Church history and doctrine, not to mention bias and prejudice.  Therefore, I am only writing this to encourage older readers to look more deeply into the situation between Galileo and the Church.  Although I am not a Catholic, and definitely not a Catholic apologist, the Church is usually portrayed in a worse case scenario than they deserve.  Always remember that the Church at that time was also the secular judge and jury, and that they tried very hard to work with Galileo, who, at times, was kind of a behavior problem. <br /> <br />Before you have a knee-jerk reaction and say this review did not help you, remember that educated people will read this, and you could end up looking very ignorant.  Do your homework first.  All is not like you've always heard about Galileo. Atheists and agnostics love to put their own spin on things.  Just ask the Boy Scouts of America. <br />	2004-12-14

So the Jesus of whom they are speaking must be the Biblical Jesus.  <br /> <br />Response:  Yes, the real Jesus, not the Jesus of the Patristic Fathers, the many councils of the Catholic Church, or the Nicene Creed nonsensical imagination of those bishops and leaders of the Church under threat of death or exile if they did not agree.  The real Jesus is much closer to the 1800 bishops who signed a statement shortly after the Nicene Council that the Nicene Creed did not reflect their views. <br /> <br />Critic: The first paragraph of the \\"Introduction\\" to the Book of Mormon reads:  <br />\\"The Book of Mormon is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible. It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fullness of the everlasting gospel.\\"  <br />Here we see the Book of Mormon being 'linked' to the Bible, therefore, our assumption that they mean another testament - besides the Bible, is obviously correct. [As an aside: notice the above introduction says the Bible also contains 'the fullness of the everlasting gospel'. The Mormon Church teaches that parts of the Bible are missing, and that which remains is largely corrupted. Since that is what they believe, why does the Book of Mormon introduction say otherwise?] <br />  <br />Response:  This critic needs to do a little thinking.  The introduction he is talking about says the Bible \\"CONTAINS\\" the fullness of the Gospel.  Mormons believe the Bible insofar as it is correctly translated.  Has anyone ever counted the huge number of translations of the Bible? The Bible was written by men, edited by men, translated by men, interpreted by men, and \\"canonized\\" by men.  Need I say more? <br /> <br />Critic: Imagine you wrote a biography of Elvis Presley and it became world famous; a standard reference work for anyone wanting to study the life of \\"The King.\\" Then, years later, I wrote another biography of Elvis Presley - However! The Elvis Presley of whom I wrote was not the famous singer but somebody quite different who just happened to have the same name. Now, if I put on the front cover of my book:  <br />\\"Another biography of Elvis Presley.\\"  <br />I would be giving a false impression. Because those words would suggest I was speaking about the same Elvis Presley as you, since I claim it is 'another' (a second) biography.  <br /> <br />Response:  Excellent point.  That's exactly what the early church fathers did.  The Catholic Church, and its spin-offs, the Protestant sects, took the Jesus in the New Testament, along with a lot of Greek philosophy, and made up their own Jesus after many councils and systematizations. It took Augustine 15 years to systematize the Nicene Creed into the Trinity only a few fundamentalists believe in today.  This was excellent.  I must hand it to this critic (I would use his/her name, but, of course, he/she was too embarrassed to use their name.) he/she described perfectly why the Church of LDS doesn't accept the Jesus the \\"Christians\\" re-wrote the book on.  The LDS Church only accepts what's in the Bible, not the doctrines of men. <br />A different Jesus?  <br />For many years Christians have claimed that the Jesus of the Mormon Church is a different Jesus than He of whom the Bible speaks. This claim has been denied by LDS Church leaders who have insisted they worship the same Jesus. The Jesus of the Bible.  <br />Hinckley's admission:  <br />On June 4, 1998 whilst on a visit to Paris, France. President Hinckley bore his testimony of Jesus Christ. While doing so Hinckley spoke of those outside the church who claim Mormons do not believe in the traditional Christ, he continued:  <br />\\"No, I don't. The traditional Christ of whom they speak is not the Christ of whom I speak. For the Christ of whom I speak has been revealed in the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times. He, together with his Father, appeared to the boy Joseph Smith in the year 1820, and when Joseph left the grove that day, he knew more about the nature of God than all the learned ministers of the gospel of the ages.\\" Church News. Week ending June 20, 1998  <br />Throughout the centuries Christians have believed in the Jesus Christ who is presented to us in the Bible. He who was, and is: \\"...God ... manifest in the flesh, ... preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.\\" (1 Timothy 3:16)  <br />The \\"traditional Christ\\" who is rejected by Mormonism.  <br />Hinckley is not the first to reveal Mormonism's rejection of the real Lord Jesus Christ.  <br />At the 147th General Conference Barnard P. Brockbank stated:  <br />\\"...the Christ followed by the Mormons is not the Christ followed by traditional Christianity.\\"  <br />\\"It is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\\"  <br />If the Christ of the Book of Mormon is the Christ in whom Mormons believe then, clearly, he is a different Christ from the Jesus Christ of the Bible, in whom Mormons don't believe.  <br />Therefore, the Book of Mormon cannot be:  <br />\\"Another testament of Jesus Christ.\\"  <br />but rather, it is:  <br />\\"A Testament of another Jesus Christ.\\" <br /> <br />Response: Yes, it is.  It definitely is.  LDS don't believe in the medieval, metaphysical re-invention of Christ that took place at the Nicene Council.  The Book of Mormon is definitely NOT a testament of the Jesus/God imagination of the Nicene fundamentalists.  The BOM is a Testament of the Jesus of the New Testament because the Catholic/Protestant metaphysical Nicene Jesus is unrecognizable. <br /> <br />Critic: And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. (Matthew 24:4-5) <br /> Response: Exactly correct. Since Constantine re-invented the Catholic Church, they and the Protestants have created a second Christ that most people don't recognize from the Jesus described in the New Testament. The Jesus they have \\"created\\" does not deceive the LDS <br />But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. (Galatians 1:8-9) <br /> <br />Response: Excellent point again. This is exactly why the LDS don't accept the metaphysical beliefs of the Catholic Church, and their Protestant offspring sects. So much has been added to the New Testament by the early fathers and subsequent Church leaders, and has been adopted by Protestant sects, that the LDS Church has gone directly to the New Testament for their concept and belief in Jesus and his teachings.  It is quite odd that the Protestants who broke away from the Catholic Church-in part-vehemently defend Catholic doctrine, but denounce the Catholic Church, as they do anyone who doesn't agree with them.  LDS doctrine on Jesus is taken straight from the New Testament, not from man-made doctrine as is the case with the Catholics and Protestant sects. <br /> <br />I recommend the critics of the LDS view of Jesus read the two following books available here on Amazon. <br />\\"HowGreek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God\\" <br />\\"The Father is Not the Son\\" <br />I paraphrase from \\"The Father Is Not the Son\\":  <br />We do not find anything like the doctrine of the Trinity in its developed form in the New Testament. If the Trinitarian doctrines cannot be found in the Bible, then Jesus Christ and his apostles did not teach those doctrines.  If Jesus and his apostles did not teach them, then belief in such a doctrine is not mandatory for salvation. If Trinitarian doctrines are not mandatory for salvation, then they cannot be used as a litmus test for membership in the Christian community. <br />	2004-11-27

Rather than go into a long explanation here, I refer interested readers to the book, available on Amazon, \\"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God.\\"  If Amazon is out of this book, Cedar Fort will have a new publication in a couple of weeks.  Much of the information is similar, but the conclusions are much different, in many cases.

Robinson, ISBN 088494784X, and available here on Amazon.  But I quickly changed my mind because the type of bigoted, intolerant, uninformed people who bash other people's religion wouldn't read it, let alone purchase it.  I hope I'm wrong.  I hope you will purchase it, and read it with an open mind.  However, I will quote or paraphrase some points in the book for those who will at least read this much to see how wrong this \\"cult\\" book is.<br /><br />The following are a few points from the book \\"Are Mormons Christians?\\" They are counter points to just a few of one critic's ten characteristics of cults:<br /><br />There are no objective criteria for distinguishing cults from religions.  By checking synonym finders, dictionaries, and thesauri one can quickly see that the terms \\"cult\\", \\"sect\\", \\"denomination\\", and \\"religion\\" are synonymous; completely interchangeable.<br /><br />The term \\"cult\\" does not describe what a religion is; only that it is regarded as \\"a religion that I don't like.\\"  Any objective definition of \\"cult\\" applied to any sect can also be applied to the Christian church of the New Testament and to most of today's mainline denominations when they were in their infancy.  The Jews were just as incensed at the Christian's additions to God's word in the period of the early Church as anti-Mormon critics are at the Book of Mormon (and others) today.  From the viewpoint of the Jews and Romans both the movement of John the Baptist and that of Jesus were \\"cults\\".<br /><br />\\"Cults\\" have been accused of having a system of doctrine and practice which is in some state of flux.  Christianity has, of course, held many councils to determine or to clarify its doctrines and policies, from the Council of Nicaea to the Second Vatican Council.  All of these councils settled questions neither asked nor answered in the Bible.  Many sectsof the Protestant persuasion have argued for centuries over these points of doctrines.  This is one way, along with persecution of those who disagree with whichever sect is in power, that we get all the Protestant sects.<br /><br />Now, before you \\"Christian\\" intolerants check \\"no\\", this review wasn't helpful to you, stop and think.  It is either helpful to you for a better understanding of name-calling used by bigots, or you are stating that you think dictionary definitions and historical facts are wrong.  If you still check \\"No\\", then please leave a review stating that you have read the book and why you think it is wrong, and what evidence you have that makes you think it's wrong, and why you think it's OK to call other people names just because they think differently.  Please, don't \\"review\\" the book \\"Are Mormons Christians\\" without reading it, or mark \\"No\\", it wasn't helpful without seriously considering what kind of person that makes you out to be.  And please don't do as so many religious bigots do and not give your name.  That says something about you also.	2004-11-23

If there is anything we have learned from that election it's that you can't trust or believe one word written in many of the major newspapers in America.  Newspapers including the L.A. Times, New York Times, and the Washington Post, which barely qualifies as a newspaper, and many others made absolutely no attempt to be honest, fair, objective, or newsworthy.  They ran a campaign for Kerry in the name of a newspaper, with an unending, unrelenting series of negative \\"news reports\\", writing articles on anything and everything they could find to show whatever they thought would undermine the Republican candidate. <br />Some committed left-wingers like the reviewer Carmen J. Lopez, \\"Couldn't be more off\\", October 27, 2004, demonstrate the same kind of dishonesty that exists in the press. No one could have lived through that election without seeing the glaringly obvious anti-Bush rhetoric.  It's no wonder there is such a rift in our society; people can't even be honest when the proof is in black and white. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-15

Perhaps I will deal with the author's lies, distortions, half-truths, and twisting of LDS doctrine when I have more time. For now,I will just mention that I have come to realize from private correspondence with him, that this is not a person concerned about anyone's \\"salvation\\".  He hates the Church, and, like a college freshman who has just learned about evolution, he is using \\"science\\" as the basis for his hatred.  Please read the official statement from the Church about evolution.  His lies about the Church's stand on evolution are best discounted from this statement.  It is just one example of his many lies:    Encyclopedia of Mormonism Article on Evolution  Evolution  The position of the Church on the origin of man was published by the First Presidency in 1909 and stated again by a different First Presidency in 1925:     The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, basing its belief on divine revelation, ancient and modern, declares man to be the direct and lineal offspring of Deity. . . . Man is the child of God, formed in the divine image and endowed with divine attributes (see Appendix, \\"Doctrinal Expositions of the First Presidency\\").   The scriptures tell why man was created, but they do not tell how, though the Lord has promised that he will tell that when he comes again (D&C 101:32-33). In 1931, when there was intense discussion on the issue of organic evolution, the First Presidency of the Church, then consisting of Presidents Heber J. Grant, Anthony W. Ivins, and Charles W. Nibley, addressed all of the General Authorities of the Church on the matter, and concluded,     Upon the fundamental doctrines of the Church we are all agreed. Our mission is to bear the message of the restored gospel to the world. Leave geology, biology, archaeology, and anthropology, no one of which has to do with the salvation of the souls of mankind, to scientific research, while we magnify our calling in the realm of the Church. . .   Upon one thing we should all be able to agree, namely, that Presidents Joseph F. Smith, John R. Winder, and Anthon H. Lund were right when they said: \\"Adam is the primal parent of our race\\" [First Presidency Minutes, Apr. 7, 1931]. WILLIAM E. EVENSON     Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Vol.2, EVOLUTION     People within the Church may have their own personal opinions, but that has nothing to do with Church doctrine.    In addition to his twist on evolution, Anderson has taken quotes from personal opinions and used them as Church doctrine.  Most of the books and articles Anderson gets his quotes from tell us in the front of the book that what is in the book is NOT official Church doctrine, or is not an official publication of the Church, and is the author's personal opinion/belief.    I fully realize that people looking for these kinds of books are looking for \\"ammunition\\" to \\"shoot down the Church\\", and will not find this \\"review\\" helpful.  They are being as dishonest as Anderson.  If an official statement of the Church is not helpful in understanding the Church's stand on evolution, and Andersons's lies, then go ahead and believe Anderson; that is why they read his kind of books.	2004-11-12

I'm not even going to try to explain why because it would take up too much space.  For starters, read the following books: <br />How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God - 0882906070 <br />The Father Is Not the Son - 1890828076 <br /> <br />The \\"Nicene Trinity\\" is a figment of medieval imagination.  This is historical fact, and the proof is found throughout medieval and world history books and texts.  It's really too well-known to even argue about it, so I won't.  Just read the books. <br /> <br />The author says something about the Trinity no longer being considered obtuse, secondary, and impractical dogma.  NOTHING could be farther from the truth.  Very few Protestant sects believe the Trinity exactly as the medieval bishops were forced to agree to. Even in those days, 1800 bishops signed a statement saying that they did not agree with the Nicene Trinity.  Today, mainly Catholic, and some Protestant sects accept this weakest of Christian doctrines.  The irony is that this doctrine has possibly caused more murder, torture, and mayhem than any other doctrine in any other religion, except Islam.  For nearly two thousand years \\"Christians\\" have slaughtered people in the name of the Trinity. <br /> <br />I paraphrase from \\"The Father Is Not the Son\\":  <br />We do not find anything like the doctrine of the Trinity in its developed form in the New Testament. If the Trinitarian doctrines cannot be found in the Bible, then Jesus Christ and his apostles did not teach those doctrines.  If Jesus and his apostles did not teach them, then belief in such a doctrine is not mandatory for salvation. If Trinitarian doctrines are not mandatory for salvation, then they cannot be used as a litmus test for membership in the Christian community. <br /> <br />The Trinity is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; numerically three persons.  One in purpose. So, stop the persecution, the bigotry, the intolerance, the hate, and the arguing, and try to act like Christians.  <br />	2004-11-09

I feel I know enough about what he is saying in this book to have an opinion. <br />Where I may disagree with Joe is on the national debt.  We live in strange and fearful times. 911 sent us reeling into a recession that was already put in place  by the end of the Clinton administration. The war on terrorism could lead us into something close to bankruptcy if we don't prosecute it better and faster, and stop giving these terrorists places to safely hide.  This is skyrocketing the cost of the war.  The longer the war takes, the larger are national debt will become. <br /> <br />But, what do we do?  The war on terrorism must be fought, although much better than we're doing it now.  John Kerry would only make this war worse, and he would probably cut and run. That would save some money, but what would it cost us in the long run? <br /> <br />The national debt is a big problem, but I think we need to give congress a little slack on this.

I almost threw up when I read the \\"review\\", Dobson is an AMERICAN TALIBAN, August 24, 2004  <br />Reviewer:    R. Blazak \\"Sociologist\\"   <br />His is exactly the philosophy that got us into the mess we are in---Don't discipline your child, you may hurt their self esteem. <br /> <br />I went to college and became a teacher in the 1960s.  During my career I worked with the results of Blazak's philosophy: question your superiors; get all the gusto you can get because you only live once; reward the positive, don't punish the negative; ignore bad behavior, reinforce the good; give warm \\"fuzzy wuzzies\\", not punishment; don't play competitive games, or use competition in the classroom, it builds aggression among some, and hurts the self esteem of others.  <br />Then there were, believe it or not, special classes that let minors smoke in the classroom, and liberal professors and some teachers advocating making condoms available to school children. <br /> <br />We can thank these \\"liberal\\" sociologists, psychologists, professors, and teachers for the mess we are in today.  Discipline has become a dirty word. Challenging teachers in the classroom has become the norm. Parents teaching children their \\"rights\\", and demanding that teachers not discipline their children is all too common.  Parents refusing to let teachers keep their misbehaving and/or failing students after school, or not allowing them to come to Saturday school, then blaming the teachers for their child's failure. <br /> <br />I have several of Dr. Dobson's books.  This is the kind of discipline and training we've abandoned in this country.  If you like smart alec, uncooperative, reluctant, and sometimes dangerous students, then you'll love Blazak's alternative style to Dr. Dobson.  <br /> <br />Our society is a result of people like Blazak who forced the rules and laws of society upon a questioning academic community. It wasn't conservatives like Dr. Dobsom.  I know I watched it happen. Millions of older, probably retired, teachers will also attest to that. To make matters worse, young teachers have been taught this garbage and many of them live by the liberal philosophy, perpetuating the problem.  Now schools are wondering how to handle these children of society's creation. <br /> <br />My advice is to read Dr. Dobson.  Forget the religious part,if you wish, but use your common sense.  Discipline is needed in every walk of life--athletics, music, academics,military, and much more.  So, where is this discipline going to be taught, if not in the home? <br /> <br />Today's parents dump their children off at school, and expect us to feed them, wipe their nose, check their eyes, keep them safe, and, if we have time, teach.  Then they blame the schools for all the behavior problems,academic problems, and societal problems that result from them handing over their responsibilites to other entities, and too often without support. I once had a parent tell me it was our job as teachers to teach the child how to behave--without discipline, of course. <br /> <br />This is the new American way; let the children run wild, express their worst feelings so we don't hurt their self esteem, then blame the bad results on society.  Of course it's society's fault because we listened to liberals like Balzak for several decades, and look where it's got us. He would say we didn't intend that.  Well, maybe not, but that's where you got us. <br /> <br />Just read the book and decide for yourself.	2004-10-15

I would like to see a revised edition with a better subject index and a glossary of Bible, theology, and philosophy words used in this book.  It is NOT an easy read for those with a light background in these subject areas. I think a more succinct version for those who don't care to indulge in 450 pages of \\"heavy\\" theological and Greek metaphysical history would also be appreciated by a wider audience.  This is all that keeps it from being a five-star book. For those with the background and the dedicated interest, it is a very wonderful book. <br />The author clearly demonstrates why the so-called \\"orthodox\\" churches of today,who think they believe in the Bible, and only the Bible, do not.  Within less than two hundred years after the death of Christ the apostasy began. The teachings of Christ became an admixture of Judaism, Greek and Oriental philosophy, and other philosophical beliefs that eventually became evident in the fourth century with the Arian controversy and the doctrine of the Trinity. <br />As the author, Richard Hopkins, says, \\"To understand the Bible it is necessary to think like an ancient Hebrew, not like an ancient Greek\\",......the natural tendency of the Greeks was to view the figurative language of the Jews in a metaphysical light. \\"It is the transition from a figurative interpretation of literal facts to a metaphysical interpretation of those facts that most clearly marks the theological apostasy...\\" <br />Taking the doctrine of the Trinity as an example, in the Bible Jesus says, \\"...the Father and I are one.\\"  This was the Jews figurative language.  They meant they are one in purpose, etc.  But, for the Greeks, who interpreted everything metaphysically, what Jesus said took on a whole other meaning. The Greeks interpreted all passages in the Bible allegorically to suit their pet theories, and they had a bunch.  \\"....reserving the purity of Gospel truths from the metaphysical assumptions of Hellenistic thought was essentially impossible.\\" The Jews could not have thought up the Trinity \\"....because that notion is metaphysical and the Jews had no concept of metaphysics.\\" <br />Contrary to Elaine Pagels, and others, the Gnostic \\"gospels\\" are not new, not lost, not Chrisitian, and not deserving of being canonized. Most Gnostic teaching were heretical, and some were downright foolish.  This book explains that thoroughly. <br />As I said, it is a wonderful read, but have your collegiate, philosophy, and Bible and theology dictionaries handy if you do not have a good biblical and philosophy background. Although everything is explained--sooner or later--the dictionaries will speed up your reading. <br />It should have been five stars.  The content was, but the rest wasn't.  Do read this book, especially if you wonder where so much of today's \\"orthodox\\" teachings come from. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-25

Beckwith is a long-time Mormon-basher who has been shown to be so wrong it's a wonder he has the audacity to keep writing.  He was taken apart and handed his errors in the book \\"How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God.\\"  That's why he's come up with this book.  He knows scholarly LDS writers are more than he can stand up to.    There is not enough space here to illustrate the errors of the classical theist and their mixture of Judaism, Greek and Oriental philosophy, and paganism.  Instead I will recommend two books:  1. How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God.  2. The Father is Not the Son.    The first book especially knocks Beckwith out of the argument over the Trinity. Very few people accept the classical theists view of the Trinity, which was a figment of man's imagination during the Middle Ages.  These books easily prove the errors of the classical theist.  Even if one is so stubborn as to hang on to the metaphysical beliefs of the classical theist, it would be good to know the other side, if just for the knowledge in talking with more enlightened thinkers. One example: The ancient Jews had no concept of metaphysics. As the Jewish Reviewer: Seth J. Frantzman (Jerusalem, Israel)has said here,\\"..just Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and circumcision\\". However, before he accuses Mormons of being viscious, he needs to look at the thousands of years of Hebrew wars and slaughtering that is throughout the Pentatuch. Where does he find that in LDS history? Oh, yeah, the Mountain Meadows Massacre, but that was by renegade Mormons, not the Church. The rest of the Mormons didn't even know what happened until they were told about it.    The Jews were realists and meant what they said even when figuratively speaking.  The Greeks dealt with just about everything using metaphysics, the more abstruse the better, it seems.  The scriptures were revealed to the Jews, not the Greeks.  Why, then, did metaphysics--i.e. the Trinity, incorporeality of God, incomprehensibility of God, etc.--creep into Christian doctrine?  These books will explain that.      Good, faithful Christians truly think they believe the Bible only.  Unfortunately, they do not realize the errors of their doctrines due to the metaphysics that crept in during the years of the apostasy after the original apostles died.  However, people like Beckwith should know this. But, then, what would they write on to make money from books?  How about the truth?    As you read this you will notice the \\"reviewers\\" who have read my review here will say this review was not helpful to them.  Of course it isn't.  When you are looking for \\"literature\\" to help you criticize and blaspheme other religions, you are not going to get much help from this review. Your mind is already made up,and it is certainly not open to any other idea.  This is also proof that they did not read the books recommended in my review here.  I challenge those that got \\"no help\\" (because they didn't want help (They were looking for \\"ammunition\\" to \\"shoot down\\" the Mormons) from this review to read those books, then come back and tell me where they are wrong and how they can support the metaphysics in \\"orthodox Christianity\\"	2004-09-23

Trinitarian doctrines cannot be found in the New Testament. If the Trinitarian doctrines cannot be found in the Bible, then Jesus Christ and his apostles did not teach those doctrines. If Jesus Christ and his apostles did not teach them, then belief in them is not mandatory for salvation. If Trinitarian doctrines are not mandatory for salvation, then they cannot be used to judge if one person, or church, belongs in the Christian community. And yet both Catholics and Protestants have persecuted, executed, tortured, and burned supposed \\"heretics\\" who do not believe in the doctrine of the Trinity.  This is the major issue and the biggest reason for all the persecution these churches have visited upon those who think differently for two thousand years. <br /> <br />The teachings of the Fathers do establish that the teachings of the Catholic Church are very old, but they also establish that those doctrines have been changed many times since the time of Christ. Although Protestant churches do not venerate the teachings of the Fathers, they do accept the definitions of the Trinity, which these fathers formulated. So, there we have it; the Protestants referring to the writings of the Fathers of the Church they despise, and also write against. <br /> <br />Now, here's the ugly part of what this doctrine has caused Protestants to do: For two thousand years any Christian who dared to question this doctrine has been persecuted. As one pamphlet entitled \\"The Trail of Blood\\", published by an honest Baptist Church, has said, \\"Rivers of blood\\" have been shed over this doctrine.  But neither force nor ridicule can establish the validity of an idea. <br />	2004-09-21

Let's start with this one: <br />The sordid 1980s scandals of Pentecostal ministers Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart will incline some to presume that Paul Crouch, president of Pentecostal-linked television network TBN, did engage in the alleged homosexual liaison. <br /> <br />But whether the allegations in this case are eventually substantiated or not, the question arises again: why does the Pentecostal ministry seem particularly susceptible to sexual scandal? <br /> <br />It may turn out, in fact, that statistically, Pentecostal ministers fall in this way no more often than do other ministers. I'm sure we make this connection at least partly because of the long cultural shadows of Bakker and Swaggart. <br /> <br />Yes, it's a pretty \\"sick\\" thing to do.  I just thought I would show you how bad it would be if the Mormons behaved like the Protestant whackos. (I am NOT calling Protestants \\"whackos\\". I am calling the anti-Mormon leaders who dedicate their life's work to attacking Mormons \\"whackos\\")  I just wanted to illustrate how bad it could get if Mormons behaved in the same way.  The kind of garbage (which I didn't write) that I've posted here is  just an illustration.	2004-09-18

They started attacking Bush personally three months before Bush started campaigning.  They dish it out in volumes, but the Swift Boat vets, including doctors and academy graduates present overwhelming proof that Kerry is a liar, and they whine and beg the President whom they chastise, curse, and accuse of being a traitor, to stop the accusations.  John Kerry and company make up the foulest presidential campaigners in the history of this country, in my opinon.  The good thing is the voters aren't fooled.  They have finally awakened to the fact that Kerry has built his entire career (a useless one as a senator who does nothing) on a pack of lies.  The polls are killing him now that the good Americans of this country finally know who he and his pack of rats really are.	2004-09-15

I read this book many years ago as an assignment for a college philosophy class.  I have to admit that at 19 years old,not having any interest in philosophy, Eastern history, or biblical studies, I found it a tough go. Now, years later, after finding an interest in those subjects the ideas of the philosphers become clearer to me with each passing year.<br /><br />I wish I could say the same for \\"A reader (Schaumburg, IL USA)\\"  His review is just a bunch of esoteric bovine scatology.  Nothing is harder to grasp than Eastern philosopy, even for Orientals, in most cases.  It is often said that the Hindus don't understand Hinduism themselves.  It's not a religion, maybe not a philosophy, and probably just a guide to good living, along the lines of Confucious.<br /><br />Without belaboring religious studies, it has to be mentioned that Judaism is probably the oldest of the philosophies/religions/traditions, and before that Zoroastrianism.  However, Plato also dealt with many of the issues in these studies, especially the ideas of creation, which he may have gotten from Judasim, and is very similar to Mormon theology on this point.  Of course, Israel and Greece are supposedly Asian, but that's stretching the term Asian to cover pretty wide territory.  Point being, that from the Bible to Hinduism, Eastern philosophy is no easier to read and understand than Kant, unless you take into account that Kant comes along a lot later and has a lot more to base his writings on.<br /><br />Bottom line: Kant is no harder to read than the Upanishads. I believe it is must reading for anyone interested in following the development of \\"Western\\" philosophy,which,in many cases is just modern Eastern philosophy. Depending on how you look at it, of course.	2004-09-14

There will be nothing but politically biased \\"reviews\\" on this book.  People like G. J Jakaitis \\"philoman, below, will refuse to believe a word of it, just because they don't want to.  I have followed every interview of those mentioned in this book that I could find.  Unfortunately, the newspapers-turned-propaganda literature, like the L.A. and N.Y. Times, will not give it due mention, and the horrendously biased network news stations will not interview anyone involved in writing this book, or is written about in this book.  Ask yourself why you don't see more of these people interview on TV or radio, other than on conservative talk shows.  Ask yourself why  liars like Richard Clarke are given much press coverage, but not the authors of this book.  Then ask yourself why John Kerry only spent four months in Vietnam.  Then ask yourself how he could earn all those Purple Hearts and never stay in a hospital, or have any scars or medical records to support his claims.  Why would high-ranking military officers, including doctors, lie about this? Why will people like G. J Jakaitis \\"philoman not believe this?  The truth is that they do believe it.  They are not so stupid as to overlook the overwhelming evidence, and the reputable testimonies to the facts.  However, these people hate Bush and America so much they would support Charles Manson, lies and all, to defeat Bush. Why will Kerry not release records?  A careful search of those military records will reveal the truth, and Kerry does not want that.  John Kerry has \\"engineered\\" his entire career to smearing America with horrendous accusations, lies, and exaggerations of incidents in Vietnam and elsewhere.  His one objective is to become President, at any cost.  Why is it that the socialist countries and countries that sponsor terrorism want John Kerry to win the election? Think, people, think. Those countries are afraid of Bush, but they know John Kerry is a weakling.  They are not afraid of John Kerry.  Read this book and you will know why.  John Kerry has been anti-American his whole life. Don't believe the \\"reviews\\" against this book.  They are politically motivated.  Is this review politically motivated? You bet it is, but it is honest.  I will do all I can to keep John Kerry from turning this country into a weak, second-rate, socialist country.  But anything I will say or do will be my honest attempt to support the truth, and combat terrorism, radical Islam, and members of the radical left in the Democratic party.  My uncles fought, and one was seriously wounded, in WWII to prevent the enemy from turning this country into the type of government the radical left in this country would have, once in power.  I will not let one disgustingly anti-American liar get into the White House without a fight.  Read this book.  It is the truth.  I have researched it for months through many sources.	2004-08-15

I got as far as the review by Levent Basturk (Aurora, Colorado United States), and I became enraged by the ignorance.     First, I have to say that I have some very nice Muslim acquaintances. BUT, why is it that Muslims use the Crusades as one of their reasons for hating the West, and self-deprecating, crazed liberals go right along with it like the ignorant fools they are. Muslims invaded and terrorized as far as they could take their armies from the very beginning of the religion. They invaded Europe about 300 years before the first Crusade. Today, after cursing the West for invading the Holy Land, which they had no business occupying, they brag about how well Christians were treated in Spain while they occupied it, and liberals say, \\"Yes, the Crusades were horrible. How can we live with such a history\\", or something like that. Disgusting. Get it straight, people, Islam is dedicated to converting the entire planet to their religion. Their history is replete with evidence of their attempts to do just that. Make no mistake about it, Islam fully intends to take back Spain, then the rest of Europe. The cowardly Spanish and French will pay an enormous price for capitulating to the Muslims.     Even 50 years from now Europe will not be anything like it is today if Europeans don't wake up to the threat. The only reason Europe isn't under Muslim rule today is that they were stopped by Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732. Did that date get your attention, people? 732 is well over 300 years before the first Crusade, and the Muslims had already invaded Spain and built a civilzation there before this time--an Islamic culture. What is it the liberal \\"thinkers\\" don't understand about this.     The terrorists today are just following through with their ancestor's plans for total world conversion to Islam. Even though there are some very fine Muslim people, their leaders aren't so nice, and they have millions of radical followers. The war against terrorism isn't just over oil folks. It's over religion, land, and world dominance. It's time to wake up, people, before it's too late. This is World War III, and if the radical Muslims win, you will lose forever.	2004-08-02

Combine this with his cheap shot at President Bush, which is also unproven, and you have another work of fiction writing about fiction. <br /> I'm surprised Burstein didn't gather together all his liberal and leftist whackos to write a review on Little Red Riding Hood. <br /> Burstein would have been a lot better off reading some of the other books on DVC before indulging in this escapade. Of course, that would not have been timely enough to cash in on the craze, would it? <br /> Most of the historical incidents Dan Brown talks about are myths or gross exaggerations based on incidents of much less historicity than he &quot;explains&quot;. <br /> Only radical feminists would overlook the fact that the Bible and Christian teachings are full of heroic stories of women, and that Jesus may really be the first &quot;feminist.&quot; <br /> Only an uneduated fool would believe the Catholic church murdered millions of women. I'm sorry, but you folks who bought that lie shouldn't have slept through history classes. Time to get out the history books and brush up a little on reality. Then, after you do a little homework, read some of the other books on DVC that clearly point out the errors in DVC. After you do that, check around a little. There are some people in some religions that also believe Jesus and Mary might possibly have been married. But I doubt any of them believe they started a new blood line of royalty. <br /> Oh, yeah, and who cares what Leonardo portrayed in his art? Since when was he an authority on the life of Christ. He hated the church, which should tell you a little bit about his lifestyle. <br /> Now, get on with the search for better books on DVC. You might be surprised, and really learn something.

I am always amazed that the America-haters of the loony left in the Democratic party have brainwashed ignorant sheep of people into hating their own country; the country that has provided them with so much, and to which they give so little.  [...]  Sunni, Shiite, Iranian, Syrian, and many others, who in the past, have killed each other by the thousands.  Yes, it's true Mr. Stokes, and other American \\"Nazis\\" of the left, enemies of this country are working together whether they hate each other or not.  Some of their objectives are 1. Destroy America  2. Take back Spain, which they invaded and conquered a few hundred years before the Crusades.  Which of course, most ignorant Americans who slept and griped through world history classes don't remember, or probably don't even know, and 3. Take over France.  Yes, people, that is a goal of the Muslim terrorists.  The French will pay a big price for protecting the terrorists and turning against America who saved them in WWII. They are one of the next on the list.  There is a world of evidence that terrorists were being harbored in Iraq.  Not only evidence, but facts so clear that we know some of their names.  Yes, the Bush administration wanted to destroy Sadaam's rule.  Why wouldn't they?  They killed their own people, invaded Kuwait, tried to assasinate an American President, and have been, for years, a menace to their neighboring countries.  Even Putin of Russia has said Iraq had plans to attack us.  I am assuming, and I know I shouldn't, but I won't be far wrong, that the leftists writing \\"reviews\\" of this book that they didn't read, are undereducated, ignorant, and not too bright members of the X and Y generation---the most spoiled generation in American history, and the richest.  Why these young people hate the country that has made them the richest generation in history is beyond me, but they do.  Well, I guess I do know why; the leftists that have taken over the Democratic party have brainwashed them into thinking that they are going to be given even more than they already have.  That worked in Germany---for a while.  That worked in Russia--for a while.  And it has worked in third world countries all over the world--for a while.  But, socialist countries don't keep powerful, rich, and successful very long.  Just ask the Germans, the Russians, and a lot of Latin Americans, such as the Cubans. Yes, the miserable failure Latin Americans like Che Guevara, who failed in nearly everything he attempted, except when under Castro's leadership, is a perfect example of the \\"champions\\" these leftist idiots worship.  \\"Che lives\\", they chant.  Well, not for very long he didn't, and doesn't now--because he was a loser.  It's laughable how the leftists in the older generation want to bring back the sixties, and all the hate they fomented against wonderful American soldiers, whom they weren't fit to shine their shoes.  They wave banners and signs, chant, sing anti-war songs, then get into the cars, busses, and planes, and burn the oil they \\"don't need\\" to go to their nice homes this country allowed them to earn, where they get on the internet and write \\"reviews\\" of books they haven't read.

Many of the positive reviews, including the ex-Mormon's, show an incredible lack of education in Church and world history.<br /><br />This is a small portion of the review of this nonsense from FAIR (Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research.  The entire review can be read at the FAIR website.<br /><br />\\"Like nearly all other anti-Mormons, McKeever and Johnson constantly attempt to force their own version of LDS doctrine on their readers rather than letting \\"official\\" LDS doctrine speak for itself. For some reason it seems to bother our critics that certain LDS issues are either not fully defined (such as Book of Mormon geography, the translation process, or a host of other issues), or that LDS doctrines do not pigeonhole in their view of what LDS doctrine should be. Since official LDS beliefs are not such easy targets as they would like, they define LDS doctrine in ways that makes them easier to attack. This is known as the \\"straw man\\" argument. McKeever and Johnson frequently attempt to build straw man LDS doctrines by citing one or more LDS figures, as if such statements represent official LDS doctrine. What McKeever and Johnson fail to explain to the reader (and perhaps they fail to understand this themselves) is that not only do Mormons deny infallibility among their leadership, but we allow lay members and leaders alike, the free agency of publicly expressing personal opinions so long as they don't run counter to \\"official\\" LDS teachings.1 The three favorite tactics employed by McKeever and Johnson in their chapter on the Book of Mormon are: (1) \\"straw man\\" arguments, (2) \\"poisoning the well,\\" and (3) repeating accusations which have already been answered.\\"<br /><br />Bill McKeever is one of the most duplicitous, whiny persons I have ever come in contact with.  Recently he put out his bi-monthly hate letter in what he tried to disguise as something other than complaining about people having differences with him.  The article on the front page was about 1 ½ pages long.  In that letter, he had the unmitigated gall to say, \\"Mormons, as a rule, generally loathe criticism, no matter how accurate it might be.\\"  He has the gall to say that when most of his newsletter was complaining and whining about his work being criticized.  Come on, Bill, grow up. His exact words in that newsletter were, \\"We decided that we ought to provide rejoinders to these critiques\\", meaning Mormon responses to his often ugly remarks.  It's OK for him to have rejoinders, but when the Mormons do, they loathe criticism.<br /><br />No one loathes criticism more than McKeever.  I've talked to him once on the phone, and emailed him twice.  He emailed me back the last time I emailed him complaining about my criticism of him and, in other words, not being nice to him, and asked me to stop.  No one is more \\"NOT NICE\\" than Bill McKeever.  I won't go into the years of insinuations, insults, lies, and misrepresentations he has indulged in, but I will give one example:<br /><br />In his Nov/Dec. 2004 newsletter, after he says, \\"We decided that we ought to provide rejoinders to these critiques\\", he says, \\"Isn't this tossing pearl before swine?\\"  These are his exact words, but what is really ironic, before that statement he says, \\"We feel that we did a good job of pointing out the nuances of Mormon thought without resorting to the name calling so often prevalent in the writings of Mormon apologists.  So, there we have it, when Mormons call people names it's a very bad thing (I do happen to agree), but when McKeever and associates call Mormon \\"swine\\", that's OK.  Now, do you see why I call him the most duplicitous, whining person I've ever had contact with?<br /><br />But, that's not enough.  He goes on to say, \\".....not one of those responding claims to speak out on behalf of the Mormon Church.  Well, duh, Mr. McKeever, that's because they have no right to speak out on behalf of the Church.  It is personal opinion.  But, then, you already know that, don't you?  Well, maybe you don't.  Let's see why I say that:<br /><br />On page 3 of McKeever's four-page diatribe he quotes sayings he doesn't like from Church members. What's wrong with that, you might ask?  McKeever, every Mormon-basher, and every member of the Church knows most of that isn't Church doctrine.  This is just one more example of Bill McKeever misrepresenting things of the Church said as personal opinion.  People's personal opinions, even those of General Authorities, are not necessarily Church doctrine, and, as personal opinion, they are sometimes not worth what they cost--nothing.  McKeever knows that.<br /><br />Do denominations negate the Christian faith?  Here's another twist on Mormon practices.  He rages against the Church because at the Mormon Miracle Pageant in Manti, Utah, \\"...the play has always begun by mocking the Christian faith for its many denominations.\\"  Wait a minute.  Those people are not mocking the Christian faith.  For one reason, they consider themselves Christian, even if McKeever doesn't.  What they are doing is portraying Joseph Smith looking for the right Church and not being happy with any of those he attended.  He was confused by the disagreements and arguing among the Protestant sects, even as they do today, and the hatred, superstition, and jealousy that drove them to persecute others for different believes.  We all know about the Salem Witch Trials, and other atrocities performed by some who called themselves \\"Christian.\\"<br /><br />As they have done at the Miracle Pageant, over the years people like McKeever have gone into temples, recorded the events, taken pictures, and told stories on the internet, and in hate literature, using that information to dissuade people from the Mormon Church.  In order for a Mormon to go to the temple, which is one source for the anti-Mormon's twist on Church doctrines, a person must be a full tithe payer.  Tithe is one of the harder things to lie about because the Church has records, but it does happen. You must also declare you have engaged in no moral sins.  NO cameras or recording devices are allowed in the Temple.  These people lie to Bishops, lie to those in the Temple, break vows, and misrepresent the sacred events in the Temple in order to get into the temple so they can have \\"ammunition\\", as twisted as it may be, to write their anti-Mormon trash---and they do it all after vowing to keep the Church standards.  Oh, yeah, they do it in the name of Jesus Christ, too.  Bill McKeever may not have done this himself, but some of his sources of information have, and so have a lot of other people.<br /><br />The basis of McKeever's anti-Mormon book is built on irrational hatred of the Church, using man-made doctrine, which was borrowed from the Catholic Church, who borrowed some ideas from Judaism, then modified the early teachings of Jesus with some Greek philosophy to create the sects of Protestantism. These Protestants are offshoots of other Protestant sects; each sect, at one time or another, treating the other sect as horribly as they did when they persecuted, shot, burned out, and murdered Mormons, and often under the leadership of Protestant ministers.

You must also declare you have engaged in no moral sins.  NO cameras or recording devices are allowed in the Temple.  These people lie to Bishops, lie to those in the Temple, break vows, and misrepresent the sacred events in the Temple in order to get into the temple so they can have \\"ammunition\\", as twisted as it may be, to write their anti-Mormon trash---and they do it all after vowing to keep the Church standards.  Oh, yeah, they do it in the name of Jesus Christ, too.  Bill McKeever may not have done this himself, but some of his sources of information have, and so have a lot of other people.<br /><br />The basis of McKeever's anti-Mormon book is built on irrational hatred of the Church, using man-made doctrine, which was borrowed from the Catholic Church, who borrowed some ideas from Judaism, then modified the early teachings of Jesus with some Greek philosophy to create the sects of Protestantism. These Protestants are offshoots of other Protestant sects; each sect, at one time or another, treating the other sect as horribly as they did when they persecuted, shot, burned out, and murdered Mormons, and often under the leadership of Protestant ministers. It's no wonder Joseph Smith was so confused.

At least I'm not alone in my confusion as to what is supposed to be shown in this book.  Amazon really ought to let us give no stars. I went against my better judgement and bouoht a used copy, even though I don't buy books that the publishers no longer let us see inside of.  Now I know why they don't let us preview the book.

They seem to be \\"found\\" whenever there is a need for support for a radical social movement, like radical feminism<br />It has also been said by many others that a declining culture almost always seeks a mystic religion as support for their radical ideas.

This book is unmitigated junk.  Much of the &quot;history&quot; of the Mormons comes from people who hated and persecuted them.  Let me say that in another, more clear, but honest way: Most of the history of Mormons written by non-Mormons is written by consulting the writings of murderers, persecuters, and intolerant bigots who burned the homes, churches and towns of the Mormons, accused them of things they didn't do, called them every horrible thing they could think of, murdered their prophet, and ran them out of their settlements.  Much in the same way as Calvin, Zwingli and other leaders of the Protestant &quot;Reformation&quot; treated those who didn't agree with them.  Read the history before you disagree or comment.  These were ugly, terrible men, as were the Protestant and poliltical leaders who committed such atrocities against the Mormons. Again, don't respond until you read the history.  The real history, not anti-Mormon hate mongers.  Be aware that much of the information that comes from &quot;ex-Mormons&quot; comes from people who had been entrusted with the sacred &quot;rituals&quot; of the Church, but chose instead to not only expose all they knew, but to commit sacrilege against their former religion.  In other words, they are liars, sneaks, cheats. and hate mongers.  Quite a group to consult when writing a book.  Oh, yeah, how the heck do you claim to be knowledgeable about a religion you are not a member of by quoting other anti-Mormon books?  If he knew anything about the Church, he wouldn't have to consult other hate books.<br />These are the writings Mr. Abanes consulted in writing this horrible, horrible book of misinformation, bias, prejudice, hate, intolerance, and outright lies.	2004-06-11

People like Jozsef Kele, in his &quot;review&quot; below, who live in a world of fuzzy wuzzy fantasy, don't want to come to terms with the dangerous world we live in. Many cowards hide behind the cloak of &quot;conscientious objector.&quot; <BR>Why some people in this country can't see the connection between Syria, North Korea, and probably Iran, is beyond all understanding.  I guess they don't see it because they don't want to see it. I suppose that was the problem with Neville &quot;Peace in our time&quot; Chamberlain, who negotiated us into WWII. Do these people not understand that the socialist country of France was Iraq's biggest trading partner, and Russia is Iraq's biggest creditor?  Who needs Iraq oil the most, France or the U.S. Why is Russia Iraq's biggest creditor?  Why did Sadaam invade Kuwait? Did they do all this just to make us invade them. Wake up, all you people like Josef Kele. We have a war on our hands, and it just may be the worst war in world history.  It will take a dedicated war plan, as Col. Peters says.

That's were we get the terms &quot;sectarian&quot; and &quot;non-sectarian&quot;, words that Protestants use daily, but don't understand the meaning of.  The scriptures I have are no different than the Bible reviewed here.  They contain the author's results of their exercise in hermeneutics and exegesis.  In other words, they have read the Bible, done their homework, and written their interpretations, which if you study various commentaries you will find very similar no matter what the Christian sect or &quot;cult&quot; is.<BR>The idea in studying religion is to study with an open heart, and a brain--something that is remiss with many religious critics.<BR>Pay no attention to those who decry another's religion.

The human race has always given into the what they perceive as the easy way.  I saw a movie once where the actor said, \\"Everyone wanna go to heaven, but no one wants to die.\\"  In other words, no one wants to pay the price.  Admittedly, for most people, the conservative values are hard to live up to. On the other hand, the liberal way--anything goes--is attractive to most people.  Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a free lunch.  Someone has to pay, and as the USA moves closer to socialism, and closer to destruction of the American way, as we know it, those who pay will be a small minority at the top of the socio-economic ladder, while the rest hold their hands out for whatever they can get for nothing. I wonder if they will enjoy living like the socialist in Europe. I guess being pretty much anti-American, they can turn to America for help when they need us, and curse us when they don't. Why not, that's part of living in a socialist country, isn't it?<br />The natural man is selfish, greedy, lazy, slothful, and morally corrupt. These characteristics must be overcome by diligent attention to  improving on the natural man.  There is a passage in the scriptures of one religion that says, \\"The natural man is an enemy to God.\\"  Consider this; way too many liberals, or more appropriately, leftists, fall into one or more of the following categories: atheist, agnostic, socialist, communist, moral deviants, and haters of religion, especially Christianity.  Notice that they represent the opposite of what they hate; moral depravity vs. morally clean, and so forth.<br />Great group, huh?<br />It is easy to see why the author says they will win. At least temporarily, after promising their citizens the same things the liberals in this country offer our citizens, the Nazi's won, Stalin won, Jim Jones won, and so forth.<br />For example, look at the Hollywierdos who worship the gods of \\"Liberalism\\".  Where can you find more alcholism, drug addiction, divorces, sexual deviancy, and deviant children than with the actors who infest Hollywierd.<br />Mr. Reich, you are so correct, but our great grandchildren will never thank you for it.	2004-05-21

It is written from a Christian perspective, which is exactly what the negative &quot;reviewers&quot; don't like.

It is not a scholarly work.  It is not intended to be a scholarly work.  It is written for the masses, especially those not educated in things of the Bible, or much else.  It could be read by young people (well, some young people who actually received an education in today's public schools) because of the reading level and format.<BR>It is astonishing how divided this country is along both political and religious lines.

No one could have done better to prove Mr. Limbaugh's point than the leftist \\"reviews\\" here.  I call them \\"reviews\\" because most of them probably did not read the book; they just hate religion, despise Jesus Christ, and, in general, despise any kind of morals, principles, ethics, or even good manners.  The Hollywierdos demonstrate this perfectly. Too many of these whackos are alcoholics and drug addicts (I'm not an addict, I just have a bad habit), and many of them are so busy getting divorces and remarried multiple times, they don't have time for their addicted kids (some of Bush's and Mel Gibson's worst critics know what I'm talking about) Speaking of Mel Gibson, the leftist \\"crucifixion\\" of Mel Gibson pretty well proves the point.

Isn't it odd that the 9-11 commission is hearing exactly what Sean said about the budget, the manpower, and the emasculation of the CIA and FBI.  This goes all the way back to Jimmy Carter, as I remember.  This book is a must-read.  What Hannity says about the CIA and FBI is as close to the truth as you can get.  For many years before the Bush administration, our Congress and Administration hacked those agencies to pieces, and now those Leftist commissioners on the 9-11 commission are trying to blame it on Bush. Why aren't John Kerry and Daniel Patrick Moynihan being interviewed.  Read the book and you will understand why I ask that.	2004-04-14

It seems our fellow reviewer from Sag Harbor, who doesn't have the fortitude to sign his/her real name, has a lot of criticism for those who do have the courage to act.  If, as this character from Sag Harbor suggests, the book is as poor as he states, why is the 9-11 Commission interested in it enough to include it in the hearings?  If you have watched any of the hearings, read this book and put the pieces of the puzzle together, as far as it can be done at this time.  I think you will find it goes well with the line of questioning on parts of the Commission hearings.	2004-04-13

How can anyone, except a blithering idiot, deny all the terrorists acts during the Clinton years, and the lack of response, in most cases.  Clinton and his cronies hacked the CIA to piece.  I remember it as clearly as I remember one of his predecessors, Jimmy Carter, when he hacked away at the CIA. No one can deny that, and anything that the Bushes did, or did not do, does nothing to change the facts of Clinton's dereliction of duty.  <BR>This is a typical Democratic trick.  Screw things up, then blame everything on the Republicans.  Unfortunately, as in the case of Richard Nixon and the Vietnam war he inherited, it works too often.  Yeah, I know, I agree, he was a crook, and that made it easy, but still duplicitous.<BR>Wake up, people, the 90s were the worst years of terrorist attacks in history, and CLINTON DID NOTHING to stop them.<BR>History is history. The facts are there.  Do some reseach, leftists. You can find the proof in the newspapers of the time. It won't hurt you to spend some time in the library. Tell your kids to stay awake in history class. You didn't.<BR>Oh, BTW, the families of those Army Rangers in Somalia didn't act the way some of the survivors of the dead on 9-11 are acting.

I started to read all the reviews here.  That was until I got to stunning-reversal.com's stupid remarks, but, then, what would you expect from someone from San Francisco?<br />Ms Armstrong has spent a good deal of time \\"whitewashing\\" Islam. I get tired of hearing statements like \\"Islam is the most misunderstood religion in the world.\\"  No! No, it's not, Ms Armstrong.  We pretty much understand all that we see.  But, what you would expect us NOT to understand is the bloody spread of Islam by the sword, which you gloss over. You also gloss over the invasion of Europe by the Muslims.  But, worse than that, you and your compatriots write glowing reports of the dynasties in Europe, while forgetting that they shouldn't have been there at all. If it hadn't been for Charles Martel at the \\"Battle of Tours\\", when Muslims tried to conquer all of Europe, Europe would be Muslim today. This was long BEFORE the Crusades, Ms. Armstrong.<br /><br />And, what about Constantinople, Karen.  Why is there a \\"Turkey\\", a Muslim country on the continent of Europe?  I suppose it was given to them as a gift.  Did you not know that Muhammad's army slaughtered his own people at Badr?  He then told his army they did not slaughter the Quraysh; it was Allah (Qur'an 8:17).<br /><br />Are you not aware of the meaning of the word Islam: Submission?  It means \\"Bloody vengeance against one's enemies belongs not solely to the Lord, but also to those who submit to him on earth.\\"  Some kind of peace religion, huh?<br /><br />Now, let's talk about those horrible \\"tortures\\" of the Muslim prisoners. Putting underwear on someone's head is pretty horrible, huh, Ms. Armstrong?  Did you know that it is the assertion of Islam that \\"Prisoners taken in battle against the Muslims may be put to death at the discretion of Muslim leaders?  If you don't know that,Karen,watch the videos of the beheadings.  Beheadings are a Muslim practice,and have been for centuries. If you don't believe me read Qur'an 47:4.<br /><br />These are only a few examples of the \\"peace\\" of Islam.  The terrorists are doing what they've been brainwashed to do by the Qur'an.<br /><br />Indeed, Islam was spread by the sword.  I hope you wake up and tell the truth some day.	2004-04-06

I got quite a laugh when Rumsfield told the press on TV last Sunday that he wasn't even at one of the meetings where Clarke quoted him as saying something........  I don't know what it was because Clarke's book is not worth quoting.<BR>It just shows how biased one can be toward the truth.  I lived through those times that Richard Miniter writes about.  I saw them happen, and generally saw Clinton do NOTHING!  How can the leftists who disclaim this book deny what we know happened.<BR>Remember the 18 dead Army Rangers that Klinton left to their doom because of lack of planning and support?  The press barely covered that.  Talk about lack of planning in Iraq.  At least Bush didn't leave the soldiers to die without at least sending in support, when possible.<BR>It is interesting to note that the leftist rate the book low, and others rate it high.  Not much objectivity here.  I hope the day never comes when the conservatives act like the leftists. The leftists are going to split this country apart with their nastiness and negativism and lies.

This is a book about the Green Berets (Army Special Forces) in Afghanistan, and if perciatm from Gilbert, Arizona (see his review and rating)  would have looked at the cover he would have known this, and would not have had to read the book to find this out.<BR>One very offensive thing to me in the Afghanistan war was that once the Marines got there....long after the Army Special Forces had almost nearly won the war, along with their indigenous helpers....the news media reported endlessly on the Marines, who, in reality, had not done much of anything.  I wonder how the Army families feel to always be reading articles and seeing TV reports written and/or reported on by journalist who watched too many WWII movies.

She downplays, or doesn't mention, the Muslim slaughter of unarmed pilgrims, the Muslim slaves, the capturing of Christian boys whom they turned into involuntary soldiers-the Jannisaries- and, as has been mentioned, the invasion of Europe with full intentions of conquering all of Europe and converting it to Islam.  In most of her books she also glosses over the murder of fellow Muslims for the sake of power, and the wars between the different Muslim states.  It has become fashionable for some Western \\"intellectuals\\" to engage in self-flagellation, decrying the actions of Christians while totally, or mostly, \\"looking the other way\\", so to speak, when the same, or worse, atrocities are committed by Muslims.  Rarely mentioned is the fact that even today Muslims are engaged in slave trading, often capturing the young from their \\"enemies\\" and enslaving them as they did the Jannisaries.  I have no particular dislike for Islam.  I have Muslim friends whom I like and respect very much, HOWEVER, if you're going to tell a tale, tell the truth about both sides.  While I do not condone the behavior of many Crusaders I do think we can lay a lot of blame on all sides.  Some of these \\"Muslim apologists\\" seem to want us to forget that the Muslims invaded Europe centuries before the crusades, and the truth is that they did try to spread Islam by the sword.  At least many of the Crusaders had some good intentions.  Many of them just wanted to protect and have access to their holy sites.  Why is it that very few authors forget to mention that the Muslims took that land by the sword?  The Muslims had no more right to it than the Christians.  That land was inhabited by many people long before Muhammed and Islam.  The Crusaders attempt to preserve their holy sites has a lot more merit than the Muslims invading Europe for the express intention of killing off any Christian who  resisted conversion or acceptance of their rule.  And whyis it that some Western Muslim revisionist \\"historians\\" try to paint a beautiful picture of that \\"Ornament of the World\\", Spain?  A slave or conquered people in their own land are still slaves no matter how pretty of a picture the revisionist paint.	2002-11-19

You don't learn conjugation, declensions, and such before you speak your native tongue.  What's the point of teaching a language that way? The point of this book is to learn Latin words one word at a time.  There are excellent word lists for many uses.  <BR>     Yes, it is easy.  Of course it is.  It's supposed to be.  What's the point in writing a book that's too hard to understand or may make the person of casual interest quit?  No one speaks Latin in daily life today.  Most of us don't study Latin to speak it in conversations.  We study it to understand terms and phrases in medicine, pharmacy, science, law, and social sciences.  What we're after is RECOGNITION. .... ONE word or ONE phrase at a time.       <BR>     HOWEVER, the problem with books like these is there is NO AUDIO.  NO one learns a language without HEARING it!!!!!  I have Wheelock's.  It sits on my desk and is never opened.  I am not a Latin scholar, a linguist, or a language teacher.  I want to recognize the terms in the history and humanities books,  and I want to be able to PRONOUNCE them.  NO book can teach you that!!!  Watch out for the programs that do not offer audio.  You are NOT going to learn Latin very fast. You have to HEAR it!!!!  <BR>     After my disgust with Wheelock's I bought the Transparent Language Latin Now! program.

This is more a rating and review of several of Ms Armstrong's books.  Ms Armstrong writes revisionist or biased history in a lot of her books.  I agree with a previous reviewer, Ms Armstrong never, in any of her books, truly presents the horrific deeds of the Muslims.  Glossed over, or merely mentioned in most of her books are the murders of Muslim leaders by other leaders, the capturing of hundreds of thousands of non-Muslims, then making them not only slaves, but soldiers in their army, as with the Jannissaries. <BR> <BR>The Muslim invasion of Europe is presented as a glorious event of all-embracing love and toleration for non-Muslims, without mentioning how they built their society in Spain.  Had it not been for Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours the Muslims would have spread Islam by the bloody sword all over Europe.  I wonder how many innocent Christians and Jews Ms Armstrong would estimate might have died had the Muslims won at Tours and proceeded spreading the Muslim gospel throughout Europe?  Ms. Armstrong does mention the murder of Muslim leaders and descendants of Muslim leaders in the \\"wars\\" for leadership, but she never treats it with the same venom she uses when she \\"bites\\" the Christians in her attacks on them.  <br />It has become fashionable for many so-called intellectuals and authors to chastise Christianity.  If space would allow I'd list a few books for Ms Armstrong to read about the good that Christianity, including the Catholic Church, has done throughout history.  Maybe she, and others, can start with \\"Under the Influence\\" and \\"Christianity on Trial\\", both available here.<br />After the First Crusade there wasn't much more than  a pretext of being Christian anyway.  The reasons for going on the Crusades were anything but pious.<br />I wonder if it ever ocurred to Ms Armstrong that the Muslims had no more right in the Holy Land than did the Christians.  It wasn't their land either.  I do not condone the  actions of the Crusaders in the HolyLand or the sacking of Constantinople, or the cannibalism practiced by some crusaders.  I'm aware of all that.  However, the Christians had every reason to be alarmed that their holy sites were being taken over by Muslims.  So did the Jews.  There were no innocent Muslim invaders.  Did this ever occur to her or the rest of the Muslim apologists?<br />I know many Muslims and like them very much.  There are many good things about Islam, and there are many good Muslims.  In fact, many of the Muslims I know are embarrassed by much of what the Muslim leaders have done, today and throughout history.  If they can be honest, why can't Ms Armstrong?<br />Ms. Armstrong's book are easy reading, mostly good history, and very interesting.  I just wish she would tell it like it is with all parties concerned.	2002-07-23

I completely disagree with the person who said they were disappointed, then talks about them being amoral scum..etc.  The family is part of the person, and the way the parents raise the children is part of the story.  As a teacher I know this to be true.  At least 90% of the troubles we have with errant children can be traced right back to the parent and the home, or lack of home, situation.  I guess this person completely overlooked the references to that throughout the book, especially the part on Richard NOT being a homosexual.  I suggest this person go back, reread, and try to understand the role the parent plays.  The children are a reflection of the parents, and in this case they are all a bunch of scum, at least at some time in their lives.  I hope other authors learn how to write history from this author.	2002-07-11

The Crusades are  blamed for everything wrong between Muslims and Christians.  Of course, not only does this fuel the flames, it completely overlooks the Muslim invasion of Europe long before the Crusades.  This is a fact almost never mentioned in the anti-Christian diatribe.  If it had not been for Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours, all of Europe might be Muslim today, and the diatribe may well be anti-Muslim.  The truth is, Islam was spread by the sword.  Why is it that this is rarely mentioned?  Even in the public school history books it may only be given a paragraph.  Islamic history is often \\"revisionist\\" and full of lies, as is all history.  Muslims not only took slaves, but they deny slavery, even though they used slaves to fight for them.      It seems that in today's \\"Political Correctness\\" anything can be said about Christians, no matter how ugly the statement, but if one little statement is misconstrued about Muslim, or other religions, then that person is labled a \\"Bigot\\"?    If you don't think Karen Armstrong is a nut case, then look at this newspaper article and see what Islam is really like.     Iraq al-Qaida says pope, West are doomed By ANNA JOHNSON,      CAIRO, Egypt - An al-Qaida-linked extremist group warned        Pope Benedict XVI on Monday that he and the West were \\"doomed,\\" as protesters raged across the Muslim world to demand more of an apology from the pontiff for his remarks about Islam and violence.      The Mujahedeen Shura Council, an umbrella organization of Sunni Arab extremist groups that includes al-Qaida in Iraq, issued a statement on a Web forum vowing to continue its holy war against the West. The authenticity of the statement could not be independently verified.    The group said Muslims wouldbe victorious and addressed the pope as \\"the worshipper of the cross\\" saying \\"you and the West are doomed as you can see from the defeat in Iraq,        Afghanistan,Chechnya and elsewhere. ... We will break up the cross, spill the liquor and impose head tax, then the only thing acceptable is a conversion (to Islam) or (killed by) the sword.\\"    Islam forbids drinking alcohol and requires non-Muslims to pay a head tax to safeguard their lives if conquered by Muslims. They are exempt if they convert to Islam.    In Indian-controlled Kashmir, meanwhile, shops, businesses and schools shut down in response to a strike call by the head of a hard-line Muslim separatist leader to denounce Benedict. For the third day running, people burned tires and shouted \\"Down with the pope.\\"    Protests also broke out in Iraq, where angry demonstrators burned an effigy of the pope in Basra, and in Indonesia, where more than 100 people rallied in front of the heavily guarded        Vatican Embassy in Jakarta, waving banners that said the \\"Pope is building religion on hatred.\\"    The pope on Sunday said he was \\"deeply sorry\\" about the angry reaction to his speech last week in which he cited the words of a Byzantine emperor who characterized some of the teachings of Islam's Prophet Muhammad as \\"evil and inhuman\\" and referred to spreading Islam \\"by the sword.\\"    Benedict said the remarks came from a text that didn't reflect his own opinion.    \\"I hope that this serves to appease hearts and to clarify the true meaning of my address, which in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue, with great mutual respect,\\" he said during his weekly appearance before pilgrims in Italy.    The statement of regret -- the pope's second in two days -- helped ease some tensions.    In Turkey, where outrage against Benedict's remarks had been swift, Catholic bishops decided Monday that no changes were necessary in his upcoming visit in November -- his first to a Muslim country, Vatican spokesman George Marovic said.    Marovic said the trip was expected to go on as planned, and the bishops had discussed the details of a religious ceremony the pontiff is to lead in Istanbul.    However, State Minister Mehmet Aydin, who oversees the religious affairs in Turkey, said he expected Turkish authorities to cancel the visit if Benedict does not offer a full apology.    \\"We are expecting the authorities to unilaterally cancel this visit. The pope's coming to Turkey isn't going to foment the uniting of civilizations, but a clash of civilizations,\\" he said.    The secretary-general of the Turkish HUKUK-DER law association submitted a request to the Justice Ministry asking that the pope be arrested upon entering Turkey.    The appeal by Fikret Karabekmez, a former legislator for the banned pro-Islamic Welfare Party, called for Benedict to be tried under several Turkish laws, among them obstruction of freedom of belief, encouraging discrimination based on religion, and inciting religious hatred.    A prosecutor in the ministry will evaluate the request and decide whether to open a case.    Angry reactions also persisted in other corners of the Muslim world, where many demanded more of an apology by the pope than Sunday's statement of regret.     \\"Muslims have all this while felt oppressed, and the statement by the pope saying he is sorry about the angry reaction is inadequate to calm the anger -- more so because he is the highest leader of the Vatican,\\" Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar said.     More than 200 Muslims staged a sit-in at a shrine in Damascus,  Syria, heeding a call by the Damascus office of Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. A statement issued by the office urged the pope to \\"openly and plainly apologize for his remarks.\\"     Protesters also rallied in the city of Muzaffarabad, in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. \\"His apology is not sufficient because he did not say that what he said was wrong,\\" said Uzair Ahmedof Pasban-e-Hurriyat, a Pakistani political group.     Morocco's King Mohammed VI sent a letter to the Vatican in which he implored Benedict to show \\"the same respect for Islam that you have for the other religions,\\" Moroccan media reported. Morocco withdrew its ambassador to the Vatican over the weekend.     Even in China, where the government exerts tight controls over religious activities, a top religious official said Benedict had insulted the nation's Muslims.     \\"This has gravely hurt the feelings of the Muslims across the world, including those from China,\\" Chen Guangyuan, president of Islamic Association of China, was quoted as saying in an interview with the Xinhua news agency.     In the Middle East, where Muslims threw firebombs at seven churches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the weekend, Christian leaders posted guards outside some churches.     \\"We are afraid,\\" said Sonia Kobatazi, a Christian Lebanese, after Mass at the Maronite Christian St. George Cathedral in Beirut, Lebanon, where about a dozen policemen carrying automatic weapons stood guard.   ___     Associated Press writers Maamoun Youssef in Cairo, Aijaz Hussain in Srinigar, India, Benjamin Harvey in Istanbul, Turkey, and Slobodan Lekic in Islamabad, Pakistan, contributed to this report.  ------------------------------------------------------------  Don't for one minute think that it's just a few extremists. Those extremists are supported by millions of other Muslims. This is not to say Islam is bad and all Muslims are bad; but there are enough extremists to make the world a sad place at this time in history.	2002-03-28

Undoes much of the revisionist history on Custer, who was a scapegoat for the Grant Administration.  Custer did follow orders that day, but had to alter his plans to fit the unexpected circumstances.  The big lesson in this is that we should not second guess the commander in the field and use his ememies to testify against him.	1998-07-02
