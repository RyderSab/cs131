As we all know, people do not own cats.  Cats own people.  And that little fact of life is described wonderfully in this tale of the aloof cat who liked potato soup and the kind, caring man who liked to fish.  The illustrations and story are magnificent.	2005-08-24

I picked this book up at the library, but had to buy my own copy after reluctantly turning it in after having it four weeks and renewing it once.<br /><br />The illustrations of the unique, beautiful shrines and shadow boxes created by the artists are worth the price of the book even if you never make one.<br /><br />I'm no whiz at crafting, but the instructions are so simple, easy to understand and clearly written that I made 2 shrines in less than 2 weeks in my spare time.  Each example has several variations and each shrine has an easy to understand material list.  The instructions were even easy enough for a man to follow.  LOL!<br /><br />If you love collage, you'll love this book.  It's a wonderful way to take collaging a step further to a 3 dimensional, inexpensive medium that can become a collector's item or family heirloom.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!	2005-08-23

She totally rocks and writes like a house on fire.  I loved this story of a strong woman in the midst of a marital crisis.  The characters and settings are so vivid, I wanted to meet them and visit her house with the stained glass windows and the awesome greenhouse attached where she kept her little goddess altar.  A strong, wise story of the nature of love, forgiveness and well, a little getting even thrown in for good measure! I can't wait to read her other books!!!  I highly recommend it!!	2005-08-19

I picked up this book because I like to grow Moonflowers, which bloom at dusk and at night, and I loved the title.  What a wonderfully delicious first novel and delightful story this turned out to be!  The characters are so well defined you expect to run into them at Wal-Mart or the grocery store.  I love the way Ms. Holm brought full circle Macie's marriage (and baby-lust) and her cheating husband's repentance.  The final scene with his girlfriend is priceless.  (What woman among us hasn't dreamed of doing just that to a man we love/loved?)  And Dawn and Jewel stole my heart from the get-go.  This is a great tale about real people with real world problems and feelings.  I highly recommend it.  I thought it would be just a light, fluff read, but it turned out much, much more than that...and just what I needed to read at this particular time in my life.  Thanks, Ms. Holm, for a fabulous book!	2005-08-11

I got this book of poems in the mail yesterday and it was like a blue glass full of sunshine, a bag of silvery moonbeams, a box of perfect words with letters in the perfect order, ten dozen exotic orchids...you get the picture.  Can poems do all that?  Yes, that and so much more.  Novalis said that \\"Poetry heals the wounds inflicted by reason.\\"  Poetry is healing, uplifting, magical.<br /><br />A poem can save a life and calm a weary, heavy soul.  Words are things: concrete, healing, calming, comforting and consoling.  The poems in this book spoke straight to my heart and were a salve to my wounded soul.  Thanks, Ms. Davis, for sharing your poet-heart with the world.<br /><br />\\"The smell of ink is intoxicating to me -- others may have wine, but I have poetry.\\" ~Terri Guillemets<br /><br />A favorite poem, among many in this book:<br /><br />THE PANIC OF BIRDS<br />By Olena Kalytiak Davis<br /><br /> The moon is sick<br /> of pulling at the river, and the river<br /> fed up with swallowing the rain,<br /> So, in my lukewarm coffee, in the bathroom<br /> mirror, there's a restlessness<br /> as black as a raven.<br /> Landing heavily on the quiet lines of this house.<br /> Again, the sun takes cover<br /> and the morning is dead<br /> tired of itself, already, it's pelting and windy<br /> as I lean into the pane<br /> that proves this world is a cold smooth place.<br /><br /> Wind against window---let the words fight it out---<br /> as I try to remember: What is it<br /> that's so late in coming? What was it<br /> I understood so well last night, so well it kissed me,<br /> sweetly on the forehead?<br /><br /> Wind against window and my late flowering brain,<br /> heavy, gone to seed. Pacing<br /> from room to room and in each window<br /> a different version of a framed woman<br /> unable to rest, set against a sky<br /> full of beating wings and abandoned<br /> directions. Her five chambered heart<br /> filling with the panic of birds, asking: What?<br /><br /> What if not this?<br /><br />-------------------------.

I think I heard about this book through reading Kim Addonizio's poetry (which I highly recommend).  When I read the review the person wrote about the girl stealing the book from her book store I knew I had to buy it.  I'm SO glad I did.  This is one of the best books of poetry I've read this year.  It's soul-affirming, gritty, honest, down-to-earth, searing, heart-wrenching and just plain FABULOUS!  I'm eager to read more of Ms. Browne's work.	2005-07-27

After reading the first chapter early one morning I went outside to feed and water my cats and came in and wrote a poem about flowing water, tangled morning glories and memories of my mother.  It's one of the most inspiring, practical and encouraging books about writing poetry that I've ever read, and trust me, I've read them all.  It has technical information and poems to illustrate each chapter, which is very helpful.  The suggestions at the end of each chapter are down to earth and do-able, unlike some books that are just too high-minded for the average person.  If you love to write poems and just need some inspiration and a little advice and encouragement, then definitely buy this book.  It's worth its weight in gold!	2005-07-18

When you learn in the first chapter that the attorney (Victor Carl) was bopping his best friend, Guy Forrest's fiance, Hailey, then said attorney is called to the scene of Hailey's murder and finds Guy sitting naked on the front steps of the murder scene with the smoking gun in his hand!  Whoa!  This book grabbed me from the get-go and didn't let go until the final chapter when everything is wrapped up in a nice, neat package.  I haven't read a murder mystery this good in many moons.  If you're looking for a great summer read, get this one.  It won't let you down.	2005-06-15

Being an avid herbalist and fascinated with all things magical and mysterious, I found it all the more mesmerizing.  I've never read an author who creates such believable, true-to-life female characters.  The plot was tight, mysterious and fast-moving.  You don't really read Joyce's books, you tumble headlong into them and awaken in another realm altogether.  I've been reading books for 45 years and I've never read another author quite like him.  I highly recommend all of his books.  He's a bit like Alice Hoffman on mushrooms...	2005-06-13

I put the book down, sighed very deeply and contentedly, and immediately decided to purchase the book to keep forever.  (I happened upon it at the library.) It's more than the story of an herbalist in the mid-1960's, and it's more than a \\"fairy story\\".  It's a magical slice out of life, a trip out of this realm into the mystical, wise, unseen realm of \\"other\\" that some of us know exists (and have experienced for ourselves), but cannot prove.  I'm having trouble finding words to adequately express the beauty, depth and mystery of this one-on-a-kind tale.  That it is a book full of mainly female characters written by a male, just makes it all the more enigmatic to me.<br /><br />In short, buy this book, read it, treasure it, share it with your friends and above all, absorb the magnificent wisdom imparted therein.  I'd have to say it's one of the very best books I've read this year.	2005-04-27

This much anticipated follow-up to \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\" reads like a series of personal family vignettes and remembrances instead of a plotted novel.  I was very disappointed.  It was nice reading at the first of the book how the Ya-Ya's met as children, but the story quickly went downhill from there and became tedious and boring.  Save your money and check it out from the library.  I wish I had.	2005-04-04

I recently read \\"The Poet of Tolstoy Park\\" by Sonny Brewer which is a novel about the life of Henry Stuart. (Fabulous read!) Henry was a professor and disciple of Tolstoy and owned all of his books.  When Henry decides to sell everything he owns to move south because of illness, he has to whittle down his considerable library to what he can carry with him!  I shudder just imagining how to accomplish such a task.<br /><br />But this very tome, \\"A Calendar of Widsom:  Daily Thoughts to Nourish the Soul, Written and Selected from the World's Sacred Texts\\" is one of the few books he chose to accompany him on his journey.  I was intrigued and had to have the book.  (Isn't it funny how life is just one giant cross-reference of books?!)<br /><br />This is an amazingly rich, thought-provoking compilation of bountiful wisdom from the major religions of the world.  Mr. Tolstoy's favorite quotes are in italics on each page and it's fascinating, almost as if Tolstoy is sitting beside me, imparting his wisdom.  I think this book will become my bedside favorite and I highly recommend it.	2005-03-31

I wanted to buy a hundred copies and give them to everyone I know!!! (I don't ever recall feeling quite this way about a book.)  Thank you, Angie, for telling me about this story!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I owe you for this one.<br /><br />I have never in my life read such lyrical, soul-stirring, beautiful, original, exquisite, emotion-filled writing.

Yes, I sit here totally heartbroken this morning at having to give a Lamott book 2 pitiful little stars.  I read the intro poem at the front of the book and was mesmerized, inspired and excited.  I read \\"The Ham of God\\", the first essay and was in hog heaven (pun intended) and again, inspired and uplifted spiritually!  But as the essays went on, I could barely see Anne's wonderful, quirky, irreverent, shining faith for her bitter, mean-spirited, totally out of place attacks on the \\"right wing\\" and the current administration.  The book should more aptly be titled:  \\"Plan B: Thoughts on My Bitter Political Views\\".<br /><br />I own every single book Anne has written and even went to great trouble and expense to find her early out of print books.  I love them all, treasure them and keep them in a special place of honor in my home office.  I have recommended her books to hundreds of friends and bought countless copies of \\"Bird by Bird\\" for gifts....but this one, I have to say, missed the mark entirely.  It's misleading and most definitely NOT about faith.  It comes across overall as the rantings of an aging, cynical woman with tiny glimpses of her fading faith.<br /><br />Anne, listen to your wise pastor Veronica and get back to your roots of forgiveness, compassion and love for your fellow man.  Bitterness does not look good on you and is overshadowing your faith in your writing. I wish I'd spent the money I splurged on this book at Starbucks....at least I would have come away with a good taste in my mouth. I feel as if a good friend has betrayed me.... Don't buy this book if you're looking for the \\"old\\" Anne Lamott.	2005-03-21

His wife had died a few years before and his two sons were grown, so Henry was itching for some adventure in the last days of his life, and he also didn't want to burden his sons with having to care for him.  Henry is a practical, no-nonsense, seminary-educated disciple of Tolstoy, Black Elk and Chief Seattle, albeit a quiet, unassuming man whose simple life spoke much louder than his words. In magical, luminous words, he brings to life his hilltop on Mobile Bay where, when inspired by watching a pair of Ospreys build their nest, he decides to build a circular house. In struggling to come to terms with his impending death, he instead, discovers life and how to live it.<br /><br />This is a must-read and a must-own tome!  I plan to read it over and over again.  Thank you, Mr. Brewer, for such a magnificant work of literature!!!	2005-03-14

Mr. Crisp goes into a little more detail on topics such as colors (he gives many colors and their individual significance in dreams); houses (he breaks it down into rooms, walls, roof, etc.) and animals (many different animals are discussed).

I've read thousands of books in my lifetime and have never enjoyed a book more.  This book is, indeed, a comic masterpiece as several other reviewers mentioned.  I should get a commission from Amazon because I've recommended it to so many of my friends. I can't remember when I laughed so much (or so hard) reading a book.  I was in the bathtub reading one night and my husband thought I had gone bonkers because he kept hearing me laughing out loud.  I was reading the part where Ignatius came back from yet another day of hot dog vending with no receipts and had to explain about trying to put the stray cat in the bun compartment of his cart.  You just have to read it for yourself to get the full flavor of the scene.<br />Ignatius's mother is a literary marvel and their conversations and interactions are out of this world funny.  His many comments about her hiding her wine in the oven were hilarious.<br />I fell in love with Jones (Whoa! LOL!), the unfortunate black man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up working for minimal wage for a 'ho in the French Quarter.  Jones almost steals the book from Ignatius....<br />Mr. Toole captured the flavor and essence of New Orleans like no other author I've ever read.  It's a tragedy that he didn't live to see the success of this wonderful novel.<br />If you need a good laugh, or just cheering up, then read this book.  It shook me right out of my Winter doldrums and put me back on my reading path to enlightenment...	2004-04-13

People are used to my wacky stories about my family, but my new favorite wacky stories are about Feng Shui.<br />I read this book with much skepticism....but thought, &quot;Hey, it can't hurt, right?&quot;  A few years ago, a Feng Shui practicing friend of mine asked me if I closed the toilet lid when I flushed...I said, &quot;Sometimes, but not always....&quot; and she replied, &quot;You're FLUSHING away your wealth!&quot;  I had a good laugh, but decided to try it.  I began religiously to put the toilet seat down...and got an unexpected check in the mail from the IRS that year. Let me just say that has never happened before or since.<br />I decided to bone up on Feng Shui and did a Bagua map of my home and saw that my wealth area was my back bedroom which was in maxed out disarray due to a flooding problem which had recently been fixed.  I took a week off from work and totally remodeled the room....even put new furniture in....and my husband got a nice raise!  I know, it sounds crazy... but I think, in part, having an orderly home free of clutter destresses you and helps you become more peaceful and therefore more productive and happy.<br />This was a great book.  I can't comment on the love part as I've been married forever (but still love him), but I'm sure it can't hurt to try either! I highly recommend this book, if for no other reason, to get your home decluttered and more organized.	2004-03-26

For a long time recently, I felt as if I were sleep walking through life, with my soul outside my body (choosing perhaps to live in the poetry section of Amazon.com or somewhere equally exotic....) and then I picked up this book of poems.  I laughed, cried and sighed and I nodded my head with each poem I read and felt my soul come back to me......The magic of words!<br />Two of my favorites are \\"Finding Your Wife Was a Lesbian\\" (the last stanza is poetry at it's finest) and \\"The Clean House\\" (as a cat owner and wife of a \\"Mr. Clean\\", I wanted to frame this one....)<br />It's always exciting to discover a new poet, especially one whose poems you feel as if you could've written yourself.  Such are the poems of Sara King.  I highly recommend this book to all poetry lovers, women especially...it's on my keeper shelf.	2004-03-25

I felt as if I've been stuck in a vortex since my youngest child graduated from college, got married and flew the coop a few years ago.  All my life I thought I was looking forward to the day when my two daughters were grown so I could be 'free'.  I'd heard of empty nest, of course, and poo-pooed it thinking it happened to women who had no lives but their children's....NOT!  I still feel slightly lost, wounded and confused, but much better after reading this book.  And the loss of your children is, indeed, a wound.  They're alive and kicking, but gone nonetheless....and there's an emptiness there that you're not quite sure how to fill.  This book gives you permission (and encourages you) to just sit and wait out this life passage.  Thanks, Ms. Kidd, for your wonderful, beautifully written book.  I encourge all of my mid-life age friends to read it.	2003-11-10

I pleaded with the budget gods to forgive me this one last time and tossed it into my cart.  I sat down to read it when I got home and never moved from my chair until I'd read the last page.  What a story!!<br />It's chock full of Zen-like, thought-provoking insights about the important things in life like love, forgiveness, hope, friendship and living in the present moment.  The blue man was one of my favorite characters....what was heaven to him was hell to another...so true of real life!  So much depends upon our outlook, our circumstances and our attitudes.  I read somewhere that the worth of a book can be measured by what you carry away from it....in that case, this book is worth it's weight in diamonds and gold.  I'll treasure it and find it a home along side my favorite inspirational books.	2003-10-23

I cannot understand the significance of such a mean-spirited, opinionated statement in a book of haiku about inner peace.....it was like walking through a field of beautiful flowers enjoying the scenery and then suddenly hitting a brick wall. I stopped dead in my tracks, tore the book into pieces and put it in the trash.  I'd highly recommend in the future that the author(s) stick to the subject matter and not attack people's beliefs.  I have the utmost respect and reverence for all religions and could never have read this book in its entirety or even passed it along to my many haiku loving friends.  What a waste......	2003-10-16

To say it was lyrical is totally inadequate.  It was a labyrinth of discovery, a mesmerizing, poetic, erotic journey into the unknown.  I've never, ever become immersed in a book the way I did with this one.  I felt as if I'd tumbled into the story and become Liza.  It left me dizzy, dazed, exhausted and wanting more. I highly recommend this book if you want to truly experience another culture.  The language is pure magic and the plot ingenious.	2003-09-24

I ran me a hot tub of water last night after a very long day at work and got in the tub with your book....and didn't get out until I'd read the last page.

I've come to depend upon Luanne Rice's books to always be riveting, romantic and well-written and this one did not disappoint me.

(Guess I'll order an extra copy to keep for myself.)  Each chapter deals with a 'miracle' that happens at the Van Gogh Cafe which is run by Marc and his daughter.

I felt somehow changed inside when I finished the last page---enlightened and educated about Middle Eastern people and in awe of their myths, food and lives.  I came away changed, enchanted and wanting to visit the Baghdad of Han and Sirine's story.  Ms. Abu-Jaber has woven a beautiful, intricate, sweet-scented tale of love, food, families and life.  The descriptions of the food made such an impression on me that I went and found some of the recipes from the story to make for myself so I could experience the flavors and make them my own.

The writing was excellent, the plot engaging and the characters highly entertaining.  I particularly loved Alice's grandmother, the feisty 89 year old former actress who loved to dress in designer clothes and wear red lipstick when company came over.<br />Alice Hammond is a single thirty-something working woman in Manhattan when her jerk boyfriend of five years (Nick) dumps her via telephone for another woman and gives her six weeks to clear out of his apartment.  Alice is staying with her crotchety grandmother temporarily until a caregiver can be replaced (and unbeknownst to her at the time, she is pregnant) and thus begins this tale of this unique, colorful family.  My only regret was that the book ended when it did.  I loved the character of Dan and would have liked to seen his character developed more. Perhaps a sequel is in order, Ms. Lewis!?	2003-05-30

It's the story of Beverly Donofrio's search for meaning in her life via the Virgin Mary.  She started out collecting Mary icons at yard sales and soon had an entire room dedicated to Mary.  God does work in mysterious ways.<br />She delves in depth into her relationship with her son and how God healed that part of her life.  But I had to laugh out loud at one statement she made. She said she just couldn't understand why God did not include Mary in the Trinity, bless her heart.  What most people don't know (and male preachers/priests seldom ever mention) is that in the Old Testament God is referred to as El Shaddai.  Shaddai is formed from \\"shad\\" (the breast) Genesis 49:25 or \\"The Breasted\\" - the \\"Nourisher\\", \\"the Strength-Giver\\", the \\"Satisfier\\" who pours Himself/Herself into believing lives.

It's fascinating reading about how my favorite Sheryl Crow songs were birthed into existence. That was my favorite part of the book and Mr. Buskin did a superb job of detailing the history of all of her songs. This is a gripping story of Ms. Crow's rise to fame via determination, hard work and a single-minded ambition to succeed. I came away applauding her tenacity, her talent and her sheer will to survive in the dog-eat-dog music business. If you enjoy Sheryl Crow's music then this book is a must-read for you.

Hubby and I decided to read this book aloud to each other every night before bed, taking turns with chapters.  I have to tell you that I have never, ever laughed so hard in my entire life.  Reading this book was a blast...a total blast! The story of how his parents met was worth the price of the book, not to mention the story of how his mother shot the dr's dog.  Truth IS stranger than fiction.  Mr. Duncan's family is one-of-a-kind and about as eccentric as they get in a very readable way.

The suits are Mason Jars (cups), Pens (wands), Guns (swords) and Watches (coins/pentacles), each of these items having been invented during the Victorian era...a bit of history to add to your tarot knowledge.

Those yankee reviewers are just out of the loop and need to spend a few summers below the Mason-Dixon line. And it helps to even better understand this one if you're a Boomer and have already experienced a hot flash/mood swing or two!! LOL! This book had me howling with laughter and nodding my head in appreciatation of Ms. Linwood's fabulous wit.  And her family is priceless.  Talk about typical Southern family!!  I loved every single character.  My only regret was that Lin didn't get a good romp in the hay with old Grant before she booted his butt out the door...but her munching the (unknown to her at the time) marijuana-laced brownies from her old lesbian pal more than made up for the disappointment.

This is the best book yet of Connolly's three novels I've read. You'll enjoy them more and better understand the story line if you read them consecutively, though.

Okay, I'll admit I bought this book because of the fabulous cover art.  Not the first time I've done this, sad to say.  But the circle of stones in front of the refrigerator intrigued me and my imagination went wild with the possibilities of the story line.  It was not what I expected, but I'd probably buy it again, if only for the great cover.  The story was a bit unbelievable and convoluted, but interesting.  You've got to admire the author for her spunk in writing this little tome.  I'll definitely give her another chance and read more of her writing. In the future I'll also try to remember that worn old adage, \\"You can't judge a book by it's cover....\\"	2003-03-19

I loved every single book.  She gets better and sharper with each consecutive story.  Ms. Seranella's stories have the flavor of hard-core reality with just the right touch of suspense and plot twists. No writer I've ever read has the drug scene down the way she does....you can feel the despair and hopelessness of the characters radiating from the pages....and then comes Munch, a ray of hope as one who escaped the druggie lifestyle, a true survivor.  Thanks Ms. Seranella for a great series.  Keep 'em coming!!	2003-03-19

So far, it's my favorite book on the Tarot, bar none.  I love the explanation of the symbolism of the minor arcana cards, the history, the Kabbalah connections and the mythological connections.  It's amazing how much easier it is to learn (and step into) the cards when you have some historical perspective to draw upon.  I memorized the suit of Swords and the suit of Cups this weekend after reading the chapters on each of them.  If you're new to Tarot and desire a deeper knowledge of the minor arcana, then this book is a must-have for your Tarot library.	2003-03-17

This was my very first Tarot deck and I'm glad I started with this soothing, beautiful, informative deck. I'm an avid herb gardener and love that each card has a corresponding herb. You really need the book, though, to fully understand how the herbs are incorporated into each Tarot card and its meaning.  I now have three decks and this one is still my all time favorite.  The backs of the cards are beautifully illustrated with Rosemary plants and a couple of red lady bugs. The colors on the cards are soothing, soft and subltle. If you love herbs and are seeking to know yourself better through the Tarot, then this is the deck for you.	2003-03-14

Having grown up in the Baptist South, I was afraid of it at first, but after much research and study, I've found that's it's not a 'tool of the devil' but an instrument for self-discovery, creativity and knowledge.  I've taught myself how to read the cards from this book and have enjoyed it immensely.  I highly recommend this book.	2003-03-13

It's true, and Ms. Hepinstall gets to the very soul of motherhood in this haunting, lyrical tale of loss, love and the fragility of sanity. I love the vivid descriptions of the caves and the fairy tale quality of the entire story.  The ending brought tears to my eyes and literally made me gasp.  God, I love a good surprise ending!

She's got an exciting life and has such original ideas...like planting poison ivy in all of her window boxes to make anyone who breaks in easy to identify or using a spray glue gun as a weapon of choice (not to mention the epilady!)  Her family members are not unlike my own, particularly Aunt Mo.<br />I adored the fast-paced, unusual, hilarious S&M plot. Ms. Hayter's talent with wisecracks and word play is priceless.  The description of Robin's evil neighbor's robe as 'looking like it was made from teddy bear pelts' had me rolling!  What a fabulous description!  It's worth buying this book just to get to know the unique characters. Thanks for a super read, Ms. Hayter.  Keep 'em coming!	2003-02-27

I don't know how I got to be in my 40's without having read this wonderful author!  My best friend, Sonja, called me a few weeks ago and recommended this as a 'must read' and since she and I have almost identical reading tastes, I immediately went to the library to hunt it down.  I was not disappointed.<br />This is a story of everyman and everywoman; a story of healing in the face of tragedy; a story of living life to the fullest even when life deals you a horrific blow; a story of deep friendship and ultimately survival in this sometimes cold, cruel world.<br />The writing is poetic, lyrical, intoxicating.  I have two whole pages of quotes written down from the book and fully intend to buy my own copy.  It's a definite keeper.  I highly recommend this author is you're a lover of excellent writing.	2003-02-26

It always cracks me up when Ms. Smith brings Detective extraordinairre, Skip Langdon into the story....she's the main character in her excellent Skip Langdon series.

I paused for a minute or two and was totally present in the moment.<br />The only reason I noticed all of this momentary splendor was because I read this book last night....in one sitting....I couldn't put it down or stop reading once I got started.

The plot is as tight as the sheet on a new recruit's bed and full of twists and turns that kept me guessing until the end.

My daughter loaned me this book...we laughed at the title because she and her husband call each other \\"Fred\\" (which is neither of their names).  I read it in one sitting.  I couldn't put it down.  It's the story of 15 year old Mary Fred who has grown up in the twisted cult of 'Fred Brown'....they all have Fred in their names and they all wear the color brown and are all waiting for the big \\"Cat\\" to come (you gotta read this book for more on that!).  They don't believe in medical care, so when two of Mary Fred's young brothers die, the parents are arrested and the children are all put in foster homes.  That's when the heart-warming story really begins.  This is a story of the healing power of love and the power to change and grow and let go of the past.  I'm not sure who learned more, Mary Fred or her foster family of Alice, Uncle Roy and Alice's daughter, Heather.  I loved each of the characters and hated to read the last chapter---a sure fire sign of a great book!  Thanks, April, for loaning me this one....I promise to return it...eventually!!	2002-05-30

I think Casey could whip Stephanie Plumm...after all, Casey *is* a Southern girl!!!  This is my favorite book in the series.  It's fast-paced, non-stop action.  I highly recommend every one of her books!	2002-04-05

I guess when you get right down to the nitty gritty, we're all alone in this world, orphans of a sort....and we're all looking for life's meaning....just like Lyman as he sat on his front porch drinking coffee at the same time every day trying to capture the present as it turned into the past....or the future.  It took an old weather-beaten parrot and an inquisitive librarian with sand in her boots to teach him the true meaning of life.  I plan to get copies of this book for all of my friends.  It's a keeper!!	2002-04-03

I dearly loved this book...It renewed my faith in mankind!<br />It's the classic, quintessential Southern Woman's novel.  I laughed, I cried, I sighed and I cheered for these wonderful characters.  It's a novel about everywoman and everygirl.  I passed it on to both of my daughters and they loved it, too.<br />I bought this book in hardback at Sam's and I know I'll go back to buy many more copies for friends.  The story is beautifully written and totally heartwrenchingly touching.  My favorite character was May, who \\"wore her heart outside her body.\\"  Buy this book, read it and treasure it!

A friend gave me these cards for Christmas and I've been organizing and decluttering (improving my Ch'i) ever since!  They really work!  The little book that comes with the cards very succinctly explains the philosophy of Feng Shui and how to incorporate it into your life.  There's a card for every room in your home and a before and after picture of a room that has been made Feng Shui complaint.  I highly recommend these to anyone seeking to get orgazined or simplify your life!  Thanks, Angie!!	2002-01-13

The characters in the story are so real you expect to come home and find them sitting in your living room on the couch where you last left the book....I laughed until I cried in several chapters and wept in others.

There's absolutely no way you can call Anais Nin's lush erotica either 'smut' or 'pornography'.  It is much to poetically, tastefully, artfully written to debase it with those negative terms.  She delves into the soul of woman as no other writer, whether writing erotica or in her luminous diaries.  Every woman should read her work to better understand her own soul's journey.....Her words take flight and transport you to inner landscapes too wonderful for words.......If my house were on fire and I could only save one author's works, it would be all of Ms. Nin's books that I own....	2001-10-26

I've now read every single one of the Skip Langdon books (even one that is out of print) and I can't find one single complaint about the ENTIRE bunch!  The plot was ingenious and riveting in this 12-step murder whodoneit.  There were so many suspects, I was baffled to the very end---but I *did* have my suspicions.  LOL!

This is my first of Julie Smith's books and I'm hopelessly hooked!  I ran to the library as soon as I finished reading this one to check out the Skip Langdon series.....<br />The Baroness Pontalba is the hippest, smartest, coolest female detective I've read about in years.  No ditzy, air-head here! Her relationship with her cantankerous boss, Eddie Valentino, was a special, touching part of the plot.  I thoroughly enjoyed the subplots of the healing of Eddie's relationship with his estranged son and the Baroness's search for her father.  Ms. Smith definitely knows New Orleans and her love and knowledge of the city shines through on every page.  The dialogue was lively, sharp as a tack and captivating.  I hated to read the last chapter---I wanted the story to go on and on.  Ms. Smith, I hope and pray you're working on the next in a series with the enchanting Baroness!!!

This book was my first foray into the genre of mythical fiction and what an introduction! I'm hopelessly hooked. I loved the way Ms. Windling wove real people into her fictional story (Henry Miller and Anais Nin to name a few). The haunting beauty of the desert jumped out from the pages and gripped my heart making me want to visit the desert for the first time in my life. I'm a water person by nature (Moonchild) but long to see the desert now and experience it's magic for myself. This book is a poem. No other way to put it.

Every single moment is enlightenment if only we are open to it, says the author in the introduction.  So true.  It's like when you buy a new car, say a Buick Regal, and suddenly you see Buick Regals everywhere.  Every time you get on the highway, there's another Buick, just like yours!  Now, why is that and why didn't you ever see them before?  It's because you're AWARE of that particular car now.  So to be aware of life, in all of it's gory and glorious detail, we must SEE, open our eyes.  We must be awake and present which is easier said than done.  I know I find myself living in every time zone but the present one more often than not.  We're usually thinking of tomorrow or yesterday and seldom appreciate the here and now.  This book is a wonderful guide for learning to be present, to meditate and to awaken to the present moment.	2001-09-03

I have to disagree with the fella's review down below me who said that genre novels do not deserve five stars!  Hogwash! Shoot, I only review books that deserve five stars.  If it's not a good book, why read OR review it?  Which leads me to declare my life's motto:  So Many Books, So Little Time!<br />This first book in the China Bayles series is excellent.  I read &quot;Lavender Lies&quot; first and thought I might be disappointed in the first book of the series, but I was proven wrong!  We're introduced to all of China's cohorts in Pecan Springs, Texas and get the dirt on everyone.  Ms. Albert immediately draws us into solving the murder of China's friend (who has terminal breast cancer) who appears to have comitted suicide.  It's a wild plot with suspects galore, but I was totally surprised when the murderer was finally brought to justice by China and Ruby.  Good, fast-paced read.

For Ella, with this unraveling, comes truth, love and revelation.  This was a beautifully written book that I pulled a late nighter to finish. Ms. Hearon's descriptions of the rose gardens were awesome.  You could literally see and smell the roses in Ella's \\"imaginary\\" garden (which is a tale in itself).  I also highly recommend all of Ms. Hearon's books.  She gets better with each successive novel!	2001-06-04

China has my dream life:  the herb shop, Thyme and Season; the tea room, Thyme for Tea; the sideline job of writing a gardening column for the local newspaper; not to mention the young hunk, Mike McQuaid!!!  I think I better go back to the beginning, though, and work my way through the entire series. I love the herbal lore and recipes that begin each chapter as I have my own herb gardens.  I didn't think China and McQuaid would EVER make it to the alter, but thankfully, they did in spite of murder, mayhem and a hurricane! Ms. Albert is a primo mystery writer and kept me guessing right up to the end.  China's friends, Ruby, Smart Cookie, The Whiz, et al are icing on the cake of the plot, especially Ruby with her new age shop and flamboyant outfits.  I highly recommend this book, especially if you're into herbs and love a good, fast-paced, well-written mystery!	2001-06-03

I was talking to a friend the other day who's read this series and we both agreed that we'd love to live in Pecan Springs, Texas and be one of China's quirky friends!  The true test of a good mystery is that it keeps you guessing right up to the end, and this one more than fills the bill.  The characters are as real as they come and some of the most interesting 'people' I know!  LOL! Reading a new China Bayles mystery is like arriving at a party and discovering that all your favorite people are there.<br />In this tale, China is appalled when she hears that her friend, Dottie (The Cat Lady), has been accused of murdering the mean old Professor Harwick (who's been known to threaten her cats) and sets out to find the real killer.  Lots of intriguing twists and turns in this interesting, well-crafterd plot.  Thanks, Ms. Albert, for creating such an entertaining, likeable character in China Bayles!	2001-06-03

Jane Croy), the most unlikely bigamist T'ai Chi warrior there ever was!  The book starts out with Jane running away from her husband of one month, Alan.  Of course, before she departs the marital abode, she pauses to do her T'ai Chi pose.  Here's an excerpt from page 2:<br />&quot;Slowly, slowly, I begin T'ai Chi.  I relaxed my body, stilled my mind, let the energy come from the earth through the soles of my feet into my self.  I tried to move like the ocean water, like the fog---muffled movements.  I smiled when I got to the part of the form called Crane Spreads Wings, looking to the cormorant for approval, although with my right hand above my head and the left held by my side, it was more of a wings-in-flight pose than the hanging-wings-out-to-dry stance of the cormorant.&quot;<br />Susan Trott very artfully and skillfully weaves the T'ai Chi poses into each chapter, in fact, entitling each chapter with the name of a pose.  This is an ingenious and beautifully written story of one woman's search for balance and meaning in her life. I can't wait to read more of Ms. Trott's superb fiction.	2001-06-03

I've read thousands of romance novels, but this is by far one of the most subtly erotic, tender, beautiful, enchanting, bittersweet tales I've ever read.  You come away knowing that love is not merely for the young or the perfectly healthy person. Maggie and Tristan renewed my faith in love and life.<br />The gardening knowledge in each chapter is worth the price of the book alone and seeing the exotic gardens at night through Maggie and Tristan's eyes was hypnotically mesmerizing.

Luckily, I received this book as a gift right at the start of Spring this year and it's helped me tremendously in getting organized for my flower and vegetable gardening. I'm laying claim to half of my husband's storage shed in the back yard to start my own potting area!  The photographs of potting sheds, potting spaces and benches are a visual feast.  I particularly enjoyed the potting and gardening tips in every chapter.  There are also useful tips on gardening tools and supplies, storage and seed starting.

Yoga encourages us, as women, to be fully present in our body, mind and spirit and to listen to our bodies, something we often neglect to do in the fast-paced, stressed out, harried lives most of us lead.  My favorite chapter was Chapter Four - Life Events, which guides you through postures to bring into your basic program when your life is passing through particular events or emotional phases.

Exploring dreams is fascinating---like charting mysterious, unknown waters or discovering a new unexplored continent---the unconscious mind.  This book is the most insightful, informative and visually beautiful book I've ever read on dream interpretation.  The author gives wonderful case file studies of actual dreams and the interpretation which I found extremely helpful.  And the illustrations and artwork:  Mon Dieu!  They're delightfully funny, exotic and perfect!  I love the picture on page 101 of a woman wearing a cat suit and a man wearing a bird suit who are sitting at at table over a drink.  The man/bird is tied up and the cat/woman is casually smoking a cigarette and appears to be interrogating the poor fellow.  Through a window we see the shadows of a party going on right outside the door.  I don't know about you, but I do tend to have some weird dreams, and this book helps me to better understand their meaning.<br />I love what Emily Bronte had to say about dreams in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;:  &quot;I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas:  they've gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the color of my mind.&quot;<br />I also recommend &quot;The Dream Pack&quot; by David Fontana which contains a dream book, a dream journal, an eye pillow and a package of 20 dream cards to help you understand and interpret dreams.

I love Ms. Ginsberg's upbeat attitude and the fact that she loves her job.  She's so right that most people talk about waitresses like they're lower on the job chain than prostitutes when nothing could be further from the truth.  As eating out seems to be a national past time, you'd think waitresses would be revered right up there with football heros!  Just try to imagine life without them.  I like the way she integrated statistics about the job and interwove threads of her life story into it; it was very interesting and enlightening.  To those of you who gave bad reviews, this is not a novel, for heaven's sake, it's a memoir and a very well written one at that!	2001-02-25

I must say that I was flabbergasted when I read the chapter on &quot;The Promise&quot;.  I thought my girlfriends and I had invented that concept years ago and here it was in black and white for all the world to see!  This book should be required reading for every female upon reaching puberty---to better understand the male mind.  These Queens have it all figured out and share &quot;it&quot; with such hilarious results that you'll want to read this book over and over and buy copies for all of your friends.  I plan to give my Mama a copy since she's from Mississippi herself and will certainly understand the joie de vivre of the Queens.<br />The recipes at the end of the book are fabulous and worth the price of the book.  I must say my very favorite chapter was the last one, Chapter 14.

As luck would have it, there it sat on the new book shelf right inside the front door.<br />I read this book straight through in one sitting just like Anne Lamott did which she relates in her blurb on the back cover. I also plan to read it again today, much more slowly and contemplatively.  What blew me away was the spiritual depth of the book, the slow, painful dawning of enlightenment (much like watching a magnificent sunrise that takes the silent landscape from total blackness to a sparkling kaleidoscope of color and birdsong), that Sister John experiences.<br />The clincher for me was that I heard the author relate that he is not a spiritual person. Well, Mr. Salzman, whether you know it or not, you ARE a spiritual being (as we all are) and God has used you to pour another little pitcherful of light into this dark, thirsty world.  And I thank you!	2000-10-29

A friend who lives in South Carolina recommended this author to me and I must thank her here.  Thanks, Angie! What an engaging story written with such simple, easy to read style.<br />I came away with respect and awe for the main character, Mae Lee Barnes, who raised five children without the help of a husband OR welfare or food stamps. Mae Lee's mother and father instilled in her the value of hard work and saving money and she became a land owner in a time when few blacks owned land---much less a black woman with five children.  This book is the intriguing story of her life.  Very enjoyable, uplifting read!	2000-10-22

This book has replaced &quot;Bird By Bird&quot; by Anne Lamott as my all time favorite book about the craft of writing.  Stephen King gets down to the nitty gritty with practical, sensible advice to would-be writers with lots of examples from his own experiences.<br />I particularly enjoyed the autobiographical accounts of his childhood and early years.  The stories were funny and melancholy, uplifting and inspiring.  The poison ivy incident with his brother was worth the price of the book and had me laughing and chuckling for days.<br />The last chapter describing the details of his near-fatal accident was fascinating.  I now admire Mr. King not only as an excellent author, but as a survivor.  His life story shows that just because you have money and success doesn't necessarily mean that you're immune from heartache, pain and tragedy.  Thank God that he survived that horrible accident to finish this book and share his hard-earned wisdom with us all.  Everyone should read this book, whether you're interested in writing or not, then pass it on to a friend.	2000-10-22

This one for instance on page 22:<br />&quot;She comes out of the stall looking horrible, more awful than usual.  &quot;God, Janice, go easy.&quot;  Wetting a paper towel, I try to wipe the blood off her arm and the drool from her chin.  She looks at me with void eyes, a junkie who doesn't know any better. I sit her on the floor and watch her come back from that place that isn't quite death but isn't quite life either.  I smile at her, knowing she isn't looking.  I like secretly watching the life come back into her features, white lips go pink, cheeks rose up, then her eyes recognize me again.  Her hands shake, and it's clear to both of us she's just trying to get straight, chasing a high lost years ago.&quot;<br />The story was sad, particularly because it was written with so much authority by such a young girl, who obviously knows the junkie lifestyle firsthand. I just hope that young people who read it don't idealize the drug culture, but learn from Miranda's mistakes.  Good luck, Molly, and keep writing.  You're a very talented young woman and very lucky to have gained a measure of wisdom from your experiences.	2000-10-12

Annie Dillard propels me to a precipice far above the mind-numbed, robotic routine that is my life and shows me----what?  Clouds, my mortality, my smallness, eternity, a grain of sand, my own soul?  She illuminates the magnificent in the ordinary, the magic in the mundane, God in a deformed child.<br />For a moment it's as if I'm Dorothy in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;,  sitting on that bed in Auntie Em's house which is spinning out of control in the midst of a tornado, and life is passing me by in fast-forward like the characters whizzing by the window and I'm just amazed, clutching Toto, too stunned to react.  And then in the next moment of reading, serene illumination.  I get it!  It all makes sense and I no longer feel like a tiny, insignificant morsel of clay, but a vital, significant part of the whole.  What a breathtaking patchwork quilt of wisdom and philosophy this tiny book is!<br />Thank you, Annie, for yet another priceless gem from your wonderful intellect.  I'm reminded of my favorite quote by Kafka: &quot;The books we need are the kind that act upon us like a misfortune, that make us suffer like the death of someone we love more than ourselves. . .A book should serve as the ax for the frozen sea within us.&quot;	2000-09-30

I stood and read through this book in Books A Million and cried my eyes out right there in front of God and everybody, then forked over the full  price for the book (which I rarely do---I usually get them here at Amazon  discounted).  This is the very best book I've ever read on losing a pet.  My old cat is 14 years old and just the thought of him being in this  &quot;Cat Heaven&quot; made me smile and laugh out loud (after the tears!)  I read this to my four year old grandson after he'd lost a kitty and it  comforted him, too. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever  loved and lost a beloved pet.

Reading Bailey White is as refreshing as sitting in the porch swing on a  hot summer day with a sweating glass of cool iced tea with a sprig of lemon  mint enjoying the occasional breeze.  No one can capture the essence of the  South like Ms. White.  Her stories are funny, thoughtful and bittersweet.  I've laughed and cried reading these stories of Bailey and her  irrepressible Mama. One of my favorite stories is when Mama makes up her  mind that she wants some smoked mullet and they have to go down to Rosey's,  &quot;a tough juke joint on the edge of the marsh in an old-fashioned part  of Florida where tourists don't even go because they have more sense.&quot;  Each story will grab your heart and give it a little squeeze.

That  they're all still sharing an apartment together 30 years after Harvey Nash  (now Nash Harvey)dumped oldest sister, Adele, on the evening of their  engagement is perfect irony.  From their setting up empty glass bottles  inside their apartment door as an inexpensive burglar alarm to the  surprising love lives of each of them, you can't help but fall in love with  this unusual family. Nash Harvey is the character you love to hate, who  picks up women at the drop of a hat, and has never once committed to  anything but his reflection in the mirror.  He tries his charms on each of  the sisters and the results are hilarious.  Great book and wonderful, sassy  characters!!!!	2000-09-07

The book is about a model, Alison, who struggles with anorexia, then  becomes a successful author when she writes a semi-autobiographical book  about the fashion industry.  She finds an old photograph in her husband's  house of one of his ancestors with his wife and becomes intrigued with the  unhappy-looking woman in the photo. She finds out that the woman in the  picture committed suicide by walking into the sea and goes to the town  where it all happened to do research and write her second book about this  woman, Arabella.  The twist, which you learn very early on in the first  chapter (so I'm not giving anything away here), is that Alison ends up  committing suicide by doing the exact same thing in the very place that  Arabella did it and her husband is left to unravel the mystery of her  death.<br />This was a real page turner and very well written.  The plot  sucked me in like a Hoover and didn't let go until the very end when it  builds to a dramatic conclusion.  Wonderful read!!!!!	2000-09-06

NOBODY, but nobody can write a funnier, wittier, smarter or sexier book  than Janet Evanovich.  She is the reigning queen of the one-liner!  I keep  thinking there's no way that her books can get any funnier, but they do.  This side-splitter sees Stephanie and Grandma Mazur becoming temporary  roommates and Stephanie becoming the proud owner, of sorts, of a golden  retriever, Bob.  I think Bob stole the story from Grandma Mazur as far as  hilarious scenes go.  I don't even want to give one away, they're all so  good.  I highly recommend this book and ALL of Janet's books for a  wonderful, light-hearted escape from reality.  Reading her books instantly  erases all of your worries and cares.

I once heard Oprah say that we need to nurture ourselves the way we might nurture and care for our best friend. . . and that really blew me away as I  have always been very hard on myself.  This book gave me the tools to begin  to learn how to do just that.

I want to highly recommend it to anyone who has suffered  a painful childhood.  It fills you with hope and gives you the courage to  look at the garbage from your past, toss it out and get on with your life.<br />To quote part of the Publisher's Weekly blurb on the back of the book,  &quot;Like a lullaby, this gentle book soothes the spirit, reaching out to  the inner child and reassuring the wounded adult...&quot;	2000-09-02

I'd bypassed this book at the library for months before I finally got around to picking it up this past week.  It must've been karma that I  decided to read it during the heat wave of 2000 we're having here in  Louisiana.  I could feel the cool ocean breezes of Sullivan's Island as I  read of the escapades of Susan and her siblings.<br />I don't know when I've  enjoyed a book more. It's the perfect summer read as it has it all:  romance, intrigue, beaches, tragedy and humor galore.  I howled when Susan  walks in unexpectedly one day to her home and catches her 50ish lawyer  husband in bed with with a 23 year old blonde bimbo who runs a new age shop  in town.  It was one of THE funniest sex scenes I've ever read.  (But it's  not the funniest one in the book---there' one even funnier further along!)  Then when she helps him pack his shaving kit and takes his toothbrush and  scrubs it under the rim of the toilet before putting it in his shaving kit,  I thought I would lose it! And she does something EVEN funnier, but I won't  give it all away.  This is a must-read for anyone who wants to escape the  heat of the summer.

Her lyrical writing  brings to mind Alice Hoffman.  The characters have that sort of mystical  quality where you feel as if they all have real souls and you know them  from somewhere. . .  I don't know how else to put it.<br />One of my favorite  quotes that I have copied down in my 'favorite quotes' notebook is by  Hemingway:<br />&quot;All good books are alike in that they are truer than if  they had really happened, and after you are finished reading one, you will  feel that all that happened to you and afterwards it belongs to you: the  good and the bad, the ecstasy, the remorse and sorrow, the people and  places and how the weather was.

Though we might speak of it as extraordinary, it is the most ordinary thing of all.<br />Spirituality is simply a means of arousing one's spirit, of developing a kind of  spiritedness.  Through that we begin to have greater contact with  reality.<br />If we open our eyes, if we open our minds, if we open our  hearts, we will find that this world is a magical place.  It is magical not  because it tricks us or changes unexpectedly into something else, but  because it can *be* so vividly and brilliantly.&quot;  ---Chogyam  Trungpa<br />Everyday life is something that we are all mired in, yet few of  us appreciate.  When was the last time you heard the birds singing outside  your window or were aware of the raindrops as they fell from the sky? Have  you ever bathed in the moonlight of a warm summer night?

I read it over the Memorial Day weekend and it was just what the doctor ordered to rest my brain and escape  reality for a few blissful hours.  The story of Dr. Liam Campbell and  Mikaela Campbell and how a moment of tragedy forever changes their lives  and brings out old secrets and new strengths that they didn't know they  had.  My favorite sentence in the whole book (uttered my Mikaela) which  pretty much sums it all up was:<br />&quot;How do you tell a man that at last  you'd grown up, that you'd learned true love wasn't a night of passionate  sex under a sky lit up by fireworks, but an ordinary Sunday morning when  your husband brought you a glass of water, two aspirins, and heating pad  for your cramps?&quot;<br />The plot was a bit short on substance and I  would like to have seen a few of the characters better developed, but  overall it was an enjoyable book.	2000-05-29

I simply LOVE this book and pick it up every day to read a poem---that's how good it is.  It's turned me on to many new poets and renewed my acquaintances with the old favorites.  I was happy to see this gem on page  278 by Raymond Carver:<br />&quot;And did you get what--- you wanted from this  life, even so?--- I did.--- And what did you want?--- To call myself  beloved, to feel myself--- beloved on the earth.&quot;<br />The power of the  words shine through: the power of words to heal, strengthen, uplift,  comfort, hurt, wound, enrage, succor and rejuvenate!  This book is a  celebration and a joy to read.<br />I enjoyed reading the words to Leonard  Cohen's, &quot;Suzanne Takes You Down&quot;, a favorite song from my past.<br />The poem, &quot;from Jubilate Agno&quot; written by Christopher Smart in  the 1700's while in an insane asylum (about his cat!) was awesome and a  must read for EVERY cat lover.<br />&quot;The Falcon to the Falconer&quot; by  Jonathan Steffen blew me away.  Here's a few lines:<br />&quot;Unleash me from  your hand--- And I will lance the light for you--- I'll cut a swordblade on  the wind--- And pennant it with flight for you--- To signal I am yours---  If you will free me to be true to you. . .&quot;<br />I could go on and on!  I'm so happy that I found this book and recommend it highly!	2000-05-27

I am madly, deeply in lust/love with Dave Robicheaux AND James Lee Burke.  I've lived in the enchanting state of Louisiana my entire life and Burke makes me fall in love with it all over again each time I read one of his  novels set here.  He's a word magician and that's putting it mildly.  For  instance:<br />&quot;Each morning after the sun rose out of the swamp and  burned the fog away, the sky would harden to such a deep heart-wrenching  blue that you felt you could reach up and fill your hand with it like bolls  of stained cotton.  The air was dry and cool, too, and the dust along the  dirt road by the bayou seemed to rise into golden columns of smoke and  light through the canopy of oaks overhead. .&quot;<br />Hell, that's almost  poetry!  And he ain't just all purty words either!  The plots are  intriguing and compelling.  I've read all of his books and feel totally  lost when I've finished the latest Dave Robicheaux adventure.  Keep 'em  coming Mr. Burke!	2000-05-15

I love what she said  on page 102 about paying attention:<br />&quot;To be engrossed by something  outside ourselves is a powerful antidote for the rational mind, the mind  that so frequently()---seeing things in such a  narrow and darkly narcissistic what that it presents a colo-rectal  theology, offering hope to no one.&quot;<br />The entire book is quotable!

A month after joining the swimming pool gang, the work and the heat had burned him down to 210.  Then the next two  months he had built back to 250, all of it pure hard muscle. . . He was  burned a deep brown by the sun and he was in the best shape of his life.  Like a condom crammed with walnuts, is what some girl had said.&quot;<br />I  enjoyed the plot twists which kept me guessing up until Jack took a bullet  for his true love. . . Ah, fiction, where would us girls be without our  big, bad-boy, macho IMAGINARY heros?  Thanks, Lee Child, for another great  Reacher thriller.

I fell into this book head first as it was highly recommended by my best friend.  About halfway through, it just lost all momentum and sputtered to a dead halt.  I wonder if the author was bored with all her money and spare time and decided to become a writer to ease her rich b**ch boredom! To be  fair, there were some good descriptive passages of India, but that's about  all I could say of redeeming value.
