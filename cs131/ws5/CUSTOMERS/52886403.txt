After days of planning, everyone has a wonderful time and a group prize is enjoyed by all--a new member of the family!<br /><br />Chess' text is succinct, but her detailed illustrations carry the book.

Jinnie Ghost, \\"thin as the wind,\\" sweeps from house to house causing the strange night noises and other phenomena known so well by children. The children see her, but Jinnie Ghost \\"doesn't turn her head\\" if she hears them. As she flits through sleeping children's rooms, each child has a fantastic flight of imagination.<br /><br />Doherty's poetical text are a perfect match with Ray's eerie nighttime illustrations. However, Jinnie Ghost is hauntingly real and may be too frightening for toddlers and some preschoolers despite the gentle text. For children wanting some slight shivers, this is a recommended read.	2005-10-01

Wallace Edwards, a respected Canadian illustrator, has used Cox's verses to inspire his own artwork, maintaining an old-fashioned feel with a somewhat more modern design. Children with a sense of the absurd will enjoy Edwards' elaborate illustrations and Cox's short verses in this new edition. The Rhinocerostrich, the Kangarooster, and the Octopussycat are wonderfully ridiculous but strangely plausible with Edwards' presentation.<br /><br />A two page appendix offers a pictorial listing of 32 beasts, from Army Ant to Spider Monkey to Zebrafinch, whose names lead to a more literal vision provided by Edwards.<br /><br />Younger children may find some of the images oddly disturbing, but most will enjoy the zany content hidden behind a facetiously serious facade.	2005-10-01

Books	5	2	2	N	N	New Counting Book	Not the usual type of counting book, this title combines traditional counting activities with a simple \\"I Spy\\" flair on each double page spread.  Each spread features a different scene, from kitchen to playground to bedroom, in which different numbers of animals frolic in fun.  A child in each picture encourages the reader to \\"count the animals and put your finger on the number\\" found in a list on the right side of the page.  Four different types of animals in various numbers appear in each spread, prompting the reader in a column on the left.  Once prereaders are comfortable with the basic mechanics of counting, the book is simple enough to be read alone as a seek and count activity.  Enforcing number concepts playfully, this counting book will have more reading mileage as children become comfortable with counting and number recognition.  Zero, often neglected in counting books, is also introduced.  There might be two sharks in the bathtub, but no octopuses on the towel rail!<br /><br />This book is wonderful for teaching number concept to toddlers and preschoolers, but not recommended for large storytime groups with its interactive format.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-09-14

The book begins by looking at an oasis from a distance and detailing some common desert animals and phenomena as we move closer to the oasis itself.  Once inside the oasis, author and illustrator show the inhabitants of the oasis, from fauna to humans.  Every two page spread contains two concepts detailed in two stanzas and picked up in the illustrations.  Each stanza begins with the phrase \\"This is the place...\\" which becomes wearisome, especially during a read aloud.  The illustrations are colorful and appealing, making up for the text's deficiencies.  The book serves well as a basic introduction to oasis living, but might inspire more questions than it answers. A short glossary at the end of the book expounds upon common desert names and terms, but still doesn't compensate for the slight, strained text of the bulk of the book.	2005-09-14

Jane Yolen and Mark Teague offer us a fifth \\"How Do Dinosaurs,,,?\\" title that is fresh and fun for both parents and children, fortunately back in hardcover format.  Yolen's effortless text is once again perfectly matched with Teague's vivid illustrations of dinosaurs at meal time, first behaving badly and then with grace and charm.  The formula has been proven effective in the previous titles but is far from trite or redundant even the fifth time around thanks to the talents of author and illustrator.  Children also receive a message about manners that is far from didactic or dull, but couched in humor that parents should still enjoy after the umpteenth reading.  Expect to have that umpteenth reading, too, since this one is sure to become a favorite.<br /><br />I just introduced the title to a storytime group and the response was positive.  Children and parents sat quietly, excited to see what the dinosaurs will do next.  This book, like the others in the series, are perfect for large groups or just one on one time between parent and child.<br /><br />Highest recommendation.	2005-09-14

Lila Prap's \\"Why?\\" is a scientifically sound question and answer book disguised as a silly riddle book.  Each two page spread features an animal, a question, and several possible answers.  \\"Why do kangaroos have pouches?\\"  One ludicrous answer is \\"To hide their bellybuttons.\\" The correct answer is marked with a star, always found on the far right of the page.  The rest of the ridiculous answers follow kid logic and some adult logic, especially those adults driven quite mad by a little one's unending \\"Why?\\" questions.  While the illustrations and short text are well-suited to preschoolers, older children will also fully enjoy the book's information and humor.  A nice introductory book to the mysteries of the animal kingdom for ages 4+.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-09-14

Here we have a Zorro firmly planted in his own time, but relevant to our time and sensibilities.  Through Allende's masterful prose, Diego de la Vega, aka Zorro, becomes a hero of flesh and bones, courageous and human. She vividly recreates him and other characters we can believe in.  I found myself able to overshadow the overpowering memories of Antonio Banderas, Tyrone Power and Douglas Fairbanks in the role as I read.  She also describes the landscapes and settings and makes them important characters in their own right. The story is intriguing and hard to set down when other responsibilities beckon you away and back into regular living.<br /><br />More often reinterpreted on the movie screen than in literature, this book, along with a few other recent treatments of Zorro, will hopefully inspire more authors to explore this interesting character, one of the United States' own Robin Hood characters.<br /><br />The novel has wide appeal, literary and well-written for those wanting a richer reading experience while exciting and heroic for those wanting a light summer read.  It's a healthy reading indulgence.	2005-05-11

Those stories might not be as entertaining for the boys who also love fairy tales.  P. W. Catanese now offers a children's novel using the tale of Jack and the Beanstalk, a favorite tale of many children.<br /><br />The hero of this story is Nick, a poor orphan.  Joining a band of thieves for his own survival, Nick ends up meeing Jack of Beanstalk fame.  When he gets a chance to climb the famed beanstalk himself, Nick jumps at the opportunity, little knowing the new dangers that await him up above on the cloud island.  He meets Gullinda, the giantess, and Gnasher, an even scarier giant than the one Jack defeated years ago.  At first, Nick's dream is to become as rich as Jack.  Later he only hopes to get back to his own world alive...<br /><br />Lots of action and suspense as well as thoughts about forgiveness make this a book to be enjoyed by fantasy and fairy tale fans alike.	2005-04-26

The first volume is titled, \\"Beautiful Angiola.\\"<br /><br />Here's my review of the first volume which can be applied to this second volume, too.  After all, Zipes' introduction is only slightly revised from the first to accommodate the second.<br /><br />Here the inexhaustible Jack Zipes edits and translates a lesser known, but arguably very important, collection of Sicilian folk and fairy tales. Originally collected and recorded by Laura Gonzenbach in mid-19th century Sicily, these tales provide a different perspective on the folklore of the time and ours today. Zipes argues that this collection is perhaps the most important collection from the time period, even more important than the Grimms' collection. The tales are unadulterated, carefully recorded to reflect the voice of the original teller. Since Gonzenbach collected primarily from women tellers and was herself female, the feminine perspective of the tales hearkens back to the French Salons albeit at a different class level. Be warned that these tales have not been softened and at times reflect the violence, cruelty, and unfairness of life with clear language; these stories are not for the nursery. Zipes' comprehensive introduction and endnotes (including Aarne-Thompson classification numbers) enhance the scholarly weight of the text, but the stories can be read strictly for the enjoyment of the armchair folklorist.<br /><br />This collection is especially recommended for readers interested in 19th century folktale collections, feminist folklore and Sicily.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-02-01

Despite the legends, the brothers were not itinerant travelers collecting the tales from the German peasantry. (Unfortunately, this legend is soon to be perpetuated to a larger audience by Terry Gilliam's entirely fictional film, The Brothers Grimm.) In reality, the brothers mostly collected the tales from their sister, Lotte, and through her circle of friends and associates.  The brothers then continously edited the tales for several years until we have the versions of Hansel and Gretel, Rumpelstiltskin, Puss in Boots, and many other tales that we know today.<br /><br />Most of this backstory, especially that of the women tellers, has been scattered about in strictly academic works in English and mostly German.  Valerie Paradiz has synthesized this material into one cohesive and highly readable book.  While we have the stories of the women and the changes made to their tales, we also receive a sympathetic view of the two brothers, struggling to support a family hit by several tragedies by doing work they loved and valued.  Neither the brothers' contributions nor those of the women collaborators are diminished.<br /><br />While the book has an academic bent, it works best as general nonfiction and is highly recommended for a much larger audience.  Paradiz's writing style is warm and approachable, making details interesting instead of trivial.  A familiarity with the Grimms' tales is helpful, but not necessary, since she provides enough information about each to support her prose.  Consequently, an interesting slice of German and folklore history is made accessible in a deceptively short book.  Footnotes and a biliography are offered in the back of the book for further reading and research.	2005-01-24

In \\"The Girl Who Married a Lion,\\" Smith retells several stories he has personally collected or received from friends in his beloved African countries, Botswana and Zimbabwe.  To date, most African folklore collections have been scholarly, intended primarily for the armchair or scholarly folklorist, not the general public.  In contrast, these tales are not presented with lots of scholarly notes and histories, but as an end unto themselves.  I would have enjoyed a little more backstory to the tales, but they are presented with a warmth and respect that is often lacking in more scholarly folklore collections.<br /><br />For fans of Smith's bestselling series, the tales offer another view of Precious Ramotswe's world, an intriguing journey into its folklore, blantantly exploited by the publisher with the inclusion of an additional introduction to the collection by the fictional Mma Ramotswe.  While the Ramotswe introduction is charming, it threatens the validity of the collection as a folklore collection, reminding the reader that this collection hopes to capitalize on that series' success.<br /><br />Despite, and even because of all of this, the book is a worthwhile read, presenting deceptively simple stories from an often overlooked part of the world.  Most of the 40 tales have been published previously (see Smith's \\"Children of Wax\\"), but seven of them are unique to this new collection.  Whether you read the book because you are a fan of Mma Ramotswe or because you love folklore, you will not be disappointed as you enjoy the stories of tricksters, animals, and even a cannibal or two.	2004-12-10

Numerous of his illustrations for \\"The Sleeping Beauty,\\" \\"Cinderella,\\" \\"The Real Princess,\\" \\"The Snow Queen,\\" and other classic fairy tales are represented. The illustrations are reproduced on high quality paper. Almost every image is at least 5x7 or 6x8 inches in size and suitable for framing. While I don't usually recommend deconstructing books for their illustrations, this book is well-suited for the purpose and preferable to taking apart an older book for its plates. No fairy tale texts are presented, just the illustrations with their titles and sources. If you are an Edmund Dulac fan, buy one copy to take apart for framing and another one to keep on your bookshelf.	2004-11-11

A. Milne (Winnie-the-Pooh) at his best, but with a charm all his own.  Avon, a snail, decides to go out on an adventure after reading about so many adventures in books.  In the process of leaving, he becomes friends with Edward, an ant, just in time to say good-bye.  After a suitable good-bye--no one likes long good-byes-- Edward catches up with Avon and they continue the adventure together.  Simple logic, whimsical word play, and hidden humor follow them along the way as they experience numerous beginnings and endings.  Their adventures and friendship are quirky and charming, but far from sappy or sweet.  Ultimately, when their journey is finished, they discover that they have only reached the end of the beginning, a wonderful philosophy of life for young and old.<br /><br />Suitable and highly recommended for middle readers and up.  This book also makes a great addition to a personal library since it will hold up to multiple readings thanks to its witty insights into life and living.	2004-11-11

In \\"The Sons of the Dragon King,\\" Ed Young retells and illustrates an ancient Chinese folktale in which a parent, the great Dragon King, struggles with his nine unique children, all sons.  As he hears complaints about his sons from tutors and neighbors, the king realizes his sons are not living lives befitting their royal heritage.  He sets out to chastise each of them, but instead recognizes the talents behind each son's activities and gives them jobs that celebrate and use each talent.  For example, one son becomes the guardian of music, another the servant of justice, and another the protector of food preparation.<br /><br />When the tale is ended, the king is pleased with his sons and they are in turn happy with their assigned roles, continuing in them to this day when they are represented on instruments, doorways, rooftops, etc.<br /><br />The text and illustrations are better suited to older children, third grade and up, but the tale has great potential for reading aloud to slightly younger children.  The tale will also resonate with parents and teachers as the king struggles to nurture his children's gifts and find their places in history.  Overall, a highly recommended version of an ancient tale with modern applications.	2004-11-02

She has previously reinterpreted two other fairy tales with penguins, \\"Cinderella Penguin, Or, the Little Glass Flipper\\" and \\"The Emperor Penguin's New Clothes.\\" In her most recent book, she gives the classic \\"Princess on the Pea\\" a new penguin spin.<br /><br />While Perlman overall stays true to Hans Christian Andersen's tale, she adds some modern twists including an extra night in which the princess sleeps horribly on what mattress covering a cabbage. On the second night she gets the pea and excessive bedding to contend with. While the princess is uncomfortable and detects the pea, her excessive bruising comes from falling out of the high bed.<br /><br />Modern sensibilities will appreciate that in this version the prince falls in love with the princess while playing games, singing, and dancing, not necessarily because she is a true princess. While the penguins are somewhat awkward in the story, they help this version of the classic tale cross ethnic borders and provide whimsical touches to a familiar story.	2004-09-24

In this new collaboration between Yolen and her daughter, Heidi Stemple, seven classic ballet tales are retold and illustrated by Rebecca Guay. All seven tales--Coppelia, Swan Lake, Cinderella, The Nutcracker, Shim Chung, The Sleeping Beauty, and Daphnis and Cloe--are beautifully written, providing vivid details and rich language instead of the more cursory texts provided in similar collections. Short introductions to each ballet, including performance histories and story sources, enriches the collection. The authors also include a brief historical timeline of ballet and a bibliography that references books as well as websites for those who want to learn more about the ballets. Guay's colorful illustrations will appeal to the most romantic dreams of any balletomane, emphasizing the brilliant colors, elaborate costumes and choreography usually associated with the ballets in performance. Overall, a wonderful book for school age children and up either to read or have read to them.	2004-09-16

The book has since gone out of print and has become popular among collectors with some editions selling for well over $100 in the used book market.<br /><br />Now Edens has produced a similar book, \\"Princess Stories,\\" which may become just as sought after by collectors in the years to come.  This time he includes eight tales, including Cinderella, The Frog Prince, The Little Mermaid, The Princess and the Pea, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and Beauty and the Beast.  Edens has included over 150 illustrations to accompany the tales by such masters as Kay Nielsen, Walter Crane, Edmund Dulac, Charles Robinson, W. Heath Robinson, Honor Appleton, Jesse Wilcox Smith, and Arthur Rackham.  More obscure and anonymous illustrations by these illustrators' contemporaries are also included.  Thus results a feast of fairy tale illustrations in color and black and white for all ages.<br /><br />The hardcover book is printed on fine paper and new illustrations appear with every turn of the page.  Readers will enjoy comparing the different visions by the illustrators of the same tales.  The texts are also rich and reflect earlier versions of the tales.  My only regret is that there wasn't room for even more illustrations although plenty are provided here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the cover of the book is deceptive due to its design.  With the last two letters of \\"Princess\\" appearing over the glowing candle, the book appears to be \\"Prince Stories\\" at first glance of the cover.  Never fear, the interior of the book is much better designed with no loss of illustration or textual integrity.	2004-09-10

The book made great armchair reading for anyone slightly interested in the subject.<br />Now Alessandro Levorato has published a more scholarly study of the famous fairy tale in 12 versions published over the past 300 years.  She takes the seldom used linguistics approach to studying the tale, breaking down each tale into word choices and meanings, as well as other nuances of grammar and language usage.  This is not easy reading, but it is meaningful.  Levorato's study is divided into six main sections with a final section summarizing the conclusions drawn from the entire study.  The texts of the twelve versions show how society has changed, especially concerning gender issues.  The book is recommended for anyone interested in any of the primary subjects of fairy tales, linguistics, or gender issues in literature.  It should be made available in any reputable university library, too.<br />For anyone wondering which versions of the tale are analyzed, here is a list of the authors and titles:<br />1. Oral version: 'The Story of Grandmother' (l5th-l6th c., French)<br />2. J. Perrault: 'Little Red Riding Hood' (1697, French)<br />3. Brothers Grimm: 'Little Red Cap' (1812, German)<br />4.

Her parents, scientists at heart, decide to send her to school despite the risk of Prudence learning ideas outside their own values of science over fiction.  The debate that Prudence experiences, with her teacher and within herself, is lighthearted but has serious undertones.  What does a child do when her teacher's values are different from those of her parents?  What does she believe?  A little trickery on the part of the teacher pushes Prudence to find an answer.<br />While the story has a good heart, the book borders on ineffective didacticism for adults instead of an entertaining story for all ages, promoting Einstein's theory that fairy tales in his childhood fed his imagination and genius. Still, young children will enjoy the fun illustrations and Prudence's desire for a sibling.  There are enough fairy tale allusions to entertain the fairy tale savvy crowd, whatever age.  It's cute, and even fun in some places, but Prudence Proovit isn't destined to be a classic.	2004-06-04

While the original duckling story offers some suspense, this story will be obvious to all but the very youngest of children.<br />A small airplane is somehow born to a family of trucks and fails to fit in while the rest of the family performs truck-like activities, like hauling loads.  Obviously, we as readers know that the \\"ugly truckling\\" isn't a truck, but a plane, as evidenced by the illustrations.  All we have to do is watch the plane ask other machinery, like a tractor and windmill, what it is.  Finally, the little plane looks up and knows where it belongs when it sees a group of planes flying overhead.  It then happily flies away into the sunset.  Children with a love for trucks, planes and other machinery will likely adore this simple story that accommodates a toddler's short attention span.  Children may also like predicting the story's solution on the first page as they recognize the plane.  The illustrations are bright and convey the wide open space of the prairie.<br />Overall, a sweet and simple story recommended for the toddler and preschool sets.  Older children will be bored.	2004-06-04

Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' books also come to mind.  While this book has not received the same amount of press as the other authors, hopefully more readers will also find this gem.<br />Gribben's Fairytale is suitable for middle readers and up.  Here we have an adventure story about a young woman engaged to marry against her own desires for her life, a common and popular theme but presented through Gribben's imagination.  While Gribben's style lacks full maturity, she writes a story that entertains and uses many of the popular fairy tale themes fantasy lovers adore, from enchanted frogs and scary dragons to the fight between good and evil.<br />This book makes fine reading for a lazy afternoon for your child or even yourself!	2004-03-23

Unfortunately, many reviews are being published for that title under this newer book.  This review is for the book by Geras, illustrated by Christian Birmingham, and with the ISBN number of 043958180X.<br />If you love blue and white, this Sleeping Beauty will quickly become your favorite version ever.  Birmingham uses the entire spectrum of blue for his lush and luminescent illustrations of Geras' adaptation of the well-known fairy tale.  While Geras' text is excellent, Birmingham's illustrations are the true reason for owning this book.  Every page glows with light and magic, providing an impact similar to Thomas Kinkade's paintings without the blatant sweetness. Even at the darkest moments of the story, the happy ending is foreshadowed with beams of light streaming into the image.<br />Kinuko Y. Craft most recently illustrated this tale with a rich palette of reds and earth tones.  Now Birmingham has provided us with the opposite spectrum of cool blues and the sky.  Both books are highly recommended; don't think that this one should be missed if you already own Craft's beautiful book.  We can only hope Geras and Birmingham will produce more fairy tales with their unique vision.	2004-03-23

The illustrations are reproduced on high quality paper.  Almost every image is at least 5x7 or 6x8 inches in size and suitable for framing.  While I don't usually recommend deconstructing books for their illustrations, this book is well-suited for the purpose and preferable to taking apart an older book for its plates.  No fairy tales are presented, just the illustrations with their titles and sources.  If you are a Rackham fan, buy one copy to take apart for framing and another one to keep on your bookshelf.  Most of these illustrations are not available in any size for art prints.  Many of the illustrations are not available in print in any other source at this time except for the original antique books in which they appeared.	2004-02-06

Editor Jack Zipes compiled the book with such a purpose in mind and it's a job well done.  The largest section, The Texts of the Great Fairy Tale Tradition, is comprised of fairy tale texts grouped into over 35 themes.  Examples of themes include: Love Conquers All, Abandoned Children, Shrewd Cats, and Envious Sisters. Each theme has a minimum of two tales--usually more--with an introduction explaining the history of the theme and its tales.  Zipes' introduction includes a definition of the literary fairy tale and its history as a genre.  Critical essays by respected scholars are included in the Criticism section.  Short biographies of the authors, black and white illustrations, and a selected bibliography add to the resources found inside.  My only wish is that an index to aid with finding and cross-referencing tales had been included.  This book makes a great reference book or textbook for the armchair scholar at an affordable price.	2003-12-04

As any folklorist knows, similar story threads exist across cultures and time. Why does this happen?  One influence may have been the classic mythology from the Greeks and Romans.  Graham Anderson makes reasonable connections between classical literature and our more modern folklore in previously unexplored ways.  His writing is concise with easy-to-follow descriptions and analysis.  If you are interested in the history of story, folklore, or the classics, this book is an excellent and relatively quick read. I only wish I had owned this book in the days when I was studying the classics as an undergraduate.  It would have made reading the classics even more interesting than it was then.	2003-12-04

Originally collected and recorded by Laura Gonzenbach in mid-19th century Sicily, these tales provide a different perspective on the folklore of the time and ours today.  Zipes argues that this collection is perhaps the most important collection from the time period, even more important than the Grimms' collection.  The tales are unadulterated, carefully recorded to reflect the voice of the original teller. Since Gonzenbach collected primarily from women tellers and was herself female, the feminine perspective of the tales hearkens back to the French Salons albeit at a different class level. Be warned that these tales have not been softened and at times reflect the violence, cruelty, and unfairness of life with clear language; these stories are not for the nursery. Zipes' comprehensive introduction and endnotes (including Aarne-Thompson classification numbers) enhance the scholarly weight of the text, but the stories can be read strictly for the enjoyment of the armchair folklorist.<br />This collection is especially recommended for readers interested in 19th century folktale collections, feminist folklore and Sicily.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-11-24

She is eventually sent to marry a prince in a different kingdom, but along the way is overthrown by her lady-in-waiting.  Ani becomes a servant, tending geese, while she searches for a way to return to the marriage and throne that is rightfully her own.<br />Hale has reimagined the story in such a way as to give us a strong, if flawed, heroine with a conscience.  In this book, the reader isn't left wondering how a princess could allow herself to be displaced so easily from her birthright.  We are also given a magical reason for Ani's successful sojourn with geese.  Ultimately, Hale's prose is the book's greatest asset.  Ani and her world are vivid creations, ready to be shared during a long, quiet read.<br />If you enjoy fairy tale novelizations, such as those by Robin McKinley and Donna Jo Napoli, this book will make a great addition to your bookshelf.  If you simply like historical fantasy, forget the fairy tale, this novel will also please.  Royalty, deception, intrigue, treason, and redemption make up a story that doesn't obviously derive from a fairy tale.	2003-10-13

Hours later, I found I had stayed up too late and finished the book, wanting more, more, more.  The book is well-written, well-plotted, and completely engrossing.  In 1868 Boston, Nell Sweeney, a governess, tries to help a man accused of murder by learning if he really committed the crime or is only covering up for someone else.  To tell you anymore would deprive you of a wonderful journey.<br />I was kept guessing along with Nell Sweeney as the investigation progressed.  Usually paperback mystery series start out fine and either improve over several volumes and/or eventually fade away.  This book is stunning and I hope the series continues.  I have to know what and who will enter Nell's life next.<br />I highly recommend this book.  Buy it.  Own it.  Before it goes out of print.  This is a wonderful book and you will want to share it with your friends and even reread it yourself.	2003-10-12

I was finished with the series, but we all know how searching for something new on the bookstore shelves sometimes leads to desperate purchases.  I bought this third book with much trepidation.  I took it home.  I read it.  I actually enjoyed it.  The characters are becoming three-dimensional.  The mystery was more interesting.  The romance is more apparent, but still subtle.  A historical figure--Florence Nightingale--makes an appearance.  It is a decent cozy, if you are looking for a book to distract you for a few hours.  I will keep this one on my shelves and wait for the fourth book to see what Dr. Alexandra will do next.	2003-10-11

While \\"Chapel Noir\\" and \\"Castle Rouge\\" were darker in tone and took some narrative away from Nell Huxleigh, \\"Femme Fatale\\" returns Nell back to Irene's side for a new adventure.  Nellie Bly still gets some air time, but she is no longer a threat to Nell's place in the world, at least with Irene.<br />In this book, we learn more about Irene's past and see parts of New York in its glorious past, from Delmonico's to Coney Island.  Oh, Sherlock Holmes returns and a new mystery comes forward to trouble our heroines, too. While the mystery and atmosphere are wonderful in this new installment, the characters are the driving force.  Secret pasts, loyalty, intelligence and a little bit of love all together make this a pleasurable read.<br />Never fear that while Godfrey and Quentin are absent for most of the book, Quentin does make a grand and quite satisfying appearance.  Also, be warned that while the primary mystery in this novel is resolved, we are left with a semi-cliffhanger which is only a delicious promise that we will see more of these characters in the near future.	2003-10-10

Beaumont and Carlson have gathered numerous poems from a wide range of poets that reflect the enduring themes and characters we inherited through the work of the Brothers Grimm.  The usual suspects, such as Anne Sexton, are here but so are some lesser known poets.  The anthology is strong and represents many well-known fairy tales along with a few that are lesser known by the general public.  The book is recommended for libraries and classrooms in which poetry and/or fairy tales are taught. It also makes great armchair reading for anyone interested in new interpretations of familiar stories.	2003-09-17

I was wrong.  Within the first few pages, I found myself laughing and hating to put the book down to finish my work.  I couldn't wait to have the chance to sit down and finish it.  Yes, it is a twisted fairy tale with the cliche of an ugly princess, but there the comparisons end.  Gray has managed to write her material fresh, silly, and downright funny.  Rose is a third princess with buck teeth and awful hair.  Her older sisters, Concrete and Asphalt, have to wait for hours each day while their hair is groomed and maintained to perfection. They don't mind since their younger sister's ugliness has not required them to fly off and become wicked, bitter ugly witches!  Rose's adventures and lessons learned about wishes and beauty are obvious, but still entertaining, so readers won't mind getting a message with their fun.  This would be a cute book for a classroom read aloud or for any girl looking for a new fairy tale chapter book.<br />Also recommended are:  The Ordinary Princess by M. M. Kaye and the fairy tale books of Gail Carson Levine	2002-10-10

Duck decides to ride a bike for the fun of it and greets the animal on the farm as he passes by.  It might sound trite, but in this book, it is all magical.<br />The full bleed illustrations are bright and colorful while the story is humorous and engaging. Don't miss the last page either.  All the kids love it. This has become my favorite picture book this year and I will be disappointed if it doesn't receive a Caldecott nod.

The tale is romantic and Kinuko Craft's illustrations are her usual high standard, this time with a baroque whimsy that will delight young and old readers.  I have seen grown-ups reaching to thumb through the book as often as the children in my library and at the bookstore.  If you are not familiar with Craft's illustrations, this book is a perfect introduction while presenting a fairy tale princess in all of her baroque splendor.

It is the frame story from the Arabian Nights in which a woman tells stories each night and never finishes them before dawn in hopes of living another day.  For if she doesn't give her husband, the king, a reason to extend her life, she will be executed at dawn.  The next night she finishes the story from the previous night and then begins another.<br />In Dokey's version of the story, Shahrazad is blind and brave.  She has learned to see with her heart and knows that the king has been deeply wounded by his first wife who betrayed him.  As she helps the king heal through her stories, they both learn how to forgive, trust, and love each other.  However, other forces are also seeking to destroy them and gain the throne.  How the story ends is different from the original tale, but should prove satisfying to most readers.  The romance in the story is not heavy-handed nor the only theme of the book.  This should appeal to those who love a romance or simply a historical adventure.<br />This paperback appears to be the first in a series of fairy tale retellings with a \\"Once Upon a Time\\" theme.  \\"Storyteller's Daughter\\" is the first, soon to be followed by \\"Beauty Sleep,\\" also by Cameron Dokey.  Then \\"Snow\\" by Tracy Lynn will follow later.<br />Another great book to read as a companion to this one is \\"Shadow Spinner\\" by Susan Fletcher.	2002-09-02

Almost two hours later, I turned to the last page and discovered I was tired but invigorated.  My intention was to read the book so I could book talk it to the youth and other librarians at the library where I work.  I was rewarded with so much more than some simple professional reading.<br />The book is set in present day India, although I constantly had to remind myself of this.  I kept feeling the book was about women in India a hundred years ago. It's not. Computers, air conditioning, cars, and other amenities are referred to, although they are not in Koly's realm of experience most of the time.<br />&quot;Homeless Bird&quot; does not have to be read with a social consciousness.  It is a solid story about a young woman with a talent for embroidery and sad family situations.  She continues to survive at times when I might have been tempted to give up.  The story is an much an inspiration as it is an education.  I will not summarize the story again since many of the reviews already do.  Read this book for Koly, for the view of another world, for the vividness of a life much different from mine, and most likely yours.<br />I am recommending this book to daughters, mothers, and anyone interested in India.  Whelan's tone is not one of judgment, but one of matter-of-factness.  This book is real although it is set in fiction. Koly lives and breathes in your head even if she never really existed, but thousands of women like her have.  Read the book for those women who have struggled and are still struggling to live happily in a system that undermines their attempts.	2002-01-07

I have read hundreds of them.  Some are much better than others.  This is one of the better ones.<br />Gabby sounds and acts real.  She and her friends talk like preteens.  They all have problems and they are all struggling to understand themselves and sometimes each other.  Gabby is sympathetic without being pathetic.  Gabby knows loneliness, but she also knows love and friendship.  She has been an outcast and she struggles to understand why she is on the outside, thinking it is because she is motherless.  She learns that her mother's death and absence are a critical part of her emotional make-up, but not the only reasons for her problems.  The other kids around her have problems, too. Problems are a fact in any life.<br />Baskin has written an emotionally reachable book without sinking into pathos.  The characters don't want to be pitied, not even Gabby at her worst moments.  They just want to be understood.<br />This book is a great read and I will be very surprised if it doesn't get some recognition from various medal-awarding groups.  I am wholeheartedly promoting it to the kids in my local library.<br />If you like Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's &quot;Alice&quot; series, you will definitely like this book.	2002-01-07

The story is a happy one--albeit an unusual and a little farfetched.  We learn about the process of getting a book published and promoted.  We learn about the private motivations for reading and publishing a book.  We get to have fun becoming friends with two wonderful characters, Zoe and Natalie.  Some would argue that they accomplish the impossible.  But every new book published by a new author is a miracle, so why not have fun and believe in this story?<br />Natalie writes a book, \\"The Cheater,\\" which you will want to read yourself before the book is over.  Unfortunately, you won't get to unless Clements provides that story for us someday. Zoe, an unusually spunky preteen, is determined to get the book published.  She thinks the book is great and she wants to help her friend heal from the death of Natalie's father.  These are intelligent preteens who still act like preteens.  Nothing is impossible, if you try hard enough and have the talent.<br />Read and have fun.  If you have ever wondered how books get published or want to be published yourself someday, this book gives a great overview of the process, too.

Books	3	14	17	N	N	A difficult but tantalizing read	I have eagerly anticipated another Irene Adler book from Carole Nelson Douglas for several years now.  I learned about &quot;Chapel Noir&quot; several months ago and eagerly rushed to the bookstore as soon as my copy arrived in the store.  That said, I can admit I am a fan, albeit a slightly disappointed one.<br />No, I do not mind that the book is darker than the previous ones in the series.  It fits the story.  I love the growth and development of the characteters, so no complaints there.  I can even handle a cliffhanger as much as I personally detest them.  I hate waiting at least a year for a resolution in books I read primarily for entertainment.<br />What I didn't like was the constant change of narrator in the book.  Yes, I understand it was necessary, considering the inevitable cliffhanger.  Yes, I even like Pink (or whatever you want to call her).  But although she is vastly different in personality from Nell, her narrative voice is not sufficiently different.  I kept having to keep the narrative clues straight as to who was speaking, since the voices were all too similar.  It's not that I was confused, but I had to work too hard to read the book just to keep the narrators straight, let alone the clues and story developments.  It was horrific when I had to put the book down for a break and come back and figure out who was speaking before I could become immersed in the story.  The narrative clues are dense, actually, and also slowed the flow of the story.  It was as if the editor knew the voices were not different enough so we were peppered with narrative clues, not mystery clues, since the conceit had to be maintained to obtain the ending.<br />Still, Irene is back, and so is Nell.  If you love them, reread the other books and venture onto this one.  If you haven't read the former books, please start with them.  Nell is a jewel, a Dr. Watson and an Archie Goodwin rolled all into a Victorian woman.  Don't miss her.  I love her.  I just wish the book had been more about her again than Irene.  Irene is wonderful, but Nell is the true heroine.  Nell humanizes Irene's perfections.<br />If you also enjoy Holmes tempered with a strong female character, I highly recommend Laurie R.

The books remind me of Judy Blume's &quot;Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing&quot; and &quot;Superfudge&quot; which chronicle another oldest child's trials and tribulations with younger siblings. The love, although exasperated, is apparent in Charlie and Lola's relationship. I highly recommend both Charlie and Lola books.	2001-09-06

The illustrations are bright, colorful and charming for reading aloud or simply browsing. Children are reminded that it's okay to be different, no matter what their differences or similarities. While tolerance of others is one of the themes, self-acceptance is the most important message. This is a great book for showing that differences are perfectly fine and acceptable. The book does not reek of politically correct messages as much as it comforts us that being different is just fine. I, as an adult, liked myself a little better after I read it the first time. I think children will feel the same way.<br />A friend of mine took the book to read at her local children's hospital where it was a big hit with the patients who often feel very different.  This is a must for any library, big or small.	2001-09-06

If you are interested in reading many successful authors' thoughts on the power of story and reading, this book is a must.  The essays in this collection are inspiring, diverse, and unified in their passion for writing and storytelling.  I found myself returning to passages over and over, savoring the passions for children's literature that are similar to my own.  A stellar collection of authors are presented including Susan Cooper, Madeleine L'Engle, Maurice Sendak and many more that appear on most required reading lists.  (They are listed entirely in the professional reviews above.)  This is a great book for librarians, teachers, students, and anyone who loves one or all of the many authors represented.	2001-07-15

This book meets my needs with large, colorful pictures and simple text.  The traditional story is presented although the bears are far from frightening for little children.  The bears are the sympathetic characters, especially with their amusement at Goldilock's invasion of their home and their familiar clothing. Gorbachev's illustrations have many fun details, including views of the bears on their family outing through various windows of the house.  The book will entertain children-and hopefully adults-- through several rereadings.	2001-07-14

Letters are often considered a lost art now, but this book shows what letter writing is like to younger children.  The most fun, however, comes from the illustrations that enhance the information provided in each letter.<br />The book is most likely too complicated for 3 and under, but older children should enjoy the interaction of the characters and the story development.  The book gets better with its second and third reads.  What child doesn't want to hear it read more than once anyway?	2001-07-11

Of course, her wish comes true and she is washed overboard the ship she is sailing on to meet her betrothed.  Soon she finds herself competing to tell a story with an ending a prince cannot predict.  The story is entertaining, albeit predictable for adults, and provides positive role models for children.  The power of story is shown as the princess and the prince hopefully live happily ever after with lots of great stories to share.<br />The illustrations are particularly beautiful and romantic without sappiness.  The book should be well received by the younger set who are tired of their traditional fairy tales and want a new story to read.	2001-07-11

Any new book from Elizabeth Peters is always a much anticipated purchase for me. &quot;Lord of the Silent&quot; is a joy after a long year without news about Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, Nefret, and company.  I have been reading this series for years and somehow the last few books have only strengthened my love for these characters.  This time the characters behave more like themselves, romance reigns, and adventure is always awaiting you on the next page.<br />&quot;Lord of the Silent&quot; takes place during the height of WWI.  The fear of submarines and air attacks are present.  The intrigue of spywork keeps everyone busy with secrets.  Archaelogy and love for the past, as well as family and friends, are the unifying threads throughout the book.<br />Yes, Ramses and Nefret are finally married.  Yes, Ramses is prone to intrigue and suspense, albeit reluctantly, with a family never far behind him.  Yes, Amelia's observations of her world are entertaining.  It's all here.  And, yes, that other man in Amelia's life does make some appearances with some new developments in their relationship.  Big revelations took place in the last book, &quot;He Shall Thunder in the Sky,&quot; and now everyone has to readjust to the new dynamics.<br />I myself enjoyed the new dynamics of Ramses and Nefret's relationship.  They have learned about communication and love from wonderful parents and the lessons come out in their new adventures.  Romance doesn't disappear just because a wedding has taken place!  It never left Amelia and Emerson and it's not leaving the next generation either.<br />The plot is good, too, but the characters are what always bring me back for more.  I would try to describe it, but why spoil the story for you?  Snuggle up in your favorite nook or go to the pool with this new book and plan to stay awake for a long, fun, entertaining read.	2001-05-02

Now the pigs get their own book and we can all be grateful for this new adventure.<br />At first, this book appears to be a beautifully illustrated retelling of the fairy tale classic, &quot;The Three Little Pigs.&quot;  But when the wolf blows one of the pigs out of the story, we quickly join the pigs on an unusual journey in which pigs fly, a cow jumps over the moon, and a dragon becomes a pig's best friend.  The story is not predictable and the clever illustrations will require many rereadings to catch all of their nuances.<br />Wiesner's humor and gorgeous art will entertain children and any adult lucky enough to join in on the fun.  This book will also make a great companion to another fractured fairy tale, Jon Scieszka's &quot;The True Story of the Three Little Pigs.&quot;	2001-04-08

Adult readers will remember that the world looks different when you have the height of a child.  Children will enjoy Paparone's brightly colored illustrations that make the world a happy place to look at.  Nothing exciting happens except for the wonder of seeing the world and celebrating its many sights.  This is a great read for a quiet time or bedtime when a peaceful, soothing text is wanted.  However, some of the images and words may require explaining, especially the appearance of a milkman.	2001-04-08

The pieces are sturdy enough under adult supervision, but they won't last forever under the use of little hands.  Still, the book has a charming storyline and the removable monkeys make the counting theme of the book fun and easier to understand.  The book will probably be a favorite as your child learns to count.<br />This book's interactive format will make it impossible for inclusion into library collections, so you will have to buy it if you want to share it with your child.	2001-04-08

Children will love the refrain, &quot;It's simple.&quot;  They will also love Simon who shows wit and bravery when life gets a little scary.  So's illustrations are magical but simple enough to match the tone of the story.  Hoberman's text is fun to read out loud to a group.  This would be a great new book for story time.	2001-04-08

The adventures are fun, but simplified, to allow for the many scenes along Monkey's journey.<br />Although this book is intriguing, it is problematic for sharing with younger readers.  The story is complex with many different scenes and characters that may confuse the under five set.  The vocabulary is complex and the story is long.  However, the book serves as an excellent introductory piece to the Monkey King, a beloved trickster from folklore.  Young gives some helpful notes about the characters and Monkey's adventures from the epic &quot;The Journey to the West.&quot;  In the end, the book leaves you hungering for more stories about Monkey.	2001-04-08

Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow are important books for me so it is hard to be critical of this new installment.  However, this book is much more accessible than some of the other Ender sequels and is a great continuation of Ender's Shadow.  Bean is far from normal and he makes an interesting character to follow.<br />Without giving any spoilers, it is great to finally read about Peter and the events on Earth after Ender's departure.  Of course, the other books set in this universe have referred to some of the events that occur, but now knowing the story behind them is much more satisfying.<br />If you are not familiar with the Ender series, please do not start with this book.  Ender's Game should be read first for the pure joy of it.  Then read Ender's Shadow and finally this book.  You won't regret it.  I have recommended Ender's Game over and over for more than a decade and have never had a negative response.	2001-01-02

I think I finally found it.  While much of the information in this book is not new, it has been conveniently gathered from several sources to help teachers find the information they need when teaching units in this area of their curriculum. Fairy tales offer many avenues of study in the classroom and this book will simplify writing lesson plans.  Ways to think about the tales are presented as well as interpretations to use for different applications.<br />For anyone else who is interested in folklore, this is a wonderful resource for jumping off your studies.  I learned new things and remembered other things I had forgotten!	2000-11-01

This is Jennifer Niven's first book, but we can only hope it will not be her last.  This is the tale of a fateful voyage from which only some people returned.  Niven has carefully researched her story and presents facts and excerpts from diaries while still giving you the feel of a great novel.  Her prose is lovely and the story is spectacular.  It's books like these that prove that life is stranger and more wondrous than fiction.  This book rivals the story of Titanic in intensity and tragedy.  Surely a movie is not far behind.	2000-11-01

It is one of the best versions since Edmund Dulac's classic illustrations.  In fact, I don't have many favorite versions that have been published in the last fifty years. This is the version of Sleeping Beauty that I prefer to keep on my shelf for reading to children. The characters appear real and magical all at once.  Hyman is a Caldecott award winning illustrator.  This book is another example of why she is so honored.	2000-10-29

The illustrations did not remind me of Leonardo Da Vinci.  I was ready to be disappointed.  Instead, I was surprised when I found myself enjoying the book.  I like the portrayal of Leonardo and his apprentice.  The genius of the man is portrayed while still keeping him imperfect.  Leonardo doesn't have answers for all of life's questions.  Still, the book reminded me how fascinating math and science can be while reminding me why the Renaissance is such a fascinating time in history.  All around, this is a wonderful book.	2000-10-14

I hate to say more in fear of spoiling the story.  However, this is a book which gave me serenity.  I may even have to reread it on one of those nights when I feel a little afraid of the darkness.  I felt serene when the book was finished and the illustrations glow as if the candles were real.  What more can I say?<br />Oh, here is also a description of the book from the publisher:<br />&quot;As night comes, everyone in the village falls asleep. Everyone, that is, except the candlemaker, who is responsible for keeping the flame of life burning through the hours of darkness - but his task is not an easy one. For while he works, \\"Night\\" comes creeping through the streets and slides under the door of his workshop, whispering fearful threats.

This is a unique collection of stories within a story from a different culture--an Islamic one.  The Shah Bahram is wealthy but not happy.  He is fascinated with the portraits of seven princesses whom he invites to come live in his kingdom in their own pavillions (beautifully portrayed in the illustrations).  Each princess proceeds to tell the shah a story in which seven virtues--truth, patience, perseverance, forgiveness, humility, wisdom, and love--are expounded upon. The shah learns and so do we.  There have been an abundance of princess stories and collections in recent years, but this one is unique.  I highly recommend it.	2000-10-14

The wait is over and I am thrilled with this book.  Napoli, who has already wooed me with her gems, The Magic Circle and Zel, explores my favorite fairy tale--Beauty and the Beast--in a new and interesting way.<br />The tale is given to us through the Beast's point of view and begins before the point when the tale usually starts.  The Beast struggles with his transformation from human to animal.  He seeks beauty and not just in the form of a woman to save him.  I do not want to say more and ruin the story.  Napoli, a linguist, provides us with not only a beautiful story, but with a book rich with language, although the Beast is deprived of speech. We are also given the opportunity to learn more about Persian and Islamic culture since the Beast is a Persian prince.<br />This book makes a wonderful companion to Robin McKinley's &quot;Beauty&quot; and &quot;Rose Daughter,&quot; two other Beauty and the Beast novels for fairy tale fans.	2000-10-12

Batt has gathered several folktales from around the world with the theme of fabric and/or weaving.  Griffin has done a marvelous job of using fabrics to illustrate the tales while reflecting the culture of each.  This is a charming book with new tales and illustrations to share with children and adults alike.  The fabrics are all vibrantly colored, making the illustrations a feast for the eyes.  I kept finding new details every time I looked at a page.  Each story is prefaced with an introduction about the fabric which will appear in the story.  This would make a perfect gift for people interested in folklore or in weaving.<br />Here is also a brief description from the publisher:<br />&quot;The weaving of words and the weaving of fabrics come together in this exceptional gift book, which combines the talents of professional storyteller Tanya Batt and textile artist Rachel Griffin. The history and passage around the world of each of the fabrics, from wool to batik, from flax to silk, is fascinatingly described, and the fabrics themselves then become the central characters of stories from areas as diverse as Scandinavia, Hawaii, Indonesia, and East Africa.&quot;	2000-10-12

I have read countless versions of Cinderella and looked at numerous illustrations.  I have never seen the story treated like this.  Innocenti sets Cinderella in the 1920s with flapper clothes and cars (instead of a pumpkin carriage).  Never fear, a glass slipper is still here.  I am usually tired of Cinderella books, to be honest, but this one kept me turning pages to see what was going to happen.  I have become selective in my Cinderella purchases, but I had to own this one.<br />The ISBN for the Roberto Innocenti version is 1568461305.

Little Gold Star is a Spanish American fairy tale similar to Cinderella.  However, the role of fairy godmother is filled by Blessed Mary, showing the traditional Catholic influence in this culture.  San Souci is always wonderful with words, but Martinez gives the story a serene beauty with his illustrations.  The book has a peaceful feeling with its subdued tones.

While their experiences can  be brutal, the heroines triumph and give hope to their readers.  Be warned  that these are not the gentler stories of Robin McKinley and Gail Carson  Levine.

The text on every page is also framed  with themed-backgrounds.  Middle and older readers will appreciate  these new illustrations and texts.<br />The tales in the book are some of the most popular without any obscure tales to add diversity.  The tales are:  Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty in the Forest, Rumpelstiltskin,  Rapunzel, Snow White, Aladdin and the Enchanted Lamp, Little Red Riding  Hood, The Fire-Bird, Hansel and Gretel, Frog Prince, and The Wild Swans.	2000-09-05

This book, long  and filled with multiple subplots, is classic Tom Clancy.  Of course,  Clancy's books are not literature at its best, but they are thrilling reads  with some food for thought about politics, the military, world relations,  and various other topics.<br />If you have read and enjoyed the previous  books that feature Jack Ryan, you will be happy with this new installment.  Favorite characters from previous books are back. Once again, Clancy's  forays into many topics provide great inspiration for thinking about the  presidency and politics, especially in an election year (even if you do not  always agree with Clancy's personal politics).<br />This is a fun read.  While  some of Clancy's early books are tighter and better reads, this one will  satisfy hungry fans.	2000-08-23

Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling are best known for their many editorial collaborations on collections of short stories for adults. This collection, however, is acceptable to a wider and younger audience.<br />My  favorite tales in the collection are by Katherine Vaz, Delia Sherman, and  Patricia McKillip.  All of the tales are wonderful and will expand readers'  thinking about fairy tales and their presence in the modern world.  A few  of the tales are romantic and one by Garth Nix is gruesome.  There are  stories to fit all tastes.  Each one is a jewel and my only regret is that  more stories are not included.  This collection is all too short.<br />The  stories in the book are:  The Months of Manhattan / Delia Sherman -- Cinder  Elephant / Jane Yolen -- Instructions / Neil Gaiman -- Mrs. Big / Michael  Cadnum -- Falada / Nancy Farmer -- A Wolf at the door / Tanith Lee -- Ali  Baba and the Forty Aliens / Janeen Webb -- Swans / Kelly Link -- The  Kingdom of Melting Glances / Katherine Vaz -- Hansel's Eyes / Garth Nix --  Becoming Charise / Kathe Koja -- The Seven Stage a Comeback / Gregory  Maguire -- The Twelve Dancing Princesses / Patricia A. McKillip<br />Young  adult readers who enjoy this book may also like \\"Tales from the  Brothers Grimm and the Sisters Weird\\" by Vivian Vande Velde,  \\"Teller of Tales\\" by William Brooke and \\"Truly Grimm  Tales\\" by Priscilla Galloway.	2000-06-14

In the book, Yolen offers her insights into  children's literature, fairy tales, folklore, and storytelling.  Her book  is a must-read for anyone who loves stories, children, and folklore.  Many  children today never hear fairy tales beyond the cinematic offerings of  Disney.  Yolen explains why children (and adults) need to hear these  stories to increase their understanding of themselves and their world.	2000-05-11

Her growth as a writer is evident in her new tome, &quot;Spindle's End.&quot;  McKinley leaves behind  Beauty and the Beast, which she has developed in two novels, to explore the  Sleeping Beauty fairy tale.  The story developments are surprising at times  but work well in her original treatment.  The famous kiss which appears in  the most popular versions of the tale is presented here with a new twist.  The characters are charming and quirky.  I was sorry when the book reached  its conclusion and Rosie's story ended.<br />McKinley has returned to the  lighter touch evident in &quot;Beauty&quot; so this book can be recommended  to readers of all ages.  Books from McKinley are often years in the waiting  for her fans.  This book was well worth the wait.  For a completely  different treatment of the same tale, I also recommend Jane Yolen's  &quot;Briar Rose.&quot;	2000-05-05

Like Rapunzel, she is held captive by the witch after being taken from her mother.  Petrosinella, however, uses her wits to escape her captor and live happily ever after.  This story originally appeared in Giambattista Basile's Il Pentamerone almost 400 years ago.  The illustrations are beautiful and reflect both today's tastes as well as the age of the story.  I recommend this book for anyone looking for an old twist on a tale that is more exciting than the one we are most familiar with.  END	2000-05-05

Yolen, as always, tells the story for young and old so all may enjoy it.  Nolan's illustrations help me understand why Icarus wants to fly so high into the beautiful sky.  I recommend this book  for anyone wanting a good story, especially if you are fascinated by  mythology.	2000-05-02

I rushed to buy the book and couldn't wait to start reading it.  Everyone who has read the previous books in this series will thoroughly enjoy this new and thrilling installment.  I did and now I have to read it again more slowly since I  rushed through it the first time.<br />If you have never read any of the  Amelia Peabody books, buy this one but don't read it first.  It is more fun  to start at least with the first book featuring the adult Ramses, Seeing A  Large Cat.  Although I recommend getting to know his parents first in the  first book of the series, Crocodile on the Sandbank.  Why would you want to  deny yourself some of the best summer reading available?  These books offer  adventure, romance, intrigue, mystery and some educational material about  both Egyptology and the Victorian Age.  You get to learn while enjoying a  great read.	2000-05-02

With a focus on the European Fairy Tale tradition, this volume includes entries on authors, illustrators, playrights, critical movements, collectors, films, and countless others related to the fairy tale genre.  The entries are well-researched and many are enhanced with rarely reproduced illustrations.

While some expected entries are missing, this is still the best reference volume in the field.  It is highly recommended.	2000-04-19

One must always take notice of any new work by Jane Yolen, especially someone like me who adores fairy tales.  This collection of tales expands one of the most commonly explored themes in fairy tales--mother and  daughter relationships.  Yolen and Stemple include tales that present the  dark relationships and the wonderful ones between mother and daughter.  I  recommend this book to anyone who is exploring this theme whether or not  they are avidly interested in folklore.  These tales present this  relationship from various cultures and times that will inspire thought and  discussion.  Plus, it will just be fun to read with your mother or  daughter.	2000-04-16

The amazing Jane Yolen edited this collection of tales that are often overlooked or forgotten.  The tales, as the title implies, focus on older characters instead of the younger ones we often read about in Cinderella  and Sleeping Beauty.  Yolen has collected tales that will be of interest to any reader  looking for a different focus when reading fairy tales and folklore.  The  multicultural sources emphasize the presence of elder characters  around the world.  This book would be particularly great as a gift to a parent, grandparent or other person who first read you a fairy tale as a  child.	2000-04-04

In the introduction, we are told that Strauss and Browne met at a conference and discovered both were interpreting fairy tales through their individual  muses--she through words and he with images.  This book is the result of  their work. The interpretations are wise and insightful from both artists.  This book came after Wolfgang Mieder's &quot;Disenchantments,&quot;  otherwise I am sure several of these poems would have been included in his  anthology. I highly recommend this book for any one who enjoys fairy tales  and poetry.  It is also interesting for its artistic interpretations of  tales that will not be found in picture books.	2000-04-04

Early variations of well-known  and lesser known tales are included such as Cinderella, Three Little Pigs, Three Bears, and  Tom Tit Tot (similar to Rumpelstiltskin).

This book was originally published in 1981 to answer the  feminist attack against fairy tales that appeared in the 1970s. This  collection pulls stories from several cultures and will be great for  reading at bedtime.  Included in the 21 tales are East of the Sun and West  of the Moon, Duffy and the Devil, and The Old Woman and the Rice Cakes  (from Japan).

The texts have been somewhat reworked and it is great to have them all gathered into one place for reading.  Since this is a smaller volume, it is easier to carry around than his Grimms, Beauty and the Beast, Aesop's Fables, etc. when you just need to read the scholarly works and not the primary texts of the tales.

The collection offers inspiration to poets to explore  the themes in the folklore of our childhoods with grace and charm.  Happily  ever after is not expected by Hay, but she does not express a hopeless  future either.

The book also  contains helpful information about the histories of tales and the breadth  of their coverage across Europe and onto other continents.

Lane offers explanations of themes in folklore and emphasizes what is important in the  performance of a tale, too.  I have dabbled in storytelling and folklore  studies and have found this book to be one of the best for melding the two  together with respect and fairness to both.  The book will be of greater  interest to persons beginning study in either field.  The analysis is  fairly common and doesn't offer much beyond what is available in other  scholarly texts.

The fairy tales  explored are Hansel and Gretel, Snow White, Snow White and Rose Red, Little  Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty (which has the most), The Frog  Prince, Rapunzel, and Rumpelstiltskin.

It can be hard to find  fairy tale collections that contain the work of the women (such as Beaumont  and d'Aulnoy) in the French salons that influenced Charles Perrault.  This  is one of the best collections, and it includes many of the tales that are  mentioned by scholars but hard to locate.  None of the stories are watered  down and they paint a picture of why fairy tales are an important part of  literature.  In the end, they are entertaining stories and can be read just  for fun, too.	2000-03-30
