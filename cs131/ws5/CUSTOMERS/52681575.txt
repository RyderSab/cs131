I was tempted to not give 5 stars due to the poor quality of the included photo's, however, aside from that technical aspect, this book is a testament to the will of an individual to survive against all odds - man made and natural. It is a record of the incredible drama that occurs to someone who is at the mercy of circumstance and the heroic feats he elicits from others. Surely deserving of at least 5 stars.	2005-10-13

An epic accounting of the modern world's worst killer: Influenza. About the disease and the heroic efforts of the scientists who attempted to find a cure but couldn't. A tragedy with perhaps just a little too much information. The author suggests, due to available information, that the pandemic started in America from human to swine and back to human; however, more recently, researchers believe the 1918 strain was probably entirely a bird flu virus that adapted to function in humans. Especially scary as Asia currently is fighting another deadly bird flu which may catch off guard the rest of the world as there is insufficient available vaccine.	2005-10-06

The book has interesting, well developed characters and the story kept my attention. In fact I didn't want to put the book down. It's graphic and disturbing and makes you really want to see the bad one get what he/she deserves. The only drawback, and this is a minor point, were some terms not commonplace in the U.S.	2005-04-27

The Naked Prey is the first book I've read by John Sandford and it won't be the last. There's a good story between the covers with plenty of surprises and a satisfying ending.

Within this book the reader will find a seemingly endless amount of interesting information on an incredible array of topics such as moss, flowers, bird irruptions, where bugs go in winter, plants' healing poisons, canned wildlife and on and on. Of course not an in depth study but enough valid information, gleaned from reliable sources, to inform in a fashion I find exciting as well as educational. Certainly enough to entice further investigation. Frankly, I enjoy subjects presented in this fashion and if it wasn't for the not so great editing this book deserves 5 stars.	2005-02-05

The author apparently decided if he included lots of perversions the reader wouldn't notice the lack of a story. The main character, Frank Clevenger, somehow stumbles through an almost constant drugged blur onto what's going on and takes an absurd course of action that brings a conclusion to a waste of time spent reading this book. I won't dwell on the sex, drugs or gambling which accounts for the bulk of the 358 pages, but instead on the lack of any twisting, turning or surprises, as the ending was predictable and really not much of a mystery at all.	2005-01-25

Unlike many of the genre there is much useful information given regarding being lost in the wilds. Additionally, often there is given more than one way of accomplishing a goal with the author's opinion as to the correct method. The diagrams, mostly, support the text, however, the photo's leave much to be desired. I would buy this book, in fact I did.	2005-01-15

Firemen setting fires because books represent ideas which don't contribute to peace and harmony. Or because they conflict with what the powers that be require you to believe. That was the way Bradbury envisioned the future in Fahrenheit 451. Orwells' 1984 is of the same genre as is Huxley's Brave New World and Leven's This Perfect Day. An excellent read by one of Sci Fi's best and not far from the reality some people have lived and still do today.	2005-01-05

Garfield suggested \\"dream telepathy\\". That is so exciting. The title Mutual Dreaming entices and I hoped it might open a door but alas Ms. Magallon's book is but a compilation of dreams or stories that may or may not suggest mutuality and offers nothing that doesn't smack of fiction.

This is the best book, on the subject, ever....if you've got or are part of an army. Oh, and you've got to be at war too. Of course, I suspect this book might be useful, perhaps even very useful, for those involved (I mean really involved) in paintball competitions or even for those on the fringe who practice this stuff out in the sticks preparing for \\"the rev\\" . However, for practical purposes I'd suggest looking elsewhere. It is compact (small w/small print too)to the point of impracticality and for most it doesn't address true to life survival practices.	2004-09-17

First published in '96 but I'd have thought earlier, perhaps in the 70's. Some useful information regarding evasion but really very little else of interest, just rehashed stuff from another era.

Not so with &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot;.

It isn't just a book about rabbits, it's a book about life, danger, tragedy, humor, adventure, overcoming adversity , death and legacy. The gamut of one's emotions are touched and it's difficult not to want to finish the book at one sitting. Through Mr. Adams's narrative you can almost experience the warmth of a burrow, the kinship of comrades and the incredible thrill of overcoming obstacles on your path of survival.

I'm not a race fan and had almost no prior knowledge of the horse. In fact had the book not been loaned to me, to read, by a friend who loves horses and has her own named Charley I would not have read the book. Sometimes wonders explode from within the pages of books. This was one of those times. I sat entranced, enthralled with Laura Hillenbrand's narrative. I could hardly bear to put it down.

The title of this review is meant to applaud the story which is, in my opinion, first rate and it is nicely written. It shouldn't be necessary to explain this novel is of a genre which not all will find to their liking though. For Stephen King fans Hearts in Atlantis is an idea somewhat like Firestarter or The Stand, both of which are also favorites of mine. And the movie, of the same name, which starred Anthony Hopkins is true to the book. I was dissapointed somewhat because I wanted more to read than there was and also the additional chapters were a little long, however, it was interesting in how they all tied into the main story.	2003-07-04

It was right up my alley and in my opinion worthy of five stars.	2002-09-13

This book is so interesting and informative I had difficulty putting it down. E.C. Pielou has enlightened and entertained me all at once and has succeeded in writing one of the most fascinating books I've read.	2002-06-19

I was engrossed with the facts and thrilled by the many directions of the witty style of Anne Matthews and found \\"Wild Nights\\" thoroughly entertaining and very informative. And, having lived in \\"Gotham\\", I can attest to the accuracy of much of the content. It's thought provoking how much is missed when we don't remember to reflect on the sequence of events. Anne Matthews has captured a linear progression of history, natural and other, and displayed it interestingly. One star omitted due to the last chapter's jaunt to Armageddon.	2002-06-19

I'm facinated by the person she emotes through her writing. This is not just a book of bees. It is instead a narrative of life in tune with the natural world. Sue Hubble is accurate in her observations and true in her depictions. And, I am a beekeeper.	2002-06-01

Like a fine craftsman he was one with the subject and as an artist he has accurately recorded what he observed and has presented the information coherently. I'm left with an indelible, poignant legacy.	2002-03-07

Extremely pleased with the American Horticultural Society &quot;Plant Propagation&quot;<br />No need to search further, the authors explain everything, when to and how to, and many, many plants are covered with excellent information on grafting and budding as well. I rate it among the best books in my library.	2002-03-07
US	52681575	R3EP5LPVLA04RD	1585003557	477838585	How to Hypnotize Yourself...Without Losing Your Mind: A Self-Hypnosis Training Program for Students and Educators	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Not the best choice.	Compares unfavorably to other books in this genre. There is the inevitable commercial, in every chapter, to visit the author's web site. There is considerable repetition. Almost leads the reader to believe there was a maximum amount of difficulty finding text to fill the (required?) pages. I don't believe the book was proof read, there are so many errors in spelling, sentence structure etc. I purchased the book relying on past reviews and, frankly, I will not make that mistake again.  Review of paperback.	2000-09-12

Author gets right to the point and  makes the point understandable. There is absolutely nothing missed in this  volume. Plenty of technique, lots of routines, nothing left to the  imagination.	2000-09-12
