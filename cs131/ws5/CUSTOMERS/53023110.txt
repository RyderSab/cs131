He says that there is no reason to avoid excess exposure to sunlight, for example, because, he says, sunlight does not cause melanoma, since melanoma is more common, he says, in areas where people get less sunlight - completely ignoring all that has been learned about the disease, or even the obvious facts that melanoma rates are extremely high among white people in Australia, and rates in the US have increased significantly in recent years.  Apparently he is unaware of all of the experience that real physicians have with this disease. The book is filled with similar nonsense.  Please do not damage your health by taking advice from someone who does not know what he is talking about!	2004-05-22

The plot has great gaping holes, and the writing in general makes it much harder to believe in the events of the story than is typical for Anne McCaffrey. Definitely not worth the cover price, no matter what the discount! Now I am wary of anything Todd McCaffrey collaborates with his mother on, if this is what he brings to a book.	2004-04-22

He enjoyed designing potholders with nice color progressions and patterns, and made potholder after potholder until we ran out of loops. (The kit had enough loops for about seven or eight potholders, I think, though the last one had badly clashing colors. We need more loops now.)<br />As a parent, I appreciated the clear instructions in how to finish the edges, and, since my children are so enthusiastic, I am grateful for all the things the book describes making with the finished products, so I'm not obligated to give all of those potholders a home in my kitchen. :-) There are several clever little projects.<br />The included loom is made of sturdy plastic which does not hurt your fingers, and they also enclose a crochet hook and a large plastic needle for finishing. No other materials are needed, which made this a great find for kid entertainment on our vacation.	2003-07-21

I read Forging the Darksword, Doom of the Darksword, and finally Triumph of the Darksword, wanting to know how it would come out, and hoping, expecting, that it would get better. It did not. The pace drags, the plot fails to hang together, and the characters fail to become real.

This book has no discussion of money, but it teaches that 100 equals 2 times 50, 4 times 25, 5 times 20, and 10 times 10, just the right lesson for him at that time. The rhythm of the rhyming works pretty well, and the pictures are very clever, adding a lot of enjoyment to the story. This one is worth reading again and again, if that's the kind of child you have.	2003-04-17

This approach may be necessary for some families, but I personally couldn't do it. I can handle only a few minutes of crying, and only after the baby reaches the age of six months or so, myself. I found Richard Ferber's book, Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems, to be vastly kinder and more humane, besides explaining things much more clearly and providing many more alternatives. If you have a problem with the idea of leaving a child to cry for more than a few minutes, I would strongly advise that you try Ferber's book first, and progress to Weissbluth's only if Ferber's methods do not work for your family.	2003-03-05

I would recommend it for a child who is advanced enough in language to have no problems with the meanings of words such as \\"former\\", and \\"infantry\\", and yet slow enough in math to need the lesson that 25 leaves a remainder of one when divided by 2, 3, or 4, but not 5. I spent more time explaining to my six-year-old child that the sergeant is Joe's boss, and that \\"former\\" means what he used to be but no longer is, than I spent on reading the book! The attractive block-print illustrations lack the clever jokes of those found in \\"One Hundred Hungry Ants\\", as well.	2003-02-22

I've been reading this aloud to my ten-year-old, with only occasional asides explaining an unfamiliar word or pointing out an anachronism, and he now knows more about relativity than most adults. The explanation of how an atomic bomb works is wonderfully clear. The plots and characters retain my son's interest, keeping this firmly among the ranks of \\"fun\\" rather than \\"improving\\" books, while explaining important material in an easily understood way.	2003-01-29

This much more ambitious work, however, works on so many more levels that even my much less fantasy-oriented husband couldn't put it down, while I relished the depth and multiple layers of meaning. Yes, you have to work a little bit harder than with Lackey's less challenging works, but the payoff is enormous! The individual characters are *so* individual, so non-formula, so interesting. The book's whole world, with its alternate history from ours, is fascinating. This is a book to be savored, rather than gobbled mindlessly (though I very much enjoy doing the latter, too, on occasion).	2003-01-10

Are you one of those people who requires paint-by-number picture kits, and dotes on full step-by-step Martha-style craft instructions? If so, don't bother with this book.

I would never have thought to tie-BLEACH a garment before dyeing it, for wonderful lightening-bolt effects, for example. All I need is good pictures of good project ideas, with a little info on what types of techniques and materials to use; I don't need someone to hold my hand and murmur reassurances as I go along.

I enjoyed it, definitely, and would recommend it to Willis fans, but it should certainly not be the first Connie Willis book you read. She has written such wonderful books! This one contained a lot of good stuff, but it did go on and on, and, unlike those of her other books, many of this one's apparently extraneous details turned out to indeed be extraneous, unless I was missing something. I love the way Connie Willis can bombard you with details that seem like fluff at the time and then turn out to be extremely important and vital to the plot, so it was disappointing to find this book to be far less tightly constucted.	2002-06-24

Most hypothyroid patients are not truly healthy without T3 (liothyronine), however, and continue to suffer with brain fog, cold sensitivity, fatigue, etc. unless they are treated with both T3 and T4. (See, for example, the New England Journal of Medicine, 1999, volume 340, pp 424-429.) Furthermore, Dr. Rubenfeld provides no information for those who have &quot;normal&quot; TSH test results but are still hypothyroid, as evidenced by the results of rarer tests such as the TRH Stimulation test.
