I concur with the reviewer who suggested that the newbie proceed as follows: <br /> <br />1) Read Edmund White's little Penguin biography so as to orient yourself. This will lessen the culture shock when you are first confronted with Swann's Way (or The Way by Swann's, as the English prefer). <br /> <br />2) Read Proust. This is actually my third perambulation, so I'm a bit unsure how much of the novel to recommend. Whatever you do, get a good start on it, sufficient that you know you will persevere. <br /> <br />3) Read Tadie. Much of what has mystified you in In Search of Lost Time (Remembrance of Things Past, whatever) will suddenly become clear. For example, how is it that young Marcel (most writers call him the Narrator) with his wheezing and his mother complex and his odd ideas about sexuality is welcomed in the highest reaches of Paris society? Well, why not, since Proust was! People loved him, men and women, rich and poor, nobility and servants. Knowing about Proust's life makes Marcel/Narrator a lot more credible. The same is true of other characters, such as Charles Swann. (Some of Proust's characters, including the Baron Charlus and the awful Madame Verdurin, are so good that their real-life equivalents are but pale imitations. They need no biography to limn them.) <br /> <br />Tadie is a vast undertaking--as of course is In Search of Lost Time. I became so interested in the biography that I have put aside the final volume, Finding Time Again, so as to concentrate on the biography.  <br /> <br />A suggestion: skip the footnotes. I began doing so at about the halfway point of the biography, and I'm enjoying it more and following it better. Those constant interruptions (it's not unusual for the footnotes to occupy a quarter or a third of the page) made it difficult for me to follow the text. Maybe Tadie has to be read three times, like the novel itself! <br /> <br />It's a splendid work. I've read three Proust biographies, the third one (apart from Tadie'sand White's) being Marcel Proust: A Biography, by Roger Hayman (out of print). It's a better read, but it pales as a biography and as an introduction to the novel.  <br /> <br />-- Dan Ford at readingproust dot com	2005-10-07

It's as if Proust divided his experience into two parts, giving the romantic elements to Marcel and the comic part to Charlus. <br /> <br />The two romances come together at the seaside salon of the awful Madame Verdurin, who is inexorably rising in the world.

He learned to play the piano from the composer Paul Hindemith, and he assembled a jet-powered vehicle (six skyrockets lashed to a coaster wagon) at the age of 12. As the youthful chief of Germany's rocket program, he got into trouble with his Nazi overlords because he talked of space travel when all they wanted from him was to drop explosives on the heads of their enemies. <br /> <br />Von Braun not only led Germany into space--by way of the V-2 ballistic missile that hammered London in the last year of World War II--but the United States as well. His portable allegiances caused the comedian Mort Sahl to quip, after seeing a von Braun biopic called I Aim at the Stars: \\"But sometimes I miss and hit London!\\"  <br /> <br />Bob Ward is most interesting when he deals with the question of von Braun's war guilt-not only a Nazi, but an SS officer and head of a factory that employed slave labor. The story flags a bit (and so, in the end, did the seemingly indefatigable von Braun) amid the politics and bureaucracy of Fort Bliss, Redstone Arsenal, and NASA's Washington headquarters. Still, a worthwhile biography of a fascinating man. - Dan Ford <br />	2005-05-22

A Boeing aerodynamicist, George Schairer, happened to be in Europe that month, helping the U.S. military understand German technology before the Japanese could deploy it in the Pacific. Germany had not yet surrendered, and everyone expected the Japanese to fight on for years. <br /> <br /> <br />When the Hermann Gring institute in Vlkenrode was captured by U.S. troops, Schairer was able to quiz the staff about an unusual aspect of their latest aircraft: the wings were angled to the rear. Why was that? The Germans explained that sweep-back slowed the apparent airflow, enabling an airplane to gain an extra 50 or 75 mph before it ran into transonic turbulence. Schairer wrote home: hold everything! <br /> <br /> <br />Boeing redrew its B-47, not only creating the quintessential jet bomber of the 1950s, but also the basic design of its 707 transport and all the heavy metal that followed. Even the newest Boeing airliner--and the super-jumbo from Airbus too--owes a little something to that impromptu seminar at Vlkenrode.  <br /> <br /> <br />Wolfgang Samuel is uniquely qualified to write the story of how German technology came to the New World. The son of a Luftwaffe pilot, he immigrated in 1951 and became a colonel in the U.S. Air Force. Like many American and British writers, he has a tendency to glorify imports like the Messerschmitt 262 jet fighter. To be sure, Nazi Germany had the better engineers--fat lot of good they did it! A bludgeon, not a scalpel, was the war-winning technology in 1945. Indeed, it can be argued that Germany's fascination with far-out designs contributed to its defeat, frittering away resources that should have been devoted to more mundane weapons. <br /> <br /> <br />In any event, the war in the Pacific ended before either side could exploit the German technology. Far more important was the brains behind that technology:the U.S. imported hundreds of scientists, too. They became founding members of the American aerospace industry: Wernher von Braun, father of the ballistic missile; Hans von Ohain, builder of the world's first operational turbojet; and Alexander Lippisch, designer of tailless, swept-wing aircraft.  <br /> <br /> <br />In 1945, as Mr. Samuel explains, Russia too was scouring Germany for knowledge to exploit. If those men had gone east instead of west, the Cold War would have been waged on terms much less favorable to the United States. -- Dan Ford	2005-04-17

This particular book would be the British paperback edition, for the American press run has so far only given us four volumes, all of which are for sale on Amazon in a uniform style. <br /> <br />There are small but real differences between the British and American editions. With their greater tolerance for continental foibles, the Brits retained French punctuation, using dashes instead of quotation marks for conversation. They also retained the French wherever Proust makes a literary reference, providing a translation in the notes; in the American edition, this policy is reversed. <br /> <br />In reading the first two volumes (\\"Swanns' Way\\" and \\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower\\") I noticed typographical errors that might well have resulted in converting the British to the American languages, rather than from French to English. For example, on page 95 of \\"In the Shadow\\" there is the phrase \\"Professor Cottard and his wife were not to partake of the pleasure\\" when the sentence should actually read \\"NOW to partake,\\" since Swann has decided to introduce the Cottards to the Duchesse! Not earthshaking, but it does rather spoil Proust's little joke. <br /> <br />In short, these British paperbacks will serve very nicely if the American reader is in a hurry to complete the novel, and they may also be more free of errors. But I will probably wait for the uniform hardcover Viking volumes. <br /> <br />I haven't read Mr. Patterson's translation of volume seven, but I give it five stars based on the company it keeps.	2005-03-12

We probably know too much about LBJ for wild satirical riffs: For all his faults, he didn't launch the Vietnam War at a pizza party. Still, the novel's early scenes set the tone. \\"Nam-a-Rama\\" soon takes flight, its plot veering wildly, darkly and amusingly as we follow the exploits of the narrator, Almost Capt. Jack Armstrong, and his mad buddy, Almost Capt. Gearheardt. <br /> <br />At one point, Armstrong is assigned as air officer to a Marine infantry company in Vietnam, calling in bombs and shells to keep the grunts from being overrun. For a chapter or two, we're persuaded that ground combat -- with its death, fear, heroism, profanity and stink -- is a weird joke played upon humans by the immortals. God, in Mr. Jennings's telling, wears a cashmere sweater and loud pants and is in a hurry to get on with his golf game. <br /> <br />Portraying the absurdity and grotesque oddity of war, Mr. Jennings rivals his hero, Joseph Heller, to whose World War II novel \\"Nam-a-Rama\\" clearly pays tribute. (Like Heller, Mr. Jennings mines his personal experience -- he was a U.S. Marine and Air America helicopter pilot in Southeast Asia.) The story eventually moves from battle to back channels: At the behest of President Larry Bob, the two almost-captains go to Hanoi to strike a deal with Ho Chi Minh, or perhaps to kill him. They might even accomplish their mission -- whatever it is -- were it not for Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, who has been studying \\"Catch-22\\" in the belief that it represents America's strategic guide for the Vietnam War. <br /> <br />\\"Nam-a-Rama\\" culminates -- as real life often does -- in a confusion of motives, misdeeds and unintended consequences. But all to wonderful comedic effect. Then, at the last, Mr. Jennings limns his japes with a tribute to the men who fought in Vietnam, especially to the Marines, in words so beautiful that they brought tears to my eyes. Rarely does a novelist storm the emotional ramparts so decisively. <br /> <br />Buy it. Read it. Keep it in your library. It's the Great Vietnam War Novel. <br /> <br />-- Dan Ford	2005-03-11

I started \\"Swann's Way\\" a few times before a friend suggested that we read the whole of \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\" together. Every Wednesday on his way to the office, he'd stop by my room (it wasn't really an apartment) and we'd drink coffee, smoke(!), and talk about the book. Encouraged in this way, we both finished the novel. I read it again, and aloud, to my wife over the course of two winters. When Kilmartin's reworking came out, I acquired that but only read the final part (\\"The Past Recaptured\\"), which Scott-Montcrief died before translating, and which in my 1950s edition was the subject of a pedestrian translation by Frederick Blossom.<br /><br />After reading a rave review of vol. 2 (\\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower\\") in this new translation, I decided to acquire it, and then I thought better of the decision and got \\"Swann's Way\\" as well. It was the right move. Lydia Davis does a wonderful job with this first volume. (It also helps that I am familiar with the text: I know what comes next and sometimes can quote from memory.) It's been criticized here as too literal, but my own impression is rather different. Finding a typo in the Davis translation, I compared the sentence with the Montcrief/Kilmartin version, and I thought Davis's was better. They were actually almost the same, word for word, except that Davis uses \\"said\\" where the previous translation has \\"exclaimed.\\" I will always go with the writer who uses the simpler verb!<br /><br />Just as each generation of readers gets its new translation of Homer, so Viking/Penguin has given us a Proust for the 21st century. It is technically more accurate than the earlier versions, because it incorporates the latest French scholarship on Proust. More to the point, for the American reader, Davis and her colleagues have freshened up Scott Montcrief's rather dusty prose. And by employing seven translators instead of just one, they avoid the tragedy of having the translator die before the job is done, as Scott Montcrief did.<br /><br />As noted, there are a few typographical errors in the American edition of the new \\"Swann's Way.\\" Except for the one cited above (\\"O\\" for \\"An\\"), they won't cause any confusion.As noted, there are a few typographical errors in the American edition of the new \\"Swann's Way.\\" Except for the one cited above (\\"O\\" for \\"An\\"), they won't cause any confusion.	2005-03-09

What Lydia Davis has accomplished in the 2004 Swann's way, and James Grieve in Young Girls in Flower, suggests that \\"our\\" Proust is at hand. -- Dan Ford	2005-02-27

Take it with you when you go to see Leonardo playing Howard on the big screen, so you can keep the airplanes straight and also remind yourself that, for all his genius, Howard Hughes was a rather shabby pilot. (A ***** stick, as they say in the Air Force.) <br /> <br />     To save money on aeronautical charts, he flew with the road maps handed out free by oil companies. He ignored air-traffic controllers, filed misleading flight plans, identified himself with the name of his co-pilot, flew under visual rules in bad weather, and cut off the pilot ahead of him in the pattern. Even as a passenger, George Marrett writes, Hughes could turn a routine flight into a debacle. His big ambition was to outshine Lindberg. <br /> <br />     Of course Howard Hughes was more than an aviator: he made movies, ran an airline, designed the half-cup bra, founded aerospace companies, made billions, and was the country's most famous hypochondriac. But those are incidentals as for a fellow pilot like George Marrett, who flew a rescue Skyraider in Vietnam and wrote about it in Cheating Death, and who afterward became a test pilot for Hughes Aircraft. By concentrating on the aviation side of his former boss, Marrett has written a short, readable, and fascinating biography. In his hands, Howard Hughes turns out to have been a lot more interesting than Charles Lindbergh, though he never came close to him as an aviator. <br /> <br />-- Dan Ford	2004-12-31

One of the reader reviews tries to discredit &quot;Stolen Valor&quot; by declaring that it is wrong in saying that Colin Powell served in combat in South Vietnam. But the reviewer is wrong! As a 25-year-old captain, Powell served a six-month tour as advisor to an ARVN battalion, starting in January 1963. The tour ended when he was med-evacked for a foot wound from a punji stick. It was only on his *second* Vietnam tour, in 1968, that 30-year-old Major Powell filled headquarters roles, having been identified as a &quot;water-walker&quot; and put on the fast track for advancement.	2004-04-03

Where to begin? Well, for openers, Burkett filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the military records of the famously liberal Dan Rather, anchor of the CBS Evening News. Recalling how Rather spent much of the 1990 campaign beating up on Dan Quayle for avoiding the Vietnam draft as a member of the National Guard, Burkett gleefully discovered that Rather himself hid out from the Korean War as a member of the Reserves. When he graduated from college in 1954, after the war was safely over, Rather joined the Marines and was discharged as medically unfit after four months. Of course, this doesn't stop Rather from proudly identifying himself as an ex-Marine! <br />This by way of preface to a CBS documentary called &quot;The Wall Within,&quot; in which Rather and his camera team prowled the Washington woods in search of &quot;trip-wire vets&quot; who were so crazed by their Vietnam experience that they could not safely live in society. Guess what? They were bogus. Of the CBS poster boys for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PSTD), most never served in Vietnam, and those who did were in non-combat roles. Some of them didn't even live in the woods. (It's not just CBS, of course. David Brinkley, Linda Ellerbee, and other television notables also take their lumps.) <br /> And so it goes! After a few chapters, what surprises the reader is the chance occasion when a story turns out to be true. Are there any genuine Viet-vet horror stories out there? Take the gent whose photograh appeared in hundreds of newspapers across the country, sobbing manfully at the Traveling Wall on Memorial Day 1996, while outfitted in the standard-issue wannabe uniform of boonie hat, fatigues, and mismatched pins and patches. He was Roni DeJoseph of Brooklyn, who evidently never served in the U.S. military, never mind the Marine division in Vietnam that he claimed as his own. <br />This is a fascinating book that may come into its own, now that service in and around that war (Bush's stint in theTexas Air Guard, Kerry's in the Vietnam Veterans Against the War) has become a political hot-button. It took me a long time to buy it, largely because it was self-published. My loss! If you're interested in the Vietnam War, PSTD, and the perennial but mysterious phenomenon of the fake war hero (or the even more amazing phenomenon of the fake anti-war hero), get a copy for yourself. By the time you've read a couple hundred pages--it's a long book--you'll find yourself wondering if anybody is what he says he is. -- Dan Ford	2004-04-03

(On the cover: Gene Swanson, U.S. Marine at Iwo Jima; and Gary Swanson, army infantryman in Vietnam.) It works best when there are recognizable pairs, which is not always the case. Then it reverts to a run-of-the-mill oral history. <br />The most stunning chapters are the first two, relating the stories of Mike Novosel senior and junior. Mike Sr. was a career officer: he flew B-29s against Japan and a &quot;dust-off&quot; helicopter in Vietnam. In the latter work, he was joined in 1970 by Mike Jr. So here they were, 47-year-old father and 20-year-old son, pulling wounded men out of the rain forest and giving them another chance at life. Today the two men live side by side in houses that are mirror images of one another. &quot;Dad is both my father and an Army buddy,&quot; Mike Jr. says. What a fortunate pair of men! <br />What's most striking about these pairs of stories is how different the two wars played out. World War II was a narrative with a beginning, a middle, and an end: the soldiers started green, learned to fight, and returned as heroes. Vietnam was a surreal painting, a black novel, an existential mess where men counted bodies in lieu of winning battles; when they came home, they took off their uniforms for fear that they would literally be stoned in the street. <br />Eminently worth reading -- Dan Ford	2004-01-31

Engines stall in mid-air. Singapore falls before China gets raped. B-25 bombers are called Billys. Roosevelt is called the Dutchman; Hirohito, the Boy Soldier; and American flyers of course are Flyboys, on almost every page. Casualties are confused with fatalities. Aerial warfare takes place in the third dimension, land warfare in the first, and naval warfare in the second. On page 141, 800 Japanese on Attu Island made a suicide charge upon American troops; on page 143, the number is 2,350. Japanese pilots become \\"another notch in a Flyboy's belt.\\" <br />Bradley's technique seems to have been to find the most startling book--in English--on a subject, then to borrow heavily from it. Often enough he doesn't bother to rewrite the excerpts; he throws quotation marks around them and inserts them into his text without saying where they're from. I generally read a book like this with my right index finger in the citations page; in this case, it's the only way to know whom he's quoting. <br />He abuses statistics in a remarkable way: he says that American soldiers during the pacificiation of the Philippines earlier in the century killed 7,000 locals a month, then declares that \\"Hitler and Tojo combined, with all their mechanized weaponry, killed the same per month.\\" Huh? Hitler and Tojo killed a *million* people a month, of whom 7,000 happened to be American.<br />It's the same with his analogies: sure, the Japanese murdered a few prisoners, but what about Americans who sank Japanese transports, then machine-gunned the survivors in the water? To Bradley, these are similar atrocities, rather overlooking the fact that soldiers in the water become combatants if they got ashore. Killing them wasn't pretty, but it wasn't a war crime.<br />Even the cannibalism on Chichi Jima isn't as unknown as he makes out. I read about it long ago in Lord Russell's *Knights of Bushido*. Indeed, the most eye-popping bit of evidence in *Flyboys* (a formal order to produce the flesh of an American pilot for a battalion feast) is lifted from Russell's book. <br />Bradley did do some original research. He walked the ground on Chichi Jima--always a good idea, but one seldom pursued by historians--and best of all he interviewed some of the Japanese survivors, including one of the cannibals. Surely he could have made a book out of this material without the foolish Flyboys, Billys, and Dutchmen, and without the strained efforts to show that the Japanese, if no better than the Americans, were at least no worse. It might have been a shorter book, but it would have been a better one. -- Dan Ford	2003-12-20

What about Nagasaki? Would the invasion of Japan really have cost the lives of a million American soldiers, or were the Japanese eager to give up? And hey, what about those Russians?<br />People know amazingly little about the Pacific War, compared to the epic conflict between the white nations in Europe. Indeed, the first two weeks of August 1945 loom larger for the chattering classes than do the four years that preceded them--eight years if you date the war from the invasion of China proper--fourteen years if you consider that it started with Japan's annexation of Manchuria. I've been reading about the events of August 1945 for a decade, and I have to say that the analysis gets better as the years go by. Richard Frank's book is the best yet.<br />Olympic: First off, Frank gives a good capsule description of Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu planned for November 1, and Ketsu-go, the preparations being made to destroy the American invasion force at the beaches. Frank then brings up evidence that during the summer of 1945, the Japanese reinforcement of Kyushu was so fearsome that American planners were beginning to turn against the invasion. By October 15, they now believed, 625,000 troops would be defending Kyushu. On Luzon, Okinawa, and Iwo Jima, the Japanese had shown their willingness to fight almost to the last man, with death tolls running as high as 97 or 98 percent. Meanwhile, they inflicted casualties at the rate of one American for every one or two defenders. To me, that suggests 600,000 Japanese soldiers dead on Kyushu, and upwards of 300,000 Americans killed, wounded, or missing. No wonder Truman wanted the Russians in the war, and no wonder he dropped the atomic bombs.<br />The Russians are coming! After stringing Japan along for several weeks--the Japanese foolishly hoped that the Soviet Union would broker a negotiated peace with the Allies--the Russians attacked on August 9. So poor were the communications that neitherTokyo nor the Japanese armies on the mainland were aware of how massive the onslaught would be. The battles continued to August 22 in Manchuria--a week after the Japanese surrender--and in Korea the Russians continued to advance until they reached the 38th parallel at the end of the month.<br />The third object of the Russian attack was Japanese-occupied Sakhalin, and from there an amphibious landing on the northernmost island of Hokkaido. As might be expected, the Japanese fought more ferociously in defense of the homeland than they did for their mainland possessions, and the Russian advance was slow. That resistance, plus an equally stubborn reaction by President Truman, prevented the Soviet Union from gaining a foothold on Hokkaido and thus a voice in the occupation of Japan. On August 22, Stalin halted operations in this area.<br />Frank estimates that 2.6 million overseas Japanese were captured by the Russians and sent into slave labor. Of this number, about 350,000 died or disappeared into the Gulag--a loss that probably exceeded all of Japan's losses to American air raids in the last year of the war, including the great Tokyo fire-bombing raid and the two atomic attacks.<br />National suicide: &quot;Even though we may have to eat grass, swallow dirt, and lie in the fields, we shall fight on to the bitter end, ever firm in our faith that we shall find life in death&quot;--so said General Anami, the army minster and one of three (possibly four) hard-liners in the Big Six war cabinet. Given the Japanese requirement for consensus, the military men held veto power over cabinet deliberations. They were backed by officers at all levels of the army and navy: on August 13, Admiral Onishi broke into a government conference to urge: &quot;Let us formulate a plan for certain victory, obtain the Emperor's sanction, and throw ourselves into bringing the plans to realization. If we are prepared to sacrifice 20,000,000 Japanese lives in a special [suicide] effort, victory will be ours!&quot;<br />Prime Minister Suzuki: &quot;[T]he atomic bombs and the Soviet entry into the war are, in a sense, gifts from the gods.&quot; Lacking these new incentives, he feared a revolution that would topple the throne.<br />General Anami, by the way, wasn't just talking the talk. He walked the walk, committing suicide when the government finally agreed to surrender.<br />The atomic arsenal: Frank believes that &quot;another bomb was not ready anyway&quot; at the end of the war, because George Marshall and Leslie Groves had delayed transport of the core to Tinian, &quot;making it impossible to ready a third bomb until about August 21.&quot; (See the third bomb on this site.) &quot;Groves and Marshall took this action because they believed two bombs would move the Japanese to capitulation, concurring with [SecWar] Stimson's policy that [atomic] bombs should be used only to end the war.&quot; Elsewhere, Frank says that on August 13, Maj Gen John Hull telephoned an officer at the Manhattan Project on behalf of General Marshall, saying that the chief of staff wanted all future bombs reserved for tactical use in Operation Olympic.<br />The Manhattan Project officer estimated that seven bombs would be ready by October 31--the day before the projected invasion. Displaying the then-universal ignorance of long-term radioactivity, he advised a 48-hour &quot;safety factor&quot; before American soldiers advanced into areas hit by atomic weapons. (In an earlier report, the same officer had guessed that radioactivity could be lethal out to 3,500 feet from an explosion, but that the ground would be safe just one hour later.)<br />At noon on August 14 in Washington, President Truman met with the Duke of Windsor and British ambassador John Balfour. He told them that the latest Japanese message indicated no acceptance of the surrender terms, and that (in Balfour's words) &quot;he had no alternative but to order an atomic bomb dropped on Tokyo.&quot; It was at 4:05 p.m. local time that he learned that the Japanese had indeed surrendered.<br />This is an extraordinary book that belongs on the shelf of anyone with an interest in how the Pacific War was concluded, and why it ended that way -- Dan Ford	2003-12-15

More than a survey of militarism in a unique culture, Mr. High uses the movie business as a way to explore Japanese life and behavior during the awfulness, for example by explaining the American bombing raids in terms of the number of movie houses destroyed each month. I've seen but not been able to understand the dialogue in several of the films he discusses, and I was delighted to have some of the gaps filled for me.

Over the course of six years, Qaddafi sponsored terrorist strikes at American and other interests, and the U.S. responded with naval maneuvers in the Gulf of Sidra and proxy wars in Africa. (France was involved with the U.S., Egypt, and others.) The cover shows one of these minor but bloody skirmishes, in which a Libyan gunboat was blown out of the water. They did nothing to slow Qaddafi, who in 1986 masterminded an explosion in a Berlin disco frequented by American soldiers. Within hours, the U.S. was planning a military strike. True to form, France refused overflight rights, so the Britain-based bombers had to fly a 3,000-mile route out over the Atlantic and back into the Mediterranean. Did it work? Not entirely.

The students (who appear to have been company- and field-grade officers) had a remarkable grasp of how World War II would work out, foreseeing for example a sneak attack by the Japanese, the early loss of the Philippines, a &quot;Germany first&quot; strategy on the part of the western allies, and a cautious island-hopping retaking of the Pacific by the U.S. Understandably, they did not take such leaps as the possibility that Germany might over-run France in a few weeks, or that the development of carrier warfare might make the climatic naval battle (expected by both the U.S. and Japanese navies) an impossibility. Gole's point, as I understand it, is that by playing these annual games, a third-rate army (the U.S. Army had fewer than 200,000 men in the late 1930s) was able to leverage its officer corps into a cadre that could command an army ten times as large, and that was therefore ready to wage and win a global war. The book will repay a second reading. - Dan Ford	2003-01-25

In this particular case, he is one of the few who have accessed Japanese records, and he compares them with Allied accounts on a day-by-day basis. This is great stuff, especially for those of us who already know something about the campaigns. My particular interest is the Flying Tigers of Burma, and I was delighted to have Shores's version, especially since he gives equal time to the RAF squadrons that fought alongside the AVG. But I confess that it took a great deal of concentration for me to slog through the Philippines campaign, about which I knew very little. So my conclusion is this: the more you know already, the more you will learn from this account. -- Dan Ford	2002-12-28

This handsome, detailed book lifts the curtain on the Japanese army units that fought in China, Southeast Asia, and the home islands during World War II. It's based on a Japanese-language text by a noted historian and an aviation buff, and rendered into workable English by the British historian Christopher Shores. The result is a much more accessible book than the earlier one by the same Japanese authors about the larger Japanese navy air force. There are many photos, side-views of JAAF fighters, accounts of the major campaigns, biographies of the aces (happily arranged in alphabetical order so you can quickly look them up), and an appendix listing every major air combat and every JAAF pilot lost in 15 years of war. A solid book that belongs in the library of every serious student of the Pacific War. -- Dan Ford	2002-12-23

Kershaw's first volume (\\"Hubris\\") was an outright biography, with the beginnings of the Nazi era in Germany, and that was interesting enough.<br />\\"Nemesis\\" is on another level altogether. (You can tell that the author is British. No American historian or biographer would dare to put such titles on his books: Hubris is the pride that destroys, and Nemesis is the fate that destroys the proud.) It is at once the story of a man and the nation he led to ruin, a short history of the war and especially the calamitous Eastern Front, and a study of how the Houlocaust came to be.<br />I can't recommend this book too highly. Buy it and read it, if you have any hope of understanding the most monstrous regime of the 20th century, if not the entire history of mankind. Then, when you're done, go back and read the first volume.<br />-- Dan Ford	2002-09-21

With his Japanese co-author, Mr. Axell (who taught for a time in Japan) is able to get at Japanese-language sources and oral histories that have mostly been ignored by western scholars. This can be spellbinding stuff.<br />Unfortunately, the Japanese orientation leads them into many niggling errors that leap off the page to a western reader versed in military aviation. There's also a pro-Japanese bias in their presentation of material, especially when they strain to find parallels to the kamikaze in western air forces. <br />Excerpts from a kamikaze how-to manual are a chilling reminder to anyone who remembers the similar document carried by the al Qaeda suicide pilots of September 11, 2001.<br />Very much worth the reading, but take it with a grain of salt.	2002-09-09

He was a compact man, straight as a ramrod, with a small smile and bushy eyebrows. He loved to talk, especially on technical matters, but he seldom spoke about what it was like to be a submariner in the Pacific, in a war that claimed the lives of 22% of the Americans who went to sea in the pig boats, as submarines were called. It was a pleasure to meet him again in \\"The Bravest Man\\" and to learn more about his remarkable accomplishments in World War II.<br />That a submariner need not find the enemy was brought home to O'Kane in 1942 on his first patrol in Wahoo, under an older captain who had learned caution in the peacetime Navy. The cautious skipper was replaced by Dudley \\"Mush\\" Morton, who with O'Kane's support made Wahoo the deadliest American boat in the Pacific, sinking nine ships on one ferocious patrol through the Yellow Sea, between China and Korea. \\"You can't afford to flinch,\\" Morton said; \\"you can't afford to give up. You must constantly keep 'rassling, and keep shooting till you destroy him.\\"<br />Wahoo was later lost with all hands, not including O'Kane, who by then -- the fall of 1943 -- had command of Tang. He soon proved that he too had a great desire to keep 'rassling and to sink Japanese ships, despite the second-rate torpedoes supplied to American submarines. On its first patrol, Tang sank five ships; on its second, it rescued 22 American airmen, shot down in the battle for Truk at the center of the Pacific's Caroline Islands. On its fourth patrol, it set a U.S. record by sending 10 enemy ships to the bottom, despite new torpedoes that were sometimes as balky as the old.<br />As a skipper, Richard O'Kane was audacious, persistent and inventive. He was willing to go up against the shore, if that's where the enemy was to be found. Yet he always had an escape route in mind -- and he took care of his people. Sailorsclamored to join Tang, despite its record of going in harm's way.<br />Alas, having a good captain is never enough. On Tang's fifth patrol, the odds caught up with O'Kane, and he had the unhappy experience of watching his 24th and last torpedo circle back to explode on the boat's stern. The men on the bridge were thrown into the water, but their troubles were scarcely over. It was the middle of the night, and they had no flotation gear. <br />When morning came, 9 of the 87 crewmen were still alive, including some who had made the first-ever escape from a submarine sunk in combat. They were picked up by a Japanese destroyer, whose captain treated them decently but delivered them to starvation, torture and slave labor at Yokohama. Like aviators, submariners were classified as \\"special prisoners of Japan,\\" imprisoned in the foulest camps with their existence unreported to the International Red Cross. Again O'Kane survived the impossible, to be reunited with his family and to receive the Medal of Honor from the hand of President Harry Truman.<br />The author of \\"The Bravest Man\\" is himself a U.S. Navy veteran, who in 1968 won the Pulitzer as a reporter in Vietnam. Mr. Tuohy takes a curious approach to his story, first writing about Wahoo, then O'Kane's earlier life, and finally Tang and later events, interrupted by chapters on what the rest of the American sub pack was doing. This can sometimes be confusing. And the line-editing in the book is sometimes careless. But \\"The Bravest Man\\" is well worth reading, especially in a year when the USS O'Kane is on watch in the Arabian Sea, carrying the bravest man's name and legacy into the 21st century.	2002-09-01

This is the story of how Air America began, as a private-venture airline in China headed by Claire Chennault of the Flying Tigers. Leary tells the story of how CAT morphed into a para-military force, supporting Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops in their losing battle with the Communists, and eventually retreating with them to Taiwan. There it began to take on odd jobs for the U.S. military, and eventually the CIA bought a piece of it, so that CAT pilots were one day flying supplies to U.S. forces in Korea, again providing the same service for French troops in Vietnam, and between times dropping spies into China. It's a great yarn, though told with professorial precision. A reprint (no changes) of an earlier book from a university press.	2002-08-21

The writing isn't great, which surprised me, since for several years people have been telling me that Stephen Ambrose is the new David McCullough. To tell you the truth, I sometimes found it a bit embarrassing. A smile as wide as all outdoors? That was a cliche when the B-24 was new! (Maybe his earlier books were spellingbinding? I don't know; I haven't read any of them.)<br />I wasn't particularly impressed by the historical depth, either. I know, I know; Ambrose specializes in oral history, so his bibliography is going to be skinny. But I would think he would have read something more current or compelling than &quot;The Army Air Forces in World War II&quot;. (Ch. 5 is a short history of the air war in Europe. Of 26 footnotes, 10 are to the AAF history and 10 more are to Michael Sherry's &quot;The Rise of American Air Power&quot;, which is okay but certainly not the last word on the subject.) For example: Richard Ardrey's &quot;Bomber Pilot&quot;, which is about B-24s, written by a B-24 pilot and commander who flew on some of the raids mentioned by Ambrose. Or &quot;The Day We Bombed Switzerland&quot;. If he'd done some exploration, he might have concluded that the B-24 wasn't quite the wonderful plane he believes.<br />Then too, Ambrose is not a pilot, and it shows. People said the same thing about my first military-aviation book, so I set out to learn to fly. Looking back, there isn't much that I would change after 200 hours at the controls. (The novel &quot;Remains&quot; was written before I started flight training. When I revised it for publication, I added just one sentence, about the lovely feeling of flaring to land; the rest looked pretty good to me, though I'm sure a P-40 pilot could poke some holes into it.) Ambrose's naivete shows through when he writes about the experience of flight, and also when he sets out to explain what a B-24 is and how it differs from other aircraft. This stuff is so simple-minded that it belongs in a book for children, not a best-seller for adults.<br />Finally, it turns out that the really good stuff in &quot;The Wild Blue&quot; was lifted almost without change from Thomas Childers's &quot;Wings of Morning&quot;. (He also lifted the title, by the way, from a novel by Walter Boyne.)	2002-05-29

Actually, I think it's the other way around.<br />I lived in Europe for four years in the 1950s. Faulks's descriptions of London and Brussels were so real that reading them was like a hallucination. I was reading my own memories, and not 45-year-old ones either, but London and Paris in the rain, at night, just a few years ago. Or so it seemed. I've read many hundreds of novels in my life, though as I get older I prefer history to fiction. But in all the great novels I've read, none has had that effect on me. It was a bit scary, really. Faulks is truly a gifted writer.<br />On the other hand, I've been in the army (two years of that European sojourn was as a soldier in France) and I've seen a bit of war. I reacted to Faulks's war scenes much as I did to the film Saving Private Ryan: great pyrotechnics, but not really convincing. This was especially true of the march across No Man's Land and the battles underground in the tunnels: all the while I was reading them, I knew without question that Faulks was simply making it up out of accounts he had read.<br />So yes, it's a grand book. I read it over two days when I had a lot else to do. But it's not about World War I; it's about modern people seeking the truth about World War I (and not finding it, in my opinion).	2002-04-02

It's a delightful romp through 100-plus years of the Metropolitan Opera. The folks on the opera newsgroup enjoy trashing it, but the nits they pick are mostly trivial. They also say that Ms Fielder has merely rehashed other books for the early history of the Met, but since I haven't read those, it was all news to me, with the single exception of the Vanderbilt sandpile filled with jewelery. Similarly, the new stuff was mostly a revelation, and only the story of Kathleen Battle in the back seat of her limo, telephoning her agent so that he could telephone the driver and tell him to tune the air conditioning, was a repeat to me.<br />By today's standards, Molto Agitato is brilliantly edited, with few or no typographical errors or solecisms. <br />I'd give it 5 stars except that it is clumsily organized. Any author would have problems making a coherent whole out of 100 years and dozens of personalities, but every once in a while Fieldler changes subjects so quickly or leaps out of her chronology so drastically that it's a bit bewildering. Even the ending, to me, was flat: a performance about to begin, about which we hear nothing further.<br />But this is the best book I've read so far, and it will serve until those smart guys on rec.music.opera write about all the nits they know.	2001-12-30

Not only was he accepted, with two prosthetic legs and several years older than most of &quot;the Few&quot;, but the RAF returned him to fighter-plane duty. He became a leading ace until he was shot down, and then he became such a pain to the Germans that they had to take his legs away from him to stop him from escaping. <br />You may remember Brickhill as the author of The Great Escape. This is another spellbinding yarn. Note however that it is more of an inspirational story than a serious biography. In the days when youngsters were more literate than they are today, it would have been called a &quot;boy's book.&quot; <br />My son-in-law (who is English) gave an earlier version of this book to me for a Christmas present.

Flying on such a day was pure joy. Smooth, dense, misty morning air slowly released its grip as light emerged from the countryside, fulfilling the promise of another day. Our fears vanished as we soared above the sleeping ground. We were immortal. From our perch above the commotion, we watched the world come to life to begin another day of killing.&quot;<br />Normally I'm turned off by the High Literary Style, but the way that passage ends with the knife-twist--&quot;another day of killing&quot;--redeems it with room to spare. Time and again in Schultz's book, he and his collaborator pull off that neat trick: loving memories entangled with the ordinariness of war.<br />(Like the time Schultz lands Janey in a vineyard that turns out to be a German minefield. He's full of morning coffee, and one of his great hopes on landing was to empty his bladder. There's nothing for it! He just has to piss his pants.)<br />Schultz and Janey fly and fight with the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division through North Africa, Sicily, the Anzio beachhead and the advance to Rome, and finally the invasion of southern France. They both survive--quite an accomplishment, not only for the pilot but especially for the Piper Cub. Among other tricks, they take off from an LST &quot;aircraft carrier&quot; whose tiny plywood deck is greatly supplemented by 24 knots of wind over the bow: <br />Of course I am sappy about Piper Cubs. But I really enjoyed this book, and I recommend it highly.	2001-11-13

I checked in here to see what others were saying about this book, which I bought the other day and am now reading.<br />From all that I have heard of Ambrose (from my wife among others) he is supposed to be a splendid writer-historian in the mold of David McCullough. I am dismayed by what I have read so far. <br />Ambrose clearly knows nothing about flying, and hard as it is to believe (for a man who's made his reputation with WWII books) he doesn't seem to know very much about the military either. <br />There are spelling mistakes (he writes \\"peal\\" when he means \\"peel\\"). Some sentences are incomprehensible even after a second and third reading. He writes about living in barracks and living in tents as if they were the same thing. He says a guy learned to fly and soloed on an AT-10, which is an advanced, twin-engined transition trainer for pilots learning how to fly bombers. And so it goes!<br />I keep hoping I will soon be caught up in a great war adventure, but so far I am reminded more of Martin Caidin Inc than David McCullough.<br />If I change my mind, I'll report back and add some stars.	2001-09-07

Hey, it's about the British effort, which was considerable! I thought Smith was more than fair to the American effort, which he concedes was larger and often faster. The point is: it took both British and American expertise (and contrasting attitudes) to do the job.<br />The most valuable lesson here is that the codes (neither German nor Japanese) were never entirely broken. The codebreaker's job was almost as arduous in August 1945 as it was in November 1941. How they did their work is endlessly fascinating.	2001-09-05

I read it in about 36 hours, starting one afternoon after work and finishing the next. So it's a page-turner. No problem there: he's still a very handy writer. But I didn't particularly like the \\"hero,\\" and I especially disliked the wife of the beer-truck driver who arranges for him to get her dead husband's hand, who claims visiting rights with the hand, and whom he finally marries. God, I'm thinking, don't marry that woman! Don't move to Green Bay! Are you crazy? Yes, he was crazy to marry her, and I was crazy to spend my hours reading this book.<br />I have to say my wife and daughter had the same reaction--despised the book, but read it nonstop. I was embarrassed to put it on my shelf and equally embarrassed to give it to a friend, so I handed it off to the university library. They have trouble keeping John Irving books on the shelf--students steal them. That will become less of a problem in the future if he doesn't revert to his former genius.<br />Meanwhile, avoid this book. Go back and read Setting Free the Bears, or any of his later and more famous books. <br />-- Dan Ford	2001-08-13

Writing about Chennault isn't an easy job (I know, because I wrote a history of the AVG) because he was part genius, part crackpot, and all-over trouble for his superiors. Byrd did a superlative job of sorting myth from fact, and of telling the unvarnished truth about Chennault without ever losing sight of his great humanity and his tactical brilliance.

Unlike such gotcha! publications as the Seagraves' The Yamato Dynasty, this book relies almost entirely on Japanese sources. It is streets ahead of Yamato, and even such earlier attempts as those by David Bergamini.<br />In the end, of course, Bix fails to find the smoking gun. The Japanese simply did too good a job of obscuring the emperor's role and protecting him after the war (an effort supported by General MacArthur for very good reasons). But the issue of whether or not Hirohito was a war criminal is now beside the point. His story is a fascinating one, and it sheds light on the way Japan was governed during the 1930s and 1940s. The important thing is to expand our understanding, and Bix does just that, even though the final verdict on Hirohito must the the Scotch one of &quot;not proven.&quot;	2001-08-02

(as far as p. 169 :)	This is a wonderful story, brilliantly told, insofar as the tragedy of the Indianapolis is concerned. No wonder Peter Maas (author of another martime spellbinder, The Terrible Hours) was drawn to it. But just as the Maas book began to sag a bit after the Squalus crew was rescued, this one droops altogether. My advice is to read as far as page 169, when the story at sea is done, and skip the bit about the court-martial and what followed.<br />The problem, I think, is that Richard Newcomb (like the Navy) was trying to find a scapegoat. Surely a cruiser can't sink and leave 800 men in the water undiscovered for five days? That's what the U.S. public asked in 1945, and it's what Newcomb asked in 1958 when he wrote this book, and of course in our post-Vietnam wariness of the military it's what we're supposed to think today. <br />But drek happens. If anyone was guilty, it was the port personnel on Guam who didn't assign a destroyer escort to the Indianapolis. This doesn't seem to occur to anyone, least of all the Navy. But absent an escort, in time of war, with enemy submarines about, the Navy's procedure for routing combat ships was the right one. Too bad the Indianapolis proved that it wouldn't work under every possible circumstance, and that the disaster happened in the last week of the war.	2001-05-28

His book belongs on the shelf of every student of the Green Berets.<br />It's not a knock-you-dead combat yarn like Jim Morris's &quot;War Story&quot;--Archer didn't really serve what you could call a combat tour in Vietnam. He was there much earlier, knocking about Southeast Asia in the years before there was a Vietnam War (or American War, as the Vietnamese prefer to call it). He was in Laos, Thailand, the Philippines, and of course Vietnam when the Green Berets were first staking out their claim to fame, and when men like Archer created the jungle-training practices that would make Special Forces the most effective American combat arm in South Vietnam.<br />To me, the most interesting anecdote is the account of the American training mission that was attacked by the Viet Cong as it graduated its first class of Vietnamese Special Forces. Officially, Captain Harry Cramer died of an accidental explosion, and he wasn't even listed on The Wall (the Vietnam war memorial in Washington, D.C.) until 1983. In fact, as Archer recalls, Crame died in a mortar attack, and he was the first American to be killed in that long war--21 October 1957.  <br />This is a slight book--just 138 pages. How it can be priced at more than forty bucks is beyond me, so I'm glad to see that there are cut-rate copies available from the vendors of new-used books on this site.	2001-05-09

As time goes on and memories fade, more and more Americans have come to regard the Japanese as victims of World War II. Sure, they bombed Pearl Harbor, but was that any reason we should have dropped an atomic bomb on them?<br />In fact, Imperial Japan and especially the Imperial Japanese Army (it's worthwhile to distinguish between the two) ran a killing and torture machine that in many respects was the equal of Hitler's Germany. The Kempeitai did much of this work. Officially, it was only the army's police force, but it was feared by Japanese civilians, by the captive populations of Asia, and especially by prisoners of war. <br />Unfortunately, Lamont-Brown is a professional writer of books, with 50-odd to his credit in a bit more than 30 years--a British Martin Caidin, if you like. Nobody can turn out books at that rate and spend the necessary time in research. As a result, this is mostly a collection of anecdotes and unrelated themes--whatever Lamont-Brown turned up, he shaped the book around that, or so it seems. So it fails both as a serious history of the Kempeitai and as an indictment of the Japanese way of making war.<br />But it's the only one we have, and therefore worth reading. However, if your interest lies mostly with the fate of Anglo-American prisoners of war, then a better book to start with is Gavan Daws, Prisoners of the Japanese.	2001-01-02

Their treatment was  barbarous--often literally worse than death. Of Japan's white  prisoners, about 27 percent died in captivity, compared to about  3 percent of Anglo-Americans in German prison camps (the Russians  were another matter).<br />Gavan Daws has crafted a masterful history of these  unfortunates, following some of them throughout their  nearly-four-year ordeal. He divides them into &quot;clans,&quot; which is  both a useful way to remember diverse people as they appear and  reappear in the narrative, and also a way to drive home his point  about survival: that to be a member of a clan was to have a  better chance to live through the hell of a Japanese prison camp.<br />The survival rates of the white prisoners was markedly  dissimilar. The Dutch fared the best, in part because as  colonialists they were familiar both with the climate and the  bugs, and in part because they were imprisoned on the islands in  which they had lived. The British did fairly well--their military  caste system was very effective, even in captivity, and when  officers were housed separately, the sergeants took command, and  if the sergeants were murdered, then the corporals took over.<br />The highest death rate was among the Americans. They were a  number of reasons for this: the Japanese treated them worse than  the other white prisoners; a number of them were civilian workers  captured at Wake, who had no military training; and of course the  frontier ethic that encouraged Americans to fend for themselves.  Of all the white prisoners, only the Americans were known to have  turned on each other, killing their fellows to obtain food or  even to drink their blood and thus avoid dying from thirst.<br />Anyone with an interest in the Pacific War should read this  book.	2001-01-02

There are serious problems with this book. Sakai wrote his memoirs in Japanese, of course. These were then translated into English by Fred Saito. To dress them up for an American audience, the publisher got the prolific aviation writer Martin Caidin to lend his name &amp; talent to the project.<br />The result is a narrative that is often far removed from history. Sakai made mistakes, as all combat pilots do in claiming their victories and recalling their battles. These were exacerbated by Saito's translation, and further hyped by Caidin, who knew no Japanese.<br />The book I read was the original Bantam War Books version. It was later published by Naval Institute Press, but I don't know if any of the errors were corrected or at least pointed out. Nor can I tell from the Amazon information whether this is a reprint of the NIP edition, though I assume it is.<br />Buy it, read it, but don't take anything for granted.	2000-12-30

That's a consequence of Ienaga's belief that the war actually began with the Japanese army's 1931 coup in Manchuria, which led inevitably to war with China, which in turn led to the wider war agaisnt the western Allies. Despite Japan's claims about liberating Asians from colonialism, its purpose in going to war was to obtain the raw materials with which to defeat China. That was one reason the Japanese treated the &quot;liberated&quot; peoples so badly--as badly as they treated their white PWs. <br />Part of the blame goes to the Japanese military tradition, in which the officers were an elite and the troops were conscripted from the younger sons of tenant farmers. Brutality was the norm, and the enlisted men who stayed in the army and became sergeants were precisely those who would most brutalize the next batch of recruits. Draftees were called issen gorin--roughly, &quot;penny postcards,&quot; because that was the cost and the method of obtaining one. Why husband the life of a soldier when he could be replaced for a penny? Ienaga explains that the enlisted soldiers were the bottom of the food chain, that they had no on upon whom to vent their brutality in return. <br />During WWII, it was fashionable in the U.S. to show General Tojo as the Japanese dictator, making a trio with Germany's Hitler and Italy's Mussolini. But of course that was very far from true, as even American propaganda recognized, since sometimes the emperor Hirohito filled the same role. Ienaga is especially good at explaining this mystery, in which a dictator was imposed by a group of elder statesmen--then deposed when his usefulness was over. Tojo ruled the government and the army, but he never managed to rule the navy--he didn't even learn about the defeat at Midway until a month after four aircraft carriers and a major portion of the navy's fighter planes had gone to the bottom. <br />This is a valuable book, one of only a half-dozen serious studies by Japanese scholars of World War II available in English.

Akamatsu's men killed  the emissaries.&quot; <br />It's bad enough when you read this stuff written  by an American, but when it comes from a Japanese writer it's  really unsettling. Saburo Ienaga was a high-school teacher during  the war and a university professor afterward; he got into trouble  with the authorities for trying to bring some balance to the  high-school history texts in the 1950 and 1960s, when the Cold  War and the end of the U.S. occupation allowed the schools to  gloss Japan's role in World War II. I read this book when I was  researching the Flying Tigers, but to sit down and read it on its  own merits was a revelation.<br />Americans may be startled to pick up a 256-page book about the  Pacific War and discover that Pearl Harbor isn't mentioned until  page 135, more than halfway through. That's a consequence of  Ienaga's belief that the war began with the Japanese army's 1931  coup in Manchuria, which led inevitably to war with China, which  in turn led to the wider war that began in December 1941. Despite  Japan's claims about liberating Asians from white colonialism,  its purpose in going to war with the Americans, British, and  Dutch was to obtain the raw materials with which to prosecute the  war in China. That was one reason the Japanese treated the  &quot;liberated&quot; people so badly--as badly as their treated their  prisoners of war, which was as bad as anything east of the German  death camps.<br />Part of the blame goes to the Japanese military tradition, in  which the officers were an elite and the troops were conscripted  from the younger sons of tenant farmers.Brutality was the norm,  and the enlisted men who stayed in the army and became sergeants  were precisely those who would most brutalize the next batch of  recruits.

Why husband the life of a soldier when he could be replaced  for a penny? Ienaga explains that the enlisted soldiers were the  bottom of the food chain, that they had no on upon whom to vent  their brutality in return. (He was wrong, of course: the Korean  labor guards were lower, and the prisoners and captive peoples  were lower still, and it was they who suffered the lash for every  indignity visited upon the common soldiers.) <br />Yet the same army was notably humane during the Russo-Japanese  War. Why the difference? The Imperial Japanese Army lost its  humanity in China, where national pride became the ugliest kind  of racism. &quot;Chinka, Chinka, Chinka,&quot; as the translator renders a  poem that appeared in Japanese schools in the 1930s: &quot;they're  ugly and they stinka.&quot; A grade-school boys would be told that his  duty and his privilege when he grew up would be to kill &quot;hundreds of  Chinese.&quot; (Military training began in elementary school, and each middle school had a military cadre to lead the boys in drill.)<br />During World War II, it was fashionable in the U.S. to show  General Tojo as the Japanese dictator, making a trio with  Germany's Hitler and Italy's Mussolini.

Tojo ruled the government and the  army, but he never managed to rule the navy--he didn't even learn  about the defeat at Midway until a month after four aircraft  carriers and a major portion of the navy's fighter planes had  gone to the bottom. <br />In fact, the army and navy controlled the  government (including Tojo), with occasional input from the  emperor and the elder statesmen (basically, everyone who had ever  served as prime minister). It was an intricate web, and often  enough the real power was exercised not by the generals but by  colonels and majors in the field. <br />Ienaga wasn't disloyal, nor was he one of those who curried  favor with the Occupation by writing what the Americans wanted to  hear. He savages the United States for using the atomic bomb on  Japanese cities--an atrocity that he ranks with Germany's death  camps and Japan's Rape of Nanjing.  More sobering, in a book written in 1968, he accuses the  U.S. of acting as the new Imperial Japanese Army. We were the  brutal overlords in Vietnam, as Japan had been in China--while  Japan itself played the ignominious role of the Manchukou puppet  state of the 1930s and 1940s, dutifully supporting the aggressor.  It is an uncomfortable comparison. <br />This is a valuable book, and one of only a half-dozen serious studies  by Japanese scholars of World War II that are available in  English.

But as he famously said: &quot;Show me a hero, and I'll show you a bum.&quot; He did the best to prove his own maxim.<br />As a member of the Flying Tigers of Burma and China, he was credited with two Japanese aircraft shot down, but left early and in such disfavor that he got a &quot;dishonorable discharge&quot; from its commander, Claire Chennault. He then re-joined the Marines and proceeded to build an unorthodox fighter squadron--the Black Sheep--with many similarities to the Tigers, with himself playing the role of Chennault. Shot down, he was awarded the Medal of Honor while serving time in two of Japan's most notorious prisons. He emerged alive at the end of the war, claiming to have accounted for enough Japanese planes on his final day to make him the leading USMC ace of World War II.<br />It's a fascinating story, but Bruce Gamble goes beyond the war record to show us the boy growing up in a troubled family and following his seemingly doomed path to alcoholism and brawling and a troubled marriage of his own. Boyington's checkered career postwar is equally compelling. You feel sorry for him, angry at him, and in awe of him as one of the great shooters of all time.<br />This is a brilliant book and an important one, and it belongs on the shelf of anyone with an interest in World War II aviation.	2000-11-30

He had a dogfight with a Zero (no damage done on either side) and a harrowing flight through the clouds without IFR instruments, while Japanese ack-ack shells exploded around him and fast American bombers dashed through the soup beside him.

They pile photo upon photo, so generously that sometimes (in the case of Myrha's book) the editors sometimes print the same photo twice. My favorite in this case is the picture that shows an early flying-wing glider in the Hortens' dining room, the wing extending through the door into the next room. <br />The weak point of the Schiffer organization is that they don't seem to edit their books. Printing the same photo twice is one result. Another is that the most important single fact in the book--the day the Hortens first flew an all-wing aircraft--appears to be wrong by a year.<br />Never mind! We won't get a better treatment of these German geniuses (well, one genius anyhow, and one brave test pilot) who created aircraft that were 50 years ahead of their time. When the Americans occupied Germany in May 1945, they found a Horten all-wing fighter-bomber on the assembly line, all but ready for combat. In theory, it would have been capable of Goering's dictat that any new warplane must meet a 1,000 X 3 performance envelope: carry 1000 kg of bombs 1000 km at a speed of 1000 km/ph. If the war had gone on a few more months, the Allies might have encountered a surprise as nasty as the Messerschmitt jet and rocket-powered interceptors.<br />There was even a plan on the drawing board for a Horten &quot;Amerika Bomber&quot; capable of carting a non-explosive atomic bomb to New York. (The Germans, unable to achieve a chain reaction, figured that radioactive debris would serve as well to destroy a city.)<br />For the serious collector.	2000-11-25

On the opening day of the Pacific War, Wake was bombed and strafed by island-based                planes of the Japanese navy. When the raiders left, seven Grumman F4F Wildcats were                wrecked on the ground. <br />               With five remaining fighters, U.S. Marine Corps pilots defended the atoll for two desperate                weeks. They shot down two Mitsubishi G3M land-based bombers, two Nakajima B5N                carrier bombers, and a Kawanishi flying boat--and sank a destroyer with a device intended                for water-filled practice bombs. They cannibalized wrecked Wildcats and refilled oxygen                bottles from tanks belonging to the welders who had been building the island defenses. And                when their last Wildcat was shot down, they took up rifles and fought as infantrymen. <br />               The defense of Wake is an old story, but Cressman uses Japanese accounts to freshen                and inform the telling. He can get carried away with nomenclature--writing &quot;a shotai of three                kansen&quot; when &quot;a flight of three Zeros&quot; would be easier and no less accurate--but in battle                after battle he identifies the pilots in opposing aircraft, and confirms or denies 54-year-old                victory claims. He makes good use of Japanese photos, too, including the B5N that                darkens the sky on the dust jacket. <br />               A relief force was dispatched from Hawaii, built around the carrier Saratoga with two fighter                squadrons, including 14 Brewster F2A Buffaloes that were to land on Wake and replace the                lost Wildcats. Their ETA was Christmas Eve. The Japanese got there first, and the                Americans turned away without launching a plane or firing a shot. As so often in that winter                of 1941-42, the United States was a day late and a carrier short.	2000-11-25

Moore is quick to point out that the hazards of flying 800 feet above the Philippines paled in comparison to combat on the ground: war is hell, but his war was \\"more funky than demonic.\\" <br /> Moore once had a dogfight with a Zero: two cannon and two machineguns vs. a Piper Cub armed only with a carbine. As long as the planes were closely entwined, Moore had the upper hand, since he could turn inside the Japanese fighter. Then the Zero moved off, setting up for a fast attack that the 65 hp Cub couldn't have dodged. Moore dove for home, and he and his rear-seat \\"gunner\\" were out of the Cub and into a trench before the Zero passed over. <br /> More terrifying, actually, was the time he was sucked into a cloud. Anti-aircraft guns were popping off beneath him, U.S. bombers roaring through the cloud beside, and Moore had to fly IFR with only a compass, tachometer, airspeed indicator, and altimeter. Against all logic, he made it home that time as well. Still, as his commander warned him, the odds didn't favor a liaison pilot: \\"All you have to do is fly one of these things long enough, and it will get you.\\" <br /> When Moore doesn't remember the details, he says so. The effect is like a favorite uncle, yarning to his nephews about a 55-year-old adventure so extraordinary that he still can't quite believe that he took part in it. A delightful book.	2000-11-25

It contains no tales of derring-do (&quot;Erik dropped out of                the sky upon the unsuspecting Zero&quot;) and it could do you an injury if you dozed off. <br />               Rather, it presents the best collection of facts, figures, drawings, photos, and anecdotes                about U.S. World War II fighters that I have ever seen, and a whole lot more. For openers,                Dean sketches American fighters of the 1920s and 1930s, along with the planes that might                have fought in World War II but didn't make the grade, often because they were too goofy to                be believed. He also talks about the elements that enable a fighter to fight, including a                wonderfully lucid explanation of aircraft stability. <br />               The main text is given over to the 11 planes that actually went to war, including the                Brewster F2A Buffalo (509 delivered, mostly to desperate foreigners) and the humungous                Northrop P-61 Black Widow (706 delivered, late in the war). Any kid with a yen for model                airplanes or Combat Simulator can name the rest: the shark-faced Curtiss P-40, the rotund                Grumman F4F Wildcat and F6F Hellcat, the burly Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, the                incomparable North American P-51 Mustang. . . . From 1939 to 1945, U.S. manufacturers                built 100,090 combat-worthy fighters. &quot;Today,&quot; Dean notes, &quot;no one could pay for that                number even if they were desired.&quot; <br />               In the Schiffer tradition, photograph is piled upon drawing, table upon graph--74 for the                Brewster Buffalo alone, which U.S. pilots flew in just one engagement, defending Midway on                June 4, 1942. The drawings are generally taken from pilot's manuals and the like, giving a                pleasantly retro look to the pages. <br />               Among such wonders, I was disappointed to find countless errors of spelling and                punctuation, notably &quot;Kittihawk&quot; for the British Kittyhawk version of the big-jawed P-40.                Never mind! Just as nobody will ever build so many fighters again, nobody is likely to                attempt another such labor of love, so we'll have to be content with this one.	2000-11-25

The army wanted a super-bomber in peacetime, and the company designed it as a private                venture. Not until 1940 was there an actual contract--for two planes, out of a fleet that would                number 3,895. They cost $3 billion, making the B-29 the most expensive weapon of World                War II, not excluding the atomic bomb. <br />               Vander Meulen is less interested in the weapon than in the industrial phenomenon--the B-29                as product of a U.S. emerging from depression and despair to find itself the most powerful                country in the world. <br />               Of four factories that built it, the most successful was in Wichita. Kansas offered good                weather, level ground, security from foreign raiders, and thousands of patriotic, hard-working                people with few job opportunities. The magnitude of a $3 billion program in those days can                be gauged by the cost of a meal at Boeing-Wichita (28 cents including soup, coffee, and                pie) and by the hourly wage (75 cents). <br />               You worked 10 hours a day for 12 days, then got two days off. You earned $52.50 a week                on the average, allowing for overtime but not for payroll deductions. Like the Pentagon,                Musak, the preeminence of Boeing as an airframe builder--even many of our airports and                factories--the withholding tax was a product of the war machine that the U.S. became in                World War II. <br />               As an economist, Vander Meulen brings a refreshing perspective to these developments. He                concludes with this arithmetic: for every ton of explosives dropped by a B-29 on Japan, an                American worked 3.4 years to get it there, and a Japanese worked 50 years to repair the                damage.	2000-11-25

What's more, we convinced ourselves that with the proper bombsight we could &quot;drop a bomb in a pickle barrel from 15,000 ft.&quot; McFarland describes the development of the Norden bombsight and how inevitable countermeasures--mostly the &quot;German 88&quot; flak cannon--drove the bombers up to 25,000 feet, from which altitude they were lucky to hit a city, never mind a pickle barrel<br />Meanwhile, the navy (which had dibs on the Norden bombsight) took the wiser course and depended on single-engine dive bombers, whose pilots essentially turned themselves into missile guidance systems.<br />The pursuit of precision bombing ended over Hiroshima, where the best bombardier in the USAAF with no flak, no fighters, and perfect weather managed to miss his target by 800 feet. But with the atomic bomb on board, what did it matter? A miss was literally as good as a mile, and Hiroshima vanished.<br />A good, stolid, valuable history.	2000-11-25

Jim Morris was in the team that replaced these guys a few months later, and he inherited their interpreter, a handsome Montagnard called Cowboy, who unbeknownst to the Americans was a leading figure in an independence movement called Fulro, for Liberation of Oppressed Races.<br />Morris tells his own story--the American story--of his multiple tours as a Green Beret in Vietnam. But running through it is the parallel story of Cowboy, who becomes a warlord in his own right--a sort of &quot;fourth force&quot; in this many-pronged war whose major participants were the South Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese, and the Americans. Cowboy worked for the Americans, plotted for the Montagnard, and may well have been murdered by the South Vietnamese.<br />I just discovered this book last year, when it was recommended to me by one of the Green Berets I'd known in 1964. I'm delighted to see that it's back in print. It belongs on the shelf of any student of the Vietnam war.	2000-11-16

How curious that he has never before had a real biography--just kid stuff, really.<br />Daso has filled the gap with a thorough-going biography combined with a history of the development of US airpower during the first half of the century. Personally, I don't find Arnold a sympathetic figure. He was an indifferent student and even an indifferent aviator. However, he got along with men of power, including President Roosevelt and General George Marshall, and he was a logistical genius. <br />Daso tells the yarn of Arnold getting his advisers together in 1940 and asking them how many planes they needed over the new few years. &quot;Be bold!&quot; he urged them. They came up with a total of about 100. &quot;To hell with you,&quot; Arnold replied, and asked for 100,000.

Fred Libby is a wonderful companion and a tough young man. When luck falls his way, he's wide-eyed with happiness; and when luck turns sour, he shrugs his shoulders and moves on. So it was when he loses his small fortune in an oil-field scam in Canada. What the hey?--he joins the Canadian army as a truck driver, despite the fact that he doesn't know how to drive. The army, he figures, will keep him warm and dry and well fed.<br />But nobody is dry on the Western front in the winter of 1916, so Fred volunteers as an observer for the Royal Flying Corps. On his first outing, he shoots down a German plane, and he is accordingly commissioned as an officer &amp; gentleman. He's as good at shooting down airplanes as he was at breaking wild horses, and he soon has a Military Cross from the hand of King George. The RFC then teaches him to fly, which doesn't take long: he soloes the first day, and he is soon back in action as a pilot. <br />The dustjacket credits him with 10 kills as an observer and 14 as a pilot, which would have made Fred one of the leading American aces of WWI before the U.S. even entered the war, but this is apparently an error. His total score was 14. His military career goes into a tailspin in 1917, when he loyally returns to the U.S. to become a pilot in his home service--never to see combat service, alas, and with a sour taste at the ineptitude of the U.S. Army Air Service.	2000-10-01

Better than anyone else, he evokes the sights, smells,  and sounds of China in 1945, along with an economy so weak that U.S.  dollars were precious enough to be washed and ironed after use, and a  government so depraved that it's a wonder it lasted until 1949. <br />China  Pilot is a a wonderful book.

Conspiracy buffs will love it, especially those who  believe in a Vast Right Wing Conspiracy of Republicans bent on twisting  history to their own money-grubbing advantage.<br />The history of the Meiji,  Taisho, and Showa emperors up to 1945 isn't bad, as opposed what follows.  The Seagraves have a knack for making individuals and situations come  alive. They also have a knack for getting things wrong: MacArthur escaped  from Corregidor by PT boat, not submarine; Japan had army and navy air  forces, not a distinct &quot;Japanese Air Force&quot;; the great fire raid  on Tokyo featured incendiary bombs, not napalm, and it killed about half  the 200,000 cited by the Seagraves; in 1948 Edward Lansdale was a major,  not a general.... <br />More ominously, for a book that purports to give the  inside scoop on the Emperor System, the Seagraves don't read Japanese and  rarely if ever had translations made. For the first half of the book, I  read the copious notes along with the text, and found no instance in which  the Seagraves refer to a Japanese text. I can't be sure of this because I  gave up this practice when I realized that the really interesting stuff was  never supported by a source I knew and trusted. <br />Golden Lily, for  example: as the Seagraves tell the story, Japan looted the nations it  conquered, hid the treasure in caves in caves and sunken ships, and used it  to enrich the emperor, bribe MacArthur and Herbert Hoover, finance the  country's postwar expansion, and fund the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.  Evidently the Seagraves came across some (uncited) informant, then spun a  book around this germ of a story, using whatever English-language sources  they could find.<br />Read it by all means, but don't take it too seriously.	2000-09-04

But Mr. Harwitt's big  mistake was to think that NASM could rewrite history without creating a  firestorm. This was not a case of a liberal beset by conservatives--though  that happened also. It was a case of revisionist history caught by the  facts.<br />In the aftermath of the Enola Gay flap, Mr. Harwitt left NASM, and  the museum has been a better place for his departure. I've seen the change  in my visits there. There is a nice balance now between veterans of the  military air services on the one hand, and academic museum curators on the  other. This balance is going to be difficult to maintain in the future, as  the worlds of academia and the military grow farther apart. But the tenure  of Admiral Don Engen (and now his Marine Corps successor) has been a great  advance over the Harwitt years.<br />My advice is not to bother with this  apologia, and instead to read some of the worthwhile books written by NASM  staff members like Don Lopez and Robert Mikesh.	2000-08-16

It's a work of art, and the repetition that some reviewers  complain about is part of the art: we keep moving up to the moment when the  young men burn to death; then we back off and approach the horror from  another angle.<br />The Smokejumpers were soldiers, and this is a tribute to  the blind courage of youth, that launches itself into danger without  thinking of the consequences. It's no accident that the only man to survive  on the fire side of the ridge was the older man, the foreman,  &quot;Wag&quot; Dodge, who with equally incredible courage lit a small  grass fire, then lay down in the ashes and let the firestorm pass over  him.<br />Read it, and hope that you will never be tested as these young men  were tested.	2000-08-08

But  meanwhile he fought at Chosin, and he was magnificent.)<br />The campaign  began on Thanksgiving Day, when the Chinese appeared in force at Chosin,  and ended about two weeks later when the marines walked into Hungnam, where  ships were waiting to evacuate them. The distance was 78 miles. In that  narrow space, 10,000 marines fought their way through an estimated 120,000  Chinese soldiers, losing about half their number to capture, death, wounds,  and frostbite. Temperatures were routinely below zero, even without  accounting for wind chill. Men were bayoneted or beaten to death in their  sleeping bags, because the zippers had frozen and rifles wouldn't fire.  More than once, a squad of Chinese and a squad of marines passed each other  without admitting the others' presence, too beaten to fight. Other times,  the Chinese swamped marine positions in what became known as &quot;human  wave&quot; attacks.<br />It was a magnificent moment in marine history, and  this is a stunning book.	2000-07-12

They move from theater to theater with the skill of novelists; they eschew the weasel word  &quot;Nazi&quot; unless they're actually talking about the German political  system; and they deride the conventional wisdom about the ineffectiveness  of the Anglo-American bombing campaign. (Germany had 10,000 flak cannon  targeted against Allied bombers, compared to 8,200 against Russian tanks.  How different the war in the east would have been, if those 10,000 guns and  500,000 Luftwaffe gunners and support personnel had been freed for the  eastern front!)<br />The commanders fare rather badly. The authors detest  MacArthur (no surprise there) but are equally harsh on Bradley, Clark, and  King. Montgomery gets mixed reviews, as does Rommell and the German high  command, most of whom were thorough-going Nazis with little grasp of  strategy. Indeed, the only place where the German military gets unreserved  praise is for its mastery of &quot;combined arms&quot; on the battlefield.  Time and again, Allied armies fight isolated battles against a weaker  German force that prevails (or at least escapes) by virtue of the fact that  air, armor, infantry, and artillery worked together, and this across the  entire front. <br />Japanese commanders get off more lightly--they  accomplished so much with so little--but the brutality of the Japanese  military still sickens after all these years. The same of course is true of  the German military, and not just in the east. (Americans who get bent out  of shape over the execution of Private Slovik should know that between  13,000 and 15,000 German soldiers were executed for subversion, desertion,  or disobedience in the front lines--not to mention tens of thousands sent  to near-certain death in penal battalions.) The difference really comes  down to numbers: the Japanese murdered their captives by the hundreds of  thousands, while the Germans murdered them by the millions. They were rogue  nations, and God protect us from seeing their like again.<br />&quot;A War To  Be Won&quot; has errors and omissions, of course--no two men can get  everything right with respect to the greatest catastrophe of the 20th  century, if not all human history. But what a great try!	2000-06-15

He literally wrote the book on the outbreak of December 1941--&quot;Read This Only and the War Is Won,&quot;  which appears as an appendix to this narrative history of the Malaya  campaign. Tsuji later turns up in the Philippines, Guadalcanal, and China,  where he earned immortality of sorts by cooking and serving the liver of an  American pilot. He was a tactical genius and a monster, and this was only  one of his campaigns, and only one of his books.

Would the invasion  of Japan really have cost the lives of a million American  soldiers, or were the Japanese eager to give up? And hey, what  about those Russians?<br /><br />People  know amazingly little about the Pacific War, compared  to the epic conflict  between the white nations in Europe. Indeed,  the first two weeks of August  1945 loom larger for the chattering  classes than do the four years that  preceded them--eight years if  you date the war from the invasion of China  proper--fourteen  years if you consider that it started with Japan's  annexation of  Manchuria. I've been reading about the events of August 1945  for  a decade, and I have to say that the analysis gets better as the   years go by. Richard Frank's book is the best yet.<br />(The answers are yes,  probably, no, no, and they didn't have much to do with the surrender.)	2000-05-28

He's especially interesting on  the British side, since the RAF's accomplishments in the Pacific haven't  received much attention from historians. If you don't know anything about  the Flying Tigers, this might suggest the books you ought to read, and if  you've read them all, this is a helpful review--though the author tends to  give all sources equal weight, and (sometimes for that reason) he gets some  of the facts wrong.	2000-05-10

Here he puts his research skills into re-creating the original Blitzkreig against Poland, the Battle of Britain, and other epochal campaigns of WWII. (Not the Battle of Midway, alas.) Shores uses documents from both sides, and he is nothign if not thorough, so his text can sometimes be hard to  follow. Four-color paintings, tables of organization, and sidebars about  pilots and planes help make the reader's task easier. One of the consistent  findings is how enthusiastically fighter pilots from all air forces  exaggerated their victories.	2000-04-18

The most astonishing conjunction is the torture of Eric Lomax and his mates, followed immediately by Bill Laurence's account of the Nagasaki bombing.

Sakaida is an American of Japanese heritage  who learned the language in order to research and write about WWII air  battles, using material from both sides. Here he applies his language and  research skills to tell the story of the Japanese Army Air Force that  fought in China and Southeast Asia, and that for much of the war had the  prime responsibility for home defense.

Chennault's &quot;autobiography&quot; was written in 1949 just as the Chinese Nationalist government and his airline were starting life anew on  Taiwan. The text was written by Robert Hotz, with the chapters okayed by  the Old Man. They express his views fairly, but Hotz did not have all the  documents available to him, and Chennault was too busy to fill in the  details.
