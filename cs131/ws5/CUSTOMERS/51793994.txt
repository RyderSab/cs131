Super System, Play Poker Like the Pros, Ciaffone's Book, Cloutier and McEvoy, and numerous others, and I can say that this is by far the best book on NL Hold Em that is out there. <br /> <br />It is geared towards tournament play, however it is also very helpful with cash games. If Harrington's Volume II is as good as this volume is, the two of them together will collectively become the \\"Bible of NL Poker\\". <br /> <br />One thing about this book though is that it isn't going to be an easy read, and it's not supposed to be.  Don't get me wrong, Harrington writes extremely well, but you have to really be *thinking* as you read this book.  You need to *study* this book and re-read sections and always think to yourself \\"Why is this a good play to make for this particular situation?\\"  The reason you need to do this is because one play that might be right in one situation can be terribly wrong in another situation (as we all should know), so you must constantly remind yourself of what situation you're in, hypothetically, as you read. <br /> <br />I honestly cannot say enough good things about this book. I've read so many books on NL Hold Em, and none of them (not even the classic Super System) come close to this IMO.  Maybe that's because my natural style is closer to \\"Action\\" Dan's style of play, but maybe it's just because this book is indeed the best there is on NL Hold Em.	2005-02-21

A Huge Dissappointment	I'm a NL player, so for me this book is basically worthless because I already own the original Super System and Super System II doesn't update the NL section for some reason.  The NL section of Super System II is 99.9% word-for-word an exact copy of the original Super System.<br /><br />I already know most of Caro's tells, and I play mainly online, so they aren't as useful to me anyway.  Furthermore, Doyle's section about online poker is just full of ridiculously basic things that you can find covered in much more depth elsewhere.<br /><br />If you don't own the original Super System and are interested just in general in poker and would like to learn about all different forms of poker from limit and NL Hold Em, to Razz and Stud, then this is a great book to get.  HOWEVER, this is just a complete waste for a NL player who already owns/read the original Super System.<br /><br />No disrespect to Doyle the man, the myth, and the legend, but to Doyle the editor and author, you could have at least warned us that the NL section wouldn't be updated.	2005-02-17

I learned a few things (I'm a beginner but am just about at the intermediate stage) but it really seemed like it was just that--a FEW things.  You can learn a whole lot more for just as much money by buying a book like Super System or the basic one by Sklanskey &amp; Malmuth.<br />If you're not a 100% beginner there's no reason to buy this book though unless you're trying to either get into the head of Phil maybe, but I'm sure he was careful not to reveal much, if anything. The NL section was fun to read but really not that helpful. It basically boiled down to &quot;You need to use your judgement because anything goes in NL&quot; and &quot;You need to be able to read people&quot; but he doesn't teach us that at all.  Mike Caro teaches you that and experience in a face-to-face environment teaches you that.<br />Overall I didn't love this book but I didn't hate it either--probably because I'm a beginner.  If you're a poker nut who reads EVERY poker book then you'll want to read this.  If you're a 100% beginner, then this might be a place to start.  Otherwise forget about it.	2004-01-16

While little is known of Old Hoss, this book brings to life what he may have been like. It's total speculation but is based upon some fact. If we all like to believe that baseball started in Cooperstown and that the Babe really called his shot, then maybe we'll like to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of Old Hoss. For anyone interested in the life and times of Charles Radbourn this is obviously a must read even though it's mainly speculation. However, this is also a fine peice of literature. It is written more in the style of a novel than of a biography and is just a fun read. Anyone who is into baseball history would surely find this an interesting read.	2003-08-16

Baseball players are taught to say the same old cliches over and over again and shy away from anything that might be construed as controversial. Wells speaks his mind and tells you about the type of stuff that goes on behind the scenes... the goofing and practical jokes players play on each other, john smiley's way of handling marge schott, amazing behind the scenes quotes of George Steinbrenner, his take on steroids in baseball, and so much more. This book is not controversial like it was made out to be. Instead Wells just speaks his mind and tells you his experiences. Wells voice comes through perfectly and it's as if you're talking to him one-on-one in person rather than getting information through a media outlet. Excellent book.. a quick read but a great look into baseball behind the scens and into the career of David Wells.	2003-08-16

Not a bad text to learn the basics of E&amp;M out of but there are better texts out there.  Jackson is way too hard to study as a first book on the subject but Good I think is a little on the too easy side.  Not that it should be hard to read and work through a book if you are somewhat intelligent, but Good could get a little more advanced toward the end of each chapter than he does and add some advanced problems at the end of each chapter.<br />It's really not a bad first text to read but I wouldn't recommend an undergrad institution use it for their E&amp;M courses because there is a LARGE gap between Good and Jackson.<br />If this was a Dover book that was cheaper, softcover, and not meant to be an undergrad text I might rate it higher but since it is meant to be an undergrad text I think it comes up a little short.	2002-11-04

This is a great book and Shankar really makes things clear and understandable.  The problem solving techniques that Shankar taught me were applicable to many of the problems in Sakurai even though Sakurai never mentioned those techniques.<br />This book is more advanced than Griffiths but eases you into the Sakurai-level QM with the first couple chapters and I found that very instructive.<br />If I had already studied Griffiths and had a choice between Shankar and Sakurai, I'd pick Shankar.

If used in a course there is no need to supplement it with other texts (although it can't hurt) but for self-study I might recommend pairing it with Shankar although it would still be fine on its own.  The author rarely skips steps in proofs/derivations and the exercises at the end of each chapter are challenging yet rarely as frustrating as certain Jackson problems.  Sorry, no solutions to problems in the back but you can find certain solutions on the web and many of the problems are made such that it's easy to know whether you have the right answer or not.  IMHO the whole book is written well, not just the first 3 chapters as some other reviewers have stated.  Of all the intro graduate level texts out there on QM, this is one of my favorites.  Only Shankar beats it in overall clarity yet Shankar is at a slighty lower level.	2001-12-08

This is NOT true at all.  There are literally 3 equation in the whole book and they are all simple ones such as K^(1/2) = c / v , where 'c' is speed of light in vacuum, 'v' is velocity of light in material, and K is dieletric permittivity.  The other 2 equations are just as simple.  This is not at all suited for the &quot;technically oriented&quot; and it is not at all suited for anyone interested in the electromagnetic theory behind GPR.  It does cite some papers that might be of use for those who are interested in the real theory behind GPR, but otherwise it is pretty soft science.	2001-11-17

This is an excellent textbook for graduate level students and beyond but the problems at the end of the chapters are close to full blown research projects.  It's not that they aren't interesting, but most of them are so difficult that even bright graduate students must resort to working in groups, scouring the internet for previous solutions, and then putting in many more hours of study in order to complete just 2-5 problems a week.  Sure the problems are fun to play with in your spare time, but they are so time consuming and time would be better spent working more problems that were slightly easier or reading/covering extra material.  This text should certainly be on everyone's shelf who is serious about the subject and all graduate students should study it, but the problems are torture.	2001-10-09

A high school student could easily follow this--which might be a good thing in certain cases--but the rigor is lacking.  In fact, there is barely a hint of any rigor whatsoever.  It is mostly intuitive arguments and the author often says things like &quot;but we won't bother worrying about mathematical technicalities&quot;.  It does get you to be able to visualize certain things well, but the visualization techniques can be found in other books also.  The book is very thin and a quick read--hardly worth the money they are trying to get for it.  If you're really at the undergraduate level and want to learn some topology, try something like Mendelson's &quot;Introduction to Topology&quot; by Dover or one of the excellent topology books in the series &quot;Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics&quot; by Springer.  Munkres is also a classic.  If you're not an undergraduate in a math related field and just want to know about the ideas behind topology or perhaps see some visualization techniques, try something like &quot;The Shape of Space&quot; by Weeks.  Overall I was very disappointed with this text.  If you could purchase this book for under $20 it might be worth it, but even then I think the other books I quoted are better in both price and substance.	2001-06-08

I especially like the treatment of the uncertainty principle done in this text and many of the side comments made are very interesting.  It is not perfect however, as there are no solutions to problems and some of the later chapters have errors.  You can download an errata list at the author's web site though and many of the problems are the types that you can be fairly certain if you have the right answer or not.  If you want to just read it and not work many problems it can get a little annoying because in deriving some results Griffiths will often say something like &quot;and because of the theorem you proved in problem 2.4, we see that...&quot;  This book is also a bit overpriced in my mind, but so are almost all of the serious intro QM texts.  I've seen other reviewers saying that Griffiths is not very rigorous and I believe that these reviewers must be either mathematicians or people who already knew the subject before reading the book.  It is fine on the rigor for an intro text in my mind and since it is a standard QM text in many undergraduate physics programs it looks as though some people agree with me.  In many ways I like Liboff better than this text, yet Griffiths is better than Liboff in many ways also.  Two two texts complement each other yet put a dent in your wallet.  If only Dover could get ahold of the two!	2001-06-07

Still, the lectures contained hererin present material in new and enlightening ways.  Even if you already know the material through a different text, Feynman will get you thinking about things you never thought about and might make things more conceptually clear.  The lectures read quite well and often can be read out of order.

To begin with, I think this text is overpriced.  It is a shame that it is overpriced because that is the only reason I gave it less than five stars.  I believe it to be too expensive because it is a relatively quick read.<br />Now if you are not familiar with generalizations of complex numbers such as the quaternions and the cayley numbers, this is an excellent introduction to them.  By the end of the book you will understand why, depending on how you define the word 'interesting', the only 'interesting' algebras are those of the reals, complex, quaternions, and cayleys (up to isomorphism).  The proofs of Frobenius' and Hurwitz's Thms. are wonderful.<br />One thing I must say about this book is that it is truly amazing how there is no prerequisite besides our familiar algebra!  This book is great for undergraduates and would be a nice supplement for someone taking a first abstract algebra course.  Again, I cannot believe how readable the book is.  An advanced reader could probably blow through this book in a few days, but again it does prove the theorems of Hurwitz and Frobenius with such clarity that an advanced reader not familiar with these wonderful theorems would certainly enjoy the later parts of this book.	2001-05-28

That reviewer also said that he liked Griffiths better.  Well it sounds to me like that reviewer was put in the same position as I was by having to use this book for a introductory QM course rather than the type of course it is suited for--a first course in modern physics or what some people refer to as quantum *physics* rather than mechanics.<br />I agree, Griffiths is much better for intro QM because that is what it was meant for.  But who would use Griffiths for a modern physics course?<br />Aside from the fact that Eisberg and Resnick should not be used for a intro QM course, it is an excellent text that, in my opinion, is the best place to learn modern physics prior to undertaking a full-fledged undergraduate QM course.  It does not have a treatment of special relativity, as most modern texts have, but I would still reccomend professors use this text for a modern physics course even if they have to introduce relativity via handouts and notes--it's just that good.  The selection of problems is excellent and there are answers to selected problems in the back.<br />This text is also an excellent place to study for the GRE physics subject test in that the material in this book is probably the single most important material to know for the test besides classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. There are very few typos also. <br />From the standpoint of a modern physics text, this is by far nothing close to being too verbose.  It strikes a perfect balance between mathematical formalism and plain english explanations--which is a far cry from many modern texts that want to explain everything with words and leave the mathematics totally behind (take a look at Krane for instance!).<br />I havn't seen all the modern physics texts out there, but of those I've seen, this is by far the best.  Serway is not bad if you want something that has an intro to SR in it (I really can't say anything bad about Serway's modern book), but I much prefer to use Eisberg &amp; Resnick and get the SR in a separate course that is devoted to the subject.<br />Contents<br />1) Thermal Radiation and Plank's Postulate 2) Photons--Particlelike Properties of Radiation 3) De Broglie's Postulate--Wavelike Properties of Particles 4) Bohr's Model of the Atom 5) Schroedinger's Theory of QM 6) Solutions of Time-Independent SE 7) One-Electron Atoms 8) Magnetic Dipole Moments, Spin, and Transition Rates<br />9) Multielectron Atoms--Ground States and X-Ray Excitations 10) Multielectron Atims--Optical Excitations 11) Quantum Statistics 12) Molecules 13) Solids--Conductors and Semiconductors 14) Solids--Superconductors and Magnetic Properties 15) Nuclear Models 16) Nuclear Decay and Nuclear Reactions 17) Introduction to Elementary Particles 18) More Elementary Particles	2001-05-26

I can honestly say that this is the best textbook I have ever used in any subject whatsoever.  I do not say this out of a love for Calculus, but out of an appreciation for how pedagogically sound this text is.  All authors should strive for such clarity.<br />As stated, there is no text, in my opinion, more suited towards use in any introductory Calculus series, but this text is also ideal for self-study.  The theory is presented in crystal clear fashion, and then multiple examples are given in order of increasing complexity.  Each chapter culminates with a series of well-chosen problems and odd-numbered problems have answers in the back.  For self-study, the latter detail is of most importance, yet it doesn't end there!  A companion guide is also available (by Heyd) that works out, in detail, many of the odd-numbered problems.<br />The figures within the text are chosen well, so that they demonstrate the matter at hand.  It is *NOT* the case that there are pictures just for the sake of pictures.<br />Short biographical sketches of important mathematicians who developed parts of the calculus are included in the relevant chapters, which I found interesting to read even though it certainly was not assigned reading!  &quot;Career Interview(s)&quot; in which a person who has a career in applied mathematics gives a brief description of what they do are also included at the end of many chapters.<br />I have found the overall setup of the book exceptional in the order in which the chapters are presented and in the location of a multitude of important theorems and formulas that are in the front and back covers.<br />I should also mention that at the end of many of the chapters, a reference is made to a journal article or two &quot;for further reading&quot;.  I found these excellent, as our library subscribed to these journals and they were indeed well-suited for anyone to read who had just completed the chapter at hand.  These articles always had very interesting applications or simply inventive pure mathematics as their topics.  As a student, I am lucky to have taken the initiative to even follow Larson's advice and look into one of these articles.  I would urge anyone teaching from this book to perhaps assign some of those articles as out of class reading or talk about them in class if time permits.<br />I used this text for my series of three four credit courses, Calculus I, II, and III, and I think that adopting this text to use in that series of courses was the best thing the Mathematics Department at my school has done.  Do not be fooled into thinking this is a book that would be of little interest to junior-senior undergrads and 1st-2nd year graduates.  I was amazed when I found out infinite series and vector analysis is sometimes considered &quot;advanced&quot; calculus, even though it is presented here with such clarity that it seems far from advanced. Cheers for Larson! (I refer to the fifth edition above)	2000-12-28

US	51793994	R2YVNWWMEH74OW	1860941982	473214820	Cavitation	Books	3	9	9	N	N	A Fine Book	I'm not sure if I can say that this book is better than Leighton's &quot;The Acoustic Bubble&quot;, but I personally have found it to be more enlightening on certain topics (of course Leighton spends some more time on aspects not covered here, so the books really do compliment each other).  Although there is not a rigorous treatment of all the versions of the RP equation, the derivation of its basic form is quick and elegant, and you may begin studying complex bubble dynamics right from the start.  The less than basic forms of the equation are then introduced with some background on what the new terms accomplish.  The section on sonoluminescence is now somewhat dated, but much of it would still be of interest to a newcomer.  This is not a textbook, ie, there are no problems to work.  Basic knowledge of PDEs is required and knowledge of basic fluid dynamics preferable.	2000-10-21

As far as I have seen, this is the most accessible introduction to the subject.  Any undergraduate who has had calculus, linear algebra, and knows the basics of special relativity will do fine with this book.  I may be &quot;picky&quot; in not giving this a five star rating, but there were some portions of chapters 6 and 7 that were hard to follow.  I should mention however, that I have been unable to find a text that does explain such material any better, while remaining accessible to undergraduates.	2000-10-14

While the questions on test day were different in  some sense from the practice questions on the CD, their underlying  structural form was an exact match.  I'm not very strong in verbal, ie. I  was struggling to get over 500, but the guessing techniques Kaplan gives  enabled me to not have to worry about scoring below 500 (verbal isn't too  important for my field but below 500 looks bad regardless).  Finally, don't  worry if you &quot;bomb&quot; the practice test the CD gives you right  away, but do worry if you study from this book and consistently  &quot;bomb&quot; the full CAT practice tests.  The reason is that I found  the final full CAT practice tests to be good predictors of how well I would  do on test day.  My actual scores were 560 Verbal, 760 Quantitative, 780  Analytical and it predicted ranges of 520 - 640 Verbal, 700 - 770  Quantitative, 760 - 800 Analytical (this was over the course of me taking  all the full CAT practice tests after reviewing their study tips).  Even  the percentage scores it gives you are good predictions for how they  correspond to scaled scores.  This is truly a sound investment, whether you  have months to study or only a single day.	2000-07-19

It has a plethora of advanced problems--the type you don't see over and over again in all the Schaum's and undergraduate texts--and the type of problems that really make you  learn something in solving them. I also havn't been bothered by annoying  typos.  <br />A warning goes out to those who have yet to master undergraduate  E&amp;M and mathematical methods in physics: this book is not for you!  At  least, not just yet.  Surely you will want to work through it once you have  gained the prerequisite knowledge, but not before then.	2000-07-16

Why is everyone complaining about the mathematical formalism in this text?  While perhaps such formalism requires a certain level of mathematical maturity on the part of the reader, it does *not* detract from pedagogy.   In my opinion, it is better to become used to such formalism in the context  of classical dynamics, where intuition can be of great help, than later on,  and please, calculus and linear algebra is all that's required!  It's not  *that* formal!<br />I'd also like to say that the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian  sections present one of the more lucid explanations that I have  seen.<br />Finally, no, the author does not give you an example problem and  then ask you to do the same problem with different numbers at the end of  the chapter--he assumes you could do that.  If you can't read a book that  doesn't have such trivial problems for you to work, perhaps you should go  elsewhere.  The problems in this book are often challenging, and require  you to extrapolate from the previous chapters.  I find such problems more  interesting than ones that require you to only look back in the chapter,  grab two equations, eliminate one variable, and then plug in numbers.  I'm  not sure why everyone has jumped on the &quot;the problems aren't worded  well&quot; bandwagon either, as I have encountered very little ambiguity  throughout this book.  If you want to master classical dynamics, this isn't  the only book you'll want to work through, but it certainly should be on  your list.	2000-07-01

I tried wordlists and many different techniques to master vocabulary words, yet for whatever reason, I found this book most helpful in enabling me to remember the words.  The short passages that you read with the words  in context in each section repeat words that you have already mastered, or  should have, and I think this method works particularly well.  Moreover,  the words that you study in this book are extremely useful for the GRE,  SAT, or just strengthening your vocabulary in general.	2000-06-06

I think this *would* have been an excellent book if it had been extensively proofread.  However, it was not, and there are typos left and right.  If a second edition comes out that fixes these typos and adds even  modestly to the content, I would HIGHLY reccomend it, but as it stands,  there are just too many mistakes.  I disagree with the reviewer who said  that Chow gets &quot;hung up&quot; on the mathematics though.  I think he  does an excellent job with the mathematics, as linear algebra and calculus  are truly the only prereqs. but he gets you thinking in a more  mathematically sophisticated manner that is essential for anyone who wants  to be able to read higher level physics/math texts.  Please Mr. Chow, make  a 2nd Edition!	2000-04-14

Gray does not intend for you to buy his book if you don't haveaccess to Mathematica and simply want to learn about differentialgeometry from an axiomatic standpoint.  Of course if you don't have access to Mathematica, this isn't for you, and even if you do have Mathematica, you will probably want to have a good &quot;standard&quot; text to go along with your learning.  Having said this, the book and Mathematica make an excellent addition to anyone's diferential geometry course.	2000-04-04

The other readers must have read this right after the Huskies won the championship--the fact that it was such an intoxicating moment for UCONN lovers must have hurt their judgement.  I for one *LOVE* UCONN, yet this  book reads like a rough draft.  Calhoun also reveals little about the  season that a devote UCONN fan wouldn't already know.  I reccomend  &quot;Huskie-Mania&quot; by Jim Shea for Huskie fans out there.	2000-02-21

The main problem I have with the book is that the author seems to be totally  unaware of who his audience is.  For example, at times the author appears  to be writing for someone who has never had a single physics/math course,  and then one paragraph later he assumes knowledge of advanced mathematical  analysis.  Case in point: he has been using vector calculus for a while and  then suddenly feels the need to explain the difference between a vector and  a scalar.  Other times it goes the other way, that is, he jumps from  talking about simple physical situations which are explained fairly well to  complicated nonlinear situations modeled by PDEs that are not derived.   Some of the equations are just given, with little explanation as to where  they come from.  For someone who has had courses dealing with fluid  mechanics and sound waves, and has a solid mathematical background, this  book is fine.  However, an undergraduate not as well versed will be  frustrated by the shift from lucid explanations to advanced material and  back again.	2000-01-30

It covers calculus of several variables, vector calculus, infinite series, fourier series, functions of complex variables, conformal mapping, PDEs, and applications.   The book is highly readable for those with a background in calculus/linear  algebra (even though there is a preface section on linear) and I believe it  would be fine for self-study.  If/when questions do pop up, there's always  #math on IRC EFNet!	2000-01-30

Putting that aside, it is a very good book on the subject and I've learned a lot from it.  The only thing I would like to see is a solutions manual, because in many chapters  three or four examples problems are worked out, and these are of great  help.	1999-11-28

I would have liked there to be a few problems that were more advanced and perhaps some more interesting applications to geometry.  It would also have been nice if  specific groups, other than the Klein-4, etc., could have been mentioned at  least.  Overall, it gives a solid axiomatic approach to abstract algebra.	1999-10-22
