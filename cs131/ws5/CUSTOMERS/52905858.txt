Mr. Surowiecki presents a very compelling argument that collective wisdom often leads to a better result than reliance upon a chosen few.  Thus, markets operate best when they are free from thousands of people work together to price goods, rather than allowing insiders to determine them. Similarly, betting lines in Vegas normally hit the mark because they are adjusted to react to the fans' betting patterns, rather than relying upon a few insiders to determine where the spread will fall.  After reading this book, I will continue to listen to the opinions of those who have specialized knowledge, but I realize that it becomes very dangerous to discount the influence of groups when making important decisions.  The book bogged down a bit in the later chapters and some of Mr. Surowiecki's conclusions appear more based on anecdotal evidence that verifiable science, but I was entertained and intrigued by almost everything he cited.	2005-01-17

Mr. Easterbrook makes a very convincing case that almost everyone is better off than their ancestors from even a generation ago. Incomes are up, most people own homes, we eat out lost, and education is available almost universally.  From his evidence, you'd think that everyone would be turning cartwheels on the front lawns of their mansions, but the opposite is true.  More and more people complain of stress, overwork and depression.  Part of that may come from the fact that we are constantly striving to keep up with our friends and neighbors as they buy more toys and bigger houses to hold them. After presenting the evidence of better societal standards, Mr. Easterbrook switches gears and proposes ways for society to cure its remaining ills, including redistribution of wealth from the wealthiest and an agenda for raising the prospects of second and third world countries.  As much as I agree with Mr. Easterbrook's ideals, he couldn't propose an agenda that would realistically accomplish them.  At the end of the book, I concluded that I was fortunate to have the abundance of wealth and health that I do, but did not walk away with any idea how to reach the societal goals that Mr. Easterbrook values.	2005-01-17

Dr. Cooper offers some very nice stories about himself and his grandfather, all of which lead to a conclusion that each of us has the ability to improve ourselves and our interactions with others through an ongoing effort to look for mutually serving solutions that are consistent with our own ideals.  While Dr. Cooper writes well and presents a very admirable premise that would help most people feel more fulfilled, I didn't find anything that has not already been covered by others and gained few insights that I could readily use to solve daily problems.  I have few major qualms with Dr. Cooper's book, but cannot wholeheartedly endorse it as an investment in productivity.	2005-01-17

Now that I have read the book, I believe that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  While Mr. Albom tells a decent story and the pace moves quickly, he falls victim to oversentimentality.  The story overall made me emphathize with the main character and  his own mistaken belief that his life was a less than valiant effort.  It did not inspire me to change how I look at the world.  Perhaps my own worldview is grounded differently from those who loved this book.  Perhaps I am more forgiving the readers who trashed Mr. Albom's efforts.  If you enjoyed \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" the odds are good that you won't consider \\"Five People\\" a waste of time, but I couldn't walk away from the book without thinking that it didn't represent Mr. Albom's best effort.	2005-01-17

Mr. Allen presents a fairly convincing argument that the best thing you can do is to scrap your \\"to-do\\" lists and adopt a system that allows you to process information on a ongoing systematic basis.  He believes that most people bog down in their efforts to reduce their burdens because they are relying too much on their memories and not enough on a system that allows them to retrieve and process information.  I've only started to put his suggestions into practice but already believe that I've become more efficient in processing the vast amount of paperwork that comes across my desk on a daily basis.  I probably will never achieve the level of mastery needed to fully capitalize upon his system, but I feel better for whatever progress I make.	2005-01-17

If most people agree that it's wrong to break marriage vows, why do so many people do it.  Another way of looking at the question is by asking why we are so obsessed with sex that it overcomes our better judgment.<br />Although I don't agree with everything in Mr. Ridley's book, it adds a dimension to the debate that I hadn't really considered, which is that almost all human behavior is driven by sexual urges and reproduction at an evolutionary level.  The behaviors that lead to successful reproduction are likely to be passed to later generations, while the only trait that cannot be passed along is abstinence.  From this model, people will engage in all kinds of seemingly irrational behavior when doing so is biologically advantageous.<br />My fundamental distress with this premise is that it diminishes the value of human reason, which is something that evolved through generations just as much as the biological drive to reproduce.  While Mr. Ridley premise is that one of the main values of being smart is that it allows the brainy people to outwit their sexual competitors, I get depressed when I think of us as essentially no more than reproductive machines.<br />Mr. Ridley writes a good story that adds some nice twists to understanding human behavior.  The writing did not move as quickly as I would have hoped, and some of the details about other species' sexual behavior dragged at times, but I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for explanations for behaviors that might not otherwise make sense.	2004-05-14

Madison is a case that every law student knows and that very few people understand.  Although modern legal discourse focuses on cases that decide social issues like racial preferences, abortion, and gay rights, none of these cases are as important as Marbury.  The reason for this is simple - - unless Justice Marshall had established that it was the exclusive province of the judiciary to determine the constitutionality of legislation, none of the important social issues would be decided in the courts.  They would be decided in the legislature or in the executive.<br />Mr. Nelson does a nice job of tracing the history that gave rise to judicial review and explaining how judicial review has become the primary place where many of our social problems are resolved.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in why 9 people in black robes may be the most powerful people in the United States, even though you rarely see them and most citizens don't know their names.	2004-05-14

Mr. Preston's book convinced me that nothing in fiction can ever be as scary as smallpox or the possibility that someone is working in a laboratory trying to weaponize it so that it can be used against a civillian population.<br />Make no mistake, although smallpox officially exists only in two freezers (one in Russia, the other at the CDC in Atlanta), Mr. Preston details the very real probability that the virus exists in many labs ranging from Korea to the Middle East.  I shudder to think that it would be possible to infect a volunteer with the virus who could then bring it to Chicago, Kansas City, Omaha, or any other city in the United States.  <br />This book served as a wake-up call for me on a threat that is far greater than anything I could have imagined.  It may be more frightening than the thought of a terrorist with a nuclear weapon.  I hope that the CIA and FBI will do just about anything to make sure that this threat is not realized.	2004-04-18

First, I majored in Philosophy in college and never quit reading it.  Second, I love the Sopranos.  So it's no great surprise that I liked this book.  What is a surprise is that I think lots of people will like this book, even if they've never had much of a desire to pursue philosophy.<br />There's a nice balance of classic philosophy (Tony Soprano as Aristotelean hero), 19th century philosophy (Sopranos as nihilism), eastern philosophy (Tony's use of Sun Tzu to guide him in the business), and modern philosophy (Carmela as feminist). Using a successful television series to demonstrate how philosophy is more than abstract throught and can be used to guide modern actions is a tremendously clever idea.  <br />If you are looking for hard-core philosophy, this is not your book.  There's no Hegelian dialectics or heavy language to digest.  Instead, this is a fun and easy way to expose yourself to philosophy or refresh yourself on many different schools of thought.  The Sopranos is a great backdrop against which the reader can explore the ethics of modern society.	2004-04-18

Once the government finds out about it, they want to pass registration acts and require deprivers to wear gloves.  Like I said, its X-Men Revisted.<br />In part two of the book, a &quot;normal&quot; who married a depriver is on a quest to find out who killed his wife.  Again, this strikes me as straight out of the Fugitive.  <br />The derivative nature of this book notwithstanding, it's not a bad read.  The pace moves quickly and some of the characters are moderately interesting.  Makes a good book to read on a plane.	2004-03-24

He is smart, pays very good attention to the nuances, and has a remarkable control over language.  In this story, Mr. Gibson has turned his attention from the near, perhaps decades away, future and focuses on the present.  Fortunately, he demonstrates the same type of observation skills to present trends that he did to potential future technologies in Neuromancer and Mona Lisa Overdrive.  <br />The sacrifice that you have to make for entering Gibson's world is a requirement that you pay attention to the details because they make his books remarkable.  I have about a 20 page limit for each session that I spend with Mr. Gibson's book because I hit information overload after that.  If you're looking for a fast, page-turner, you're probably not going to like Pattern Recognition.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a detailed book with interesting characters and a complex plot, give this a try.	2004-03-19

In Flatbellies, he told a coming of age story set around a high school golf championship.  It reminded me of Stephen King's Stand By Me as a tale that told the importance of life-long friendships as young men prepare to become adults.<br />University Boulevard picks up with several of the same characters as Flatbellies (Chipper DeHart, Peachy Waterman, Smokey Ray Divine) all entering college and pledging fraternities.  This backdrop serves as the canvas upon which Mr. Hollingworth explores important social issues of the late 1960's and early 1970's, such as the Vietnam War and racism.  He tells a decent tale about how these events played to young, privileged men during this time.<br />Once again, the greatest weakness of this book is the one-sided dimension to some of the characters, particularly the lead character, Chipper DeHart.  He's a bit too good and too conflicted about everything.  All in all, though, this was a good book.  Mr. Hollingsworth continues to show promise.	2004-03-06

So, now Mr. Kellerman has given us Jeremy Carrier, but a psychologist is not a big leap in character differentiation.  More imporantly, Dr. Carrier is not much of a character.  Not much personality, not much flavor.  I can't remember the last time I was less interested in a book's central character. If you can get past the lack of a good central character, some of the supporting cast members, such as Arthur Chess, are somewhat interesting, but none are compelling.<br />The story itself, a whodunit, with Dr. Carrier trying to determine the identify of his girlfriend's killer is decent.  There's not a lot of action, so the story is mainly cerebral.  It's not a bad way to spend a few hours, but some of Mr. Kellerman's early books are a better diversion.	2004-02-20

Good guys are normally easy to spot, notwithstanding a stereotypical flaw - whether it be wine, women, or other.  Bad guys are all cruel and calculating genuises with tortured childhoods.  Sometimes the stories are good, but the characters are the same.<br />The best thing about The Epicure's Lament is that Ms. Christesen has given us a true character with depth. He's mean, completely self-absorbed, and lazy.  He's more than happy to allow himself to rot in his parents' mansion while sucking down endless cigarettes and whiskey while planning his next mean quip. Hugo Whittier is a a true curmudgeon with few apparent redeeming values.  You want to dislike him, but you also find him compelling.  He claims that he justs wants to be left alone, but in his relationships with his brother, his paramour, and his ex-wife, I found myself wondering whether anyone can truly be an island unto himself.<br />Beyond a wonderful character portrayal, Ms. Christensen is a wonderful writer.  She has a rich and abundant vocabulary that reminded me of Nabakov in her use of arcane words to illustrate a scene or pepper a conversation.  The wordplay never distracts from the story, which moves at a good pace.	2004-02-20

He's developed a pretty good lead character in Alex Cross and used him effectively in a number of books.  Unfortunately, it seems like Mr. Patterson's bag of tricks to make Alex Cross interesting are getting thin.  He may have joined the FBI, but the change of scenery doesn't change the dynamic very much.<br />As a result, the main thing that differentiates one Patterson book from the next Patterson book is the quality of the villian that Alex Cross is determined to outwit.  Some of the villians, like the couple in &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; are good.  Others, like the vampire killers in &quot;Violets are Blue&quot; are just silly.  <br />In this case, I would give the &quot;Wolf&quot; a &quot;B.&quot;  Although the idea of a Russian mob mastermind is a new twist, Patterson has already used a kidnapping/murder theme before.  This book is O.K., but doesn't add anything particularly new or memorable to Mr. Patterson's collection.	2004-02-20

Rather than being remembered for the economic growth of his tenure of the remarkably stable foreign affairs, he will likely be remembered for Monica Lewinsky and wasting his considerable political charms.  <br />In this book Mr. Baruth posits that time travel has become a reality (but only for a select few, with government approval).  In the Year 2055, the United States is on the verge of losing a war, based upon political decisions involving litigation against cigarette manufacturers.  The lead character, Sal Hayden, Bill Clinton's biographer is chosen as part of a team to meet with Clinton and try to change his political decision.  Fascinating premise.<br />Mr. Baruth did a nice job of telling this tale.  His writing is clean and crisp.  The characters are plausible, and you can almost feel Bill Clinton aching for a second chance.	2004-02-15

Mr. Buford gives a very nice discussion of the crowd mentality and explains from a first-hand perspective how quickly a large event can turn violent.

If an employee lets you down, don't mince words and make sure that there are consequences.  Ms. Himsel also offers some good advice for structuring interactions away from the workplace and pursuing goals with higher-ups.  Using Tony Soprano as a leadership model takes a lot of guts, and it may not work for everyone, but this book gave me some laughs and some ideas.	2004-01-15

When his second book, the Foursome, hit the shelves, I eagerly anticipated it, but walked away a bit dissapointed because the focus strayed from the most interesting characters and lost a bit of steam.<br />With Scratch, McAllister has returned to firm.  Compared to the first two books, this one shifts the primary locus of the activity from the golf course to the courtroom, but Eddie Caminetti, who although fictional is a remarkable judge of human nature, comes back to the forefront.  I was pleased with both the plot development and the characters.  Most frighteningly, I fear that the conclusion (which I shall not spoil) is right on-point, which is a blow to my ego and my wallet.	2003-06-23

All are stories about a group of four teenagers who use their relationship with each other to survive the pains of growing up in the 1960;s.  Where Stand By Me was grounded upon the kids' search for a dead body and Sleepers was located in a juevenile detention facility, Flatbellies is located in a sleepy Oklahoma town and the boys are the members of the local golf team.  <br />I found that I could sympathize with the storyteller, Chipper DeHart, who cares less about his own scores than whether the team can progress to the championship.  You definitely want to see both the team and Chipper succeed, both on and off the course.<br />The only real problem that I had with the book was that some of the characters seemed a little bit too stereotypical, particulary the teen wonder, Jay Justice, who combines good looks, athletic ability, and a photographic memory into a package that is just a bit too good to be true.  If asked whether I wanted to spend a round golfing with Jay or the rebel from the other town, Smokey Ray Divine, I guess I'd have to take the later.  <br />Overall, I really liked the book and look forward to see if Hollingsworth has another story to tell.	2003-06-23

Writing Gets a &quot;B&quot;	Let me start with a disclaimer, I'm fascinated by stories that involve the Vatican and the power of the Catholic church.  As a Catholic in the United States, I'm intrigued by the vast monetary and property holdings that the church possesses worldwide, as well as the loyalty that the church has inspired.  As an institution, you know that the Catholic church has the power to survive many scandals and crises.<br />So, if the premise of the Da Vinci code is the search for information so powerful that it has the power to reduce the mighty Vatican strucutre to rubble, I'm hooked.  Mr. Brown does a nice job of framing a thriller with monks and bishops serving as the &quot;bad guys,&quot; even though they're trying to preserve a religion.<br />My only problem with this book is the &quot;gotcha&quot; factor.  I won't give away any of the secrets, but I was annoyed by the fact that every puzzle and mystery in the book was solved by the prime characters within a few pages in some form of dazzling revelation.  If the mysteries remained buried for almost two millenium, you'd think it would take more than 36 hours for the main characters to get to the bottom of them.  Mr. Brown gets an &quot;A&quot; for his idea and a &quot;B-&quot; for the execution.	2003-06-07

In just a few pages of each of his stories, Ellison creates a believeable world through the use of nimble wordplay and intriguing characters.  <br />Essential Ellison demonstrates Ellison's development over the course of his career and provides a wealth of entertaining stories.  Even more than the fiction, however, I enjoyed the autobiographical essays that are interspersed throughout the book.  Ellison opens the window to his own personality, and he is character as vivid as any of his fictional creations.  <br />The only reason that I gave four stars instead of the unabashed five star rating is because there are several stories in this 1000+ page tome that did not catch my fancy.  That's to be expected, but I struggled through about 200 pages of the overall book.  Don't let that deter you - find the stories that resonate with you.	2002-10-25

The premises that James Morrow pushes in this book - that God is ultimately responsible for the evil in the world is not new.  As Morrow explains in his book, this question has its roots in the Book of Job and has been addressed by history's greatest theologians.  What separates Morrow from his predecessors is his cataloguing of history's horrors, perpetrated on both societies and individuals.  And this catalog is very disquieting.  Ultimately, I disagree with Morrow's ultimate position, but I very much respect his writing and his penetrating attacks upon traditional theological justifications for the existence of evil in a society created by an all-knowing and all-loving God.	2001-09-30

From the lead character of Mark Whitacre to the political bickering among the various governmental entities, I was constantly amazed at the behavior of the players, which reinforces that truth is often stranger than fiction.  In the long run, I felt sorry for every single person involved in the ADM investigation and prosecution.  It seemed as though no one really won and no one really lost, except for perhaps the justice system, which takes another hit by not being able to follow through on enforcement of civil laws designed to protect competition.	2001-09-23

Because The Green was so good, I really looked forward to reading The Foursome.  Now, I'm a bit  disappointed.<br />Don't get me wrong . . . The Foursome is still a pretty  good book with an interesting premise - that people can confront their  shortcomings and make positive changes in their lives.  The problem with  the book, however, is that it focuses upon the least interesting  characters, the flawed golfers who travel to Swithen Bairn, and less upon  Eddie Caminetti.<br />Ultimately, I liked The Green better than The Foursome  because The Green allowed the reader to benefit from Eddie's wisdom after  having experienced it firsthand.  In The Foursome, the action focuses upon  Eddie's opponents and left me with the feeling that I would have enjoyed  the book more if it was told from the perspective of Eddie's teammates who  were playing against them.	2000-06-04

This historical  background information In the Heart of the Sea is helpful because it allows  the reader to better understand the culture of the industry and the reasons  why workers were placed in such appalling straits.<br />The second book that  is worth reading is The Custom of the Sea, which came out a few months ago.   The Custom of the Sea centers on a shipwreck where three survivors killed  and ate a fourth crewmember who was already dying of dehydration.  In a  breach from ordinary legal tradition, these survivors were tried for murder  and Custom of the Sea does a very nice job of presenting the societal  questions underlying the murder prosecution.  In the Heart of the Sea does  not explore these issues in the same depth, but both books are worth  reading.	2000-05-25

One can only imagine with horror being placed in the situation where you would have to kill another person to ensure that  you and others could survive, if only for a few more days.  <br />Even beyond  the story of the struggle at sea, Custom of the Sea raises important  questions about our system of criminal law.  Can the legal system justify  the intentional killing of one person where the failure to take someone's  life could mean the death of several men?  If not, does the legal system  elevate principle over substance?  On the other hand, if the law allows a  person to decide when another's life should be forfeited for the greater  good, doesn't that invite people to determine when their own needs can  justify murder, theft and dishonesty.  <br />Finally, Custom of the Sea raises  some important questions about the purpose of a penal system.  In  prosecuting the captain, what does the legal system hope to accomplish?   Certainly, he is not a threat to engage in a similar act, so deterrence is  probably not the purpose of the prosecution.  I would argue that he was  sufficiently punished for his actions by his ordeals at sea.  This would  leave the grounding for the punishment in a theory of retribution and  vindication of every victim's moral worth, but does a prosecution here  exact too much of a price?<br />Neil does a nice job of telling the story in a  narrative.  My only reservations come from the fact that some of the  details seem fictional, rather than historical, but this is still a very  fine book.	2000-05-01

Unfortunately, I hit the limits of my scientific education in high school biology.  So, I picked up this book in hopes that  it would reveal some of the mysteries of their professions and give me some  insight into the reasons why people treat often treat physicians as  magicians.  <br />Nuland's book doesn't strip away the mystique of the  surgeon's work, nor does it really capture the nature of a modern surgical  practice.  Instead, it provides an overview of many of the structures that  a surgeon encounters in his day to day work (stomach, spleen, liver, etc.)  and describes the mythology that accompanies each organ.  He also provides  tales from his own cases about where these myths have broken down and  ultimately posits that science should triumph over mythology.  <br />Nuland  tells a good story, both anecdotal and historical.  His writing is clear,  although he tends to use two words when one might do.  The organzation of  the book is clear and he does a fine job a translating medicine into  layperson's terms.	2000-03-09

From the  narrative of the book, you expect some type of fireworks when the meeting  occurs, but my reaction to this scene was &quot;Ok, what's next?&quot;  The  story raised my hopes for an interesting conclusion to the book, but it  fizzled, rather than dazzled.	2000-02-17

That Lasted 700 Pages	From the first pages of the Fountainhead, I was captivated by the struggle between Keating and Roark, not onlyas they battled as professionals, but even more importantly as they waged a less public war for their souls.   Ultimately, the important question that Rand posed to me was whether a  person can ever justify a compromise of their intellectual or artistic  integrity to achieve a purely utilitarian goal.  Rand, through Roark,  answers this question in the negative, but her characters' ultimate fates  leaves the question unresolved.  I was immediately impressed by how well  Rand developed her characters and made me care about how their lives would  progress, especially in the first half of the book when Keating and Roark  are defining themselves and their artistic visions.  <br />The book bogged  down a bit in its later stages, particularly when developing the  relationship between Roark, Dominique Francon, and Keating.  Because of its  extraordinary length and the fact that it lost some steam towards the end,  I cannot recommend it to everyone, but I can recommend it wholeheartedly to  those people who may feel disenchanted with a society that often values the  material and superficial over the enduring.	2000-02-17

Gleick does an excellent job of describing how time, and perhaps the lack  of it, has become the universal feature of modern society.  Moreover, I  believe his premise that technology has created more pressure upon its  users, rather than alleviating already existing stresses.

The book told a great story at the beginning  and I like both of the central characters, as well as the fictional device  that brought together Jones, Hagen and Judah for their match.  Pressfield's  writing during this section was clear and interesting.  Where he lost me  was in the middle stages of the book.  Although I understand that golf is a  game with overwhelming mental aspects, I found the psychological journey  through &quot;the Field&quot; somewhat disorienting and felt that the  characters lost their personalities as the book progressed.  Ultimately,  Pressfield pulls it all together for the finish, but I'd be lying if I said  that I didn't struggle through portions of the book.	2000-02-02

Through this book, Safire demonstrates that a scandal seeking function is not unique to the modern press, but was alive and well in the era  immediately following the Revolutionary War.  Almost everyone knows the  historical legacy of Hamilton, Jefferson, Monroe, Adams and Madison, but  this book reminds us that even our founding fathers were susceptible to the  weaknesses for which we condemn our current leaders.

The premise of Stern's book is - &quot;How the survivors of one of the worst disasters in coal-mining history brought suit against the coal company - and won.&quot;  <br />One of my civil procedure professors required  us to read this book before our first year of law school, because it does  an excellent job of framing the issues that a lawyer might face.  From that  standpoint, it serves as a good teaching tool.  From a social standpoint, I  also believe that the book raises valuable questions about the legal system  and whether it promotes corporates interests unless there is a firm like  Arnold &amp; Porter that is willing to step in and undertake this type of  representation.  Too often, there are attorneys who view mass disasters as  an opportunity for themselves, rather than as the tragedy that they are for  the victims.  But, on a professional level, although I think that Mr. Stern  did a good job of representing his clients, at the end of the book I  wondered whether he was as successful as he thought he was.  Certainly, his  clients were better off than they had been before his efforts, but given  the fact that his law firm earned more than $3 million from his efforts,  did his 600+ clients fare as well as he thought?	2000-01-29

Although it was not often recognized, the ideological disputes between the judicial conversatives of the Supreme Court (led by Justice  William Rehnquist)and the judicial activists (led by William Brennan)  profoundly shaped American society.
