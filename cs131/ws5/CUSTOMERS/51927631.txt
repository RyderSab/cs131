Though Epstein explains at the beginning that he is merely trying to share with the reader his own faults of snobbery, at times it comes across as his genuinely being a snob!  Though I suppose it is probably hard to be specific about, say, names you namedrop, without actually namedropping.   <br />Some of the tidbits were good, but overall the book was rather uninteresting.	2005-10-09

The psychological studies that have shown what makes people happy about decisions and events and how that happiness is affected by simple things like attitude, expectation, and comparisons to others were very thought-provoking.  I think he's got the right ideas about not keeping up with the Joneses, or even keeping up with the possible YOUs.  Too often nowadays we feel overwhelmed by all the choices we have to make that don't need to be so comprehensive to leave us satisfied with that choice. <br /> <br />I especially can appreciate his jeans buying experience, as I went into the store for some skin lotion this past winter and was dumbstruck by all the different varieties, and didn't know what to buy because they didn't have the plain yellow bottle I remember from my youth, when there were only 2 varieties. <br /> <br />	2005-09-19

While most of his other books are certainly, and in many cases obviously, influenced by his anti-war and socialistic opinions, they are usually wrapped up in a fictional story.  This book is rather simply a review of his opinions, taken to the much more bitter level of old age:  <br /> <br />\\"There is no reason to ever go to war.\\" <br />\\"Everything we do is harming the environment and it will be gone very soon.\\" <br />\\"Gas and uranium and the free market should be outlawed because they're making us all poor and dead.\\" <br /> <br />Thrown in for good measure is prose advertisement for his screen prints and possible next novel (working title:) _If God Were Alive Today_, which I would certainly buy, because it's Vonnegut, and his fiction, which I find much more enjoyable than his collections of essays that retread the same ground.	2005-09-16

McFadyen likens the spread of doctrines (and really ideas) to the spread of viruses and the coopting of DNA replication.  He shows how religious/political/scientific movements can take hold of people.  To his credit, he seems to be equally critical of all three of those subject areas.  The only real great leap he takes over meme theory, is that he sees the human as a vehicle for the spread of (what he claims is) the superior lifeform that is the doctrine/tenet; superior simply because it \\"controls us\\" and we're the dominant species. <br /> <br />Regardless, the way he shows how religion/science/politics go about convincing people their way is right, and how he shows why some people refuse to change their point of view, can be helpful for determining an approach for combating those situations.	2005-08-10

Though bits of it seem fantastical, it is mostly science fiction dealing with universe-wide quantum interactions and higher (and shared) intelligences.  The creature on the cover is really only a small tool in the telling of the story - it's life is nowhere near as interesting as the relationships of the main characters.  This is especially true of young Tess, who everyone labels as having psychological problems, but is revealed to be just as sane as everyone else.	2005-07-25

It's a full-fledged mystery, several intricate love stories, and a series of tradgedies that in the end leave you feeling good about life and literature.  Zafon does a fantastic job of illustrating the idea of history repeating itself.  His Barcelona of the 1940's and 50's seems magical and mystical, a certain specific quality you only seem to get from writers without a native English tongue.	2005-07-12

I think they are missing the worth of the book.  There is great detail within about how the government works, how policy gets determined, how defense and budget spending gets allocated, how the military is evolving over the past twenty years and will over the next twenty, how new opinions and directions can surface within the government, and just how the whole culture inside DC works. <br /> <br />Other criticisms attack parts of the book and then condemn the whole without conceding that he makes some really good fact-supported arguments for how greater connectivity to the world economy reduces the amount of conflict a country experiences.  I also really liked the parts where he answers the typical criticisms thrown at the US gov't, those of:  invading Iraq for the oil, entering the Middle East somehow as an intentional assault on Islam, sending our military overseas as empire-building, etc. <br /> <br />If anything, I think Barnett, in this book, provides an explanation of US foreign policy far clearer and more reassuring (to other nations of our intentions) than any explanation given by US leaders in the media.	2005-07-11

I view this book as the best one of the triumvirate that contains Pratchett's _Small Gods_ and the joint effort _Good Omens_.

Gaiman does it with a better written story here in _American Gods_, though still slyly humorous in many parts.	2005-07-03

He must learn about the world as it is in 2086.  That's what most of the book is about.  At least four of the chapters are him talking with whatever expert of 2086; in this Platonic manner, we get lectured on Heinlein's opinions on the faults (in his day) as he saw them in politics, religion, marriage, and the economy.  It becomes rather boring after a while, because no action is happening, no plot is really proceeding.  It started out as a decent story with his relationship with Diana, but really never got any deeper. <br /> <br />It was, however, very interesting to see Heinlein's predictions for the future.  Some were dead on, some were completely off.  I particularly liked how everyone smoked and the engineers wore asbestos uniforms.  And by 2086 we hadn't yet flown to the moon.  The Heinlein of 1939 would have been flabbergasted to learn of the internet and Google.	2005-06-22

I'm familiar enough with genetics, that going into the book, I expected a certain set of probable story plots.  However, I was very happy to find almost none of my preconceived set used.  Each story was completely different.  Some of them were surreal and some were in futuristic universes that took a good deal of imagination to put together.  Genetics wasn't necessarily the focus of each story, but rather just the foundation.	2005-06-19

Well, with the rise of cellular phone usage, a person's phone number has indeed become their ID. <br /> <br />However, the best part of the book comes in the beginning and the end, when he discusses the precise differences in what humans are good at doing versus what machines are good at doing.  He points out the disconnect between these two worlds are viewed by each, but doesn't really give any suggestions as to how to overcome the problems it creates.	2005-06-16

Part mystery, part fantasy, the novel examines the changing nature of family relationships, love interests, and karmic balance, in a modern context everyone can relate to.  You get to watch a number of characters grow (in the mental sense) and see how they all contribute to what defines the town of Unity. <br /> <br />I'm very fond of this type of novel, the kind that gets put in the \\"literature\\" section of the book store, but is just a splash of fantasy away from reality.	2005-06-04

It's organized such that the first story continues in the last story, the second story continues in the second-to-last story, etc.  They all tie together (so you want to read the chapters in order), though not very tightly.  I felt there was no grand unifying plot line to act as glue.  Any two adjacent stories were interrelated through some object or person, but that was all.  It's also less captivating at the start, as you're introduced to wildly different stories, and don't really see the connections until you reach the midpoint and start going backward in time. <br /> <br />I think Mitchell displayed a great ability to paint realistic pictures of societies in the different time frames.  It was amazing how he shifted from one style to the next, through  different narrators.	2005-05-30

Surowiecki's main hypothesis is that in many situations the answer a crowd arrives at can outperform that of the smartest individual in the group.  He gives many interesting examples of this, and of the types of situations where the group doesn't perform well and why, breaking group interactions into three types:  cognition, coordination, and cooperation. <br /> <br />Some of the topics included: the bubble booms of plank roads and bowling alleys, intelligence agencies and 9/11, restaurant tipping, television ratings, highway merging, SARS research, Linux, the Columbia explosion, corporate infrastructure, and the biggest most relevant group - democracy in the US.	2005-05-29

Almost every story is about something gone horribly wrong.  You don't see that too often, I think authors are afraid to write that kind of story, but Bradbury does it well, and has a good way to present the stories (via the illustrated man) that explains why they're morbid. <br />I think two or three were feel good stories.

They all seemed like real and complex people.  Even the characters in the story within the story. <br />The plot started out great.  I liked the concept, but it seemed like he gave up on it towards the end.  There was opportunity to make the story more surreal and interesting, and he backed off.  The story being written in the blue book was fascinating, but he dropped it halfway through and almost forgets about it.  The foreshadowing of the husband and wife relationship was perhaps too much as that whole upcoming part of the plot was obvious.  He did a better job with the friend's junkie son, but still the ending seemed disappointing in that it wasn't surprising in the least.  Hence why I wish he pursued the mystical Chang/book route more. <br /> <br />Overall though, it was still a good read, and the 230-ish pages go by quickly so you wouldn't be risking too much wasted time.  I will read other novels of Austers.	2005-03-08

Hobb built on the simpler foundation laid in the original trilogy, and made the story and the characters so much more complex and enriched.  Fitz's continual rediscovery and reinvention of himself is a great read, and many other characters are revealed in a new light as all the bits of story begin to be explained and resolved in this final book. <br /> <br />I recommend this series greatly, as well as the original Farseer Trilogy which should definitely be read first.	2005-02-09

While the transition from book one to book two was clean, books two and three are really halves of the same book.  You can't take a break between them because so much is left in the moment at the end of Golden Fool. <br /> <br />There are a few major plot lines that run through Golden Fool, however Hobb interweaves them with long wavelengths, such that one plot line is left hanging for very many chapters while another is addressed, and you being to stop caring about the other plot line, and even wondering if Hobb plans to pick it back up at all. <br /> <br />I was also disappointed at the lack of another Fitz witbond.  His Wit usage was always one of the most interesting aspects of the books, and the current disuse leaves a void in the story.	2005-01-18

The story of Fitz continues in this trilogy as he is pulled back from his secluded retirement to once again be the catalyst around which the next generation's events turn.   <br />The beginning of the book was slow (but then again, so is Fitz's life when we look back in upon him) but the intrigue picked up and I lost sleep finishing it quickly.  Just about all the characters are seen in a new light, and it was fun to see Fitz move from the role of student to mentor.  Hobb has followed up with a worthy sequel. <br /> <br />These two trilogies are very reminiscent in style of Melanie Rawn's two trilogies that also follow two generations in her world.

Again the social commentary of the book, like in Hominids, judges homo sapiens to be unenlightened, especially males.  The Neanderthal society is idealized.  An example: <br /> <br />\\"..letting women labor - funny how that word had a double meaning for females, Mary thought - in an environment free of men and their egos.\\" <br />\\"..she was beginning to think just about anything was possible - especially if there were no men around.\\" <br /> <br />The majority of this second book in the series revolves around the love relationship of Ponter (Neanderthal) and Mary (sapien), and the interesting parts about science and society are glossed over except when used to point out how inferior our sapien lives are. <br /> <br />Despite all this, I'm enjoying the series, and have hopes for the final book, Hybrids, which I just cracked open.	2004-12-23

I love Sawyer's writing in general, but he REALLY hits you over the head with social commentary.  I felt preached to in many places, and it seems his intent is to make you feel guilty for being a human, especially a male human. <br /> <br />Furthermore, I don't like how the privacy-less neanderthal society is presented as The Answer.  It's ridiculous to think there wouldn't be any corruption in the system, that they got everything right the first time. <br /> <br />The love story aspects of it are entirely not necessary for the plot in this book, and come across as being superfluous marketing.  Though he may be building for something in the sequels. <br /> <br />I've already purchased and plan to read the two sequels.  I like the concept of the parallel neanderthal world and our interactions with it and am very curious about how it plays out.  I just hope the guilt-trip gets toned down, because in general I dig Sawyer's writing.	2004-12-20

Instead, he runs with it.  The world as you've known it in the first two books becomes much more complex, and many things that previously had to be taken on word are explained.  Plot progresses at a rapid pace through most of the book, with surprises coming often, keeping it a page-turner. <br /> <br />This has been one of my favorite fantasy series, alongside Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogy and Melanie Rawn's Dragon Star/Prince trilogies.	2004-12-13

Microsoft's Cult of the Puzzle - How the World's Smartest Company Selects the Most Creative Thinkers	Books	4	3	6	N	Y	How long would it take to move Mt. Fuji? is the question.	Most of the puzzles aren't very different from stuff you find at the back of a Discover or Scientific American magazine.  The whole point, basically, is don't blurt out an answer, reason your way through the question out loud and don't assume any information pertaining to the question.   <br /> <br />I didn't find the puzzle questions or their solutions to be very interesting, except for how they make M&Ms, which I probably wouldn't have figured out.  <br />I really liked the rest of the book more - the history behind it and all the little tidbits thrown in about Gates, Microsoft culture, and interviewing in general. <br /> <br />Reading this book won't get you through a Microsoft interview with flying colors.  It will be obvious if you're regurgitating information or if you're thinking a problem through.  Chances are they're not going to ask you anything in here since it's all common knowledge now.   <br />If you've no experience working through word problems and logic puzzles, then by all means get the book to see the kind of stuff they might ask you, and what typical approaches to those types of problems can be.  But think of this merely as a mental guide and not an answerbook.	2004-08-12

The new species of man Bear creates proves to be not all that different.  There are new social interaction possibilities, and new english phrases, but they really aren't that much different.  This makes it not that interesting.

The representation of native Americans is far superior than the stereotypes put forth by the textbooks I read in school.<br />However, as much a richer source as this book is, it's not as comprehensive as a normal textbook, and essays at times seem biased.

The good guy vs. bad guy is too simplistic.  He weaves Cayce's father into the story pretty intricately... and then doesn't do anything with it, it almost seems like filler - both of her parents can be extracted from the story and it's pretty much the same.  I think they were added to justify the interest of the bad guys in Cayce.<br />In short, I wanted Gibson to dive more into the &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; ideas and groundwork and less into the cliche &quot;mafia's out to get me&quot; type of drama.	2004-04-13

It's not really a collection of knowledge on birth order and the psychological ramifications of birth order.  Instead, the book is about applying what is known about birth order to see if there is a correlation between historical figures' birth order and family variables, and their degree of revolutionary innovation, or acceptance of revolutionary innovation.<br />   Most of the historically significant scientists are covered, such as Galileo, Copernicus, and Darwin (especially Darwin, there's whole chapters on Darwin).

Moore, in many places, only presents the numbers from one side of an argument, therefore not painting a full picture.

The story is more about the relationships between the people and how they deal with the events rather than any kind of sci-fi type plot (the time travel is just a tool for plot and not the plot itself).<BR>However, there's no denouement.  The author builds all the conflict up to a grand &quot;so what happens next?&quot; spot and then just ends it, in a place that seems pretty arbitrary, as if the author himself had no idea how to wind the story down and decided it was easier to simply cut it off abruptly.  This was disappointing after a good story.	2004-03-10

However, nothing really monumental happens during these glimpses, and the story just ends at some arbitrary comment by one of the characters, leaving you wonder what her point was.  This style works when there's conflict and you're left wondering what happens next, but Robison doesn't build any.<br />However, her writing is very pleasing strictly from an aesthetic sense, she describes people and places well, and does a fairly okay job of character development, but there's not much motivation because as I said, there's no conflict or suspense or hint at plot.	2004-03-05

In this story, the protagonist accomplishes time travel via a hypnotic state where he eliminates all prejudice and preconceived notions he has about the current time and puts his mind in the frame of 1882.<br />It's a nice story with some mystery flavor, some romance flavor, though I found the ending to be less than ideal on the romantic front.

She's a little crazy, a little neurotic, sometimes trying to hard, sometimes not caring enough, but it's all pretty interesting.<BR>She actually mentions my alma mater, Wake Forest, in one of the stories, and it makes me wonder if the meeting with that student in Europe in one of the stories is based on any real life event.	2003-12-21

You can learn a lot of fascinating material from each of them.<BR>Snow Crash was written over ten years ago, but amazingly Stephenson's foresight in regards to online interaction and computer technology advancement are impressive.<BR>One of the major ideas Stephenson uses in this novel really intrigues me.  He takes relationships in computer structure and applies it to linguistics - in the early days of computer programming, it was very low level interaction, programming instructions weren't very human friendly.  Over time, we have created higher and higher level languages that allow us to program computers with language more english like and easily understandable.  His idea is that human language has progressed the same way, that there is some basic primal understanding that we all share, and that our current languages worldwide, are high level abstractions that allow us to manipulate conversations and information processing with greater ease.  Furthermore, he puts forth that the lower level human language is still accessible, much like you could still program in assembly if you wish.<BR>He gets into much more detail and extends this idea far more, but I won't share that as it's extensive and a spoiler.	2003-10-27

Thing I really enjoyed about the stories was the background information she invented to support each story; just simple few line references that enhance the story, such as when she talks of Mexican homes that always have room for guests because they're constantly being added onto since you don't have to pay property tax if the house is still being finished.  It's little things like that dropped throughout the stories that really paint the scene for you and give the characters depth.	2003-10-20

I'm not an old literature fan; I've read all the Jane Eyres and Mill and the Flosses in school, but they've never interested me as much as other genres, so I was skeptical.  It was a very good read though!  It certainly helps to have the background to recognize all the allusions Fforde makes to other works of literature, as at some parts I was clueless and had to consult friends who've read more extensively in the classics.  Fforde's style does indeed come across in some parts as a bit intellectual and haughty - but I believe that's simply because Fforde is trying to style it to fit with the era of writing this deals with.	2003-10-17

It's good to hear in her own words how the whole thing unfolded.  She says so herself, she's not some mathematical genius, she's just a smart kid that did a lot of hard work.<BR>She relates everything in the book, from the start of her early interest in math thanks to her father's frequent puzzle challenges, to her hitting on the idea of the winning project, to how she made it come to fruition.  It's a good example of how parental involvement in education, and not just sending the kids to school, can help the kids immensely.<BR>There's a good amount of instructional math in the book for those who would like to learn a little about the base knowledge she had to learn to work with cryptography.  You can also read her project paper in the back of the book.	2003-09-26

Though you might not believe in flying trees, the explanations he gives for the various evolutions and extinctions are great.  I really like the universe he has built, and the sense of overall inevitability and futility of existence you get. <BR>I actually picked up this book first, not realizing it was a sequel; so I went and bought and read the first book, but you really don't have to - Moffitt spends the majority of one of the early chapters rehashing everything that happened in the first book.  You probably could read only the second book, and then maybe go back and read the first if you want to learn more about the Nar.	2003-08-22

The concept is fresh, the characters believable.  Most of the action is planet-based, dealing with the relationships and politics of different beings and their striving to understand each other.  <BR>I don't really want to make this comparison since I hated the movie - but I saw many similarities to the end of A.I. where the aliens/robot descendants have to rely entirely upon the memory of HJO to build an understanding of the long since dead human culture.<BR>I'm off to start the sequel, Second Genesis, now.	2003-08-14

I think I don't give the book as much credit as it possibly deserves because of the overload of Earth-In-Path-Of-Asteroid stories that have been abundant the past decade or so.  Maybe if I read this before seeing Armageddon I'd have liked it more, but I agree with another reviewer - it just seemed very dry, which could be because the asteroid plot isn't new and exciting to me, and the characters can't carry the story on their own.	2003-08-11

There was just something missing that kept me from feeling like the story was wrapped up.  Maybe it was because Sears never *really* tells you the whole story, and you'll come away with two entirely different impressions of the book, dependent on whether or not you read the epilogue.<BR>And although this is booked as a kind of supernatural thriller, I didn't find it to be unbelievably so.  Some authors tend to go overboard with abduction and conspiracy theories, but I think Sears did a great job with it.	2003-07-28

After reading the cover blurb, I thought it sounded kind of hokey, but I gave it a try and I really liked it!  One review says it's like a cross between the Matrix and Catch-22.  It's not like the Matrix at all.  It's definitely like Catch-22.  The same type of humor based on incredulous story events.

However, I ended up really liking the book, especially the concepts behind the plot - the physical and social ramifications of the Chronoliths appearing, and how that effected how everything played out.  <BR>It didn't really progress as I expected either, but the way he wrapped it up was satisfying to me.  It seems more and more these days that scifi and fantasy novels are coming in series, so it was nice to discover one I could enjoy without having to follow it up with four sequels.	2003-07-13

Matt Ridley has assembled quite a collection of interesting facts and studies that have been done in regards to reproduction and evolution - and not just in regards to humans.  After saying &quot;huh.  that's interesting&quot; to myself several times in the first two chapters, I started taking notes on all the information I wanted to share with others, and by the end of the book I had several pages written down.  <BR>I highly recommend the book.

I didn't really start to enjoy this book until I was about halfway through.  Anderson starts off by introducing you to ALL the characters immediately, and there's a good number of them.  I think this is mainly because he's trying to set up a whole elaborate universe, and wants to set down all the rules and history immediately, rather than exposing you to them as it becomes necessary.  So it's a bit confusing at first.  He does start bringing their plot lines together around the midpoint, and as I mentioned, that made it more interesting and coherent.  However, I never really identified or personally cared for any of the characters.  Anderson never sold me on any of them.<BR>Also, it should be noted that this is indeed the first book of a series, and it can NOT stand on it's own.  He leaves you with cliffhangers, so expect to read the sequel(s?) also.	2003-06-15

Stephenson merely uses environmentalists to convey the story, and you don't feel like he's preaching to you at all.  The hard science keeps the story refreshing too.

He focuses mainly on the &quot;small-world&quot; principal that we're all familiar with, (i.e. the Kevin Bacon game) and shows how other successful network type application use the same model, from worm neurons to taxes.<BR>The book is extremely non-technical, and you don't need any prerequisite learning to enjoy it.	2003-05-27

Most of the stories involve a male and female as the main chars.  <BR>A handful of stories are written in 2nd person, which is extremely difficult to pull off.

The first part of it is almost like reading about MBA school; nothing much happens and you don't get real attached to the characters.  However, Eskridge pleasantly surprised me with a major plot event, which took the book to another level, and I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it.  <BR>It's not a extreme sci-fi book, and I realized at the end that one of the major currents in the book is the love relationship between two of the characters, and I think that is the real story Eskridge was trying to tell, simply using the sci-fi aspects to support it.<BR>I look forward to seeing what Eskridge produces in the future.	2003-05-19

There are still stories she can yet tell, but she's done a good job of tying up loose ends.  I'm very satisfied with how she has ended it.<BR>This novel takes place ten years after the end of Kushiel's Chosen.  Not much has happened in that time.  For the first 200-300 pages of this novel, I wasn't that happy with it.  Phedre does a LOT of traveling back and forth across the land, and Carey never delves deeply at all into any events or characters.  This is partly because Phedre never spends more than a chapter or two in one place!  Carey can't write well in that style.  However, Phedre does end up spending time in several locations and it is that majority of the book that the story is extremely interesting and Carey shines.  <BR>I definitely recommend the book and the entire series!	2003-05-14

Books	5	10	12	N	N	Hard to accept, but he may be right	The entire book is basically one giant argument:  That in order to be safe and maintain some form of privacy, we have to in fact give it up and become an open society.<BR>If we try to preserve our privacy through laws and such, he says, then we fall into the trap of who watches the watchers, because to some degree law enforcement and businesses will need access to private information.<BR>His ideal society, that he puts forth, is one where all information is available, with this caveat - that none of it open to just any priviledged group.  So, though the police may be able to see that you're standing on the corner, you can see them sitting at their desk.  While someone might know you read some newsgroup, you'll know which ones they read.<BR>He sees personal accountability, through openness, to be a great regulator of behaviour.<br />Before I read this book, if someone suggested this to me, I'd call them crazy.  But after reading his arguments, and considering the reasons why I'm an open-source software proponent, I find myself considering that Brin may be right to a degree.	2003-04-18

These authors get much more philosophical than the typical science text would, and that presents a much different perspective that's worthwhile.	2002-11-21

I feel this collection gives the best insight into KV as a person out of all his autobiographical collages (though this one isn't entirely autobiographical).  While his other collections show his history, this one gives you some insight into how he thinks and feels.  I especially liked the final piece - an interview from Playboy, he's very bitter and opinionated, yet openly vulnerable in it.	2002-11-09

Carey's world is that of Europe, physically, but not any recognizable historical Europe.  The main character is basically a glorified high class hooker with a sadomasochistic thirst, who partially graduates to playing political games.  While the story is often erotic, it isn't usually graphic.  Also, though it is a fantasy novel, there isn't too much fantastical about it.  Only one event in the whole novel really stands out as being not possible in our reality.  There are sword fights, but no dragons.  Prognosticators, but no sorcery.  All human characters.	2002-10-21

Books	2	29	62	N	Y	Book is misrepresented	The book bills Morison as a skeptic, but in the intro, he explains that he isn't a true skeptic, he was only skeptical about Jesus's rise from the dead.<br />Furthermore, Morison's entire argument is based on the acceptance of the Bible as historical fact, word for word.  If you do not also accept this as true, this book will not help you in any way.  There are no references but Biblical ones.<br />His arguments are a little weak, in that he often, OFTEN, says things like &quot;the way this passage reads, it doesn't sound like a made up story, it sounds like an historical account would read, so it must be true!&quot;  Which is a totally bogus argument.  He often states his opinion as fact and draws &quot;logical conclusions&quot; that do not follow any defined rules of logic.<br />Despite all this, there were two or three very good points in this book that have certainly made me reconsider some of my opinions on specific items, so it has proved to be a little bit valuable to me, though you might not get anything out of it.	2002-09-17

I was fond of the relationship the main character had with &quot;Number 2&quot;, and I think that saved the whole book from being simply a documentary about a woman who can't make up her mind about men.<BR>It's a quick read, being only 250 pages, which makes it worth reading if you're curious about Nova's work, or have a lazy rainy afternoon.	2002-07-10

First, I felt it was overloaded with \\"case studies\\", where she tells you stories of bullies/victims and girls turning on each other.  It was like mini soap operas.  I found it tedious, though I'm sure many people will appreciate those parts because they can identify with them, validating their own experiences.<BR>Secondly, the book paints a very nasty picture of girls - as conniving, manipulative, petty, vindictive witches.  Backstabbers that won't hesitate to cut down a friend for mere popularity or social acceptance.  (Interestingly, she lauds males as being simple, honest, straight-forward, forgiving, and loyal).  She also hypothesizes on how girls in various roles (victim, bullier, deserter) fare later in life in business and social situations.  I found these parts intriguing.<BR>I feel the most valuable part of the book is the last chapter and the conclusion, where she gives advice on how to deal with this kind of situation, and how to avoid the situation, from the perspectives of girl, mother, and teacher.  I think this could be very helpful for those despairing of \\"alternative aggression\\" circumstances.	2002-07-08

This book reads like it was put to print when it became &quot;good enough&quot;.  The foreshadowing is blatant, the plot mechanisms are cliche.  He even makes a huge obvious mistake - the characters are using earpieces to communicate, which also translate language into common-era English on the fly; the thing is, for a good portion of the second half of the book, the characters have turned off all their earpieces, but can STILL understand what the locals are saying, when just 12 hours ago, they could understand nothing without the earpieces!  There are other smaller time inconsistancies.  This is just sloppy, and I think a lot of popular authors let their quality drop like this when they're pumping out a book or more a year.<BR>Despite all of this, the book was still enjoyable, and that's what saved its rating.

Gilbert has a way of creating a very vivid scene and situation, so as to wrap your interest around the characters promptly.

Instead of focusing on particular people and events and dates, the author takes a look at civilization as a whole.  He argues that certain peoples have achieved greatness or modernity in certain places, not due to anything inherent in those people, but rather due to the environment in which they lived; things such as land mass axis orientation and size, native food and laboring animals available for domestication.

I don't know if OSC had his FTL explanation all worked out beforehand, but it just seems like it's something he solidified at the last minute to help his plots reach some culmination.  Furthermore, he ruined Novinha as a character.  Her paradigm shift, and personality shift at the end of the book is unreasonable.  Likewise, Qing-jao's spiral into narrowmindedness.  OSC doesn't give enough justification for either.  Also, there was so much potential with Plikt, and I thought for sure she's play heavily into the novel, but she remained a background character at best the entire time.  What a waste.

The book shows itself to be highly subjective from the opening little story whose moral is: &quot;Should have got an internship at Microsoft!&quot; A lot of what they say in here about making developers' office space as comfortable and homelike as the developer pleases is definitely a good idea and this portion of the book I like. However, there are portions that advocate practises that I deem detrimental. For one, success is the only measure for respect or advancement in the organization, which only serves to turn the employees into workaholics fearful of falling behind their fellow man. This sort of atmosphere leaves no place for family men and women who would like a steady 40-50 hour work week where they know they'll have the weekends off to spend with their kids. But, this book suggests that Microsoft doesn't want those people, because it's bad for business. The problem is, not every company is so prestigious, has so many developers submitting resumes that they can be as selective as Microsoft. It's unreasonable, especially for companies located in an area that is not inundated with tech talent. Another bad point is how it says Microsoft's strategy is to push the envelope and do what other companies don't have the guts to do; such as be monopolistic, be immoral, engage in practises against the anti-trust laws. The book suggests Microsoft gets ahead by be more daring and doing what other companies won't because they are afraid of repurcussions. The problem is, many companies cannot disregard many of these things. Surely a company that is in a healthcare industry, or maybe has board members with opposing opinion, can't take these steps. Though, I agree it has worked well for Microsoft, where it all comes down to Bill. The basic thing I'm trying to convey is, though there are some sound ideas in the book, you really need to see if they fit in with what your company does, at what stage of life it's in, what is currently working or not working.  This is not a Bible or magic bullet.	2001-08-26

I'd say it peaked around 3/4 through, and then the rest was really just filler, and not all too interesting.  One thing I really like about KV, is his characters keep reappearing in various novels of his.  A handful show up in here.	2001-08-10

And though very enjoyable, I figured out what was nagging me the entire time I read it - Player Piano is an extrapolated retelling of the plot of Fritz Lang's classic silent movie Metropolis (1926).  Nonetheless, Vonnegut took the 115 minute silent movie, which would probably translate into a 40 page book, and wrote in detail and additional subplots to fill out an additional 300 pages that are well worth reading.	2001-08-07

To further make it uninteresting, he repeatedly tells you what's going to happen looong before it does, which leaves you with &quot;well it's about time that happened.  no big surprise.&quot;  The characters never get fully developed either, which leaves you not really caring what happens to them.  This is the lowest rating I've ever given Vonnegut.	2001-07-28

It talks of Buddha himself, the different flavors and divisions of Buddhism, Buddhism as it exists in different countries, Buddhist practices and ceremonies, and a basic introduction to beliefs centered around the precepts Buddhist monks follow.  Again, it doesn't go too deeply into beliefs, and really only gives a few passages from notable belief texts. What other reviewers say about the FWBO is true, indeed the whole of the last 5 pages or so is a complete sales pitch on the organization.  However, it certainly didn't pervade the book or cloud the information being presented.	2001-07-26

The whole first half of the book is spent pointing out things like two neanderthals working together proved better than two neanderthals in competition.  No kidding.  I think it's obvious that every situation involving two entities doesn't have to end with a &quot;winner&quot; and a &quot;loser&quot;.  Finally in the second half of the book, he gets into concepts that may be new to some people, such as the idea of memes and cultural evolution.  However, there are much better books out there on these topics, since they are only touched upon here for fifty pages or so. I also know why &quot;Bill Clinton called the book astonishing and fascinating and instructed White House staff members to read it.&quot; It's because at the end of the first part, Wright discusses how society might choose to concede many personal liberties in order to feel generally safe, and that this won't necessarily bring about 1984.

It's really hard to find good one-book fantasy, in my opinion, but Dragon Weather is certainly one of my favorites.  I could hardly put it down.  I really enjoyed Watt-Evans's style, and only fault him on one count - in the beginning portion of the book, he really hits you over the head with his foreshadowing, and I worried the suspense wouldn't hold my attention, but boy, did it!  I was nearing the end and saw no possible good way for this book to end without several sequels, but then he ties it all amazingly!  Very satisfying, it was!    Update:  Two sequels have since been produced, which are very good also.  This book can still stand very well on its own.	2001-07-08

It was written in the early 90's, and the author deals mainly with a handful of programming languages, only one of which people really use nowadays.  Furthermore, much of the information is very basic.  There is definite value in reading this book if you're a new college grad, and have no industry experience; there are lots of common sense coding practices detailed that people generally pick up on the job.  However, for those with industry experience, especially those who have worked on a released product, the entirety of this book will old hat, save for chapter 31-Personal Character, which I think is deserving of a read by everyone - but just spend 10 minutes with it in a bookstore.	2001-07-08

Though I typically find KV's books very entertaining, this one just didn't do much for me for the first 9/10 of it. Vonnegut usually has some phrase or idea he repeats extensively in his novels; you may remember \\"ting-a-ling\\" or \\"So it goes\\"; well, in this novel, which is excessively badly pornographic in passing, Vonnegut feels the need to tell you the size of every male character's member upon introduction; It really doesn't serve any central purpose to the story. <BR>Two of the key characters, Rabo and Kilgore, are served up much more fascinatingly and entertainingly in other books. He also includes a TON of drawings, which are only necessary maybe one fifth of the time. I guess I believe he has a problem with moderation!	2001-06-23

I picked up this book for the history-of-marriage value instead of the same-sex-marriage-propaganda value, and found the history and debated &quot;reasons why people have historically married&quot; to be rather uninformative.  A lot of what was said seemed common knowledge about basic history of society.  Marriage concepts are talked about generally more often than not.  I would have liked to see more hard core facts rather than musings and contemplations.  I was hoping for statistics to be sprinkled liberally, and perhaps many tales of certain marriages in the past that stood out either as especially abnormal for a time period, or exceedingly typical.	2001-06-23

Garfinkle spends upwards of 60 pages or so just introducing to you the concepts of this new world.  Though he does finally get around to inserting plot into the story, it only really works for the middle portion of the book.  The big huge problem that is faced by the creatures of this world is encountered with a third of the book left to go, and it is entirely too obvious that the resolution to this problem is the climax to his novel.  It also was obvious how the story would most likely end, and as such, it was very unsatisfying at the end.  This book is an interesting curiosity, but I wouldn't call it a great read.	2001-06-13

Elder broaches many taboo topics to point out where America has forgotten common sense and decency.  He spells out why many problems have not gotten resolved, and why, unless things change, they'll only persist or get worse.  Everything is backed up by references; it's not just him spouting off his opinion.  Though I have long noticed the double standard given when certain types of news stories are reported, I never knew the media was predominantly liberal!  I never knew of Malcolm X's change of heart.

It takes a while for things to get started, and even then they never get on a roll.  I never had the desire to find out what was going to happen to the protagonist next.  I couldn't empathize with him.  I found it easy to put this down at night instead of choosing reading over sleep, as it has been with his other books.	2001-04-28

Man, if any of his books really reflects his views on war, government, and patriotism, this one leads the pack.  He lays the satire on pretty thick.  Unlike _Bluebeard_, he handles the fictional biography idea well.  The book is structured very nicely.  Like _Bluebeard_ though, he provides one of the more satisfying conclusions to his story.

You're given a very undetailed biography of Galileo's later years (mainly).  They don't really go too much into his research, discoveries, inventions.  But what I've come away with as the most beneficial part of the book is how you get an inside view into the culture of that era.  Since the actual letters from Suor Maria Celeste to Galileo are reproduced, you get to see what sort of things they had to deal with on a day to day basis.  You get to see the politics of church and state that Galileo had to play most of his life.	2001-04-19

His style for this one is supposed to be an older gentleman writing an autobiography, but KV waltzes off that track fairly early, and you lose that feel.

I absolutely loved his collection _Quicker_than_the_Eye_, but _Golden_Apples_ has an entirely different feel to it.  All the stories have this nostalgic airy utopic tone that makes all the characters unbelievable.  It's almost victorian.

I picked up this book to feed that and give me more ammo to discuss why I didn't like him.  What has actually happened is I gained some amount of respect for him as a politician.  He may look like a smiling monkey, but he does know politics, and he does know how to get things done; granted, that may be via the good ole boy (or should I say grand ole party) network.  Yes, Daddy's money and name have bailed him out more than once, but did you know that he was a mastermind behind Bush's '88 run for office?
