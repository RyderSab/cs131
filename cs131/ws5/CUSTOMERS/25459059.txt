To many times that human touch can get lost in cold academics. This isn't to say that Mr.Barker doesn't know his stuff. I especially liked DEAR THEOLOGIAN in chapter 19. This is a letter written by God that deals with some thorny issues in morality. On page 126 Mr. Barker deals with the fact that our Constitution is a secualr \\"godless\\" document. I always find it funny when people tell me that this country was founded on christian values. Well, if they mean \\"christian values\\" such as conquering and enslaving people and forcing them to give-up their faith and adopting your own while building your agricultural empire, then I guess there could be some truth to that. But as for founding a country based on the principles of liberty and freedom for all, they would be wrong. Only by keeping this country a secular democracy can everyone be free to worship, or not to worship how they please. There was a reason why it was called \\"the dark ages\\"; when church and state ruled together. <br /> <br /> How anyone can read about a god murdering innocent children, infants and unborn babies in a flood to satisfy his own vanity is beyond my comprehension. How someone could ignore a god commanding that children are to be dashed agaisnt rocks and pregnant women to be ripped up (HOSEA 13:16); just goes to show how desensitized religion can make a person. But we must see religion for what it truly is. Mythology.  <br /> <br />The only problems I had with this book was that I would have liked for Mr. Barker to have had even more stories about his deconversion and let us see even more of that human side. <br /> <br />The other problem was his songs. I hate to say it but I could have done without them. Sorry Dan. I'm sure you're a great singer/song writer and all but I just skipped over them. <br /> <br />	2005-08-08
US	25459059	R1L7D38HMKYWTT	038551316X	86124043	The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ	Books	1	22	64	N	N	LATTERDAY FICTION	When I started reading the BOM I did alittle research about Joseph Smith on the side. His life as a reputable prophet soon became suspect. However I will leave you the reader to find that out for yourself since I'm not interested in \\"second hand information\\". <br /> <br />What I found while reading the BOM was very poor archeological evidence, racist attitudes concerning those with dark skin, and a continuation of myths taken from the King James Version. <br /> <br />I love to go arrowhead hunting. In my collection I have an arrowhead named the Greeneville Point. It is dated at 1500 to 3000 years old. My point here is that if I, an amateur in the field can find such a tiny find, why have'nt the thousands of professionals over the centuries found the swords, breastplates, chariots, temples and cities disscribed in Mr. Smith's book? We are told in the BOM that literally millions died in numerous wars, but there is just no evidence. Of course Mr. Smith , to his credit, does tell of a few instances where God covers these sites with mountains and sinks some into the sea. However this is not done in everycase which would still leave us with a wealth of evidence. But alas there is none. <br /> <br />Slavery was a hot issue in Joseph Smith's time. To the Mormon's credit they were anti-slavery. But people of color, both in Christianity and in Mormonism, were seen to be \\"filthy and loathsome\\" people. Wheather we are talking about the curse of Ham, or the curse of the Lamanites, judging a person's worth by the color of their skin is inexcusable. <br /> <br />Then there is the everpresent mythological creatures. Mr. Smith, who is supposedly inspired by divine forces of truth is'nt told to correct these errors which he borrows from the King James Version. We are told of three such creatures. The satyrs, the dragon, and the mischievous cockatrice. (2NEPHI 21:8 and 2NEPHI 23:21-22) <br />SATYRS: Part man part goat this greek myth is more well known as Pan. <br />DRAGON: This one needs little defining. Although some translatters may see this as representing a crocadile, or even Satan himself. The important note here is that Mr. Smith fails to clear-up the confusion, but simply passes it on. <br />COCKATRICE:Part chicken, part snake, this creature could kill you with a glance. <br /> <br />Mr.Smith knew he was'nt the best author in the world so he covers his bases by stating imperfection in the text(MORMON 8:12,17 and latter in chapter 9:31-33). So we have to ask ourselves if GOD wanted his word to be accurate and uncorrupted why not write it himself and just let Mr.Smith find it in that form. Perfect, without mistranslation and not in Old English? <br /> <br />Then there is God destroying whole communities because of the sins of unbelievers. I guess God does'nt have a problem with \\"collateral damage\\". (2NEPHI 23:16,18/HELAMAN 11:4-6,15:2-3) <br /> <br />In my studies I've come to the truth that all religions are based on mythology. I have no doubt that in the future Mr. Smith's book earn him a footnote among the rest. The late Mr. Joseph Campbell once wrote that if you study other peoples religions and mythologies you will get a better sense of mythos in your own religion. As an ex-christian for over 20 years my studies have led me to agree with Mr. Campbell. But as I've stated before in my reviews, don't take my word for it. Read the Book of Mormon, study it throughly and make-up your own mind. <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-06-26

At 48 years of age with over 25+ years of intense research and introspection I am still more convinced than ever that the King James Bible represents the worst in mankind's imagination, and has been responsible for more crimes against humanity than can be counted. It's up to the reader to decide how much time and effort they want to put into this complex and controversial book. I could list many reasons why not to take this book as anything but a literary work of fiction but that would be setting-up my views to the narrow minded bigots and not convince those who don't want to deal with the bible with an open mind.

Keeping track of the \\"players\\" may be somewhat taxing, but it is well worth the struggle. Christians might be surprised to know how much political manuvering and religious violence went into the development of their sacred text. The only thing that bothered was Rubenstein's scant mentioning of Hypatia, the neo-platonic philosopher, mathematician, teacher, and astrologer, who was killed by a rioting christian mob, who stripped her naked and cut her into pieces.

It teaches what all religions teach, a sense of self-loathing and fear of punishment. It teaches contempt for women, hatred for other beliefes and lifestyles, disgust for those that would seek answers through science, reason and logic. Like Christianity it's past is filled with unethical idealologies such as slavery, murder, ethnic cleansing, rape and torture. Also there is the blatant errors of ancient cosmology which are proof in themselves that this and other religions are anything but divinely inspired. So, do I have contempt for religion? Yes. Do I have contempt for the people who practice it? No. I wish more people would study not only their religion but other beliefs as well. I've gone through many emotions in my years researching religion. Many different feelings have come to mind while reading sacred books. But you know one emotion that I've have yet to experience. Laughter. Yep, you heard me right. When is the last time you ever read a holy book and burst out laughing? Think about it. As for Mr. Dawood this review is no reflection on him or his translation.<br /><br />I encourage everyone to read the Koran and draw your own conclusions based on logic, reason and human compassion and not on fear or coercion.	2004-08-15

The word Creator comes first in the title yet 99% of the book is about how complex the universe is. Yes, I got that the first hundred pages Mr. Ross. He states right at the begining that this creator of the cosmos is the Christian God and that it's bible is the ONLY source for truth and accuracy concerning the universe. Ross quotes a little scripture to try to win us over to his beliefs and then quickly pours on the science to draw us away from some questions concering how reliable the bible really is in it's views of God and the cosmos. What it does'nt answer is a few theological questions that I would like to pose.   1. Why would a perfect being who is self-sufficient feel the need or desire to create in the first place? Need and desire come from a lack of fullfillment. These are human qualities.  2. How can perfection create imperfection, let alone concieve it?  3. Why would a God need to be believed-in so badly that He would threaten to torture his creatures for all eternity?     Mr. Ross seems to exclude some of the bible's errors in it's view of the earth and cosmos. Some of these are as follows.  1. Dan. 4:10-ll talks of a tree that is visible to the ends of the whole earth. This is not possible since the earth is sphere shaped.  2. Isa. 40:18-23 says that God sits upon the circle of the earth. Here the word circle comes from the hebrew \\"chuwg\\" which means compass like.  3.In Jos.10:12-13 the sun is commanded to stand still, but as we know , the earth is the one moving around the sun.  4. In Rev. 6:13 and Mar.13:25 all the stars of heaven are to fall to earth. Trillions and trillions as Mr. Ross might say. Well I don't have to tell the reader what would happen to the earth if this happend.  I expected to read a book that would be fair and balanced. But that was'nt the case. If I should read another one of Ross's books I'm sure it will be from the libary since I intend not to to spend my good hard earned money.   To use some of Mr. Ross's mathmatics the chance of that happening is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 to 1.	2003-12-18
