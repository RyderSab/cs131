Weiss' Lucky Wander Boy. For instance, it requires someone with a decent knowledge of, and appreciation for, the classic video games referenced, such as Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, etc. Also, it requires someone with more than a passing interest in (or at least a high tolerance for) existential/metaphysical philosophy such as people might indulge in after taking hallucinogenic drugs. Fortunately, I happen to fall right in the requisite audience: I love both video games, and highly abstract thought/philosophy, and so I had myself quite a good time. <br /> <br />Maybe you would, too. <br /> <br />And then, maybe you wouldn't. <br /> <br />There is certainly a lot of potential, here, as this first time author succesfully plays with convention, writing in novel, screen and stage writing formats, not to mention the thread of the entries to a \\"Catalogue of Obsolete Entertainments\\" that are always somehow relevant to the larger, surrounding narrative. The ending, without saying too much, is interesting and daring. I am still not certain that it is entirely successful, but it is at least thought-provoking, and that's saying something, right? <br /> <br />In short, the author tells a fine story with an engaging plot and decent characters, and manages to do this while being playful and inventive in his presentation. The philosophy discussed in the piece--the philosophy of video games--is well-done, even if it's obvious that it isn't ever meant to be taken seriously. It leads to a hard question of whether anything in the book is to be taken seriously at all, and I don't have an answer to that, either. The author references Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter (and it has an obvious influence) and it reminds me more of that work in that it seems to delight simply in being clever, rather than the (very serious and purposeful) Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud, also referenced. So: does the author really believe that there is philosophical insight to be gained in studying video games? Or, are we just to feel the main character foolish, and a loser, for believing so? <br /> <br />The ending may answer that question for you. <br /> <br />And then, maybe it won't.	2005-09-26

I even understand why this review will be voted unhelpful by so many. I didn't want it to end this way, either. I didn't \\"like\\" it, either. <br /> <br />I mean, the way that I kept hoping it would end involved Roland encountering Gan (in some fashion) at the top of the tower, and being led to the clearing at the end of the path to be greeted by Cuthbert, Alain, Cort, Sheemie and Susan. I wanted some indication, at last, that Gilead had once again risen. Yes--that would have made me very happy, and not disturbed me like this ending did. <br /> <br />But then, I got to thinking... <br /> <br />Did Roland deserve a happy ending? The following quote is from someone else's review, currently one of Amazon's \\"Spotlight Reviews\\":  <br /> <br />\\"However in this case with the help of Ted Brautigan the universe is saved early on and 2/3's of the book is a slow denoument as Roland continues on his quest to see the Dark Tower even though it no longer matters.\\" <br /> <br />God, I mean, I *love* Roland... but his quest was never to save the universe. It was to ascend the Dark Tower. And for that quest... for that hollow, selfish quest, he had abandoned everything and everyone around him. He killed. He murdered. He let Jake fall. Not to save the universe, my friends, but to ascend the Dark Tower. King doesn't hide it, either, nor ever hide the fact that Roland carries death with him. Smells of death. <br /> <br />When, at the very end, King gripes at those who only care about the end and not about the journey... he's *not* griping at the reader (or, he is, but only secondarily). He's griping at Roland. Roland could have settled with his ka-tet in the Callas, and lived what life he could. He could have stopped in the field of roses, stopped at some point before losing everyone and everything, but Roland was so very single-minded (as we're told time and again) that he could only truly see the value of things in terms of whether they led him to the Dark Tower. <br /><br />Roland's fate is very grim. He cares only for fulfilling his quest, and of course, when he finally enters the Tower itself, the roses stop singing--what would Roland *be* without the quest? Roland is defined by his quest. Roland, and people like him, when they've accomplished what they've striven for *don't stop*. They don't savor, either. Instead, they immediately head out for a new Dark Tower, imagining that this new one will be the one they've looked for the entire time. <br /> <br />Roland *starts* in the Dark Tower. It's always been true symbolically, and now we know it's true literally, too. His real redemption will come about when he stops his endless journey, because there can be no fruit in an endless journey. The only real reward can come when he stops and enjoys the things (and the people) he has. When he stops to, er, smell the roses, and preferably before he lets Jake fall. And, as bleak as this ending is, we should know that the horn exists to let us know that... there is still hope for Roland. <br /> <br />Now, that said, there are some genuine disappointments I had with the novel that I don't think are redeemed by their symbolic/poetic significance. First and foremost is Walter/Flagg's throwaway demise. It needed to be more than that. Instead, Walter was used to impress upon us Mordred's unique strength which was never fully used either. Mordred himself, succumbing as he did to a bad case of the runs and Oy's alertness, seemed unsatisfying. I didn't much care for Danville's ability--too unwieldy--and a bit too much like deus ex machina for me. (And why didn't Susannah request some drawn-on legs, while they were at it? Hell, why didn't Dandelo put it to use? Or the Crimson King? [Don't tell me that spry bugger couldn't detect *that* kind of power]) There was also just a bit too much on developing new, tertiary characters, for my taste. Even though I actually kind of came to like, say, Finli O'Tego, did I really need to know what the guy/weasel was like? I suppose it helps somewhat to accept Eddie's death, that his assassin had something of a character, but not enjoy to justify making the novel that much longer, in my opinion. There were a lot of Finlis--characters that we got to know in too great a detail for their role in the overall structure. Finally, I have to admit that Susannah's happy ending just doesn't sit well at all. Yes, they are *an* Eddie and Jake, but they aren't *the* Eddie and Jake, and therein lies all the difference in the world. The thing about people is that they're irreplacable. <br /> <br />There were also some huge positives for this novel. Callahan's redemption in the beginning was marvelous. The artwork throughout (because bringing up Callahan calls to mind that glorious picture) is wonderful, capturing just the right moments in wildly attractive colors. The raid on Blue Heaven is excellent. The trek through Empathica is gripping, as is the diversion on Odd('s) Lane. Stuttering Bill (no, the other one) was nice to see, and Roland's trip up to and through the tower was well-written, too. King, of course, is a masterful writer, and so even the \\"slow parts\\" are enjoyable to read. Oh, and, by-the-by, I don't think his involving himself as a character was inappropriate or poorly done at all. I thought it was clever, entertaining and appropriate to the overall philosophy of the piece. The never-answered question of who was drawing whom will entertain my thoughts likely forever. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great book in a masterwork series. It would be unfairly insulting to King, who is far deeper than his critics give him credit for, to say that \\"it isn't typical King because it's 'deep'\\" but it's also true that there is a philosophy running through these works that isn't readily apparent in his other novels. If some of his sense of plot is lost in service to bringing these philosophical overtones to their appropriate conclusion, only reflect that Mr. King's great weakness (which Ithink he'd admit) has always been endings. And actually, when properly understood and reflected upon, I think we'll find that Roland's ending is one of the best King has ever written. Even if we don't \\"like\\" it.	2005-09-23

It is hard for me to evaluate Charles Dickens.<br /><br />On the one hand, he is a brilliant satirist. His evaluations of \\"self-made men,\\" capitalist theory and empiricism in Hard Times, A Christmas Carol and others are magnificent. His ability to put together a plot, and have it develop into a thrilling finale, like in A Tale of Two Cities, is masterful. His command of the language is top-of-the-line.<br /><br />On the other hand, sometimes Dickens' pacing can feel a little slow, especially in his exposition. The first half of a Dickens novel can be a tough road to hoe, even though the ending is ultimately worth it. Sometimes his plots--in order to have that wonderful conclusion he's known for--are too contrived to be believed. Sometimes his desire to point out social ills outstrips his desire to tell the best story possible.<br /><br />Oliver Twist is a perfectly representative Dickens novel, capturing both the master's strenghts and weaknesses.<br /><br />The satire in Twist is great, showing us the hypocrisy prevalent in the officials running state charities who want to take care of poor people, not to help the poor, but to secure payouts for themselves. The ending of Twist is dynamic, as the thieves and murderers finally get their comeuppance. The writing throughout is engaging and warm.<br /><br />Also, Twist sometimes drags. It drags in the beginning, and throughout, whenever Dickens feels compelled to give us background on the situation. Usually, he's introducing more background in order to pull off all of the coincidences that he needs at the ending. Oliver Twist's ending is very, very contrived.<br /><br />Another feature common to Dickens is having wonderful characters. Twist is archetypal Dickens here, too: Fagin (especially), the Dodger, Master Bates (don't blame me--that's the way it is in the novel!), Sikes, Grimwig, Nancy and others are dynamic and memorable. In fact, my main complaint character-wise is that, compared to all of these interesting characters, Oliver Twist himself gets a little lost; he sort-of goes from situation to situation, observing but not really acting.<br /><br />Oliver Twist, like its author, has its ups and downs. It is certainly worth reading for its merits, but the impatient reader will take warning of its faults--if you're the type who's apt to give up during slow bits, you might not quite make it.<br /><br />Fully three stars.resting characters, Oliver Twist himself gets a little lost; he sort-of goes from situation to situation, observing but not really acting. <br /> <br />Oliver Twist, like its author, has its ups and downs.

US	44880576	R1TSRNJP9NO8BO	0743251628	446733041	5: The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Hile, stranger--we are well met in the Calla.	Stephen King is a masterful storyteller, and his magnum opus continues in this volume in fine, if not quite perfect, form. <br /> <br />Wolves of the Calla, more than any other volume thus far in the Dark Tower series, stands on its own. It is a fantastical recreation of the villagers-enlist-heroes-against-raiders story most famously captured in The Magnificient Seven, The Seven Samurai and !The Three Amigos! In this volume, we get some reward for all of the harrowing adventures endured in the first four novels, seeing our beloved ka-tet in perfect fighting form, seeing them for the Gunslingers that they are. The overall feel is something like a rest and recovery between the high-tension behind us and the high-tension that is certainly ahead. <br /> <br />This provides, perhaps, the one real complaint that a reader could have: Wolves is a little slow-going, and especially at first. Readers used to the rip-roaring pace of the first few books might be put off by the Calla-esque sleepiness of the first three quarters of this one, as we get palaver, more palaver and more palaver still. Palaver fans will rejoice. <br /> <br />Really, I believe that Wolves allows us to see something that the other novels haven't--Gunslinging in standard operating procedure. As such, it is an important and enjoyable part of the narrative. The overarching story, however, isn't much advanced until the very end which culminates in a series of important and exciting revelations. <br /> <br />Of five, I give four stars. A fun Stephen King story and a prelude to the endgame of the Dark Tower series, which should be a barn-burner. Not quite the intensity of The Waste Lands or Wizard and Glass, but by no means bad or disappointing. A solidly good novel.	2005-09-10

It was a slow-paced (but enjoyable) story set in a sleepy, bucolic village. Well, that's done. This story begins with a \\"beamquake\\" and the ground keeps right on shaking from there, separating our ka-tet into the two missions that were set up before: finding Susannah-Mia (and her chap) and sealing the deal with Calvin Tower. Neither mission will go easily.... and then.... there's the big twist at the end. <br /> <br />Yes, this is something like The Neverending Story... but it's much more than that, too. The Neverending Story was a cute, and extremely well-executed, gimmick concept that made for a wonderful children's book. King is here presenting an entire theory of literature, itself. The mythology in The Dark Tower (and by extension, his body of work), revolves around answering the question: \\"Where do you get these ideas!?\\" And providing a compelling, original answer for that question. The interplay between mid-world and \\"reality\\" is interesting and insightful, and we still don't really know which is leading what. Also to mention is the clever frame of the song, stanza by stanza, giving a deliberate form to King's work that we rarely see (13 stanzas, the last one ending in section 19, of course).  <br /> <br />Well, childe Roland to the Dark Tower is just about to come... and I can't wait. Is it turtles all the way down? What *is* in the room at the top of the Dark Tower (is it empty? O Discordia)? Will our heroes survive (it looks grimmer and grimmer)? Will Roland finally face down Walter? Will the Tower fall? <br /> <br />One book to answer all of these questions, if you hear me. And it does me fine.	2005-09-10

Wow. <br /> <br />Take a deep breath before plunging into James Ellroy's The Black Dahlia--this novel is breathtaking and brutal. <br /> <br />The novel concerns a famous 40's murder in Hollywood that to this day goes unsolved. It centers around a cop who winds up as an unofficial detective on the case, which eventually consumes his life, in aspects both professional and personal. The 40's atmosphere is perfectly captured, being narrated in the classic hard-boiled noir detective voice, and set against a historical backdrop (the 'land' in the Hollywoodland sign is being taken down near the finale). <br /> <br />The plot is filled with twists and turns, while the characterization remains smooth and consistent. Technically, it's simply marvelous. If there is anything that might turn you away from this novel, it would probably be that the overall tone and themes of the book run from bleak to bleaker. Much like in the author's L.A. Confidential, corruption and deception abound in Ellroy's Los Angeles, and any time you trust anyone for anything, you're playing the fool. I personally didn't mind the dark perspective, if for no other reason than its being executed so flawlessly and so poignantly. (At one point, while showing the awfulness of the torture and murder of this young girl, who had hoped to be a starlet, Ellroy has a high school band playing \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\" and \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" in the background. Ouch.) <br /> <br />All in all, highly recommended, if you can stomach the dark and seedy underside of glitzy Hollywood being portrayed with the ruthlessness of a proton microscope. If you can stand the dark, this is a novel to read and enjoy. Well done, Mr. Ellroy!	2005-08-26
US	44880576	R2RZXBJ73G2GWX	0786817070	442293804	Artemis Fowl (Artemis Fowl, Book 1)	Books	1	28	44	N	N	Fowl is Foul	Harry Potter fans should rejoice at Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl: it proves, beyond shadow of doubt, the hard-to-imitate talent of J.K. Rowling. <br /> <br />Artemis Fowl fails on almost every level imaginable. The characters are (intentionally) unlikable, and most of them are even uninteresting and forgetable. Certainly, the title character is somewhat interesting, but stunningly we spend very little time with Fowl and his schemes. Most of our time is spent watching fairy bureaucrats play office politics. <br /> <br />The writing is abysmal, wordy and devoid of humor. It is something like the opposite of Shakespeare in that it seems to hate the language, and have it out for it. Not only is it stylistically deficient, but filled with grammatical errors, as well. Now, I don't claim to be perfect when it comes to grammar--I'm certain I split my infinitives at times, too--but then, I'm not a best selling author armed with professional editors, etc., you know? <br /> <br />The plot is full of holes if you're the kind to bother about that sort of thing. It's not likely you'll have the energy to care about the holes, however, as you simply try to overcome plot elements such as a character using projectile flatulence as a weapon. (And I wish I were making that up.) <br /> <br />The philosophy of the piece, in so far as it displays any, seems to be that humans are bad: bad to our environment, bad to the animals, just bad in general. It is a point of view that's neither original nor particularly entertaining. What *is* unique about Colfer's presentation of this idea is that the fairy world he constructs in order to show us how awful we are (by using the fairies as a foil--they respect endangered species whereas we don't, etc.) turn out to be just as bad, if not worse, than we humans. It would be almost witty, if intentional, as a commentary on hypocrisy. Sadly, I think it's not intentional, and instead reflects some sort of unexamined hypocrisy in the creator. <br /> <br />Allin all, what a disappointment. I did not pick up this book hoping to hate it. As a fan of Harry Potter, Narnia, the Phantom Tollbooth, A Wrinkle in Time and a plethora of other children/young adult lit, I was hoping to find another author and world to adore. But it turns out that this offering lacks almost all of the skill, grace and charm that define those other classics, and I sadly have concluded that this book might better be named \\"The Meal Ticket.\\" <br /> <br />Don't waste your time with this book, or let your children waste theirs; there are libraries full of better possibilities out there.	2005-08-18

It is almost exactly what you expect a \\"classic\\" to be. It is brilliant, insightful and precise. More than that, it is *real*--it forces you to reflect on yourself, and the world, and can teach you things about both. It really is the psychological masterpiece everyone says it is, as it dives deeply into the mind of a murderer. <br /> <br />Also, however, it is wordy--because it is so precise, it sometimes takes a long time to say what it is trying to say. This can be dull on occasion, and makes it a hard book to read late into the night. When you read Crime and Punishment, you will *feel* as though you're reading a classic, unlike experiences I've had reading authors like Tolstoy, Dumas, Dickens, Twain and others where eventually I just felt like I was reading a story.  <br /> <br />And so, your experience reading Crime and Punishment will largely depend on what features of a novel are most important to you. If you are drawn to novels because of their fast paced, exciting plots and energetic characters, give this one a pass. If, however, you read novels for their illuminations of human nature, then this might just be the book for you. Like I say, it is certainly a classic novel... but not everyone will enjoy reading it.	2005-08-18

We don't really care about the attempted murders that occur because the author doesn't want us to care; he wants the mood of the novel to be light and frothy from start to end, and that's fine with me. It does make it strange that I found this novel in the Mystery aisle; it't not a mystery, at all. It's a light romance/black comedy--know that going in. <br /> <br />The characters are slightly uneven. Hiassen puts more energy into developing his more-unseemly characters, especially Chaz and Tool (and the unforgetable, if brief, appearances of 'the Captain') than his \\"heroes.\\" Joey, Mick and Rolvaag are all pretty flavorless, and Hiassen's strategems in making them interesting (\\"Hey! I know! I'll give Rolvaag snakes! Yeah--that'll make him a cool character!\\") all fall flat. He concentrates on the trappings of character--the name, what the character looks like, details of personal history, etc.--rather than the essence. I mean, other than providing some fodder for banter, does it ever matter that Mick had all of those wives? Does it change anything? Not really. <br /> <br />Finally to report, the social message running through the book--that environmentalism is good and anti-environmentalism akin to being murderous and amoral/immoral--is blatant and superficial. Like I say, the author doesn't *want* to be too deep, either emotionally or intellectually, and so I don't mind it that the moral is so over-the-top. Of course, it also renders it sort of toothless. No one anti-environment or on-the-fence is going to walk away from this book feeling any differently. What's slightly more under-the-surface, and thus interesting, is how all of the \\"good guys\\" reject urban society and want to get away from it, Mick and Joey to the island, Rolvaag to his small town and Corbett to his sheep. <br /> <br />All-in-all, not something to go out of your way to read, but not something to go out of your way to avoid, either. A fun little book that'll last you about a week and bring a few smiles, but won't ultimately change your life in any other way.	2005-08-18

We know it. <br /> <br />This penultimate chapter in the Harry Potter story feels in the main like a wonderful prelude to what will certainly be a thrilling finale. The plot, normally the focus of a Harry Potter novel, takes a back seat here to character development and the relationships between the characters (Harry and Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione, etc.). Normally, I wouldn't like the shift in focus--I'm a plot-oriented kind of guy--but Rowling has certainly earned it with her wonderful series, and in the end I'm glad to have had some down time with the characters I know and love, rather than just see them racing around. And, really, there's a lot of plot obviously coming in book seven. A lot. <br /> <br />Ultimately, this novel felt like a swimmer's taking a deep breath before the long plunge. I think Harry realizes that too, given his final reflection on the last page. After this book, with its focus on personality, relationship and backstory, I expect a rollercoaster finish, wall to wall with spills and chills. <br /> <br />This book rates five of five stars because it is a fine entry in a five star series, and because it is enjoyable from cover to cover. Rowling in the first six books of this series has given me absolutely no reason to doubt her ability to deliver in the seventh. <br /> <br />I can't wait.	2005-07-23
US	44880576	R2MY9DZ9TESJY8	055357342X	549456361	A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)	Books	3	332	401	N	N	Unabated Frustration Costs Martin One Star	I've read through some of the other reviews of the first three books of this series and I think it time to address a few of the most commonly cited complaints. <br /> <br />First: the sex. Yes, there is a lot of graphic sexuality in these novels. But, you know, there's a lot more warfare, fighting, murder and mutilation. These books are about warfare and political intrigue. If you're bound to be offended by anything graphically described, then these are not the novels for you as the pages are rife with blood and gore. Sex, in comparison, is kind of a friendly diversion even if it is described in terms devoid of romance and rose petals. If, on the other hand, you are offended by sexuality but not by graphic violence, then there are more pressing questions for you to consider than which fantasy novel to read. <br /> <br />Second: character deaths. Yes, there are a lot of character deaths. Too many? Not enough? Hmm... I'd say just about right. It keeps things healthy, to have cared-for characters die every so often: it keeps you on your toes. Also, given the aforementioned subject matter, war and intrigue, it simply wouldn't make sense not to have death now and again. Finally, there are so many characters and so many plots running around that death is a nice way of keeping things rather more in hand. I do have a complaint regarding the character deaths, however, which I will come to soon. <br /> <br />Third: the gray morality. Yes, the characters are round and multi-faceted. Everyone has virtues, everyone has flaws. (Well, okay, I'd be hard-pressed to find the virtues in some of them, like Gregor or Joff, but still...) But, you know, that doesn't mean that the characters can't be seen as heroic or villainous. Just because Hitler loved animals and was a vegetarian (which is true) doesn't mean he didn't have some rather defining characteristics. C'mon-you know who the heroes and who the villains are. And, while our opinions do sometimes change (Jaime's character, for instance, starts to change over the course of this book), the reason that they do so is not because there is no morality present, but precisely because there is. But here, I again have my own complaint, which I shall deal with presently. <br /> <br />Having dealt with the gripes of others, it's now time for me to develop my own. My problem with Martin's morality is that he makes it appear that, roughly, good = stupid. If there were a hard and fast rule in his world, it would seem to be that being an honorable person will certainly lead to pain, humiliation and death. Often, the problems that the more heroic characters encounter are of their own devise, and it usually comes from blindly trusting and acting honorably to the more villainous characters. And so, Ned warns Cersei of his discovery instead of immediately taking action. Robb releases Theon to his home. Rodik refuses to attack on Winterfell until too late, trusting in his enemy's honor (despite knowing his enemy to have none). Catelyn releases Jaime. Renly and Stannis refuse to attack King's Landing, again until too late. Loras pledges himself to Joffrey instead of striking him down. Cate and company trust Frey. Sansa trusts, well, everyone she shouldn't. Time after time, the heroes have the ability and the opportunity to win the day, and time after time they drop the ball and allow villainy to succeed. It has been said that all it takes for evil to win is for good men to do nothing. In this series, good men often surpass doing nothing by doing extremely stupid things to the advantage of the evil. And this is not to mention Tyrion, who is a heroic character completely enthralled to his villainous family and keeping them alive and kicking more than any other. The villains in this series would have no hope of winning at all if it were not for the active interference (sometimes unwitting), in their favor, of the heroes. It's like reading a big, adult Series of Unfortunate Events populated by several Mr. Poes who continually place orphans in Olaf's hands and refuse to hear their warnings (much like Ned dismissed Arya's warnings, just prior to his being arrested/decapitated). And that is a little frustrating, the difference being that this frustration is primarily what Snicket intends-I am less sure as to Martin's intention. <br /> <br />My second gripe, concerning characters deaths, as promised, is that: the deaths don't always seem to be part of some master plan. Sometimes, the deaths just feel kind of tacked on, either for shock or for \\"realism.\\" And, actually, this is part of a greater concern, the apparent lack of a master plan. As a for instance, way back in book one, you remember how Sansa's wolf, Lady was killed, and how that felt significant? As though, eventually, it would somehow matter that Sansa didn't have her wolf with her? Well... Sansa hasn't really gone through anything better or worse than any of the other Starks, and she's much more alive than some, including one who kept his wolf all the way to the end. It rather seems that Lady's death wasn't particularly significant. And that's the way a lot of the events feel including, sadly, character deaths. Again, this could be viewed as \\"realistic.\\" But I prefer it when realism is subordinated to drama-when fictional events seem to have form and shape and direction as opposed to the chaos and borderline randomness of the real world. When a character dies, I want there to be a compelling reason for the death, being as it is such an inherently compelling event. Martin sometimes seems to kill his characters out of a sort of whimsy. <br /> <br />My third and final gripe remains roughly the same as it was with the first two books and is, in a nutshell, this: too damned long. Forget the page count; Martin's writing is good enough to read for ten thousand pages, I mean that he's taking too long to get to the point. This third installment of the series ends in a quick succession of highpoints. It's meant to build interest and steam going into the fourth, which it does (frustratingly so, given the time between releases). But most of the third book, like most of the second and the first before it, are build up. Three thousand pages of build up are simply not welcome, and certainly not in the face of a projected three thousand to come. There was even a point, somewhere near page 600 of this book, where I started to question my investment. After all, do I have any assurance that the next book, or the book after, will offer any satisfaction? How long will I have to wait, exactly, for any sort of a sense of closure on anything? How good is Martin's heart? His cholesterol count? Blood sugar? I suppose, on the bright side, that this series helps a person develop their patience and endurance. But, I'll tell you, couple this with my doubts of Martin's having a master plan, and you have a potential nightmare in the making. Is it still possible that he does have a direction in mind, and that book six will end up with all of the strings neatly tied in a satisfactory bow? Yes-that's still possible. But the hope dwindles with every passing page. <br /> <br />In the end, I will continue. Onwards to book four, I say, and quick about it. Frankly, I may have invested too much to turn back, now, no matter what happens. But I'm punishing Martin with one star less on this novel than I'd awarded the previous two. The book has the same quality as the others in the series, and the last fifty pages or so are rather exhilarating (and the scene with Sansa building the castle in the snow is just awesome-the kind of thing Martin must have had planned for a long time), but the slight problems become large over time, sort of like Malcolm's explanation of fractals and chaos theory in Jurassic Park, or something. Unabated, these problems will choke him all the way down to a single star by series end. I only pray it doesn't come to that.  <br />	2005-07-11

While such an idea may seem wonderful at first blush, on further reflection drawbacks come to mind. Part of the thrill of lovemaking-or of reading a novel-is rising tension. But tension largely produces pleasure via anticipation of a release of tension. A climax. If tension continues to rise, unceasing, and there is no climax, no release, no end, then what had once produced pleasure can eventually result in pain. <br /> <br />A Clash of Kings, the second in A Song of Ice and Fire, is very well written. The characters are well drawn, interesting and distinct, and the plot is compelling. Everything is described clearly and crisply. And yet, I once again feel compelled to rate Martin's novel four rather than the five stars that it might otherwise deserve. And, again, for the oddest of reasons. Part of an issue that I have developed with this novel is that of tension and climax. It is essentially all rising tension, as was its predecessor. For those keeping count, I've read about seventeen hundred pages of this series so far, two out of a projected six book series (or so I've heard), each being a little shy of the thousand-page mark, and hardly a thing has been resolved thus far. Prolonged rising tension, as noted earlier, can eventually graduate from pleasure to pain when there is no relief or release, and so it is, here. Martin is in love with, and good at constructing, cliffhangers. Nearly every chapter ends in a cliffhanger. I'm certain that many people would argue that this is a great feature, and what am I complaining about that for, but the problem is that people can't run marathons at a sprint pace, either literally or figuratively. Yes, as Martin wanted, the cliffhanger structure does keep me turning pages, does keep me picking up his book, all to the good. But it also has me sailing through chapters looking for something (even the slightest of matters) to be ultimately resolved, and now discouraged because I have to assume that I won't have many more answers a thousand pages from now. <br /> <br />Most novels of much shorter length sprinkle some climax and resolution throughout their plots as means of rewarding, and resting, their readers. If you eat coffee ice cream, and nothing but coffee ice cream, non-stop for hours on end, your taste buds will acclimate and eventually you won't really notice the flavor any more. However, if you rest for, say, ten minutes, every so often, when you come back to the ice cream it will again be fresh and flavorful. Action packed novels, like A Clash of Kings, need periods of rest to allow readers to replenish their emotions in order to be able to feel the rising tension again. They need some climax, and some resolution, along the way. They need some variation in pacing, shifts in speed. Especially novels, and series, as long as this one. <br /> <br />Also, and this is probably also accountable to the incredible length (and also complexity of plot), even after two gargantuan novels, it is hard to see where the series is going. It's hard to know, not what will be the final climax, but what even could be the final climax. As a for instance, somewhere near the beginning of Star Wars, we understand that eventually it will come down to a confrontation between Skywalker and Vader. In Rocky, we know that the crux will be Rocky's confrontation with Creed. In Thelma and Louise, we know that the final climax will be a resolution of their flight-either they'll find a way to get back into society, or they won't in a profound way (incarceration, death, disappearing into another country). In A Clash of Kings, there are so many major characters and so many major events all awaiting a resolution, that I can't even precisely piece out what forms the core conflict requiring resolution. Or what event short of global annihilation could bring about such a resolution. Is there a main protagonist or antagonist? Perhaps the Houses of Stark and Lannister provide those. Or, perhaps not (what of Daenerys, for instance, or the oncoming Winter)? <br /> <br />And so, I enjoy this series and think quite highly of it for many reasons. Tomorrow, I buy the third of the series. But I have little hope that I'll feel fulfilled by it-it probably will tease and leave me hanging, like the two before-which I find slightly unkind to what has to be a dedicated readership. With so much invested, and so many questions, it can only be hoped that there will eventually be answers. And Mr. Martin, if you're reading, don't take the global annihilation ploy; this series demands something better. <br />	2005-05-26

If it's not too late for you (i.e., you haven't yet attempted a read), allow me to try to save you some pain. I suggest you skim through the reviews here on Amazon. Read the one star reviews, and consider. As for the five star reviews (and there aren't many between these two extremes), allow me to pull some choice quotes so that you don't have to strain through each one:    \\"Lovable characters, hatable baddies. You always know what to think of a character.\\"    \\"The villains are really horrible - no bones about it. You just want to watch the hero wipe 'em all out, with no second thoughts. These elements are really pretty fairy-tale-ish. Most modern-day books don't have such black-and-white heroes and villains, and I found it a refreshing change.\\"      \\"[...]it is not what ud call ground breaking[...]\\"    \\"It isn't very deep and is not meant to be.\\"    \\"I noticed on some of the other reviews critism about a 'juvenile' writing style: I beg to differ - I find it's refreshing! I am as literate as anyone but when I read a story I like to read a story, not a jumble of often extraneous words or ponderous thoughts.\\"    \\"Hubbard writes at an average 15 year-old reading level, which makes it slightly awkward, but the feeling of the novel can reach out to any aged reader. There are subtle points in the novel that are a little hard to notice and are quite ridiculous.[...]The story drags on a little long and you can get bored with it rather quickly if you're not interested in sci-fi before you read it.\\"    \\"Granted the names of the characters and most of the events are absolutely ludicrous but Hubbard wrote it like that intentionally. It's a wonderful pulp sci-fi satire. And to those of you who think it's too far-fetched, it's sci-FICTION for god's sake.\\"    \\"Admittedly, the science in this book is very weak. If you come to this book looking for a world that could actually happen... look somewhere else,you won't find it here.[...]If you are looking for a serious story, the light, cheesy narrative might turn you off.\\"    \\"...the last 100 or so pages are not needed...who cares if its entirely impossible...since when does a FICTION novel have to be possible[...]\\"    \\"Don't read this looking for great literature.\\"    \\"I actually like the hit on psychology at the end. It's a fake science at best!\\"    \\"i understand the bad reviews, you need to approach it with a tongue-in-check attitude.\\"    \\"That said, there are some things about it that may turn off some people. Namely, some of the things in the book are incredibly cheesy.[...]Also, there are some rather poor stereotypes in this book.\\"    \\"I thought that I would get tired of the cheesiness of some of the things in the book, like the names of things (Johnny Goodboy Tyler, the Basher Bash Your Way to Glory Battle Tank, etc.), but somehow it just didn't stop being fun. The only thing I disliked were a few minor plot holes.\\"    \\"Some of the phrasing is a little odd, I get a sense that Hubbard was fumbling a bit as he tried to tell the story, and a few of the scientific issues I find somewhat suspect, but it's still a good read though quite long.\\"    \\"Yes, it istrue that this book relies on rather tired cliches, (Johnny Tyler is good, the aliens are bad, aliens lose, humans triumph, etc.)[...]It won't change the way you like at the world, or even give you a deep emotional connection to the characters[...]\\"    \\"It is not a book if you want rich character development or profound social messages.\\"    \\"It's definitely a 'guy' book, though, not as unisex as Tolkien's Lord of the Rings[...]\\"    \\"Read it for the sci-fi, not for any inner enlightenment as it's not there.\\"    \\"Somewhere in my literary education I was imbued with a prejudice against 'popular literature,' and was taught to 'appreciate' the classics - Homer, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Cervantes, Jane Austen, Tolstoy, Balzac, Conrad, Henry James, James Joyce and so on.[...]And then I found and read Battlefield Earth! Oh, my goodness! I had to rethink my whole education![...]Here was a book that defied all my precepts of literature!\\"    \\"...yes, it defies 'proper' writting. Just because it's different doesn't make it bad.[...]To say the least, this book is unlike any novel you have ever read. Just because the book isn't full of useless literary techniques, and other things only English teachers would find, doesn't mean it's not good.\\"    \\"[...]it's not the deepest Sci-Fi ever (Or even close)[...]\\"    \\"While there are many plot holes through the book and many inconsistencies in character development, including poor writing in parts, predictability of certain situations, etc. it is nonetheless a great read[...]\\"    \\"Although I normally read more intellectualy structured fiction, Hubbard somehow has the knack of creating an entertaining story that is fun to read despite it's intentionally low-brow approach.\\"    \\"This book was not meant to be a 'deep' sci-fi novel like Asimov's and others.\\"    \\"Its simplicity makes it intense.\\"    \\"Who cares if he doesn't have verb agreement? Just read the books and enjoy them, stop dissecting them.\\"    \\"Battlefield Earth isn't too subtle, and if you like your sci-fi 'deep' you might be a little turned off by BE.\\"    \\"A no brainer to read.\\"     These only represent the serious 5-star reviews, not the joke ones like:    \\"One of the most enlightening books I have read since Al Gore's Earth in the Balance. The movie is even better only Waterboy was more insightful.\\"    (I'd also like to note the suspicious similarities between many of the five-star reviews, especially the early ones, usually short, written anonymously. Many compare the villain, Terl, to Darth Vader saying \\"Terl makes Darth Vader look like (fill in the blank).\\" No conspiracy theorist here, just saying...)    What I think you'll notice is that the 1-star and 5-star reviewers tend to agree on the basics: shallow characters, unbelievable plot, weak science, etc. It's just that one group cares about that sort of thing and the other does not. I know what camp I'm in; you decide where you stand.	2005-05-17

That, and the five star rating, should give you an idea as to where we're going with this. But allow me to try to surprise you a little...    Atlas Shrugged may or may not be a good novel--opinions vary on this, and I can't guarantee how you'll feel when done. You may hate it.    The philosophy presented in Atlas Shrugged, Objectivism, may or may not be correct--again, opinions vary, and wildly, and violently. You may decide it is the devil's philosophy.    However you ultimately stand on these two issues, and no matter how your friends/family may feel about Atlas Shrugged, and regardless of what the other reviewers say, you owe it to yourself to give this book a read.    Yeah, I know, it's LONG. True. But it's also very important, and very powerful. It was written decades ago, and seems to draw a new review about every third day. Think about that. I believe that we all owe it to ourselves to confront the big questions of our times, and also to hear out the differing answers that people have to offer. With Atlas Shrugged, and in Rand's larger work, she offers some answers to the main questions of our day that you simply will not get anyplace else. Some people, not all of them stupid, even believe that these answers are right. I would recommend Atlas Shrugged just as I would recommend that people read those that disagree with Rand, and then: decide for yourself. When you're done, and if you've understood, you'll realize that Rand herself wouldn't have had it any other way.	2005-05-14
US	44880576	R3F635XD99KM1T	0553573403	268067011	A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1)	Books	4	9	16	N	N	I Have to Defend My Four-Star Rating, Now	This is quite the fantasy novel. It fulfills everything we normally ask of the genre: well-drawn characters, likable, lovable and detested; sweeping, historic events; mysteries and secret schemes; love, triumph, disaster and tragedy; a fully realized and fleshed-out, internally consistent world with many things to learn and marvel at; an incredibly intricate plot spanning years and dozens and dozens of characters. The writing is clean and clear (with the one caveat listed below), the pacing is fine, the events well orchestrated and the rotating narration admirably executed.<br /><br />It probably should get five stars. However, I give it four for the following two reasons:<br /><br />Reading Thrones is like watching the third round (not quite the first or the second) of a classic heavyweight fight; it knows that it's going the distance, and so here it's feeling things out, testing the waters, establishing its jab if you will. The author obviously has many, many things to say with this series, and he's obviously up to the challenge. At 800 pages, it never felt long. And yet, and for this reason, most of the novel ultimately felt like prologue. Yes, major events do happen and there is some payoff sprinkled along the way... but there are also huge swaths of novel that are almost entirely foreshadowing and rising tension for things yet to come. The reward is withheld, and for that reason in part, one star less. It might be argued that, since I know that the author is merely setting the dominoes for a later fall, I should award him the final star in anticipation. I disagree however; I think that a novel, and especially one of this length, should be arranged to be a stand-alone experience, if need be. It's a prejudice of mine, perhaps, but there it is.<br /><br />The second reason (and I almost hesitate to write this section, because to call attention to minor flaws like this seems to disrespect the overall achievement and marvel of the novel entire, but alas, I am a critic) is this: the writing is inconsistent and slightly unruly. Obviously, as implied above, Martin is a wonderful storyteller. What I mean is that his language is, at times, off-kilter and inconsistent. Maybe to expect more from such an immense project is unfair, but allow me to provide a few examples. Sometimes it seems as though the characters know that they're in an epic fantasy novel, their language is so affected. Perhaps as so many of the characters are courtiers, it explains their pretensions (though they speak that way in private to loved ones, while in dire straits, too), but what of the pretensions of the writer who also seems to understand that he's in a high fantasy world. There are knights in Martin's world. And, they are called \\"knights.\\" Yet their title is \\"Ser\\" as in \\"Ser George Martin.\\" Not \\"Sir,\\" but \\"Ser.\\" Why? They aren't \\"Masters\\" they're \\"Maesters.\\" Why? It's not a \\"jailer\\" but a \\"gaoler.\\" Why? These peculiarities stand out. I truly wish that fantasy authors would realize that it isn't a change in language that makes a world distinctive, and of course, if it were, then what place would wolves, stags and Kings have in this \\"distinct world?\\" But if we keep \\"King\\" and \\"your Grace\\" then why not \\"Sir\\" instead of \\"Ser?\\" And, in the case of \\"gaoler\\" why adopt older English when keeping modern English for most everything else? Inconsistent and silly. Other times, however, the narration drops all pretense and becomes stark and brutal, or even sophomoric: \\"Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt\\" (204). In the first place, what a juvenile description. In the second, I doubt a person with a dagger up anything walks particularly stiffly. The problem I'm getting at is no biggie--just a matter of consistency in narrative voice and good rationale for some other language choices--but I do believe that it is worth about .4 of a star. Also, over the course of the novel, it becomes apparent that Martin hashis own favorite ways of putting things. \\"As [blank] as sin\\" has been used twice (smooth and soft) and he's used \\"As certain as sunrise\\" along with \\"As certain as sunset.\\" The term \\"game of thrones\\" has been used multiple times in dialogue by different characters. And, okay, this is picky and I understand that, but still, if I notice it then it calls attention away from the story and focuses me on the craft of writing. And that's not what Martin is trying to do; that's bad.<br /><br />In the end, my review comes down to this: I feel it necessary to defend my choice to give the book four stars instead of five, and I could perfectly understand others giving it full marks. I'm a picky person who obsesses over errors and who probably chose the right career when I taught High School English. My neuroses aside, if you have any passing interest in the genre, this is almost a must-read, and tomorrow I plan on going out to buy the second in the series. My only hope is that the strengths of the first, which well outweigh any small flaws, continue throughout.in has his own favorite ways of putting things. \\"As [blank] as sin\\" has been used twice (smooth and soft) and he's used \\"As certain as sunrise\\" along with \\"As certain as sunset.\\" The term \\"game of thrones\\" has been used multiple times in dialogue by different characters.

US	44880576	R2ATUYBIW8ZHCA	0967686563	86124043	The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ (Official Edition)	Books	1	16	35	N	N	A Poor Work in Just Every Way	Most of the Mormons I have met in my life have been decent, kind people. Actually, \\"most\\" is perhaps an unfair word--I can't think of a Mormon I've known who wasn't a genuinely good person. My experiences have led me to believe that there must be something in their religion, or in their culture, to account for this. Whatever it is I was looking for, I did not find it in the Book of Mormon.  <br /> <br />Now, please understand, religion is a matter of faith. I happen to be an atheist, and so I cannot see the Book of Mormon in the same way as a believer can. On the other hand, my perspective gives me some unique insights, as well. So does my background in history (a B.A.) and my having read other religious texts such as the Bible, the Koran and the Bhagavad-Gita. <br /> <br />Disclaimers aside (and, I know, the faithful are going to hate what I have to say no matter how many disclaimers I lay down), I must report: I did not like The Book of Mormon.  <br /> <br />As a religious text, it is a disappointment: it seems to encourage racism, as God makes people black as a punishment; the work only touches on morality lightly and superficially (people who agree that Jesus is/will be the Son-of-God are good, those who disagree are bad).  <br /> <br />As an entertaining read, it is a disappointment: for the most part, the Book is a collection of sand-dry war records with almost no color or detail. This is an example of how the Book reads: \\"And then, behold, Group A made war upon Group B and there were many men slain in Group A because they opposed liberty, but Group B remained almost untouched. Yea behold, 420 men in Group A were slain, but only 10 were slain in Group B. And behold, the next year Group C made war upon Group B and Group C was destroyed save for a small number, for they had opposed liberty.\\" Seriously. This is what it is like for hundreds of pages. <br /> <br />As a historical record, it is a disappointment. Frankly, the Book of Mormon is fradulent. It claims tobe the records of Israelites who fled Israel before the Babylonian Captivity--the \\"lost tribes\\" who wound up coming to America; the forerunners to the Native American tribes. However, the book throws around concepts like \\"liberty\\" as though these were fully developed concepts at the time. It also throws around the name \\"Jesus Christ\\" as the ancient Mormon prophets supposedly knew of his coming. It is strange that the Book of Mormon contains no sketchy hints requiring explanation or special pleading, as can be witnessed in people's explanations of Daniel or Isaiah or other Old Testament prophecies. No, the prophets in the Book of Mormon are direct, to the point, and accurate. Eerily so. Tellingly so.  <br /> <br />Further, the Books explanation of the existence of Native Americans runs contrary to the modern evidence of the Asiatic landbridge and DNA, etc. Also, and despite the fact that the Book of Mormon has reportedly several authors (of the various books, like the Bible), the style of each book seems remarkably similar. It is unlike the Bible in this respect; Ecclesiastes is very different from Chronicles which is very dissimilar to Jeremiah which is very unlike Exodus; John does not resemble Matthew stylistically. The Book of Mormon feels like one consistent voice spinning one narrative. This is because one man--Joseph Smith--did write the entire thing, and then he claimed that he found it buried in upstate New York with the help of an angel.  <br /> <br />You see, that is what accounts for the knowledge of modern politcal concepts such as liberty. That is what accounts for the similarity in narrative styles by the \\"different authors\\" of the Book of Mormon. That is what accounts for the knowledge of Native Americans, but lack of knowledge as to their actual origins or DNA evidence, etc. It is because one man wrote this book on the American continent before the discovery of DNA and other forms of evidence. You see? <br /> <br />As I said, I'm an athiest. It wasnever very likely that reading The Book of Mormon would convict me, or convince me, of much. On the other hand, I enjoyed reading the other religious books I'd read much more than this one. I think that those other works are more entertaining, more important morally/religiously, and more important historically. However they might be mistaken, I do not believe that they were written with the same intentional fraud out of which was born the Book of Mormon. <br /> <br />The faithful Mormon will love the book, and will hate me (or if not, at least what I say); that's fine. I understand. But this isn't a good book in any sense. It is a waste of time, energy and effort, and I rather grieve for those who are told from their infancy that it has some relevance to our world.	2005-05-11
US	44880576	R3QVN9M3BC3RPP	0385316348	907556596	The Ranch	Books	1	8	12	N	N	Perhaps Not the Worst Novel Ever	I cannot, with much fairness, say that this is the worst novel of all time. After all, there is an entire world of literature out there, and I've only drawn on one small corner of it. South Africa alone has filled libraries, and to the best of my knowledge I am completely unacquainted with any of it. Then, there are all of the novels written in every conceivable language, most of which I do not understand, and which go untranslated. And then, consider time. Scholars sometimes trace back the modern novel to Don Quixote, written in the early seventeenth century. Right or wrong, if we accept that as our yardstick, that gives us roughly four hundred years of novels. What an immensity! And all of this is accepting that Earth is the only planet in the Universe (which Einstein deemed infinite) that produces such works. All in all, there have been at least a great, enormous heap of novels throughout history and it is potentially many magnitudes greater than we could imagine. I have only read some infinitesimal portion of them.<br /><br />And so, I cannot honestly proclaim this to be the worst. Further, it is even unlikely. After all, Ms. Steel has written a scad of novels herself, and this is the only one I've read. I must imagine that this is neither the best nor the worst of her oeuvre  (though hopefully on the bottom-half) and thus it is highly imaginable that she alone has written some few, worse books. And, despite the chills this contemplation gives me, given Steel's great financial success, I can only surmise that most of her competitors are derivative and/or plain worse.<br /><br />But I can, without fear or hesitation, say this: The Ranch is a bad novel. Really, very, quite bad.<br /><br />It does not do justice to the term \\"flat character\\" to say that Steel's are flat. They aren't flat, they are translucent. They are transparent. They occupy negative space. But they are always well-dressed, and how! You get to read descriptions of their wardrobe, and the care that they put into making themselves up, for pages and pages, with repetition ad nauseum. They're shellacked in other ways, too. They are, each of them, practically perfect in every way. Take the main, er, heroine. She maintains the perfect home (to the point that it has covered Better Homes & Gardens, or something like that) and spends her free time volunteering at some sort of shelter in Harlem! The men and women in this book, the ones we're supposed to sympathize with at any rate, are like biting into a cake that has no cake at all, only frosting. And then realizing that the frosting sucks.<br /><br />The events of the novel (\\"plot\\" would be too generous) are obvious, boring and utterly contrived. There just happens to be one attractive man for each woman (and there are no competitions between any of them for anything) and each courtship proceeds about as smoothly as possible; obstacles simply fall by the wayside at the necessary moments. The novel glosses over the moral implications of infidelity with such speed it makes you wonder at the author's own morality. In fact, that brings me to my next, and last, topic...<br /><br />I've looked at some other reviews of this novel complaining of the grammar. True, the grammar is atrocious, but so what? Grammar is important but can ultimately be forgiven if the other elements are strong. And then there are my complaints, that this book is utterly lacking in plot, character, voice, theme or just about any other conceivable element that goes into the creation of fiction. But that isn't the real tragedy, here. The real tragedy is the insight, forced unwillingly upon the reader, into the souls and lives that must constitute Danielle Steel's main readership. Who are these people that read this tripe, and enjoy it? Who are they that believe in these stereotypical, incredibly shallow characters? That believe that \\"romance\\" really is about candlelit dinners and walks down the beach-not the honest exchange, learning, compromise and hard work that creates true relationships? That ask no more of their fiction than a simplistic and completely unconvincing fantasy transport from their lives, the fictive equivalent to the board game Candyland?  Rather than trying to answer these questions, I'd rather leave them open for us all, to mourn in our own ways.<br /><br />For those fans of Ms. Steel who happen to be reading this review-and I don't expect many; I don't believe most of them to be a) computer literate or b) the type to read reviews-please allow me to suggest that there is better out there. If you were to accidentally stumble and crash into a bookshelf at your local library (perhaps somewhere removed from the romance section) your odds of hitting your head on a better book are about 93%. And by better, I mean better written, more enjoyable, more realistic, more meaningful, more thoughtful, more intelligent, more emotional, more, better.

That ask no more of their fiction than a simplistic and completely unconvincing fantasy transport from their lives, the fictive equivalent to the board game Candyland?  Rather than trying to answer these questions, I'd rather leave them open for us all, to mourn in our own ways. <br /> <br />For those fans of Ms. Steel who happen to be reading this review-and I don't expect many; I don't believe most of them to be a) computer literate or b) the type to read reviews-please allow me to suggest that there is better out there. If you were to accidentally stumble and crash into a bookshelf at your local library (perhaps somewhere removed from the romance section) your odds of hitting your head on a better book are about 93%. And by better, I mean better written, more enjoyable, more realistic, more meaningful, more thoughtful, more intelligent, more emotional, more, better.

If you're like me, you're picking up The Canterbury Tales because it's one of those classics that you eventually have to read to be one of the \\"literati.\\" Or, and actually more likely, you're being forced to read it by some professor somewhere. As such, you're ready for a dry and dusty tome, struggling for every page. But that's not what's here. <br /> <br />The Canterbury Tales is much more entertaining, much more visceral and much more fanciful than many of the works that have followed it (and most of the classics). It is a collection of short stories that runs the gamut, from precious religious narrative to bawdy toilet-humor. Most all of it is in verse (usually couplets) and the reading is fast and fun. My personal favorite comes first in the Knight's Tale, but the whole is filled with surprises and engrossing stories. Reading the Tales, you'll also have an interesting perspective into a society many hundreds of years past--a society that turns out to be not far different from our own. <br /> <br />I'd also like to take this opportunity to recommend a modern fantasy/sci-fi novel that is kind of a take on the Tales entitled Hyperion by Dan Simmons.  <br /> <br />So, to conclude, if you are sitting up in your dorm room, staring at the Tales, trying to figure out how to approach: just start. It'll do the work for you.	2005-05-03

After all, I am a guy and disposed to guy-ly things like action movies and bbq ribs. Pride and Prejudice, on the other hand, is a quaint British novel about a group of daughters and their various courtships and marriages. The main plot concerns whether one of these daughters-Lizzy-can or cannot overcome her initial dislike of a good man who subsequently falls in love with her. The device by which this plot operates, and extends into over three-hundred pages, is that everyone is either too scared, or too proper, to say what they really feel. The novel is conversation, conversation and more conversation, and almost all of it in an affected upper-class British speak where one talks around things, never about them. It does not entail much action-when it does it is usually characters traveling to a new locale to talk some more, and there is no bbq to be found at all, and so as I say, it is not, and by its nature cannot be, my favorite novel of all time. And yet, it is a testament to the skill of the author (and this is the first Austen I've read, and she has lived up to the hype surrounding her name) that, despite my lack of inherent interest in the subject matter, she managed to sustain my attention and, what's more, I can say that I completely enjoyed the reading. I would even be willing to read more of the same by the same. Her characters are interesting, distinct and likable, her dialogue true, and her descriptions sparse, witty and to-the-point.<br /><br />I give the novel 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed it, liked the characters and thought it well-written overall. It only loses its one star for being about things that do not compel me particularly; I'm sure that those who are predisposed to like conversation-driven British literature about social mores and marriage will rate it the full five.	2005-04-20

I, Claudius, though filled with tragic events and villains triumphant, walks a lightened path because one knows that the narrator-a good man and devoted republican-is destined to survive, and become Emperor. By that same token, however, Claudius the God is headed into dark woods. We know that Claudius will be assassinated, that the evil Nero will succeed him, and that the Republic will never be restored. So, whatever small joys we might take in the events of the novel, a shadow is always cast by the knowledge of future events. Also, and to explain the turn of events, the narrator must transform and become increasingly unreliable and unsympathetic, though we are always rooting for him and his doomed ambitions. <br /> <br />Beyond this, the work really is a direct continuation of the first in all ways. It is brilliant, and if you loved the first book and want more resolution than it provides (such as what becomes of Caligula's assassins, or whether his marriage with Messalina proves happy) then you'll likely want to continue on. You won't be disappointed with the presentation, only possibly with the answers. I'm happy I read this book, and feel it has all of the strengths of the first, but I can also understand why it hasn't received the same attention. It doesn't have the usual Hollywood ending and may leave the reader a little cold.	2005-04-15
US	44880576	R9LK9J46AXR18	067972477X	111847135	I, Claudius From the Autobiography of Tiberius Claudius Born 10 B.C. Murdered and Deified A.D. 54 (Vintage International)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A Wonderful Read for Anyone	It helps, perhaps, to have some knowledge of Ancient Roman History in order to appreciate this work, but the beauty of this novel is that it is by no means required. Robert Graves takes a complicated and distant history and makes it immediate, approachable and human. The characters, and especially Claudius himself, are realistically drawn-they don't feel ancient, they feel modern, and it helps to bring home the truth that people are, and always have been, people. <br /> <br />While watching these (primarily nasty) characters work their poison is fascinating, I, Claudius is mostly a history, better told than just about any history you'll ever read. And, as history, it is instructive and comes across as being meticulously researched. The details only rarely get in the way. The narrative is fairly depressing as it chronicles the solidifying of the Roman Empire, hot on the heels of the demise of the Republic. It reminds us how precious our freedoms and political institutions really are, and how ready people can be to throw those things away in exchange for a little perceived gain, or simply out of cowardice. So easily is dignity lost, it makes one wonder whether it ever really existed to begin with. The writing style is conversational, like hearing from an old, family friend, the narrator being very sympathetic and only slightly untrustworthy. <br /> <br />It isn't a difficult read at all, it is entertaining, educational, philosophical and a modern classic that will give insight into today and tomorrow. In short, there is almost no reason not to read this novel, and several to recommend it.	2005-04-15
US	44880576	R2GWBWB71SWH6Z	0679722769	705442339	Ulysses	Books	1	50	80	N	N	A Difference of Opinion	Random House, calling on English Professors and other literary professionals, declared James Joyce's Ulysses as the greatest novel of the 20th Century. <br /> <br />Who am I to disagree? <br /> <br />While I may not have too many initials following my name, I'd like to believe that my opinion about Ulysses is valid in its own right. After all, I have taken the trouble to read the thing. Also, I have a bachelor's degree, and have taught High School English. I've also read an exegesis of Ulysses, and am currently reading Finnegans Wake, so I do have something in the way of qualifications. At heart, I account my opposing opinion to the fact that I believe that the standards that I use to judge the merits of a novel are different than those employed by the fellows at Random House. Further, I think that my criteria aren't necessarily all that bad. <br /> <br />Indeed, I like to believe that my criteria are probably closer to what most people look for in a novel. <br /> <br />The things that I look for in a novel include: an exciting plot; memorable, interesting characters; clean, crisp writing. <br /> <br />The things that I believe the Random House voters look for in a novel include: intricate word play; obscure literary allusion/allegory; originality in form and syntax, even to the point of obfuscation. <br /> <br />Ulysses certainly is a winner in the second category, as all eight hundred pages of it concern one man on one day in his life. Most of those pages are devoted to word play, literary allusions, experiments in literary form, etc. What Ulysses does not spend a lot of time on, however, is developing plot and character--the things I love in a good book. There is almost no clean, crisp writing to be found--Joyce's primary consideration was not to be understood; he wanted to be *clever*.  <br /> <br />For instance, take the \\"word overture.\\" At the beginning of the \\"Siren section,\\" (Ulysses is modeled after The Odyssey), Joyce mirrors the overture of a musical by running together out-of-context fragments and snatches of words from the chapter to come. He does this without preamble or explanation and reading it is a very confusing experience. But Joyce didn't write it with the intention of being clear--he had something artistic to say, or something experimental to try, or something like that. Please understand that this makes Joyce very, very different from most of the masters who preceeded him, such as Thomas Hardy, Leo Tolstoy, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc. They wrote in an effort to communicate themselves very clearly; Joyce wants to be difficult. They wanted to write interesting stories, Joyce wants something altogether different. <br /> <br />For myself, I neither like Joyce's style nor his intentions. I honestly cannot figure out the point, other than cleverness for cleverness' sake. Further, I believe that his method, which has become the main literary aesthetic in schools (which is why they all concentrate so much on literary devices such as metaphor and allegory), has been detrimental to education. By turning literature from entertaining stories into puzzle solving, I believe he has turned many children away from reading. I think this helps to account for, say, J.K. Rowling's success. It's not that kids don't like to read, it's that they don't like to read things like Ulysses or similar efforts by Joyce's admirers. <br /> <br />Many people reading this will likely disagree with me. They think that Joyce was a \\"genius.\\" That's fine--they're entitled to their opinions. But, I'm entitled to mine as well, and, in my opinion, Ulysses does not say nearly enough of importance to be worth all the trouble it is to decode, and in the end it is simply not a lot of fun. In my opinion, there are tons of other books that have just as much of value (if not more), and *also* have exciting plots, interesting characters and clear writing. Joyce was, perhaps, a genius at puzzle-writing and encoding, but Ulysses is a poor novel.	2005-03-26

It is very good and, in certain respects, very corrupting. <br /> <br />One observation I did make is that some of the film versions made from this novel (for instance Dangerous Liasons, Valmont and the modern-telling, Cruel Intentions) are quite faithful to the book. If you're familiar with those films, it is unlikely you'll find much here that's new. Also, the tone of the novel (written as epistles, remember) might be a little off-putting to modern readers; it is upper-class with stilted sentence structure and an extensive vocabulary, and tends to hint at, rather than outright say, what it means. Sometimes the letters repeat themselves a little bit, just as letters do in real life. <br /> <br />If you're already a fan of this story, you will probably enjoy reading the novel. If you're new to the story, you will probably enjoy it more. I, myself, was hoping for something that would expand on/develop further the story I'd already seen in the movies, but found that the movies really had shown me what it was all about.	2005-03-19
US	44880576	ROWMDF4C0OTDH	0140444955	78796814	The Federalist Papers (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	19	24	N	N	Fascinating...For the Right Person	You don't need to be told that the Federalist Papers are not for everyone, but for a niche audience of which I happen to be a member. And so, the qualifications: you need to have a pretty fluent command of the English language, and not just modern usage but also more archaic structure and vocabulary; you have to have a good grasp of history, at least a rough outline of it solidly in mind; you have to have a love for politics, political science and the Constitution.<br /><br />If all of that is true of you, you'll probably enjoy reading this. At least, to a point. The Federalist Papers, written mainly by \\"Father of the Constitution\\" James Madison and \\"Shot by Aaron Burr/Closet-Monarchist\\" Alexander Hamilton, is a very lengthy defense of the then-proposed Constitution, point by point. And what I mean is, they will take items over which there could be seemingly no substantial debate and then write a series of three or four essays on that point. And so, it is possible that even the die-hard history/political science buff will be bored by the thirtieth page of the debate over whether standing armies should be allowed to be kept during peace time.<br /><br />The most laugh-out-loud moment (and yeah, there are a few) is when the \\"Interstate Commerce clause\\" is dismissed in a slip of a paragraph, which is, of course, one of the most important and controversial passages to the modern reading of the Constitution, forming the basis for a good deal of our current legislation. Whatever one feels about our current \\"construction\\" of the Constitution, I think a fair reading of the literature will show that it is not the same construction as that of its authors.<br /><br />Not laugh-out-loud at all, however, is the roaring silence on the subject of slavery. It does come up, from time to time, but the lack of debate on these matters (there are, maybe, 2-3 pages on the 3/5 compromise and a paragraph on the ending of the slave trade) proclaims the volatility of the subject matter, even 100 years before the Civil War. Madison wasn't looking to offend his audience, after all.<br /><br />Of course, all of these debates are mostly moot (with a couple of exceptions) and so the Federalist Papers are largely a historical artifact... but there is something very telling about them. That is, how incredibly learned, intelligent and eloquent our Founding Fathers really were. They debate calling on historical antiquity, philosophies ancient and modern, then-current foreign political systems, the Constitutions of the several states and the Articles of Confederation. These people knew what they were doing and it all mattered to them, very much. It's kind of sobering to see with what care and deliberation they forged this Constitution, and then to compare it with the \\"guardians of the flame\\" today who can't even seem to agree on the meaning of terms like \\"liberty,\\" \\"democracy,\\" or, in the case of one former President, \\"is.\\" When reading, you'll wish we had Madisons and Hamiltons today, or even politicians who bothered to read them... or, maybe we do, but the general level of care and education of our country today does not allow men such as those to rise.

In that sense, I do believe he finally outshines Douglas Adams who was always most concerned about dazzling with cleverness. <br /> <br />This novel is hard to put down. When you're done, you will have fallen in love with the characters and wish that there was a sequel for you to follow their continuing adventures. The style is clean and direct, the tone something like a Tim Burton production--colorful and interesting and slightly sinister. <br /> <br />For fans of fun stories, endearing characters and wry humor, this is for you.

It is not for everyone. <br /> <br />Ayn Rand's The Virtue of Selfishness is a powerful statement of part of her philosophy, Objectivism. Specifically, it is a collection of essays dealing with the Ethics of her philosophy. She advocates \\"rational selfishness\\" as being opposed to selflessness or altruism. She advocates that people act to make themselves healthy and happy--that this is good, and not something for which people should suffer guilt. She argues that people should not feel compelled to make sacrifices for others, which stands in direct opposition to most mainstream ethical systems, such as Christianity (which is based upon a sacrifice, after all). <br /> <br />It is controversial and in-your-face. Rand holds nothing back. She does not pretend to have sympathy for other points of view. She says that what she has to say is true, and then attempts to prove it. Whether you finally agree with her or not, one of the most refreshing aspects of reading Rand is her honesty. She does not try to hide her opinions. Everything is clearly laid out. The writing is concise, using words neither larger than necessary nor smaller. She defines her terms as she goes, aiming for complete understanding. You will never read a writer (and especially in philosophy) who displays more respect for her reader. She dares you to disagree--to prove her wrong. <br /> <br />On the other hand, as I say, Rand is not for everyone, and for precisely the same reasons that make her such a compelling read. If you have any sacred cows going in, they will likely be butchered. It can be quite uncomfortable to have your most basic beliefs threatned and attacked outright, and thus a little introspection prior to reading this may be best. <br /> <br />This book is designed for: people who are comfortable in debate-type situations; people who are earnestly interested in \\"truth\\", even if said truth hurts; people who believe in the power of logic, and followit to its conclusions; people who respect candor and honest argumentation; people who are used to challenging conventional wisdom and questioning everything. <br /> <br />I picked up this book because I knew of Rand's basic assertions and I thought she was dead wrong. I wanted to read her reasoning and tear it apart.... It didn't work out that way. :) She convinced me through the raw power of her arguments, evidence and logic. As my title states, Enter At Your Own Risk. The Virtue of Selfishness is a powerful little tome.	2005-02-01

I've read several reviews on this site taking Mr. Goldman to task for editing S. Morgenstern's classic, The Princess Bride. Please allow me to set the record straight.    S. Morgenstern is a distant relation of mine. It had been very difficult in my early years, trying to explain to others about my Florinese heritage, when Florin is so little known and almost never taught in school (just try to search for it on the web--shameful--there's even a fringe group that claims Florin never existed at all)! Thankfully, all of that changed when Goldman wrote his book and even moreso with the release of the delightful film version in 87. Now, I have something to refer to, and even more than that, a family legacy to really be proud of. I am certain that Gilder-Americans feel much the same way, no matter how their anti-defamation league has taken Goldman, et al, to task over their supposed \\"racist portrayal.\\"    You see, I have one of the few extant copies of the original Princess Bride, all leather-bound, gilded, thousand pages of it. And it is dull. I mean, DULL. My mother had to prod me for years before I finally read the thing through. Goldman did the world a favor by abridging it into such a wonderful novel (the Florinese are not known for their brevity) and my family a tremendous favor by giving fame to my ancestor that he does not, honestly, quite deserve.    People have asked me before whether I intend on ever suing for any share of the proceeds of the book or movie. Again, I'd like to clear the air by saying that Mr. Goldman tracked my parents down quite some time ago and made arrangments with them prior to the release of the novel. Mr. Goldman didn't want that made public; I hope that he will overlook my disclosure because I just want the Goldman-bashing to stop.    So, to all of those who've enjoyed this abridgment, I thank you as a scion of S. Morgenstern, but direct you to thank William Goldman all the more. For those who cry injustice at his abridgment, I ask you to stop: it's better this way. Believe me.	2005-02-01

The above quote is to give you a real taste of Red Mars. A very large percentage of the novel is devoted to landscape descriptions like this, or the science background to the geological/terraforming events. Perhaps you're looking into Red Mars for the same reason I chose to give it a read--it won some prestigious awards. Having just finished the book, I can say that it won those awards on the strength of the large amounts of research that obviously went into its creation.    While I applaud those efforts as well, it is also possible that you're like me in that you're seeking a good story with an exciting plot and well-drawn, sympathetic characters. In those respects, Red Mars is quite a disappointment. The characters are fairly flat and, save for the ones that die, they essentially are the same from beginning to end. Further, none are particularly endearing; by the end, I did not care much what happened to them, or who succeeded, or who failed. The plot begins promisingly enough, but once past the first couple hundred pages it begins to meander off, neither building tension nor resolving anything.    Part of the problems lie in the fact that the author wants his story to be \\"epic.\\" Thus, he tells the story over several decades. The problem with this approach is that it distances us from the characters and the plot. There is no sense of immediacy. Also, it underlines the unchanging nature of the characters--surely someone could develop a new insight over thirty years? Further, the pacing is horrendous, punctuated as it is by all of the landscape details as noted above. The truth is that Mars does not have a particularly interesting landscape, being mostly rock and sand. The author tries his darndest to make it interesting, describing it at length, and he occasionally succeeds, but it just becomes frustrating after about page 300. As a parting slap, he makes the last 40 pages or so just about nothing *but* landscape description... sort of a final exam, I suppose. It is alienating and loses whatever interest the events in the story generate.    Lastly to discuss is the philosophy of the piece. I got the impression, throughout, that the author is presenting two extreme sides of an issue (terraforming)--radical environmentalism (Ann) and radical, \\"meddling\\" science/humanism (Sax)--and saying that there must be some sort of compromise we can manage. The only real villain is capitalism (Phyllis/transnational corporations); otherwise, the author wants to be the voice of moderation. Sadly, the author displays very little real sympathy for any of the viewpoints presented and no understanding for those who would genuinely disagree with what he believes to be moderation (a strange form of socialism). His arguments will only seem right to you if you agree with him beforehand. The tone of the writing is clinical. Its prognosis for humanity, bleak.    In all, I'm certain this book has an audience. After all, it has several glowing reviews here and did win those awards for some good reason, no doubt. It represents a mountain of research and, I am sure, painstaking work. Perhaps you are a part of its audience. I am not. The things I look for in a novel include exciting plots, engaging pacing and well-drawn, sympathetic characters who grow and change over the course of the story. This novel fails in those respects. There are two sequels but my journey ends here.	2005-01-30
US	44880576	R13OLK50U9RF0L	0141181265	220749293	Finnegans Wake (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)	Books	1	89	110	N	N	The Emperor has no clothes!	I am convinced that people do not read Finnegans Wake, or at least not in the same sense that we ever normally use the word \\"read.\\" FW is 600+ pages long and I've yet to find more than a handful of standard English sentences among them. In 1999 (this is 2005) I started to read the Wake, with the best of intentions, but I soon noticed a problem. A few paragraphs in, my mind would start to wander, for there was nothing solid that my mind could hang on to. I encountered no setting, no characters, no plot, no narration, nothing concrete nor conceptual. The best that I could say was that every once in a while, some group of words would be evocative of an image or memory, but even when this would happen I could not say for certain whether it was intentional on the part of the author or accident. Eventually, I started reading it aloud in order to keep myself \\"in\\" the book but, no help. Today, I am 100 pages in; I can't really bear to read more than a page at a time, and even this is an effort. I get as close to 'zero' from reading it as I can imagine.<br /><br />Now, please understand that I am not a stupid man, nor unaccustomed to difficult literature. I've a college degree and, in fact, currently teach 10th grade English. I've read (and understood), among other things, Shakespeare, The Bible, War and Peace, and also Ulysses. It is sometimes said that this book was written \\"for the intelligensia\\"... well... I consider myself part of the intelligensia and this book was not written for me. I am not here trying to argue that the book was written as a joke, or has no actual meaning (though I think those arguments have some merit, when one considers the work) but that a person who picks this up and starts running their eyes over any given page will not be engaging in the same activity as they would when reading a book. The Wake might be closer to some sort of giant puzzle, though I doubt this as well, but a prospective reader should ask himself whether he wants to engage in a 600 page rebus. Further, I doubt that the Wake could have been \\"written\\" in the same sense that other books are. Am I to imagine that Joyce had a firm intention in mind that guided his decisions in writing this book? That he, say, edited it? Rearranged sentences for impact? Checked for consistency? Is this book translated into other languages? How could it be? And wouldn't that assume that it had been written in some language to begin with. And, finally, if it's not written in English (and it's not), or in any other intelligble language (and it's not), then in what sense do we have a book?<br /><br />Is everything printed on paper literature?<br /><br />I think not. I do not believe that the Wake was written as a book, and I do not think it possible to read it as one, and I submit the book itself as my evidence. It has occured to me that it would be fun, someday, to take some group of people who've given the Wake 5-star reviews, and then test them. Perhaps we could give them a group of five selections, with one of them a faux-passage and four of them authentic FW-Joyce, and see if they could determine the fake? Or, we could provide them with a passage and then ask for an explanation, and them compare their explanations with one another to see if there's any validity. In fact, FW could make for a great party game along the lines of Balderdash.<br /><br />Yes, FW is perhaps (doubtful, though) a rebus and it could, with some imagination, provide a party game of sorts (largely revolving around mockery), but it is not a book to be read. Don't feel bad--it wasn't intended to be read. Through it all, the most interesting thing and the greatest value of the book is to watch the actions of the book's defenders. They haven't read it either, in any meaningful sense, and yet like the people in the fable they claim to see the clothing. After all, people of the highest virtue are able to see the Emperor's New Clothes, you see. And who wouldn't want to be a part of that group?rebus. Further, I doubt that the Wake could have been \\"written\\" in the same sense that other books are. Am I to imagine that Joyce had a firm intention in mind that guided his decisions in writing this book? That he, say, edited it? Rearranged sentences for impact? Checked for consistency? Is this book translated into other languages? How could it be? And wouldn't that assume that it had been written in some language to begin with. And, finally, if it's not written in English (and it's not), or in any other intelligble language (and it's not), then in what sense do we have a book?    Is everything printed on paper literature?    I think not. I do not believe that the Wake was written as a book, and I do not think it possible to read it as one, and I submit the book itself as my evidence. It has occured to me that it would be fun, someday, to take some group of people who've given the Wake 5-star reviews, and then test them. Perhaps we could give them a group of five selections, with one of them a faux-passage and four of them authentic FW-Joyce, and see if they could determine the fake? Or, we could provide them with a passage and then ask for an explanation, and them compare their explanations with one another to see if there's any validity. In fact, FW could make for a great party game along the lines of Balderdash.     Yes, FW is perhaps (doubtful, though) a rebus and it could, with some imagination, provide a party game of sorts (largely revolving around mockery), but it is not a book to be read.
