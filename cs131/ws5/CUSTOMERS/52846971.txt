With language that is succinct and precise, he takes us on the ultimate surreal journey; the journey of the questions of late middle age.  Gratuitously, Coetzee gives us a clue to the dream journey by calling one main character \\"Marijana,\\" a word/name whose resemblance to the hallucinogen of virtually the same spelling but for one letter is inescapable.  This device allows Coetzee to do a unique and wonderful thing.  It allows him to have an entire book that represents one man's conversation with himself, complete with graphic images. <br /> <br />His protagonist \\"Paul\\" is a retired photographer, who is living a nice and full life at the age of 60.  Due to a fantastic accident on his bicycle, he has recovered.  But he has not recovered completely.  His knee was totally shattered and his leg was amputated just above the knee.  It is as a result of this condition, that he hires a nurse. <br /> <br />Yet, we must remember that the conversations are all with Paul himself.  Whatever the characters say or do are all written by Paul.  He writes the lines.  He creates the images.  All in the book is constructed or written by Paul.  And those constructions are specifically targeted to answer a very difficult trifurcated question.  \\"What to do with the rest of my life?\\" <br /> <br />The question has 3 potential answers.  The first is to go back to his prior life as best he can, given his condition.  The second is to sit in his gloomy room till he dies a natural death, nothing ventured, nothing lost; so to speak.  The third is to choose to self-terminate and save himself the pain and anxiety.  These are the choices Paul has to select from.  There are no others.  And through this phantasmagoria, Paul investigates the inevitable question that faces all of us when we are `struck down' for the first time at some point in life. <br /> <br />The book is written with extreme aplomb and illustrates some of the deepestquestions of life.  Have I been a contributor?  Have I lived a full life?  Have I lived a righteous life?  Have I accomplished anything by which to be remembered?  All of us at some point have the opportunity to ask these questions.  Almost all of us will at some point, have this conversation with ourselves. <br />	2005-10-13

In this extraordinary rendition, Ms. Oates has created another masterpiece.  Her writing is finely honed and truly expressive to an extent not quite seen in her prior work.  She continues to progress to a highly unique and enticing writing style.  The words flow from the page to the reader in a continuous and effortless manner.  The book is arguably, the best novel she has ever penned.  But her writing style in the book is only a small part of its greatness. <br /> <br />With a special finesse, Oates captures the interesting and infinitely varied milieu of \\"Middle Age.\\"  In Middle Age people find themselves in a very different state than when they were young.  The overwhelming feeling of emptiness that is exhibited by those who reach this stage so often; resulting from the disillusionments of youth ended and the \\"empty nest\\" phenomenon that forces people to truly look at their lives; to evaluate their progress or lack thereof; to re-interpret their lives of marriage and children, now grown.  It is in middle age that people become philosophical about what has transpired in their whole prior life.  Did it represent fulfillment, or merely an empty life of going through the motions?  Do they relate to their spouses anymore, or have they grown to a point where they no longer even see each other in the same room?  In fact, do we even dislike or in the extreme even hate our spouse, our life, our children, our house, our whole worthless or non-worthless life up to that point? <br /> <br />These concepts are those that Joyce Carol Oates examines in this book.  The text examines the loves, the hates, the cruelties, the deceptions, the disillusionments and the feelings derived thereof; following the prime of life.  And then, the manner in which we interpret it.  And if we find that this life was not satisfactory, to where do we go, to what place do we run, to what satisfaction can we find in a changed environment?  Joyce takes the reader down these roads.  She describes the infidelities and the fidelities incurred in the vicissitudes of everyday life over a period of 50 years and how we see it. <br /> <br />Her characters are varied and deeply developed.  Rather than only one central character, Ms. Oates uses a small bunch of characters.  The necessity of this is unavoidable, as middle age is a condition that varies in a colossal manner from one person to another.  The book relates these almost unanswerable questions; and allows the reader to self-evaluate their own life experiences and accomplishments.  Some of us are embittered.  Some of us are grateful.  Some of us are disillusioned.  Some of us are suicidal.  Some of us are not sure what we are as we have not contemplated it in this way, this philosophical approach to the sum of our acts and deeds are what middle aged people tend to dissect.  And through that process of dissection and analysis, people then determine what will be the rest of their life's course.  Should they continue as they have?  Should they chuck it all and run away?  Should they accept with grace and dignity what has been?  Or should they start anew, if that be possible? <br /> <br />Using all her skills and perfected psychological orientation, Ms. Oates gives us a novel that rivals any produced by her literary mentor, D. H. Lawrence.  The internal analysis and depiction of the characters mental monologues and motivations are cause to bring one to a point of serious reflection.  In essence, Ms. Oates creates a classic piece of fiction that is virtually timeless.  All people either reach this point, or have become deceased before achieving it.  But whatever be the case, the book is one that should not be overlooked by any serious reader of modern fiction.  The book is in a word, truly a classic. <br />	2005-10-05

Not surprisingly, her theoretical ethics comes up against real world situations where ethics have to be modified to suit the situation.  In the book, such things as older women marrying younger men is covered, along with a host of other ethical issues; which in isolation seem relatively easy to work out, but in combination with real life events, need a bit of adjusting. <br /> <br />Additionally interesting in this story is that his detective makes a huge error.  She in fact finds herself chasing her own ethical tail, as she goes off on a hunt for the completely wrong person.  The book makes it clear to readers, that things can go wrong; people can make false assumptions; assumptions that lead one to actions that are totally unjustified. <br /> <br />With wonderful command of the scene and setting, this book is one of McCall Smith's greatest creations.  It allows the reader to apply his/her own set of ethics to the various situations.  It allows the reader to attempt to figure out which ethical positions work for them, and what they would do in the same situation. <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended for all readers of McCall Smith.  It should not be passed up, as it is one of the most transitional and interesting books in his recent publications. <br />	2005-09-28

And this novella is perhaps one of his grandest works.  It served as the backbone of the plot of \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"  This epic Oliver Stone movie about Viet Nam was fully adapted from Conrad's tale.   <br /> <br />The book is highly autobiographical.  Conrad was a river boat captain in the Congo during the time that the area was being highly exploited for its Ivory.  He observed cruelties and horrors that were not fully comprehendible by modern man.  He endured sickness and hardship; which ultimately destroyed his health to the point that he had to give up his river runs in the Congo.  But his memories and his hatred of what he saw was intact.   <br /> <br />In Heart of Darkness Conrad describes a man who has looked deeply into his soul.  This deep introspection and understanding into the deepest depths of human depravity had been seen by Mr. Kurtz.  He had looked at them with eyes wide open and integrated the most horrible of humanity into his experience.  The book drips with references to death.  Yet the references are not superfluous.   <br /> <br />The book shows the horror of the exploitation of the Europeans.  They did all and more than the Americans did in the era of slavery.  The cruelest of cruelty.  The most abominable conditions.  The death and destruction.  All of it was present in the Congo as well.  And Conrad saw it, up close and personal. <br /> <br />The book is truly a classic.  It is nice to have a hard cover edition around.  It is recommended to all serious readers of English and American literature. <br />	2005-09-22

Her focus in this book is trauma, from the most personal and emotional to the most global, i.e. The World Trade Center Disaster.  Her elucidation of the psychological is center stage in all of her stories.  Each story depicting a truly personal trauma, the book takes the reader through the pain and effects of the death of parents, the influence of serious mental illness, the difficult love and emotional interactions of a student who is seduced by a teacher and many other topics that reflect what we have seen going on in the American Society in the last decade. <br /> <br />Always, there is the ever present hardscrabble existence of those in the Upstate New York environment, the struggle to make a living, and the struggle just to live with the prevailing conditions of the region.  The struggle to live and live with one's own thoughts and experiences is truly brought to the surface. <br /> <br />From a writing standpoint this book finds Joyce at the apex of her short story writing career.  The stories are carefully crafted, with the use of multiple literary techniques.  Her use of phrases to highlight and illustrate specific intensities of thought and feeling are wonderfully blended with a writing style that grips the reader like a pipe wrench.  The reader is drawn into the lives of the characters time after time.  Her stories do not always resolve, leaving the reader to extrapolate the future of the characters.  The pictures she paints with her words are explicit and the most intense examples of human reality.  This reality is mixed most explicitly with the internal feeling of most of the characters that they are unique and that they are \\"No One You Know.\\" <br /> <br />The book is recommended for all serious readers of modern literature.  It is a classic in all respects.  Do not miss this opportunity to read some of the best short stories ever put in one book. <br />	2005-09-10
US	52846971	R3GS7BLKKN6NMT	0375713271	225791427	After the Quake: Stories	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	"Living And Dying Are, In A Sense, Of Equal Value"	Murakami has a particular expertise in describing people's feelings, perceptions and needs.  This book is no exception.  In a series of 6 short stories, Murakami presents a panoply of effects resulting from the earthquake in Kobe, Japan.  None of the stories concentrate on the actual earthquake itself.  Rather, the stories concentrate on the effects on the people who were not in Kobe, but who suffered, primarily emotionally, as a result of that disaster. <br /> <br />In America, there is a similarity between the Kobe earthquake and the 9/11 World Trade Center attack.  In both the Kobe quake and the 9/11 incident, people who were not directly affected were in fact shell-shocked by the occurrence.  In this book, Murakami shows us that the effect is universal.  His characters were all affected by the disaster, even though they were not in it. <br /> <br />The book concentrates on the psychological musings on life of Japanese people with augmentation regarding the manner in which the earthquake left a mark on their psyche.  Yet the concentration is more on the day to day life decisions that the characters make, and why. <br /> <br />Two of Murakami's stories are allegorical.  In the story, \\"Super-Frog Saves Tokyo\\" the author tells a tale about a giant frog that teams up with one person to save Tokyo from the attack of the devastating \\"worm.\\"  The frog indicates that what he needs is the man's support and belief.  The frog does all the fighting, but without others with true belief, the frog knows he cannot win.   <br /> <br />The depth of understanding of internal psychological musings is explicitly expressed by Murakami.  His character development is his forte.  His writing style is highly understandable, yet brilliantly structured.  The book is recommended for all lovers of supreme contemporary literature.   <br />	2005-09-02
US	52846971	R3ERPWDFOUTFYB	0060915439	501126556	Holy the Firm	Books	5	28	31	N	Y	What Is God Anyway?	Annie Dillard has a special way of speaking to her readers.  Her language is light and airy, yet filled with great significance and meaning.  She blithely covers the most difficult and complicated of human subjects, with terrific contemplation.  And what she yields is a treasure, a gem to be internalized and imbued. <br /> <br />In this book, Annie discusses God.  She is confused by the way in which random events that hurt and injure seem to be disconnected with the way in which we would like to live.  If these random and terrible events take place, without willful malice; then how could it happen that God would let such terrible things occur? <br /> <br />She describes a day in her life.  In that day there is a young girl visiting, to whom she is attracted and vice versa.  They have a chemistry that brings them within each other's spheres.  This beautiful girl becomes the casualty of an airplane crash.  No one else is hurt.  No one is dead.  But this girl for a random reason, is hit with a globule of flaming kerosene, and her face is totally burned away. <br /> <br />This anomaly is the framework of the book.  She could have chosen 1000 other examples that set up this question.  But she chose this one of the girl, one that could be personal not just to her; but also to her readers.  She reminds us that there is no everyday, omnipresent God directing things.  And there is no way to figure out these random events.  There are only DAYS.  And those days are filled with things that we do or don't do.  There is no God that will directly intervene and tell us what to do, or save us.  He is as ruthless as he is merciful.  His form, however, is quite another story.  His form is spiritual, not worldly, and not mundane.  And we must remember that we control most of the things in our lives directly.  We need to assume that responsibility and leave the spiritual to whatever it is we seem to believe in as God. <br /> <br />This book creates highly complex philosophical problems;which have no direct answers.  Yet the book is highly recommended for critical thinkers.  The book is a special treatment on the concept of the Divine.   <br />	2005-08-30

The book outlines the life of a boy who knows he is really a girl in a boy's body.  He is a Transgender.  And to be even more poignant, the story is told from the perspective of his sister, who is 2 years younger. <br /> <br />Julie Anne Peters goes to just the right lengths to accurately describe both the emotional and environmental situations.  Some of her most eloquent statements are made with regard to the manner in which Liam/Luna's transmogrification, transition, metamorphosis affects those around him/her as much as it affects him/her and sometimes even more.  The one who truly empathizes and suffers the pain almost as much as Liam/Luna is his sister Regan.  She is Liam/Luna's confidant, his/her enabler, and his/her instrument to the realization of his dream.  Despite all this good, Regan suffers most terribly with the knowledge of her brother's suffering. <br /> <br />The writing technique that the author uses is particularly fascinating.  She does some most effective flashback sequences that are truly artistic.  In addition, she is quite adept at writing the text and the subtext (what is going on in the character's mind and how it differs from what comes out of their mouth) that her paragraphs are like little sparkling emeralds in a field of rock and dirt.   <br /> <br />In addition, the story moves along well.  The reader has no time to get bored or complacent.  And the messages departed along the way show all too well, how society makes life very difficult; not just for the normal, but also for the extremes, and not in any rational proportion.  Just as life plays itself out; sometimes advantageously, but more of the time, unfairly.  As we all know, life is not FAIR, but sometimes we surely wish it were. <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended for all people interested in cross gender relations and in the phenomenon of Transexuality.  It does a good job explaining the difference between transsexuals and homosexuals.  And it does it in a manner that is very intimate and not objectionable.  It truly is a mirror on today's society and should be viewed as such.  <br />	2005-08-29

Much of the book is devoted to the internal musings and thoughts of Detective John Cardinal and his partner Detective Delorme.  The partners are working a 17 year old murder case, and the interaction with the people related to the case is vital and very intricate. <br /> <br />Blunt weaves a complicated tale of connections that typifies normal excellent police work.  On the way, there is some \\"high jingo\\" (higher up manipulation) of the evidence and the information.  In addition, the book concentrates on interagency cooperation in Canada.  Since the victim is American, the investigation falls in the province of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but the lead investigators on the case are local police Cardinal and Delorme. <br /> <br />As the reader moves through the book, slowly the information unfolds.  One of the beauties of this book is that the connections and information are so complex, that it is virtually impossible to guess the most likely suspect.  Blunt is masterful in creating characters for the reader to ponder, and always with good character development. <br /> <br />In short, Blunt is one of the finest detective mystery writers today.  All those interested in the genre should read this book.   <br />	2005-08-25

The characters are realistic and the story is multi-faceted.  The book centers around the return of Detective Harry Bosch and his involvement in the \\"unsolved\\" cases of the city of Los Angeles.   <br /> <br />Bosch and his partner Rider team up again to try to solve a 17 year old case.  With significantly intricate Police work, aided by a DNA match that points them toward the murder, but not directly at the murder works well in the book. <br /> <br />One item that seems a bit redundant in the book is the use of the victim's name \\"Verloren.\\"  Transparently, directly translated from the German the name means \\"Lost\\" or \\"Wasted.\\"  While it certainly is applicable, it appears in the text about 700 times and becomes just a little too omnipresent. <br /> <br />The story is captivating and interesting.  It is in the vein of the very good detective writers of today, and even yesterday.  All readers of the Detective Genre would find this book interesting.	2005-08-22

His objective is to introduce \\"Models\\" or \\"Maps\\" if you will, that help the mediator analyze specifically: <br /> <br />1) Diagnosis of the Conflict <br />2) Strategic Guidance for the Practitioner of a Course of  Action To Move Toward Resolution <br /> <br />Furlong is quick to say, \\"There is no magic formula that resolves all disputes.\\"  This statement surely gives him an element of immediate credibility.  In addition, the author notes that in his study of many 40 Hour Basic Mediation Courses, \\"Mediation training seems to be focused solely on face-to-face skills and simple steps for conducting the mediation itself, and does little to teach the participants about diagnosing the root cause of the conflict.\\" <br /> <br />In order to overcome the deficiencies of most training programs, he suggests that actual diagnostic models can be used to help the mediator \\"diagnose\\" and then \\"determine next course of action\\" using these `roadmaps to resolution.' if you will.  He defines 8 (eight) different models in his book, which he describes thusly: <br /> <br />1) The Circle Of Conflict <br />2) The Triangle Of Satisfaction <br />3) The Boundary Model <br />4) Interests/Rights/Power Model <br />5) The Dynamics Of Trust <br />6) The Dimension Model <br />7) The Social Style Model <br />8) Moving Beyond Conflict <br /> <br />To illustrate these \\"Models\\" Furlong uses a general case study, which he applies each model too, to illustrate how different \\"lenses\\" or perspectives on mediation method can yield very similar results.  In addition, it is interesting to see how certain models, which the mediator may have felt have little productive or predictive value, can in fact be the most precise \\"Models\\" to use for `Diagnosis and Treatment.' <br /> <br />These models will be recognizable to many of us who have studied the theory of conflict resolution.  For example the social style model is helpful in identifying the type of personalities of the parties in the conflict and uses the classification system with only 4 basic personality types:  Analytical, Driving, Amiable and Expressive.  This is a helpful way for a newer mediator to understand the character and personality of the parties. <br /> <br />The author is the first to present practical methods distilled from Conflict Theory that are designed to help mediators flesh out the areas that need to be worked on in order to attempt to get resolution on the conflict.  The book represents a true paradigm shift in the manner in which theory is put into practice.  All serious conflict resolution professionals should read this book. <br />	2005-08-16

She is in fact the star of the house.  She has an ability to auction like very few others.  And as this is the case, when the auction house decides to sell to a French investor, her continued employment is a significant issue in that purchase. <br /> <br />But as usual, Butler takes on the role of a female character for his protagonist.  In this impressive and interesting stream of consciousness presentation Butler reveals the innermost mental meanderings of a lady who is in a wonderful position in life, all she has to do is figure out who she wants to marry. <br /> <br />As an auctioneer, she is obsessed with collectors and valuation.  This predilection would be most natural for a person who does such activity every day of her life.  But what she had not thought much about is that people can also be collectors of people and memories.  In a sense, all people are collectors of memories.  And this concept is highly relevant to her when she is making certain life-impacting decisions. <br /> <br />Truly a fine modern novel, it is recommended to all those who are interested in the inner workings of the female mind, as Butler sees it.  Since this is often his authorial position and since he has some incredible insight into the workings of the human mind, his book comes as no surprise. <br /> <br />The book is recommended for all readers of classic literature, particularly those interested in gender analysis.  Once again, this book is a fine offering from Mr. Olen Butler. <br />	2005-08-16

He has multiple characteristics embedded in his writing that make him one of the very best mystery writers ever.  His articulation is excellent.  His vocabulary is a few levels up from the usual 8th grade vocabulary used, even by many of the masters.  And, perhaps the most interesting technique of all is the \\"architecture\\" of the book.  The use of small and fast reading chapters; the elegance and depth of character development; the complexity of the crimes and the intricacy of finding the one who was responsible; all combine to make this book a very fine work of Murder/Mystery Authorship. <br /> <br />The book is very much centered around the use of Santeria, a Cuban form of Voodoo, but with particularly nasty methods.  This version of voodoo believes that one can kill animals, and even human beings and make their spirits do work for you; gather information for you; etc.  But in order to make those spirits do their work for you, the sacrifice must be done in the right phase of the moon, and the victim must be horribly tortured to death, while mutilated so that all blood runs out of the body.  This is the scene that Officer Cardinal and his partner Officer Delorme are dealing with in this story.   <br /> <br />The detail, at just the right level is particularly well developed by Blunt in this story.  He has a knack of being able to write about a horrifying crime scene just to the right limit, where only the characters actually get nauseous; but not quite the reader.  His ability to describe the relevant details of a scene is glorious and his sentences are not over-modified with excessive adjectives and adverbs to create the illusion of literary style.  Blunt actually has literary style, which is one of the things that make this book so attractive and interesting to read. <br /> <br />The climax is very much climactic.  And the development of the story, especially from the reader's perspective is superb.  This book is very highly recommended for all readers of the Murder/Mystery Genre, and for any reader looking for a page turning experience that is on the edge of actual classic literature. <br />	2005-08-14

Freedom of religion!  The right is protected, but for one young man it is not being honored. <br /> <br />As an atheist, the protagonist holds the view that all religion was \\"all made up.\\"  So, he decides to invent his own.  It does not matter that the object of their religious fervor is a water tower.  It is specifically chosen because it is so unGodlike. <br /> <br />Yet, the story develops as all religious stories develop; with a concept, and a following.  Jason does build a small following for his religion, yet it gets him virtually nothing but trouble.  Yet he insists on going forward, despite the pressure from those who are not interested in his creation of a new religion. <br /> <br />Perhaps one of the most interesting characters of all is Shin.  Shin, a close friend of Jason, becomes enamoured with the religion to the point that he starts writing a gospel of the religion.  He actually hears the water tower speak to him and has recorded it.  He has many, many pages of the gospel of the new religion transcribed, as he says, the \\"Tower speaks to me, I hear it inside my head.\\" <br /> <br />Yet through all the troubles and travails, there is a persistence that Jason displays and in his mind; and the minds of most of his followers, he has prevailed.  Even if it has to be sub rosa, as those around do not accept even the discussion of the topic, it is still his rite.  He is still entitled to do it, in America. <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended for all people over the age of 13.  It is especially illustrative of a phenomenon repeated all over the world many times.  The book cites Joseph Smith's Church of Latter Day Saints and L. Ron Hubbard's Church of Scientology, but does not dwell at all on their philosophies, just mentions them as new religions.  And in how many places aside from America, are citizens free to do this?  Not many at all.	2005-08-12

Recognized with the Prinz Award for Young Adult Literature and a Newberry Honor Book, the story is not only engaging and serious, but also extremely well written. <br /> <br />The story revolves around a friendship relationship between a white boy and a black girl.  The white boy has never talked to a black person before, but he recognized some very special qualities in Lizzie Bright and they befriend each other.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the boy was the new Minister's son, and in this setting in Maine, there was not much tolerance for the interaction of blacks and whites.  In fact, the white attitude in the village is such that it reaches levels of pure prejudice and hurtful actions to many in the town, not just to blacks. <br /> <br />The story is truly wondrous in its use of the landscape and its incisive look inside the minds of two young people trying to deal with a prejudice they really do not understand.

She focuses on several themes in the book quite specifically, and with good effect. <br /> <br />The prevailing themes are the basic anti-semetism of the time (copyright 1925, which Cather finds inappropriate; the manner in which people \\"Masquerade\\" as something that is very different from who they are; the meaning of human life; and why that meaning is so elusive. <br /> <br />With the unavoidable use of the name GODfrey St. Peter as her protaganist, the relationship to spiritual and heavenly things is immediately illustrated.  Many of her sentences therefore start as such; \\"St. Peter thought ...\\"  This device allows her to immediately integrate religious consideration at any point within the narrative. <br /> <br />While some of the descriptive information is a bit long winded, it also must be taken into consideraton that this was 1925, and most people had never seen the types of things she is describing in her book, from a geographic and geological perspective.   <br /> <br />The story is recommended for all people who like tales of the plains and the West.  In addition, it is recommended for all readers who wish to see how an author can create the thoughts and use them effectively of her characters in her story.	2005-08-07

When Foer says, \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" he really means everything.  All the loves and hates; all the lies and truths; all the fidelities and adulteries; all the deceits and deceptions; all the horrors and the ghosts; all the atrocities and the kindnesses, all these things, Foer illuminates for the reader. <br /> <br />The premise of the book is that Foer's family was originally from a small town in Galicia, an area of Europe that was sometimes Poland and sometimes Austria and sometimes the Ukraine, depending on what year and who dominated the local geo-political scene at the time.  Foer goes back to try and find the one person that saved his father's life. <br /> <br />In the process, some very bizarre coincidences happen, the kind that only happen in the sadness of the truth of real life.  And these horrible things, these haunting memories; are the things that Foer illuminates for the reader.  This story is the one that unwinds like a snaky river running through a \\"Heart Of Darkness.\\" <br /> <br />And this is only the beginning.  Foer uses one of the most unique literary styles in this book I have ever seen.  He uses punctuation, cultural difference, ethnic strife, word combinations without punctuation; to make his point even clearer, and even more dramatic.  The book is itself a work of art as well as literature. <br /> <br />I cannot think of a reader that would not benefit from reading this book.  Its impact cannot be underestimated.  And it shall stand as one of the great creations of literature in the 21st Century. <br />	2005-08-05

His thesis is that birds are in fact the evolutionary descendants of `Feathered Dinosaurs.'  This concept was controversial although generally accepted for the past 50 years; yet there was no good paleontological evidence to support the theory.  However, Dr. Norell and his colleagues both in America and in China and in several other places around the world have now shown that there is paleontological evidence for feathered dinosaurs. <br /> <br />Dr. Norell, \\"Curator, Division of Paleontology, American Museum of Natural History\\" has found with his colleagues a paleontological site in NorthEast China known as the \\"Liaoning\\" region, specifically the \\"Jehol Biota.\\"  This particular area has incredible fossil records of the Jurassic Period (between about 110 million and 145 million years old).  These fossil records clearly show, in beautifully reproduced photographs by Mick Ellison, that clearly both feathered and hairy dinosaurs existed in that period.  And additionally, his research indicates that it is almost incontrovertible that feathers and hair were an evolutionary advantage which helped the organism contain body heat.  This starts to lead into the topic of actual transition from cold to warm blooded animals. <br /> <br />In addition to the science, the book is a wonderful and close up cultural study of China.  While China is the next pre-eminent modern society to emerge in our days, their ways and patterns of thought in many ways differ widely from Western thought.  In addition, even within China itself, there are differences in behavior and world perspective that are hot issues all over China.  The book beautifully describes these cultural aspects in both words and pictures and starts to introduce a very interesting potential humanitarian benefit. <br /> <br />As China develops, competition and friction will inevitably evolve between the political components of the United States and China.However, the collegiality of the scientific community, may be one of the most important connections that the United States can maintain with China for mutual benefit.  In this manner, perhaps there will be some level of harmony and understanding transmitted on both sides of the ocean. <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in the development of dinosaurs, specifically as it relates to them being the ancestors of birds.  The author's style is highly inviting, and it reads like a very personal story, rather than as a scientific tome.  It is a truly excellent piece of work. <br />	2005-07-27

Hazzard has a special talent for combining words on a page.  This talent is truly and uniquely illustrated here.  Her similes and metaphors, her adjectives and adverbs, her incisive psychological look at the characters inner thought processes and pattern are all here beautifully put together. <br /> <br />In this wonderful novel, Hazzard follows the love life, non-love life, adultery and non-adultery to illustrate the depth of human emotion.  Using world traveling characters, the book takes place all over the world, but mostly in England and the United States.  Hazzard is at her finest in some of her descriptive narrative about people's appearances and the physical realities, both beautiful and ugly, in the world about her characters. <br /> <br />With painstaking excellence, the lives of the two girls are illustrated.  There marriages; various deceits and betrayals; various divorces and continuations, the pace and thoughts of the ladies' encounters and interactions are elucidated.  Hazzard makes these two ladies a huge metaphor for love and dislove.  And yet, her focus surely is on love.  The many forms it takes are sketched out by Hazzard like a Renoir.   <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended for those looking to read great Modern Literature.  Hazzard starts to reach her peak in this book, and only exceeds it in her most recent novel, \\"The Great Fire.\\"  Those who wish to understand just a little better the phases of women's changing emotional patterns would be most enlightened by this work. <br />	2005-07-22

She writes a work of terrific narration, with extraordinary language as is her specialty, yet it has a very different feel to it than most of her work.  It has a spiritual feel, where she does not give us the same level of clarity and conciseness of description.  Instead, she rather allows events to unfold almost by chance.  The style is reminiscent of that of Philip Roth and in fact, it was interesting to find on the dedication page the simple words, \\"To Philip Roth.\\"   <br /> <br />Ozick's protagonist, Lars, is a book reviewer for a Stockholm newspaper.  He has a penchant for old European literature, particularly Czech, Polish and Serbo-Croatian authors.  He lives in a spiritual world of existentialism and extremis of the human condition.  Yet, the obsession if you will, is much more, because Lars, an orphan, has decided or convinced himself that he is the son of a famous and dead Polish author. <br /> <br />The plot and concepts swirl around the reader as Lars seeks to find a lost manuscript and any other information that he can about the author.  Lars is a creature of the night.  He does not like the hustle and bustle of the office during daytime hours.  He is a completely private person, and keeps his secret very close to his vest, except for his disclosure to the proprietor of a small but esoteric book shop.  With her, he tells all.  And she is fully drawn into it.  At least, that is what it clearly seems to Lars. <br /> <br />But Lars is too personally caught up in his own thing to really detect the deceit.  Lars is blinded by a vision of what he believes is his own father's eye, which comes to him in dreams.  So he continues to work with the lady at the bookstore to get all that he can about his `father.'  Until, one day a person shows up, with the lost manuscript, claiming to be the daughter of the famous Polish author.  At some point in that occurrence, Lars realizes, his confidence has been preyed on byothers. <br /> <br />Lars' reviews do not carry a lot of stock with the public.  The old and gone literature that he tries constantly to \\"resurrect\\" is of little interest to the Stockholm public.  Yet Lars is fixated on all that is written around and about the time of his father's existence.  In the end, Lars finds prominence and success, by giving up his obsession and writing well received reviews of current Swedish and American authors.  All of a sudden he has his own cubicle.  Then Lars gets a newspaper column on Tuesday as well as Monday.  And finally, he has totally conformed to the daytime world of the wild \\"stewpot\\" that constitutes the daylight work world.  But still, Lars is left with the questions of his past.  These are never fully resolved. <br /> <br />The book is recommended to all lovers of great current literature.  The writing is phenomenal.  And the story is highly interesting and engaging. <br />	2005-07-14

The story basically entails a young girl who is sent over to England to be out of her parent's way.  But shortly after she gets there and gets to know her cousins, a war breaks out. <br /> <br />The book relates the trials and travails of wartime life.  But that is just the basic story.  What makes the book particularly special is Rosoff's articulation.  Her story is clear and concise.  And the sensitivity that is packed into a very short period of time/life abounds within the book.  Daisy, the protagonist falls in love with her first cousin.  The manner in which this interaction is described is nothing short of precious. <br /> <br />The book uniquely weaves a story of intense love and excruciating war conditions that are virtually spellbinding on the reader.  Using a truly excellent stylistic technique, Rosoff also adds realism to the story by never using any obscenity in the book, but by referencing directly incidents of profanity and pornography that certainly would accompany any army.  But above all, it is the clarity of presentation that makes this book a classic contribution to the young adult literature of the 21st Century. <br /> <br />The book is recommended highly for mid to late teenagers.  In addition, it is a book with a level of compassion and feeling that would stir any reader.  Truly a great book, it is recommended for all readers over the age of 13. <br />	2005-07-11

In the first instance, it should be pointed out that a German professor of Romance languages is almost surreal in itself.  The Romance languages, the ones based on Latin such as Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Rumanian, etc. have no relationship to German at all.  In fact, English is really the combination of German and Latin. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the good Doctor still exists.  And in this adventure, we see a story in 2 parts.  The first part describes the Professor's 4 month visit to Cambridge.  Smith focuses on the differences between manners, mannerisms, modes of speaking and other idiosyncrasies about England and Germany in relating his story of the Professor's stay at Cambridge. <br /> <br />The second part gets even more interesting as the Professor finally gets the recognition he feels he deserves.  In fact perhaps he gets just a little more recognition than he bargained for when he is taken prisoner by Columbian Guerilla Fighters in the midst of a revolution.  At this point, Smith moves into the dream state of a story unfolding without the protagonist having any control over the outcome.  Yet the outcome is indeed a grand one. <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended to Alexander McCall Smith enthusiasts.  It is also recommended to those who wish to see how academicians sometimes interact with the real world in a very strange manner. <br />	2005-07-06

Hillary Rodham Clinton has been a political animal her entire life.  She spent most of her married life with Bill in the Governor's mansion in Arkansas.  Then, in the mid-1980's Bill started to consider a run for the Presidency in 1988.  Hillary talked him out of that, and into waiting to 1992. <br /> <br />The thrust of Klein's book is bifurcated.  Firstly, he tries to show the reader that a person such as Hillary Clinton, who is so aware and so involved, could not possibly have been unaware of her husband's penchant for philandering.  In fact, there is specific commentary by Klein and those he interviewed, that Hillary was aware of the former President's nature even before she married him.  Therefore, because of her network of informants, she was kept well abreast of every single potential encounter that the President might be having and was having.  She was the one who was the very LEAST surprised by the revelations of the Monica Lewinski affair; as she had been well aware of it for over 18 months. <br /> <br />Klein's second point is that Hillary is the ultimate \\"ice woman\\" of American politics.  She has brilliant advisors, some of them with a bit of a shady past, and she herself is brilliant.  She has \\"star quality\\" in a field of people that usually are not known for such Hollywood type comparisons.  And yet, through observation, one can see how Hillary has \\"re-invented\\" her image multiple times.  One can see, she has in fact blatantly lied when the conditions were to her advantage to do so.  This lying is no stranger to politicians, but in Hillary's case, it has created a personality that no one really knows.  All we know is her faade; the carefully crafted image that she is presenting to the public at any particular point in time.  But one can be sure, that every thing about Hillary is tailored to benefit one person more thanany other:  Hillary! <br /> <br />Interestingly, Klein indicates that she is surely the front runner for the Democratic Nomination in 2008.  The only question is, \\"Who is the real Hillary?\\"  This book is highly recommended for those who follow American politics.  It is truly a well written and interesting look at a major political figure. <br />	2005-07-02

This result is because the story was written as a serialized story in \\"The Scotsman\\" a daily newspaper. <br /> <br />Each chapter is about the same size, the size of a normal 2 columns in a newspaper, and Smith recognizes, that when writing a serialized story, there is a slight difference in method that must be applied.  Since there is only one day's worth of material in each segment, McCall realizes that he must make something happen in terms of plot development in every segment. <br /> <br />He does this with great aplomb.  And while Smith indicates that he is illustrating typical Scotland Archetypal personalities, it often seems to the reader, that the personalities are familiar.  In fact, the personality types McCall Smith finds in Scotland seem the same as those in London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles or Tokyo.  Personality types seem to be as universal as good and evil. <br /> <br />Once more, Smith creates a story that will capture the imagination, and keep the reader interested.  This book is recommended for all readers of McCall Smith and any person who has ever been to or has an interest in going to Edinburgh, Scotland. <br />	2005-06-30

The story is about a Japanese family trying to assimilate into American Society.  Most of the book takes place in a small town in Georgia.  There are only 36 Japanese people in the whole town.  All of them work at the chicken hatchery. <br /> <br />The book is narrated by a young girl of about 10 through 13.  She tells innocently, yet with realization, the truths about the prejudice that she encounters, and that her family encounters.  In the course of the tale, the deepest and most intimate feelings and concerns are expressed.  The feelings of Katie, the protagonist with respect to her sister Lynnie are particularly precious.  Lynnie had lymphoma and was slowly dying.  Katie reacts to this mostly in a very good way.  But occasionally, she slips in her own eyes in terms if her personal ethics and morality. <br /> <br />While many books have been written about oppressed minorities, in America, we usually don't consider Orientals as an oppressed minority.  Yet even in America today, we surely have plenty of xenophobia and prejudice.  The story goes around and around in America; over and over and over again. <br /> <br />This book is recommended for all those readers who wish to have a truly personal experience in terms of American integration.  This book is a very fine offering. <br />	2005-06-16

The author takes us inside of a `boarding school' for clones that have been bred to contribute organs to save the lives of regular people.  The apparent approximate lifespan of these clones is about 25 to 30 years.  The clones are bred and kept in various government facilities where they are taught the things they need to know to work as `care givers' for several years, before being tapped to give their organs to others to save lives. <br /> <br />These clones are sterile.  And what Ishiguro does is to capture the intellectual development of one particular clone, Kathy, and those around her in the `breeding/boarding school' that she attends.  The treatment of the subject area is very intricate and subtle.  The morality of the process itself is touched on, and touched on with disdain, but not in a way so as to suggest that such a practice can be changed. <br /> <br />The practice, however, is akin to raising cattle for food.  Yet here, we are raising human beings for slaves and organ donations.  And in their short lifespan of 30 years, they go through an entire emotional development that is significantly different from what a real person would go through.  Because they know they are to shortly die. <br /> <br />Ishiguro leaves most of the ethics and morality to the reader to puzzle out.  What he illustrates is the mindset, the psychological processes of those who are the clones.  How they cope with their 'position in life' so to speak is the focus of Ishiguro's book.  The process is developed with intensely emotional treatment and highly adept intellectual introspection.  The book is recommended to all readers interested in the ethics and morality of society and how it may develop in the future. <br />	2005-06-14

His writing style is incomparable as always.  And his juxtaposition of Whitman's lines connect the 3 versions of his story through the book. <br /> <br />Cunningham's main character is Simon.  But Simon is different as a character in each of the renditions.  The primary factor between the renditions is temporal.  The three renditions take place at different times in history.  The first takes place around 1856 to 1859 as best as it is revealed in the book.  However, since Whitman first published \\"Leaves Of Grass\\" in 1855, it had to be after that.   <br /> <br />The second rendition is circa 2005.  But the names of the characters are the same, and certain things from the first rendition carry to the 2nd.  But the main sustaining thread between the stories remains Whitman.  In the first story, Whitman even appears briefly as a character.  In the 2nd and 3rd, he is prominent as a philosophy. <br /> <br />Most of all, Cunningham seems to be trying to say that Whitman is not only timeless but universal.  In his 3rd rendition, Simon is a \\"simulo\\" a titanium frame with a human body.  His traveling companion is an \\"alien.\\"  This alien is from a different planet, about 10 to 17 lightyears away, but it is a metaphoric concept.  Cunningham uses a real alien to represent an `Illegal Alien\\" and all other minority groups in this country.  He uses it to show prejudice and xenophobia which both seem, to one extent or another, as Universal as Whitman.  Yet Whitman would not have rejected this concept.  Whitman rejected nothing, he only accepted and loved.  Cunningham takes us just one step further to the understanding of Whitman's concept of universality and love of all.  We can all be found in the Leaves Of Grass in the end. <br /> <br />The book is recommended for all readers of great literary fiction.  Cunningham truly has a gift for writing.  Do not miss thisopportunity to experience it. <br />	2005-06-11

The Professor is the protagonist of all these books, as Precious Ramotswe is the protagonist in all the \\"No. 1 Ladies Detective\\" Series books.  But Professor Dr. von Igelfeld is quite a different character all together. <br /> <br />A professor of Romance Philology, Dr. von Igelfeld sees himself as a great academician in the present day world.  Yet his field is so narrow and so esoteric, that there are few who really have interest in it.  Yet, the good Dr. writes the definitive book on Portuguese Irregular Verbs, and thereby; has earned a place in immortal history: or so he would see it. <br /> <br />The book is extremely amusing and entertaining as McCall Smith takes us through the ill fated travails of the Good Professor Dr. von Igelfeld.  The Dr. is always trying to do the \\"societal correct\\" thing.  Yet he often manages to botch that effort rather enormously.  Of great interest is McCall Smith's last chapter, called \\"A Death In Venice.\\"  And the chapter is a direct and unobscured reference to Thomas Mann's story of the same name.    <br /> <br />The chapter is unusual, and brings all types of questions to mind about Prof. Dr. von Igelfeld, not least of which is whether he has a personal sexual identity crisis.  Mann's story was about latent homosexuality, and that precise topic is eluded to, in a very unusual manner.  Yet, not unlike Mann's story, the allusions are very subtle. <br /> <br />The book is recommended for all McCall Smith readers.  The Series is greatly amusing and shows what can happen when people take themselves just a little bit too seriously. <br />	2005-06-03

His plot is wonderfully intricate, and his method is superb. <br /> <br />The story is told primarily through the narrative of a 9 or 10 year old boy, who has Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).  The disorder lends itself naturally to a \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" technique, as much of an ADD person's thought patterns form in a stream of consciousness, rapidly shifting from one topic to another.  Yet Foer works in an incredible amount of information with these initially seemingly unrelated little items. <br /> <br />Because of this technique, it does take the reader about 100 pages to start to get the handle on who is who in the story.  Nonetheless, as one goes further and further, all things are revealed.  And a tenderness and level of feeling is conveyed in a manner that is unique.  Foer makes the book not only a reading experience, but in addition a visual, artistic experience for the reader. <br /> <br />His use of graphics and pictures compliments perfectly the story itself.  His careful introspective analysis of Oskar, the protagonist, allows him to convey things that are so deep and subtle, that they are truly heart wrenching at times, and heart warming at others.  And throughout the book, the question of time, of temporal order is challenged. <br /> <br />This concept of observing time in different manners, either disjointed or just plain running backwards is the central theme of the book.  Oskar's father had died in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.  The book references that and many other disasters in human history.  But what Oskar seeks, is a real connection to his father.  And he does it in many ways, by running time backwards, so he can remember his memories of the past, particularly of his father. <br /> <br />Oskar's adventures take him to all parts of New York City and he meets all types of people.  And through this experience, he gains a unique understanding of life, even though, it is so vastly different for each person.  This experience helps Oskar put the death of his father in perspective, to the point where he is at peace with it eventually.  But his journey to that point, is highly intricate and wonderfully illustrated. <br /> <br />This book is for all readers of great contemporary literature.  The book is one of the finest of the 21st Century to date.  Do not miss the opportunity to indulge in this wonderful piece of literary work. <br />	2005-05-29

The book is wondrously readable and compels and propels the reader through its pages.  At first, the book seems a bit like a cross between \\"The Prince of Tides\\" and \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" but it reveals itself as a truly unique tale of seeking and searching for both information and understanding.<br /><br />Kidd uses a series of chapters; none of them too long.  This contributes to the readability of the book.  In addition, the use of extremely well phrased descriptive language allows a very clear picture of the surroundings which accompany the epiphanies of the characters; especially her protagonist Jessie.  Jessie is in a full blown mid-life crisis of every respect and proportion.  Her life is a life she really has dreamed about all her life, yet something is now missing.  She feels Lost and Adrift.<br /><br />A family emergency calls her away to the barrier islands of South Carolina, and this is where the story of her understanding and identity start to coalesce and resolve.  Kidd's language in the story is well put together and contains good clarity.  Her vocabulary is very modest, but well utilized to convey those feelings that must be understood.  Her best moments in the book are when she is discussing the psychological introspection of her characters, and how the facts and events affect these psychological interpretations of life and love and death.<br /><br />The book is recommended for readers who are interested in people in life transitions.  It is a picture of a life milestone that most of us go through at some point in time.  The book is highly incisive and makes the reader think about their own goals, objectives and positions in life.  It is a very well written contemporary novel.	2005-05-23

His approach to his stories is very intimate; visceral, yet incisive; evocative, and deeply psychological.  The book develops the character of the protagonist Jack with great precision and mostly through his inner mental monologue.  While Busch writes excellent dialogue, his forte is his psychological process analysis.  This skill is never more needed than in the detective and mystery genre. <br /> <br />A technique in his writing style that is somewhat new and quite inventive is his manner of transition.  In this book, a wonderful and creative segue technique is developed; whereby a touch, a sound, the smell of coffee, the handle of a shovel can take the reader from one subplot to another seamlessly, but also, without obvious breaking points.  This interesting stylistic element adds to the uniqueness and readability of the book. <br /> <br />While there is tragedy and difficulty in the story, Busch takes great pains to not be \\"careless with his characters.\\"  Each character is treated with respect and dignity, even if they do undignified things.  The development of the personalities is cautious, but precise.  And the resolutions of the plot and subplot elements are realistic, yet not gruesome or unduly painful. <br /> <br />Finally, Busch has a gift for writing love scenes.  His mix of tactile and psychological writing allows him to portray personal interaction in a manner that has great clarity.  And in addition, the scenes have portrayals that are hugely meaningful and explanatory.  This book is recommended for all readers of serious fiction with an interest in the detective/mystery genre. <br />	2005-05-20

These stories of the homeland of Africa tell of animals and trees; clear water and clear skies; harmony and spirituality: but also of ethics and morality.  It is difficult not to think about Rudyard Kipling's \\"Just So Stories\\" as the lessons learned in both sets of stories are often similar.  Yet Smith's renditions are much more at one with nature and the environment than Kipling's. <br /> <br />In this short book containing 33 distinct stories, Smith has chosen those which tell a story and a lesson in the clearest and most concise manner.  Subjects such as jealousy, beauty and selfishness are fully covered.  The lessons of courage and the despair of hubris are taught with aplomb.  The messages of deceit are well illustrated and its consequences well articulated. <br /> <br />Additionally, no subject is off bounds for McCall Smith as one of his stories casually talks about the Evolutionary development of baboons (\\"The Baboons Who Went This Way And That\\").  Clearly on a subject like that, Smith leaves it to the reader to make up their own minds.  But whatever your belief system, Smith's book is evocative.  It does ask the reader to examine himself and examine others, and compare them to the metaphoric archetypes that Smith provides a glimpse of in these stories. <br /> <br />Once again, Alexander McCall Smith creates a work that both entertains and educates.  And this one can be read to people of any age, from 1 to 110.  It is truly a marvelous collection of stories that once only traveled by word of mouth.  Any reader can enjoy this book.   <br />	2005-05-13

The aspects of the detective work are a little richer and more intricate than in prior books; which concentrated more on Ethics and Morality, than detective work.  Yet, they all had a special flare, as is typical of McCall Smith. <br /> <br />In his latest creation, he takes us further inside the seemlier side of Botswana.  Here we learn about the `shebeens' that give people credit for liquor, and then exact great price for failure to pay one's bill upon it reaching large proportions.  In addition, we see the new morality starting to hit the scene in Botswana.  A little bit of Johannesburg and other less respectful cities and countries are starting to spread into Botswana, a Democratic Wonderland in comparison to so many of its neighbors. <br /> <br />Smith uses his normal clarity in painting the scenes, many of them having not so clear moral or ethical issues.  But they are issues that human beings nonetheless must face and deal with, each in their own manner.  While all of us can imagine the usual uses of `right and wrong' there are so many times, when the lines of ethics and morality seem hazy or at the very least, have a few curves and bumps.   <br /> <br />The Alexander McCall Smith reader will not be disappointed by this new addition to the series.  Smith is crafting the characters and the stories in a more deeply dynamic cast, allowing them to rapid adaptation to rapidly changing conditions.  And, he thus allows them to take us deeper into the difficult decisions of the strange problems of life.  The book is recommended for all McCall Smith readers, and all readers seeking some answers to the ethical and moral issues which confront us daily, no matter what society we live in. <br />	2005-05-08

The book presents brilliance in a number of ways.  McEwan selects a neurosurgeon as his protagonist in this story.  With such a character, literally a `brain surgeon,' the levels of thought and introspection are unlimited.   <br /> <br />The book describes what starts out as a normal Saturday for Henry, the neurosurgeon.  Saturday is his favorite day of the week, as he usually has it all to himself.  But on this Saturday, that was not to be.   <br /> <br />In the process of telling his tale, the events of the life of Henry Perowne on a particular Saturday in England, many things happen that depart from the regular Saturday; and are revealed.  The book analyzes in great detail, the thought patterns that precede the actions of Henry.  The level of these thought patterns is clearly articulated and elucidated in the book. <br /> <br />But more than the contents, and complimentary to his story, McEwan does something that is rare for a novelist.  It is something that nags at the reader, until it dawns on him; that McEwan has actually written most of the book in \\"meter.\\"  The sentences he constructs are in an iambic style, many times, standard iambic pentameter.  Once the reader recognizes this, which finally is showcased in a related way as one of the characters is a great poet, and one is a great poet to be; the technique is nothing short of brilliant.  Thus the book is really written in \\"Blank Verse\\" enhancing the power of McEwan's words. <br /> <br />This book is recommended for all readers of excellent literature and for those interested in a unique literary style that puts the author in a class by himself. <br />	2005-04-22

US	52846971	R2MI7QPCBA8BZS	0140178139	317388917	Leviathan	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	Auster In Transition	This book is a transitional piece for Auster.  In this excellently written story about a man lost in the world after years of bohemian existence we find a wonderful work of internal psychological reasoning.  In this book, Auster makes the leap from the observer, narrator or protagonist, to the insertion of himself, as a writer/observer, into the story as a character.  The choice of the name \\"Peter Aaron\\" is a not so subtle clue that Auster means Aaron to be himself.  With both Auster and Aaron having the initials \\"P.A.\\" it is difficult to ignore Auster's presence in the story.<br /><br />The book takes us deeply into the activities of his good friend, Ben Sachs, another writer.  The book illustrates the development of the existential Sachs in a world which he is mostly powerless to control.  At some point, Sachs believes he has wrested control over his own life, and yet, just at that point, is the point that perhaps he has least control over his life; but does not realize it.<br /><br />Auster, as usual, has surrealism meet reality.  It is a talent he has developed and only gets better with practice.  And he practices it to the fullest extent here.  Auster combines his talent for surrealism with a wonderful sense of human irony.  His use of that combination often leaves the reader with a feeling that `nothing really matters; but everything really matters.'  Yet he clearly shows also, that if nothing really matters, any road will get you there.<br /><br />This book is recommended highly for all readers of Auster's work as the reader can see Auster's transition in this book.  In addition, it is recommended for all readers who wish to further examine the depth and breadth of human thought, once derailed from what we consider \\"reality.\\"	2005-03-27

In fact, unlike such stories as \\"The Story Of O\\" Roth uses his incredible talents to write a story that is as close to pornography as possible, while yet staying within the bounds of true literary genius. <br /> <br />The book is a graphic tale of a man obsessed with his own demons; but also, obsessed with sexuality.  His truly wondrous and yet obscene activities with his `girlfriend' show just what people can do, if their mind leads them to it. <br /> <br />While the story uses a female character for the scenes, the true protagonist is Sabbath, who does everything from recording obscene phone calls on sex lines, to actually urinating on his partner and vice versa.  Yet, it is not really the sexuality that Sabbath has that is the fulcrum of the story, but the way it pans out and the effect it has on others around him in the story. <br /> <br />As Roth progresses through the tale, we find that his protagonist is not only obsessed with sex, but with his own, almost perverted outlook on reality.  Ultimately, the story leaves Sabbath lost and destitute within his mind.  The story leaves the reader to puzzle out what Sabbath may do next, yet this is not important to the thrust of Roth's point.  And the beauty of Roth's book, is that he brings out into the open, the things that people do and fantasize about.  Roth has the self-assurance and courage to put all this into words, for everyone to read. <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended to people who find personal introspection a serious pursuit; and the analysis of sexuality, as a virtual way of life.  It helps all readers to examine their own sexuality and how it manifests itself within the minds of people. <br />	2005-03-13

Ozick paints an incredible graphic picture of what Miami looks like to one who has survived a stint in a Nazi concentration camp.  The story starts with a classic example of Nazi savagery, showing how the protagonist had a daughter in the camp, and how that daughter was treated with gratuitous violence and horror. <br /> <br />Ozick clearly portrays a women with a mind that has been tortured so badly, that she feels that everything is deeply negative.  The vision is of one whose eyes have been colored with blood colored glasses, and the dust and ash of burnt bodies.  The story leads the reader through this emotional and psychic horror show, that runs through the protagonist's head. <br /> <br />For a bit of additional irony, Ozick reveals the story as her character searches the city for a lost pair of underwear.  This personal item is so important to her, that she exerts more energy in the search for that, than she does in the continuation of life.  Her perspective is that the Nazi's \\"stole her life.\\"  And for so many, this was indeed the case.  Whether they survived or not, they had their lives stolen from them. <br /> <br />Through this prism Ozick reveals the way the mind is deeply and permanently affected by the exposure to a period of horror; that no human being should ever have to endure.  As a result, the experience always leaves an impression on the mind which cannot be shirked, no matter how hard a survivor tries, the memory of the ugliness and the near death conditions never completely leaves their memory or present day life. <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended for those interested in the affect that being in a concentration camp exerts on the human mind.  It also is a purely exquisite tale of human suffering. <br />	2005-03-11

He truly stretches the boundaries of fiction to just a tad short of the line between fiction and science fiction.  But clearly, it is literature, not science fiction.  Conceptually, the book is put together in a fashion where even the construction of the chapters, mimics the parallel universe and elasticity of time that the author wishes to convey. <br /> <br />He does this with extreme aplomb and high standards.  Throughout the novel there are multiple levels of thought on every subject, philosophical levels, spiritual levels, mental levels and `labyrinthine' paths to follow.  The theme of sexual identity is an extremely basic element to the book.  The way he illustrates it is artful and beautiful. <br /> <br />As implied by the title, Kafka also is a very important element of the book.  And the book borrows from Kafka in its sense of the surreal.  But much more deeply than that, is Kafka, the master of \\"irony;\\" because irony is also central to the theme of the book. <br /> <br />By using a brilliant technique of writing parallel stories that slowly move to convergence, but don't totally make it to the vanishing point, Murakami creates a very active montage effect, by alternating chapters from one story to the other; thus allowing the reader to merge them, as the author exactly so desires.  A story so intricate and so Oedipal is woven into a fine structure, fragile, but with an inner glow that is truly visceral.  The Oedipal story within the irony, sexual identity and intellectual crises of the book, just make it more fascinating to read.  Not to mention the use of Colonel Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Johnnie Walker, right off the scotch bottle, as real characters, the use of allegorical animals, and discussions with same all give the book just one more level of complexity in its wonder and emotion. <br /> <br />The book is recommended for all people who appreciate fine modern literature.  The greater your background in literature, philosophy and life experience, the more the reader can personally relate.  However, whatever level the reader is at, this book will expand the mind.  Do not miss the opportunity to read this creation.  <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-03-08

And she presents them to the reader in her own unique manner.  Her work is often experimental, but not `Bohemian' in this well crafted portrait of people and their private neurotic fears and moments.  Truly just for her fine portrayal of these psychic anomalies there is plenty of justification to purchase and read this fine book.  As a first book, it is quite well done. <br /> <br />Without revealing any plot lines it is worth noting that the following neurotic symptomologies are portrayed beautifully in her book of stories:  writer's block, fear of sharks, belief in little invisible elves in the night, fear of intimacy, hypochondria, fear of success, obsessive-compulsive behavior, alcoholism, eating disorders, paranoid behavior and promiscuity.  The list is formidable, and so are the stories. <br /> <br />The author has an extremely acute sense of being well understood and articulated in both the beginning of the story and the end of the story.  She talks about it in her first story.  And in that regard, she has truly succeeded, her stories illustrate both wonderful beginnings and truly ironic and interesting endings; while some of her middles could have been 5 to 10 pages shorter and still gotten the same message across.  Nonetheless, the book does stand out, particularly as a debut offering, as one which shows an author with a talented future. <br /> <br />Special commentary is deserved on the title story, \\"unkempt.\\"  Of all the stories in the book, this one truly just works right.  It holds the reader's attention very strongly as she moves through this very wonderful tale; which somehow has a little something in it for everyone.  This story is the cornerstone of a developing writing style that is tremendously powerful and also insightful, entertaining and deeply philosophical; yet unique to Ms. Eldridge alone.  Here she shows what she can do as the writer, when she is so in touch with her subject that she can `dance it' as well as write it.  So well, that it seems at least to be partially autobiographical; but only Courtney knows that for sure.  The book is recommended for those who like finely written contemporary fiction. <br />	2005-03-02

The book centers around the development of a sexual identity in her protagonist, Darren.  Darren is 16 going on 17 in the story, which takes place over about a 1 year time frame.  Oates is particularly specific and incisive with her psychological development of the character's sexual identity. <br /> <br />In addition, there are several powerful subplots or themes concurrently unfolding in the story.  But perhaps the most significant of these is the result of a person being falsely accused of a sexual crime.  Despite the fact that this person has passed a lie detector and there is no tangible evidence against him, neither physical nor testimonial; not even enough to show cause to arrest him.  Yet this does not stop the entire town from believing precisely the opposite of the truth.  In a most profound manner, Joyce illustrates just how the \\"appearance of impropriety\\" is just as bad as an actual impropriety. <br /> <br />Oates' writing style is particularly fascinating in this book.  It is a conflation of all her previous talents, with elements of Barthelme image fragments and D.H. Lawrence style deep psychological introversion; it also combines her prior writing styles with her Rosamund Smith (her pseudonym) style in its page turning readability.  The character of this style is very, very different; and leaves the reader to interpret much more than Oates usually does.  Yet it is also gripping and charismatic in the manner in which she uses it.  <br /> <br />This is one of the finest of her novels so far, and completes the transitional writing style, which seems to have been so prevalent, but developmental in her book \\"Rape:  A Love Story.\\"  The book is recommended for almost all readers, it is a thriller, a classic and a mystery rolled all into one.  The feelings and empathy she displays here are seriously professional.  The book is truly a bit magical. <br />	2005-02-24

He uses a news story and a postcard to introduce each of his stories.  The concept of the postcard is further refined by showing the significant difference between life as it is, and life as depicted on the postcard. <br /> <br />First and foremost, the book is about America.  Many of the characters are immigrants, coming to America for the first time.  Many are not.  But all meet the trials and tribulations of American life.  And they write a postcard to someone they know and/or love.  Yet that postcard is not in the least an accurate depiction of their life at that point in time. <br /> <br />Butler deals with the physical, the spiritual and the concepts of life and death in a visceral manner.  Some of his stories are about war.  Others are about immigration.  Still others are about the contrast between life and death.  These are the same questions that haunt all of our minds.  And through his stories, Butler gives us a perspective on all these things, in fact, a very American perspective. <br /> <br />Butler is at his very best in the short story genre.  He won his Pulitzer Prize for a terrific book of short stories.  This one is no exception.  It is highly recommended for all lovers of experimental modern literature, and those who love the short story genre, as these are some of his best. <br />	2005-02-19

Despite the early date of composition, one can clearly see her brilliance in her writing style.  Her ability to string words together in a line, on a page, makes her one of the finest articulationists in business today. <br /> <br />In particular, Ozick focuses on man's relationship to the spiritual world.  And also, the manner in which these two worlds interact with each other.  Often people seem to forget, that men and women who have a spiritual calling are also, just men and women.  In addition it is sometimes forgotten; that regular men and women, sometimes may be very spiritual. <br /> <br />But that too is a subject for Ozick in her book, the difference between men and women, or in particular, the manner in which the world reacts to them.  She examines this in interesting detail in her story \\"Virility.\\"  And within her story \\"The Doctor's Wife\\" she reveals a perfectly exquisite line \\"... that the worthlessness of everything was just what gave everything its worth\\" creates a unique perspective for the reader.  It is interesting to consider life as being worthless, particularly in an existential manner, but can one also see, this very existential worthlessness truly imparts worth, not only denigrates that which seems to have none. <br /> <br />As always, the brilliance of Ozick's compositional ability cannot be ignored.  This book is recommended for all who find beauty in the written word, when portrayed with such elegance. <br />	2005-02-16

Psalm 30	The first thing that the reader notes is the book is impossible to put down.  Mr. Rosen builds a special rapport with the reader that makes his story compelling.  The reader is left each time the book is put down, with the irresistible urge to find out what will happen next. <br /> <br />Rosen tells a wonderful and realistic tale of a Reform Woman Rabbi in Manhattan.  The book describes her relationship to the Jewish faith, from a Reform Perspective.  This perspective is a difficult one, as the concept of Reform Judaism has at its core, the same beliefs as all Judaism, but tempered by a modern interpretation of the scriptures that lends itself more easily to the combination of civil and religious life in the vast Materialistic and Capitalistic and Cacophonous reality of modern society. <br /> <br />Yet Deborah, the lady Rabbi who is the protagonist of Rosen's story, does not in any way lack spiritualism or connection to her faith.  She has a great and mighty dedication to her beliefs.  And she does her utmost to convey that feeling to her congregants and to all that she may meet.  Some would say, that she made some very rash decisions and took some very unorthodox actions within Rosen's story.  But this is for the reader to evaluate in the privacy of the mind. <br /> <br />One thing is clearly true.  The book shows the stark contrast and the interesting co-existence of human Joy and human Sadness, as they live within us, all the time, yet most of the time, they balance within us to make us a whole person.  When that balance is no longer within our control, we lose our ability to moderate that and we also lose our ability to operate in regular day to day society. <br /> <br />Rosen is acutely wonderful at illustrating this dichotomy in his book.  For all who have struggled with the concepts of the different forms of Judaism, this book offers a new perspective; a perspective that puts the power of decision and free choice back into the individual's mind and heart, andnot into anyone else's.   <br /> <br />The book is highly recommended for all with any interest whatsoever in theology and the concept of God.  Regardless of one's religion, one can related to the stark, yet gentle realism of Rosen's work. <br />	2005-02-11

The stories continue to flow seamlessly, through her whole book.  Yes, \\"stories,\\" as even though the book is a novel, it is composed of chapters, which are in fact free standing stories in and of themselves.  All the stories are narrated by her protagonist, but each story could be lifted out of the book, and be self-contained. <br /> <br />Her subject of each story is unique, and yet it is all mixed with her wondrous elucidation of the struggles, feelings and progression of the German people in `reconstruction' after the World War II.  The people left, in so many country towns of Germany, in the aftermath of the war.  These people were only trying to live; before, during and after the war.  They were not part of the political maelstrom we call National Socialism.  Their lives were very much more simple than that, and they did suffer quite terribly, yet they stoically went on, as people have proved in every corner of the globe, that this is what human beings do.  They pick up what is left and go on. <br /> <br />Hegi does not concentrate on the effects of the war, they are coincident with the life that is found in post-World War II Germany.  Hegi concentrates upon the life of her protagonist, a very smart and very sensitive young lady, from age 7 through about 14, as she grows up in this environment.  The problems that she encounters though are the normal problems that all people encounter in every environment.  Only the backdrop has to do with where they are and what the landscape is like.  Hegi pays attention to that, but not overly, it is the people that are her subject:  from Love to Death, from teenage pregnancy to sexual child abuse, from amputation to neural disease, these are the things that Hegi speaks about, and how they affect her narrator as she grows up in the midst of it.  As she grows upin life, perhaps wherever she might be. <br /> <br />Hegi writes modern day literature.  It is worthy of the classification, and will endure the test of time.  All readers who enjoy wonderfully written contemporary literature should not miss the opportunity to indulge themselves in Hegi's book. <br />	2005-02-04

In his most recent book, Alexander McCall Smith reveals some of the intrinsic characteristics of collegiate academic life.  He highlights the pomposity, arrogance and constant quest for self-recognition that characterizes the avocation.  With tremendous aplomb, McCall Smith relates the misadventures of Herr Professor Dr. Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, a professor of \\"Romance Philology.\\"  His great work of academic achievement in his lifetime is a respected book called \\"Portuguese Irregular Verbs.\\" <br /> <br />While his specialty and achievement are surely somewhat esoteric and of interest mostly to academicians, rather than regular people, the book presents multiple situations in which Dr. von Igelfeld presents his specialty to regular people.  As per the title of the book; the good `Doktor' presents a lecture on \\"Sausage Dogs\\" or as we know them better, \\"Dachshunds,\\" in an attempt to get American recognition.  Interestingly, he thought he was to speak on \\"Portuguese Irregular Verbs\\" but with a little last minute adjustment, the Professor does in fact give a lecture on \\"Sausage Dogs.\\" <br /> <br />In the book, it is the interrelation of this \\"Ivory Tower\\" mindset and the more mundane mindset of people outside this environment that McCall Smith concentrates on illustrating.  He keenly shows the reader the almost `back-biting' environment internal to academic life, and then, more specifically and graphically, shows us the way in which one of these academics relates, or fails to relate, to normal people in a world outside of academia.  As can be expected, this combination results in some extremely amusing outcomes. <br /> <br />Smith is in good form in this book, although it is not one of his best.  Nonetheless, devotees of the Alexander McCall Smith multiple scenarios and other works, will find this book quite in line with the McCall Smith they have grown to know and love. <br />	2005-01-30

One where the central government is no longer in touch with the needs of the people, where local government is unable to raise enough money to keep basic services working and where each person `fends for themselves' in the streets, where ever they can find what they need to stay alive. <br /> <br />The description is beautifully constructed and while Auster never states this, the city has a feel of Manhattan, which would not be odd, as Auster lives in NYC and is intimately familiar with the City and all its nooks and crannies.  But in this book, Auster leads the reader through the most terrible and heart rending human conditions; physical, emotional and psychological.  And the descriptions of these pains are precise and concise. <br /> <br />Auster uses his usual tremendous power with words to convey the depth of all the darkest of the dark.  But he does make a point of stating that these people are Alive!  This is not some type of \\"Hell\\" but if anything:  Purgatory!  Here on Earth! <br /> <br />With truly artful metaphor, the story of Paul Auster is clear: <br /> <br />Man will try to go on, not matter how horrible his surroundings, no matter how painful it is to continue to live; until he is just no longer able to do so. <br /> <br />The book is high quality and uniquely created modern literature.  It is an experience that all serious literary readers should not miss. <br />	2005-01-27

Ms. Truss's new book is truly a wonder and a pleasure simultaneously!  She has succeeded in writing a book about Grammar, that is actually pleasurable to read, in fact, truly delightful to read; and still includes all the grammatical essentials specific to \\"Punctuation.\\"  Ms. Truss concentrates on the use and misuse of punctuation in everyday life.   <br /> <br />Once she points out the horrific state of the English language, she goes on to state the correct rules for usage of every single punctuation mark extant in the language today; and some commentary about extinct punctuation as well.  Her prose and examples are truly amusing and educational.  And her choice of first person writing style allows her character to shine through every page. <br /> <br />She concludes by saying that some of the \\"rules\\" are in fact conventions, that are argued about continuously as the language evolves.  And to show she is hip as well, she devotes a charming final chapter to the use of `Cyberspeak' or `Netspeak,' including 'emoticons,' and some of her anticipated prognostications on the effect this will have on the evolution of language into the future. <br /> <br />This truly is a writers' book, presented with great care and precision, in such a way, that it becomes a book for all who wish to learn, as Ms. Truss would put it; \\"The correct manner in which to use an apostrophe!\\" <br />	2005-01-19
US	52846971	RAP8UOYXYWLFG	0151010404	421567525	The Double	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Through The Looking Glass With Saramago	Saramago's \\"The Double\\" is a beautifully worded and somewhat experimental novel that truly earns the title true literature.  In a masterful tale, the author immediately brings the reader into the story, by including him in most of the secrets of the book, in advance of the characters.  In several places the author speaks directly to the reader, and is ever conscious of how certain items in his rendition, and the plot twists may appear to the reader. <br /> <br />In an additional artful turn, the use of most periods and quotation marks is dispensed with, leaving the reader to mentally insert them in the appropriate places.  Periods are rare, and paragraphs are rarer.  Chapters are lengthy, but not in anyway boring, more knuckle whitening, if anything.  And the author comments to the reader on anomalies and potential paths for which the plot may proceed. <br /> <br />But at the core of the story is an identity crisis; one of the most extreme variety.  Not only does our protagonist have a problem with his own identity in a psychological manner.  He actually has a problem with his identity in a physical manner.  He discovers, virtually by accident, that he has an identical double within the same city limits as he himself lives. <br /> <br />To compound the dilemma, Saramago makes the \\"double\\" an actor.  He makes him a person who takes on the character and personality of other people, and sometimes perhaps, may not have a personality of their own.  They may in fact be identical in character; they may in fact be the same person.  If they are, is one of them superfluous?  This is the question Saramago poses.  And within it all, are the inevitable, and in fact surreal consequences of the actions that are taken by this discovery of a \\"double.\\" <br /> <br />It has been said that the act of observation changes the behavior of the observed.  In this book, Saramago makes that fact very plain to the reader.  And yet, it is something that could happen so easily to anyone, at leastseem to happen to anyone.  And something that is not easily resolvable. <br /> <br />Saramago speaks on several plains of consciousness throughout the book.  The novel is recommended for all readers who enjoy serious modern literature.  And for those who have a deep interest in the internal workings of the minds of men, and women.  One should not pass up the opportunity to read this book. <br />	2005-01-10

In the book, she explains how people can resolve conflict by using some simple and elegant techniques.  In addition, the book is written for people ages 11 to 114.  The book borrows mostly from the practice of Mediation.  Mediation is a form of conflict resolution which uses a Neutral Mediator who helps parties come to a mutually acceptable agreement to end their dispute. <br /> <br />The literature of Mediation is filled with academic treatises using legal and Sociological words which make them often difficult for a regular person to read and integrate.  Ms. Drew specifically did NOT write that type of book.  Her book teaches concepts and methods by which people can help solve problems that are meaningful to them and others. <br /> <br />In doing so, Ms. Drew uses some special writing ability and her vast experience as a recognized expert in Peer Mediation and School Conflict Resolution.  She writes her book in a vernacular using regular words to describe what she is telling the reader.  She uses ethnic names of all nationalities to convey that all people can do this type of work, and all people are worthy of respect.  She most effectively uses real life examples and information that she gathered from her work and from her survey of Middle School children all over the country.  And she reaffirms the belief that everyone is hurt by conflict and everyone can help to fix that problem in society. <br /> <br />It is rare that readers come across a book that gives this much affirmation and assistance in regular life, and is suited for virtually all people in such a vast age range.  The book is recommended for almost everyone who has an interest in helping reduce the amount of conflict in the world today.  Not just big conflicts like wars, but also regular conflicts that we face everyday as people. <br /> <br />This book is truly a fine example of how people can take their own power and help not only themselves, but those all aroundthem.  All who have the wish to reduce pain and hurtfulness in society should read this book.	2004-12-06

The book recounts a very interesting story about what Christmas means to so many.  It represents a time of hopefullness and wishes that people have and how they may come true. <br /> <br />The obvious similarity between Auster's story and O. Henry's \\"Gift of the Magi\\" involves the giving of gifts, one person to another, but not in the regular way we give gifts at Christmas.  In this book, by a simple twist of fate, Auggie Wren, the protagonist comes upon a wallet, that was dropped.  For a long time, Auggie just keeps the wallet, but eventually he attempts to give it back to its owner. <br /> <br />Upon arrival at the owner's house, it turns out, that he is not there at the time.  However, the grandmother of the wallet owner is there.  And she is blind.  Yet, she allows herself to accept the visit and perhaps the spirit of Christmas by allowing Auggie to represent her grandson, as the Grandmother to believe that he is who she wishes him to be.  Likewise, Auggie allows himself to accept a gift that is given in a very unusual manner. <br /> <br />While Auggie believes that even blind, the women knew he was not her grandson, yet she allows Auggie to act as the grandson, because that is her most personal wish at that time.  In return for this favor, the grandmother in turn gives unknowingly, a gift to Auggie.  Auggie though is bothered by the manner in which he acquired the gift and goes back to return it.  When he arrives, the Grandmother no longer is resident at the apartment. <br /> <br />What actually happens to her, Auster never reveals.  However, the concept of the story is tightly bound to the giving of gifts, one to another, and with the gifts, there is both sorrow and love.  As each gives what they have, and each sacrifices what they have, in order to please the other. <br /> <br />Such is the case in this book as well.  The book is highly recommemded for those who have a familiarity with \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" and also with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickens.  A good familiarity with those stories enhances the reader's understanding of Auster's point.   <br /> <br />Because of the books short text, it can be read in lest than 30 minutes, but it is strongly advised that the reader reread the book immediately after finishing it the first time, in order to get the full flavor and impact of Auster's version of Christmas. <br />	2004-12-04

The book presents the dilemma of a highly trained and highly intelligent and highly well read protagonist, who observes her life and presents her life philosophy, as it tangentially touches the rest of the world.  Despite this life of mostly solitude and unhappiness there is the incisive uncovering of a universality of man/woman. <br /> <br />The book discusses the cycles of life, and afterlife, through the eyes of the protagonist, Puttermesser.  Her life starts on a good footing; she makes certain decisions that are done mostly for ethical and aesthetic reasons.  The changes make her happier, sometimes, and unhappy most of the time.  Nonetheless, she perseveres.  She stumbles through life's pitfalls and works them through, both professionally and personally.  In fact, with a little help from some spiritual friends, she rises to exalted levels of power. <br /> <br />But, then the cycle changes.  Those same friends that got her to high places, conspire to ruin this achievement, and in fact are successful at destroying it.  She becomes a pariah in her own town, in her own neighborhood.  And she sadly watches as all she has accomplished comes undone. <br /> <br />At the nadir of her life, she dies.  And she does not just die, she is murdered.  But that is not where the story ends.  The story continues into Paradise, the Garden of Eden, Heaven, where she finds what she did not really expect.  In Paradise, she finds that it is only necessary for one to 'think it so,' and it is so, in Paradise.  But similarly to real life, all things must pass, and thus whatever one thinks into existence in Paradise, is also destined to disappear.  And thus, Ozick reveals, that Paradise is not only Heaven, but also Hell simultaneously:  A simulacrum of life. <br /> <br />And thus, Ozick leaves us with the age old question:  Is it better to have loved andlost, than never to have loved at all?  Or, as Ozick put it \\"Better never to have loved than loved at all.  Better never to have risen than had a fall.\\"   <br /> <br />The book is recommended for all highly read people as the literary references are many.  And the uses of them are brilliant.  In addition, the book is recommended to anyone who is trying to answer the question of love, in terms of whether it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.  The book provides spiritual, mundane and metaphysical thoughts on the cycle of life and afterlife, that provide highly provocative concepts to consider with regard to that question. <br />	2004-11-03

Instead of the near `saintly' ethical and moral actions and thoughts of his characters in Botswana, McCall Smith deals here with a more advanced culture and the question of conflicting ethical concepts. <br /> <br />In this book, \\"The Sunday Philosophy Club\\" again Smith uses a mystery as the vehicle for his discussion of ethics and morality.  And to make sure that the reader does not miss his obvious point, he actually makes his protagonist, the editor of a journal on Ethics.  Thus, the subject of ethics and morality is at the forefront of all that occurs in the book.  Ironically, all through the book, the Sunday Philosophy Club never actually has a meeting. <br /> <br />Yet, Smith introduces an element of cognitive dissonance.  What happens, when one of the highest moral character, is faced with competing choices, both with totally ethical justifications?  This issue is the focus of Mr. Smith's book.  Smith clearly illustrates that one with even the finest and most upright personal character, may be faced with making a choice between two or more ethical possibilities, and must resolve that dilemma in some way. <br /> <br />As with all Smith's books, he does resolve the mystery for us, and he does so with a particularly elegant ethical and moral touch.  All readers of McCall Smith will continue to be enlightened and entertained by this most recent composition.  All readers concerned with the execution of ethics and morality in real life, should not pass up the opportunity to read this example of how these issues might be resolved in the here and now. <br />	2004-10-30

He brings every American Jew's daily paranoia to reality.  He does this in an incredibly interesting literary and historical manner.  And inevitably, he makes a political statement about present times. <br /> <br />The beauty of Roth's work is its construction.  By overlaying the concept of Fascism in American on a World War II backdrop; he shows with true imagination and creativity, how America could so easily become Fascist in its orientation.  How a well planned and far reaching conspiracy could easily capture the Presidency.  And thereby, impose whatever it wanted to, unilaterally on the American public, including various types of ethnic cleansing, including, but not limited to, all Jews in America. <br /> <br />Roth also pulls the reader in by making the story so personal.  He chooses to tell the story from the perspective of an 8 to 10 year old boy.  And in fact, he is the boy.  And his geographic orientation for the story takes place in New Jersey, New York City and surrounding towns, but also simultaneously, around the country. <br /> <br />Using the character of Charles Lindbergh, the almost heroically admired flyer of incredible American idolization, Roth makes a thinly veiled comparison between Bush and Lindbergh, a known anti-semite and German sympathizer.  This is illustrated so eloquently by Lindbergh himself, in the post script that Roth so gratuitously provides to the readers so they can separate fact from fiction in their minds. <br /> <br />The book is so intense, it brings the reader to the point of horror in its most extreme personal dimension.  The most intense feelings and emotions are adroitly displayed.  And the psychic trauma of such a potential happening is wonderfully rendered, in the City of Newark, New Jersey through Roth's young eyes. <br /> <br />This is a book, that is more than good, it is serious emotional literature, conveying many little secrets and insecurities, but also reminding us, that the only thing that stands between the citizens of the United States of America and abuse of power is truly the US Constitution, which should be cherished forever.	2004-10-15

And Back Again	This book truly is a well crafted and literary set of short stories; all or most of them being autobiographical.  But the author does something special in this book.  Her stories all center around the physical, mixed with the spiritual, mixed with the metaphysical, both alone and in concert, and finally, in the way they seem to co-exist, at least to her perception and observation.<br /><br />The substance of her plot is more a substance of a progression of human feelings, than events.  The events just happen, the reasons, she tells us, are personal, and mostly uncontrollable.  But they ARE.  They exist temporally, spiritually, physically, and metaphysically all at the same time.  How each of us sees these things is a bit like Albert Einstein's General and Special Theories of Relativity.  It all depends on how you come to the words of Annie Dillard, and how we interpret what she is saying.  Whether you can relate to it out of your own experience, or whether you can live it vicariously through Dillard's writing matters not, what matters is the attitude and state of mind that one brings to the stories.<br /><br />For readers interested in a mind expanding vision of reality, and non-reality, this book is beautifully written to take you to all these places.  And it takes you through feelings, that almost every reader can relate to.  It is worth every minute spent on it.	2004-10-04

In addition, what becomes so clear to the reader is the tragic travesty that really resulted from a \\"Failure To Communicate\\" as per the movie \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" with Paul Newman. <br /> <br />The report is structured so that within the first 100 pages, the reader knows that if NORAD, the FAA, The Pentagon and The White House had acted in an efficient and efficacious manner, NONE of the planes would have hit their target.  There was enough knowledge and forewarning for all of those planes to have been shot down by scrambled jets. <br /> <br />This did not happen, because communication and authorization was too slow.  It also did not happen because of methodologies and operating policies developed over the last 45 years, that restricted participants, at least in their minds, from properly sharing information. <br /> <br />Finally, what is found is that even in the great rescues done in NYC following the attacks on the World Trade Center, huge failures existed in the ability of rescue workers to communicate effectively, despite a variety of precautions that had been installed prior, they did not effectively work.  And existing communication channels were so overrun, that it was difficult for anyone to effectively communicate at all. <br /> <br />Perhaps the only real criticism that the Commission mentions about the present administration is that it is surprised that some of the things they suggest have not been already done by the present administration, in the wake of 9/11.  But they do not blame any particular individual or person.  They blame the structure of the government, and the structure especially of the DOD, the FBI and the CIA. <br /> <br />For readers who really want to gain an understanding of the level of unpreparedness that existed in the United States, and still mostly exists today, this book is a fine rendition of the problems we have to face going forward. <br />	2004-09-27

Her prose is truly poetic.  It is sensitive, philosophical, and deeply incisive.  The winner of the National Book Award for 2003, it is one of the finest books of the decade.  There are really few authors who are able to put this level of expression in so few pages.  And each page is like a window upon somebody's soul, whoever she is talking about, as well as the reader. <br /> <br />Set against the backdrop of post WW II occupation, Hazzard expresses so many emotions and feelings in one book, that it is truly exceptional.  With a basic anti-war theme throughout, she creates a love story, a very unlikely love story, that is the central theme of the book.  But within, she shows us, despair, sadness, mutilation, ennui, elation and imbecility, side by side with love, tenderness, sensitivity, human kindness and purity of heart, especially, as that purity meets the cruel, real world.  The book takes a very long trip through an existential reality, yet shows how such reality can be controlled, at least partly, by our decisions and actions. <br /> <br />With stylistic brilliance, Hazzard creates metaphors that are truly magical, and even uses some hugely effective and informative epistilary style with mail, that is not instant, but takes weeks sometimes to travel halfway around the world.  Yet in the face of all this turbulence, this destruction, this horror, what may prevail as the strongest thing, is true and pure love.  While the concept is surely not new, the manner in which Ms. Hazzard expresses it surely is. <br /> <br />This book is suggested for any reader interested in some of the most profound and exquisite writing to be found.  It has appeal to virtually every group of thinking readers.  It is a book that speaks to the reader on many levels, but to all of the readers, it has a way of speaking to them personally.	2004-09-06

The concept of neutrality itself is one of those such topics.  Mediators see themselves as \\"Neutral\\" but Mr. Mayer posits that really there is no such thing as neutral in the truest sense.  That is, all mediators bring to any case, all the emotional, personal and spiritual baggage that makes up their life choices and moral values.   <br /> <br />All of us have some Political Affiliation, or we have NONE, which is in effect, the absence of any one.  We each are either male or female, we have opinions about labor and management, we have various age biases, prejudices and the like, which we bring to every mediation.  Thus can anyone really be fully neutral?  Perhaps not. <br /> <br />Yet this should not stop us in our objective to help people deal with the problems of life.  Rather, we should redefine what we do, so it encompasses what the client might need, not just our definition of a narrow range of activity, i.e. A Mediator.  Specifically, Mayer suggests that we look at the techniques and skills in such fields as facilitation, arbitration, negotiation and coaching.  All of these avocations have intersecting skill sets.  Each of these groups could teach a lot to the other groups, and vice versa. <br /> <br />At this time, when mediation is finally really showing some benefits to many, we must now examine, where we see mediation going in the future, and how we wish to be involved with that evolution of the field.  If nothing else, Mr. Mayer's book raises questions about ethics and values that we should have been talking about for the last 30 years. <br /> <br />	2004-08-18

But what I found had much more impact.  With a style that won't let the reader go, the author moves through the life of Mark Berman, a Russian Immigrant to Canada in 1980.  The stories are extremely autobiographical in character, although the author never states that outright. <br /> <br />Each story, in addition to being on a different topic, follows Mark through the ages of 6 to 16, and then two adult experience based stories after the title story \\"Natasha.\\"  The book is extraordinary in its ability to capture immense and incisive amounts of sensitive information about the characters, and convey it in an almost irresistable style, as he ambles through the very complex integration of a 6 year old Russian immigrant to the democratic environment of Canada and North America in general. <br /> <br />\\"Natasha,\\" the title story really does capture the reader, as it is so illustrative of what we enjoy in North America, and how truly undesirable or worse it is to live in some parts of the world, but so many live in conditions that we in North America just take for granted.  We need to be reminded of what we have, rather than what we do not have all the time.  This book does an acutely prestigous job of elucidating this concept. <br /> <br />As the author's first book, it appears to be a great one.  This author shows tremendous promise, and did something unique, and yet familiar.  He used his own experiences, to write his first book, but he created a piece with a new character, than almost any other book of short stories I have previously read.  However he did it, this book is not to be missed.  It is truly worth anyone's time to invest in reading this fast reading and intimate yet important piece of literature.	2004-08-09

Perhaps that is because it is very autobiographical. In this book, Kesey was writing about what he truly knows, what he actually experienced. <br />  <br /> The story is unique in its intensity, and its focus on the deep seated emotional scars between family members. Pitted against this very personal story is the animosity between the town lumber workers, and Kesey's family, which was a non-Union operation, that did not honor the lumber strike. <br />  <br /> Kesey captures the emotions, feelings and character of the entire region. The fight against the constant rain of the Pacific Northwest, and the rugged individual concept, that drove Americans West in the first place. <br />  <br /> But at the core of it all, Kesey tells so wonderfully the crux of his story, on his title page, where he quotes from the song &quot;Good Night, Irene,&quot; By Huddie Ledbettter and John Lomax: <br />  <br /> &quot;Sometimes I live in the country, <br /> Sometimes I live in the town, <br /> Sometimes I get a great notion <br /> To jump in the river ... an' drown.&quot; <br />  <br /> The entire seasonal depression of the experience and the dark and difficult battle of minds and bodies between the main character and his brother makes the book so personal that it is hard to stop reading his story. <br />  <br /> For all who are interested in the internal emotional workings of semi-functional families, this book creates that milieu with tremendous aplomb. <br />  <br />	2004-08-07

His language is such, that not at any time does he fall victim to the negative and often inaccurate reports of those who are not happy with the LDS Church.  Not a single time, does he say, that the Prophet's words are not true. <br /> <br />The beauty of Remini's book is that in 200 pages, he wrote a fast reading biography, that in essence overlays societal history side by side, with the history of Joseph Smith, Jr. and the creation of the LDS Church. <br /> <br />The long journeys, the hardships, the discrimination and the attempted exterminations are all validated and told with what appears to be historical accuracy.  The point of Mr. Remini's book is not glorification, but truly accurate history.  The author relied very heavily on the writings of Joseph Smith, Jr. and the LDS Church for his information.  He also relied on hundreds of other sources, listed in his Bibliography. <br /> <br />For a fair and unbiased and quick reading understanding of the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Jr., I have not read a better book.

Porter has a unique style of writing, that is hers alone.  Her use of long, but salient and understandable sentences is terrific.  Her use of simile and metaphor is almost unequaled.  And her observational abilities and articulation of inner feelings makes her stand out as one of the best American writers of all time.<br />The book consists of 19 Short Stories/Long Stories/Short Novels and they are all extraordinary.  In a shockingly well written story, she writes in &quot;Pale Horse, Pale Rider&quot; a description of going into a depressive pit, the likes of which I have never seen before, fact or fiction.  Her style is so good, she leaves the reader guessing what is fact and what is fiction, in her fiction, with respect to her plot line in this very surreal story of a lady going into depression.  Her characters are so intimately real life, as to make the reader feel they know them, almost personally.  But what we readers know truly, is how wonderfully Porter expresses herself, and how incredible are her endings and beginnings, as well as wonderfully written middles.<br />No appreciator of American Literature should pass up the opportunity to read this book.  In paperback, it is one of the true bargains in America today.  For about 15 to 25 hours of extreme reading pleasure, this book fits the bill quite perfectly.	2004-07-18

Her writing is well thought out.  Her use of metaphor and simile is fairly rich and delicious.  And her character development is superior.<br />It was indeed refreshing to read Ms. Newcomer's book, as she uses a vocabulary that is significantly more prolific than the average Romance Novelist.  Her book, based on historical realities, is not just a romance novel, but in addition, a work of historical fiction.  She deals quite extensively with Atilla the Hun, and the time period 450 to 500 AD or so.  <br />But at the heart of the novel, is the exposure of the most intimate and private thoughts of her protagonist.  Ms. Newcomer takes her reader into the mind of a lady with great knowledge and sophistication, in a very barbaric world.  The character allows us to see this barbarism, and understand how she was able to come to terms with it, in her own way, which is certainly unique.<br />The book is a real page turning novel and will provide several good hours of entertainment.  It is suggested for anyone who is interested in the romance novel genre, and to anyone interested in the time period and subject she covers.	2004-07-10

This book is the purest and best example of American Existentialism I have ever read.  Not only is the conceptual basis of the book and the mental processes of the protagonist incredibly articulated, but the author's ability to use metaphor is one of the most poignant and accomplished abilities that Percy displays in this book.<br />The true essence of the book is the journey through life that the protagonist takes, in search of avoiding the worst possible state, the \\"malaise of Everydayness.\\"  And even more so, the fight to not become \\"Anyone\\" exhibits the basic tenets of the characters focus and philosophy of life.  He seeks to find newness that does not exist in the regular day to day vicissitudes of life, but something transcendent.  And to fill the time in between, he searches constantly for pleasure, usually in the form of sex with his secretaries.<br />But as the book proceeds, it gets more and more personal, as well as, more and more complex.  Examples of life experiences that the author often calls \\"rotations\\" or \\"duplications\\" are given.  The concept of the \\"genie-soul\\" of each location in the world is explored.  And the fight against the ordinary goes on.<br />As in life and existentialism, many of the questions posed are unanswerable, and the author does not really answer them, as any good existentialist writer would not answer them, because they are unanswerable.  But it is the way the author portrays these unanswerable questions, that is so elegant and incisive.  The reader understands the nebulous state the author is describing and asks himself these questions, but of course, does not have answers either, because, there are no answers, no definitive answers, to those questions.<br />The interplay of ennui and distinctiveness define the book.  The search for distinctiveness is usually overshadowed by the ordinary, thus inducing the feeling of ennui or worse, \\"Everydayness.\\"  And the author carries the concept right to the last line.  This book is really a must read for those readers who enjoy existentialism.  And the beauty of Mr. Percy's articulation cannot be overlooked.	2004-06-06

A talent for painting a picture with the same clarity with which he writes.  In a very real sense, this book is an alleghorical story of most all human life.  To summarize his message, it seems he is telling us this:<br /><br />1)  You are born and childhood is mystical, magical, and all things seem possible.<br />2)  You hit puberty, and life is turned a little upside down from what it was before.<br />3)  You recover from the shock and go on and build a life.<br />4)  Somewhere in the process of building this life, something happens and life itself again gets twisted on its head.<br />5)  You rebuild your life.<br />6)  You hope you retire in peace.<br />While the meaning of the alleghory is poignant, the manner that Auster paints the picture contains even more virtuosity.  The story starts very whimsically, with a sense of magic.  And then, as usual, there is clearly a lose of innocence, and an experiencing of multiple severe personal tragedies.<br />These tragedies ultimately lead his protagonist onto the next phases of his life, as they do with most people.  And in each phase, he rebuilds that life.  And often, because of factors that have nothing to do with his own actions or beliefs, that world is destroyed, and sometimes it is destroyed, because of his actions and beliefs, but each time, he rebuilds, he realizes that he is rebuilding a better life, than the one before.<br />Auster displays his usual incredible sensitivity and insight.  He lays out the mental processes with great aplomb.  And he takes the reader through an experience that in many ways, the reader is able to use as an analogy for their own life.<br />This book is one of Auster's classics and all Auster fans should not miss the opportunity to read it.	2004-05-25

In Smith's 5th book in the &quot;No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency&quot; series, he again concentrates on many of his recurring themes.  Smith uses the detective agency as a backdrop, to discuss the morality and ethics of Botswana, as a microcosm of the whole world.<br />Because Botswana is a relatively small country, much of it being desert, the Botswanians tend to know each other, all over the country.  This intimacy of course is less in the urban environments than in the more traditional rural areas.  Nonetheless, by American standards, even the urban life is rather suburban if not rural in appearance.<br />The issues that Smith concentrates on are the feelings that are universal in virtually every society.  While there are specific nuances in each country, and within a country, in each region, still, there are certain things, that are common to all.  Men will always seek the love of women.  Women will always be more selective than men in choosing their mate.<br />In Botswana, the meeting of the traditional versus the contemporary is deeply explored.  The role of women in the Botswanian society is investigated and parsed.  There are many types of women in Botswana, as there are many types of women in any part of the world.<br />But Smith also finds, that there are similarities between men and women, and that these similarities are universal and accepted by almost all societies.  By using Botswana, as a developing third world nation, Smith allows the reader to look back at the early days of his/her own country, and then see how far their country has come, from inception, to today.  While the detective plots lend an interesting backdrop to Smith's message, the real concentration in all of Smith's books in this series are the way in which people do treat others, and the way in which they should treat others.  The book provides another wonderful view of cross-cultural interactions and perspectives.	2004-05-02

The Real German You Were Never Taught in School	Books	4	49	52	N	Y	Terrific Gutter German	In her book, &quot;Scheisse&quot; Gertrude Besserwisser, which seems to almost have to be a pseudonym, the reader is introduced to really wonderful low Deutsch of the most common variety.  In fact, this is German you don't learn in school, I heard this stuff when I went to Germany, Austria and Switzerland.  But not in school.<br />No profanity is too great for the unabashed Besserwisser.  Wonderful colloquial German expressions of full throttle profanity and abusiveness are introduced in this book, along with illustrations by David Levine that increase the humor of the presentation.<br />The one item that the reader should know, is that basic knowledge of a little German is really a pre-requisite to get the most out of this book.  Although, it is readable, by those who have never spoken a word of German.  And just as funny.  This book is highly recommended for people about to take a trip to a German speaking country.  At least you will know when they are cursing at you, even if you cannot understand all of it.	2004-04-25

Paul Auster's autobiographical account spanning about 12 years or so after he finished college, is an excellent exposition of a young writer's search for meaning, and then the translation of that meaning into money, to provide for further existence, to allow the writer to keep producing work, representative of his desires, but also able to be sold for money to continue the quest.<br />The appeal to almost all people is hidden in the fact, that at anytime, any person, can be living a &quot;hand to mouth&quot; existence.  This feeling of abject poverty and financial ruin is not uncommon today, in an economy that has lost over 2 million jobs, and forced hundreds of thousands to start their own businesses because work was not available.  Those in America who have had to do this, can relate directly to Auster's feelings, especially the salient concept of when will I ever get to the point when I am making a living again, even a somewhat less luxurious one than before, just any living.<br />As usual, Auster uses his incredible incisiveness and truly exceptional clarity in his construction of this book.  It is of special interest to Auster readers, as it gives the reader some very interesting information about the author's early days when he was still struggling to become known.  But Auster's story is one that every actor, every writer, every lawyer, every doctor, or most of them anyway, have to go through at the beginning, including every new entrepreneur.  Becoming established is very hard work.  And more people fail, than succeed.  This high failure rate is generated by the need to be able to sustain high levels of suffering in bad times, to get to the good times.  Most of us are just not up to the task.	2004-04-21

Dick Clarke's gripping tale of the issues of terrorism in the Bush White House, the Clinton White House, and even the Bush '41 and Reagan White House and its evolution or lack thereof within the government are astonishing.<br />While concerns were expressed and started to be dealt with as early as the Reagan and Bush '41 Presidencies, the urgency of the situation did not come to the top of the pile, until the Clinton administration.  Clarke indicates that Clinton was obsessed with terrorism.  In addition, Clarke clearly indicates that Clinton had NO reservation about using military force or other methods to combat terrorism, and he did so on many occasions.  Interestingly, he was constantly criticized by the public, the Congress and the Press as over-reacting to the situations.  Now, it seems people think perhaps he could have done more.<br />The book starts with Clarke's exquisite narrative of how he basically ran the country on 9/11/01.  With authorization from the Vice President and the President, it was Clarke running the crisis, ordering the different departments to do what needed to be done, getting the stock market back in shape to open, etc, etc.<br />This part of Clarke's book is a wonderful tale, a gripping experience.  It appears it will soon be a movie as well.  The rights were recently purchased.  But the roller coaster ride than Clarke and his counterterrorism team lived through in the day of 9/11 and several days afterward was extraordinary.<br />The other thing that Clarke's makes perfectly clear, was that he was not satisfied with the level of response of anyone.  But, he was most satisfied with President Clinton's handling of it, as he did see it as a real and present danger to the United States of America, and made Clarke a cabinet level advisor.<br />It is also clear, that despite vast efforts to the contrary, by the Clinton transition team and subsequently, by Clarke himself, the subject of terrorism was not a priority in the Bush White House, and that Condoleeza Rice was really not interested or informed on the matter prior to 9/11, by her own choice.  She felt the real problems would be with Russia and China.  On terrorism, she was focused on the old style enemy regime terrorism, not the new Al Qaeda method of internet cell manufacture.  She did not consider it a significant problem.<br />This viewpoint seems to be born out by almost everyone else's comments, books and testimony except for Rice, Bush and Ashcroft.  It does seem to be the general opinion of everyone else.  It surely is the opinion of Richard Clarke.<br />The book portrays the incredible machinations that even urgent problems are subjected to in Washington, and the failure of so many to coordinate in the &quot;War on Terror.&quot;  But Clarke felt the real travesty was that even after 9/11, the Bush '43 administration was still not really serious about fighting terror.  Within 2 years of 9/11, Clarke had left his job at the White House and went into private industry, after a career in public service spanning over 20 years.<br />Readers should get this book because it lifts many curtains of the methods of operation in Washington.  It is truly an eye opening experience.	2004-04-19

In Craig Unger's book, he reveals an incredible link between Saudi money, and the last 40 years of the Bush family and their business dealings and investments.  It turns out that Prescott Bush, the Senator from CT, and father of George Bush Sr. '41 was something else, before he retired to be a Senator from CT.  He was the Managing Partner of Brown Brothers Harriman which is a private bank, used only by the rich and famous, as today, BBH will not take an account for less than $3 million in cash/securities.<br />Through these money connections and through Bush '41 and Bush '43 oil connections, incredible amounts of Saudi money were invested in companies that were either owned by the Bush family or that the family had interest in.  The biggest of these is the Carlyle Group, a giant private equity company.  Unger estimates that $1.4 Billion was invested by Saudi's in the Carlyle Group which very much directly benefitted the Bush family.<br />But the most interesting part of Unger's book, is the fact that it was published between that of O'Neill's book and Clarke's book, and thus got a bit of the short shrift in the marketing department.  However, Unger's book supports both O'Neill's book and Clarke's book.<br />Apparently, a little known fact is that during the period between 9/11 and 9/13/2001, there were several commercial non-military airplanes flying over the skies of the US of A.  These planes contained members of the Saudi Royal Family and the Bin Laden family, who were congregating in Lexington, KY in readiness to evacuate the country.<br />No one else was allowed to fly.  Former President Clinton was stuck in Australia at the time and was not allowed to fly back in.  Former V-P Al Gore was in Austria at the time and was not allowed to fly back in.  But with White House approval, a bunch of Saudi's, about 140 all told, were not only allowed to fly during the no fly period, but some even left the country on 9/13, prior to Logan International being reopened for commercial traffic, with special White House Clearance.  This event is what Unger characterizes as the &quot;Greatest Crime In American History.&quot;  When the country is devastated, when the vast majority of the hijackers and killers had been identified as Saudi Nationals, and in cooperation with Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the White House lets 140 members of the Saudi Royal Family and members of the bin Laden family, to fly, unimpeded, around and out of the country.<br />Unger's book gives excruciating detail about the connections between the Bush '43 administration and the Saudi Royal Family.  In fact, George W. Bush was personal friends with Prince Bandar, as was his father.<br />Unger explicitly indicates, that it is difficult to imagine that a President would act entirely in the national interest, when his personal interest is so tightly tied to the interests of Saudi Arabia.  Therefore, in addition to the failure to develop a cohesive anti-terrorism plan, despite Richard Clarke's preparedness to do so at anytime, and his plan sitting doing nothing waiting for the NSC to review it, the Bush administration badly damaged our ability to really properly respond to a threat such as the type that Al Qaeda was and is involved in still to this day.  And that the very funders of this terror are also the closest allies of the Bush family.  And that this indeed seems to represent a serious conflict of interest for the President of the United States of America.<br />This is recommended reading for all US citizens who want to have at least a glimpse of the truth, without nearly the spin that the White House is putting on its statements today in the news.  It is highly recommended for its well researched factual revelations.	2004-03-29

His sentence structure and precision in language makes virtually all his books a pleasure to read.  This one is no exception.<br />The story is one of disbelief and increduality, like many of Paul's books, the plot is a virtual illusion.  But the book is a book of fiction, that is written almost as a detective story, with pieces of information being slowly revealed to the reader as he goes along.<br />In fact, perhaps the only negative criticism of the book would be, that the first 200 pages have its moments where the story is just a bit droll, but the reader is pushed forward, by the magnificence of Auster's writing.<br />In essence, Auster has a protagonist who is living in an elusive dream world, chasing after information about another person who also lived in a complete dream world, and at the same time, meeting a romantic partner, whose identity is in and of itself, never fully resolved for the reader.<br />Yet as all great books of literary triumph, this book pulls the reader back over and over again, until the end is reached.  The book is mind expanding in the way it shows life as both reality and illusion.  And it is concrete in that it reveals many things that all humans feel, but do not always express.  The book should be read by all people, seeking to expand their limited view of reality and to join Paul Auster in the belief, that much of what is real, cannot be seen, or appears to be either an illusion or a delusion.	2004-03-18

Most readers remember when they first read Charles Dickens and found his 'Deus Ex Machina' technique and his coincidences just too ridiculous to believe they actually happen in real life.  However, they do.  Everyone has some incredible coincidences that are basically one in a million chances, but just happen to take place.<br />Auster seems to have noted these incidents through his entire life, and then compiled them in this book.  The coincidences are extraordinary, but not things that are impossible, just things that are extremely improbable.  Auster enhances his style, by the use of &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; elements.  His use of initial names is something that Kafka did all the time.  And his ironic twists are also in the vein of Kafka, but instead of being novelistic, they are real and true stories.<br />The book is sure to captivate virtually any reader, and its conciseness both in writing and in length makes it an easily absorbed and quickly read piece of literature.	2004-03-12

She makes few sacrifices with her style for the sake of saleability.  He story is crisp, poignant, and easily read.  Her metaphors are quite excellent.  And her descriptions of people and places give quite enough to let the reader feel he is there on the scene, or at least can imagine it vividly.<br />Ms. Tyler portrays the hardships of marriage as well as the joys.  And her main character gets to experience much of both, but it happens in two different marriages.  The fact of the matter though is, that all people in their first marriage are amateurs.  They either adapt and communicate with each other, or eventually, the pain gets too great to bear, and the marriage collapses.  <br />Interestingly, Tyler treats the death of one of her main characters as a little mysterious, but a seeming suicide.  The reader gets this definite feeling of suicide As the last thing that we hear the character say is something about how everything is just fine and dandy.  That is a big sign, when a person is severely depressed, that they have found the final solution.<br />It truly does describe the vicissitudes of everyday married life, and what happens to different people as they move through the journey of life.  This is truly a thought provoking book which all people would be enlightened by, married or not.	2004-03-09

In this book, Dr. Laura presents what could be called the &quot;Contemporary Theory of Husbands.&quot; She tries to encourage women to cast off the influence of the feminist movement which has fostered feelings that have allowed women to use their time in non-productive men-bashing, rather than in trying to analyze what they really want, and how to get it.<BR> <BR>Dr. Laura states the following, &quot;Remember, men are simple creatures and very dependent on their wives for acceptance, approval and affection.&quot; Her basic theory being, that if men get that from their wives, their wives will get back many fold, what they give. And also, Dr. Laura wishes that woman would analyze carefully what they have because of their husbands and what they want out of life, and make the decision based on those factors. <br />While her theory is surely not neo-Freudian or neo-Jungian, it has a very high potential to work in present day marital situations. She stresses the need for honest and meaningful communication. And she tries to point out the reality, that a successful marriage is hard work, and both partners have responsibilities within the relationship. <br />Dr. Laura simplifies a lot of the problems and answers, but unlike test data in a lab, Dr. Laura's evidence actually comes from empirical field data by helping real people sort these things out on her radio show, and through letters and her other activities. <br />It should be clearly stated, that Dr. Laura does NOT advocate being a stay at home mom, but she does advocate the concept that women are more responsible for child rearing than men. In addition, she states that the woman should have more responsibility in a marriage than a man, to provide the things that the man wants, and to be the leader in productive and meaningful communication.This is arguable. Both parties really have some responsibility to this in a marital relationship. <br />I found Dr. Laura's commentary on embryology and &quot;hard wired&quot; genetic differences between men and women, which start at about 8 weeks into gestation in the womb. There is considerable evidence to suggest, that all of us, are born with both male and female &quot;hard-wiring&quot; but the hard wiring that is expressed, is that which is activiated by the particular hormonal mix running through the veins of the specific person. Thus, it has been shown in hundreds or animal studies and now, with transexuality, that if one changes the hormonal balance, that an animal will act in normal programmed ways as would the opposite sex, and that really it is the hormones that control the &quot;hard-wiring&quot; that is selected and displayed, not so much the physical equipment.<BR> <BR>Dr. Laura addresses some other highly relevant subjects in her book, perhaps the most important of which in marriage are the issues of &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;guy time.&quot; She does a wonderful job of exploring this with support of her listeners conversations and letters. <br />If there is anything at all that Dr. Laura could have done a little better at, was that I think she went slightly overboard on the concept of &quot;repition brings remembrance.&quot; Her book often goes over the same point or concept in multiple places. But I know, that this was intentionally done by Dr. Laura.<BR> <BR>In all, the book is a wonderful book for both men and women, as it helps both understand the other, and work at productive and happy marriages.	2004-03-05

The layout allows managers to quickly locate key concepts within the book by boxing those particular points and using a coded indicator as to what type of advice is contained therein. The manager is directed to organize their thoughts and steps, prior to an impending large negotiation, such as a Labor Contract or Pricing On Major Components, etc. Mr. Cohen focuses on the techniques associated with \\"interest based bargaining.\\" Using interest based bargaining techniques, both sides get some and in certain cases, ALL of what they need out of the bargain, and so does the other side. <br />Mr. Cohen gives some special tips on how to get ready for negotiations and then discusses \\"Stakeholders, Constituents and Interests.\\" These factions are the ones that establish the power balances within the negotiation. <br />The book gives succinct and very understandable advise for managers who need to learn a bit about productive bargaining to assist them in doing their jobs.  The book is recommended for all who negotiate, either experienced or novice, as the book serves to reinforce and remind even senior negotiators of tools and techniques and how they can be used.	2004-02-21

In Vapnyar's book, she shows a tremendous talent for integration and understand of personal feelings, and particularly, some nuances of prejudice, that we don't often consider.  Most, but not all, of the stories in this book take place in Russia.  Part of Vapnyar's brilliant writing style in this short book of short stories is her ability to capture so vividly, the picture and feeling of the surrounding environment in very few words, but her descriptions never seem incomplete.<br />The title story is particularly poignant, and shows the level of anti-semitism in Russia mostly in the 1940's, and how while it was there, it was not the same as that of Poland, which was ingrained in the society for 100's of years, or that of Germany, which was institutionalized by the Nazi party.  Yet, it was still there, it was always there.  And when a person started to get on another's nerves, when they were more successful, when they were more literate, when they did things that were beyond the ability of the other individual, well the answer cannot be, that I am inferior, it must be, that they are Jews.<br />But must it?  Perhaps, if perception is reality.  Even the children in her story, \\"A Question For Vera\\" are indoctrinated in some of the usual anti-semitic methods of the time, including phrenology.  It is in this very story, that Vapnyar poses the question, so reminiscent of Shakespeare's Shylock in the \\"Merchant of Venice\\" when he says, \\"...If you prick us do we not bleed?...\\"  But Vapnyar says it her way, \\"What if ... there wasn't anything bad or special about being Jewish?  Katya looked around.  There was nobody to answer that question...\\"<br />Aside from her incredible insight, it is so much the more so interesting, that English is not Ms. Vapnyar's first language.  She is a Russian immigrant who came to New York in 1994, the book blurb says.  But she has mastered the language of English, so finely, so delicately, that she can express these intricate and personal feelings,so very well, in English.  She truly has broad talent.  I would expect she will produce much more for readers to enjoy and ponder as her career expands.	2004-02-14

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	5	32	34	N	N	On Day 10:  Bush Targets Iraq	Suskind's rendering of Mr. Paul O'Neill's tenure as Secretary of the Treasury is truly eye opening.  O'Neill was on the National Security Council as the Treasury Secretary and also had unusual access to the President, in his position.<br />O'Neill's background as a Federal Employee for many areas of the government, including Dir. of the OMB, gave O'Neill a truly unique ability to size up the economy very quickly.  In addition, a 30 year friendship with Federal Reserve Chairman  Greenspan offered a unique opportunity to both Greenspan and O'Neill, of being able to work together to really make things happen.<br />O'Neill, who had a personal net worth of about $200 million after finishing his 13 years with Alcoa Aluminum, had vast and broad experience in the world of real business too, not just public finance.  So, he was excited about the situation and while he had a lot of reservations about accepting the job, he took it.<br />The book tells an amazing story of a President that had little or no real interest in the economy.  At first it seemed to O'Neill that it was unusual that the President did not ask him relevant questions about the economy.  But then, O'Neill figured out, he just did not know what questions to ask.  That he was grossly unprepared to be President of the United States, and that he did not seem to really be calling the shots.<br />In the end, O'Neill, who tried to do wonderful things, was undercut by the ONLY 2 policies that the Bush administration really had, namely:  1)  A big and immediate tax cut and 2)  Get control of Iraq.  Yes, in fact as early as the very first cabinet meeting, 10 days after Bush assumed the office, he announced those were his priorities.  Nothing else really mattered, except maybe Cheney's energy policy.<br />And so, the Bush '43 Presidency went blithely along, with no Foreign Policy to speak of, no Domestic Economic Policy, no real agenda, except to cut taxes and take out Iraq.  The entire first third or so of the Administration was an effort to muster public support for a war, that they clearly were shown by intelligence briefs, did not have what they thought it had.  As we know now, they had nothing.<br />Finally, in December of 2003, President Bush fired Mr. O'Neill.  Upon being asked to reflect upon his tenure, he was asked by the author, Ron Suskind what at this point could make a difference to help the resilient American economy recover.  O'Neill answered, &quot;Truth,&quot; he said, mostly to himself.  &quot;Just Truth.&quot;<br />The book reveals an administration that is almost impossible to believe, but is true.  If the machinations of Washington politics are of interest to you, this is the book to read.	2004-02-10

But her purpose is to look at the particular cross-cultural problems, especially for children of Indian parents, in the United States.  After all, these children are Americans, not Indians.  The emotional struggle to deal with that dissonance is finely described by Lahiri, perhaps better than I have ever seen it done before.  The internal feelings, self-rationalizations and justifications, and the result of what environment and origin have on people and how that transition can be made, sometimes successfully, but mostly, with some problems and regrets, are beautifully elucidated.<br />Lahiri's style is fine tuned and explicit.  She is insightful and incisive.  Her vocabulary is vast, but is not used with academic arrogance in any way.  She has a crystal clarity about her writing that leaves little to guess for the reader, but much to ponder.  Her subplots mesh seamlessly into a well honed novel.<br />In addition, it is important that the reader not miss Lahiri's reference to Nikolai Gogol's short story, \\"The Overcoat.\\"  It really is impossible for the reader to miss, it is one of the main premises of Lahiri's plot.  The reader is well advised to read the story before reading the book, as the plots are interwoven in certain non-obvious manners.  But near the end, Lahiri tackles one of the main issues of everyone's life, her protagonist and that of \\"The Overcoat.\\"  She seeks to interpret in some way, how so many of the events in our lives seem out of our control, even random.  Toward the end, Lahiri has her protagonist, named Gogol, say this:  \\"In so many ways, his family life feels like a string of accidents, unforeseen, unintended, one incident begetting another.\\"  But as in \\"The Overcoat\\" Lahiri tries to tell us, that in some way, the soul can and does live on, in the hearts of those who remember.  And just as in \\"The Overcoat\\" the remnant of the protagonist's soul remains, so too, the remnant of Gogol's father's soul still remains, in Gogol's memory, forever.	2004-02-02

In addition, Toole depicts the events and characters so humorously and comically, that it is almost impossible not to laugh out loud while reading the book.<br />Sadly, Toole took his own life, when he was unable to find a publisher.  However, his mother persevered, found a publisher, and the book won the National Book Award the year it was published.<br />With astonishing brilliance, Toole describes in fairly graphic detail, the basically non-productive life of the protagonist, and the mess he gets himself into, by creating his own little world, which has little relation to the real world around him.<br />Ultimately, he ends up in a true crisis, and is only extricated, by his college friend from Manhattan.  This book is truly a piece of comic relief that is timeless in its amusement.  It should not be missed.	2004-01-28

It is hard to imagine, how a Rape could also be a love story, which is a reflection of the ingeniousness of the title.  Yet Oates does in fact, develop a love story, through her protagonist, her narrator, and as Joyce would say herself, \\"her voice\\" in this work.<br />The protagonist is a twelve year old girl.  In fact, the daughter of the victim.  And here is injected an astonishing irony, that a victim, of the most heinous of crimes, can find a love, deeply buried in this horrid experience.<br />While Oates first chapter is clearly written in the style of Donald Barthelme, a style she used to argue against, but then adopted and adapted to her own special use, it is wonderfully graphic in its descriptiveness of the incident, the setting of the scene, and the preparation of the reader to take in the rest of the story.<br />Her psychological style, so reminiscent at times of D. H. Lawrence, continues to be fascinating, but yet, all the more so, through a 12 year old girl's eyes.  And the girl in fact, has a love affair, in her mind, with her guardian angel, or so Oates would have us believe.  And yet, clearly, it was in the eyes of that girl, an intense and indelible experience, as in some way or another, she continues to love her angel, for the rest of her life, never revealing it to public scrutiny, but only in her heart.<br />The book is truly a terrific sketch of a conceptual psychological interpretation of events, that even with its macabre and gothic elements is exquisitely constructed.	2004-01-15

His use of long footnotes to express the difference between the protagonist's thoughts, not declared, versus those declared, or additional information about a topic, that is extremely helpful to following his meaning.<br />Central to his book is the question of time.  What is time, is it the 4th dimension, can it be traveled in, does Einstein's theory really represent reality, that it is impossible to go into the future, what is the philosophy of future time travel, all these questions are mixed with the question of how much does a person themselves, travel, or detect the fluctuations in the space-time continuum (i.e. precogniton), and how much do our own thoughts, deeds and actions or inactions actually affect the outcome of time?<br />While Auster used perhaps just a touch too much foreshadowing in his book, it is not the plot line so much that Auster seems to wish to convey, as the dilemmas of the characters, and how those dilemmas feel to the characters.  The actual results are less important than the thoughts and deeds leading up to the results.  In fact, that perhaps is what Auster is trying to say, that the future is both changeable, and immutable at the same time.  How can anyone truly know at this time.<br />This book is destined for greatness, it is easy to read, not too long, and not written with an erudite vocabulary that only those who have a PhD in literature can understand.  And yet, Auster's message is deep, very, deep, and very personal, and very intimate.  It is an experience that all should try to enjoy.	2004-01-02

He uses both a temporal and narrative montage, where time is switched on the reader, indicated only by the start of a new chapter.  And the narration is sometimes in the head of the character or the dialogue of the characters that Beaven is focusing at the time.<br />While reading the first 150 pages, I could not really seperate a feeling of traces of Katherine Anne Porter's tremendous fictional work, &quot;Ship Of Fools&quot; but in a sense, I guess all cruises in one way or another are a ship of fools.  Beaven is particularly heavy on his use of adjectives, to the detriment of his objective.  He is overly involved with the scenery, the views, the coastlines, the interractions with others, that are described by him with almost endless strings of adjectives and adverbs.  But, he tries hard to build a well written novel, which is more than just a plain old story.<br />Beaven's book is truly an alleghory, as so many books really are.  And in this one, without the reader realizing it, until the last section of the book, the alleghory is rather well put, by the threat of some type of nuclear contamination.  But once again, this is not Beaven's true point.  Beaven's true point, is how people live their lives, the hypocrisy, the airs, the specious interractions, the ridiculous facades, the true love of those truly in love, and how that love transcends virtually all, everything, to become a force of its own, regardless of the raging world around it.<br />The book shows a style of writing that is still a little immature, that needs some refinement.  But yet, it has its moments of pure captivation.  It is a good reading novel.	2003-12-25

Granted, his protagonist is a rather high functioning autistic, who communicates fairly effectively in words.  This ability would have to be necessary in order for it to be credible that anyone who is autistic can write a book.<br />But the things that struck me in the book were the fact that all of us have these feelings, but for one reason or another, we are able to control them, or at least control them 99.94% of the time, as opposed to someone who is autistic, with only an ability of about 0 to 60% control.<br />This revellation was startling, and worth reading the book in and of itself.  To understand what might be going on in an autistic person's head, is to allow more effective communication with the person.  Haddon's elucidation of what it 'feels like' to be autistic was truly an excellent depiction.	2003-11-16

And true to those roots, his showcase story, &quot;Bulawayo&quot; does take place in Botswana, but since it is set in 1951, he uses the old name, Rhodesia.<br />This book is truly masterfully crafted.  Smith describes 9 'dates' that men and woman have, and mostly, the problems they encounter in the dating.  Only 2 of his stories end 'happily' if you will.  The others are virtual disasters.  But the beauty of the construction of the book is how the complexity of the dating gets more complicated and the story Smith tells about each has a somewhat different character, although a certain dryness of style that Smith uses is unmistakably done intentionally.<br />Smith's wonderfully &quot;Freudian&quot; story &quot;Intimate Accounts&quot; is just like reading out of &quot;The Psychopathology of Everyday Life&quot; by Freud himself.  And in his final date,&quot;A Heavenly Date&quot; he describes what seems to be, a modern day story of an immaculate conception.  Yet there are other explanations, as there are for the Biblical event, the feeling of ethereality is truly entrancing.<br />The book shows the great talent that Smith possesses for understanding and communicating the thoughts and actions of people.  And once again, shows that no matter what culture you are in, the human problems are always much the same, whether they are spoken in English, French, German or Setswana, they are still the same types of problems.	2003-11-16

Coetzee is the master of saying the most sublime things in few and simple words.  His prior books deal with the human existence in a way that every person can understand.  Simple, yet incredibly elegant.<br />In this book, we see none of the same.  This book is constructed using a much more literary style, which not just any person can pick up and absorb.  The interpretation of Coetzee's meaning is highly bound up in a relationship between the author, &quot;Elizabeth Costello&quot; and her relationship with the world around her.  As a vehicle, Coetzee employs the use of Kafka's story by reference, many, many times, not only in text and title, but in plot as well.  For the story, &quot;A Report To An Academy&quot; by Kafka, involves the interplay of the animal mind with the human mind, or at least Kafka's conception of it, in an existential backdrop.<br />In fact, Coetzee does not even tell you the name of the story he is referencing until around page 60, yet by page 20, he has referenced the story at least 3 times.  The book goes on to examine, deeply, the relationship of people with the world, and the world of animals, and how it intersects with the world of people.<br />In a sense, the entire book is a 'report to an academy' yet Coetzee makes that even more poignant, by having the protagonist's sister make a speech to an academy, which in itself reemphasizes the ethics, morals and values that Coetzee is trying to bring attention to.<br />The book is truly a masterpiece of literary integration.  Many, many references are made to other literature, from the modern to the classical Greek.  The reader needs to be armed with some level of reading experience in order to get full force out of Coetzee's message here.  However, for those who are Coetzee enthusiasts, this book along with his many others, only confirms again, what the Booker Prizes and the Nobel Prize awarded to J.M. Coetzee did; he is a master author, capable of producing some of the most sophisticated literature in more than one form, as we now see.  This book is truly a masterpiece of modern literature.	2003-10-30

Camus was very specific and deliberate as to when he would publish what.  This novel, the first written by Camus, has been published after being reclaimed from his papers.<br />The question that comes to mind then, is &quot;Why did Camus never publish this work?&quot;  It seems that the book was a transitional writing for Camus.  It allowed him to move forward from the life he had always thought about, to the life he believed he lived in, that being an &quot;existential&quot; existence.<br />In reading the book, one finds that Mersault, the protagonist, seems to have too many moments of happiness as compared to other protagonists in Camus' other publications.  This in fact, is probably an autobiographical reflection of Camus' early life, and the book, a work to allow him to metamorphosize, transform his vision into what came next, &quot;The Stranger.&quot;<br />The beauty of the novel is recognizing this transition and then, with such recognition, comes the ability to apply those thought patterns and feelings to Camus' later works, seeing how he transformed from a &quot;regular&quot; human being, to an &quot;existentialist&quot; one who has the feeling of being unique, and apart from others and the world around him.<br />The book gives valuable insight into Camus' mental process as he moves from where he was, to where he will go.  For Camus readers, the book is truly a MUST.  And for anyone with an interest in the &quot;Existential&quot; genre, it is truly an enlightening piece of literature.	2003-10-21

The book is highly insightful and serious, yet still hilarious.  Bakeman and Krinbring premise their book on what I would like to consider the &quot;Bakeman-Krinbring Axiom.&quot;  That is the following:  &quot;MEN LOVE WOMEN MORE THAN WOMEN LOVE MEN.&quot;<br />To some this seems self-evident, but to some, this concept is at the very least foreign if not anathema.  But B &amp; K go on to explain that the things they discuss in their book are really the results of people interacting in society in accordance with their genetic programming.<br />This observation is highly savvy and astute, as it brings together concepts of psychology, sociology, genetics, evolution and marital therapy.  If as Darwin believed in the &quot;Origin of Species&quot; that in essence, men are genetically wired to have as many offspring as possible with as many women as possible; and women are genetically wired to be selective in who they mate with, then the result is the situation which leaves women looking for what they need for them and their progeny, with men looking mostly just to increase total progeny.<br />While B &amp; K's incisive observations and suggestions are surely things that will improve marital harmony, they do remind us, that women always WIN!  However, B &amp; K effectively say to women in this book, 'we know you know all this stuff already, but now you know men know it too.'  The book is truly a very vast generalization of American Marriage, but in addition, it is so universal that virtually every married person will recognize and laugh at some of the things they say in their book. <br />However, this review would not be complete without the caveat to men, that this book should not be shared with one's wife.  There is almost no way to defend what you know in this book to be true, without getting into a flaming argument with your wife.  So, the idea is, read the book, learn from it, and use it to increase your overall marital harmony, without revealing you had a little help along the way.	2003-10-14

That is what Sara Nelson's new book, So Many Books, So Little Time screamed out to me when it arrived.  I have so many of the same problems.  I always have at least 500 books in my \\"to read\\" pile, and they are triaged in importance, the order of which is subject to change at any second depending on my needs as a reader.  So, when I saw this book, I figured it will bring a solution to my dilemma.  I was wrong, and will explain why as I go on.<br />As early as the Prologue and the first chapter, so appropriately named, \\"Great Expectations,\\" as I believe it expressed Sara's intent at the beginning of this reading project, and it expressed the reader's state upon entering her creation; I was completely committed.  And I continued to feel great expectations with each chapter that I read.  While it did take me 3 days to read the book, longer than it should have, I did take to carrying it everywhere with me in those 3 days, a behavior that is rare for me.  <br />The book describes Sara Nelson's one-year journey to read books of her selection and to write about the experience.  But as all of us `read-a-holics' know, the next book we read is always driven by circumstances that we cannot predict.  Thus it was for Ms. Nelson as well.  She had a well chosen list of books she wanted to read, but ended up reading several that she did not intend to, and not reading some that she did intend to.  This process could have been predicted by any well-addicted reader.  We all know, that what we want to read next, may not be what we thought we would want to read next, when we started what we are reading now.<br />It was with great pleasure that the author mentions Anne Lamott's book Bird By Bird as I felt from chapter 2 that Nelson's book had the same, `look and feel' as Lamott's; but with a very significant difference.  Lamott is trying to teach us how to self-discipline ourselves to write.  Nelson is telling us what happens to us when we read.  And in so many ways, she was right on.  In page after page, Nelson explains what she looks for in a book, why she likes it, and sometimes why she doesn't like it, and sometimes, nothing at all.<br />Her November 25 chapter is particularly interesting and speaks of opening lines.  She is right; you only get one opening line.  And had she not mentioned Melville and opening lines, I would have completely missed the full implications of her opening line, which I went back to read after I read that chapter.  \\"Call me Insomniac.\\"  Despite the overt reference to the story of the Great White Whale, I would have missed it, because her first line did exactly what she wanted it to do, it captured me and reeled me in, because, like her, I am an insomniac.  <br />In the final analysis, I would recommend that all read-a-holics put this book into their \\"MUST READ\\" pile with special prejudice toward bringing it to the top of the pile.  As read-a-holics, we must stick together.  This book is one of the finest books for serious readers I have found.  And she did NOT solve my problem; because she suggested so many books I had never read yet, that I now have another 5,000 pages on my shelf as recommendations.  Be careful, Sara reads everything, even those 1200 page tomes that we often avoid, but shouldn't.  Happy Reading!	2003-10-14

He again shows the constant battle between traditional values and modern values and their interaction in Botswana.<br />However, in this book, Smith goes even further than he has before.  He engages in conveying the ability of people to self-empower themselves.  In this book, Smith illuminates the continual problem of a male dominated society and how this situation affects the women of Botswana.  Throughout the book, there are multiple examples of the women of Botswana self-empowering, and feeling the tremendous elation and self-satisfaction that accompanies that accomplishment.  Starting particularly with Mma Makutsi, Assistant Detective, who starts a business teaching MEN how to type.  And it is an immediate success, as men often feel internal cognitive dissonance that they cannot type for themselves, and have to depend on women to do their typing.  The concept of the class itself is self-empowerment for men.  And the business itself allows Mma Makutsi to feel self-empowered herself, the proprietor of a successful business.<br />While the books are &quot;plugged&quot; as &quot;mystery/fiction&quot; most readers of the &quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency&quot; series recognize, that the cases, the investigations, are really just a device to advance the plot and to help illustrate the points which mostly deal with ethics, morality and how people treat each other.  This is truly what Smith is trying to get across and by using Botswana, a small, proud, independent, Democratic country as a microcosm of the world, he tries to help the reader understand cross cultural issues and basic ethical concepts which are slightly different in each venue, but are nonetheless, universal around the world.<br />Smith gives us yet again, a close look at the internal workings of another society and allows the reader to draw their own conclusions as to how it relates to the world they live in themselves.  Truly a wonderful and instructive series, this book deserves the 5 star rating.usions as to how it relates to the world they live in themselves.

He investigates such concepts as some Botswanians are liars.  Most tell the truth about most things, but there are still some things, that Botswanians will not tell about.  Some Botswanian women are beautiful and some are not.  Some Botswanian women play around, and are promiscuous, others are more chaste.  And again, certainly, Smith discusses the concept of Traditional Values in the Modern World and how they mesh, and how they do not mesh.<br />But what the reader notices, is these things that Smith showcases in his book, these values, these ethical standards, and the resulting mix, are not just Botswanian.  They are American, Swiss, Russian, Portuguese, Indian, Italian, Australian, in fact, they are the same types of moral and ethical issues that all societies wrestle with all over the world.<br />In this book, Smith deals less with detective stories and much more with ethics and human commonality.  He even tackles depression as a very common and treatable human illness.  And he comments on beauty contests, both the good and the bad.  And even with this change of focus, Smith still keeps us with those same characters, acting the same way, and shows us how they analyze ethics and morality of others in comparison to their own.  In addition, just so his characters are not superhuman, he also introduces some character faults within them as well.  This introduction of a few negatives, makes his characters much more real as human beings.  And after all, it seems, that what Smith's message is here, is that morality and ethics are woven into the fabric of everyday life, just as much as eating and sleeping.  No matter where one lives and who one interacts with, the issues of ethics and morality in dealings with others must be considered.  And if it be true, that no man is an island; then it also is true, that all men and women, mustcome to terms with some model of ethics and morality, that they can internally justify.<br />Smith has an uncanny ability to use Botswana as a microcosm of the world.  And even more so, a microcosm of the free and democratic countries of the world.  For Botswana is a free and democratic country, and they are a very proud people.  There are many such countries in the world.  And in most things, they can be compared, at least metaphorically to the microcosm of Botswana.	2003-10-01

What is truly impressive and unique about Wolfe's writing is not only the intuitive incisiveness with which he articulates human thought and emotion; but just as astonishing, is his ability to articulate these things with utter and precise clarity.<br />There is not one sentence in his book that does not make total sense upon first reading.  If it seems not to, it is only because the reader has skipped a line.  With a vocabulary that is vast, but which he uses with unique precision, Wolfe tells the story of George Webber, a writer, who is in essence, Thomas Wolfe, the writer.  Wolfe ultimately sees himself as an artist that is an observer of human thought and action.  But in addition, one that has an obligation to do what one can, to stamp out ugliness, violence, injustice, inhumanity, and so many other wrongs that rear their heads in society from time to time.<br />Yet, even with this extraordinary brilliance, clarity, and understanding of the human condition, like all great writers and great artists, he leaves the reader with a question.  If clearly, it is his understanding of his personal duty, his personal philosophy to work to do what one can do, to end injustice, then why, is he, personally, always running away?  As the book is a picture of one always on the move, always observing people, always changing venue, but wisely with great proficiency and efficacy, storing these experiences away as he seeks his understanding of the human condition; he is constantly yet on the move.  And so, how does one work to stamp out injustice, if one is always running from the place he is at, and believes &quot;He can't go home again?&quot;  This then becomes the challenge to the reader as well.  And thus, the questions of the &quot;meaning of life&quot; are never fully answered.  How really could they be?<br />For those who wish to see an example of one man try to find those answers, with the clearest articulation I have ever seen in any book, one should read Wolfe's book as soon as possible.  It reads moderately quickly, due to Wolfe's amazing clarity.  And it does articulate many of the answers to many of the questions that all thinking people ask themselves as they go through life.wers, with the clearest articulation I have ever seen in any book, one should read Wolfe's book as soon as possible.

Each of her adventures are well illustrated and wonderfully narrated.  And yet, Smith gives us more in this book than in his first with respect to the cultural elements of Botswanian society.<br />He clearly points out the traditional Botswanian approach to life versus the modern day approach.  The loss of certain values within the society are elucidated.  And the reaction of those who still hold to more traditional values is described.<br />And yet, once again, Smith paints a truly wonderful and revealing picture of a proud country, that sees itself on the leading edge of Democracy in the African continent.  The book is extremely fine in its genre and a recommended read of all observers of human behavior.	2003-09-13

Roth chose to use a 7 year old boy to narrate his story, thus making it more visceral and intense.  Roth takes advantage of a 7 year old's state of mind and innocence, to portray the mid-childhood experience in a NY City East Side tenement ghetto.<br />Though Roth happened to choose a Jewish part of the ghetto to portray in his story, the true beauty and excellence of the book, is that the story could have taken place in any one of the ghettos of New York City.  It can easily be generalized to the Irish immigrant experience, or the Chinese immigrant experience, or the Italian immigrant experience or virtually any other immigrant experience at that time.  All of those immigrants experienced this cultural mixing and its attendant discriminations as immigrants in New York City in the 1920's and 1930's.<br />Roth published his book in the midst of the depression in 1934.  But it came to real prominence when printed in paperback in 1964.  The books true appeal is that it is universal to all Americans, except Native American Indians.  All of the rest of Americans immigrated somewhere in their past.  And thus, whether one be an immigrant today, or a 1st generation American or 2nd or 3rd, even if our ancestors came over on the Mayflower, we are all immigrants somewhere in our past.<br />Even if one's ancestors were Pilgrims, parts of Roth's book would ring true for them as well.  Through the use of intricate analysis of the thoughts of Roth's main character, he portrays those innate emotions that we have all experienced, and from time to time, continue to experience.<br />The book is highly informative, highly emotional and highly entertaining.  It reads very quickly, and is written impeccably.  \\"Call It Sleep\\" is truly one book that all Americans should have in their collection.	2003-08-14

In this book, Smith writes about a place very little known to his American readers, his story is located in Botswana.  This country is a free, independent, Democratic state that borders South Africa.  But given its placement in world geography, it is at a very different stage of development, than our world in the USA.  Botswana has telephones, and electricity.  But no high speed Internet.  And not that many paved roads.<br />Life is much simpler there than it is here, but by no means easier.  And a traditional morality is still pervasive, although diminishing.  But the beauty of Alexander McCall Smith's book is that it is so simple, yet so elegant.  It seems very much like he went to the &quot;J.M. Coetzee&quot; school of authorship.  He is able to convey intense human feelings and interactions without resorting to 'highbrow' vocabulary.  He conveys the values and the visual images of Botswana with tremendous aplomb and creativity.<br />The entire story is based on a tremendously creative and almost brazen assumption.  This concept being, that a lady, could actually become a private detective in Botswana.  Not only does she make this attempt, but in fact, she is the ONLY lady detective in Botswana.  And without any of the high speed computer data base technology of America and Western Europe, she solves her cases, the very old fashioned way, as they did about 50 or 60 years ago in America, with good, hard work and research, and great intuition.<br />But more than the plot lines, Smith seems dedicated to helping his readers understand, that even though some things may be different in different cultures and different locations, people are still people, and there are some universal values, that are shared, by most of the hard working and industrious people all over the world.<br />This book is truly a very thought provoking one.  It is also a wonderful example of cross-cultural interaction.  For, even as it is cross cultural for Americans to look at Botswana.  It is also cross cultural, for a Botswanian to look at the other cultures of Africa in comparison to their own.  And they are very proud of their own.  This book is high level conceptual philosophy in a format, that masquerades as simple mystery, but is much more.  Truly, it is one that no one should miss.	2003-08-09

He is able to write non-fiction, that reads like fiction.  While he did have a little help with that, as every time I do read something that relates to Mormon history, it does seem like it is fiction, even the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; itself, reads like fiction.  While I will not make any commentary on the &quot;Book of Mormon,&quot; as I do not like to comment on other people's beliefs, Jon Krakauer's book, is just extraordinary and explains a goodly piece of Mormon history.  Jon does this, because it is necessary in order for the reader to understand the mindset that would allow someone to actually murder another, with no remorse or regret, because they truly believed that God had personally told them to do that.<br />The Mormon faith is unique in its concept, that all &quot;Saints&quot; which are good and right minded members of the Mormon Church, can communicate directly with God.  Also, Jon explicitly describes, defines and illustrates the difference between members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints which is distinctly different from members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  Before reading Jon's book, I did not really understand HOW different are the two sects.  But they are extremely different, even though they use the same theological material.<br />In his book, Jon does succeed in helping the reader actually internalize this feeling of &quot;Murder By God's Command.&quot;  His truly wonderful and clear, but not at all gory, description of the murders is excellent.  And the many personalities that Jon uses to describe the mindset is wondrous.  But one of the other things that Jon does, is to introduce each chapter with a quotation from some related piece of work.  This one is particularly of note:<br />&quot;Both revelation and delusion are attempts at the solution of porblems.  Artists and scientists realize that no solution is ever final, but that each new creative steppoints the way to the next artistic or scientific problem.  In contrast, those who embrace religious revelations and delusional systems tend to see them as unshakeable and permanent...<br />Religious faith is the answer to the problem of life ... The majority of mankind want or need some all-embracing belief system which purports to provide an answer to life's mysteries, and are not necessarily dismayed by the discovery that their belief system, which they proclaim as &quot;the truth,&quot; is incompatible with the beliefs of other people.  One man's faith is another man's delusion ...<br />Whether a belief is considered to be a delusion or not depends partly upon the intensity with which it is defended, and partly upon the numbers of people subscribing to it.&quot;<br />                              Anthony Storr, &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;<br />That in fact is what Jon Krakauer shows us in his magnificent book.  That a belief is a delusion, until many people accept it, and then it becomes an accepted belief, and no longer delusional in that present time.<br />There are between 10 to 11 million Mormons globally today.  That number seems significant enough to consider the mindset of the original doctrines and theology a belief.  Yet their seem always within almost all religions, groups of people who start to believe that the accepted beliefs, are not a precisely proper interpretation, for whatever reason.  This inevitably causes schisms within that religion, and so, new religions are either born, or die if abandoned by their followers.<br />The murders of Brenda Lafferty and her 18 month old daughter in 1984 are inexorably linked to religious belief.  And in addition, perhaps, to the subconscious desires of one of the murderers.  This book is almost a must read for anyone who wishes to understand the total sociology of American Religions.	2003-08-01

But I would note, that Grafton's commentary on Lincoln's composition of the Gettysburgh Address is in accord with the superb work of Gary Wills in his book, \\"Lincoln At Gettysburgh\\" where Wills thoroughly debunks the myth that Lincoln wrote the Address on the back of an envelope on his way up on the train.<br />Anyone who has frequent need to reference some of the greatest and enduring documents in American History will find this book an invaluable reference tool.	2003-07-27
US	52846971	R1T71PQSIORJLX	0810110490	274700893	Fateless	Books	5	6	7	N	N	To Hell And Back!	Imre Kertesz has truly created a masterpiece.  As indicated by his 2002 Nobel Prize for his life's work, the Nobel Committee thought so as well.  The book is written not using any extensive vocabulary.  Not once did I have to turn to the dictionary, yet, with his simple language, Kertesz brings a feeling and depth to the book, which is almost unique.  In many ways, it is reminiscent of Saramago and J. M. Coetzee in this respect, but Kertesz actually does it better.<br />The story of a 15 year old boy, Kertesz himself, from Hungary, who is unwittingly rounded up and sent to Auschwitz is truly unique.  Not only is the viewpoint unique, but the way he responded to the environment is extremely unique.<br />This is somewhat due to his naivete, which within a year would be totally gone, never to be recalled; but also to his ability to dissociate so effectively so as not to really feel the physical discomforts of his situation.  In addition, it is interesting to see so graphically, how one can go from total health to virtual death in just one year of exposure to the concentration camps.<br />Another almost unimaginable concept that Kertesz weaves into \\"Fateless\\" is an almost tangible feeling amongst concentration camp dwellers of \\"a longing for Buchenwald.\\"  At Buchenwald, conditions were so radically different, that mostly Jewish prisoners longed for the peace, serenity and benefits that Buchenwald had to offer in comparison to a camp such as Auschwitz/Birkenau, which had the sole purpose of extermination.  They were designed as extermination factories.  Not so with Buchenwald, at least not nearly in the same manner.<br />Early in the book, Kertesz introduces what he conceives as \\"Fatelessness.\\"  He is talking to a Jewish girl, and he comments that if she had been switched in the hospital, her whole life would be different.  The author characterizes and quotes her response as follows:<br />\\"With a crackling voice, she desperately shouted something to the effect that if our distintiveness was unimportant, then all this was mere chance, and that if there was the possibility of her being someone other than whom she was fated to be, then all this was utterly without reason, and to her that idea was totally \\"unbearable.\\"  Thus Kertesz really seems to be saying in accordance with that definition, All of us are fateless, regardless of religion, we could all be living a different life, and be a different religion, at the whim of a hospital orderly.  Thus, we are all \\"Fateless.\\"<br />In slightly less than 200 pages, Kertesz shows a mastery that is rare and intricate.  Yet not difficult to read, only slow to read, as the wording and each line is so important, that it takes attention and thought to understand his sentiment and feelings.  Yet, it is such an unusual perspective, that it is worth reading merely to see his viewpoint on perhaps the greatest manmade horror of all time.	2003-07-15

It is obviously written for mass market digestion, as he uses effusive foreshadowing that allows the reader to figure out the solutions to the plots and subplots well in advance of Brown revealing them.  However, the book is great fun to read.<br />When evaluating detective/mystery books, I always try to compare them to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes books, which really are the only books in this genre that I feel are truly literature in the classic sense.  Brown's book does not live up to that literary test, but it does live up to most other tests of what readers would consider a good read.<br />If you enjoy page turning mystery with a theological theme, this is truly a wonderful read.	2003-07-05

It just did not seem so exciting by the description.  Then one day I had to go on a plane, and I noticed, that the book had won the National Book Award.  I immediately bought it, and I was transfixed.<br />The amazing thing about Glass' writing is that it does not really matter what the subject is; but how she writes that is truly incredible.  Out of the box with her first book, the novel is gripping.  Not from suspense, but from the structure, the feelings, the emotions, the conversations and the narration.<br />Glass is quite the brilliant author and person.  What she conveys in this book are feelings that no one would even consider.  Feelings, that are so subtle, yet when she paints the picture with her profound and literary sentence structure, seem so clear, so obvious.<br />Her insight into mental transaction is acute; her analysis astute.  And her entire construction of the book is illuminating.  This book is a must read for all lovers of modern literature in fiction.	2003-06-16

He shows the constant strain of classical methods versus Modern creations in the constant tug and pull of the artist and the Metropolis.  The Purchasing Department of the metropolis holds the artist's fate in its hands as it decides what to buy and how to deal with the artist/vendor.<br />Not leaving it just there, the diametrically opposed views of life that are imposed in the metropolis versus in the pottery of the artist are most telling and indicative of society today.  In the metropolis, people have traded personal privacy, freedom and liberty to one degree or another, for safety and security.  While they are safe and secure, their whereabouts and their activities are always visible to the metropolis.  But they are safe.  So they trade their freedoms for this police state environment.<br />It is this analysis, the benefits versus the detriments of the metropolis versus the artist's life, that Saramago examines in this book.  The choices the characters make illustrate the author's preferences and also his concerns.<br />This book is a tremendously incisive look at the people and the rules.  For those interested in how we might live, this book is a must read.  While not as graphic and poignant as Saramago's Nobel Prize winner, &quot;Blindness&quot; it still gives one just as much to ponder about our future and our choices.  With excellent writing style and true emotionality of expression, this book is a truly fine piece of modern literature.	2003-06-16

Her descriptiveness is so complete and detailed, yet not in the least boring, that one is drawn back to the book until it is finished.  Annie shows real life on the Texas and Oklahoma panhandle, not just the scenery or a few characters, but the entire panarama and the true feelings, emotions and perceptions of those who spent generations in the panhandle.<br />Annie also does something that few authors do as well as she does.  She writes wonderful dialogue.  But not just plain old dialogue, but dialogue in dialect.  To do this with authenticism is very difficult, but Annie does it like it is just another note on the refrigerator.<br />Annie shows a true brilliance for modern day fictional literature and no one who has a love for the genre should go without reading this book, as well as her others.	2003-05-07

With aplomb that few have, Levi is able to give a rather full and moving description of his personal experience in Auschwitz and its surrounding camps.  Interesting is that he never makes a complaint, as there is no use to do so.  Even while in the worst possible imaginable human conditions, only survival has real value and lends motivation to go on.  In Auschwitz, all was just one long day, that ended either in surprise liberation, as did happen for some, or death, which did happen for most.<br />Levi was somewhat fortunate, and did not enter the death camps until late in the war.  His length of internment was part of what helped him survive.  Yet oddly, it was only a mere fraction of the whole system needed to survive under such conditions.<br />Ironically, Levi did eventually commit suicide, after becoming world renown as a writer.  While this is uncommon for Holocaust survivors, it is most predominant amongst writers, artists and poets.  But before leaving, Levi left us some of the finest examples of how to convey an unbelievable situation in a believable manner.  His work and his choice of verbiage is uncommonly artistic.  And the book gives the reader a very real and present understanding of just how the conditions really were.  As unbelievable as one can imagine, is in fact, how they were.	2003-05-05

Hamill is the son of an Irish immigrant and finds that the culture of drink is part of the culture of being a man.  However, he also watched his father, who was a fall down alcoholic through his life growing up, and thus recalled the pain it imposed on his family's life.<br />In the course of telling his story, Hamill reveals that he was a person who was constantly going from place to place, all over the world.  What exactly he is searching for, he never really reveals.  But eventually, he does come to grips with the fact that the Drinking Life is detrimental to his continued existence.<br />One of his greatest lines in the entire book is in his introduction when he states, &quot;But life doesn't get easier when you walk away from the culture of drink; you simply live it with greater lucidity.&quot;  The book is a fine example of someone who eventually realizes that life is &quot;better&quot; if not easier, without his addiction.  The book is an inspiring story and I recommend it to all observers of social behavior.	2003-04-09

Because the book is short stories, he is able to give different pictures and perspectives of the \\"Auschwitz Life\\" through the experiences of numerous inmates and incidents.<br />Incredibly, Borowski has a tremendously talented way of describing the virtually indescrible horror of the scene, without being grisly and gory.  But his point is so poignantly made with the book, that it is really almost a must read for those interested in just how horribly people can treat other people.<br />While suicide is very rare amongst Holocaust survivors, the ones who do commit it, have a very high percentage of authors, poets and artists.  These being the ones who felt the pain so deeply, that at some point, they could no longer live with what they had seen.  Sadly, Borowski did take his life, and perhaps ironically, he gassed himself to death.<br />Once the reader has read his rendition, it is easy to understand why he cannot live with what he saw anymore, and in fact, it is hard to understand sometimes why so many other Holocaust survivors don't take their own lives.<br />The book is beautifully written, almost poetic at times.  And it is hard to imagine anything about Auschwitz being poetic, but Borowski does manage to do it in this book.  I would recommend the book to anyone who really wants to get a picture of just how low humanity can sink in extreme conditions.	2003-04-09

In this book, Rosenbaum has captured some incredible reflection on the concept of suicide.  While the book is ostensibly about the Holocaust, wrapped in a fairy tale of kabbalistic spirituality, Rosenbaum's story, is only a vehicle.  It is the mode by which he transmits so many thoughts and feelings on why people should go on with life, philosophically, not just biologically.<br />Starting with several Holocaust survivors who committed suicide, Rosenbaum investigates the reasons why they might have done so.  One would think that after Auschwitz, Buchenwald or Bergen-Belson, life would be a virtual cakewalk.  Nothing could possibly be as bad as that again.<br />And as a general class, that is true.  Yet, there is a small component of Holocaust survivors, who eventually decide that they can no longer live with the memory of what they saw, and eventually take their own life.  And not surprisingly, a high percentage of them are artists, poets and writers, the people who would be most susceptible to feeling the pain of others and themselves.<br />In crafting his book, Rosenbaum illustrates many reasons to live.  And he equally poses many questions about life.  But in some respects, he does manage to find reasons to live, which are undeniable, if not difficult to accept sometimes.<br />As an added bonus, Rosenbaum's descriptions of midtown Manhattan are some of the best present day representations of the area I have ever read in my life.  Since he teaches at Fordham Law school, he would be quite familiar with 59th St. & Broadway.  The incredible precision of his pictures of Manhattan are truly picturesque and artistic.<br />Rosenbaum has succeeded in creating a truly wonderful work that handles difficult life subjects with great aplomb.  It is recommended to those who think about life and the meaning therein.	2003-03-22

I had not read her previous books, but nonetheless, no one wins the NBA and then writes trash after that, or at least, almost no one.<br />I was not at all disappointed.  While McDermott's plot line is a bit prosaic, the plot is not what is truly brilliant about this book.  McDermott takes the plot, and allows it to unfold through the eyes of a pretty, intelligent and 16 year old girl way out at the end of Long Island.<br />With a superb writing style, a truly wonderful sentence structure and an articulation that is simple but truly elegant, McDermott paints a vivid picture of a smart girl facing not so much the realities of life in coming of age, but much more, the Loss of Innocence.<br />In virtually every way, McDermott's protagonist loses her innocence in a span of about 3 weeks.  And yet, the book is subtly disguised as a sweet story about a young girl.  Only when the reader scrapes below the surface of McDermott's truly elegant prose, does the reader fully appreciate the message that is being conveyed.<br />It is with great praise, that I recommend this book to all readers of fine contemporary fiction.  The book is truly worthy of being classified as current modern literature.	2003-03-15

While it was known that life was difficult in China and all the more so under Mao Zedong, not until recently was it known to what extent; how things seemed almost pointless in so many ways.<br />The Revolution took on meaning for Mao in such a way as to try to purge the country of anything 'Western.'  But this book shows, that what he did was really nothing, with respect to what he wanted.  All he did was to rid the country of speaking about how people are people everyday and all of their lives.  <br />In a sense, we see much the same in Gao Xingjian's Nobel Prize winning &quot;Soul Mountain.&quot;  A journey is undertaken.  Many things are encountered, yet they are on such a basic and visceral level.  Probably because in most of China, that is all there is, abject poverty, party officials, and little villages clustered around mountains.<br />How different is the culture of those living in a primarily agrarian society than living in a 'virtual' society.  How the concept of making food for the day is no longer something people of the 'West' even consciously think about, mostly, they just think about getting it and eating it.  Here the reader is faced with a very different type of life, and a very different type of education or re-education as the case may be.<br />Whatever it may be, the objective of re-education was never realized, because the objective was to change human beings into something that they were not.  This attempt was bound to fail from the beginning.  And here we see another example of its failure.  Western literature reflects societal values and events.  They are human events.  They will happen in any society.  No attempt by any despot to change human nature will succeed.  Human nature can only be changed by humans, perhaps one person at a time, but not by anyone other than themselves.<br />Sijie's book makes that point poignantly, and with great aplomb.  The book is truly a terrific one, and it reads quickly, but it's point lingers long after the read is finished.  It is highly recommended.	2003-03-02

In so doing, she weaves a thrilling tale of modern biology mixed with page turning mystery that provides a terrific read for lovers of the genre.  Add to this, the backdrop of big money and power in Manhattan, and Ms. Lankford has succeeded in creating a wonderful tale, that presents a level of realism that is hard to match.<br />While one might find some of the elements of the story a little predictable, the intensity of feeling for which Ms. Lankford touches on the important issues of society allow the story to carry much more weight than just a regular mystery novel.  In this book, the author is able to create a feeling of \\"Virtual Mysticism\\" within the mind of the reader.  The implications of the book are so vast and all encompasing, that it provides for a terrific social commentary along with her story.<br />Mystery readers will not be disappointed by Ms. Lankford's book.  And if we are fortunate, Ms. Lankford will provide us with a sequel to this book, that would more fully round out the perspective she is trying to portray.  I would highly recommend this book to mystery lovers everywhere.	2003-02-26

In 1963, a college campus in Syracuse, N.Y.  This biographical reference leaves us little doubt as to where she refers.  Yet, the personal familiarity with the college and the region, allow her to talk about it in a way that conveys the specific characteristics that she needs to, in order to make her point, without the need to be verbose about the setting.<br />Not only is the book equisitely written, but it takes on a special character which never before has appeared in a Joyce Carol Oates novel.  In &quot;I'll Take You There&quot; Joyce has dedicated a special degree of attention to her prose.  The sentences flow as though they were water, effortlessly moving downhill into the reader's mind.  One sentence conflating to the next, without the slightest feeling of disjointedness.  While Oates takes poetic license in that all her sentences are not grammatically correctly formed sentences, this perhaps shows the influence and her love of the work of Donald Barthelme, who used glimpes, phrases, to create pictures for the reader.  But even more than that, the language is almost approaching the character of James Joyce, where the difference between prose and poetry is hard to distinguish.<br />Often accused in the past of whipping out new novels without the proper care and attention to classic literary detail, there are none that can say that about this book.  Here, with the backdrop of philosophy, religion, economics, race and gender, Joyce weaves a story that is so compelling and so real in character, that it is difficult to stop reading it once started.  In short, I would be compelled to &quot;Be Taken&quot; where she wishes to lead me.<br />In conclusion, there is not any serious reader of classic literature, who should pass up the opportunity to read this book.  Failure to do so, would be a lose of the enjoyment of real literary finesse.	2003-02-13

Ury calls his method the &quot;Breakthrough Strategy&quot; and is virtually totally as applicable for mediators as it is for negotiators.  In fact, several times, Ury mentions that a mediator may assist the process.<br />Simply put, Ury contends that there are basically 5 things that one needs to do to preserve smooth negotiations and to break through an impasse if it occurs.  He calls these 'steps' by the following designations:  &quot;Go To The Balcony&quot;, &quot;Step To Their Side&quot;, &quot;Reframe&quot;, &quot;Build Them A Golden Bridge&quot; and &quot;Use Power To Educate.&quot;  These simple concepts are extremely useful tools for negotiators and mediators alike.  <br />There is no disappointment in this book.  The approach and the writing style are just superb.  Once again, the Harvard Group, especially William Ury, have produced a book that anyone can gain from and is almost a must for those in dispute resolution and negotiation on a day to day basis.	2003-01-26

Almost radiating its fine contents the book immediately invokes a feeling of question just from the title.  But once inside, the reader finds an unexpectedly fine rendition in many hues.<br />The book is a collection of short stories, most of which have been previously published in other journals.  However, the particular selection of stories holds together in great harmony as a compilation.  Hegi has a talent for character development that rivals the greatest of short story writers.  In her stories in this book, all between about 5 and 22 pages, Hegi shows an ability that is truly impressive with respect to her proficiency in conveying the character of her story so sensitively and completely.<br />Hegi makes no secret of her German origin or its particular effect on the characters in the book, many of whom are German.  She has a pleasant style of using German words, but then immediately translating so no loss of meaning or understanding is felt by the reader.  Except in her occasional use of German profanity or a very close cognate, Hegi always provides the user with the German word's translation and does not use the effect too much that it becomes irritating, only as much as she needs, in order to add the flavor she is trying to convey.<br />As one of the outstanding authors writing in America today this work is a fine example of what can be done with precision and imagination.  This book is recommended to all lovers of fine and personal short stories.	2002-11-30

His plot is shockingly salient.  And his writing style and sentence structure is nothing less than superb.  In one of the most introspective novels of the modern day, Wright describes the plight of impoverished African Americans in Chicago in 1940.  With a plot that is riveting, Wright discloses to the reader a side of society that many people never have the opportunity to witness or directly observe.<br />With delicacy and aplomb, Wright illustrates how people with no hope of success in life can be brought to violent action not by design, but by impulse provided because of the deprivation that is imposed upon them by societal indiscretion.  The pervasive prejudice that was endemic in that period is graphically articulated by Wright's well chosen words.<br />What is most disturbing though, is how little society has changed in over 60 years.  While today, there are laws that protect minorities there still exists a plethora of prejudice against those who are not White Anglo Saxon Americans.  This anomaly is fueled by an unusual American xenophobia that still captures the minds of the unenlightened to a great degree.  While segregation is no longer a legal practice, it still seems to be the ever present and overarching character of all too many Americans.  It gives the reader pause to consider how many years must go by, before American society becomes racially neutral.  Even today, only the smallest percentage of African Americans succeed in achieving the quintessential &quot;American Dream.&quot;  To most, this opportunity is just not available.<br />Any reader who doubts that high level classic fiction can be created by modern authors will be swayed significantly by &quot;Native Son.&quot;  The book is recommended to every single American reader.  It is an experience that will not be soon forgotten.	2002-07-11

But that is where the positive stopped and the negative started.  The book is a picture of inner city life in Philadelphia from the slums and homeless perspective.  The plot is weak.  The character development is flimsy.  And the writing style is just one step above &quot;pot boiler&quot; mass market novels.<br />The book in no way can be labeled as literature.  It seems like a piece whipped off in an afternoon.  Very little depth to the characters and very low levels of description on just about any aspect of the book.  Even the dialogue seems less than realistic.  In fact, the only character in the book that was developed was that of the Schuylkill River, which the reader gets a pretty good feeling for throughout the book.<br />Otherwise, the reader's time would be infinitely better spent, reading &quot;Native Son&quot; by Richard Wright.  That is a modern day classic where the characters are well developed and really ring true.  If you truly feel a need to read Peter Rock's book, perhaps borrowing it from the library is better than spending the money to own it.	2002-06-29

She truly expresses what it is to be a professional author.  Her book is filled with anecdotes that are so truthful and real that the reader automatically relates to her comments and experiences.  She has fully achieved one of her objectives in getting her prose to &quot;ring true&quot; to the reader.<br />The author talks about how a person driven to be a writer can discipline themselves and develop a personal system to create work.  Her book makes comments on all the common problems that writers experience, including such things as writer's block, plot and character development and mental static.  Within all of this Ms. Lamott introduces a dose of reality, that could be seen as cynical, if she didn't have such a witty and personal way of relating it to the reader.<br />The book is filled with instructive advice on writing and life and serves to draw the reader in to the author's life, by cathartically experiencing or re-experiencing one's own personal life events.  Not only does Ms. Lamott give people a reason to write, but she also answers the question once and for all, can someone teach another how to write better work?

With this book, Lovenheim makes a far reaching contribution to all aspiring mediators and to the field itself.  In one of the most realistic portrayals I have ever read, the book clearly illustrates with precision, the expectations a person should have when making the decision to choose mediation as a career.  Lovenheim does not make the assumption that the reader is a knowledgeable person in the field in any way.  He begins at the beginning, explaining what Mediation is all about.<br />Following that introduction, the book proceeds to explain what general types of personality traits contribute to success as a mediator.  Mr. Lovenheim also wisely points out, that some formal training in mediation is extremely highly advised.  And he explains why this training is essential and what one gains through taking the time and expense of gaining that education.<br />The book goes even further than just discussing the practice and profession of a Mediator.  Astutely, Lovenheim realizes that not all people are in the position to become mediators, particularly for financial reasons, if not for other reasons.  However, even those who are not able to be mediators, may wish to be involved in the mediation or dispute resolution field.  Lovenheim guides such individuals with particularly illustrative detail, toward ways that one can do so, and yet not take the risk of becoming a full time mediator.<br />With excellent references listed in his appendices, Lovenheim gives a lot to the reader.  Any person considering becoming a mediator would be extremely well advised to take the time to read Peter Lovenheim's book.	2002-05-27

Through the eyes, ears and voice of the protagonist the book portrays a sense of relatedness of all things and people in the world.  And, yet, at the same time, portrays the difficulty of life's vicissitudes.  But throughout, the book shows the reader, that each person can truly make a difference to others in this world.  By starkly illustrating how one person's enlightened presence can have a profound effect on those around them, the reader soon realizes that Stollman does more than just tell a story.  He scratches off the surface, and reaches deeply into the thoughts and feelings of young Joseph, as he develops an insight and depth of feeling for a person, that he has only known for a very short time.  Yet this brief acquaintance changed Joseph and his character for the rest of his life.<br />Stylistically, Stollman presents a rather wondrous mix of temporal wanderings.  The story switches from the present life, to the past life of Joseph.  The alternation between the two time frames within his life, further enhances the reader's ability to draw these conclusions and to clearly envision how  this brief encounter with one other person, who has a depth of feeling and understanding far surpassing the average human being, can make an indelible impression on the thought patterns of others.  Using a style that is easy to read, yet highly thought provoking, Stollman achieves a synergy between the mundane day-to-day world and the ephemeral spirituality that exists within each person.  Contained within this synergy is a new way of thinking, which in turn leads to a new way of life.  It enhances the ability of people to perceive the inner feelings of not only oneself, but also of others.  If the reader follows Stollman's portrayal of this transformative experience, one can learn and understand not only ones own inner feelings, but in addition, onecan increase their sensitivity to the feelings and presence of people and things that exist all around us.  <br />Finally, the story elucidates how just one act by a person, can change the entire direction of that person's future.  This change can be both positive and negative simultaneously.  Yet, through this act, an individual can redirect the entire activities of one's life with respect to the act.  In Stollman's own words, \\"Anything you have ever seen or heard or held in your hand changes you forever.  When we encounter each other, we become part of each other.\\"  Once done, this process cannot be undone.  The book is highly recommended for anyone seeking further inner understanding and peace.  Through the book one can learn how a soul can be truly illuminated and revealed by the manner in which one approaches life and acts.  It allows the reader to truly empathize with one's inner self and thus, increase self-understanding many fold.	2002-05-14

The protagonist is a girl from the privileged White South African Bourgeois, who was virtually surrounded by privilege and opportunity.  At least that is how it seems to an immigrant from a poor Islamic country in Europe.  And, yet, unlikely as it would seem, she falls in love with this immigrant who is working as a garage mechanic.  Having been raised in a more enlightened age in Modern South Africa, it does not seem inappropriate to either her or her bohemian friends at the Café/Restaurant that she frequents for her to do so.  <br />He has hopes that his involvement with her will help him stay in the country, which is trying to expel him, but he did not initially intend to fall in love.  His vision is one of success that looks so sweet from outside the capitalist economies of the world, but can be so elusive once one enters within.  Her vision seems yet to be developed.  She has a job, which could be done in most parts of the world.  She is an educated girl.  And yet, she finds herself, through her own choice transported to the world of the desert; a world without computers and supermarkets.  True, there is some electricity and there are cell phones and TV's, but not too much else in the way of modern day amenities, including a lack of running water.  But there is always what becomes a strange allure of the desert around her.  <br />With technique that is nothing short of brilliant, Gordimer renders a tale of rejection of values from all sides.  The man is rejecting the values of his homeland, and the woman is doing likewise, but neither knows truly what they seek at the end of their journey.  The interplay of cross-cultural interaction is deeply conveyed within the text.  The richness of communication, between people who speak more non-verbally, than with words is portrayed with particular alacrity.  Many of the deepest thought processes are left for the reader to understand by inference.  And the solutions to problems in the journey are particularly uniquely resolved.  The book is truly a modern day piece of literature.	2002-04-22

Existentialism is usually defined as \\"a philosophy that views the individual as being a unique entity, alone and isolated in an indifferent and even hostile universe\\" or something similar, the book alters this description.  Rather than being totally alone, one is almost totally alone, and rather than the universe being totally hostile, it is somewhat or mostly hostile.  In fact, Sebald paints a picture of a person lost within himself and within the world around him.  <br />Austerlitz does not feel so much unique, as he feels unaware, unclear and out of touch with his real self and where he comes from.  And, this feeling is not surprising considering his past transplantation from a warm and happy family life to a cold and non-communicative, even sterile environment, at the tender age of 4 years.  He feels constantly displaced, which in fact, he truly is.  Yet in contrast to the cold and hostile environment of such authors as Kafka or Camus, Austerlitz encounters a basically indifferent environment that has pockets of caring and love.  It is a dichotomy that Sebald creates for the character and the reader.  How can it be, that there is caring and love, yet the world is mostly indifferent and uncaring toward the individual?  But it is reflective of the real world in many tangible ways.<br />Additionally, Sebald's rolling sentence structure is unique and exhilarating.  His sentences go on at length, with single sentences sometimes running more than 2 pages.  Yet his clarity is always maintained.  His use of paragraphs is sparse.  A single paragraph can run for 40 or 50 pages.  He utilizes new paragraphs only for major changes in the scenario or subject of discussion.  It is a masterful construction that must be read to be fully comprehended.  The book is recommended for all readers interested in modern day classic literature.	2002-02-24

Overtly referencing D.H. Lawrence, one of the fathers of the genre, and one of Oates favorite writers, the book leads the reader through the mind of a young college coed, who to one extent or another, becomes lost and obsessed in the world of human feeling and sexuality, even depraved sexuality.<br />The tale is highly autobiographical, and it is interesting to try and separate the fictional Joyce from the real one.  Her love of D.H. Lawrence and literature in general, mixed with the college campus atmosphere with which she is so familiar.  The exquisite detail of the anorexic condition which Joyce has been a victim of personally, along with her tachycardia.  All these things, combined with emotions portrayed in a manner, that is purely unique to Joyce's work.  <br />Yet, not uncommonly, Joyce ends with the death or murder of some of her characters.  This situation is not unusual for her.  It is the manner in which the protagonist is drawn to create this conclusion that makes the book so precisely a Joyce Carol Oates novel, or perhaps it should better be called a novella.  Running only 138 pages, the book does not give us the extreme level of character development that many of her books do.  Yet, somehow, she is able to paint a truly clear and tangible, even palpable feeling of her protagonist and the mental processes that she experiences.  Perhaps, drawing heavily on self experiences is the key to her wonderful articulation in such a limited number of words.  <br />For those who are familiar with her work, this book will not be a disappointment.  Interestingly, she portrays women as the Beasts here, which is not typical, yet also not atypical of her Gothic style.  Even her supporting characters have various, unclean and often nefarious intent.  Yet she focuses the reader on the central character, which in many ways, is herself.  In her style,she is the undisputed master, and this book is no exception.  It is highly recommended for readers of Gothic tales, and any reader of Joyce Carol Oates will find this book one of great illustrative significance.	2002-01-29

By chance I bought &quot;The Road To Los Angeles&quot; only to find out that it was in fact Fante's first book.  The book seems to have been considered to racey to be published in 1936 when he first wrote it, but it was discovered in manuscript by his wife after his death in 1983.  She had the book published in 1985.  <br />By reading it, I found that Arturo Bandini was first created by Fante as a 20 year old, working in a California cannery.  His depiction of the life of Bandini, an aspiring young author, seems, in part to be autobiographical.  And, yet, it is clear why Fante chose to go backwards in the life of Bandini, when he wrote his second book, &quot;Wait Until Spring.&quot;  In Bandini chronology, the second book takes place before the first book and greatly explains from whence Bandini came.<br />&quot;Road To LA&quot; is a fabulous example of the vicissitudes of the mental processes of an aspiring young author.  Bandini sees himself as a great author, yet the book shows the huge pendulous vacillations between an almost meglomaniacal belief in his own greatness to a totally insecure feeling of being just a mediocre hack.  <br />The book does a splendid job of portraying a life representing the beginning of a profession which is often a &quot;Dangerous Profession.&quot;  Clearly, this precariousness is elucidated by Fante, as he shows just how easy it is to be almost on the edge of madness.  It is most illustrative of how an author must be faced with the interpretation of human thought processes, as he works to put meaning into his work.  And, not only meaning that is personal, but meaning that will be of value to those who may read his work.<br />While I would not recommend the book as the first foray for any reader into Fante's work, it is surely one that any reader who is interested in Fante's fascinating portrayals should find the time toread, as it takes one step further, toward the development of his character, and to the development of an author.	2002-01-12

Here is a family, a proud Italian American unit, that is hard working, religious, and proud of their heritage and themselves.  Yet, they live with a day to day level of impovershment that is striking to most people in today's American society.  It is difficult for one to imagine harder times in their own personal life, than what Fante has depicted in this work.<br />In addition, Fante develops the interactions of his charcters with a true expertise, that allows the reader to quickly read his book and still get all the value and meaning contained therein.  Fante's characters are believable and realistic.  The manner in which they represent their positions is only too reminiscent of almost all family life in America.  The lessons that he imparts are truly inspirational and timely for those who have been through some hard times and difficult life situations.<br />While Fante deals with a serious marital transgression, he does so with great aplomb.  His ability to portray the inner perspective of his characters from all sides of the issue is fabulous.  And, in the end, even the transgressor sees himself with pride and honor, in the face of victimization by one who can easily manipulate him for her own self-indulgence.<br />Fante's book is a truly wonderful piece of work.  It is a great life lesson for all who may take the time to read it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to be more in touch with the world around them, and with the way in which the world can change, in only a few minutes.  A truly great piece of work.	2002-01-09

Lankford's book stands out like a shining star in the plethora of mystery thrillers that fill the shelves of bookstores and the files of cyberspace.  As a first effort of publication, Lankford produced a highly engaging and gripping novel.  With just the right mix of popular culture and detective work, the book grabs the reader from the first 20 pages, and does not let go.<br />In a combination of technological abstraction and mystery/thriller authorship, it is reminiscent of Crichton's \\"Andromeda Strain\\" in many ways.  A true computer fanatic finds himself embroiled in a triple murder case, that through the use of sheer mental logic combined with computer creativity, turns out to be a serial murder case that takes the reader for a terrific cyber-ride.  And, not only does Lankford's style entrance the reader, but she also has a sensitivity to the emotional interplay of human beings, that is often lacking in modern day thriller mysteries.  The true human nature of her characters is graphically depicted throughout her work.  She has succeeded in combining aspects of humanity that are rare in such works of fiction.<br />With great creativity, the story weaves its way through the murders like a fine thread through the eye of a small needle.  The reader is not able to make a quick jump to the conclusion that is ultimately spelled out by the book.  One finds themselves truly engaged throughout the almost 400 pages in a way that is uncommonly gratifying for a work of its type.  When the truth is finally revealed, one feels perhaps a bit like Archimedes, when he got into the bath and the water that spilled over gave him the answer to how to figure out whether the king's crown was truly made of pure gold.  The answer to Archimedes problem was \\"displacement.\\"  In Lankford's story, the answer is that all things are related, nothing happens by accident.<br />If there is anything that is slightly less than terrific about the book, the last 60 pages are somewhat predictable.  But, not so much that the reader is able to disengage and say they know the end, before they get there.  For readers who are detective and thriller enthusiasts, this book is truly worth the time and effort, which is minimal, as the book paces quickly and yet, does not lose the reader in simplicity as so many other thrillers of today do.  My most fervent congratulations are tendered to Ms. Lankford for her first work, and I look forward with enthusiasm to her upcoming works.  I think she has made a significant contribution to a genre that sometimes seems stale and unrealistic in the work of so many current day authors.  The reader will find the book totally refreshing.  Bravo!	2002-01-05

Here they choose amongst many contenders this year, Naipaul's work, which is perhaps only half-clear, even to the most exposed and insightful readers.  The book starts with Willie, the main character, a product of a &quot;half-breed&quot; Indian marriage.  His mother a low caste untouchable, who his father a Brahmin married in what appears to be a rejection of the life of his father and the casting off of the Indian system of arranged marriages and castes.<br />Willie then chooses to go to London, and get an education, but we find him to be so naive in the ways of the world, that he again, only seems to be half a youth in what seems to him a strange and incomprehensible City, only a small piece of which he takes in during his stay while attending university there.<br />In almost a panic, he decides that he knows not what he will do with his life after his college days end, and the college will ask him to leave the dorm, so he marries a women from Mozambique, an estate owner who herself is a &quot;half-bred&quot; woman, a cross between a pure Portuguese father and an African mother.  For 18 years, Willie spends his life in relative comfort, but without much of a contribution and much of a life.  The first 10 years or so of his life seem to consist of a vapid existence on the estate of his wife.  He is merely the male presence that helps to give his wife her status in a strange and half-real society.<br />About 11 years through all this half-life, he starts to have sexual adventures, the likes of which he has never experienced before, not with any women, not even with his wife, with whom he is very close.  Yet, the sexual adventures, while exhilerating to him, seem to leave him only half-satisfied.  That is, they excite him, but the meaning seems elusive to him, it seems only ephemeral sexual interaction.<br />Then he finds himself entranced with the wife of the estate manager of a neighboringestate.  She herself, seems only half-developed, and has a feeling of uselessness, married to a alcoholic husband who is a strange and unusual character.  Though she has had some affairs before, she is attracted in a magnetic way to Willie, as is he to her.  They have a rather intense sexual relationship, which again leaves both of them only half satisfied.  This affair ends when the husband of the wife almost dies after going on an alcoholic bender, and she devotes the remainder of her life to his care, and the care of her new house, next to the estate that her husband manages.<br />In the end, Willie decides that he must divorce his wife of 18 years and move to Germany to live with his sister.  But, he seems to decide this because he has come to the half-way point of his life, and has only lived in fact, &quot;half a life.&quot;  He knows not where he has gone, nor where he is going.  The only things that seemed real to him were the sexual interactions, that in the end seemed only half-real.<br />The last line of the book, illustrates perhaps the penultimate &quot;half&quot; item of the story.  His wife is returning a comment of Willie's in which he says that he has really only lived her life and not his own.  She says to him, &quot;Perhaps it wasn't really my life either.&quot;  All through the book, Naipaul gives us &quot;halves&quot; of everything.  It is fortunate to most of us that we have at least three quarters of a life, in comparison to the one illustrated by him in this book.  But, it certainly creates a story which inspires one to reflect upon the life that they have lead, and decide whether in fact, they feel like it has been one that has been at least a bit more than &quot;half a life.&quot;  Readers will find that this challenges them to evaluate their life and compare it to that of Willie as he tries to figure out where and how he should fit into a difficult world.  It is a piece of fine literature, worth reading and worth serious consideration inevaluating one's own contribution and experience in life.	2002-01-01

Living in wartorn London during the Second World War, his school life was filled with horror and pain.  But the young Sacks retreated mentally into a world of mathematics, chemistry and physics.  From Fibonacci mathematical series to the history of the building of the periodic chart of the elements, Sacks describes not only the discoveries of chemists from Newton through Nils Bohr, but also his incredible empirical chemical experiments.  He reveals some basic chemical facts, known truly only to real chemists, despite what basic chemistry one might have had in school, his revelations are truly breathtaking and amazing in some cases.<br />And as he describes his experiences with life and chemistry, he also tells of the uncertainty that is generated by the search for certainty and stability.  While never actually mentioning it by name, he does reference Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which says that one can know either the velocity or the position of an electron orbiting a atomic nucleus, but one can never know both simultaneously.  In many ways it was this uncertainty and Einstein's theory of relativity, that in effect says that everything is relative to your particular frame of reference, that made Sacks progress from his fascination with science and mathematics into a new real world of Biology and Medicine.  But, although the discoveries of the great physicists of the 1920's introduced tremendous uncertainty, that is, matter is both a particle and a wave, electrons are never totally predictable and radioactive substances deteriorate at a precise rate, whose half life can be specifically determined, but that precision does nothing to predict exactly the fate of any specific atom.  Each atom's existence is determined virtually by chance in a radioactive substance and each can last for a fraction of a second or for 100 million years, until the event that causes it to finally deteriorate actually occurs.  Those selfsame discoveries do in fact, lend stability to life in their instability.<br />Forever after, Sacks would be influenced in his life by those early experiments and discoveries, as well as what he learned by reading about the discoveries of others.  And, even to this day, he still sees the world in terms of those early concepts of chemistry, which so infused his boyhood with meaning and substance.  A tremendous work, recommended to anyone who has a curious mind and a yearning for finding the meaning of existence.	2001-12-25

In a departure from the more structured models of mediation presented in the past, these authors introduce a revolutionary approach to the manner in which mediation is approached.<br />Their theory basically shows conflicts in light of the &quot;life discourse&quot; that people bring to the dispute.  The application of &quot;Narrative Mediation&quot; is embodied in the concept, that it is the &quot;story of how the conflict developed&quot; from all parties perspective that is the MOST relevant factor in the deconstruction of the actual underlying issues which make up the conflict presented in each case.  The mediator's role, is to allow the parties to describe these factors and through their stories, to reveal their personal positions and their personal influences of their lives that have created the situation and also, give commentary, albeit often unwittingly, as to the manner in which an &quot;Alternative Story&quot; can be developed, that will allow those parties to reconstruct a relationship and a resolution.<br />While it is certainly true, that the method suggested by Winslade and Monk in their book is more effective when the parties will have an ongoing relationship, it still represents a new and fresh look at the ways in which mediators help facilitate the solutions to the presenting problems.  Even though the method seems more suited for such things as continuing employee/employer relationships or the aftermath of divorce, many of the topics covered still have tremendous value and application, even in cases, such as EEOC sexual harassment or constructive or wrongful discharge situations, that seem at least on the surface to be a purely &quot;needs based&quot; type of negotiation, where the parties never want to see each other ever again, post settlement.<br />Regardless of the type of mediation or ADR a practitioner is involved in, this book represents an extremely valuable insight into a new potential approach to mediation of conflict.  The book is recommended for all people in general, but particularly for those involved in resolution of conflict on any level and in any venue.  The book is a valuable contribution to the growing library of material on the topic of conflict resolution and should be carefully read and integrated as part of any ADR practitioners skill set.	2001-10-28

Yet, Busch has a talent shown by only a few present day short story writers.  His ability to convey human feeling and emotion with the most elegant constructions is clearly demonstrated with this collection.  <br />The intensity with which Busch presents his emotionality is enhanced by his incredibly insightful portrayal of the processes of the human mind.  His stories are so rich with the deepest of our hidden thoughts that they become almost palpable.  In these stories, Busch portrays highly intelligent people working with personal intimacies that are highly personal, yet so universal at the same time.<br />Particularly attractive is his &quot;novella&quot; in the book, &quot;Handbook For Spies.&quot;  Not only is the story captivatingly well written, but it is a virtual social commentary beyond the basics of the plot he lays out.  In addition, his implication seems to be, that in one way or another, we are all 'spies' in some sense or another, or at least we act like them.  In an editorial moment, his comment that Philip Roth is &quot;careless about his character's lives ... he's frivolous about them...&quot; portrays an unusually striking ability for Busch to develop his characters in a more mature emotional manner than he feels that Roth does.  <br />Any person who enjoys the short story genre will not be disappointed by this book by Busch.  For those with a high level of sensitivity toward human introspection, this book is a true revelation.	2001-10-17

Here Coetzee depicts the frivolous and capricious nature of the continuing war machine in the backdrop of 1970's South Africa.  The book, in its nature was very reminiscent of George Orwell, in such tales as &quot;Shooting An Elephant&quot; where the life of a civil servant and the attrocities he must perform and witness shape the personality and thought patterns of the man.<br />Here, Coetzee highlights the true cruelty that humanity can inflict upon other humans in its pursuit of whatever seems to be the right thing as determined by those in power at any particular point in time.  It need not make sense, it need not be morally defensible, it only need be possible and performable, and it may be done.  In the regime at the time, such was the situation, South Africa, like so many other places has been a war torn place for a very long time.  <br />In making his point, Coetzee puts together one of the finest sentences I have ever seen on paper, when he says this as the protagonist walks away from a senseless torture scene, &quot;Let it at least be said, if it ever comes to be said, if there is ever anyone in some remote future interested to know the way we lived, that in this farthest outpost of the Empire of light there existed one man who in his heart was not a barbarian.&quot;  The poignancy of that statement is deeply moving especially in these times in America.  The ability of Coetzee to capture so distinctively and so personally the despair that is illustrated and experienced, and truly suffered by one in the position that his protaganist is in, is the greatness of Coetzee.  To be able to transmit that feeling to his readers, as is his style, is his mastery.  All sensitive readers should spend the time to consume this mere 157 page book, which gives at least 600 pages of expressiveness.  Another fine piece of literature from a modern day master.	2001-09-30
US	52846971	RUSZ8FN20RDUN	1565122984	249962399	The Song of the Earth	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Just Around The Corner	In this book, Nissenson has transcended to a new plane of current fiction.  Not only is the subject matter bold, daring and temporally topical, but the treatment of the subject matter and the stylilistic aspects of the book, make this my selection for leading candidtate for the National Book Award this year.<br />The book, written in an epistolary style, which usually means letters, but in this case, are much closer to an &quot;e-mail&quot; format than a letter format.  The style allows Nissenson to be alternatingly personal and intense versus removed and obscure, from message to message, giving him amazing stylistic versatility, which he utilizes to great advantage.<br />Additionally, the book is a &quot;multi-media&quot; piece in that it mixes the media of written text with artistic visual creations and the use of &quot;e-mail&quot; as an expositional vehicle all in one piece of literature, which he then uses to give the reader an extrapolation of what is to come just around the corner in today's society.  Today cloning has just started.  Tomorrow, there will be science that allows us to change &quot;congenitally deleterious&quot; genetic problems, but what other detrimental effects might those &quot;genetic corrections&quot; contain, and might those horrible effects be only known after 100 or 1000 generations?  These are in fact the questions that we will have to wrestle with and who is to say, which is an 'OK' genome change and which is not legal?  <br />As if this were not enough, Nissenson, may even be prescient in detecting the growing polarization of men and women in today's society.  Not only are the viewpoints of these two necessary groups polarizing, but even the issue of self-sexual identity is becoming a problem for people in society today, no less 50 to 100 years from now.  Nissenson leaves no issue unaddressed and all serious modern literature readers should look to read this book, just to keep current with issues, if not for Nissenson's incredible craftsmanship.	2001-08-22

Previous translations of Moliere's work pale by comparison to Wilbur's brilliant translations.  It was my feeling, that would Moliere by alive today, and writing in American English, he would write the way Wilbur translated it.  <br />In comparison to prose translations in the past, Wilbur, past US Poet Laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner, truly gives the reader the real feeling of Moliere's &quot;Balletic Comedy&quot; style, as Moliere used his poetry and comedy to make complex and serious points about life of &quot;regular&quot; people, as opposed to royalty such as Shakespeare concentrated on, and so many other playwrites of the past.  <br />In reading Wilbur's translations, one can virtually imagine the cast prancing and mincing across the stage as they humorously render these rhyming couplets at each other, and the audience.  The true genius of both Moliere and Wilbur is illustrated most profoundly and strikingly in these translations.  Any true lover of Moliere, and even those who have never read him before, should treat themselves to Wilbur's translations for a Moliere experience, that is unparalleled in any other versions previously published.	2001-08-11

In her latest book, &quot;Faithless:  Tales of Transgression&quot;, Joyce once again shows her readers her virtuosity in the mastery of the short story.  While the book is a compilation of stories relating to &quot;transgressions&quot; the manner of selection and the juxtaposition of the tales within the book is masterful in and of itself.  Not only does Joyce deal with transgressions of marital fidelity, but she captures the essence of other transgressions.  Those against oneself.  Those against others not our lovers.  Those against family members.  And those of society against its people.<br />Joyce's articulation of the mental processes and logic of the transgressor and the transgressed provides a window into the &quot;existential human experience&quot; the likes of which are only rivaled by such authors as Camus, Kafka and Sartre.  The book is constructed to take the reader from self-transgressions all the way through the entire spectrum to perhaps the ultimate societal nightmare, the &quot;faithlessness&quot; of those sworn to &quot;protect and serve&quot;, the police forces of the country and specifically those of New Jersey.  <br />Joyce makes very little attempt to hide the venue of her stories, and by doing so, she makes them even more personal.  Yet, her manner of writing and her incredible acumen and sensitivity allow her to write the stories in such a way as to make them timeless and placeless, so that the reader comes to understand that these things could be happening in any place, in any town, in their own backyard.<br />The book is perhaps the finest compilation of stories to come out this year and perhaps will remain so until the end of this year.  The book is a must read for any serious literature fans who wish to increase their personal understanding of the deep and often secret workings of the inner mind of the transgressor and how the logic of such a mind can bring virtually any person to the point of committing the most unspeakable crimes, yet Joyce does speak of them, in a manner as eloquent as any ever set down on paper.  The book is a highly recommended read and serious lovers of literature should indulge themselves by partaking in this fabulous collection.	2001-07-30
US	52846971	RASSSZRW9ZIWV	0393040216	37432183	Passionate Marriage: Sex, Love, and Intimacy in Emotionally Committed Relationships	Books	5	65	71	N	Y	REVOLUTIONARY THEORY:  Sex &amp; Intimate Communication	This book represents a milestone in both the fields of marital therapy and sex therapy.  While it is not known or generally realized by most people, sex therapy and marital therapy have developed as separate disciplines with a totally different set of theoretical concepts and methods.  In this book, which is based on Schnarch's first book, &quot;The Sexual Crucible&quot;, Schnarch dares to suggest that in fact, one's sex life might actually improve if one's marital life improves.<br />And, further, he notes that this improvement in both the marital life and the sex life is not dependent on either one, but is in fact, a function of the &quot;self-differentiation&quot; of the individual person himself.  This does not belie the present day concepts of both marital therapy and sex therapy totally, but it does mostly.  Schnarch beautifully demonstrates to the reader, in a &quot;lingo&quot; that is very vernacular in nature, suitable for any enlightened reader to grasp his meaning, how the search for personal self-definition and identity, in fact allows one to relate in a deeper and more meaningful way to the one to whom you have made a lifetime commitment.  In fact, most of the concepts in Schnarch's book may be able to be generalized to most any relationship.  That is to say, that people who are more self-assured, self-developed, and/or &quot;self-differentiated&quot;, to use Schnarch's term, can communicate in more effective and meaningful manners.  If one sees sexual intimacy as a manner of intimate communication, more than just a process of procreation, then it only follows logically that a more &quot;self-differentiated&quot; person, or better yet, two of them together, can communicate in a manner not heretofore experienced in the sexual forum.<br />Schnarch takes this to its conceptual limits by outright stating that two people who are deeply committed to one another can reach a state, almost bordering Nirvana, if not there itself, through sexuality.  In a sense, Ifelt the book represented a reading of D.H. Lawrence for the unititiated, in that Lawrence preached and wrote about physical, spiritual, emotional and intellectual renewal through sexual intimacy.  In his book, Dr. Schnarch takes &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover&quot; from the ephemeral to the mundane, and then back again.  While a true reading of this book can create a window upon oneself that is not always pretty, the point of Schnarch's concept is to promote growth.  Any person who has experienced intense personal growth realizes that it comes with a price, and the price is often highly emotional.  I would highly recommend the book to anyone looking to find a more meaningful balance to their lives, particularly people who believe they have a good marriage, as this book will only serve to enhance that feeling and bring that communication to new pinnacles of intimacy.	2001-07-08

In this book, Joyce continues her investigatory writing on two main themes that are ubiquitous in her &quot;Rosamond Smith&quot; books.  These two themes being:            The Mental Processes Of Serial Killers                         AND            Identical Twins<br />Joyce is fascinated by the telepathic interactions of identical twins.  This has been heavily documented, both scientifically and empirically and Joyce interweaves the concept into her plot with great aplomb in this book.  Additionally, the book is reminiscent of &quot;Zombie&quot;, but in a more ordered and mass market style of writing.  While this seems to have been Joyce's original intent writing under this Nom De Plume, this minor charade seems now to have been all but abandoned as the first edition now lists the author as Joyce Carol Oates writing as Rosamund Smith.  Marketing wins in the end.<br />Nonetheless, the book represented an elevation of literary style when writing under her &quot;Rosamond Smith Cloak&quot; now that it has been exposed to reveal below, 'The Invisible Writer' hiding behind the &quot;Wizard of Oz's Curtain.&quot;  Perhaps this shall herald a new area for Joyce to develop yet another literary expertise.  <br />I would highly recommend the book to any suspense novel enthusiasts, and of course, to all Joyce Carol Oates readers around the world.	2001-06-17

Coetzee again produces a masterpiece of human feeling and emotion.  Using his native South Africa as the backdrop of his book, he relates the mental processes of a white women dying of cancer in 1980's South Africa.  While South Africa is in many ways a civilized country, it is in many ways very much third world, at least in the 1980's when apartheid was still the &quot;law of the land.&quot;  <br />As Coetzee's protaganist slowly expires, she uses an epistolary technique, the book is a long letter, to her daughter, who has escaped the daily horror of a gruesome war, by traveling to America.  The book illustrates graphically, the culmination of the abuse of a huge majority, simply because of the color of their skin.  While Coetzee's protaganist finds the concept of apartheid anathema, she has lived her life in the isolated world of the white of South Africa.  In these last days, she comes face to face with the reality of the rest of South Africa.  And, her reaction intensifies, as her emotion follows, through the final days of her life.<br />This book is highly recommended to those who wish to experience the true feelings and horror that affect those involved in day to day combat, 'on the streets where you live.'  Coetzee characterizes feelings and mental processes in a way that is truly outstanding.  It is a very worthwhile venture to read this book from Coetzee.  It is not time spent in vain.	2001-06-01

In &quot;Cleo Coconino&quot; Ms. Santoro has created a work of pure emotional communication.  Not only is the book creatively written and inspiring in its articulation of the feelings and emotions behind the author's meaning, but it additionally is graphically and visually a beautiful piece of work.  For much of the book, the direction of the 'journey', if you will, is not clear.  Until, the author starts tells the reader she began to cry.  And, at that point, the direction is most intimately revealed.<br />As in most good works of literature, it is the manner in which the message is communicated that puts the book into the superior category.  This quality embodied within the book that takes hold of the reader's own emotions and allows the reader to vicariously live through the experience as the author did, raises the caliber of the book to one which embodies a special uniqueness and beauty. <br />Finally, it cannot be overlooked that the book is layed out and augmented by the fact that the words, type styles and placement of the characters on the page also serve to help the meaning of the book come through to the reader.  Reminiscent of E.E. Cummings in this style, the layout vastly enhances the spirit and meaning of the book as it increases the transmission of the author's meaning and feelings.<br />In conclusion, I would recommend this book to any person who wishes to consider how one can look within oneself and through a combination of following one's own instincts and thoughtful introspection, a person can HEAL their own pain, no matter how old that wound may be, if one comes to grips with the source of the pain and anguish and follows one's own heart to the resolution within one's own mind and soul.	2001-05-22

Through Oates' depiction of Monroe's life, one can truly start to understand at least how Oates' sees the inner pathways of Monroe's thought patterns.<br />Oates seems to project the image of an actress who is a &quot;natural&quot;, one who is defined by the parts that she plays.  But, interestingly, although she can play a part, as though it was her real life, it is her real life that is destructive to her and it seems as though Marilyn has no true personality of her own, but in fact, lives vicariously through the roles of the characters that she played.<br />Additionally, Oates is able to slip in a very graphic description of the movie business, especially in the 50's and 60's.  At that time, women actresses were exploited in ways that would clearly be labeled as heinous sexual harassment today, although, it is likely that one version or another of the same type of behavior is exhibited in Hollywood even in the 21st Century.<br />Once again, Joyce shows her ability to get inside a person's mind and allow that person's introspection to flow out onto the pages that she writes.  To illustrate Oates puts this thought into young girl Marilyn's mind (Norma Jean at the time), &quot;... because with movie eyes, aesthetics takes on the authority of ethics.  To be less than beautiful is sad, but to be willfully less than beautiful is immoral.&quot;  Thus does Norma Jean observe, that beauty and appearance is everything, and that only her incredible vivacity, her amazing diaphanous existence and her incredible empathetic role assumption makes Monroe one of the most illustrious and talented actresses of all time.  But, along with this fame, came a terrible price, one that Oates well describes as Monroe's basic struggle with life and what it is she wanted out of it.  It is probable, that Marilyn never really knew what she wanted out of life, but she certainly left a legacy for all to see.<br />As with virtually all of Oates' books, this one draws the reader into the depths of the mind of the character, and allows one to understand the outrageousness of their behaviour, because the reader is in the mind of the character and feels that character's reactions and emotions.  While Oates obviously is speculating on the precise conversations that Marilyn had with herself, Oates has an ability to capture and extrapolate what is very likely to be a significant portion of the thought process of her characters.  If you are a Joyce Carol Oates fan, then this book is not to be missed.to see.<br />As with virtually all of Oates' books, this one draws the reader into the depths of the mind of the character, and allows one to understand the outrageousness of their behaviour, because the reader is in the mind of the character and feels that character's reactions and emotions.

Roth here, as he did in &quot;Sabbath's Theater,&quot; has raised the level of his pornographic imagery, to literary status.  Yet, the book really has little to do with Sex, and much more to do with Death.  Throughout the book, we are faced with a college professor who has had a long and intricate series of affairs with his students, just after they were no longer his students.  But, the protagonist focuses on one particular student and this student is a collage of past student affairs, which it is the reader's assumption that Roth has indeed experienced personally.<br />So then, what is Roth's complaint?  Not only is his perfect sexual animal a complete and total obsession for him, but in fact, Roth depicts her as potentially, the &quot;last&quot; student affair.  And, if in fact, if it is the last student affair, then it is more on the side of dying, than it is on the side of living.<br />Roth therefore is faced with a terrible dillema.  After 4 decades of obsessive sexuality with every and all types of women, he finds himself allied with the concept that ultimately, when the sex ends; the dying starts.  Roth wages battle within his mind, to overcome this inevitability, but he is nonetheless, stuck with the conclusion, that as his sex life draws to a close, so to, does his mortal life.  As in &quot;Portnoy's Complaint&quot;, Roth once again returns to the image that sex is synonymous with life, and lack of sex is synonymous with death.  But, rather than Portnoy's conclusion, that it is now time to begin, here Roth seems to be saying, it is now time to start to end.  Once one no longer can experience that human ecstasy, then that person's life is drawing to conclusion.  He leaves the question unresolved for himself, as is not unusual for Roth, as to whether he should accept his oncoming death and start to adapt, or whether to remain in denial, until it is no longer deniable.  <br />Once again, Roth gives us a legacy, which, if it has any flaw at all, would be the shortness of the work.  Normally, Roth would give us a fuller understanding of the other characters in the book, but in this case, perhaps, it was only the protagonist's thoughts that really mattered to Roth, and thus, the actual persona of his other characters was superfluous to his message.  This is a highly recommended read, and will allow the reader to absorb a complex message in a slight and incredibly well written 150 pages.	2001-05-21

Let us not be mistaken in that King has no intent on writing literature in his work, despite the surreptitious reference to &quot;A Clean Well Lighted Place&quot; while discussing the &quot;Hemingway Solution&quot; for self-termination.  Nor is King's plot in this book original through the first 550 pages.  And King makes no bones about it, he reveals outright through the dialogue of his characters that the plot is really just a basic science fiction movie, he most often compares it to &quot;The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&quot;  <br />But, it is neither King's intent to write literature, nor to create a unique plot in this case, but rather, to get a message across to millions of people through a masterful use of common language.  His construction is such that his pictures are crystal clear mental images.  And, behind all that imagery, is King's message.<br />That message is interwoven in the intricate explanation of the mental processes that King dissects within the book.  In fact, I felt the book read a lot more like &quot;Insomnia&quot; than like &quot;Desparation&quot; or &quot;The Regulators.&quot;  On a very basic level, King tries to express the idea of emotional telepathy and even some actual verbal and image telepathy.  Except, as a vehicle to increase its reality to the reader, he uses the device of the foreign invader and its infection to increase telepathic levels to way beyond normal human conditions.<br />In brief, most King fans will find the book enjoyable and rewarding.  I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of that genre, either by King or others.	2001-05-01

While I would say I am a fan of Dellilo's work, I would not classify myself as an afficionado.  Of his twelve novels, this is the 5th one I have read.  However, in comparison to the other 4, this one showed a degree of advancement and growth in Dellilo's writing style that heretofore just did not exist.  In &quot;The Body Artist&quot; Dellilo manages in a short 123 pages, to get across the most intense and complex images of life after death of a loved spouse in a most unusual setting.  The book often felt 'Barthelme-like' in its use of phrases and descriptive clauses to create vivid imagery of mental processes.  In a complete reversal from what was almost unbearable verbosity in &quot;Underworld&quot;, in this book, Dellilo delivers thousands of pages of information in just a short book, which could almost be called a Novella, except for the power of the message conveyed by Dellilo.  While I hesitate to give this book a full 5 star rating, I would say that the book is the first one of Dellilo's efforts that is truly on at least the edge of true literature.  I highly recommend it!	2001-04-18
US	52846971	R3F13VG1G7YU9A	0374175403	96429552	In America	Books	1	7	8	N	N	Amazingly Disappointed	I read this book as my first Sontag excursion.  I picked it because it won the National Book Award.  I was incredibly disappointed in the book.  True enough, Sontag is an excellent writer and an expressive one as well.  However, in this book, she seems to have been carried away by a desire to show the reader, just how many different writing styles she seems to perceive herself to have mastered.  She slips into perhaps six different styles of writing in the book, ranging from the epistolary, to the stream of consciousness to the plain prose.  The book is more an experiment in stylized writing techniques and the plot and story are just plain droll.  I found myself wishing I was at the end, by the time I got to the half way point.  While it is unusual for the NBA to give their award to such a mediocre piece of literature, it would be my recommendation to any would be reader that they NOT WASTE THEIR TIME reading THIS BOOK.  It is not worth the investment.  I would have rather reread the plays by Shakespeare and others that she constantly references in her book, just so the reader understands she has a complete knowledge of classic thesbian literature.  I will not bother to read any of her other works, nor any future ones either.	2001-03-10

Being that it was the first book ever to win both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, only done once since, I expected unusually inspiring prose.  I was not disappointed.  Malamud's depiction of a man, in prison, in terrible conditions, virtually concentration camp scenarios, of a man, accused of a crime he did not commit, due to anti-semitism in Russia during the period 1904 through 1907 or thereabouts.  <br />Malamud not only gives us the full impact and feeling of the isolation, desolation and frustration of a prisoner in terrible conditions, waiting just for a &quot;letter of indictment&quot;, not even knowing whether he would be accused of the terrible rumor that abounded.  Malamud takes us through periods of hope for the prisoner, and then dashes those hopes.  He takes us through the feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness and the struggle that such a combination creates with the concept of suicide.<br />Written without any fanciness in terms of high language, but using only words that one could understand with a 9th grade education, Malamud constructs what is a classic novel of our just past century.  It reveals itself with both the absurdity of a Kafka story and the intensity of &quot;Blindness&quot; by Saramago (Nobel Prize for Literature, 1998).  For serious thinkers of the human mind and the places it takes one in conditions of great extremity, this book is a must read item.  To get close to the real feelings of prison hopelessness combined with intense anti-semitism, read Malamud's book and then come to a new understanding of the human condition and its obscurity as an individual in a world turned against one.	2000-09-24

Yet, again it is  another story of a Southerner re-integrating, rather than the rarer  Northerner reintegrating into an emotionally and psychologically war torn  society.<br />While Mr. Bahr's writing is well done, it was overly peppered  with colorful and majestic metaphors.  Often making it feel like he was  &quot;reaching&quot; to make this book more than just a good story, but  actually a 'classic.'  I do not feel he achieved this objective.   Additionally, while his characters and plot were a little 'surrealistic'  there were such incidents immediately following the Civil War, during  Reconstruction.  In a way, like the French will never forgive the Germans  for marching down the Champs E'lysees, so will the 'Deep South' never  forgive the North for the results of the war.  Even in year 2000, the  second century to come since the end of that conflict, the animosity  towards Northerners can still be felt in the South, and in the minds of  true Southerners, the &quot;Conderacy will never DIE!&quot;<br />Because of  the somewhat elaborate and affected style, this book rates only a 4 star  rating.  While very good of its kind, it was not a 'classic.'	2000-09-13
US	52846971	R2403UGKO61U5A	0871137658	553666976	In the Fall	Books	4	6	7	N	Y	Amazed, But Slightly Disappointed	Mr. Lent has captured a literary style that surpasses most novelists in his ability to portray emotionality and non-verbal communication with his extraordinary articulation.  The first 191 pages of the book were perhaps  one of the most emotionally intense texts I have ever read.  Through  metaphoric language which is not overly stylized, Mr. Lent has conveyed the  underlying and heartfelt feelings of his characters in a most illustrative  manner.<br />However, after finishing the first 191 pages, I found, what was  essentially, 200 pages of &quot;filler.&quot;  While the filler was high  quality filler, it was filler nonetheless.  In fact, the style of the  middle 200 pages of the book was so different, that I had the distinct  impression, it was written by another author.  I then found that the  author's style returned at page 395.  I believe that the 200 pages in the  middle were mostly superfluous, and could have been boiled down to 20  pages.  Maybe that is how Lent wrote it to begin with, but his editors  decided that a 325 page book was just not long enough, so they added  another 200 pages.<br />However, Mr. Lent has tackled the Post-Bellum Civil  War era in a Northern setting.  While the majority of the Post-Bellum  historical novels of the &quot;Reconstruction&quot; period, deal with  Southerners re-integrating into a devastated and destroyed homeland, very  few authors have written about the Northern soldiers returning home and  re-integrating into society, which has been ravaged as well by the war, and  by the struggle between ideologies and reality. ... <br />Overall, the book was very good and rated a 4 star rating due to its intensity, subject matter and writing style.  However, because of the 200 pages of 'filler', it does not warrant a full 5 star rating.  However, the last 140 pages of the book return to the author's previous style and teach us, once again, the lesson we all know, that in one way or another, history is destined to repeat itself.	2000-08-28

Coetzee in his latest book, Disgrace, has created a timeless masterpiece of emotion and the process of mental maturation.  Despite the fact that the book takes place in So. Africa, the setting is completely  immaterial to the story.  The basic message and circumstances in the book  could take place in virtually any country in any time.  Additionally,  Coetzee uses especially creative literary technique and in a unique way is  able to keep the reader's attention and yet not reveal his final direction  until the very last line of the very last page.   Coetzee takes the reader  through a process of thought which is revealing and poignant, as well as,  personal and touching.  This book of a mere 220 pages is well worth every  second spent in absorbing the author's message.  It truly deserved the  Booker Award for 1999.	1999-12-12
