The first story involves the capture of Cathy.  Cathy is drugged, tied to a table and raped.  Afterwards, she is photographed unbound.  Patty uses the pictures to convince Cathy to become a slave.   <br /> <br />The second story adds another \\"owner\\" to Cathy's life.  Neighbor Beth catches sight of Patty dominating Cathy through the window and goes to the front door.  Instead of attempting to help Cathy, Beth assures Patty that she wants to join in the fun.  Patty is agreeable to this action, and Cathy doesn't have a say in the matter.  <br /> <br />The third story introduces Cathy's daughter's friend Jen.  Jen visits Cathy at her home and asks to be driven to school, as it appears she missed the bus.  Cathy agrees and starts off with Jen.  They stop off at Jen's house to get something she \\"forgot,\\" but Cathy finds out that Jen hadn't really forgotten anything.  Cathy finds herself bound naked on Jen's bed and attacked.  Eventually, it turns out that Cathy hasn't found another \\"owner\\" but a slave of her own.  <br /> <br />The fourth story involves a special dancer at a strip club.  Patty and Beth want to go on a vacation together and decide to use Cathy to get some money.  Under their power, Cathy finds herself dancing at a strip club, a special dance wherein the customers are allowed to touch, and more. <br /> <br />The fifth story involves Cathy taking out some of her frustration on Jen, and the recruitment of Cathy's daughter, Melissa, to the ranks of slavery.  Cathy helps her slave drug Melissa . . . but Patty and Beth unexpectedly show up. <br /> <br />The sixth story is the continuation, revealed for the first time.  The story is told in a shrink's office, and Cathy relates what happened.  Patty and Beth had some fun with the girls and Cathy's husband Donaldsuddenly appeared and found the action.  He did not enjoy what he saw. <br /> <br />The artwork is good, and it's nice to see an adult graphic novel with strong plot, characterization, and it doesn't hurt that the women are quite attractive. The series of stories is very enjoyable.  More tales have been told, but they have not yet been collected in one book yet.	2005-05-13

The main character is the female member of a couple (Jessica and Brian) that have just recently moved from \\"the city\\" to the suburbs. Specifically to Hillingbury.  The couple: Jessica is the main character and Brian is more or less non-existent (he only matters because of the constraints his existence puts on Jessica's \\"fun\\" - she can not be marked up too badly nor arrive home too late).  The secondary point of view comes from an agent of the Private House named Matt.  Matt is in Hillingsbury to investigate the activities of the residents after a police report is directed to \\"The Supreme Mistress\\" of the Private House (the Private House is only touched upon in the book, and is therefore something of an unknown entity to me).  The police report notes that some \\"depraved\\" activity occurs in Hillingsbury, but that no action has been taken by the police.  Matt is undercover as a worker at the Hillingbury Health and Exercise Club, and his section of the book, or his P.O.V., mostly occurs as field reports sent to \\"Mistress Julia\\" (though both Matt and Jessica interact in the book). <br /> <br />The men of Hillingbury, for the most part, work in \\"the city,\\" while the women appear to be mostly housewives.  An organization called the HYWAPOC controls the social society (the wives) of the village, and Jessica first learns of it when she leaves her new house and investigates the village (she sees a notice for a meeting posted in a shop).  Well, to shorten an otherwise long description, a somewhat simplification: the HYWAPOC is an organization of women that all women of the village must belong to or be cut off from the social scene.  Everything is run by this committee (including home improvements and the like), and to get on to the committee (which is wrongly assumed, by the committee members, to be the goal ofall women) the women must first spend some time as \\"pets\\" of committee members.  The pets move up to become committee members after they convince the female member of new home owners (apparently there is always people moving to Hillingbury) to become a pet, or to be \\"owned\\" as a \\"pet\\" by another woman.  Jessica ends up joining this organization as a pet. <br /> <br />Jessica first hears of the HYWAPOC when she visits that previously mentioned shop (and meets Mrs. Morgan), but she first learns of the hidden component of her inner workings through her interactions with Matt at the health club.  At the health club, Matt works as Jessica's trainer and pushes her boundaries and dominates her.  Outside the health club, she isn't dominated by anyone until she is visited by a female neighbor by the name of Mel.  Eventually one thing leads to another, and Jessica becomes the \\"pet\\" of Mel.  The book chronicles Jessica's transformation from a \\"normal\\" woman into a submissive woman, constantly desiring domination.   <br /> <br />Hopefully, without giving too much away, the Private House and the organization in Hillingbury is similar in many ways but significantly different in that the organization in Hillingbury forces newcomers to be submissive pets and then forces these pets to move over to the owner side of the relationship after a certain amount of time.  The Private House allows the individual to choice which part of the relationship, dominate or submissive, that they want to inhabit. <br /> <br />The characters can be quite believable, though at times appear to be mere shallow almost nonexistent names on the page (like Jessica's husband Brian), and while the most developed personality is Jessica, most of the other characters have some layers to them.  Not all are as well-developed as they might have been able to become, but developed enough for the purposes of the book.   There are obvious distinguishable differences between the characters, and it is not hard to determinewhich character is which.  The writing is quite will done.  The setting is somewhat undefined, though some suburb in the UK would seem to be the setting (and it is quite possible that \\"the city\\" is London, and maybe that fact might have been slipped between the covers of the book somewhere).  Depending on the readers own experiences and desires for the book, the book's action and activity can be quite enjoyable to read.  Oddly enough, I rather enjoyed this book, and gave it high marks (not a solid 5 out of 5 stars, but very close to that absolute upper limit). <br /> <br />The dedication of the book is to \\"Rebecca\\" the illustrator of the  \\"Housewives at Play\\" comic book (which is actually a series), and notes that the subject matter of \\"Housewives at Play\\" is \\"what Pet Training . . . is all about.\\"  Again, I don't want to give too much away, but, besides the obvious fact that one series is in the form of illustrations - a graphic novel, and the other is in the form of words on paper, the two series are, in fact, quite similar, though the actual comic book series of \\"Housewives at Play\\" (as opposed to just the \\"pin-up\\" books) involves more forced domination than occurs in the book \\"Pet Training.\\"  \\"Pet Training,\\" on the other hand, involves an individual that is eager to be dominated (though there is a least one relatively brief subplot that follows the eager to be dominated type of interaction in \\"Housewives at Play\\").  It is important to point out that the only man involved in the \\"action\\" is Matt, the rest the \\"fun\\" is performed by females.	2005-05-10

Muller's first book in the series, The Distance, has won the Shamus Award, the Mystery Ink Gumshoe Award for Best first Novel and was nominated for the Anthony, Macavity, and Barry awards.  A non-fiction work that Muller apparently worked on between the Nichols books was nominated for the Edgar and Macavity awards (The Art of Noir).  Unfortunately, his second Billy Nichols book is seemingly lacking in nominations or awards (and none of his other books has so far been nominated for anything). <br /> <br />The first book was deeply involved in Nichols working as \\"Mr. Boxing,\\" the premier boxing journalist in California.  The second book, on the other hand, while including some boxing activity, has Nichols submerge himself into the world of financial/business journalism.  The man who Nichols helped put in jail was apparently involved in a financial fraud/scam in California, involving some high ranking people (or at least highly regarded people).  Nichols, though reluctant to help Burney Sanders, decides to examine the situation and acquires help along the way from one of the best financial journalist of the era (though he is now working outside journalism).  Along the way Nichols ends up trying to help Sanders former secretary, who apparently had fled the scene when the trouble started in the first book. <br /> <br />A very detailed, imaginative historical noir book that is not as good as the first book in the series (the first book was given 4.60 stars out of 5; the second barely makes it over 4 stars).	2005-04-29

A nice collection, though a little to \\"just there\\" not doing anything. <br /> <br />Even though Irvin Bomb's book (Art of Irvin Bomb) is quite similar, there is just something about Bomb's artwork that raises it to the above 4 star level while Mobius' work, while good, falls below that rating.

The story begins with extremely muscular Jack getting dressed to go to meet Roderick Ottermer.  On the bed in the room is a nude woman, and as he is leaving, she asks Jack if they have a future together, and just like that, they're through. <br /> <br />Ottermer lives in a castle like palace guarded by some huge nude demon statutes.  When Jack walks in he spots three people in the room.  Ottermer, and two nude people one male one female.  The nude people leave the room, and later the girl returns in a revealing transparent dress (top is transparent).  Jack's hired and told to start looking for the missing \\"wife,\\" Joyce, where she hangs out, in strip clubs. <br /> <br />Jack hurriedly strolls through several strip clubs until he finds one where a woman, a very skeletal woman, is being beaten for refusing to go out and dance.  Jack intervenes, takes out the woman (\\"ugliest . . . dog I've ever seen\\") beating skeleton girl and is attacked by all the other nude women at the club, who think that he is the \\"Gamesman.\\"  There are definitely some ugly woman in this here book (and some pretty ones to).   <br /> <br />When the fight's stopped on account that they find out he isn't the Gamesman, Joyce shows up with a gun.  Jack ignores the woman with the gun, and takes skeletal girl away from the strip club and gives her some money.  He returns and learns that Joyce's \\"husband\\" is the Gamesman and that he likes to mutilate her and force tattoos onto her.  The Gamesman would track Joyce down in the city, grab her in broad daylight, throw her into his car and then head back to his home.  Once there he would inject Joyce with drugs, and the games would be on.  There's another 22 pages left, and I don't want to give everything away. <br /> <br />Overall, the book is well-drawn, not pretty, but well-drawn just the same.  The story is an interesting one, though a little thin.  The book contains rape/nc/humiliation/she-males/etc.  Quite a violent little book, definitely not for the weak of heart.	2005-04-13

Right, sorry.  This book is about a young woman named Jill.  Jill narrates the story through the method of an \\"audio\\" diary.     <br /> <br />Jill just moved out of her parent's home a couple of months ago and needs some money to pay her bills but is having trouble keeping jobs.  Man that girl is hot.   <br /> <br />The story starts with Jill waking up with three men after getting drunk with them at a bar.  She tries to disengage, succeeds and leaves to try to arrive at her job on time but she is already late.  She slips into some skin tight clothes without adding underwear to her ensemble and heads off to her clothing store job (oh, and her tights are semi-transparent). <br /> <br />In her get-up, Jill makes a lot of sales at the store, but knows that she is going to get fired.  While Jill is in the break room, the store owner's son enters and oops, out pops his huge johnson.  While they are having some fun the manager looks in, is shocked, and leaves.  After the \\"fun\\" is over, the kid gives Jill some money (oh, and that \\"fun\\" has made certain sections on the waist of Jill's tights completely transparent). Despite selling a lot of merchandise, Jill is told that she will be let go at the end of the week. <br /> <br />While attempting to set some sales records Jill is approached by some men that want to know how to \\"get\\" with her.  She tells them to pay her.  They don't want to do that and leave.  Two other men overhear and wander up and ask how much and then offer $1000. <br /> <br />Jill isn't certain if she really wants to \\"rent\\" herself and has to think about it.  She thinks about it after work when she goes to the bar with a female friend.  She decides to do it. She goes to the address the men gave her and the men show up, and lead her into a dark alley to a dirty mattress.  They end up being rather huge, give Jill a lot of pleasure, and then give her $2000. Jill's new career begins (or continues after being paid by the store owner's son). The story continues for another 38 or so pages.  Jill: \\"I actually look forward to going to \\"work\\".\\" <br /> <br />Overall, the book is very well-drawn, the plot isn't anything much, and the book is quite good. And Jill is one hot woman, and she certainly knows how to dress.	2005-04-13

There are exactly 37 well-drawn detailed drawings of women inside the book.  Obviously enough, all the pictures have some connection to weddings, just married women, or just about to be married women.  The pictures range from somewhat tame (I guess the tamest one in this collection would involve a woman kissing the bride) to somewhat extreme (involving bondage in one form or another, humiliation, getting caught in action, whipping).  The women are brides, guests, in-laws, bridesmaids, and the maid of honor.  The men, if there is a man in the picture, is shown shocked/surprised at the action, is being \\"thanked\\" by the bride, is walking away happy, is a priest, or is being distracted.    Most of the action occurs outdoors or in some form of church or hotel (like the picture of the surprise guest on the honey-moon), but some of the action does occur in-doors (like the picture where the in-laws welcoming their new daughter-in-law by whipping her).  <br /> <br />Overall, the collection is interesting, and well-drawn.  The collection contains pictures of bondage, whipping, and humiliation.  Note: some of the collections contain a page that collects the title of the pictures, and this is one of those collections.  The page is at the very back of the book and is called the \\"Table of Contents.\\"	2005-04-11

An interesting little shallow book	Full-color Adult graphic novel.  Based on Italian porn star Selen. <br /> <br />This relatively short full-color graphic novel involves Selen, her husband (Fabio) and their rather open relationship and some scenes from their life.   <br /> <br />Scene 1: The book opens with the husband on the phone with another woman (Francesca), letting her know that he won't go out with her unless she doesn't \\"wear any underwear and shave.\\"  The husband leaves after asking if Selen wants to go with him, and her refusal, and picks up a young woman.  The young woman is wearing a short skirt, and when sits in the car, it is obvious that she followed Fabio's orders.  Fabio and Francesca play around in the car, and outside the car in the driving rain. <br /> <br />When Fabio arrives back home, Selen, wearing next to nothing, tries to start something up with Fabio, but he is starting to feel ill, and turns in. <br /> <br />Scene 2 (immediately following scene 1):  It's the next morning, Fabio is ill, and Francesca stops by the front door.  Selen answers the door wearing a transparent top and nothing else. Francesca is wearing a short shirt and a jacket and no underwear (panties/bra). <br /> <br />Francesca tries to tempt Fabio, but he is too ill.  \\"Half an hour later.\\" Selen and Francesca are in bed on either side of the ill Fabio, both women are nude (well almost, apparently Selen had been wearing something other than a transparent top after all).  While the man is otherwise preoccupied with being ill, the relatively large breasted blonde and rather flat-chested brunette decide to play with each other.  At some point, Selen ends up begging Francesca to whip her (which she obliges; I really can't stress enough how flat-chested Francesca is).  This scene continues, with a voyeur adding his perspective to the fun. <br /> <br />Scene 3: \\"Six months Later\\"  Selen and Fabio have just moved, and its Selen's birthday.  They hold a party with many guests, including Francesca, and Selen has to perform several tasks to receive her gifts (including running naked through the street to ring a neighbor's doorbell. <br /> <br />Scene 4: The \\"real-world\\" intrudes, and the real Selen and the artist talk. <br /> <br />The book is well-drawn, nothing is censored, and there is little plot.  The book contains exhibitism, whipping, voyeurism, open marriages . . .  An interesting little shallow book.	2005-04-11

This graphic novel was originally published as three separate comic magazines.  The first chapter takes place in London.      The first chapter opens with Lilian and Agatha sharing a bath together and Mr. Holmes and Dr. Freud in the next room.  While Mr. Holmes and Dr. Freud wait in the next room, the girls activity heat up.  When the girls emerge, they note that they have been having the same nightmares, so they head off to visit a friend of Dr. Freud that knows something about hypnosis and repressed memories.  We meet this friend (Dr. Fester) of Dr. Freud abusing one of his patients while she is under hypnosis.      While the girls and Dr. Freud are distracted, Holmes wanders off to investigate the case of a missing woman.  And oddly enough, after exiting a morgue, Holmes runs across the woman in the process of being abducted.      Back at Dr. Festers, the girls enter a state of hypnosis and recall their nightmares, which involves something called \\"The Institute.\\"  Apparently this Institute has something to do with Ishtar and a lot of naked women.  Oh, and Ishtar is a she-male.  While Ishtar and the women start to attack Lilian and Agatha, the good doctors try to bring the girls out of hypnosis.  Agatha awakens, but they can't revive Lilian.  While this state of affairs is occurring, Mr. Holmes enters the room leading the woman that he had been seeking.  Holmes wants only Freud to work on the girl because of Dr. Festers history (which is now shown in fuzzy pink light - apparently one of Fester's patients became very attached to Fester and then died).      Agatha and Holmes return home, leaving Lilian behind.  Lilian \\"wakes\\" up to find herself in a strange room. Apparently the world Lilian inhabits is really like that Matrix movie.  Lilian wakes up with a lot of things connecting to her in some watery stuff.  She disconnects herself and gets out of the pod.  A robot comes by and end of the first chapter.    Chapter Two: Lilian isstill stuck \\"awake\\" in this Matrix like world, which appears to be controlled by the she-male Ishtar.  Meanwhile, while Watson is laid up in bed ill, his niece Rhona comes by to provide him some care.  In his ill state, Watson imagines Holmes and his niece fondling each other right in front of him.  Dorian Grey joins the fun as an owner of an entertainment facility that uses slaves to provide entertainment for his guests.  Grey's men turn up at Watson's and attack Agatha and Rhona, strip them, and end up beaten by the girls.  Meanwhile Lilian's story in the \\"real world\\" continues with the she-male.  Apparently, the computer feeds off sexual energy.  And now Agatha and Rhona are captured, and some strange magic overcomes them and they \\"sleep\\" with each other.  And the chapter ends.    Chapter three: While ill, Watson \\"accidentally\\" attacks and rapes his nurse.  The police arrive and arrest the nurse, as one of Dr. Moriarty's spies.  The girls at Grey's place continue their strange horniness and Lilian tries to escape from the computer.  More bondage and sex fill out the rest of the chapter (don't want to give everything away).    Overall, the drawing is good, but at times the earlier black & white nature of the drawing leaks through, and destroys some of the artwork (though it is less of a problem than in the previous book).  This book is weaker than the two first volumes and about on a same level of quality with the third volume.  The book contains bondage, whipping, she-males, and more.  There is a fifth volume in the series, but it currently is still in magazine form (and is not that good; Agatha and Lilian are old now and the story involves their grandkids).	2005-04-11

This is the first collection of drawings involving housewives.  There are roughly 58 well-drawn detailed drawings of women inside the book.  The pictures range from the tamer to pictures that are more in the extreme range (involving bondage in one form or another, humiliation, getting caught in action, whipping).  The women are mothers and daughters, neighbors, students, teachers, lactating women, pregnant women, neighbors, and friends.  The men are either shocked at the action or unaware of the action, or being distracted.    The action occurs in-doors (like the picture where four women are \\"cooking\\" in the kitchen while their husbands watch a football game), outside (numerous, like the picture where the real estate agent has bound the housewife outdoors with the wife's legs spread wide, next to a sign that reads \\"Open Wife\\"), at a doctor's office (like the picture of the very through examination),  in a fast-food restroom (two women, at least one an employee (other is completely naked so hard to tell), caught having fun), at a store (like the picture where a woman wanders in to a store that says \\"No Shirt no Shoes no service\\" wearing just shoes and shirt, and with the shirt pulled way up), and at school (like the one where a school is used for a childbirth class; or the one where Chrissy's mom and Jennifer's mom visit the class, with one fully clothed, and the other on the ground (the sex slave)).      Overall, the collection is interesting, and well-drawn.  The collection contains pictures of incest, bondage, whipping, exhibitism (forced), cooking of the female, and humiliation.  Note: some of the collections contain a page that collects the title of the pictures, but this one does not.	2005-04-11

Books	4	21	21	N	N	Interesting book, not the best	Adult full-color graphic novel. <br /> <br />Connie is a woman that really wants to be a super-model but is unfortunately blessed with un-super-model features (large breasts and a healthy size rear-end; though she is thin otherwise).   <br /> <br />The book opens with a scene with Connie at a model agency.  A man (Katz) grabs one of her breasts and asks \\"What is this?\\"  It's fat, the man notes, Connie is fat.  The man wants Connie to stop eating, as he uses models that fill clothes, not rip them open.  Connie really wants to be a model, though, and agrees to go back to the man's place as maybe Katz \\"can find something for\\" Connie.  That something?  Polishing his shoes, oh, and a photo shoot with a small company.  Connie is very happy and is very grateful, providing the man with pleasure, until she storms out when the man calls her fat and frigid (oh, and apparently this \\"relationship\\" has been going on for two years). <br /> <br />Connie decides that enough is enough and goes to a doctor (Dr. Vesalio, Nutritionist, according to the name plate).  He examines her thoroughly (very thoroughly) and finds that she has a healthy body.  Connie doesn't believe him and the doctor gives her some miracle pills after she \\"pays\\" whatever the doctor asks.   <br /> <br />Connie returns home, and takes some of the pills and goes to sleep.  The \\"miracle\\" pills cause Connie to have some very strange dreams of bondage, a fat woman dressed like a rodent (fat Connie in the future), and causes Connie to have her first orgasm (apparently), and leads to many more (her libido is freed).   <br /> <br />The next day, Connie goes off to her lingerie photo shoot (the shoot is conducted by two twins, one female, and one male).  At the shoot, Connie begins to feel hungry, so she takes some pills and becomes horny.  She has some fun with the twins and ends up with another job for one of the twins' friends.  And the book continues on this path for another twenty-three pages. <br /> <br />The book isinteresting, the characters are quite strange and the plot flows along thinly.  The book contains bondage, whipping, lesbianism, rape, and fantasy sequences.	2005-04-11

There are exactly 36 well-drawn detailed drawings of women inside the book.  Obviously enough, all the pictures have some connection to mothers and daughters.  The pictures range from somewhat tame (I guess the tamest ones involve the mother and daughter being happy about the action) to somewhat extreme (involving bondage in one form or another, humiliation, getting caught in action, whipping).  Not all of the women included in the pictures are mothers and daughters, but most are.  I could be overlooking someone, but I believe that there are no men in this collection.  The action occurs in-doors and outside (like the picture where the mother has chained her daughter outside in the cold for all to partake of the whipped spoiled girl). <br /> <br />Overall, the collection is interesting, and well-drawn.  The collection contains pictures of incest, bondage, whipping, and humiliation.  Note: some of the collections contain a page that collects the title of the pictures, and this is one of those collections.  The page is at the very back of the book and is called the \\"Table of Contents.\\"  Obviously enough, this isn't a collection for just anyone, and probably not the book to be used to enter the Rebecca world.	2005-04-11

The copyright page black & white drawing of two women shows what this book could have been like if the artist had drawn the rest of the pictures with that level of detail (quite good drawing) instead of the hasty \\"sketch\\" book approach Wolf took with the rest of the pictures (if you get the chance to see the back cover, then what I'm describing might be better illustrated, as the back cover involves two full-colored women leaning against a sketchy black and white drawing).  The pictures are interesting, and some are drawn with slightly more detail and time, but most are quite sketchy, and interesting despite that approach being taken, but the hasty sketchy approach is annoying (in some of the pictures, the other characters are just outlines).  Some of the pictures are linked, and tell a brief story, though there is not one coherent thread throughout the book (other than superheroes in bondage, or superhero villains tormenting the innocent). <br /> <br />Book contains single pictures and linked pictures (that tell almost silent stories), some of which are quite violent (at least in the sense that they imply that the character is in the process of dying or being cooked).  Despite the mention of the hasty/sketchy appearance of many of the pictures, the book is interesting.	2005-04-11

There are roughly 56 well-drawn detailed drawings of women inside the book.  The pictures range from the tamer to pictures that are more in the extreme range (involving bondage in one form or another, humiliation, getting caught in action, whipping).  The women are mothers and daughters, neighbors, students, teachers, lactating women, pregnant women, neighbors, brides, rival soccer moms, and friends.  The men are either shocked at the action or looking for their women. <br /> <br />The action occurs in-doors (like the woman caught having fun on the washing machine), outside (numerous, like the picture of one of the soccer moms of the losing team bound over a grill being whipped), at a doctor's office (like the picture of the aggressive OB GYN), at a hospital, and at school (like the picture of the back to school parents night).   <br /> <br />Overall, the collection is interesting, and well-drawn.  The collection contains pictures of incest, bondage, whipping, exhibitism (forced), cooking, and humiliation.

Full-color graphic novel	Adult full-color graphic novel. <br /> <br />This graphic novel was originally published as three separate comic magazines.  The first chapter takes place in Egypt, out in the Sahara Desert in \\"the mirage city,\\" in England and in Vienna and follows three stories-lines.   The second and third chapters mostly take place in the mirage city. <br /> <br />The first chapter opens with a ritual in Egypt, specifically in the pyramid of Cheops.  A naked blond virgin is lead into the chamber.  An Egyptian woman, with a forked tongue, examines the woman, and then shoves a long green snake into the blond woman's anus.  Out comes some strange glow from the blond woman, a mummy awakens, orgy time.  Later the action moves to the Sahara desert, to a mirage city.  More orgy, and then it appears that the Egyptians plan on raising another mummy, Set, and they use magic to determine which woman's body Set will inhabit.  The woman that they need to find?  Lilian (from the two previous books). <br /> <br />The action switches over to Vienna where Lilian is in a session with Sigmund Freud (\\"No, Doctor Freud . . . .  I have no sexual fantasies, only memories\\").  And just as we were entering this session, the scene shifts again. <br /> <br />The scene shifts to England, specifically 221 Baker Street London.  Agatha is staying with a Mr. Holmes, who appears to be addicted to opium.  Agatha is trying to get him to stop by distracting him with her body. <br /> <br />And now back to Vienna.  While Lilian is under the effects of a tranquilizer, Freud examines Lilian's sexual organs.  Annoyed, Lilian flees into the night and is captured by some strange winged men and carried to Egypt, and end chapter one. <br /> <br />Chapter two: Lilian is carried to Egypt, and Agatha dreams that Lilian is in trouble, and so Agatha and Holmes head to Egypt.  Orgies abound, and at one point, while wandering around a palace, Lilian uses her magic to turn a eunuch back into a fully-functioning man.  More orgy, andLilian becomes Set.  End chapter two (don't want to be too detailed). <br /> <br />Chapter three: Lilian is now Set and Agatha tries to help set Lilian free from the possession. Agatha runs into a fellow witch who helps her.  Agatha is placed in bondage gear and sold to the palace so that she might try to find Lilian and help her.  The Prince is very picky about whom he will allow as entertainment, and many end up with the heads cut off, and this is the man Agatha is brought before.  I'll end here to keep from giving too much away. <br /> <br />Overall, the drawing is good, but at times the earlier black & white nature of the drawing leaks through, and destroys some of the artwork.  This book is weaker than the two previous volumes.  The book contains death, bondage, whipping, and more.	2005-04-11

The pictures range from somewhat tame (two happy women together) to somewhat extreme (involving bondage in one form or another, humiliation, getting caught in action or incest, or the cooking of some form of the female body).  The women are mothers and daughters, teachers, neighbors, one nun and students.  The men, if there is a man in the picture, is wearing a dress or other female garment and acting like a servant, or is shown shocked/surprised at the antics of their wife, or is happily walking away from a used woman, or is using someone else's wife.  Some of the action is conducted behind closed doors (like the one where two women are caught together in the bathroom) and some of the action is quite open (like the picture of a daughter (I assume) sitting in the backyard with rope attached to one leg and one stake hammered into the ground). <br /> <br />Overall, the collection is interesting, and well-drawn.

This book is a full-length comic as opposed to the others in the housewives graphic book series, which are collections of pictures.  This book falls between the fifth and sixth comic magazines.  The housewife comic series is published in a small thin adult comic magazine-form, and follows the story of Cathy, a housewife, that becomes a slave to two female neighbors, acquires a slave of her own (one of her daughters female friends) and introduces her daughter to the life-style.  This particular book-length comic tells the story of Cathy in an insane asylum telling her story of her life as a lesbian slave to a female doctor. <br /> <br />An interesting well-drawn comic.

Based on Italian porn star Selen. <br /> <br />This relatively short full-color graphic novel is the third book in the series that involves Selen, her husband Fabio and their rather open relationship and some scenes from their life.   <br /> <br />Fabio and Selen visit a friend in the city of Perugia and several scenes occur in that city. <br /> <br />Scene 1: Fabio and Selen visit with Carlo and his \\"Japanese\\" girlfriend (Tiziana) in Perugia (she doesn't exactly look Japanese).  At dinner, Carlo mentions that Selen is becoming less daring, and Fabio agrees.  Annoyed, Selen knocks something off the table, and when the waiter comes by to pick it up, he gets an eye-full up Selen's skirt.  Later, in the car after dinner, Selen and Tiziana strip in the backseat, enjoy each other, and then start in on Fabio, who happens to be driving.   <br /> <br />Scene 2: Fabio and Selen visit a theme park.  Selen dresses like a \\"little virgin\\" in a rather ugly green dress that is quite small, short hem-line and very plunging neck-line (I'm not sure her breasts are actually covered in that thing, and this is her \\"virgin\\" dress).  Before they head off to the park, Selen, Fabio and Carlo fondle each other.   <br /> <br />At the park, Selen has fun showing herself off (riding on the swing ride without panties, and with the seat arranged so that all is revealed to all below).   <br /> <br />Scene 3: Ride home from the park.  On the way home from the park, Selen, Carlo and Fabio stop off on the side of the road and have some fun. <br /> <br />The book is well-drawn, nothing is censored, and there is little plot.  The book contains exhibitism, open marriages . . .  An interesting little shallow book that is just a tad too short to be good.	2005-04-11

The women are mothers and daughters, teachers, doctors, students, lactating women, pregnant women, and neighbors.  The men, if there is a man in the picture, is shown shocked/surprised at the antics of their wife, or is not yet aware of the nature of the action.  Some of the action is conducted behind closed doors (like the one where two women are caught together in the bedroom) and some of the action is quite open (like the back to back pictures of a daughter (I assume) sitting in the outdoors, naked, under a sign that notes \\"My Daughter \\"Puts Out!\\" and a mother, mostly naked (or at least exposed) under a sign that states \\"uck my mom's hot . . .\\"). <br /> <br />Overall, the collection is interesting, and well-drawn.

Just like the first one, this collection is filled with women in various stages of bondage and undress (some, like the girl on the cover, is fully dressed (though with her skirt back and panties a little out of alignment)) and some are mostly to completely naked like the girl on the back cover (the only two pictures that are in color).  And like the first collection, some of the pictures come with little statements from Alazar, like \\"Much to her dismay, Barbara's cell phone had no roaming features!\\"  Unlike the first collection, this time Alazar hasn't hidden any of the women behind heavy obscuring shading. <br /> <br />This second collection of drawing is better than the first, if for no other reason than the quality remains around the same (highish) but this time there is not heavy shading on some of the pictures.  As mentioned, two of the pictures are in color, the back and front of the book, and the rest are in black & white.  The women are attractive and, as mentioned, in various stages of undress and bondage.  For the most part, the women are either clearly angry or in some level of distress and the only happy ones (two) aren't in bondage and are dominating bound women.  A good collection of drawings and, obviously enough, not for anyone that dislikes bondage or books that lack plot.	2005-04-11

The women are mothers and daughters, neighbors, students, teachers, lactating women, pregnant women, and friends.  There are two visible men in the pictures. One doesn't count because he is on the front cover (and I haven't been counting the book cover pictures) and the other is just barely in the picture and could conceivably be a woman.  The action occurs in-doors (like the picture where the mostly nude woman catches, I assume, her daughter stealing some cookies) and outside (numerous, like the daughter that drives her nude mother around, or the girl who receives a ride from another girl (\\"thanks for the ride, queer\\")). <br /> <br />Overall, the collection is interesting, and well-drawn.

Books	4	6	6	N	N	One of the better Milo books	Adult full-color adult graphic novel. <br /> <br />This story involves two female roommates who pick up some extra cash by allowing themselves to be filmed for an internet website, and a sister that stops by.   <br /> <br />The book opens with the girl's sponsor calling and complaining about the lack of website visitors and threatening to replace the two girls.  The blonde, Wendy, who answered the phone, begs for another chance and the sponsor tells her to smile and pump up the sexual energy.  Wendy immediately lifts up her shirt and yells to Wilma, her roommate, to tell her the news. <br /> <br />Wendy really gets into the action, but Wilma is more reluctant.  Wendy masturbates while Wilma reads a book with her waist barely exposed.  When Wendy notices that Wilma is missing, she goes looking for her.  They start playing with each other out of camera range, and before anything more can develop, the doorbell rings (out of computer camera range, not graphic novel reader eyeball range). <br /> <br />Wanda, Wendy's sister, turns up.  Wanda mentions that she has fled her boyfriend and mentions how they meet and how he dominated her.  Wanda meet her boyfriend on the street.  She was attempting to get something out of the pockets in her tight jeans when he came up and said that he would help if she would unbutton her pants.  He then got her to unbutton her shirt, and made her walk down the street with her crotch and breasts exposed.  Oddly enough, she let him do this to her, and she liked it.  They ended up dating, with him finding new ways to dominate her. He would handcuff her to the bed, burn off some of her pubic hair, shave off the rest, force her to dance without panties in a nightclub, and make sure that he flings her around for all to see. He would also force her to wander around panty-less, bending over for objects, and eventually, the final straw, putting her nude in a stockade at a party.  The guests would play with her and keep dumping liquor down her throat.Wanda left the boyfriend after that last incident and immediately went to her sister's place. <br /> <br />The new girl joins in the fun, when she finds out about the camera.  All three play with each other in front of the camera.  The ex-boyfriend had been watching, and when a shot of the outside was shown, he figured out where they were.  That night he broke in and . . . the story continues for another 17 pages. <br /> <br />The book has good artwork, a stronger story than some of his books, and overall, a good book. The book contains: exhibitism, voyeurism, bondage, domination and submission and, I believe, death.	2005-04-04

The first story is titled \\"Sense of Modesty.\\"  Apparently, a group wants to test to see if \\"modesty is a natural human attribute or if it's just imposed by law and religion.\\"  To test this theory, the come up with the brilliant plan to have a geeky man walk up to strange women in the street and ask to see them shirt-less and bra-less or skirt-less and panty-less for a reward of money (strange thing about that geeky guys hair; one minute it is orangish, then purplish, and then orangish again).    The second story is titled \\"Three-Breasted Woman from Mars.\\"  A group wants to stage a fake Mars invasion.  They use a fake space ship and a nude woman painted green and with a fake third breast.  All goes wrong, cars crash, people injured, and mobs rioting.  Green woman left behind, has to dangle along beneath the fake spaceship. ..    The third story is titled \\"Crime and Punishment.\\"  This story involves a man with a camera that has pretended to film a red-head at a train station until he realizes that he might have gotten her in trouble with the man she was with.  He follows after her until she arrives at a house.  He points his camera through a window and films the woman being punished by her husband and mother-in-law.      The fourth story is titled \\"the Set-Up.\\"  A rich man wants to have an X-rated video-tape made of him in bed with his wife.  He has some film of her already, and so the group he visits suggests using a substitute.  A woman is called in to play the part, but through a series of mistakes, a different woman, one of the film crew, ends up on the bed.      The fifth story is titled \\"Ballerina.\\"  This story involves the Miss Italy beauty pageant and a rather flat-chested young woman that wants the chance to perform her talent on camera.  The talent: ballerina.  The girl was promised her chance, the comedian ran long, and well, it doesn't end pretty.  (And why \\"death\\" is included in the list at the end).    The sixth and last story is titled \\"The Ritual.\\"  While on board a plane, one of the men of the film crew over-hears an interesting conversation between a woman and a rather pale skeletal man.  Apparently the woman will have to be examined due to the believe that she is a witch.  The film crew man decides to film the two people involved in the conversation.  The film crew man phones his crew and tells them the plan.  As the woman and man are checking into a hotel, a man in a costume comes up and says \\"do you recognize me\\" (the costume involves the head of a goat or something like that and a long robe).  The woman freaks out and the skeletal man states that the examination will have to be more extensive.  The skeletal man and the woman walk along a canal, and the priest begins the examination right there.  He tells her to strip, walk along ahead of him, and then to immerse herself into the very cold canal water.      Overall, the book has good artwork, and silly little scenes. This book includes: exhibitism, whipping, death, and rituals.	2005-04-04

The book opens with a scene of Girl buying some merchandise from \\"Cloven Hoof.\\"  Immediately after the visit to that special shop, Girl stops off at the Kat Kat club for some nude dancing.  Afterward, Girl is fondled by one of her fellow strippers and her boss. A large amount of sexual activity occurs before Girl is able to eventually make the deal with the devil.  In between (the buying of the merchandise and performing the ritual to make a deal), Girl wanders around in very skimpy revealing clothing, has men ejaculate onto her as she is attempting to leave a fast food restaurant, has an orgy in the back of a convertible along a city street, and in an alley,  dances some more at the strip club, is fondled some more and finally, the ritual.   <br /> <br />The sexy young woman asks for immortality in her current form.  In return the devil/demon has some sexual fun with Girl.  Girl will get what she wants, as long as she receives his \\"rapture\\" or finds a replacement.  Girl must find a replacement (or offer herself up) every thirteen years, plus the first one, on the very next day.  While playing with herself, the \\"camera\\" pulls back to reveal a man with a camera, who had been watching her.  End chapter one. <br /> <br />The book includes four chapters.  The second chapter sees Girl waking up next to that female stripper who had been fondling her earlier, a man burst into flames when he touched Girl without her consent (those with consent, apparently, do not burst into flames, that or they are demons), an orgy in the back of a car (yep, they were demons),  some more dancing at the strip club,  an introduction to an adult film producer who will lead her into that world, and the sacrifice of another.  Chapter three (\\"The Pawn\\") sees some more orgies (for which Girl is paid for her services), some more strip dancing, wandering the streetsin revealing clothing, and dreaming about filming an adult film.  The fourth chapter is the last and so I'll just mention that some more of the same occur, plus . . . <br />   <br />Overall, the artwork is good, only slightly hindered by being black & white and the plot is, well, strange.  The book includes exhibitism, voyeurism, devils/demons, orgies, lesbianism, etc.	2005-04-04

Luckily for him, Galipettois a first-class carpenter that makes his living carving toys.  Using a tree that collapsed into his shack, Galipetto creates a wooden woman.  After he is finished, he takes the little wooden woman for a test drive, and unknown to him, this causes the woman to come alive.  Galipetto learns about this amazing transformation when Pinocchia, nude but for shoes and an apron, brings Galipetto breakfast and asks if he is her papa. <br /> <br />Some local police stop by and ask if anything is damaged after the storm, to find a nearly nude woman rushing from the back room, and hugging her \\"papa.\\"  The police take them to jail. <br /> <br />While in jail, Pinocchia, nude but for a mutating coat (one minute a green coat, the next a green dress), ends up going down on one of the men there in jail.  As the police do not have anything on Pinocchia, they release her, but keep Galipetto in jail.  So, the barely clothed woman wanders down the street and is picked up by a man in a car. <br /> <br />The man takes her to a party, where a woman helps Pinocchia change clothes (and who ends up fondling Pinocchia).  While the women are otherwise occupied, two men peer into the room, and eventually lead Pinocchia away from the party and, at the first opportunity, prostitute her.  The rascals run off with Pinocchia's pay, and without leaving her any money to pay the hotel bill.  While Pinocchia begins to \\"pay\\" for the room with her mouth, the hotel owner's wife runs in and spanks Pinocchia with a wooden object.  Pinocchia flees the hotel.   <br /> <br />In the meantime, Galipetto is released and he wanders along in his night clothes, attempting to return home.  Along the way he ends up at the same house Pinocchia wandered up to and entered after she fled the angry wife.  While his creation is screwing around with a man up on the second floor, Galipetto is offered the position of gardener.  The gardener was just fired and thrown off the premises for sleeping with the maid. <br /> <br />Running away from an attempted forced and unwanted bath, Galipetto runs across his Pinocchia, who has reverted to wooden status.  Galipetto \\"revives\\" her, is caught  . . . and the tail continues its twists and turns for another 25 pages (and in those 25 pages? visit to a circus, underwater brothel on a submarine . . .).   <br /> <br />In the Pinocchio story, there was a certain punishment rendered upon him when he lied (his nose grew).  Well, in this case, when Pinocchia lies, her breasts grow (and she doesn't lie, apparently, until after page 35; though, at one point she purposely lies to save herself in the water, and ends up with massive breasts).   <br /> <br />Overall, a very good little graphic novel, with great artwork and a good pace. The book includes a small amount of bondage, a small amount of whipping, and a certain amount of public nudity . . .The kind of book that leads one to want to read more by these authors, but unfortunately, I haven't found anything else by them.	2005-04-04

Manara's version is set in modern times, and involves two women, and the trouble they get into when one of them ends up with an odd object in their possession. <br /> <br />As a blonde woman rides a little motor scooter along a city street, a man calls out \\"Show me what you've got!\\"  The girl turns, glares and flips him off.  Distracted, the girl ends up driving into a courier on a scooter.  The courier drives off, leaving one package in the street; the girl retrieves the package and takes it home.  Unsure what to do with it, she calls up her friend, a female that wears a red hat throughout the book, and is occasionally attached to a geeky looking guy.  The friend suggests that the blonde should open the box.  Blondie does and finds a long green snake like thing. <br /> <br />After removing her pants, the blonde girl checks herself out in the mirror for injuries.  Suddenly a voice calls out to her.  Apparently it is the long green snake like thing.  The girl raises her shirt at the green snake-like things command, and then strokes the snake.  Out pops a genie like creature which is the spirit of Shiva, blondie's hero (oh, and if it is important at some point, blondie is called Parva).  The nude shimmering spirit thing tells the blonde girl that he could be flesh and blood again.  Blondie wants to help. Apparently, if she passes some tests, she can meet up with the spirit's body during the full moon in August.  Just then, Parva's friends arrive.  Blondie allows Red hat and geeky guy up to her apartment without bothering to put anything like pants on, leaving her half-naked.   <br /> <br />The snake mentions that whoever possesses it is in danger of Kali the Destroyer, and only tantra can protect.  Therefore, blondie and geeky guy end up kissing.  Kissing doesn't seem to be enough, so they have an orgy.  Two beautiful women, one geeky Woody Allen looking guy.  During theorgy, the pictures turn reddish and the people are barely visible. <br /> <br />Suddenly an irate turbaned guy bursts in looking for the package.  Blondie grabs the snake and runs upstairs.  Geeky and red hat hurriedly dress (at least a short skirt and pants).  Finding that she isn't safe hiding upstairs, blondie wraps the snake around her like a belt and runs out into city traffic.  Blondie is now wandering around wearing just a white t-shirt and a green belt.  Without the belt, she is barely covered, with the belt, all is exposed below the waist.  Blondie runs down prostitute alley with angry turban man after her.  To try to disguise herself, she grabs a guy's coat, and when she spots the angry turban man coming, she leaps into the strange man's arms (coat guy, not angry turban man).  Angry turban walks past, blondie attempts to leave, coat guy flips her over, sucks on her, flings her down, and inserts himself into her.  Suddenly red hat arrives and knocks out coat guy. <br /> <br />Blondie and red hat run away, but when red hat realizes that blondie left the coat behind, red hat (Lulu) runs back for it.  Blondie (remember, Parva) hides in the back of a storage container resting on a truck trailer (18-wheeler).  Red hat is captured by turban man and blondie ends up locked up in the back of the trailer, off to who knows where. The container is lifted straight off the trailer and placed on a merchant ship.  Before she knows it, off blondie goes on an ocean voyage.  She pounds on the door, is let out, is fondled and led before a strange fat guy and a nearly naked she-male.  Running from them, she falls overboard, floats to a beach.  Found by nearly nude, but masked and turbaned men and dragged, strangely enough, to where her friend had been lead after her capture.  Another 18 pages of this strange little book. <br /> <br />Overall, a strange little story.  The artwork was good, the plot-line was strange,  the she-male was annoying, but especially annoying was red hat's refusal to ever take off that red hat.  (by the way, that test that the spirit guy mentioned?  it doesn't start until page 52).	2005-04-04
US	14091807	RMYRYNYM9GFKO	159023006X	988028097	Rhapsody	Books	3	15	15	N	N	Collection of stories	Adult Black and white graphic novel/collection of stories. <br /> <br />Rhapsody is a collection of five story sections. <br /> <br />The first section is titled \\"Rhapsody of a Brother and Sister\\" and includes four stories (\\"volumes\\").  The first story involves the brother mooning over a girl, and the sister that is jealousy.  The sister has taken care of the brother since their parents died, and, as she notes: \\"[y]ou need no one but me.\\"  The brother and sister have a very close relationship.  Too close.  The second story involves the brother and sister being too close some more, and a memory of when they found out that their parents had died.  The third story involves the girl the brother likes stopping by the apartment.  The girl and the brother go up to the brother's room, and then the sister calls the brother downstairs, tells him to stay down there and the sister heads to his room.  When the girl refuses to leave the brother alone, the sister sexually attacks the girl: \\"I'll make it so you never show your face in front of my brother again.\\" The last story follows directly on the third.  After the rape, the brother (so far unaware of what really happened), confronts his sister while she is in the shower.  The sister tries to go down on the brother, but he pushes her away.  But that doesn't last.  The artwork in these stories is good, nothing is censored, but the subject matter is off-putting. <br /> <br />The second story section involves a one part story called \\"Our Relationship.\\"  This story involves a very smart, beautiful high school girl, named Saeki, and the girl, named Ryoko, that she \\"stalks.\\"    After learning that Ryoko needs to take a make-up test, Saeki invites herself to become Ryoko's tutor. Ryoko's nervous about the situation.  Then she learns that Saeki, the girl that could get into any university, is intentionally failing her tests so that she could remain in the school with Ryoko.  One thing does not lead to another, as there is no sex and nonudity. <br /> <br />The third story section involves another one part story, this one called \\"A World of Beautiful Women.\\"  This story involves a school club that needs one more member to stay open.  A strange all-female \\"Conjuring Tricks Club,\\" involving bondage.  A woman is stripped, bond and made to join the club (oh, and all this nudity and bondage is occurring outdoors, on what might be school grounds).  Good artwork, good story. <br /> <br />The fourth story section is yet another one part story, this one called \\"Got Milk?\\"  This story involves a man and woman that have been going out for a week.  When the man finds and reads the woman's planner, he finds out that the woman goes out with other men.  The woman spots him reading the planner and begs him to not leave her, and that she will do anything to keep him.  The man asks for milk, the woman brings it, and then an odd sequence of events unfold.  The man shoves the woman over, shoves the milk into one of her holes in her lower body, and basically attacks her.  Interesting little odd story. <br /> <br />The last story section is yet another one parter, and a return to incest, in the story titled \\"Little Sister's Feelings.\\"  Yet again, the brother wants to break off the relationship, and the sister doesn't want to do that (difference being that this time it is an older brother/young sister relationship).  The brother says that he likes one of his sister's girlfriends.  The sister \\"make[s] [his] wish come true.\\"  The brother and the girlfriend enjoy each other while the sister watches.   <br /> <br />Overall, the subject matter was a little too off-putting.  The drawing was good, though hindered by being black and white (and the incest).  Book includes: incest, no censoring, rape (girl on girl), bondage, exhibitism, whipping, and voyeurism.	2005-04-04

While Sheila plays with her slave, we learn that Sheila wants to find a new slave girl, and innocent, because she is bored with the overly experienced Chacha.  We also learn that Sheila and Chacha are aliens, and that Sheila has targeted Earth to find her newest slave (for those that dislike multi-tentacled alien's attacking earth women and the like, these aliens look life female humans). <br /> <br />The second part involves the search for and discovery of Sheila's target, the Earth virgin Ayaka.  Ayaka literally runs into Sheila, and is targeted for slavery.  The three women end up in Ayaka's apartment.  Sheila requests that Ayaka strip, Ayaka refuses and tries to run away, and ends up stripped anyway.   <br /> <br />The third part is titled \\"Enforced Masturbation.\\"  Chacha demonstrates masturbation, and Ayaka is fondled and forced to masturbate.  The book flows along, further humiliating, abusing, penetrating (with a chocolate bar), and enslaving Ayaka.  The further stories include the first kiss, penetration, gym class without a bra and pierced nipples, and self-manipulation. <br /> <br />Overall, the book has good artwork and some good interesting parts, but enjoyment is somewhat hindered by the black & white nature of the book, and the censoring. The book contains: slavery, bondage, rape, some mild censoring (odd, considering the other book by Yuuki that I've read wasn't censored, might be a different Yuuki), fisting, humiliation, piercing, and exhibitism. (overall a rating of 3.992)	2005-04-04

The first story involves a new pet lover doll, a woman dressed up like a rabbit (big floppy ears, tail) entering the house of a man and woman.  The man and woman play with their new, as yet unnamed, female rabbit.  The second Lover Doll story involves the rabbit bound in a cage, and a women dressed like a cat that visits her.  The cat plays with the rabbit until the cat's activity is spotted, and the cat is punished.  The third Lover Doll story is a direct continuation of the second story (and the second two Lover Doll stories should probably have just been one story).  The three Lover Doll stories are interesting but much hampered by the artist's odd desire to cover some of the pictures with lines and heavy shading. <br /> <br />The next three stories are connected and called Physical Labor 1-3.  The first Physical Labor story involves a man and a woman competing over some form of strip video games.  The story opens with the woman up ten games to zero for the man, and the man down to his underwear.  To play another game, the man has to remove his underwear.  As he takes off the underwear, the woman comes up and kisses him, and now sex.  The second Physical Labor story involves a dominate man and a submissive woman engaging in sex, and includes another woman, a tutor, that enters during the action, and who watches.  The last Physical Labor story involves the tutor joining the fun.  These three stories showed some promise, but were just very brief scenes, and that strange shading problem continues. <br /> <br />The next story is called \\"Reiko\\" 1.  This story involves a boy and girl late for morning assembly.  The boy and girl decide to have sex right there outside near the assembly room.  The second \\"Reiko\\" story is placed after a one part story called \\"Night of the Crescent Moon.\\" <br/> <br />\\"Night of the Crescent Moon\\" is a strange fantasy story involving women with wings, dragon like creatures, and sex.  A bandit, a woman with wings, saves a man from a dragon, and requires payment to let the man go.  A very strange story. <br /> <br />The continuation of the \\"Reiko\\" story.  This second story involves a female ghost molesting a boy in a class room. <br /> <br />Overall, a book to avoid. Censoring, relatively weak graphics and an odd decision to have lines (some heavy, some lighter) and shading running over some of the scenes, which is very annoying and largely blocks viewing pleasure (reminder: just some scenes).  Oh, there are some good scenes, but the drawing style and lines running over scenes lowers the overall grade. <br />Book contains, slavery, bondage, humiliation, mild exhibitism.	2005-04-04

A named Don King is sent over to retrieve Pott. <br /> <br />Pott enjoys an evening in a bar in Rangoon, a bar with many barely clothed women.  While Pott waits to catch a glimpse of the new \\"Chinese girl,\\" he fondles two barely clothed women.  Immediately upon laying eyes on her, Pott disengages himself, and hurries over to the new girl, who states that her name is Lulu.  They hook up, leave the bar and enter a taxi.  Lulu is quickly nude, and plays with Pott while the taxi takes them to their destination. The destination?  A communist camp, where Pott is captured, and Lulu reveals that she lured him there.  At the camp, Lulu teases Pott with a striptease show and an orgy, and told that he will never again enjoy such activities. <br /> <br />The scene next shifts to Don King, on the run from mafia hit men in London.  While running along, presumably away from some hit men, Don runs across a woman being raped, and saves her.  While the woman tries to show her gratitude to Don, a bunch of gunmen run up and grab Don.  From the men that capture Don, we learn that the hit men are after Don, because the mafia is worried that he will decline to take over after his grandfather dies.  The mysterious gunmen hire Don King to retrieve Pott for a fee of $50,000. Don King flies to Rangoon, and meets up with a woman from the American Embassy, a certain Fay Harding.  And the end of chapter 1. <br /> <br />After Don and Fay separate, Don hooks up with a \\"professional\\" hooker, and Fay is arrested by the \\"police.\\"  Fay is attacked,  raped, generally abused, and eventually threatened by unwanted touching from two lepers.  Fearing for her future life after such an encounter, Fay leaps out of a window, and that's the end of her.  \\"The boss ... told us just to scare her!\\" <br /><br />Meanwhile, Don has fun with one prostitute and then meets up with Lulu.  While they have some fun, Lulu tries to figure out why the American is in Rangoon (\\"antiques?\\").  After almost being killed after he leaves Lulu's building, Don returns and beats the next contact out of her.  The contact leads Don to Madame Mumu, who will help him . . . (and the story continues, don't want to give everything away). <br /> <br />Overall, the book was more violent than I expected, though it was an interesting story.  The artwork was good, nothing appeared to be censored, and was only somewhat hindered from being a black & white book.  While the book was enjoyable enough, after reading this book, I wasn't inspired to seek out more books by this author.  Book includes: action/adventure, public nudity, bondage, sex, and death.	2005-04-04

Bergman is in some park-like area near a city, waiting for some friends when a strange woman  walks up to him and asks him if he was going to the toy land also.  A man nearby calls over to the girl to bring Giuseppe over to him.  The man explains that he is dying of AIDS, and wants Giuseppe to take care of the girl, because she can't take care of herself.  Giuseppe is told that she isn't stupid, or crazy, just not completely connected with the world around her. <br /> <br />The dying man asks if the girl is nearby, Giuseppe states that she had been reading a book and has now wandered off.  The book is open to a picture of Ophelia drowning herself in a lake.  The dying man tells Giuseppe to hurriedly get over to any nearby body of water, because that is where the girl is likely to be found.  Sure enough, the girl is lying stretched out on her back in a body of water, attempting to recreate the picture she saw in the book.  Giuseppe saves her and tells her that he can't look after her.  When she hears what he says, she pulls out one of her breasts, and states that she wants to pinch her nipple for him, and then proceeds to do so.  Giuseppe grabs the book and spots a picture that is somewhat similar to what she is doing. <br /> <br />A bus is approaching, and the girl, claiming that it is a stagecoach, runs to it and boards.  Giuseppe follows her.  They ride the bus into a city. <br /> <br />When they arrive, the girl separates herself briefly, and when Giuseppe catches up with her, he finds that she has removed her clothes and is sitting with some bikers.  She is attempting to recreate one of the pictures in her book, one showing a nude woman in a park with two men.  Giuseppe tells her to get dressed and begins to leave.  The bikers ask Giuseppe to explain the situation, and he does.  While he is thus distracted, the woman runs naked through the park, past some old men on a park bench.  Giuseppe catches up with the girl, pus a jacket on her, and just then an angry mob rushes by yelling \\"Love and Money!\\" while wearing AA shirts, and waving AA flags (AA = Amour et Argent; it is a political rally).  The book proceeds in a similar fashion for another 34 pages of the girl reenacting something she saw in her book and Giuseppe trying to keep her from harm. <br /> <br />Overall, the artwork is good, though hindered by being in black & white, and has a very strange story-line.  A little too confusing and meaningless. The book contains: exhibitism, jail, and not much else.	2005-04-04

Date is now November 19, 1769.   <br /> <br />In this fourth tale, Janice remembers her life with the Viscount and is interrupted by the need to save Victoria from attempted suicide by drowning after Victoria learns of the Viscounts death.  Janice tries to help Victoria forget the Viscount through some female on female sex.  \\"Shortly thereafter Janice and Victoria leave England . . . \\" and head to Paris.  Oddly enough, Janice and Victoria have decided to enter their new life in Paris, away from the \\"old\\" one in England, by turning up wearing some lovely dresses that leave their breasts exposed.  Janice and Victoria find that they haven't left their old life, and are tied up and whipped by her new Paris \\"friends.\\" <br /> <br />Meanwhile, in London, two lovers agree to avenge the Viscount's death by going after Janice. One of whom is the man who originally took Janice out of prison (and who later gave her to the Viscount).  The trail along behind her. <br /> <br />After their strange night in Paris, Janice and Victoria leave, and board ship in Marseilles bound for Genoa.  While on board the ship, their ship is attacked by pirates, and Janice and Victoria are captured, and maltreated. Later they are offered at a slave auction and a sheik buys Victoria.  Janice isn't wanted at that slave auction, as evidence shows that she has been heavily used.   She is lead to another one, one where the customers can try the merchandise.  The British arrive, and Janice and Victoria are \\"saved\\" by the two English lovers who have been trailing Janice, and the expanded party heads to Venice . . .  (story continues) <br /> <br />The drawing is good, and nothing appears to have been censored.  Much bondage, whipping, punishment, humiliation, sexual activity, slavery, death, and dominance.  <br /> <br />The plot is somewhat strong, and a certain amount of work went into including hints that Janice is actually in 1769.  Overall, a good story.	2005-03-30

Forte owns the Stratosphere in Las Vegas, and is, according to a tip, trying to take over the internet gambling market.   <br /> <br />Paul Forte's real impact in the criminal business world involves running a specialty casino in the section of the Stratosphere that is supposedly closed.  The specialty: a casino for wealthy gamblers with a taste for sadistic entertainment.  For example: the drinks cart has a bound nude woman inside, the display statutes are actually real women, etc.  A lot of naked and bound women, or bound in special uniforms, are on display and anything goes.  The women: illegal aliens, mostly Russian, or women trapped in the legitimate casino, including a woman named Becky. <br /> <br />Becky and Jerry eloped to Las Vegas, to the casino known for \\"extending credit to anyone with a library card.\\"  Jerry lost big, and now Becky has to pay by becoming a slave in the special casino. <br /> <br />The winner of the SIGNY \\"Best Bondage Writer\\" award, whatever that is, certainly knows how to write.  Unfortunately, the continuous lengthy descriptions of women being bound begin to become a little boring, though there is action.  Despite that fault, the book is still an interesting BDSM novel.	2005-03-30

In this case, the young girls, debutantes, are not shown off at balls and court to find a husband, but to find an \\"owner.\\"  These high-class women undergo a period of severe training, and then face the ball season.  A season when barely clad young women service the guests under the dinner table, are whipped while chained to walls and pillars and serve as tables and ottomans, and are otherwise played with against their will.   <br /> <br />Lady Lucinda and Angela Carstairs enter this world and find pleasure and pain, and a lot of humiliation.  Lord Randolph Southdean, Lady Anais Fakenham and Valencia Dacourt are the main characters on the side of \\"owners.\\" <br /> <br />Twenty-one year old Angela Carstairs' parents were eaten by lions in 1941, and she has spent a most of her life in a boarding school in Birmingham.  Now she has traveled from Birmingham to visit her Aunt Anais and Uncle George (George being something of a second cousin to her father) in London, and visit the \\"good life.\\"  Almost immediately on meeting her Aunt Anais, Angela begins to learn that she has entered a different world than what she is used to, or expected.  When she arrives at Aunt Anais' home, a maid, Mary, lets them into the house and Aunt Anais notes that Mary will still receive her punishment, whipping by cane on bare flesh. Angela can't believe what is happening, and eventually speaks out \\"I don't think you should be whipping her . . .\\" and learns that she has truly entered a new world.  The Aunt states that if that is the way Angela feels, well, then Angela will receive the rest of the whippings.  Afterwards, Angela is led to her room, where she strips and has her clothes are burned.  The trunk she had brought with her on the trip down did not make the final voyage to the house, and so, she must wear what is given her. Her season is just about to start.  Scenes at a training school (where Angela meets up with Lady Lucinda, or Lucy), at balls and at various homes occur throughout the book.  Including one scene where Angela is used as a table, naked except for stockings and evening gloves, with an ashtray and two glasses on the small of her kneeling back. <br /> <br />Along with Mary, various servants fill out the minor characters and one somewhat major character, that of a male named Jem.  Jem has just joined in this world as a servant, and whose sections are easily skipped, unless you like the subservient male receiving beatings and the like. <br /> <br />Lady Lucinda has no desire to go through a `season,' but will do so, because she is told that being a `debutante' in this world will be her only way of reaching the side she is very interested in.  Lucinda really likes dominating the servants, and wants to get her hands on the debutantes.  Lucinda's fiery temper and large ego are overcome on numerous occasions, but never really tamed (at least that is what she claims).  <br /> <br />Overall, while the book is obviously not for everyone, it was quite good in my opinion.  The book flowed along, only bogging down occasionally when some scenes are drawn out too long, and when the need arises to skip certain sections.  Includes humiliation, bondage, whipping . . .	2005-03-30

Special Agent Mallory Channing (40) is an experienced agent, and 28 year-old Kip Palazzi is inexperienced.  <br /> <br />Despite standard operating procedures calling for the FBI to take over a case once its agents are on the scene, an arrangement has been made where Sheriff Lonigen will remain in overall charge and the agents will provide assistance, as needed (page 7). The assistance: handling the press, re-interviewing the contacts and generally helping out in the squad room including manning the phones. Kip Palazzi, handling the phones, receives a tip : \\"If they wanted to find the blonde chick they should check out a boat called Big Wizz off Sycamore point.\\" Palazzi and Mallory are the only ones in the office when the tip comes in, and seeing their chance for some real work, immediately head to the marina, without leaving word of their activities.  <br /> <br />The agents rent a boat and head out to near the Big Wizz (a large yacht), and act as if they were just tourists sunbathing on the water (and as neither brought a swimsuit, that involves a certain amount of nudity).  When the agents spot some men leaving Big Wizz on a small boat, they head over to the yacht and go on-board.  As the agents wander through the ship, they head toward some soft moans, and are captured and restrained.  They eventually find out that the moans had been coming from the barely clothed Meghan, restrained, and hanging in a room on the boat. <br /> <br />Despite protests that they are Federal agents and that those on board are in trouble with the law, the Big Wiz's Captain (Captain Thompson) takes the boat out into international waters, and heads down to South America.  On the way, the Captain and crew play with their captives.  Arriving in South America, the three women are sold to a representative (Major Guzman) of a guerrilla leader(General Hernandez).  The representative leads the women along a long trail up into the mountains, and eventually reaches the guerrilla camp. <br /> <br />Overall, Winslow's book is interesting, the plot has some holes, and the characterization of the major characters is good.  The book contains Humiliation/rape/nc/white slavery.	2005-03-30

The book starts out by noting that as a child, Joy was constantly being whipped by her aggressive father as punishment.  Joy constantly fought back, got into trouble, and was whipped. Her mother, on the other hand, was submissive.  We learn through the flow of the book, that Joy followed neither her father's nor her mother's inclination in adulthood. Joy ended up with traces of both traits.  Somewhat similar to the lead woman in Ann Rice's \\"Exit to Eden,\\" who ran a d/s island as a dominant, but who had a submissive past and submissive urges.  As the book unfolds, Joy, herself will find out that she likes to dominate others, and, when forced, can find pleasure in the submissive position.     One of Joy's best friends, Lydia, was a prostitute.  Despite Joy's belief that what Lydia did was wrong, \\"abused her womanhood,\\" she rather liked Lydia, so much so that they ended up sleeping together.  On the other hand, Joy could never see herself sleeping with a man, and so, while she envied Lydia's ability to afford nice clothes, she could not go for the \\"easy money\\" directly.  Joy, Lydia and a real estate agent client of Lydia's got together an idea to buy and run a brothel, with Joy as the madam.   The property found was away from neighbors and came with an interesting basement with many bondage and torture devices.  They could make big money from that basement, though a more straight forward prostitution business would occur upstairs.    The business boomed, Joy ran numerous girls and the basement was used profitably.  In the meantime, Joy found herself dominating others, and being dominated by another.  This state of affairs continued until a new girl arrived, but we do not want to give away all the details.      The book contains domination, submission, bondage, torture, and humiliation.  The plot is straight forward enough, while there were some twists and turns, there is nothing unexpected.  Altogether, the plot, characters, and setting (not sure where everything tookplace (of course the book opens noting that \\"The streets of any big city are pretty much all the same . . ,\\" so it probably doesn't matter where the action is occurring, though some description would have been nice, would have grounded the story and made it less words on paper) nor time period, though the fact that Lydia was a $3 hooker was somewhat interesting, and possible clue) were shallow.  Nice 160 paperback pages of action, but in the end, neither particularly memorable nor remarkable.	2005-03-28

Full-color adult graphic novel.   <br /> <br />As the introduction notes, this story takes place in a parallel universe where women are second class citizens (or no-class citizens as they have no rights, and are seen as \\"inferior creatures\\").  Madoline is a woman in this parallel world.  She is married to Robert and her mother-in-law lives in the same house.  Madoline wears skimpy clothing and sleeps around with strange men.  The mother-in-law uses the law to blackmail Madoline and eventually send her to a correctional facility where the female inmates are placed in brutal bondage.  Robert reacts negatively to these developments and sends his mother off to the correctional facility. <br /> <br />Mother and daughter-in-law are branded and treated very cruelly.  An odd little opening into this world is found by a man from our world (or at least a world where women have more rights).  He wanders in and frees two of the women in the prison.  The mother-in-law refuses to leave the prison; she believes that she deserves to be there.  All is not well, though . . . <br /> <br />The story involves brutal torture, and bondage.  The novel is well-drawn, though the women in it are not all the best looking women in the world. <br /> <br />There is at least one sequel (English language version copyright 1997, and oddly enough, titled Madoline Volume 2).	2005-03-28

The first story involves a rape gang, and the girls attempt to \\"get them.\\"  The gang members rape girls, take pictures and blackmail the girls.  The twin spark girls try to fight the gang's activities. Unfortunately, the artwork includes some censoring.  The second and third stories are linked and also include rape and a gang, though this one is a motorcycle gang.  The fourth story involves a new girl at school who is strong and slutty.<br /><br />The first non-Twin Spark Girls story is a strange look into warring states and some form of science or fantasy adaptation of human arms, modifying them to be cannons (guns).  The story involves two of these modified humans with the ability to turn their arms into cannons.  One of them is male, the other female.  They find a connection. The second non-Twin Spark Girls story is also about humans with guns for arms.  A very strange and disturbing story. The third non-Twin Spark Girls story is set back in the samurai days.  Two samurai fight over a woman.  Quite violent and bloody. The fourth non-Twin Spark Girls story involves strange demon women that are looking for the sperm genie. The fifth non-TSG story is yet another strange story.  This one involves the shadow world and someone from that world's attempted take over of the outside world.<br /><br />The Twin Spark Girls stories are good but the non-TSG stories are a little too wierd and violent.<br /><br />Twin Spark Girls: well-drawn, hindered by black and white format.  The girls wander around wearing very short skirts and full sweaters.	2005-03-28

Lilian Cunnington's mother died in Lilian's birth and Lilian's father committed suicide.  Lilian was raised by her aunts.  The aunts take pleasure in punishing Lilian, and pleasuring themselves, but the time has come and Lilian must go to witch school.   <br /> <br />Lilian is delivered to this special school and her powers are immediately tested.  Oddly enough, despite not knowing her gifts, her natural abilities appear to be quite strong.  At the school, Lilian and her classmates (all female) are taught the history of their witch order.  Lilian is told that men are more or less evil (or at least want to hold women down) and her classmates try to force her into lesbianism. At the school Lilian develops a rivalry with another student, Agatha.  They fight, they bicker, they kiss.   <br /> <br />To reinforce the evilness of men, the teachers at her school have her raped by some men.  Later they seduce a young man she fancies and let Lilian find him in an orgy.   <br /> <br />The drawing is good, though hindered by being black & white (oddly enough, some later volumes are in color, and are somewhat hindered by being in color as some of the black and white shading were carried forward to the color versions and obscure the pictures).  The plot is ok, and some hints are left to indicate the setting.  The characterization and personalities of the main characters are quite developed, though rather shallow for the side characters.	2005-03-28

Not a cast of thousands, but certainly crowded. <br /> <br />Dr. Fez desires Claudia, but is rebuffed. After learning about a new invention, and believing that Claudia is a little too uncomfortable about her body and her sexuality, Dr. Fez acquires this new invention and uses it on Claudia.  Claudia is kidnapped and has a \\"receiver\\" surgically implanted in her brain.  A transmitter is used to send signals to the receiver, and the receiver sends signals to certain nerve endings in the brain that cause Claudia to become incredibly horny, depending on the transmitter setting. <br /> <br />After Claudia returns from being kidnapped (\\"Your wife turns out not to have been kidnapped . . .\\" said by Crow; she says that she fell down and doesn't remember what happened), Dr. Fez uses the device in numerous situations. Claudia is attacked by the transmitter and driven rather uncontrollably horny at the mall while trying on clothes, at a party at her home, while in her bedroom in front of the butler, and at the movie theater in front of her husband.  The husband is understandably annoyed when his wife starts sucking the man in the seat next to them in the theater, and then enjoying a good screw with the guy against the theater wall.  They go to a doctor, find out about the doctor informs them about his stolen invention, and Claudia goes on vacation (a cruise) until they can find the transmitter.  The \\"man\\" followed Claudia.  Claudia tries to get further away by going to the mountains, and is followed again.   <br /> <br />The first book has a solid plot, good characterization, and is well-drawn.   <br /> <br />Click 2: <br /> <br />Claudia is now a reporter (or anchor) on \\"SOS Planet.\\"  A strange man calls into the show about finding a transmitter in the Alps that controlled a woman.  Soon afterwards, the man turns up at the studio, and the games start again.  Specifically, they start in the studio's men's restroom.  Claudia ends up forced to ride her bicycle through traffic without pants (or anything else on the lower body).  It would appear that Claudia's old husband is trying to get her into trouble.  At one point, the man with the transmitter sets it to maximum and points it at the television screen.  Claudia then is lost at sea for ten days.  After being found, an interesting tape turns up. <br /> <br />The second book has a somewhat less solid plot, good characterization, and is well-drawn. <br /> <br />The third book in this collection is Click 3.   <br /> <br />The third book involves a religious figure in the Amazon that believes that he could use the energy of a woman at the edge of orgasm to communicate with aliens.  Claudia visits this man and attempts to stop him but becomes entangled in his activities.   <br /> <br />The third book is about the same level of quality as the second book, which is slightly worse than the first book.  The characters have personality, there's a somewhat more solid plot than the second book, and the series continues to be well-drawn. <br /> <br />Overall, the collection includes scenes of humiliation, sex, and whipping.	2005-03-28

Kayo has transferred to another college, but the alien invaders follow her. <br /> <br />Still a strange series, but oddly enough, this book is much better than its predecessor. The book begins strongly, starts to fade, but mostly has few bad chapters.  Series continues to involve lots of alien monster rape of women, transformation of humans, violence and sex.  Be warned, the Japanese anime/manga style tends to suddenly inject she-males into the mix.  Because of the nature of the aliens, there are occasions when those types of scenes are mimic'd.  No actual she-males are involved in this series (as far as I know), but there are scenes where that fact might be hard to remember (because of alien tentacles). <br /> <br />The series is still hindered by being in black and white.  Despite that hindrance, the characters are well drawn, and mostly attractive.  Still overall, the book is still rather violent, strange and falls a little too far into that \\"erotic grotesque\\" category.	2005-03-28

Full-Colored adult graphic novel. <br /> <br />The story of a girl named Twenty around the year 2018 (2018 when she goes to that strange school).  The book begins with Twenty visiting an old class friend, Mandy, and remembering the past.  Twenty has left her husband, and she tells Mandy the story of why she has has left him.  The story begins when she arrives at a new strange finishing school, a school where young women are prepared for the new sexual revolution.  <br /> <br />Twenty is 18 but inexperienced.  She is going to a new school in this post-aids world and finds that the school takes sexual education very seriously and requires participation.  She first learns this strange nature of the school when she meets the headmistress and a fellow student in the head's office.  Both are wearing rather revealing clothing (though the nature of the headmistress' clothing is less obvious).  The required student uniform, it would appear, is a short-sleeve short white shirt that just barely falls to mid-breast, and a rather short split skirt (skirt split up both sides to waistband).  Any movement, and all is revealed.  Twenty puts on her new school uniform and joins in school activities. <br /> <br />Beyond learning about sex in school, Twenty joins her friend Mandy off-campus, while still wearing their uniforms.  Oddly enough, they are wearing more clothing than some people they spot on the streets.  Apparently, the elimination of aids has caused all to wear skimpy clothing and have sexual adventures with many partners. <br /> <br />The two girls go to many places off-campus, and have some fun.  Twenty finds out that people are inclined to take liberties, and touch all who pass by.  Eventually they head to a strip club.  Twenty ends up on stage.  At this club, Twenty meets her future husband for the first time.  <br /> <br />While her sexual education continues at the finishing school by day, by night Twenty goes out with Gilbert.  Gilbert strongly encourages Twenty to explore the people around them. Eventually Gilbert hands her off to his friend Simon, who leads Twenty to a castle like building.  Simon introduces his wife Rachel, who is found naked standing up with arms bond above her . . .  And now some bondage scenes.  <br /> <br />Twenty's story is interrupted and she is kidnapped.   <br /> <br />The drawing is rather good, nothing appears to be censored.  Much bondage, whipping, punishment, sexual activity, and dominance.	2005-03-28

Manara's take on the Swift story of Gulliver's Travels, this time with a woman who has trouble staying clothed.  The story starts with a young woman, whose name is Gullivera, doing some nude sunbathing on a raft on the ocean.  She falls asleep on the raft, falls off, losing both the raft and her bathing suit.  She swims out to an old looking ship that has been anchored nearby for a week without any activity.  The girl finds an old British flag, makes a dress out of it, and finds a copy of Gulliver's Travels on the ship.  As she begins to read it, a storm comes up and knocks the ship off its anchor, and off they go, ship and girl.    Gullivera ends up lying on a beach, tied down.  She has entered the land of the Lilliputians.  Gullivera helps the Lilliputians in a war, puts out a fire with a different type of liquid source, and eventually leaves and finds her ship, undamaged.  The ship takes her to a land of giants, including vicious giant rats, and giant humans, a brother and sister who find and capture her.  Next, Gullivera very briefly visits the land of horny talking horses (the horses might have been in one panel).    After fleeing the horses, Gullivera finds a floating city in the sky, filled with horny women, and sleeping men.  The men can't be roused except by loud noises, and . .. Fleeing the \\"pervs,\\" Gullivera returns home.    Oddly enough, the Swift story, on occasion, had more erotic scenes (and more disturbing).    Includes nudity, and whipping.

The women go to the man's house and the man \\"treats\\" both of them. <br /> <br />The seventh story is titled \\"The One and Only `Miss Breasts'.\\"  A man likes looking down a particular woman's blouse, and ends up giving away a large amount of his items, like a computer, for the chance to look down the woman's blouse as she bends over to pick up the items. <br /> <br />The eighth story involves a story called \\"The Boss' Wife\\" and involves a man that makes out with his boss' wife while the boss sleeps drunkenly on the bed next to them. <br /> <br />The last story is called \\"End of the Century Couple.\\"  A woman finds out that her husband cheated on her.

(Labeled: \\"Graphic Novel/Erotic/Horror/Manga\\"; \\"ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN\\").<br /><br />Similar to the Maeda's Demon Invasion books.  This series was turned into a Japanese animation film.<br /><br />Most of the main characters return in this sequel. The returning characters include: Miko, a ninja and university student, Miko's sister Miyu, Miko's small ninja friend Nin Nin, and tentacled demons.<br /><br />In this book, Miko meets a new enemy, the \\"Suzukasan Style Ninja Clan.\\"  If this clan can defeat Miko, they will gain control of the demons and rule earth.  The Suzukasan Clan try to overcome Miko by using sex to weaken her.<br /><br />This strange book, like its predecessor, is filled with rape, aliens, and violence. The series is subjectively better than his Demon Invasion series, though still hindered by being in black in white. Overall, the characters are well drawn, have actual personalities, and the book has a strong, though sometimes strange plot.	2005-03-28
US	14091807	R1NDRRIU5ESHHT	0867194456	71075553	Troubles of Janice 2 (Pt. 2)	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Interesting book	Colored adult graphic novel. <br /> <br />The first Janice book (not included) involved a twenty-two year-old Janice, who was in prison for life for the crime of abortion. One day she was informed, by the Prison Governor, that an experimental change in the law is taking place.  Janice left prison with a gentleman, Viscount Vauxhall who will \\"rehabilitate\\" her.  Viscount Vauxhall whips her, brands her, plays with her at orgy parties. <br /> <br />In this sequel, the story date is still 1766, and Janice is still in England under the control of Viscount Vauxhall.   <br /> <br />In this second tale, Janice finds herself at an orgy party, but wearing a chastity belt.  She is there to give pleasure, not to receive it.  Later she is set up with a Lord Mitchcombe to become his wife (and one of the few times where the women in public are fully clothed).  They marry, but all is not well. <br /> <br />A local reverend takes advantage of Janice, the husband finds out, and Janice, the victim, is seen as the evil one. Janice's past is revealed, and the husband treats her harshly. He sends her with the reverend back to the viscount for some adjustments (the viscount's brand V is adjusted to an M; among other things). Janice returns to her husband, who \\"rents\\" her out.  Her old lover turns up . . . <br /> <br />Interesting clothing.  The women tend to go about in public wearing long dresses and with their breasts either exposed or just barely covered.   <br /> <br />The drawing is good; the branding is censored (along with some other odd choices).  Much bondage, whipping, punishment, branding, sexual activity, and dominance.  <br /> <br />The plot is strong, and a certain amount of work went into including hints that Janice is actually in 1766.  Overall, a good story.	2005-03-28

Unfortunately, this is the weakest book in the series.  Claudia's husband (same one from before, even though they had apparently separated after the first book (\\"Click 1\\")), a lawyer, represents Globalchem in a lawsuit over Methylene alcohol being used in food, causing people to go blind.  The son and daughter (the sister being a little too causal about being nude in front of her brother, and the brother being a little too accommodating by shaving her and the like) of one of the victims decide to try to ruin Globalchem's lawyer by getting/using Claudia. <br /> <br />After failing miserably on their own, Dr. Fez contacts them to offer his help (actually, he contacted them before that, but the female didn't believe him).   Apparently he has made a transmitter himself, even though he lost the first one in the first book, and by the end of that book thought that it was a fraud.  His notes allowed him to create a better transmitter (strange, he didn't make the transmitter to begin with, and he never seemed to take any notes; he was a medical doctor, nothing previously implied that he was also an engineer or an inventor). <br /> <br />The fourth book in the series is somewhat off putting by the addition of edge of incest-like activity, though the drawing is still good. The plot is somewhat silly, and the characters are a little shallower than previous books.  <br /> <br />Overall, the book includes scenes at the edge of incest, a certain level of humiliation, and a certain small amount of sex.	2005-03-28

(Labeled: \\"Graphic Novel/Erotic/Horror/Manga\\"; \\"ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR CHILDREN\\"). <br /> <br />An alien invasion of a Japanese University.  The aliens attempt to impregnate the females to conquer the world.  Main character is a female student named Kayo. Kayo is somewhat helped by a male friend named Tamotsu. <br /> <br />Strange book that begins slowly, has at least one good chapter and then sputters to a disappointing ending.  Contains a lot of alien monster rape of women, transformation of humans, violence and sex. <br /> <br />While hindered by being in black and white, the characters are well drawn, and mostly attractive.  Overall, the book is a little to violent and falls too far into the \\"erotic grotesque\\" category.	2005-03-28
