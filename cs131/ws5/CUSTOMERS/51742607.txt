That's a great program, based on well-accepted science, for a 12 week jumpstart to fitness, nutrition, weight loss, looking and feeling good. <br /> <br />The minor problems with Phillip's approach, in my view, were that it was a bit rigid and becoming slightly dated on a couple points. <br /> <br />Lean Body Promise, I feel, is as good as Body for Life, and improves on it in several ways: <br /> <br />- First, it is ALMOST identical to Body for Life.  In fact, the author cites Phillips in his acknowledgements.   <br /> <br />- While both are highly motivational and nicely written, I felt Phillips is a little over the top in some of the emotional fluff -- Labrada strikes a bit better balance <br /> <br />- The strength programs are both split routines.  Phillips uses an upper body / lower body split.  Labrada uses a push, pull, legs split.  Phillips does an ascending half pyramid with a super set at the end.  Labrada uses 3 sets of 10 reps on 2 exercises per muscle group.  These are both perfectly valid and widely used approaches to strength training.  I prefer Labrada's mainly because I don't have to change the weights every set!  But overall, you're doing about 6 sets per muscle group with a minute of rest in each program. <br /> <br />- The CV programs are both interval training.  Phillips is 20 minutes with 5 different settings, changing every minute.  Labrada does a 26 minute routine with 3 levels changing less frequently.  Again, both are extremely effective and time efficient, but I slightly prefer Labrada's because you're not constantly changing the machine level every minute. <br /> <br />- Diet is extremely similar too.  5-6 meals, spread every few hours.  A palm of lean protien, a fist of whole grain carbs, some veggies... A shake or a bar when you're rushed.  Phillips prescribes 1 cheat day per week.  Labrada prescribes 2 cheat meals per week.  Very similar.  This REALLY works though -- takes a couple weeks to get used to, but you don't feel hungry and you get fast results.  And it's not a half-baked fad -- this is good science of a balanced healthy diet you can live with long term. <br /> <br />- Rotation of workouts: Phillips alternates cv and strength each day, with 1 off-day per week.  Labrada does 2 strength then 1 cv, with a suggestion that you fill in an extra cv or 2 per week on light strength days.  He doesn't build in a day off, but assumes you might miss a day here and there, in which case you pick up where you left off.  I like that approach a lot -- there's some built in flexibility to add the cv when you can fit it in.  There isn't a fixed expectation that you can schedule your off day perfectly.   <br /> <br />Again, I like the notion that Labrada builds in that you're going to miss a day here and there.  That you might be faced with only unhealthy meal choices at a party some time.  Etc.  And he gives specific suggestions on dealing with those.  He also gives suggestions on dealing with the desire to overdo it at times.  Phillips, while also excellent, prescribes more rigidly and as a result doesn't build in a lot of information on how to recover from speedbumps. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great program that you're absolutely going to see results on if you follow, and hopefully can make an ongoing lifestyle change using.   <br /> <br />You can't go wrong with Phillips either, but I think this one's a little easier to stick with and will give the same results.	2005-08-02

They should have been articles instead of books. <br /> <br />This book, however, is absolutely brimming with valuable information about the psyche of kids, chapter after chapter.  It starts with ever-present needs; moves into fads; gender specific issues; age based issues; etc etc.   <br /> <br />It draws on the authors extensive hands on experience at Ogilvy working with kids marketing.

I've been in the fitness industry for over a decade, and of all the programs out there, I keep coming back to Body for Life as one of the most sound and accessible programs.  It is based on solid principles -- nothing \\"far out\\" or particularly controversial.  Just solid science nicely packaged in a manageable amount of exercise and a sustainable nutrition program.   <br /> <br />For my personal taste, the \\"rah rah\\" motivational parts of the original book were a bit over the top.  I sort of extracted the program elements from the book and follow those, and skipped over the rah rah.  If that's how you were too, you're not going to really like the journal.  You're better off downloading the plain workout and diet tracking sheets from the website and using those (or making your own version).   <br /> <br />If, however, you loved the emotional side of the book and you're a big fan of day-to-day inspirational stories and such to keep you on track, you'll love it. <br /> <br />So 4 stars for being what it sets out to be (even if that strikes me as corny...) <br />	2005-05-20

I found it very insightful as someone coming in from a related but different field.  His insights resonate as being intuitive and on target.   <br /> <br />There's a little bit of defensiveness of the industry which seemed off track though.  The basic thesis is that any learning is good learning and playing games is about learning.  That's fine, but I'm not sure it's a great argument -- it begs a reasonable countargument of \\"yes, but what about learning something more productive.\\"  All in all, the book would stand on its own merits as a great synthesis of the field without this defensiveness and is well worth the read and 5 stars. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-10

I didn't particularly like it and I didn't particularly get good at understanding music -- I got good at fingering specific pieces. <br /> <br />I would have, in retrospect, preferred the method of learning and understanding the chords so I could pick up pieces on my own.  The idea of \\"fake\\" books is to improvise the harmony based on the chords and play the to melody line along with it.  By learning the chords and some ways of stringing them together, you can master just about anything.   <br /> <br />It's not that simple -- it's a lot of practice to be able to turn chords on the sheet into realtime music.  But it's a lot of fun, and I actually \\"get it\\" now on how music is put together. <br /> <br />This book in particular is well written, bringing you quickly to understand how to do this.  It assumes basic ability to read music.  And it is slightly corny in parts.  But aside from that, its a nice self-paced tutorial into playing from \\"fake\\" books or other sheet music that includes chord information.	2004-10-02

It's more of a business book than a sports book, focusing on the market inefficiency in baseball created by old-timers using intuition about how to draft and trade players.   <br /> <br />It follows a great story line about the Oakland A's, who with 1/3 of the budget of the top spenders routinely finish up near the top, by taking a more statistically based approach to selecting players and spending their budget.  It reads like a novel though, in part because Lewis is a good writer, and in part because of the material (Billy Beane, Oakland's GM, in particular is a character). <br /> <br />I enjoyed it thoroughly -- it heightened my interest in baseball, and it made me look at markets in general with an eye towards seeking inefficiencies and opportunities in a new light. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-27

The problem is that almost any change you make can result in short term benefits, but many changes are not sustainable and you'll actually wind up worse off than when you started on some of these fad diets or unbalanced exercise programs. <br /> <br />Phillips program, however, is very sensible -- a low fat diet, with frequent smaller meals.  Plus one day off a week to keep you sane and keep your metabolism up.  There's plenty of science to back the program up.  And he doesn't go overboard on the tracking and calculating calories.  Just some simple rules of thumb. <br /> <br />This gets combined with a strength and cv program that are fairly high intensity.  That could be challenging for some, but in general, they're pretty time efficient so worth the tradeoff.  The CV program uses interval training which is highly effective and efficient.  The strength program is an ascending half pyramid plus one super set at the end of each muscle group.  It's not the only way to go, but it is certainly a solid and efficient protocol, solidly backed up by other researchers. <br /> <br />The only slight turnoffs are a lot of rah-rah emotional stuff in the book that I could have done with less of, and a minor pitch to buy protein bars from EAS.   <br /> <br />But otherwise, this is a very solid and effective program.  In a few months on it, I've built muscle mass and lost weight, and I'm confident anyone sticking with the program will do the same.	2004-09-17

It will probably annoy lovers of people like Bill O'Reily, Rush Limbaugh and the like, but if you're somewhat liberal to middle-of-the-road, or conservative but open to hearing the other view, you will really enjoy this and learn from it.  <br />You'll learn from it because unlike most in this business, Franken really does his research.  He had a team of interns from Harvard working on all the facts for this.  The 2 effects of this are (1) he gets his facts straight which is refreshing, and (2) the content is very valuable -- for instance, the chapter &quot;Operation Ignore&quot; on the Bush Administration's approach to the terrorism threat covers Richard Clarke and his  warnings well before he became popular news with his new book and the 9-11 hearings recently.<br />You'll enjoy it because Franken is so darn funny.  Most who do the research that he does would write a fairly dry, scholarly book.  Franken goes the extra mile to package the information in a very amusing way.  It's great to laugh your way through something while learning so much.<br />Finally, I have the book and the tape version.  I read most of the book first and then switched to the tapes.  The book is great, but the tapes are even better because Franken does the reading himself and his sense of timing and comedic delivery makes the whole thing even better.	2004-03-28

For those who are just after the answers, read something else.  But I found many of the stories fascinating.  How did they figure out the weight and size of the earth?

I'd add one point and correct one:<br />The correction is that the review says the routine doesn't create the calorie deficit needed for weight loss.  That's right.  But immediate calorie deficit isn't the basis for weight loss associated with strength training.  The idea is that over time, strength training increases lean body mass (muscle) which the body uses more calories to maintain, even at rest.  Strength training increases baseline metabolism.  CV exercise by contrast burns calories at the time, and that's it.  Strength training doesn't do much at the time of the exercise (relative to cv) but gives you an ongoing burn rate instead.<br />The addition is that even though these routines are demonstrated to be effective, they are very hard to stick with.  It is hard for most people to subject themselves to that feeling of muscle burn on a slow lift to failure.  Even though it's less time efficient, most people are better served by a more traditional workout that they stick with long term, than a more perfect routine they can't stick with.	2003-12-04

I've been in the industry for over a decade and am quite familiar with the research. <br />Slow lifting techniques are in fact well researched and effective.  The reason for weight loss associated with strength training is not from the direct calorie consumption from the activity, but rather from the increase in metabolism from having more muscle for the body to support, which takes more calories to do even at rest.  CV exercise burns calories at the time of exercise.  Strength training gradually raises your baseline metabolism.<br />Athletes don't use this routine because for sports training you're supposed to exercise in the way the muscles will be used for the sport you're training for.  Football and basketball players for instance train at lift speeds that would be considered dangerous to most exercisers -- they need to train the muscles for explosive motion.<br />The problem with these slow protocols isn't their science, it's that they're tough to stick with.  Try lifting a weight at a very slow speed to failure while your muscle is burning.  It's more painful than most other techniques.  Most people, as a result, tend to prefer a less efficient but more sustainable form of a couple sets at a couple seconds per rep a few times a week.	2003-12-01

This is such a beautiful book.  It gives hope and comfort.  The takeaway is simple:  &quot;I'm a scientist trained in scientific method, I truly believe that past lives are confirmed by this set of experiences, therefore its now okay to believe in this.&quot;<br />The takeaways from the book are not unlike the takeaways from eastern philosophies/religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, etc.  I found myself very moved while reading it and desparately wanting to believe.  <br />Problems started arising for me afterwards though.  First, to believe should truly be life changing, so its not just a &quot;nice idea, let me add it to my repetoire&quot; kind of book.  <br />So based on that, second, as Carl Sagan says, &quot;extraordinary claims requir extraordinary proof.&quot;  In this, the author falls short.  <br />For instance, he claims his subject started becoming psychic.  I am genuiunely eager to belive his claims in the book, but if his subject were psychic there are objective scientifically controlled tests he can put her through to demonstrate this and conclusively prove to a skeptical audience his claims.  The anecdotal evidence of hearsay about picking winners at the track is quite a letdown from a supposed scientifically trained author.  <br />Had the author not made such bold assertions about his scientific credentials to be making these claims, this wouldn't really be an issue.  Leaps of faith are everywhere in these belief systems.  But since he claims to be using scientific method and trying to appeal to those of us that want to go on more than just blind faith, he ultimately disappoints.  <br />Beautifully written and inspiring, but this is no more scientific than the Bhagavad Gita, and the conclusions are roughly similar.	2003-11-13

In his intros he says this book treats religions with respect, and doesn't focus on the mis-implementation of certain ideas.  He does this throughout.  There are no value judgments on how followers have misused a given religion's ideas.  It's just a pure presentation of the each religion in all its beauty and grandeur.<br />2. In the title he calls these our &quot;wisdom traditions&quot;.  That's right on.  Religion, at least as I think of it with rites and ceremonies, is too narrow a view of what he conveys.

This book is full of takeaway messages that will allow you to approach mastering something, anything (a sport, an art, a language, you name it) more effectively.<br />There are two big messages, and a lot of support:<BR>1. The reason for mastery -- he compelling argues that it doesn't matter so much what you choose to master, pick something and pursue mastery.  It has a life changing effect. <br />2. The process for mastery -- this is very compelling.  He takes the concept of a plateau and makes it understandable.  And shows how to reach mastery given the realities of what happens along the way.  We're bad at this in today's world -- we want results right away.  But that's not how it works.  Committing to the process not the outcomes goes back to ancient Eastern religions, and its as true for modern life and success as well.  <br />He's distilled a lifetime of learning into a very short and useful read.	2003-11-12

Things learned not in school but through life experiences, Carl distills down into a set of practical advice, as given to his college bound son.  <br />The beauty of this book, relative to the wealth of &quot;self help&quot; books out there, is its complete coverage of &quot;things you need to know&quot; instead of just being about one topic like public speaking or negotiations or money or relationships.  Its almost a &quot;best of&quot;, short and sweet, targeted to a particular life stage.  And Carl's advice rings true throughout.<br />An ideal gift for a high school or college grad, but also for any age there are lessons for us, and for our kids.	2003-08-27

He does a great job of explaining the beauty of the different religions and the underlying rationale for them and what we might take away from each (even if you don't care to practice that religion per se -- he gets to each's &quot;wisdom&quot;).<br />He steers away from the ways in which actual implementation of the religions cause problems.  For instance, he covers why a caste system could theoretically make sense, if implemented the way the religion had intended it to be -- but points out only briefly that it is not.<br />In all this is an excellent overview of the major religions, put in a way that an adherent to any religion would likely like seeing their religion explained to others.<br />He does seem to have a view that there are a few common themes among the religions (e.g., achieving happiness by losing the separate self in compassionate service to others).	2003-08-24

This is considered the Bible of marketing thought for early stage, technically-oriented products.  It describes the phases of customer thinking, and how you have to appeal to them, including some non-intuitive but dead-on approaches for making the leap to the Early Majority. <br />For some reason, this second edition seems to have been edited poorly though, with grammar erros and such.  Unfortunate for a great work.	2003-07-14

Having studied under Carl Sagan at Cornell and generally being firmly planted in the rational, I think only an approach like that of Wilbur's could get me entertaining some of the concepts I generally consider to be \\"out there.\\"  The reason is that he very inclusively maps a lot of belief sets and areas of science into an inclusive theory, that makes you know he heard your part of it, but points out there's more over in this other area (stage or quadrant or whatever).  By being non-dismissive, he makes a more complete theory.  I find myself applying the thinking in my daily life to things like evolutionary product design, organizational structure, etc.<br />The downside for me was writing style.  I found Wilbur hard to crack, and it took a month or so of time investment in reading several of his books simultaneously for me to start to get it.  Before I got it, I found him complicated and tedious.  After I began to understand the general framework, I started finding him a bit repetitive (more in other works than this shorter one).  I think this could be a challenging read as an intro course, without either some prior Wilbur or a reasonable grounding in a range of other philosophy/psych reading.  I'd recommend either reading Wilbur's History of Everything or maybe \\"The Essential Wilbur\\" with this.  <br />Nevertheless, this book is amazing, as is Wilbur, for his ability to synthesize so much information from so many fields of study into something so elegant.	2003-07-14

Makes complex issues accessible	Paul Krugman distills complex economic issues into easy-to-read and comprehend parts.  If you want to understand some key economics concepts, but don't have much econ training, his writing is for you.  He doesn't \\"dummy down\\" the subject, he just uses regular english without an expectation that you know the jargon, and it makes sense.	1999-04-11
