In his introduction, Jack Schwager, author of \\"Market Wizards\\" and \\"The New Market Wizards\\", proclaims \\"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\\" to be \\"one of the most highly regarded financial books ever written\\" and predicts that the book will still be relevant a century from now. Whatever else may be said for it, this book is certainly one of the most entertaining financial books ever written. \\"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\\" was first published in 1923, after being serialized in the \\"Saturday Evening Post\\". Author Edwin Lef&egrave;vre was a journalist who spent several weeks interviewing the great stock market speculator Jesse Livermore for the book. \\"Reminiscences\\" is a fictionalized account of Livermore's career as a trader, narrated in the first person using the pseudonym Larry Livingstone. I don't know precisely what has been fictionalized, but Livermore's trading philosophy comes through loud and clear.<br /><br />\\"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\\" follows the pseudonymous Livingstone's career from his first trade at the age of 15 in a Boston bucket shop, to his move to New York and Wall Street at the age of 21 where he went broke 3 times in 2 years as he struggled to refine his methods, through making his first million on the crash of 1907, subsequent bankruptcy, his spectacular comeback in 1915, to the great wealth and success he enjoyed at the time this book was written. Livingstone's spectacular ups and downs are exciting, if nerve-wracking, and the evolution of his methods is fascinating. The author takes us through Livingstone's reasoning as he masters the bucket shops in his youth, takes longer to learn how to succeed in Wall Street brokerages, and offers his observations on market manipulation, tip-taking, the \\"unexpectable\\", and marketing stocks for others. Livingstone/Livermore operated in a much less regulated market than we have now, but the lessons he learned and astute observations he made nearly a century ago are remarkably applicable today.<br /><br />Jesse Livermore has been posthumously diagnosed as suffering from bipolar disorder. Diagnoses of mental illness are frequently inaccurate when the individual is sitting right in front of his doctor, so I am skeptical of those made posthumously based only on documents and secondhand accounts. But in reading \\"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\\", it is not difficult to come to the same conclusion. Livermore suffered from bouts of severe depression and mania. He didn't trade when he was depressed, but the results of his mania are gut-wrenching to read. It's evident that he simply couldn't control his behavior during the cotton-buying binge that sent him into bankruptcy in the early 1910s. He recognized that his mind didn't \\"function with equal efficiency at all times\\" and speaks of the agitated and irrational state that occasionally overcame him. His frustration with what he called his \\"human weaknesses\\" is quite affecting. They were not typical weaknesses; he was ill. But I have to admire Livermore for coping the only way he could: blame himself, move on, and come back. Had he not had periods of illness, Jesse Livermore might have been the wealthiest American ever. But the fact that he did adds another dimension to \\"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\\".<br />Jesse Livermore has been posthumously diagnosed as suffering from bipolar disorder.

Customer Service @Amazon.com.	\\"21 Dog Years\\" is a satirical account of life as a Amazon.com employee by self-described slacker Mike Daisey, who was recruited though a staffing company in 1998 to work in Customer Service Tier 1 and left the company in a fit of angst in 2000 in spite of enjoying his position in Business Development. The book's audience might be those seeking workplace comedy or those in search of information about Amazon.com's culture. \\"21 Dog Years\\" originated as a one man show, so it aims to entertain. At the same time, the book is very much in the tradition of gonzo journalism: insightful but inherently subjective and self-interested. If it is information about Amazon.com you seek, it's a little difficult to know where the hyperbole begins and ends. Mike Daisey's perspicacity is obvious from Chapter 1, where he observes the predicament of Gen Xers in the Baby Boomer economy of the 1990s, and he never hesitates to dwell on his own faults -which are many. He was a bad Customer Service Rep. He loved his company, but hated his job. Daisey seemed more competent and content in his Business Development position, but most of the book is about his experiences in Customer Service, probably because discontent is more compelling than comfort.<br /><br />As for whether the book is funny, I think it has more moments of insight than comedy. It is informative only if you are interested in how the company philosophy was felt by low-level employees. The book's most obvious fault is that Mike Daisey is a generally unsympathetic personality. Not so much because he is a liar and a crook, but because he is whiny and self-absorbed. Only his intellect makes \\"21 Dog Years\\" readable. \\"Amazonia\\", written by Amazon.com employee #55 James Marcus, who spent 5 years with the company, is a more informative, literate account. But Marcus seemed to be trying very hard not to offend anyone, leaving readers to glean his opinions between the lines. \\"21 Dog Years\\" suffers from the opposite style: It's all about mouthing off, sometimes to the point of sensationalism. People are either going to love this or hate it, but I'm giving \\"21 Dog Years\\" 3 1/2 stars because I found the book to be very readable and intermittently insightful.outhing off, sometimes to the point of sensationalism.

Tony Juniper was a member of the 1990 expedition to Brazil that located the last Spix Macaw surviving in the wild, In \\"Spix's Macaw: The Race to Save the World's Rarest Bird\\", he tells the story of the species' history, its demise in the late 20th century, and efforts to preserve the Spix through captive breeding. The Spix's Macaw was always a rare bird, found only in the caraiba gallery woodlands of eastern Brazil. Named after Johann Baptist Ritter von Spix, a Bavarian naturalist who happened upon the bird in 1819 during a 4-year expedition to observe and catalog Brazil's fauna, the Spix Macaw was not observed in the wild again until 1903. But by then, captured Spix's Macaws were being exported to zoos and pet owners on several continents.<br /><br />In exploring the scant history of its namesake, \\"Spix's Macaw\\" touches on the history of parrot-keeping and trading as well as the other blue Brazilian parrots: the Hyacinth, Glaucous, and Lear's macaws. The second half of the book addresses the efforts, politics, and progress in preserving the Spix's Macaw with the intention of restoring the species to the wild, including detailed accounts of how we got from having about 25 known living Spix's Macaws worldwide in the late 1980s to having over 60 by the year 2000. If that sounds promising, it is in the sense that it proves the birds can be bred with relative ease. But it's not if you consider the politics and posturing involved, which become obscenely obvious if you read this book.<br /><br />Tony Juniper is a fluid writer who knows a lot about his subject and clearly cares about it, so \\"Spix's Macaw\\" is very readable. Unfortunately, the book's last two chapters are dedicated to demonizing the private owners of Spix's macaws, including those responsible for the breeding successes of the 1990s, and flogging the agenda of restoring the birds to Brazil and to their original habitat. Anyone who thinks that these initiatives are unreasonable or unproductive is apparently selfish, immoral, and actually criminal in the estimation of Tony Juniper. Juniper believes that forcibly removing the birds from their owners and handing them over to the entity that has had the least success in breeding them is the way to save the species. Brazil has had upwards of 35 years to organize breeding and conservation programs and has, instead, vacillated between indifference and incompetence. I wouldn't give Brazil a budgie. The international Recovery Committee didn't do much better, failing to ever produce a studbook and irresponsibly releasing a female Spix who was a known breeder back into her natural habitat -where she promptly died- while there were only 60 Spix's Macaws in existence! Only the death of the last wild Spix prevented them from releasing 4 more birds. Thank god for timely demises.<br /><br />\\"Spix's Macaw\\" contains a lot of interesting information on the efforts to save this bird. Readers can decide for themselves if these efforts and Tony Juniper's agenda are misguided. But I was struck by the indifference to the birds themselves. For Brazil, which insists that all the world's Spix's Macaws -including those born elsewhere- are its \\"sovereign property\\", the macaws represent some sort of nationalism. Returning them to \\"the wild\\" is a battle cry for fanatic conservationists, who transform the birds plight into socio-political dogma. Private owners keep the birds for their own reasons. But no party in this book gives any indication of having an iota of respect for the creatures. The birds are eclipsed by every manner of agenda. Increasing the birds' numbers should be the primary goal, but it falls victim to Brazil's sweeping claims and self-righteous accusations. A pipe dream of reintroducing the Spix to its natural environment takes precedence over breeding. No one seems to know if the gallery forests could even support a flock of significant size, and, in any case, that habitat won't be there for long. It would indeed be ironic if a century from now parrot-lovers are thanking the private collectors and black marketeers of the 20th century for saving the Spix's Macaw from the fate that met its extinct cousin, the Glaucous macaw: Habitat Destruction. What the Spix's Macaw needs most is for the humans it depends on to swallow a heavy dose of realism.century from now parrot-lovers are thanking the private collectors and black marketeers of the 20th century for saving the Spix's Macaw from the fate that met its extinct cousin, the Glaucous macaw: Habitat Destruction.

White, his former student, in the 1950s, is still the most helpful guide to writing English prose in the smallest package. The book includes sections on: Rules of Usage, Principals of Composition, Matters of Form, Words and Expressions Commonly Misused, and a section entitled \\"An Approach to Style\\" in which Mr. White offers some excellent advice on style in the broader sense of writing that reflects the author's personality or tastes. There is also a glossary of grammar and usage terms in the back of the book. The section on English usage is useful but not comprehensive. And I believe a couple of the rules are outdated, even though this 4th edition was published in the year 2000. The rest of the book is truly dedicated to \\"the elements of style\\", meaning a writing style's most essential considerations. The authors explain, with good humor and language that is easy to understand, the \\"dos and don'ts\\" for writing clear and effective prose. These rules and recommendations can probably be summarized by saying, \\"Be direct and concise.\\" But \\"The Elements of Style\\" tells the reader how to accomplish this goal. This book doesn't address how to structure a paragraph or organize an essay, so writers seeking advice on these topics will need some additional text. \\"The Elements of Style\\" is dedicated to constructing sentences in the most effective style. Middle school, high school,  and college students -and anyone who would like to refresh his or her writing skills- will find \\"The Elements of Style\\" helpful, especially in writing academic prose. Messrs. Strunk and White have extracted the most essential points of writing good English, recognized the most common mistakes, and put them into this small, inexpensive and easily absorbed little book.	2005-08-09

First published in 1981, \\"The Dark Side of the Screen\\" was among the first books in English on the subject of film noir. Author Foster Hirsch revisits that time before film noir was a fashionable subject in his introduction to this 2001 edition. More than 2 decades after its publication, \\"The Dark Side of the Screen\\" is still a solid introduction to film noir history, although it lacks discussion of the neo-noir films that have been made since its publication and has not been influenced by more recent theories. If you are new to classic film noir, this book is not a bad place to start. It is very readable, discusses or mentions over 100 films, and the large format (8.5\\"x11\\") allows for over 180 black-and-white photographs. \\"The Dark Side of the Screen\\" contains basic information on the film noir movement that you are likely to find in any good introductory text, so it's not intended for those already well-versed in the subject.<br /><br />In eight chapters, Hirsch follows the film noir movement through its classic period, 1941 to the late 1950s, until its self-conscious revival in the 1970s. \\"The Dark Side of the Screen\\" starts out with an overview of typical noir themes and summary of the style's evolution, then takes a step back in time to film noir's sources, obvious and alleged, in American hard-boiled crime literature, German Expressionist art, and Italian Neo-Realist cinema. Hirsch summarizes noir's narrative and visual style before discussing key directors, mainly German &eacute;migr&eacute;s and Americans, and many of the important names among film noir actors, with analysis of the typical film noir acting style. The book concludes with a useful, though occasionally forced, attempt to categorize film noir's basic narrative patterns and central figures and a brief discussion of neo-noir.<br /><br />Like all historians and theorists, Foster Hirsch has opinions. His assertion that film noir is a \\"genre\\" and his presumption that its low-key lighting is \\"borrowed directly\\" or \\"clearly indebted\\" to German Expressionism become increasingly controversial as time passes. I mention this so that film noir aficionados know where he's coming from and to caution tyros that many ideas about film noir are controversial, so take everything with a grain of salt until you've formed your own opinions. But there is no reason not to start forming them with \\"The Dark Side of the Screen\\", which provides a nice overview of the classic film noir movement and lots of good film recommendations.\\" or \\"clearly indebted\\" to German Expressionism become increasingly controversial as time passes.

As Harry, Ron, and Hermione's 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry approaches, the magical world is in turmoil. Wizard authorities are engaged in open warfare with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Death Eaters and dementors are wreaking havoc on the magical and Muggle worlds alike. Cornelius Fudge has been replaced as Minister of Magic by the more public relations-savvy Rufus Scrimgeour. And Horace Slughorn, an old acquaintance of Albus Dumbledore's, is to be the new professor at Hogwart's. The school is under heavier than ever security, but students and teachers get on with their activities as normally as possible. Students carry on romances, social intrigues, and the usual stuff while Headmaster Dumbledore tries to impart crucial knowledge to Harry that he will need if he is to fight Lord Voldemort. And Draco Malfoy is little seen, as he has been entrusted with a sinister mission which he carries out in secret.<br /><br />In keeping with tradition, \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" reveals a little more of the mysterious past and of Harry's destiny. This time, the past that is revealed is not Harry's, but Voldemort's. It strikes me that the characters in this book can be divided into three sets, each of which J.K. Rowling develops differently: Voldemort becomes more of a real character than in previous books, as we learn about his beginnings. Albus Dumbledore continues in the vein started in Book 5, where he began to appear vulnerable. But Dumbledore has completely reversed his tendency to keep information from Harry. Now he wants to reveal all that he knows with some urgency.<br /><br />The third set of characters is the students, who have become a character development problem. We see in Harry, Ron, and Hermione -perhaps for the first time- that these books truly are intended for children. The trio of 16-year-olds simply hasn't grown up. It might also be said that the adults' feelings and grudges in Rowling's books don't change, but stagnation is plausible in adults. The problem is most evident in the dialogue, where bright, adventurous young adults are made to speak like 12-year-olds. Maybe this is inevitable in a series of childrens' books which follow young characters over time. And children may not notice the implausibility of the characters' manner. But older readers can't help but notice that behavior that was precocious on 11-year-olds in \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is remedial on 16-year-olds. Harry has become oddly passive, as well, which I can't say is an improvement. It's as if Rowling hasn't figured out how to write mature characters for a young audience.<br /><br />Like its immediate predecessor, \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\", \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is needlessly long and verbose. The book is very readable, but the first two-thirds is burdened by extraneous scenes and descriptions. The last third picks up the pace considerably, but the book should have been much tighter. For all the exposition, this seems more like a segway between Book 5 and the finale than a novel in itself, as very little happens. In spite of problems with editing and character development, \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is fun. And that's a great credit to J.K. Rowling, considering that her formula is getting tired at this point. \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is the weakest in the series so far. It utterly lacks the clever humor and vivid imagery that enchanted children and adults alike in the first 3 books. I wish I could say that was replaced by character development, but it was only replaced by verbiage. Nevertheless, fans will be pleased to learn more about the mysterious Lord Voldemort, and they will be entertained by the story despite its flaws.n adults.

This biography was written in 1975 by Daniel Farson, Bram Stoker's great-nephew, whose grandfather was Bram's younger brother Tom. It has the advantage of being privy to family gossip and anecdotes, but doesn't demonstrate the scholarship of the more recent \\"Bram Stoker: A Biography of the Author of Dracula\\" by Barbara Belford. In fact, \\"The Man Who Wrote Dracula\\" is given to careless use of words and unsubstantiated innuendo, but includes some details of Bram Stoker's professional life not found in Belford's book.<br /><br />\\"The Man Who Wrote Dracula\\" is poorly organized into 3 parts. Part One gets off to an inauspicious start by suggesting, on the first page, that Bram Stoker's debilitating childhood illness may have been psychological, which is low on the list of possibilities. It covers Stoker's time in Ireland, from his birth to his civil service career and moonlighting as a drama critic. Then it moves to London as Stoker takes the job that would define his life: acting manager of the Lyceum Theatre and assistant to the actor Henry Irving. It continues through the best years of his life at the Lyceum. Farson only gets around to talking about Stoker's writing in the last chapter, even though he had been a published author for years at that point.<br /><br />Part Two concerns the origins and reception of \\"Dracula\\". There are chapters on vampire folklore, modern vampire superstitions, explanations of vampire beliefs, literary antecedents, the 15th century Wallachian prince from whom the novel took its name  -Vlad \\"Dracula\\" Tepes, and Farson analyzes some of the more far-fetched interpretations of \\"Dracula\\". I have to commend Farson for stating, in reference to Vlad Tepes, that \\"Stoker seized on the name of Dracula, together with a vague impression of the background, and that was all\\". It was around the time this book was published that the theory that Count Dracula was based on the historical Vlad Tepes was becoming popular.<br /><br />Part Three returns to Stoker's life, starting in 1895, when Farson claims that Stoker started writing Dracula. Stoker actually began the novel 5 years earlier, but his working notes had not been discovered until after this book was published. We follow Stoker through difficult days at the Lyceum, fraught with financial difficulties, to life after Henry Irving, to Bram Stoker's death. Farson includes more details and commentary about Stoker's advocacy of censorship of the arts than I have read elsewhere, which is interesting. His speculation -which Farson states as fact- about the cause of Stoker's death has been the cause of much debate. Farson claims that Stoker died of syphilis, because his death certificate lists \\"locomotor ataxia\\" among the causes of death. Locomotor ataxia is, indeed, syphilitic spinal sclerosis, but Stoker had several strokes in the months before his death, whose symptoms could easily have been confused with those of locomotor ataxia by an imperceptive doctor.<br /><br />\\"The Man Who Wrote Dracula\\" seems carelessly written. Although it contains some interesting anecdotes, it doesn't usually mention their source. Still, \\"Dracula\\" scholars will want to read this biography and glean what they can. But it would make a confusing and underinformed introduction to Bram Stoker's life. Read Barbara Belford's 1996 biography first.was all\\".

In \\"Dashiell Hammett: A Daughter Remembers\\", Jo Hammett has compiled her own impressions and memories of her father, in part to dispute some of his more careless biographers. I didn't expect much beyond sentimental and possibly superficial recollections of a daughter who saw her father only occasionally when I began reading this book. I must admit I underestimated the author's forthrightness. Jo Hammett obviously loved and admired her parents, but she doesn't hesitate to speak of their faults. Jo was a child in her father's productive writing years, but in his later years she was his frequent correspondent and link to his family. This book starts with a little history of the Hammett, Dashiell, and Dolan (her mother's) families and general history of her parents' romance and her father's life before he settled down to family life in San Francisco. Jo Hammett goes on to speak of Dashiell's relationship with his usually estranged family, Lillian Hellman, his time in the Army, in prison, his drinking, poor health, and the time she spent with him the year before his death. I felt that I got a clearer picture of Dashiell Hammett's personality from this book than from reading some of his biographies. It is from one person's perspective, but the book is insightful as far as it goes. The text and about 130 photographs and illustrations, mostly from family albums, are printed on slick white paper that displays them well. Fans and scholars of Dashiell Hammett will appreciate Jo Hammett's observations and fond memories in \\"A Daughter Remembers\\".	2005-06-20

Johnson has avoided extrapolating emotions and motivations behind Hammett's actions, but instead relied on his letters for insight, sometimes printing the letters in between her prose. The book follows Samuel Dashiell Hammett from his birth in Maryland in 1894 to his death in 1961. Since Hammett stopped writing books and stories in 1934, two thirds of this biography concerns his post-literary life. Johnson discusses the work for Pinkerton National Detective Agency that informed Hammett's writing, but not in much detail. His frequently failing health, alcoholism, and relationships with family and playwright Lillian Hellman are treated in depth, as are his trial, 6 months incarceration for refusing to say if he was a bail-fund trustee for the Civil Rights Congress, and testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in the 1950s.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there seems to be a great deal of information about Hammett's flamboyant lifestyle and politics after he stopped writing and comparatively little while he was a working stiff and struggling writer. He was seen and known by everyone in middle age, but his more productive years were either less documented or altogether simpler. Diane Johnson has peppered her prose with seldom published pieces of Hammett's writing: articles, advertising copy, book reviews, poetry, and many letters, which is informative, in itself, but doesn't affect the writing style favorably.

One event was the 1893 World's Fair -or the World's Columbian Exposition in honor of the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America. The Fair was the product of 3 years of work by the nation's leading architects, engineers, artists, and thousands of workmen under the guidance of Chicago architect Daniel Burnham, the Fair's tireless Director of Works. Burnham would set the aesthetic tone, recruit the artists, and build his dream city to stand for 6 months, May-October 1893, during which time visitors in record-breaking numbers would be introduced to products and technologies, like large-scale use of alternating electric current, that would soon transform the daily lives of millions.<br /><br />At the same time, not far from the Fair's Jackson Park site, a physician and con artist, Herman Webster Mudgett, had taken the name of Henry Howard Holmes, made a success of his pharmacy business, and had a mind to make a macabre profit from the upcoming Fair. Holmes was constructing a city block, nicknamed \\"The Castle\\" by neighbors, which was to house retail stores, apartments, offices, and a hotel for travelers who had come to Chicago for the Fair. But this dark, labyrinthine, building held as many secrets as its creator. Among its curious features were a soundproof airtight vault with gas jets controlled from Holmes'  personal rooms, a crematorium, a basement lime pit, and dissection facilities. H.H. Holmes would become America's first documented serial killer, whose appetite for power and the adoration of young women would only be undone by his lust for money, but not before he apparently murdered dozens of people.<br /><br />Author Erik Larson alternates Daniel Burnham's struggle to create a World's Fair to rival Paris' 1889 Exposition, stories of the Fair's key personalities, such as landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead, engineer George Washington Gale Ferris, Chief of the Midway and future Congressman Sol Bloom, painter and Director of Functions Francis Millet, with the simultaneous, sinister machinations of H.H. Holmes. Generally, the subjects alternate, one chapter after the other, but author Larson has worked another parallel story into the book, although sporadically: That of Irish immigrant Patrick Prendergast, the assassin of Chicago Mayor Carter Henry Harrison.<br /><br />I found Holmes' story more compelling than that of the Fair, but the Fair chapters contain far more information, and they effectively convey the sense of anticipation and stress that nagged Burnham and his artists, as they were pressed to build a city in not nearly enough time, with too few materials, through harsh weather conditions, while one of the nation's greatest economic depressions loomed. The truth is that there is limited reliable information about Holmes and his misdeeds. For dramatic and narrative purposes, Larson describes a couple of murders in more detail than could really be known. And he occasionally interjects unfounded speculation about Holme's childhood. Apart from these minor points, I have to commend Larson for sticking to the facts of Holmes' case and avoiding the fabrications and exaggerations that I've seen elsewhere. But this does make Holmes' story less sensational than it could be and, indeed, was at the time. But the book's most glaring shortcoming is its lack of illustrations. \\"The Devil in the White City\\" would have greatly benefitted from an insert with photos of the World's Fair, the individuals involved, and of Holmes' \\"Castle\\".s of the Fair's key personalities, such as landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead, engineer George Washington Gale Ferris, Chief of the Midway and future Congressman Sol Bloom, painter and Director of Functions Francis Millet, with the simultaneous, sinister machinations of H.H.

For fans and scholars of Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" who don't know what to make of the abundance of contradictory and possibly fanciful information about Stoker and his novel that is floating around, Elizabeth Miller offers a solution. \\"Dracula: Sense and Nonsense\\" attempts to address, piece by piece, the pervasive unreliable information about \\"Dracula\\" that has been passing as fact for the past few decades.<br /><br />Miller doesn't challenge interpretations of the novel in this book, only outright errors and unsubstantiated propositions. Each piece of \\"information\\" that Miller has identified as a misconception is quoted, then followed by an explanation of the error and the facts of the matter, when they are verifiable. Much of the misinformation about \\"Dracula\\"'s origins can be cleared up by referring to Stoker's Working Notes for the novel, housed  in the Rosenbach Museum & Library's collection in Philadelphia. Miller makes extensive use of the Notes and has also done impressive detective work tracking down sources of misconceptions. \\"Sense and Nonsense\\" addresses misinformation and unsupported supposition from a variety of scholarly and popular books on \\"Dracula\\", as well as the occasional documentary film.<br /><br />\\"Dracula: Sense and Nonsense\\" is organized into 6 chapters, each of which addresses a different topic of misinformation: \\"The Sources for Dracula\\", \\"Stoker and the Writing of Dracula\\", \\"The Novel\\", \\"The Geography of Dracula\\", and \\"Vlad the Impaler\\". Miller feels a particular need to dispel the popular idea that Stoker's Count Dracula character was based on the 15th century Wallachian Prince Vlad \\"Dracula\\" Tepes. The last chapter is a \\"Source Alert\\", in which Miller critiques a number of works of \\"Dracula\\" scholarship -annotated editions, bibliographies, biographies, and miscellaneous studies- in terms of their accuracy and value to researchers.<br /><br />\\"Dracula: Sense and Nonsense\\" is readable, interesting, and probably essential to obsessed \\"Dracula\\" fans. It's great to get the facts and to know their sources, which Miller documents meticulously. You may agree or disagree with some of the suppositions that have been made about the novel, but at least now you will know where they came from.

Barbara Belford's \\"Bram Stoker: A Biography of the Author of Dracula\\" is considered to be the most scholarly and thorough of the 3 Bram Stoker biographies that have been published. But Mr. Stoker was a reticent person about whose personal life, opinions, and character there is precious little known. Whether out of humility or caution, he usually took care not to reveal himself. So what we know of Stoker comes primarily from his public life, which was thankfully shared with several grander, more loquacious personalities. Perhaps due to the scarcity of information about her subject, Barbara Belford gives Stoker's friends, colleagues, and the London theater community a lot of attention, especially Henry Irving, the great actor whose fame was dwarfed only by his ego, and whom Bram Stoker dedicated 27 years of his life to serving. Indeed, this biography of Stoker would serve well as a history of Irving's famous Lyceum Theatre for the decades that Stoker served as its acting manager.<br /><br />The  book starts by describing Stoker's childhood in Dublin, the third child born to a middle class Anglo-Irish family in 1847 during the potato famine, and his apparent debilitation until the age of 7. He grew up to be a civil servant like his father, and pursued personal interests as an unpaid drama critic for the \\"Evening Mail\\", through which Stoker met Henry Irving. After marrying the lovely Florence Balcombe, whom Oscar Wilde also courted, the Stokers moved to London where  Bram's efficient management would help make the 1500-seat Lyceum Theatre fashionable and profitable. Since the Lyceum dominated Stoker's life, it dominates his biography, but Belford also discusses his trips to America on tour with the Lyceum company, his effusive admiration for Walt Whitman and Abraham Lincoln, and his novels and stories.<br /><br />The upshot of \\"Bram Stoker: A Biography of the Man Who Wrote Dracula\\" is that Bram Stoker was a modest, hardworking man, exceedingly courteous even by Victorian standards, whose tireless work for Henry Irving was acknowledged by many but unappreciated and unrewarded by Irving himself. Stoker's genial but reserved manner harbored passionate, worshipful emotions toward his heroes, invariably men of power with larger-than-life personalities. Belford draws an occasional parallel between persons in Bram Stoker's own life and characters in \\"Dracula\\". Most notably, she sees a \\"sinister caricature\\" of Henry Irving in the vampire Count. Actress Ellen Terry seems to be reflected in Mina, and Stoker's wife Florence may have lent some of her character to Lucy. None of this is a stretch as long as one recognizes that \\"Dracula\\"'s characters don't have a single source, but many.<br /><br />This biography includes a lot of good information for fans of Bram Stoker's work, but a couple of stylistic problems nagged at me. One is Belford's confusing tendency to refer to people by first or last name only, at the beginning of a chapter, instead of starting off with a full name. Another is the repeated use of the phrase \\"Unholy Trinity\\" to describe the business partnership between Henry Irving, Bram Stoker, and stage manager H.J. Loveday, which I found melodramatic. But Belford's book succeeds in creating a picture of Bram Stoker's personality without reading too much into his actions or words.torian standards, whose tireless work for Henry Irving was acknowledged by many but unappreciated and unrewarded by Irving himself.

Literary agent Neil Olson deftly moves to the other side of the desk with his debut novel \\"The Icon\\", a story of obsession, faith, and art that took hold of men in their youth and threatens to invade their families a lifetime later. A Byzantine Icon, The Holy Mother of Katamari, hidden in the Greek village of Epirios, was thought lost to the flames when the retreating German Army burned the village behind them in 1944. But the Icon was smuggled out under circumstances not clearly understood even to those who participated. It eventually became the most prized possession of an enigmatic New York collector named Kessler. When Kessler dies, his granddaughter Ana is left to dispose of his estate, placing the Icon back onto the market, within the reach of men who coveted it since it touched their lives in Greece so long ago. Fotis Dragoumis and Andreas Spyridis are old men now, inextricably linked since their fighting days in Greece, locked in combat by the Icon that they stole. Fotis asks his godson, Andreas' grandson Matthew, who is a specialist in Byzantine art, to advise Ana Kessler of her options in selling the Icon. Matthew quickly finds himself caught between two manipulative men fighting over something long past and his attraction for Ana. And the game for possession of the Holy Mother begins.<br /><br />\\"The Icon\\" takes place primarily in modern New York City, but periodically returns to Greece of 1944, so that the events of the past are revealed as those of the present unfold. The novel takes a long time to divulge its secrets, but it keeps the reader curious. To a large extent, we experience the story as Matthew does. He is an ordinary man who inhabits our world, tries to resist the passions and politics of the past, and learns how his own history is intertwined with the Icon as he goes along. Although we are in a sense Matthew, the reader will likely prefer the sordid past and haunted lives of the old men to a future free from obsession. \\"The Icon\\" features the most vital bunch of octogenarians I have ever heard of. The Icon's pursuers are mostly in their late 80s, physically frail, but possessed of the emotional energy and intensity of young men. I don't know how realistic that is, but characters who have both shadowy pasts and single-minded ambitions make for intriguing fiction. These men, driven by lifelong obsession, become increasingly focused as they accelerate toward death.<br /><br />\\"The Icon\\" weaves a seductive tale across several generations and continents, but its themes are as ambiguous as the Icon's power. That might not be a bad thing. The novel successfully conveys the spiritual effect of the Icon on those who seek to possess it, making its lure almost comprehensible. It is interesting that the Icon is not coveted for its beauty or craftsmanship, but for the power of absolution that some people see in it. The characters are not religious in the conventional sense, but they have an all-consuming faith. Faith in what is not clear. Faith in the Icon. Or perhaps in Art. Art that reflects the souls of its audience back at them, but the reflection is transformed, for better or worse, into the facet of their character that their actions have always deceived. Not surprisingly, some want to possess this power, and some want to destroy it. \\"The Icon\\" is a strong debut from author Neil Olson. It's literate, engaging, and, thankfully, mostly devoid of the mundane emotional quandaries that too often substitute for story. Fans of thrillers will enjoy \\"The Icon\\", and admirers of Byzantine art may find it interesting as well.the most vital bunch of octogenarians I have ever heard of.

The book focuses primarily on urban bachelor lifestyles and institutions 1880-1930, the peak years of bachelor subculture in the United States. Most bachelors did, in fact, eventually marry. The bachelor subculture emerged due to men marrying at more advanced age than they previously had, prolonging the time that men spent as unmarried adults.<br /><br />Author Howard Chudacoff introduces his subject with an overview of bachelorhood in colonial and early America and the roots of its negative connotations before moving on to the emergence of sporting-male culture and working class, middle class, and patrician bachelorhood in the 19th century. Included are discussions of why there were so many bachelors; how the social life of singles became an end in itself; how and where bachelors lived; the saloons, pool halls, caf&eacute;s, dance halls and like institutions where these men spent their spare time; bachelors' relationships with women; and an analysis of the popular men's weekly \\"The National Police Gazette\\". The book's last two chapters address American male culture in general: how it changed in the 19th century due to increased urbanization and industrialization, the decline of bachelorhood 1940-1960, and its reemergence in the 1960s.<br /><br />Howard Chudacoff has written an admirable survey of the emergence, prominence, and consequences of bachelor subculture in America. \\"The Age of the Bachelor\\" does contain statistics, so the writing is dense in some places, but it is generally very readable. There is a smattering of period photographs and illustrations throughout. This is a welcome study of an interesting and significant aspect of American social history that has previously been neglected.	2005-05-10

In \\"Hollywood Gothic\\" David Skal tells the story of \\"Dracula\\" that came after the classic of gothic horror was published in 1897. It's a fascinating, fact-filled tale of colorful personalities, legal battles, Hollywood politics, and a culture still captivated by the King of Literary Vampires. The book's seven chapters begin with author Bram Stoker, end with the Count's recent incarnations on stage and screen, and include the most insightful analysis of \\"Dracula\\"'s origins that I have read in the course of my minor obsession with the novel.<br /><br />Chapter 1 explores \\"Dracula\\"'s literary and theatrical predecessors before moving on to discussion of the intellectual and sexual climate into which the book was published in 1897, the life and elusive character of its author Bram Stoker, and how the novel was received in its own day. David Skal does an impressive job of pulling together the relevant details, from diverse perspectives, of the novel's birth.<br /><br />Chapter 2 details the legal battle waged by the Bram Stoker's widow, Mrs. Florence Stoker, to suppress the first cinematic adaptation of her husband's novel, 1922's \\"Nosferatu\\", the unauthorized German production directed by F.W. Murnau, now recognized as a masterpiece of silent cinema. Chapter 3 sees Mrs, Stoker finally authorize an adaptation to British dramatist Hamilton Deane, whose wordy, plodding \\"Dracula\\" play nevertheless achieved great financial success, attracting the attention of American theatrical producer Horace Liveright. Liveright enlisted journalist John Balderston to rewrite the play for Broadway and make it a smash hit on this side of the Atlantic.<br /><br />Chapter 4 moves to Hollywood for the protracted negotiations over \\"Dracula\\"'s film rights. \\"Dracula\\"'s path through the early 20th century was mined with legal battles, and it is a credit to author David Skal that he is able to make interminable and constantly mutating negotiations into absorbing drama. Chapter 5 follows the winding road to the production of the first Hollywood \\"Dracula\\", the 1931 film starring Bela Lugosi, which, although made cheaply and lazily, was the first horror talkie and a financial life preserver for Universal Studios. Happily, Skal has dedicated Chapter 6 to the superior Spanish language version of \\"Dracula\\" that was filmed simultaneously, on the same sets, as the English version of the 1931 film, but with a different producer, director, cinematographer, and cast.<br /><br />Chapter 7 tells us what became of the principle person's associated with the two 1931 films.

The book earned Alton appreciation among students of cinematography and the ire of those already working in the field. Students welcomed a how-to book by one of Hollywood's masters. Cinematographers found Alton lessons arrogant and too narrow, as the book advocates Alton's signature, somewhat controversial, style of using few lights. In any case, John Alton is one of the most studied cinematographers in Hollywood history, best known for his low key lighting in film noirs such as \\"T-Men\\" and \\"The Big Combo\\". And \\"Painting with Light\\" provides insight into why and how Alton chose the style he did.<br /><br />An Introduction by film critic and documentarian Todd M. McCarthy provides a biography of John Alton and a filmography. John Alton starts out by saying that his techniques may be applied to still photography, and there are a couple of chapters toward the end of the book dedicated primarily to still photography, so photographers take note. The equipment that Alton describes is outdated, of course, but the reasoning and techniques may still apply, especially to those interested in low key lighting. The book starts out by introducing the cinematographer's equipment and describing basic lighting set-ups. Film noir fans may be particularly interested in Chapter 3, \\"Mystery Lighting\\". Alton found \\"the most beautiful photography is in a low key, with rich blacks\\", and he talks about creating it here. Chapter 4, \\"Special Illumination\\", explores some situations also common to film noir, such as streets, rain, fog, and moonlight. Chapter 5, \\"The Hollywood Close-up\\", might be applied to portrait photography as well as movies. Other topics include \\"Outdoor Photography\\", photographing snow, a just-for-fun article on shipboard photography that seems intended for vacationers, discussion of the beautifying power of light and the brain as \\"human television system\\".<br /><br />\\"Painting with Light\\" makes it clear that John Alton was an opinionated, ambitious man who saw the world around him expressed in light, always noting its direction, intensity, and effect. He made a career of \\"capturing bits of light at rest on things of beauty\\", and this record of his theories and techniques is an interesting read.the brain as \\"human television system\\". <br /> <br />\\"Painting with Light\\" makes it clear that John Alton was an opinionated, ambitious man who saw the world around him expressed in light, always noting its direction, intensity, and effect.

At the time, \\"Dracula\\" didn't aspire to be anything more than a Victorian potboiler, but the novel found such far-reaching appeal that it has never gone out of print in over 100 years. Author Leonard Wolf also produced the excellent annotated edition of the novel \\"The Essential Dracula\\" and has long been one of \\"Dracula\\"'s most dedicated scholars.<br /><br />Wolf introduces \\"A Connoisseur's Guide\\" by telling us how he came to be interested in the Dracula Matter, as he calls it, while teaching at San Francisco State University in the late 1960s. This bit of personal information may seem superfluous, but  those readers who have followed Wolf's work on \\"Dracula\\" will find their curiosity finally satisfied. And the circumstances that led to Wolf's -and indeed anyone's- first book on the Dracula Matter, \\"A Dream of Dracula\\", published in 1972, reveal an interesting climate on American college campuses that led to academia's acceptance of \\"Dracula\\" as a work worthy of study.<br /><br />\\"Dracula: A Connoisseur's Guide\\" then takes us through the \\"Dracula\\" phenomenon, from folklore to fiction to film. Wolf dedicates a chapter to each of these subjects: vampire folklore in various cultures, the symbolism and realities of blood, vampire bats, the 15th century Wallachian Prince Vlad Tepes from whom \\"Dracula\\" takes its name, gothic literature, literary precursors to \\"Dracula\\", the life of Bram Stoker, an analysis of the novel in four parts, 20th century vampire fiction, and vampire films from 1922 to 1992. Through these subjects, Wolf discusses \\"Dracula\\"'s descendants and the basis for its persistent appeal, as well as the novel itself.<br /><br />\\"The Connoisseur's Guide\\" incorporates some elements of Leonard Wolf's out-of-print Dracula books. It is a more evolved and scholarly version of 1972's \\"A Dream of Dracula\\", although it lacks many of that book's personal meditations. \\"A Dream of Dracula\\" is quoted several times in \\"The Connoisseur's Guide\\", and most readers won't need a copy of the older book in addition to this one. A couple features of Wolf's first annotated edition, \\"The Annotated Dracula\\", published in 1975, have also made their way here: Wolf's 7-month calendar that plots the action of the novel is reprinted in the back of the book, and the wonderful drawings by S&auml;tty introduce each chapter.

This is a nice edition of the \\"Dracula\\" play that entertained audiences in the 1920s before being transformed into a classic film in 1931. The book contains two plays, in fact: The 1924 version adapted from Bram Stoker's novel by British actor/manager Hamilton Deane and the later 1927 American version adapted by John Balderston.  The plays are illustrated with black-and-white photographs of performances from the 1920s to 1970s, the people involved in the productions, promotional posters, and miscellaneous items related to the plays. Interesting information about the plays, including quotations from old press notices, are found in the margins. David Skal, the book's editor and author of \\"Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of Dracula from Novel to Stage to Screen\\", has written an informative introduction outlining how \\"Dracula\\", the play, came to be written and found enormous popularity in Great Britain and the United States.<br /><br />Touring actor and manager of a theatrical company, Hamilton Deane was the first person licensed by Bram Stoker's widow to write an adaptation of her husband's popular novel -for a paltry percentage of the profit. First performed in 1924, Deane's play found popular success in the provinces before traveling to London. Deane took the role of Professor Van Helsing himself, and Raymond Huntley was the stage's first Count Dracula. This is a three-act play whose dialogue is unnaturally verbose and repetitive. As every adaptation is compelled to mess with the characters, the Texan Quincy Morris has been transformed into a woman. No one could call it good, and no critic did. But Deane's \\"Dracula\\" found wild success with audiences.<br /><br />American producer Horace Liveright commissioned journalist John Balderston to rewrite the play for Broadway in 1927. Raymond Huntley reprised his role as the Count in America, and Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi took on the role as well, although his limited facility with English compelled Lugosi to learn his lines phonetically. The 1931 Universal film of \\"Dracula\\" was adapted from Balderston's play and starred Lugosi. John Balderston would find more success in Hollywood as a screenwriter, including an Academy Award nomination for 1944's \\"Gaslight\\". John Balderston's play is longer, more polished, and generally more effective than Hamilton Deane's. The character change in this version has Lucy and Mina exchange roles. The play received mixed reviews, but audience's loved it. After the 1931 film made him a star, Bela Lugosi retuned to the role on stage. The Balderston/Deane play had a very successful revival as late as the 1970s -resulting in another film- which featured sets designed by Edward Gorey and Frank Langella in the role of Count Dracula.ly.

Author Phillip Hills was a founding member of the Scotch Malt Whisky Society and writes extensively on Scotch, so the examples and tasting recommendations in this book are for Scotch whisky, although the principles of taste and production apply to all whiskies. \\"Appreciating Whisky\\" has two parts: The first 8 chapters provide knowledge necessary to make informed decisions about whiskies, specifically what it tastes like and why. The last 2 chapters explain how to taste whisky and describe some distilleries and their products for your consideration. Phillip Hills' prose is precise and witty throughout.<br /><br />The book starts out with a lesson in the physiology of taste and goes on to describe the 15 flavors that you should be able to recognize in whisky and where they come from. Then we get a lesson in organic chemistry, as Hills explains the chemistry of whisky production, maturation, and the flavors discussed in the previous chapter. The properties, history, and origins of whisky's five materials -barley, water, yeast, peat, and wood- are described. The details of the five processes involved in whisky production -malting, mashing, brewing, distilling, maturing- are explained. Hills addresses the histories and characteristics of grain and blended whiskies as well as malts. And, finally, he explores how the social context -Scottish culture, corporate culture, and the drinker's culture- has influenced the taste, quality, and our perceptions of Scotch whisky, from its 15th century origins to the present.<br /><br />Advice relevant to choosing and drinking whiskies is found in those chapters that address the question of why whisky tastes as it does. But the chapter on \\"Tasting Whisky\\" is a practical guide to whisky tasting that gets into the nitty gritty of what items you will need and what to do with them. The book's last chapter, \\"Appreciations\\", talks about 6 Scotch malt distilleries and their whiskies, as well as a grain whisky distillery, a blender, and some private bottlers. I think anyone who loves whisky but is not an expert on the subject will find \\"Appreciating Whisky\\" invaluable.hat items you will need and what to do with them.

National Geographic's field guide to bird photography is a short, basic handbook for photographing birds in the wild and in your back yard. The advice by Rulon Simmons is  simple and straightforward. Tips are provided by Bates Littlehales, who took most of the approximately 100 color photographs that illustrate the book. The techniques discussed range from simple to advanced, but most are not described in great detail. The guide is best suited to photographers with at least intermediate-level experience, since it requires a 35mm or digital SLR with interchangeable lenses and doesn't provide photographic instruction on metering, exposure, or how to operate equipment.<br /><br />The Field Guide starts off by explaining what equipment you will need, with emphasis on long lenses, although the advice on film is deficient. There is advice for luring and photographing various species of birds at bird feeders, approaching birds in the wild, photographing birds at their nests with and without a blind, photographing birds in flight, and the challenges and opportunities presented by diverse weather conditions. The final chapter lists the author's favorite places to photograph birds in the U.S., 34 locations in 15 states, with a brief description of each birding spot. There is a sort of appendix of \\"Useful Information\\" in the back of the book, which includes recommended methods of getting close to birds, listed alphabetically by species, recommended feed and type of feeder by species, lists of essential and optional equipment, web sites, magazines, and books about birds and photography, and an index.	2005-04-14
US	44189182	RTMOHK4ISPYZ2	0520212940	247479570	More than Night: Film Noir in Its Contexts	Books	4	54	54	N	N	Scholarly Analysis of Film Noir as an Idea, not a Category.	In his Introduction, author James Naremore proposes an alternative title for his book: \\"Seven Ways of Looking at Film Noir\\". That's an accurate description of this book's contents, as each chapter explores a different angle on film noir. But to leave it at that would be misleading. \\"More Than Night\\" is a scholarly analysis of \\"film noir\\" as an idea formed ex post facto that continues to resonate through contemporary media. In other words, it is less about a particular group of films than it is about a \\"discourse\\", to use Mr. Naremore's word. Some chapters do contain discussions of particular films, themes, and styles. Naremore takes the view that films that are considered noir do not really have traits in common, so cannot be categorized in terms of style or genre-style hybrid as most film theorists do. One consequence of this approach is that Naremore considers more films to be noir than most people would. Whether one agrees with the author's premise or not, the breadth of scholarship in \\"More Than Night\\" is impressive, and even longtime noir aficionados are likely to learn something.<br /><br />Chapter 1 gives us an account of \\"The History of an Idea\\", starting with a history of the intellectual and cinematic climate in France from which the idea of film noir emerged in the mid-1940s. How the new crop of American crime films were interpreted by surrealist and existentialist schools of thought. This chapter continues through Paul Schrader's 1972 essay, \\"Notes on Film Noir\\". Notice that Naremore considers the \\"First Age of Film Noir\\"  to be 1946-1959, as the idea was born in 1946, although many noir films were made before then.<br /><br />Chapter 2, \\"Modernism and Blood Melodrama\\", explains that the hard-boiled school of literature was an outgrowth of modernism, which combined with what Graham Greene called \\"blood melodrama\\" films to create film noir. Includes 3 detailed case studies: the writings of Dashiell Hammett, Graham Greene, and an analysis of Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder's adaptation of James M. Cain's \\"Double Indemnity\\".<br /><br />Chapter 3, \\"From Dark Films to Black Lists\\", talks about the impact of the Production Code and challenges the idea that film noirs are basically apolitical by discussing some social-problem noirs and demonstrating that some artists tried to inject politics into their films during the black list years. Chapter 4, \\"Low is High\\", addresses the \\"complex relationship between economics, reception, and cultural prestige\\" by providing an interesting detailed study of the distinctions -and lack of distinctions- between A, B, and intermediate films of the 1940s and 1950s. The economics of modern low-budget direct-to-video thrillers is also discussed.<br /><br />Chapter 5, \\"Old Is New\\", makes that point that classic film noir is actually stylistically rather heterogeneous. It discusses the style of John Alton, the low-key lighting of \\"Out of the Past\\", and the appeal of black-and-white photography. The nostalgic style of \\"Chinatown\\" and the new approaches of  \\"The Long Goodbye\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\" are analyzed, as noir style made the transition from black-and-white to color.<br /><br />Chapter 6, \\"The Other Side of the Street\\", starts off by discussing film noir's representations of women and homosexuals and moves on to explorations of racial and ethnic themes. There are sections on Asia -images of Asian characters and Asian cinema, Latin America -to which classic characters fled for freedom, and Africa -black protest novels, hard-boiled fiction, and black characters in crime films. Chapter 7, \\"The Noir Mediascape\\", explores the \\"circulation and transformation of noir motifs\\" through the media: movies, comics, television, literature, in the past and present. This chapter includes the most extensive discussion of neo-noir in the book.<br /><br />There is a great deal of valuable information and provocative opinion in \\"More Than Night\\". I'm giving it 4 stars, because I think the book is disingenuous on one crucial point. Mr. Naremore chooses to view film noir as something undefinable, as an idea, not  a category -as \\"film noir\\", as opposed to film noir. \\"Film noir\\", the idea, the discourse, certainly exists. There is more evidence of that in popular culture than anyone could identify. But sometimes, primarily in chapters 1 and 3, the author takes issue with film theorists who believe that film noir is also a group of films that can and should be identified and described despite the fact that the group has fuzzy borders. The problem with this is that these two schools of thought can't realistically debate, because their purposes are different. The result is that, when Naremore tries to discredit some of the widely held views of film noir, he can only do so by misrepresenting or misapplying them. In any case, \\"More Than Night\\" isn't light reading or an introductory text, but it is a knowledgeable, opinionated, and often insightful book for noir buffs, students, and professors.is disingenuous on one crucial point.

In the 1940s, women's hairstyles evolved to become more practical for professional women, yet they conveyed glamour and sophistication that endures in movies of that period. Styles tended to be shorter in the War years and longer and looser in the late 1940s. \\"1940s Hairstyles\\" is a how-to guide to creating these lovely styles. There are tips and instructions for the original methods of styling the hair, as well as modern alternatives for many techniques. The instructions vary in degree of detail. They give as much detail as women got in the 1940s, as many of these instructions are taken from period publications. But those women were familiar with the basic techniques and accustomed to watching their hairdressers create these styles. Modern women will need to study the basics in Chapter 2 before moving on to the styles.<br /><br />Chapter 1 provides instructions for \\"Basic Haircuts\\". 2 cuts for short hair are described and illustrated, 2 for medium-length hair, and 2 for long hair. You don't need a period haircut to create the styles in the book, but most styles do require a layered cut in order to make curls on the top and sides of your head. I've also noticed that, for someone with very thick hair like myself, there is simply too much hair for these styles if it's not layered.<br /><br />Chapter 2, \\"The Basics\\", is the most important chapter. This is where you learn how to create the basic elements of 1940s hairstyles: pin curls, waves, hair parts, rolls, pompadours, and bangs. Pay particular attention to the section on pin curls. If 1940s hairstyles could be described with one term, it would be: pin curls. Chapter 3, \\"Selecting the Right Hairstyle\\", provides guidance in choosing a style based on the shape of your face and any imperfections you might want to camouflage.<br /><br />Chapter 4 is \\"Basic Styles\\", divided into 2 parts: Casual Gal and Career Gal. There are some photographs of movie stars sporting some of the included styles. The instructions for each style include period illustrations and sometimes period instructions, presumably taken from old magazines. Some styles include diagrams of pin curl sets and some don't. Remember to pay attention to the direction of the curls in the diagram (clockwise or counterclockwise). \\"Casual Gal\\" includes styles for short, medium, and long hair and for women who wear glasses -about 18 styles total. \\"Career Girl\\" presents styles for short and medium-length hair, including those suitable for women who were in the military -about 15 styles total.<br /><br />Chapter 5 is dedicated to \\"Formal and Up-Dos\\". Seven styles are pictured for various lengths of hair. Chapter 6 discusses styles that incorporate \\"Hair Accessories\\", such as braids and braided hair pieces, ribbons and bows, snoods and hairnets, scarves and turbans, and flowers.<br /><br />There is a \\"Problem Solver Q+A\\" section at the end of the book, which includes answers to commonly asked questions and a little troubleshooting. Appendix A is a list of beauty supplies you will need, with descriptions. Appendix B, \\"Where to Find Beauty Supplies\\", gives general advice, not a list of suppliers.

As Alain Silver explains in the book's Introduction, \\"Film Noir Reader 4\\" is different in purpose from the previous Film Noir Readers. It focuses on key films and key themes, rather than attempting to be inclusive or comprehensive. In that spirit, Silver has included a few lists of the most important film noirs according to himself and others in the Introduction. \\"Film Noir Reader 4\\" contains 23 mostly modern essays, many apparently not previously published, presented in two parts. The paper the book is printed on is pure white, instead of the off-white of previous volumes, so the black-and-white stills look better.<br /><br />Part I, \\"Case Studies\\", includes 12 essays on key films. The films discussed are: \\"Double Indemnity\\", \\"Detour\\", \\"The Big Sleep\\", \\"Out of the Past\\", \\"The Unsuspected\\", \\"Gun Crazy\\", \\"D.O.A\\", \\"The Big Night\\", \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\", \\"The Big Heat\\", \\"The Big Combo\\", and \\"Touch of Evil\\". Glenn Erickson's enthusiastic and insightful essay \\"Fate Seeks the Loser: Edgar G. Ulmer's Detour\\" is particularly interesting. The same can be said for Kevin Hagopian's study of \\"The Big Sleep\\" and Stephen B. Armstrong's history of \\"Touch of Evil\\". Both films were radically altered by recuts, with the result of making them nonsensical. These carefully researched essays explain what was changed and why.<br /><br />Part II focuses on \\"Noir Themes\\", although I don't think that most of these can reasonably be called \\"key\\" themes. Eleven essays discuss a variety of themes that can be found or projected upon classic noir films, including psychodrama, images of women, noir antecedents, horror-noir, war noirs, left-wing politics in noir and crime films, hybrid noir-westerns, and noir title sequences. In other words, Part II is a catch-all. \\"Cat People\\", \\"Rancho Notorious\\" (in comparison to \\"The Big Heat\\"), and \\"Double Indemnity\\" are discussed in the most depth.<br /><br />I'm giving \\"Film Noir Reader 4\\" a lower rating than I gave the previous Film Noir Readers, because it is overwhelmed by the sort of absurd ideological readings that I haven't heard this much of since I studied film in college. The reader can't get far without running into dogmatic -and, I might add, eternally ill-defined- terminology like \\"patriarchal capitalism\\" and \\"misogyny\\". For grown persons to legitimize their socio-economic hang-ups by deliberately misrepresenting 60-year-old movies is pitiful. I am reminded of the reason director Fritz Lang left Germany: The Nazi Party liked his films so much that they offered Lang the opportunity to run the German film industry. His films were anti-fascist. Anyway, there are some good, informative, essays in \\"Film Noir Reader 4\\", and it's useful to present different interpretations. But these aren't so different, and I get the impression of scraping the bottom of the barrel.f absurd ideological readings that I haven't heard this much of since I studied film in college.

Most of the interviews were conducted 1975-1977 by Robert Porfirio for his doctoral dissertation while he was an assistant professor at California State University at Fullerton. Alain Silver and James Ursini also contribute interviews, conducted at various dates. In his Introduction, Mr. Porfirio explains his view of classic film noir as a movement in 4 phases, created primarily out of German Expressionism and the American hard-boiled literary tradition. There is a biographical description and a list of \\"films in the noir style\\" at the conclusion of each interview.<br /><br />Part I contains 8 interviews with directors, who talk about their films' intent, themes, style and how they came to be made. The Hollywood Blacklist is another common topic of conversation. Some directors (as well as some other contributors) doubt the existence of a  \\"film noir style\\", while others are amenable to the concept. The directors interviewed are: Andre de Toth, Edward Dmytryk, Samuel Fuller, Fritz Lang, Joseph H. Lewis, Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, and Robert Wise.<br /><br />Part II, \\"Interviews with Other Filmmakers\\", contains 7 interviews with cinematographers James Wong Howe and John F. Seitz, actresses Lizabeth Scott and Claire Trevor, screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring, composer Miklos Rozsa, and producer Dore Schary. This must have been before Ms. Scott became reclusive. It's nice to read her perceptive comments. Part III includes short \\"Commentaries\\" by 3 directors, which were taken from written and spoken interviews but are not in interview format. The directors are: Curtis Bernhardt, Budd Boetticher, and Daniel Fuchs.<br /><br />It's interesting to compare the perceptions of the people who made classic film noir to those of critics and theorists decades after the fact. I think the interviews tend to support my view that film noir came about due to a confluence of various technological, economic, and legal factors. But the fun is in judging for yourself. \\"Film Noir Reader 3\\" is an enjoyable and informative reference for film noir fans and scholars.onfluence of various technological, economic, and legal factors.

The characters' obsession with discovering the \\"truths\\" concealed within drive the story. Obsession lends itself to character study, which is the approach author Matt Bondurant has chosen for \\"The Third Translation\\". Although interspersed with action scenes, \\"The Third Translation\\" is more a study of its main character, Dr. Walter Rothschild, than a thriller. The ancient object in need of decipherment is the Stela of Paser, in the British Museum's Egyptian collection. The Stela is a stone slab from Egypt's 20th Dynasty, around 1150 B.C., covered in hieroglyphs that contain a hymn to the goddess Mut. The Stela instructs its readers that it should be read \\"three times\\": once horizontally, once vertically, and once....well, that is the mystery. It is hypothesized that the \\"third way\\" was to read around the edge. But that is no longer possible, as the edges have been broken.<br /><br />Dr. Walter Rothschild is a man obsessed with \\"the third translation\\" of the Stela of Paser. An American Egyptologist and one of the world's foremost cryptographic translators, Walter has been employed by the British Museum to dedicate his talents to the mysterious Stela . Walter is a single-minded man whose desire to understand ancient Egyptian texts was always greater than his ability to understand the world in which he lives. His eyes open or closed, Walter sees cryptograms and scripts. Now the Stela's grid of pictographs has taken hold in his mind. One evening, shortly before his contract with the British Museum is to end, Walter and his roommate, Mick Wheelhouse, also a translator at the Museum, accompany a young conspiracy-minded friend, Alan Henry, to a bar in SoHo. Badly dressed and middle-aged, Walter finds himself out of place in the younger, pill-popping crowd, but he meets a woman named Erin who seems to be interested in his work. Flattered by Erin's attentions, Walter takes her to the Museum in the middle of the night, asking the security guard to disable the alarms for them. The next day, a priceless parchment, the \\"Song of Amun\\", excavated from the same site as the Stela, is discovered missing from the Museum's collection. Walter is expected to get it back. Immediately. But Alan is nowhere to be found. Walter has no idea who or where Erin is. His estranged daughter has just arrived in London for a visit. And there is a pistol-wielding African man following him around. Walter has less than a week to recover the parchment, save his career and the British Museum's reputation,  and barely a clue as to where or why it was taken.<br /><br />\\"The Third Translation\\" is written in the first person, by Walter, who recalls the events years later. For a man with little social sense, he is a keen observer of people. \\"The Third Translation\\" spends a lot of time describing its characters, most of whose personalities are dominated by obsession of one sort or another. The narrative alternates smoothly between the mystery at hand and recollections of Walter's past. The search for the stolen parchment propels Walter into a younger, hipper subculture than a middle-aged social misfit can easily navigate. I found it interesting that his detachment and general social apathy allow Walter to simply accept the norms of any environment in which he finds himself, so work to his advantage. At one point Walter observes that the English have a taste for the scatological, and it must have rubbed off on him. There is a peculiar preoccupation with people using the toilet at Walter's flat, and sometimes \\"The Third Translation\\" seems to revel in squalor. Walter's hunt for the errant parchment is peppered with action, but it is mostly a means of discovering something within himself. Walter's mind seems limited in its ability to focus on things outside itself, and the book's somewhat unfocused pursuit of the thieves reflects that. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Since comparisons to Dan Brown's novel are inevitable, I will say that \\"The Third Translation\\" doesn't have \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"'s constant sense of forward motion, but Matt Bondurant's characters are considerably better-drawn. \\"The Third Translation\\" kept me interested most of the time, so I give it 3 1/2 stars.way around.

Karen Hollinger discusses the effects of first-person male voiceovers on the images of female characters in classic film noir. Others essays explore films that feature fugitive couples, noir television series, neo-B noirs, and Jeremy G. Butler writes about \\"Miami Vice\\".<br /><br />The date of first publication is clearly stated for all essays in Part I, but I found myself wondering when some of the other essays had been written. Publication information, including dates, are provided for each essay at the end of the book's Acknowledgments. There are some interesting and essential essays in \\"Film Noir Reader\\", and some less so, but the book provides a nice collection of opinions and observations on the style that are great food for thought for noir fans and scholars.<br /><br />FILM NOIR READER 2<br /><br />\\"Film Noir Reader 2\\" is a collection of 24 essays, written 1945-1999, that attempt to define the film noir sensibility and explore particular films and facets of the style in depth. This book shares the same format with the first \\"Film Noir Reader\\": Essays are arranged in 3 parts. Part I contains \\"More Seminal Essays\\" that augment the defining material in \\"Film Noir Reader\\". There are 8 essays, written 1945-1988, including a surprising article written by Lloyd Shearer for \\"The New York Times\\" in 1945. A year before French film critics identified and began to discuss the film noir style, Shearer plainly recognized a distinct trend in Hollywood toward \\"lusty, hard-boiled, gut-and-gore crime stories, all fashioned on a theme with a combination of plausibly motivated murder and studded with high-powered Freudian implication.\\" Pretty neat definition only 4 years into the noir movement. And Shearer goes on to ask \\"why at this time are so many pictures of the same type being made?\\" Funny that his article should be reproduced in a book that is still trying to answer that question 60 years later. Shearer's article is followed by French critic Nino Frank's 1946 essay in which the term \\"noir\\" was first applied to film. For all the talk of film noir having been created in the minds of critics after the fact, it's apparent that these writers comprehended the existence of film noir style as it was being created.<br /><br />Part II is dedicated to \\"Case Studies\\". It includes 8 essays that discuss \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" (1946 & 1981 versions), \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\", \\"The Big Heat\\", \\"The File on Thelma Jordan\\", \\"Pushover\\", the neo-noirs \\"Mississippi Mermaid\\" and \\"Badlands\\", as well as the films of directors Alfred Hitchcock and Samuel Fuller. There is also an essay by Francis M. Nevins on films adapted from the works of Cornell Woolrich and an essay by Robert G. Porfino on jazz music in film noir. Part III, \\"The Evolution of Noir\\", is an eclectic assortment of 8 essays. Topics include: noir science fiction, British film noir, abstract expressionism in film noir, female protagonists in neo-noir, and tabloid/crime photographer WeeGee's (Arthur Fellig) relationship to film noir, including discussion of the 1992 film \\"Public Eye\\" that was inspired by his career. Film professor Philip Gaines provides an outline of his film noir course, with recommended films and suggested reading. I'd like to mention, in response to Linda Brookover's essay on WeeGee, that although WeeGee's talent for self-promotion was equal to his gift for photojournalism, his photographs were not unique. The work of many excellent and tireless crime photographers adorned the pages of daily newspapers in the 1920s-1950s. Some of them can be seen in the \\"New York Noir\\" gallery of the \\"New York Daily News\\" archive at [...] .

Premised on the idea that we now live in a \\"quantitative information age\\", in which a person can hardly get through a day without reaching some conclusion based on numerical data, but that most people are poor quantitative thinkers who routinely make poor decisions because they are unskilled in analyzing numerical data, authors Derrick Niederman and David Boyum offer us \\"What the Numbers Say\\", a guide to spotting the most common kinds of data manipulation and determining what those numbers really mean. I should say that you do not need to know any mathematics beyond a 6th grade level to understand this book or to successfully decipher the numerical data that one encounters in everyday life. \\"What the Numbers Say\\" is engaging, clear, and easy to read. There are interesting examples taken from the stock market, business world, and current events for every subject that is discussed. And the examples don't have a pervasive political bias.<br /><br />\\"What the Numbers Say\\" starts off by explaining \\"The Ten Habits of Highly Effective Quantitative Thinkers\\" and then dedicates each of six chapters to a different type or facet of quantitative data. \\"For Good Measure\\" explains the importance of understanding what unit your numbers are expressing, the problems inherent in distilling an assortment of data into a single number -such as an index, and troubles with rounding numbers. \\"Playing the Percentages\\" explores the traps of adding fractions, dealing with negative returns, percentages of percents, and ordinals, i.e. rankings. \\"Gaining Perspective\\" talks about very big numbers, very small numbers, and very sensitive numbers -especially denominators. \\"Throwing a Curve\\" is about non-linear relationships, including quadratic relationships and exponential relationships (growth and depreciation). \\"Taking Chances\\" discusses the three schools of probability: classical, frequentist, subjectivist and various methods of expressing probability. \\"The Proof is in the Numbers\\" is a chapter about Statistics that addresses the confusion of correlation and cause, sample sizes, data mining, and surveys. In \\"A Peace Offering for the Math Wars\\", the authors offer a critique of the current mathematics curricula and the lack of quantitative thinking instruction in U.S. schools, including their suggestions for remedying some of the problems.<br /><br />In the book's last chapter, the authors get up on their soapbox about mathematical and quantitative education in American schools, so I trust they won't mind if I get up on mine. I wholeheartedly agree with most of what they say, but I find the authors' reaction to American students' performance in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study puzzling. U.S. students are always \\"smack in the middle of the pack\\" in those studies, which leads Mr. Niederman and Mr. Boyum to conclude that American students are bad at math and that American schools are bad at teaching it. I don't know why anyone gets bent out of shape about the TIMSS results. Americans do better than average. There are always some anglophone nations that do worse and some that do better. I think the results for American students are rather good considering that we have a significant population of non-native-English speakers in our schools and a very heterogeneous population -culturally, ethnically, and geographically- in general. In any case, the authors acknowledge that \\"mathematical knowledge and quantitative reasoning are quite different things\\". So why the fuss?<br /><br />Speaking on another subject, the authors lament the elementary school mathematics curricula, which is full of useless stuff. That's a hopeless cause, because it doesn't take 6 years to cover basic mathematics. So most of elementary school education is filler and repetition -in all subjects. Junior high school and high school mathematics could be improved though. Not really, but at least in theory. There is nothing in a \\"pre-algebra\\" class that anyone needs to do algebra; there's nothing in a \\"pre-calculus\\" class that anyone needs to do calculus; and there's nothing in a geometry class that couldn't be memorized in 10 minutes. Ditching those courses would allow school systems to require that all students take a quantitative reasoning course and one year of calculus without placing any more burden on students or budgets. In the meantime, why not design a quantitative reasoning curriculum that could be made available to high school students taking internet or correspondence courses and publishers of homeschooling materials? As for all those students who reach for a calculator when their brain would do just fine... I recommend Isaac Asimov's short story \\"The Feeling of Power\\".ebra; there's nothing in a \\"pre-calculus\\" class that anyone needs to do calculus; and there's nothing in a geometry class that couldn't be memorized in 10 minutes.

US	44189182	R1ISZYIB2F75SJ	0618084908	159238568	Three Vampire Tales: Dracula, Carmilla, and The Vampyre (New Riverside Editions)	Books	5	20	20	N	N	The Great 19th Century Vampires & Their Antecedents.	\\"Three Vampire Tales\\" is a collection of 19th century vampire literature that follows the increasing popularity of vampires in English literature, from Lord Byron's 1812 poem, \\"The Giaour\\", to the culmination of that century's vampire tales in Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel \\"Dracula\\". The three featured stories are: John Polidori's \\"The Vampyre\\", the first vampire short story in English, published in 1819; \\"Carmilla\\" by Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu, published in 1872 as part of Le Fanu's \\"In a Glass Darkly\\" collection; and Bram Stoker's mythic 1897 novel \\"Dracula\\". All three works are included in their entirety.<br /><br />\\"The Vampyre\\" concerns a taciturn, enigmatic vampire called Lord Ruthven, and Aubrey, a young naive aristocrat, who is at first pleased to have Ruthven as a traveling companion. In the course of their adventures on the Continent, Aubrey comes to understand Ruthven's predatory character. But Ruthven requests an oath of secrecy on his deathbed, to which Aubrey agrees, only to find himself in a dire predicament when Ruthven turns up again, very much alive. This is a good story once you acclimate to the somewhat overburdened prose style.<br /><br />Sheridan Le Fanu is the most accomplished stylist of these three authors, and \\"Carmilla\\" has a crisp, delicate style. It shares with \\"Dracula\\" the technique of \\"authenticating\\" the story by making it out to be a first-person documentation of the events in question. A prologue explains that the story was written more than a decade after the events described, by the woman who experienced them in her youth. The story tells of 19-year-old Laura, who lives on an estate in Styria, Austria, with her widowed father and 2 governesses. The family takes in a lovely, but oddly languid, young woman named Carmilla who was shaken up in a nearby carriage accident. Soon after, women in the surrounding countryside begin to die mysteriously, and Laura experiences strange visitations in the night.<br /><br />I won't say much about \\"Dracula\\" here, because I have said so much elsewhere. The novel has never gone out of print since its publication in 1897, and its continuing influence on literature, film, and popular culture is incalculable. \\"Three Vampire Tales\\" is not as limited as the title implies, however. After an informative introduction by editor Anne Williams, the first part of the book addresses other 19th century literary vampires and their influence on Polidori, Le Fanu, and Stoker. This is interesting, because that century's vampire stories are closely related.<br /><br />For those who aren't familiar with the legend, I'll briefly describe the events of July 1816 at the Villa Diodati on Lake Geneva to which so much of the 19th century's vampire literature can be connected by some means: Lord Byron, his personal physician John Polidori, poet Percy Shelley, and his wife-to-be, Mary Godwin were staying at the Villa and, on one rainy evening, entertaining themselves by reading poetry aloud. After the recitation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \\"Christabel\\" provoked some sort of panic attack in Shelley, Lord Byron proposed that each member of the party write a ghost story. \\"Christabel\\" was the inspiration for Le Fanu's \\"Carmilla\\". Two notable works of fiction emerged from this writing exercise. Mary Shelley wrote \\"Frankenstein\\". John Polidori wrote \\"The Vampyre\\", based on a fragment that Lord Byron wrote but never finished. Polidori published the story under Byron's name to boost sales, and Byron subsequently fired him.<br /><br />Part One of \\"Three Vampire Tales\\" includes a fragment of Lord Byron's poem \\"The Gaiour\\", the story fragment upon which Polidori based his story, the introduction that Polidori wrote to \\"The Vampyre\\", most of the poem \\"Christabel\\", an except from the penny-dreadful \\"Varney the Vampyre\\", 3 excepts by \\"Dracula\\" scholars Christopher Frayling and Elizabeth Miller about Bram Stoker's sources for \\"Dracula\\", including a source list from Stoker's notes, and the\\"lost chapter\\", \\"Dracula's Guest\\", which Stoker at one point intended to be \\"Dracula\\"'s opening chapter. Emulating \\"Carmilla\\", it takes place in Styria. So this is a nice selection of the works that led up to and influenced the more prominent \\"Three Vampire Tales\\". There are also chronologies for Polidori, Le Fanu, and Stoker in the back of the book. And there is a vampire filmography that lists title, date, and director by year. I don't know if this is supposed to be a comprehensive list of vampire films, but there are about 200, so it might be.which Stoker at one point intended to be \\"Dracula\\"'s opening chapter.

The authors, Dr. Andrew Weil and Winifred Rosen, are forthright about their perspective: \\"We cannot say that we have no biases about drugs, but we think that we know what our biases are.\\" They don't generally encourage or discourage recreational drug use. Instead, they repeatedly emphasize the necessity of education and avoiding dependency if one is to use drugs beneficially. I say \\"generally\\", because the authors' tone betrays obvious disdain for a few drugs and affection for some others.<br /><br />The authors outline their viewpoint and purpose in the book's first chapter, where they also offer some rather silly advice to parents, teachers, and teens on communicating about drugs. But the book improves from there. Chapters 2-5 provide basic information: What is a Drug, Why People Use Drugs, Relationships with Drugs, and Types of Drugs. This is followed by chapters on Stimulants, Depressants, Psychedelics, Marijuana, a sort of catch-all chapter on Solvents and Inhalants/Deliriants/PCP and Ketamine, and Medical Drugs/Herbal Remedies/Smart Drugs. The information on each drug is not what I would call complete, and it probably isn't meant to be. Caffeine is handled poorly. Its immunosuppressant, diuretic, and damaging effects on the linings of blood vessels are not mentioned. On the other hand, the cases against tobacco and alcohol may be overstated. The book is very hard on heroin, speaks well of marijuana, but omits glaucoma treatment when discussing medicinal uses. The authors don't like anti-depressants, especially SSRIs. I can't say that I blame them, but, oddly, they are more harsh when discussing antihistamines. Descriptions for each drug contain history and basic information on uses, effects, and dangers. One of the best features of \\"From Chocolate to Morphine\\" is the Suggested Reading at the end of each chapter, which provides a list of related books and films for those readers who would like more detailed information.<br /><br />The final chapters of the book address Problems with Drugs, Alternatives to Drugs, and the authors give us some Final Words on the subject of drug use -including some interesting advice regarding the treatment of drug addiction. The Appendix contains about 40 pages of interesting \\"First Person Accounts and Comments\\" on drug use, and is followed by a glossary and an index. Dr. Andrew Weil and Winifred Rosen don't hide their contempt for the current drug hysteria and drug policies in the United States. Nor do they deny how easy it is to become dependent on drugs if they are used carelessly or for the wrong reasons. \\"From Chocolate to Morphine\\" isn't a definitive work on psychoactive drugs, but it's a good primer that is easy to read. Those who intend to use any of these drugs on a regular basis will want more detailed information, for which the Suggested Reading sections are excellent guides.tain history and basic information on uses, effects, and dangers.

It contains 140 beautiful photographs of snow crystals and snowflakes, taken by Kenneth Libbrecht and his traveling photomicroscope. 45 of the photographs are full page, which in this case means 5 1/2 inches (14 cm) square. I'm not sure if any of the photographs duplicate those found in \\"Winter's Secret Beauty\\", but most of them don't. If you haven't seen either of these books, the photographs are so beautiful that they must be seen to be believed. The text in \\"The Little Book of Snowflakes\\" is sparse. It consists of basic information from the author on how snowflakes are formed and 30 quotations on the subjects of snow and nature by an assortment of notable names, from Aristotle to Hsiao Tung to William Blake to Albert Einstein to Yogi Berra. As with it's companion book, the price of \\"The Little Book of Snowflakes' belies the quality of its contents. It makes a wonderful gift for the photographer, nature lover, aesthete -or anyone who has had too much or too little of the white stuff outside. Kenneth Libbrecht puts snow in a new light. For those who couldn't get enough of the photographs in \\"Winter's Secret Beauty\\", this little book is a welcome addition.<br /><br />Kenneth Libbrecht is a physics professor at CalTech, and he has an excellent web site: [...] . Whatever else Libbrecht may accomplish in his field, the publication of \\"The Snowflake: Winter's Secret Beauty\\" and \\"The Little Book of Snowflakes\\" seem to ensure his place in popular history as a \\"snowflake man\\", an epithet previously earned only by Wilson Bentley a century ago. If you like this book, be sure to check out \\"The Snowflake: Winter's Secret Beauty\\" for more photographs and detailed information about the formation and identification of snow crystals.	2005-02-17

Having expounded on the connection between the fictional Count Dracula of Bram Stoker's 19th century novel and the real Prince Vlad Dracula who ruled 15th century Wallachia in their book \\"The Search for Dracula\\", professors Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally subsequently wrote \\"Dracula: Prince of Many Faces\\", a meticulously researched biography of the real-life warrior prince. This book starts with an overview of the extremely convoluted political landscape of 15th century Europe, in particular that of Wallachia, in present day Romania, when Vlad Tepes, also called Vlad Dracula, ruled for only 6 years in the mid-15th century. The authors follow Dracula into his youth, spent as a hostage held to insure his father's obedience in the court of the Ottoman Sultan Murad II, among many distinguished fellow hostages and tutors. Dracula demonstrated his military competency even before securing the throne of Wallachia, having been instrumental in the defense of Belgrade from invading Ottomans. During his rule of Wallachia, the Prince would ruthlessly advance an agenda of centralized power, draconian law, and military might that earned him a reputation as one of history's most excessively cruel and murderous personalities, while at the same time his defeat of the Turkish army during the 1461-1462 Turco-Wallachian war did no less than stop the Ottoman advance into Europe and make Vlad Dracula a hero of Christendom.<br /><br />The historical information in \\"Dracula: Prince of Many Faces\\" accounts for most of its contents, and it is where the book excels. There are also chapters on Vlad Dracula's descendants and the sources of his considerable notoriety in his own time, when he was regarded as a maniacal tyrant by the Germans, Hungarians, and Turks, and as a savior by many of his own people. One risks engaging in presentism by applying moral judgments to Dracula's actions 6 centuries after the fact. But the Wallachian Prince was excessively sadistic even by the standards of his own time, to which his far-flung reputation attests.<br /><br />\\"Dracula: Prince of Many Faces\\"' weaknesses are its attempts at psychoanalyzing Vlad Dracula and its insistence that Bram Stoker based his fictional vampire, Count Dracula, on the 15th century prince. The authors use words like \\"clearly\\", \\"undoubtedly\\", and \\"obviously\\" too often to draw conclusions about Vlad Tepes' motives that require considerable leaps of faith. \\"Prince of Many Faces\\" indulges in Freudian and behaviorist speculation about Vlad Dracula's character while ignoring what I would consider to be a simple observation about his personality: Vlad Dracula was extremely uncomfortable with behavior that is not orderly, predictable, and regimented. Hence his obsession with protocol, insistence upon strict adherence to rigid laws, and inability to see anything in shades of gray, as opposed to black and white.  It is not an uncommon personality trait, but it's not desirable in persons of power. As for the Vlad Dracula-Count Dracula connection, I have read 2 books on the subject by authors Florescu and McNally, and I still see no more of Vlad Tepes in Count Dracula than his name and vague ancestry (\\"one of my race who as a Viovode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his ground\\"), mostly because the novel \\"Dracula\\" contradicts itself repeatedly in describing Count Dracula. Bram Stoker certainly referenced Vlad Tepes, but it seems more to evoke a sense of grandeur and history than to assign a specific identity.own time, to which his far-flung reputation attests.  <br /> <br />\\"Dracula: Prince of Many Faces\\"' weaknesses are its attempts at psychoanalyzing Vlad Dracula and its insistence that Bram Stoker based his fictional vampire, Count Dracula, on the 15th century prince.

Rather it is a survey of the genre literally from \\"Nosferatu\\" to \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\". It encompasses 70 years of vampire films, through 1992, the second edition of the book being published in 1993. It's not as detailed as those familiar with Alain Silver's books on film noir might expect, but \\"The Vampire Film\\" is a solid analysis of the genre for students of film and vampire aficionados. The style is academic. Authors Silver and Ursini analyze the evolution of this horror sub-genre that, although consistently populated by vampires, encompasses everything from romantic expressionist to exploitation films.<br /><br />The first chapter, \\"Sources of Vampire Lore in Film\\", discusses vampire folklore, including hypotheses as to why it is so universal, real people with blood fetishes, from the 15th century's Gilles de Rai to the mid-20th century's John Haigh, and vampires in literature. Chapter 2, \\"The Male Vampire\\", talks about the Count Dracula character and films, in particular, as well as Mexican vampire films of the 1950s and 1960s, Hammer Studio films, and sympathetic vampires. In Chapter 3, \\"The Female Vampire\\" gets a similar treatment with analysis of the films inspired by the 16th century Hungarian Countess and murderess Elisabeth Bathory and Sheridan Le Fanu's novella \\"Carmilla\\", including Carl Dreyer's 1932 expressionist masterwork \\"Vampyr\\". Chapter 4, \\"Emerging Traditions\\", serves as a segway between the first and second halves of the book. Since, as of 1993, 90 percent of vampire films had been made since 1958's \\"Horror of Dracula\\", this chapter discusses some of the characteristics of these modern films. Chapters 5 and 6 have confusing titles. They address vampire films made between 1972 and 1992, as the previous chapters on male and female vampires include films almost exclusively before that period. Chapter 5 is entitled \\"Dracula A.D. 1992\\" and talks about the trends toward gothic romance, comedy, teen movies, and vampires who lament their endless, sunless existence in films from 1972-1992. Chapter 6, \\"Countess Dracula A.D. 1992\\", explores the various cinematic interpretations of Carmilla, Elizabeth Bathory, and other female vampires 1972-1992. The last chapter, \\"The Multimedia Vampire\\", summarizes the state of vampires in modern media other than film: literature, television, and \\"natural\\" vampires, meaning people who really drink blood.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out to solve the mystery amid increasing paranoia and suspicion in their classmates.<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets\\" is the best of the 5 books thus far in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. They're all page-turners, but \\"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets\\" is particularly well-constructed and perfectly paced. It builds steadily to a climax that 's a little more interesting than the other books. As always, Harry discovers a few more pieces to the puzzle of his past. At this point, the reader is as anxious to understand his family and their nemesis, the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, as Harry is. J.K. Rowling understands the appeal of ongoing mystery and the expectation of payoff. So she gives her readers both in each book. \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is particularly satisfying.<br /><br />The Leather Collector's Edition (ISBN 0439203538): The \\"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets\\" Collector's Edition is bound in red textured leather with gold lettering and design embossed on the cover and spine, and matching gold design on the back.

Rowling tells the story of an orphaned boy who, on his 11th birthday, discovers that he is a wizard in a long line of wizards. Having been neglected and harassed, alternately, all his life, by his adoptive family, the boy now finds himself at a school for wizards where he fits in, is respected, makes friends, and has great adventures. A fairy tale. A story that might amuse and inspire children, but at first glance not the makings of an international phenomenon that would enchant adults as well. But J.K. Rowling has created vivid characters whose fears and aspirations are immediately understood by all. She writes with a great sense of humor. And her evocative descriptions of the wizard world create a universe so colorful that it captures the imaginations of young and old alike. Readers want to return to that world time and again, because it is simply delightful to visit. \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is one of the rare books that doesn't give children's literature a bad name. Intended for readers 8-12 years old, it doesn't insult their intelligence, their reading ability, or subject them to illiterate drivel. The young characters are smart, curious, and independent. They use logic, research, and good old-fashioned mischief-making to understand the world they inhabit. I can't think of a more appealing context in which to encourage children to read and explore. \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a fast, fun read that is thematically complex enough for adults and straightforward enough even for young children.<br /><br />The wizard boy is Harry Potter. Orphaned in infancy, Harry doesn't remembered his parents, but he bears a scar from the \\"accident\\" that killed them: a peculiar scar in the shape of a lightning bolt on his forehead. Left to live with his Aunt and Uncle, who dislike him, and their son Dudley, who torments him, Harry has learned to find joy in small things and not to expect anything more. Shortly before the start of his first secondary school year (equivalent to the 6th grade), Harry, to his considerable surprise, begins to receive letters in the mail. His Uncle Vernon is determined to keep the letters from him, but they just keep coming. Vernon becomes so desperate that he takes the family on a road trip to escape the deluge. But he cannot. For inside those letters is Harry's heritage and his destiny, the knowledge that he is a wizard, and a famous one at that. So off he goes to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, with more questions than answers about who he is and how he came to be that way. Together with two new-found friends, a friendly boy named Ron Weasley and a bright overachieving girl named Hermione Granger, Harry will embark on exciting and mysterious adventures, learn a few lessons, and stir up a lot of trouble as he begins to discover the answers to his nagging questions.<br /><br />The Leather Collector's Edition (ISBN 043920352X): The \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" Collector's Edition is bound in dark green textured leather with gold lettering and design embossed on the cover and spine, and matching gold design on the back.

It borrows from the earlier Balderston/Deane play, the most famous of \\"Dracula\\" theatrical adaptations, on which several films and many stage productions have been based. But Tiller's play is tightly constructed and entertaining in its own right. And the Count Dracula character is thankfully more sinister than envisioned by Hamilton Deane. It's a good adaptation with engaging dialogue and a menacing villain that hold the audience's interest.<br /><br />Tiller places the action in England of the 1930s, in the living quarters of Dr. Arthur Seward on the premises of the Asylum for the Insane, of which he is the resident psychiatrist and chief administrator. The set is a living room (or parlor) with arched ceilings and stone columns that reveal its gothic origins, large French windows, a fireplace, furnishings, and several entrances and exits, including a secret panel. All but the play's last scene take place in this room. The last scene takes place in a crypt, into which the living room can be transformed by moving the furniture and pulling a curtain across the center of the stage. Several scenes call for special effects or slight of hand. Most of these can be reproduced with primitive technology or dispensed with, making \\"Count Dracula\\" a production suitable for high schools and community theaters -except for one thing: 3 scenes call for a large fake bat to be flown around that set and, on one occasion, into the auditorium. So you need to have the necessary rigging.<br /><br />In this version of the Dracula story, Dr. Seward is a psychiatrist living at his workplace with his spinster sister, Sybil, who is harmlessly and slightly \\"touched in the head\\". Seward's ward, a young woman named Mina, is also there and has recently become ill with sudden bouts of lethargy and symptoms of anemia. All of the characters are brought together when the Seward's invite Mina's fianc&eacute;e, a young architect name Jonathan Harker, Professor Heinreich Van Helsing, a rare disease specialist and friend of Seward's from abroad, and Count Dracula, a Transylvanian aristocrat who has recently arrived in England, to dinner. Upon seeing Mina, Van Helsing realizes the cause of her illness and tries to convince Jonathan and Dr. Seward, who aren't inclined to believe in vampires. By Act 2, all are convinced that Dracula is preying on Mina, but their attempts to hold him at bay are frustrated. In Act 3, the men confront Dracula and attempt to detain him until the sun rises, which will bring his death. Again, they are foiled. So they follow Dracula to the crypt in his home and destroy him there. The end is anticlimactic, but it always is, even in Stoker's novel.<br /><br />There isn't time to develop any characters, so Count Dracula is unlikable from the beginning. He is rude and sarcastic, so the audience has no trouble thinking him a predatory menace. In this play, Dracula possesses the powers of hypnotism, transfiguration (into a bat), and the ability to produce fire. His inability to survive sunlight or cast a reflection in a mirror are his limitations. All are used to propel the story forward. The character of Sybil is both an enabling device for certain actions and comic character. Her vanity and jealousy make her simultaneously empathetic and annoying. In the hands of the right actress, Sybil can capture the audience's interest and draw them in. The other characters are more or less what you would expect, except that Arthur Seward is middle-aged, even though he is a composite of the novel's Arthur Holmwood and Dr. Seward, who are both young men.<br /><br />Instructions for all of the slight of hand and special effects are found in the back of the book, followed by property plot with detailed descriptions of all props, a detailed costume plot, and descriptions of all characters. There are 2 helpful diagrams of the set design byPeter Harris.	2005-01-13

Interesting & Enjoyable.	\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is a detective tale of sorts, as told by a fictional autistic teenager named Christopher Boone. Christopher lives with his father and attends a special needs school, where he excels in mathematics, which he loves, and struggles with social interactions. He admires logic, loves animals, and cannot comprehend human emotions or motivations. One night, he discovers that a neighbor's dog, Wellington, has died, apparently murdered with a pitchfork. Concerned that a killer is on the loose and eager to test his detecting skills, Christopher determines to figure out who killed the dog. Against his father's admonishments, he sets about interviewing neighbors and applying logic to the few clues that he has, emulating his favorite fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes. In searching for Wellington's killer, Christopher discovers things about his own family that he could never understand, but which affect them all profoundly.<br /><br />Author Mark Haddon, who worked with autistic individuals as a young man, has avoided the pitfall of underdeveloped style that afflicts so many first-time (and beyond) novelists by writing his book in the first person, as an autistic youth, whose style is of necessity blunt, unrefined, and frequently tangential. He has cleverly turned a stylistic challenge into the essence of the book: the perspective of an autistic mind. \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is more about how autistic individuals perceive the world than anything else. The story, itself, consumes Christopher, but would only be of mild interest to others. We learn a lot about Christopher, as he hides nothing, but his character is not so much sympathetic as fascinating. It's not that the reader doesn't care about Christopher, but eagerness to know what Christopher thinks -how he will solve a problem- made this a page-turner for me more than how he feels. I guess Christopher and those like him would approve. Christopher notices details of his environment that most people don't. And he's blind to aspects of life that most people consider obvious. Yet he lives among humans whom he will never be able to understand, and he must learn to function among us. As all humans (and animals) perceive various aspects of their environment differently and to varying degrees, it is intriguing to learn about one extreme of human perception. \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is an enjoyable and enlightening read.r notices details of his environment that most people don't.

In \\"Dark City Dames\\", Muller presents then-and-now biographies of 6 actresses whose portrayals of femmes fatales will forever fix their images on the consciousness of film noir audiences. The first half of the book, entitled \\"Hollywood Midcentury\\", introduces us to these women, who came to Hollywood from a variety of backgrounds and locales, but all aspired to be movie actresses and were under contract to one studio or another in the late 1940s and early 1950s.<br /><br />Jane Greer was brought to Hollywood from Washington, D.C. as a teenager under contract to RKO. She made \\"Out of the Past\\" and \\"The Big Steal\\", among others, before Howard Hughes vowed to end her career. Audrey Totter was straight-laced, professional, and ambitious. She acted in 6 film noirs, among them \\"The Lady in the Lake\\", \\"The Unsuspected\\", \\"Alias Nick Beal\\", and \\"The Set-Up\\" before remarkable coincidence began her married life and ended her film career, just as coincidence had launched it. Marie Windsor was the pride of Marysvale, Utah, who had dreamed of being an actress since childhood. Pragmatic and persistent, her dark hair made her the villain in \\"The Narrow Margin\\", \\"Force of Evil\\", and \\"The Killing\\". Evelyn Keyes was backwards and unworldly when Cecile B. DeMille signed her. But her persistent curiosity and independent nature inspired her to many Hollywood adventures. Her films included \\"Johnny O'Clock\\" and \\"The Prowler\\" , before she walked away from Hollywood after 13 years in the business. Coleen Gray was an insecure midwestern farmer's daughter, but you wouldn't know it from \\"The Sleeping City\\", \\"Nightmare Alley\\", or \\"Kiss of Death\\". Anne Savage was headstrong and vivacious, as her stage name implies. She will be best remembered for \\"Detour\\", which might have ended her decade-long acting career.<br /><br />In the second part of \\"Dark City Dames\\", \\"Hollywood Fin de Si&egrave;cle\\", we meet the 6 actresses today. Now in their 70s and 80s, the ladies of film noir tell us what happened as their film careers dwindled and what they've done since. It's interesting that the revived interest in classic film noir has brought these actresses a lot of unexpected attention and praise that was lacking when it would have helped their careers. Several of them lament the demise of the studio system that protected actors even as it limited them -and studio politics ended many careers prematurely. All of the actresses profiled cooperated with the author, so their stories are personal and very much their point of view. \\"Dark City Dames\\" doesn't actually say much about the films or the characters these actresses embodied. It's about the experiences of its 6 heroines, who, as young starlets in post-war Hollywood, probably aspired to be A-list stars, but became indelible vixens of film noir instead.nd part of \\"Dark City Dames\\", \\"Hollywood Fin de Sicle\\", we meet the 6 actresses today.

US	44189182	RNLSH7AECABZ7	0684828030	972118661	Somewhere in the Night	Books	4	18	18	N	N	Elaborate Exploration of Classic Noir's Urban Jungle.	\\"Somewhere in the Night\\" is a treatise on film noir focusing on the characteristics of the post-WWII urban environment which spawned and defined the style. Novelist and poet Nicholas Christopher draws on a wider variety of sources to explain film noir than most film theorists do, including social pundits, historians, artists, and film critics. The discussion of film noir's influences goes so far beyond the traditional expressionism and post-War conditions that the connection is sometimes dubious, but always interesting. \\"Somewhere in the Night\\" almost overlooks the first 5 or so years of film noir, picking it up as the style peaks, in the mid-1940s. Each of the book's 8 chapters discusses a characteristic of the Noir City, and most include in-depth analysis of a few films that exemplify that quality. Most discussion is of classic film noir until the last chapter, which is dedicated to neo-noir. Readers will benefit from having some knowledge of film noir theory and history before embarking on this book, since the author presents an elaborate and personal picture of the social circumstances into which film noir emerged but doesn't cover the basics. \\"Somewhere in the Night\\" is a  thoughtful dissertation for film noir buffs, by a film noir buff. The films mentioned below are not by any means the only films discussed, but the ones which receive exhaustive treatment.<br /><br />Chapter 1, \\"Into the Labyrinth\\", introduces the reader to the literal and figurative urban labyrinth, a man-made web of treachery, which the heroes of film noir are compelled to navigate. \\"Out of the Past\\" (1947) and \\"Kiss Me Deadly\\" (1955) get in-depth analysis. Chapter 2, \\"Night and the City\\", discusses how the aftermath of WWII -the fears of the nuclear age, the paranoia of the Cold War, and the disillusionment of veterans- influenced film. Chapter 3, \\"Postcards from the Ruins\\", analyses 3 films that feature Americans in devastated European cities: \\"Berlin Express\\" (1948), \\"The Third Man\\" (1949), and \\"Night and the City\\" (1950). Chapter 4, \\"Office Buildings and Casinos\\", explores the increased sense of isolation produced by technologies and the corporate \\"rat race\\", reflected in characters' gravitation to omnipresent office buildings or casinos. 3 office work films are analyzed: \\"Forces of Evil\\" (1948), \\"The Big Clock\\" (1948), and \\"The Blue Gardenia\\" (1953), as well as 4 casino films: \\"Dead Reckoning\\" (1947), \\"Criss Cross\\" (1949), and \\"The Shanghai Gesture\\" (1941), and \\"Gilda\\" (1946). Chapter 5, \\"Grafters, Grifters, and Tycoons\\", discusses money as the foundation of the noir city, manifested as artwork, gangsters, or political corruption. Films analyzed are \\"The Street with No Name\\" (1948), \\"T-Men\\" (1947), \\"The Set-Up\\" (1949), and \\"Caught\\" (1949). Chapter 6, \\"The Dark Mirror: Sex, Dreams, and Psychoanalysis\\", talks about noir's sexual obsessions, previously not depicted in film, the femme fatale, and Freudian psychoanalysis in cinema. \\"Gun Crazy\\" (1950), \\"Nightmare Alley\\" (1947), \\"The Accused\\" (1949), and \\"Cat People\\" (1942) are analyzed. Chapter 7, \\"Black and White in Color\\", talks about the symbolic use of color in color film noir, going back to 1945's \\"Leave Her to Heaven\\". Chapter 8, \\"Paint It Black\\", is about neo-noir. The failure of re-made classic noirs and the success of original material and never-before-adapted pulp novels are discussed, with analysis of \\"The Usual Suspects\\" (1995).

The book's 9 chapters satirize Democracy, The Founding of America, the President, Congress, The Judicial Branch, Campaigns and Elections, The Media, The Future of Democracy, and The Rest of the World through text and a host of colorful charts and diagrams. Not surprisingly, the writers of \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\\" are better at lampooning modern American politics (in the second half of the book) than at mocking its history (in the first half of the book).<br /><br />I found the first 5 chapters of \\"America\\", which discuss US history and the branches of government, extremely dull. The humor is sophomoric, the history inaccurate, and the authors are oddly mean-spirited toward individuals who lived centuries ago and couldn't have done anything to incur the ire of post-modern comics. It may seem unjust to criticize \\"America\\" for not being factual, as the book aims for laughs, not accuracy. But  the difference between historical fact and fiction would not be obvious unless the reader had a strong grasp of these subjects. The authors have chosen, in many cases, to invent history instead of satirizing the real thing. I suppose this is easier, but I don't see the need to misrepresent people and events when truth is often funnier than fiction anyway.<br /><br />Jon Stewart and his fellow \\"Daily Show\\" writers are more in their element in chapters 6-9, which mockingly discuss election campaigns, the news media, and other nations. The  funniest and most insightful chapter is \\"Campaigns and Elections: America Changes the Sheets\\", perhaps due to the immediacy of the subject. \\"The Media: Democracy's Guardian Angel\\" is the most elaborate chapter, with 20 pages of charts and illustrations, including a guide to the 5 current media giants, a formula to help television journalists find the perfect name, and an all-to-true cheat sheet for \\"Determining Newsworthiness\\". \\"The Rest of the World\\" is an amusing look at the dangers and indignities that lurk elsewhere. There is a 15-page guide to the 2004 presidential election in the back of the book that is not listed in the Table of Contents.<br /><br />In reading \\"America\\", I was continually impressed by the book's superb design (by Pentagram) and the authors' imaginations. As for the humor, it is too often sophomoric and too seldom clever.  The book's second half is funnier and more insightful than its first. \\"America\\" has a liberal bent, but does not hesitate to skewer Democrats. The authors cannot hide -and presumably make no attempt to hide- a stereotypically \\"liberal\\" bias that is unnaturally preoccupied with \\"disenfranchisement\\" and colonialism.

Author Anne Hollander is an art historian who chooses to view dress as art, not as specifically symbolic of socio-political circumstances. I found this a welcome limitation. Although the creation of fashion 600 years ago was, indeed, the result of an extraordinary change in the self-images of Western humans, there is more than enough fascinating and revealing material to be covered in discussing fashion in its own right. Hollander asserts that male fashion has always been the avant-garde, with women's fashion only recently having caught up. And she focuses particularly on the evolution of the tailored suit, that neo-classic staple of truly modern dress that appeared in its current form about 2 centuries ago.<br /><br />\\"Sex and Suits\\" observes that fashion came to be in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, when men and women began to express their sex by dressing differently, although still making use of the same basic forms and ornamentation. The author then notes the divergence, if not actually schism, that occurred during the 17th century with the formation of the first professional dressmakers guild. Then, for the first time, women designed and constructed women's clothes and male tailors made men's, creating a difference in the way clothes were conceived and made that would take 150 years to change and whose effects last into our own time. As the 19th century approaches, the book temporarily abandons discussion of female fashion to concentrate on the genesis of the modern male suit, the quintessence of Modern Fashion. The suit is described and lauded from its neo-classicist roots to its only slightly altered contemporary form. Eventually, we pick up the progression of women's fashion again, from the first male \\"fashion designers\\" for women in mid-19th century Paris, to the late-19th and early-20th century, when women's fashion finally became modern, on to the throwback years of the 1950s, with its conformity and frivolity. The second half of the 20th century sees men's and women's fashion become thoroughly modern, converging and borrowing from one another, including the universal adoption of jeans and t-shirts that were previously men's work clothes and undergarments.<br /><br />The last section of \\"Sex and Suits\\" offers an interesting essay on how and why contemporary people choose to dress as they do. Anne Hollander sees fashion, itself, as a good thing with great personal and social implications, but never calls any particular fashion either good or bad. She explains what the fashion was and why . Her prose is literate and packed with detail. \\"Sex and Suits\\" shows us just how much has been and continues to be communicated through dress, and banishes the thought that clothes are unimportant.century Paris, to the late-19th and early-20th century, when women's fashion finally became modern, on to the throwback years of the 1950s, with its conformity and frivolity.

In 1946, French critic Nino Frank gave the cynical, existential, expressionist, and often erotic crime thrillers that Hollywood had been producing since around 1940 a name. He called them \\"film noir\\", after \\"s&eacute;rie noire\\", the French expression used to describe crime and detective novels. In 1955, Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton, film scholars from Toulouse, France, gave \\"film noir\\" an identity. They published \\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\", which became the basis of all film noir theory that followed. This 2002 edition is the first time the book has been published in its entirety in English.<br /><br />Noir theorist James Naremore has written a valuable new introduction to the book, in which is explains the reception that American film noir received in France in the post-war era, the Surrealist environment from which noir film theory emerged,  and why \\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\" was so influential.<br /><br />\\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\", attempts to define \\"film noir\\", identify its sources and influences, and to document its rise and fall. The first three chapters focus on definitions and sources, from the obvious hard-boiled crime novels to the events of WWII. \\"The War Years and the Formation of a Style\\" follows the genesis of film noir from 1941-1945. \\"The Glory Days\\" explores the apogee of film noir, when films such as \\"Gilda\\", \\"The Big Sleep\\", \\"Sorry, Wrong Number\\", and a trio from Alfred Hitchcock exemplified a fully developed style, 1946-1948. \\"Decadence and Transformation\\" traces noir's shift toward realism and location shoots in the period 1949-1950. And \\"The Demise of a Series\\" discusses some of the last true film noirs of the classic era, 1951-1953, as Hollywood moved toward escapism. Two chapters, \\"Influences\\" and \\"French Film Noir\\" discuss the role of psychoanalysis and crime films in film noir, as well as noir's influence on the cinematic traditions of Italy, France, and England. In the book's final chapter, \\"A Balance Sheet\\", the authors summarize the characteristics of film noir, its sources,  history, and repercussions. They also explain \\"A Panorama of Film Noir\\"'s purpose, limitations, and methodology with impressive foresight. The authors added a Postface in 1979.<br /><br />In the back of the book, you will find a chronology of major film noirs 1941-1954 and an alphabetical filmography that includes titles from the 1955 original publication plus those referred to in the 1979 postface. There is an index of films, books, periodicals, names and various related works of art.<br /><br />The prose of \\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\" can be awkward at times. Translator Paul Hammond has chosen, correctly, to convey the meaning of the French as closely as possible, if it means sacrificing fluidity. \\"Influences\\" and \\" French Film Noir\\" are particularly disjointed. This treatise was written for academics, not the average movie-goer, and employed a new vocabulary at the time, so I don't suppose one can expect it to be eloquent. \\"A Panorama of American Film Noir\\" is noir theory's seminal work and an insightful and essential read for film noir enthusiasts.\\", the authors summarize the characteristics of film noir, its sources,  history, and repercussions.

In the summer of 1999, prolonged drought and increased ivory poaching brought brought more orphaned baby elephants to the Trust in one season that it had seen in the entire previous decade. Gerry Ellis followed, photographed, and got to know 8 of the young elephants who were one month to one year old when they arrived at the Wildlife Trust. Through more than 100 photographs and accompanying text, we meet the \\"Orphan 8\\", learn of the challenges of raising them, observe as the youngsters recover from their injuries and fear, adjust to life at the Trust, develop relationships with one another and with their human keepers, and, after 2 years, move to Tsavo National Park, where they will eventually be released into the wild. An essay by Gerry Ellis introduces each of the book's 6 chapters. Detailed explanations accompany all photographs -not as captions, but full-sized text. I've long been a fan of Gerry Ellis' fine art nature photography, but \\"Wild Orphans\\" is fantastic photojournalism and more personal work than I have seen from Ellis before. Ellis' love for this project shows. Admirers of elephants and those concerned with their fate -or that of African wildlife in general- won't want to miss \\"Wild Orphans\\".	2004-11-20
US	44189182	R4U0PZCXXKQRO	0879514795	529795204	Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style, Third Edition	Books	5	54	55	N	N	The Essential Classic Film Noir Reference.	This 3rd edition of \\"Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style\\" provides descriptions and analysis for nearly 300 film noirs that were produced from 1927 to 1976, concentrating on the classic period, 1940-1958. The authors are strict in defining film noir as a movement and a style -not a genre- molded specifically by the social, economic, technical, and aesthetic circumstances in post-WWII America, and therefore confined to that era. They exclude genre and foreign films produced in the post-war era that other critics might include. So \\"Film Noir\\" is a reference of \\"pure noir\\" of the classic period. It may be just as well that it doesn't explore impure noir in much depth, as this book is quite large as it is.<br /><br />The authors introduce the book by defining the uniquely American classic noir style and discussing some of its common characteristics. The Encyclopedia, itself, is 314 pages long and organized alphabetically by film title. The entry for each of the nearly 300 classic noir films included provides, wherever applicable: the film's title (including working and alternate titles), it's year of release, director, producer, screenwriter(s), director of photography, music director, persons responsible for special effects, sound, score, set decoration, costumes, make-up, the production designer and/or art director, assistant director, and editor. This is followed by a cast list -divided into main and \\"bit\\" cast, the date filming was completed, the date the film was released, running time, a plot summary, and a critical analysis by one of the book's 18 contributors. The plot and analysis do often contain spoilers, including endings and surprise twists, which is probably necessary to provide analysis and to define the film as \\"noir\\". The plot summaries are useful in refreshing my memory of films seen long ago, but I avoid reading the entire summary or commentary for films I have not yet seen.<br /><br />\\"Film Noir\\" has 5 informative Appendices that explore topics and films not covered in the main section of the book. Appendix A is a lengthy essay explaining the rationale for excluding genre films from the film noir movement. It addresses The Gangster Film, The Western, The Period Film, and The Comedy separately, discussing films that reflect the noir style and what they share and do not share with film noir. Appendix B is a series of lists: A chronology of film noir, listed by year, 1927-1976. Directors listed alphabetically with their films. The same for Writers, Directors of Photography, Composers, Producers, Actors & Actresses, and Releasing Companies, each category with its own list. The criterion for inclusion in the lists is participation in at least 2 film noirs. Appendix C is a survey of \\"Other Studies in Film Noir\\". It comments on significant articles and books published on the subject of film noir, from 1955's seminal work by Borde & Chaumeton, \\"A Panorama of  American Film Noir\\", through 1992, when the latest edition of this book was published. Appendix D discusses \\"Additional Films from the Classic Period\\" which were not included in the earlier editions of the book, because they were unavailable or overlooked. Here, 50 films are discussed according to their characteristic noir elements -femme fatale, alienation & despair, maniacs & mayhem, etc. Why these films were simply not included in the Encyclopedia section of this 3rd edition is a mystery to me. Appendix E is a lengthy discussion of Neo-Noir,1966-1992, including a filmography. In the back of the book, you will find a fairly comprehensive Index of films, names, book titles, and most references you might want to locate in \\"Film Noir\\".<br /><br />Film Noir aficionados and students will find \\"An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style\\" endlessly fascinating and useful. The critical analyses are thoughtful. The authors' inclusions, exclusions, and definitions of classic noir are always well-articulated and thought-provoking. A single source that collects the production details for each film is a big time-saver.oduction details for each film is a big time-saver.	2004-11-14
US	44189182	RYBDNQY6GS8LF	0936262508	137923539	The Art of Infrared Photography	Books	3	18	20	N	N	Easy-to-Follow, but Not Even Close to Comprehensive.	\\"The Art of Infrared Photography\\" isn't a bad book. It's mediocre and incomplete. Joseph Paduano's instructions are straightforward and easy to understand. To the author's credit, he doesn't make infrared photography out to be more difficult than it is. But the book doesn't give the reader an understanding of the choices and styles that infrared photography offers. On one hand, it ventures into color infrared photography. On the other hand, its black-and-white chapters concentrate solely on \\"hard\\" infrared -black skies and white foliage shot with red filters, ignoring the tonal qualities of IR film that make it ideal for use with orange and yellow filters. There is almost no discussion of portraits, a very popular use of b&w IR film. Perhaps that's because Mr. Paduano has written another book, \\"Infrared Nude Photography\\", on that subject.<br /><br />Chapter 1, \\"Infrared Theory\\", explains how IR film works and how various subjects will appear when photographed with b&w IR film. The films discussed are Kodak High Speed Infrared and Konica Infrared 750, as they are available in the US. Chapter 2, \\"Precautions\\", tells the reader how to load and handle IR film to prevent fogging. Paduano recommends placing film in a lead film shield bag to protect it from airport x-rays. Airport security personnel simply turn up the x-ray if they can't see through a bag. IR film cannot be put through x-ray.<br /><br />Chapter 3, \\"Filters & Focusing\\", provides good information on which red filters transmit which wavelengths of light, but incorrectly asserts that you need to increase exposure by the amount of the filter factor. IR light passes through red filters, so conventional filter factors should be ignored. There is no discussion of using yellow filters with IR film, which many of the most accomplished IR photographers prefer. You don't get white foliage and black skies with a yellow or orange filter. Instead those filters exploit one of IR film's most interesting qualities: increased tonal separation in the midtones. If you photograph a midtoned subject that has multiple subtle hues, you will see remarkable separation that you would not with panchromatic film. \\"The Art of Infrared Photography\\" ignores this style of IR photography, which is often it's most beautiful. Chapter 4 discusses \\"Film Speed & Grain\\".<br /><br />Chapter 5, \\"Exposure\\", provides exposure recommendations for Kodak High Speed Infrared and Konica Infrared 750 used outdoors with a medium red filter. I think his recommendations give too much exposure, because he has translated the filter factor as you would for panchromatic film. But, as you should always bracket when shooting IR, the correct exposure should be obvious in the negatives. Chapter 6 is about \\"Night & Flash Photography\\".<br /><br />Chapter 7, \\"Developing & Printing\\", gives developing times and temperatures for Kodak High Speed IR, Konica IR 750, AgfaPan APX 200, and Ilford SFX 200, which is an extended-red film, not infrared. I don't believe that the Agfa film is available in the US. Chapter 8, \\"Toning & Handcoloring Prints\\" mentions the effects of selenium, sepia,and brown toning, as well as handcoloring prints, but gives no instructions.<br /><br />Chapter 9, \\"Color Infrared Film\\", explains the characteristics of Kodak Ektachrome color infrared slide film, how it records color, and makes exposure suggestions. Development times and temps are also included for those who process their own color slide film. It should be noted that the film Paduano is discussing has been replaced by Ektachrome CIR, which can be processed in E-6. For more in depth discussion of color IR photography, Steve Begleiter's book \\" The Art of Color Infrared Photography\\" is a good resource.<br /><br />Chapter 10 talks about \\"Digital Infrared Cameras\\". The author mentions 2 black-and-white cameras and one color IR camera, all manufactured by Kodak. These cameras are no longer being made, although you may be able to find them on the secondary market. They were created for the agriculture and art industries, which commonly use IR film to diagnose the health of crops and to detect fraudulent artwork, respectively. But the digital IR cameras did not find a market sufficient to support them.<br /><br />Joseph Paduano's infrared \\"Portfolio\\" is found on pages 38-96, and constitutes the bulk of the book. It includes b&w IR, color IR , and handcolored b&w IR photographs. His handcolored work is by far his best, in my view. There are a useful Glossary of infrared terms and an index after the \\"Portfolio\\".secondary market.

Leonard Wolf may be the world's most revered \\"Dracula\\" scholar. A native of Transylvania who left \\"the land beyond the forest\\" as a child, Wolf has taught and written about Bram Stoker's immortal novel for decades. In 1975, Wolf published \\"The Annotated Dracula\\", which remains to this day the most elaborately annotated edition of the novel.<br /><br />\\"The Annotated Dracula\\" is a large book whose many illustrations and interesting notes are a pleasure to peruse. The text of the novel, itself, is taken from the second printing of the first edition, with typos in tact. The annotations include over 100 illustrations -drawings and photographs. 15 full-page drawings by artist S&auml;tty (Wilfried Podreich) are featured. These are captivating expressionist interpretations of scenes from \\"Dracula\\", not to be missed. All illustrations are black-and-white.<br /><br />In his introduction to \\"The Annotated Dracula\\", Leonard Wolf takes the reader on a tour of the traditions and circumstances from which \\"Dracula\\" eventually emerged at the hand of Bram Stoker. He discusses Gothic Romance literature, the vampire literature that preceded \\"Dracula\\", Eastern European vampire folklore, Vlad \\"Dracula\\" Tepes -the 15th century Wallachian Prince from whom the Count Dracula takes his name, and, finally, the life of the novel's enigmatic author, Bram Stoker.<br /><br />Annotations in the form of margin notes are found on most pages of the novel. Wolf has included explanations for every imaginable allusion in the text, as well as interesting personal comments. The reader gets quite a history lesson just reading the notes. Some of the most intriguing notes include: recipes for the Romanian dishes on which Jonathan Harker dines, population demographics for Transylvania in the late 19th century, translations of old Mr. Swales' dialect, explanations of Victorian figures of speech, and the particulars of Victorian typewriters that Mina employs so frequently. I find that reading straight through the abundant notes is a bit much. Reading them with the novel is distracting. They are ideal for fans and students concentrating on one chapter or passage at a time and add to the enjoyment of the novel when absorbed in small doses.<br /><br />The Appendixes contain some useful information and interesting trivia, as well. Maps of Transylvania, Europe, England & Wales, Whitby, London, and the Zoological Gardens in London are provided, with places from the novel marked. A Calendar of Events charts the events of the novel from May to November 1887 (the supposed year \\"Dracula\\" takes place) in coherent form. Students and aficionados may appreciate \\"Dracula Onstage\\", a chart of Count Dracula's appearances in the novel, with page numbers. There is a Selected Filmography that includes notable Dracula films, 1922-1974, including films featuring the Dracula character, not necessarily based on Stoker's novel. British, American, and Foreign-language editions of \\"Dracula\\" from 1897 to 1973 are listed.

In 1975, Wolf published the first thoroughly annotated edition of the novel, called, appropriately, \\"The Annotated Dracula\\". \\"The Essential Dracula\\" has retained and augmented the thousands of comments and explanations offered in that book, but lacks \\"The Annotated Dracula\\"'s more than 100 illustrations, most notably full-page artwork by the artist S&auml;tty. Instead, the artwork of Christopher Bing introduces each chapter in \\"The Essential Dracula\\". There are also small illustrations scattered throughout, but \\"The Essential Dracula\\"'s illustrations are more decoration than material. Don't be misled by the blurb from Ingram on the back cover that oddly refers to the 1975 edition's \\"100 photos, maps, and drawings\\", not to this edition. Comments on \\"Dracula\\" by 19 writers and artists are an interesting addition between the chapters. Leonard Wolf or his publisher have perfectly chosen a handsome, modern, black and red cover to announce this novel's arrival in the 21st century.<br /><br />Leonard Wolf's copious footnotes provide the reader with an ongoing lesson in social history. He addresses every imaginable allusion in the text, sometimes with short essays. The notes are more elaborate and cover a broader variety of subjects than the footnotes in the Norton Critical Edition of \\"Dracula\\". Some intriguing notes include: recipes for the Romanian dishes on which Jonathan Harker dines, population demographics for Transylvania in the late 19th century, translations of old Mr. Swales' dialect, explanations of Victorian figures of speech, and the particulars of Victorian typewriters that Mina employs so frequently. Leonard Wolf's annotations are blessing to \\"Dracula\\" fans. My only reservation about them is that the notes in \\"The Essential Dracula\\" cannot be easily read. Unlike its predecessor \\"The Annotated Dracula\\", which placed its sizable notes in the margins, \\"The Essential Dracula\\"'s notes are truly footnotes. They are written in a miniscule font at the bottom of the pages. One cannot simply peruse the notes, as I so enjoy with \\"The Annotated Dracula\\". It is too difficult to determine what text is being referenced. So you really do have to read these notes as you read the novel, which I find impractical and not as enjoyable as studying them later.<br /><br />\\"The Essential Dracula\\" offers 3 Appendices. Appendix A is the legendary and entirely superfluous deleted first chapter of \\"Dracula\\", entitled \\"Dracula's Guest\\". Appendix B provides a selected Dracula filmography and a list of notable theatrical dramatizations.

The \\"Food Lover's Companion\\" is a chunky dictionary-style reference of nearly 6,000 food, drink, and culinary terms for the beginning cook to the gourmet chef. Author Sharon Tyler Herbst  has added terms, updated most listings, and expanded the book's excellent Appendix for the 3rd edition. Pronunciation guides are provided for most terms. A mind-boggling array of culinary nouns, proper nouns, verbs and the occasional adjective are defined. As an example, on one page in the \\"B\\" section you will find definitions for: Boursin, bovolo, boxty, boysenberry, braciola, Braeburn apple, brains, braise, bramble, and bran. Terms are listed alphabetically, but it helps to read \\"How to Use This Book\\" in the first pages of the book for specific information on how terms are organized and cross-referenced. The \\"Food Lover's Companion\\" isn't entirely comprehensive; there are a couple of ethnic food terms that I couldn't find, and I don't agree with every definition. But this is the closest to being a comprehensive culinary reference as I have seen.<br /><br />Although 687 pages of \\"Food Lover's Companion\\" are dedicated to defining culinary terms, the Appendix includes many useful charts and definitions, which some cooks will find just as valuable. Some of the Appendix's helpful features are: Ingredient Equivalents  that give comparable amounts for different forms of nearly 200 foods, 37 Ingredient Substitutions, a Pan Substitution Chart that gives volumes for various sizes of pan so that you may find a suitable alternative, high altitude adjustments, oven temperature equivalents for Fahrenheit, celsius, British gas mark, and French gas settings, Smoke Points of Popular Oils, Fatty Acid Profiles of Popular Oils, approximate metric equivalents, metric conversion formulas, definitions of food label terms, a Pasta Glossary that describes 94 different pasta shapes, British and American differences in cooking terms, a list of consumer product information sources for various foods, seasoning suggestions, and an Additive Directory that explains the purpose of various chemical additives.<br /><br />The \\"Food Lover's Companion\\" is a terrific reference for every level of cook. That obscure ingredient in your new Thai recipe and the incomprehensible term in your mother's WWII-era cookbook are both probably in here. It's interesting just to browse, too. The book has a slick paper cover that can be wiped off, but might have been better laminated. If you're wondering what distinguishes the \\"Food Lover's Companion\\" from Sharon Tyler Herbst's \\"Food Lover's Tiptionary\\", this book defines far more terms than the \\"Tiptionary\\", but does not include extensive preparation advice, cooking lessons, or recipes. For example, the \\"A\\" section of the \\"Food Lover's Companion\\" defines over 200 terms in dictionary style.

Food quotes by recognizable names are scattered throughout the book, wherever the subject of the quote is found. There are several charts in the book, such as metric conversion, oven temperature equivalents, and pan sizes. And there is a Recipe Index in the back, for the over 100 short recipes found throughout the book.<br /><br />Every cook could learn something from the \\"Tiptionary\\", but I think beginning or moderately experienced cooks will find it most useful. The subjects, themselves, are pretty basic. \\"Gourmet\\" subjects are few, and ethnic foods not at all. The entries are thorough, though, and would be helpful to an experienced chef if he/she doesn't happen to have experience with a particular food that is included. The emphasis is on instruction in \\"The Food Lover's Tiptionary\\", whereas the author's popular \\"Food Lover's Companion\\" emphasizes definitions. The \\"Food Lover's Companion\\" describes nearly 6,000 culinary terms -ethnic, gourmet, and obscure included.	2004-11-05

This 5th edition includes descriptions and scores for over 1,000 single malt Scotches, about 250 more than the previous edition. It is a handsome volume, well-organized and printed on slick high-quality paper. The book has an attractive, durable cover instead of a dust jacket.<br /><br />The \\"Complete Guide\\"'s first 80 pages are dedicated to educating the reader about whiskies in general and single malt Scotches in particular. Ten chapters discuss a useful variety of topics: trends, origins, definitions of terms used in labeling, the influence of the terrain on flavor, the characteristics of various regions, the significance of age, the woods used in casks, and a list of the companies that own Scotch distilleries, with some explanation of their history. The chapter on Flavours is particularly interesting. Michael Jackson is a good writer. His explanations are clear without being dull, and they will leave few questions in the minds of readers who are new to Scotch whisky.<br /><br />The core of the Guide is the \\"A-Z of Single Malts\\". Michael Jackson explains his scoring system and the components of his tasting notes: colour, nose, body, palate, and finish. Then he launches into descriptions of more than 1,000 Scotches produced by, I believe, over 90 distilleries. A few paragraphs explain a little bit about each distillery's history and unique characteristics. The Producer (owner), Region, District, and Address are listed for each distillery, as well as telephone, e-mail and web site where it is available. I found that the palate and finish descriptions took some getting used to before I was able to reconcile Jackson's description to how the malt really tastes. He has a sensitive palate, which has become, or always was, keen to certain nuances. I'm sure everyone is different in that sense, but I picked up on his meaning after a while. His attempts to describe all aspects of the sensory experience unique to each whisky are most helpful and impressive. It is a pleasure to browse his descriptions. The book's single  imperfection is the absence of pronunciation guides. The pronunciations of some distillery names are mysterious to those unaccustomed to hearing Scottish words.<br /><br />In the last pages of the \\"Complete Guide', Jackson gives us some general information on whiskies from Ireland, the United States, Japan, Asia, and continental Europe. There are also brief descriptions of some vatted malts and Jackson's recommendations for how best to enjoy whisky.l aspects of the sensory experience unique to each whisky are most helpful and impressive.

A few years later, author Leonard Wolf would publish the most elaborately annotated version of \\"Dracula\\". Wolf is one of the world's foremost \\"Dracula\\" scholars, but the novel has touched him more intimately than other academics. \\"A Dream of Dracula\\" is a collection of ruminations on \\"Dracula\\", vampires, blood, and death, often is a stream of conscious style, all connected, directly or loosely, to the 19th century gothic novel whose popularity is set to survive longer than even its vampiric villain did.<br /><br />The book's ten chapters weave in and out of the past and present. Chapter 1, \\"Energy Without Grace\\", gets off to an odd start with spasmodic descriptions of modern psychological and physical phenomena that are figuratively vampiric. Chapter 2, \\"Rampant Energy\\", includes a discussion of the Baron Gilles de Rais, a 15th century contemporary of Vlad \\"Dracula\\" Tepes, French war hero, and serial killer, who had a taste for blood. Chapter 3, \\"Death is the Mother of Beauty\\", talks about the realities  of physical death and the perspectives of dying patients. Chapter 4, \\"Vampires and the Taste of Blood\\", explores folk legends of vampires and blood. Chapter 5, \\"The Gothic Novel and the Sleep of Reason\\", introduces the reader to gothic novels in whose tradition \\"Dracula\\" was composed. Wolf focuses on Matthew G. Lewis' \\"The Monk\\" and John Polidori's  \\"The Vampyre: A Tale\\". Chapter 6, \\"Dracula: The King Vampire\\" recounts an interview with actor Christopher Lee, who played Dracula in 5 films, followed by a lengthy commentary on the novel, itself, including a detailed summary.  Chapter 7, \\"Dracula's Grandchildren\\", is about 20th century literature and plays inspired by \\"Dracula\\". Chapter 8, talks about \\"Dracula\\"'s ancestry: The heroic but bloodthirsty heritage that Count Dracula boasts in the novel. And the life of its creator, Bram Stoker. Chapter 9, \\"The Vampire in my Living Room\\", recount Wolf's sometimes comical efforts to find a real live blood-drinker to interview and his eventual success. Chapter 10, \\"Dracula in Plato's Cave\\", is about Dracula movies, specifically 1922's \\"Nosferatu\\" and 1931's \\"Dracula\\", English version, as well as B-Movie horror flicks.<br /><br />\\"In Search of the Living Dead\\" covers a lot of territory and doesn't always make perfect sense. It doesn't try to be an exhaustive study of any of its subjects. The ideas flow together in Leonard Wolf's mind, part of a thread that emanated from his Transylvanian childhood and Bram Stoker's masterpiece of gothic horror, \\"Dracula\\", and never seems to stop. In some ways the book is very dated. Leonard Wolf was a college professor at UC Berkeley in the 1970s, surrounded by young hippies. But that's part of the fun.

In \\"Creative Photo Printmaking\\", author Theresa Airey attempts to cover 9 different photo and printmaking techniques that are alternative or supplementary to conventional practices, and which will expand any photographer's means of creative expression. I have found that books that discuss a variety of photographic skills, instead of being an exhaustive study of just one, tend to be cursory, serving as an introduction to their subjects more than in-depth guides. That's fine as long as they are solid, accurate introductions. \\"Creative Photo Printmaking\\" isn't one of the better multi-skill books that I've read. Some chapters are reasonably good, while others are, frankly, bad. Organized lists of necessary supplies and equipment are generally absent.<br /><br />\\"Manipulating Polaroids\\" (Chapter 1) is a decent introduction to Polaroid \\"Time Zero\\" (SX-70) film. Advice on manipulating the film is adequate, and there are instructions for modifying modern 600 Series Polaroid cameras to accept SX-70 film. There is an interesting section about sandwiching SX-70 prints by removing the emulsion. The  recommendation to duplicate and enlarge your prints by copying them to slide is outdated. Now you would simply scan them. Oddly, there is advice about printing slides onto Time Zero film with a conventional enlarger, but not with a DayLab, which is more common practice.<br /><br />\\"Infrared Photos\\" (Chapter 2) is about black-and-white infrared film, which is prized for its ability to record increased tonal separation in the midtones while decreasing tonal separation in light and dark tones, creating a \\"luminescence\\" in light skin tones. This is the worst chapter in the book, as it is filled with misinformation. Infrared film does not record heat. Red filters do not allow more IR to pass through them; they block out the rest of the spectrum. Surface veins can be eliminated by increasing exposure. IR negatives should not be dense and difficult to print. The author has drastically overexposed her negatives, something that I would expect of a novice. The book advocates doing a lot of exposure tests to achieve correct exposure. If they didn't help the author, I don't think they'll help you. Set the ISO on your camera to 100. Set the exposure to 1/125 at f/11 on a sunny day. Use any yellow, orange, or light red filter. Pay no attention to filter factors; infrared light passes through the filter. Bracket your exposures by one stop over and under that exposure. Be sure to load and unload film in total darkness. You'll do fine. Ignore everything in this chapter. It's disgraceful.<br /><br />\\"Bleaching and Toning\\" (Chapter 3) introduces several toning techniques. Toning with selenium then bleaching down the skin areas on portraits until a flesh tone is achieved produces a beautiful result on the demonstration print. Another technique is copper split-toning that literally produces a metallic copper effect that is quite striking, but is not explained in detail. There is also brief discussion of color posterization, which produces unreal colors.<br /><br />\\"Working with Liquid Emulsions\\" (Chapter 4) explains the use of both Silverprint and Liquid Light, coating emulsions that are applied to various surfaces in order to make them susceptible to photographic printing. The instructions for coating, developing, bleaching, and troubleshooting Silverprint are quite detailed. Liquid Light requires longer exposures, and its instructions are not as detailed.<br /><br />\\"Image Transfers and Emulsion Lifts\\" (Chapter 5) are two popular Polaroid techniques. Image Transfers are made from peel-apart Polaroid films when the negative is peeled from the substrate and applied to another surface. Instructions are given for paper selection, printing a slide onto the film with a DayLab, Vivitar slide printer, or an enlarger, separating the negative, making the transfer, reducing (bleaching) the print, and troubleshooting. Emulsion lifts remove the gelatin emulsion from the paper backing of a Polaroid print and transfer the emulsion, which is semi-translucent, to another surface. Step-by-step instructions are provided, as well as advice on transferring emulsions to glass, silk, and wood.<br /><br />\\"Polaroid Instant Slide Films\\" (Chapter 6) is dedicated to films that are no longer available, but were when this book was written. Two types of instant slide film, Polapan and Polachrome, are described and examples of photos with various filter combinations are given. Polaroid instant slide films were discontinued because the law enforcement and scientific uses of the film have been usurped by digital, and the fine arts community was not enough to make these films profitable. I admire the films a great deal. If you ever have the opportunity to use them, I recommend the Polachrome for manmade, especially industrial, subjects and the Polapan for architecture or portraits. The author has used them in rural scenes, which show the films off poorly. But the way, Polachrome came in two varieties. The high contrast version was intended to photograph graphics and is less suitable to fine art.<br /><br />\\"Solarization\\" (Chapter 7) discusses the reversal effect (light becomes dark, dark becomes light) that can be achieved by re-exposing a print when it is partially developed. Papers and developers are recommended, and the procedure is described. The author also gives advice on how to copy a solarized negative or slide onto film, but the films she mentions are no longer available.<br /><br />\\"Photo Transfers\\" (Chapter 8) are photocopies of photographs that are transferred to the artists' paper of your choice. This chapter takes you through choosing a suitable print, copying it on a color laser copier, selecting an artists' paper, and making the transfer.<br /><br />\\"Handcoloring Photographs\\" (Chapter 9) provides very little instruction on handcoloring. The author prefers coloring with pencils, which is unusual. Most handcolorists use photo oils in conjunction with pencils for details. This chapter describes a variety of products, but not what to do with them. The author does a lot of handcoloring on artists' papers, not photographic papers, and she discusses methods of dealing with the challenges of applying oils to them.

Emphasis on Portraiture.	\\"The Art of Handpainting Photographs\\" provides detailed instructions for handcoloring black-and-white photographs with Marshall's Photo Oils, which generally impart somewhat muted colors. Colored pencils are often used in conjunction with the oils. Author Cheryl Machat Dorskind briefly mentions other media that can be used in handcoloring photographs, but she does not discuss them. Although there is a chapter on landscapes, Dorskind is primarily a portrait artist, so this book's emphasis is portraiture.<br /><br />Chapter 1, \\"Selecting a Good Photographic Print\\" makes suggestions in how to best photograph for handpainting, including choosing appropriate film and photographic paper. This is the book's weakest chapter. The advice could be confusing to beginning or intermediate photographers. For example, it recommends bracketing exposures, but does not explain that, unless you tell the lab, they will try to print them all the same. And there is not much point in bracketing old chemistry black-and-white film by just one EV anyway. It's better to vary the exposure in printing. The author doesn't mention chromogenic black-and-white film at all, which is less expensive, easier for amateurs to obtain, and would be fine if printed on a fiber-based paper. Dorskind doesn't recommend T-grain films or high speed films, but doesn't explain why. Her suggestion of infrared film is interesting, however, as its characteristic white foliage (when used with a dark red filter) is well-suited to handpainting. A handy chart lists texture, tone and contrast for recommended fiber-based and resin-coated papers. The option of toning prints prior to handcoloring is mentioned, but no instructions are provided. Oddly, I have never seen a book on handcoloring photographs mention digital prints. Most ink jet prints are unsuitable as the ink will run, but I am curious as to how permanent inks and dye-sublimation prints fare. No answer is forthcoming. The information about papers for conventional printing is very good, though.<br /><br />Chapter 2, \\"Materials and the Work Station\\", explains supplies you will need and what conditions provide the best working environment for coloring photographs. Chapter 3 is dedicated to \\"Basic Color Theory\\". There are explanations of the color wheel, complementary colors, hue, value, intensity, color temperature and advice on how best to choose the most appropriate color to convey your intentions.<br /><br />Chapter 4 discusses the five steps involved in \\"Preparing Your Photograph for Color Application\\": Spotting the photograph (retouching spots and scratches), masking the border, making wood/cotton skewers, arranging your color palette, and priming your photograph with Marshall's P.M. Solution.<br /><br />Chapter 5 provides a step-by-step explanation of \\"The Basic Painting Process\\". The example the author uses is a portrait. She explains how to mix colors, paint the photo, and use pencils on top of oil paints. These instructions are very good and would be invaluable if you are handcoloring a portrait, as there are specific suggestions for how to achieve the correct skin tone. Chapter 6, \\"More About Portraiture\\", provides further valuable advice to portraitists by explaining how to best paint red, blond, brown and gray hair. There is also some discussion of painting portrait backgrounds for various effects.<br /><br />Chapter 7, \\"Focusing on the Environment\\" is about handpainting landscapes. The author discusses color, tone, and composition in rural and urban landscapes, but there are no detailed instructions. Chapter 8, \\"Presenting Your Artwork\\" gives advice for how to store, mat, and frame your painted photographs. Chapter 9, \\"Special Assignments\\" mentions some specialized uses of handpainting, such as vintage photographs.

Fantastic & Inspirational Gallery	\\"Handcoloring Photographs\\" concentrates on coloring with Marshall's Photo Oils combined with colored pencils. Author James McKinnis is a professional handcolorist with many commercial clients and uses primarily those materials. This book does not provide as much detailed instruction on how to apply color as some other books on the subject. It does, however, include some useful tips not found in other books. Unfortunately, there is no one book that contains all of the pertinent information on handcoloring. \\"Handcoloring Photographs\\" is divided into two parts: Part One includes instructional chapters on \\"Basic Supplies and Procedures\\". Part Two, \\"A Gallery of Twenty Handcolorists' Work\\", is where the book really excels. The works of a wide variety of fine art handcolorists are featured with short essays about the artists' subject and techniques. These artists use a wider selection of media than are discussed in Part One, including photo retouching dyes, watercolors, pencils, gum-bichromate prints, Polaroid image transfers, and infrared film. There is some really spectacular work in this Gallery. It may be worth purchasing the book just for the ideas and inspiration in Part Two.<br /><br />If you are looking for instruction on handcoloring, these are the contents of Part One: The first chapter, \\"The Photographic Print\\", discusses photographic papers that are suitable for handcoloring. Specific fiber-based and resin-coated papers are recommended. The second chapter, \\"Materials and the Workplace\\", talks about photo oils, pencils, and materials for applying and removing color. There is a brief discussion of coloring with retouching dyes, but McKinnis admits to having little experience with the medium. The third chapter breaks \\"Basic Handcoloring Techniques\\" into three steps: The Wash, Detailing, and Fine-tuning. It takes us through these steps, using one photograph as an example. There is no information on mixing pigments in this chapter. The forth chapter, \\"Ways to Approach Various Subjects\\" offers advice for coloring photographs of people, outdoor scenes, and still lifes. The section on people includes some specific suggestions for how to create correct skin tones, but oddly doesn't give advise on how exactly to mix the oils. The fifth chapter, \\"Special Handcoloring Techniques\\", discusses \\"minimal color\\" and \\"ultracolor\\" techniques. Minimal color involves reducing color intensity with Marshall's Extender, and Ultracolor employs Marshall's Extra-strong colored photo oils for a more opaque appearance.<br /><br />The sixth chapter, \\"Photographic Handpainting\\" addresses a topic that I have not seen covered in other handcoloring books. Although I often see the terms used interchangeably, author James McKinnis makes a clear distinction between \\"handcoloring\\" and \\"handpainting\\" a photograph. \\"Handcoloring\\" uses media that are to some degree transparent, so we see the photograph that has been tinted. McKinnis uses the term \\"handpainting\\" to mean that parts of the photograph \\"are obscured by opaque layers of paint\\", so that we cannot see the photograph underneath. McKinnis finds handpainting best suited to sports photographs and provides quite a few examples. He handpaints with photo oils, applied without rubbing, and artists' oils.<br /><br />In the Appendix, the author gives us his predictions for the future of handcoloring, which he believes has great commercial potential in the fields of portraiture, boudoir, fashion, photo restoration, advertising, and, of course, fine art photography. There is no list of suppliers. I don't think \\"Handcoloring Photographs\\" is the best handcoloring book for a beginner looking for step-by-step instruction, although it makes some valuable contributions in that area. The \\"Gallery of Twenty Handcolorists' Work\\" exhibits some fantastic examples of handcoloring in a variety of media, however, and would be an inspiration to handcolorists of all levels and experience. The twenty artists featured really demonstrate this art form's potential.potential.	2004-10-26

Covers Nearly Every Medium.	\\"Handcoloring Photographs\\" is an excellent introduction to handcoloring for the hobbyist. It covers most methods of handcoloring, including several inexpensive media which may be convenient to start out with. The book's Introduction is followed by 10 instructional chapters. All chapters include information on how to prepare your print and  how to apply (and remove) the color, accompanied by many colorful examples.<br /><br />Chapter 1, \\"Getting Started\\" explains what supplies you will need, how to make cotton-tipped bamboo skewers, set up your workspace, and choose a photograph suitable for coloring. Chapter 2, \\"Toners & Dyes\\", discusses techniques for changing the base color of your print before coloring, including how to mask a print for selective dying/toning. Most people won't want to tone their print before coloring, but this is an interesting  technique if you are trying to emulate antique photographs. Chapter 3, \\"Oil Paints & Pastels\\", discusses this most popular coloring media. Oil paints, oil pastels, and Marshall's photo oils, as well as some other less common oil media, are explained. Chapter 4, \\"Watercolors\\", addresses watercolor paints and other water-soluble media, such as liquid watercolors and water-soluble pencils and crayons. Chapter 5, is dedicated to \\"Colored Pencils\\", one of the easiest handcoloring media to use. Included are product recommendations, instructions for sculpting pencil tips, applying and smoothing the color, and mixing colors. Chapter 6, provides basic information about \\"Other Media\\" you may want to try. Retouching dyes, markers, acrylics, inks, and gouache (poster paint) are defined and examples provided, but there is no detailed information on how to use them. Chapter 7 provides guidelines for \\"Mixing the Media\\", such as how to mix oil and water-based media in the same photograph. Chapter 8 includes useful \\"Handcoloring Tips\\" on how to best approach coloring your photo. Chapter 9, \\"Color Theory\\", discusses the merits of realistic and unrealistic colors and how best to achieve them. It includes instructions on how to mix, lighten, darken, and dull pigments to meet your needs. Chapter 10, \\"Presenting Your Artwork\\", gives advise on how to avoid fading and general deterioration through spray-on finishes, proper storage, cleaning, displaying and protecting your prints.

It is ironic that Cliffs Notes state emphatically that they are to be used as a study guide and not as a substitute for reading the book, when summarizing the plot of Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" is what these Notes do best. The critical commentary barely analyzes the novel's technique and gives no criticism of its content. It would be more useful to someone who hadn't read \\"Dracula\\" than someone who has, but still does a disservice by not telling the reader what there is of substance in the novel or why this Victorian pot-boiler is so imitated and hotly debated more than a century after it was written.<br /><br />The Cliffs Notes have eight sections: A short biography of author Bram Stoker, a plot summary, a list of characters, summaries and critical commentary by chapter, an essay on \\"German Expressionism and the American Horror Film\\", a selected filmography, a list of topics for discussion, and a bibliography. The bulk of the book are the chapter summaries, each of which is followed by commentary by Samuel Umland.<br /><br />There are a few little errors here and there, such as the assertion in the General Plot Summary that Jonathan Harker can \\"barely stave off\\" the female vampires he encounters in Dracula's castle. In fact, he is nearly unconscious and makes no attempt to thwart them. The summary of chapters 2-4 states that everything in Dracula's castle is \\"old and musty\\". Old-fashioned, perhaps. But Dracula is an aristocrat, and his castle is very well-appointed. In the summary of chapters 26-27, the author claims that 6 people converge on the caravan of gypsies. Four people converge; the other two observe through field glasses from afar.<br /><br />In the filmography, the editors have attempted to compile a list of important \\"Dracula\\" films that can easily be obtained by American audiences. They have omitted the Spanish version of 1931's \\"Dracula\\", which is superior to the English version of the film. The Spanish version is available on DVD and is an essential Dracula film, so don't miss it. They have rated John Badham's 1979 film poorly, but it is an important adaptation of the novel nevertheless. Werner Herzog's 1979 film is called \\"Nosferatu\\" in the filmography, which is easily confused with F.W. Murnau's 1922 film. The full English name of Herzog's film is \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\". Note that Francis Coppola's 1992 film \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is also a significant interpretation and essential viewing. It was made after these Cliffs Notes were compiled, so did not make the list.<br /><br />While these Cliffs Notes excel at providing a reminder of the major plot points, they give next to no guidance as to the many contemporary discussions of \\"Dracula\\". The reader is therefore unprepared to say anything of substance about the book, and, even assuming he has read the novel, will not know what aspect of it preoccupies the current academic thinking. Although \\"Dracula\\" has been interpreted as representing just about every doctrine imaginable, the most common discussions these days are of the novel's psychosexual implications, the question of who is villain and who is victim, and the impotence vs helpfulness of science and technology in the face of ancient evils. There is also no mention of \\"Dracula\\"'s famously insufferable prose style. The novel is badly written -to the amusement of some academics and the consternation of others.ss it.

In 1897, Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" was published in Great Britain. It was one of many Gothic horror novels of the day and, although popular, wasn't considered to be meaningful or timeless in any way. Yet, over a century later, the book has never gone out of print. Its title character, Count Dracula, is the quintessential vampire of Western literature and has inspired more movies than any novel. \\"Dracula\\" is sufficiently multi-faceted that writers and directors of film have been able to adapt it for their constantly changing times and purposes. In 1922, F.W. Murnau found in \\"Dracula\\" his Freudian-expressionist masterpiece \\"Nosferatu\\". Nearly a decade later, Dracula was transformed into Bela Lugosi's  suave predatory aristocrat in Tod Browning's 1931 film. In John Badham's 1979 film \\"Dracula\\", the predator is a liberator of sexually oppressed women. In Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", he is a romantic hero. There have been at least 10 major films based directly on Bram Stoker's novel, and about the same number of plays.<br /><br />\\"Dracula\\" is a literary masterpiece by virtue of its influence and perhaps its ideas, many of which are only half-formed in the novel itself. The prose is not masterful. Bram Stoker wrote \\"Dracula\\" as a series of diaries and correspondence which, taken together, tell a remarkable tale of an evil that invades the characters' lives and threatens to prey upon the citizenry of London. Jonathan Harker is a solicitor from Exeter who travels to Transylvania, in Romania, to present a mysterious Count named Dracula with the paperwork involved in his purchase of a home in London. While visiting the Count, Jonathan learns that his host is not quite human and very dangerous, but is left in such an agitated state that he is unsure what was real and what was a nightmare. Hoping to put the ordeal behind him, Jonathan marries his devoted fianc&eacute;e, Mina, as soon as possible and returns to England and normalcy. Meanwhile, a former pupil of Mina's in London, Lucy Westenra, has just accepted a marriage proposal herself. But a strange illness has overtaken Lucy. She inexplicably loses large amounts of blood, her countenance is gradually changing. It will take her aristocratic fianc&eacute;e Arthur, her former suitors, psychiatrist Dr. Seward and wealthy Texan Quincey Morris, as well as an esteemed scientist from Amsterdam, Dr. Van Helsing, to save her from an unnatural fate. Destroying the source of Lucy's transfiguration will take an even greater effort.<br /><br />The use of letters and diaries to tell this story recalls the great 18th century French novel \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" by Choderlos de Laclos. But where de Laclos' novel is one of its century's finest examples of French prose, Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" does not do the same for the English language. \\"Dracula\\" isn't very literate. Of course, it is essentially pulp fiction and had no need to be. \\"Dracula\\"s letters are unnaturally detailed, often recounting long conversations verbatim and in heavily accented English. Not only is that unrealistic, it is unnecessary. \\"Dracula\\" needed a good editor to correct numerous inconsistencies in the text and to eliminate a lot of extraneous material. The novel alternates between sections of tedium and suspense, but the middle section of the book, situated in London, is the most effective page-turner, and Jonathan's experiences in Transylvania are the best at creating suspense. The last third of the book is generally poor. Dracula, himself, is cunning and erudite when we first meet him but little more a primal monster by the end of the story. \\"Dracula\\" is a triumph of substance over style.<br /><br />That \\"Dracula\\", a novel that probably aspired only to entertain middle-class Victorians, is entertaining a century after it was written is a great credit to its author. \\"Dracula\\" is certainly not a polished book. But it continues to enthrall readers, writers and directors, and there is no reason to expect that it will stop. It pits good against evil. It has a fascinating villain. It's infused with psychosexual overtones. Technology and mysticism battle for supremacy, as do Eastern and Western mores. \\"Dracula\\" is food for thought and a lot of fun. And Bram Stoker's concept of the Vampire is so ingrained in popular culture that \\"Dracula\\", the novel that started it all, is essential reading.<br /><br />Some of the Different Editions:<br />All of the editions of \\"Dracula\\" that I mention reproduce the First Edition, published in 1897 by Archbald Constable and Company, London.

It offers no notes on the text at all, but includes an introduction by Leonard Wolf, in which he discusses the history of Gothic horror, the context in which \\"Dracula\\" was written, and some of the films based on the novel. The Oxford World's Classics trade paperback (ISBN 0192833863) includes an excellent Introduction by Maud Ellmann, selected bibliography, short chronology of Bram Stoker's life, and endnotes.

I'll comment on the features of the Norton Critical Edition of \\"Dracula\\", as reviews of the novel can be found elsewhere. The novel, itself, is reproduced from the 1897 British edition that was published by Archbald Constable and Company and is preceded by a short but  useful Preface that discusses the contexts in which \\"Dracula\\" was written and received over a century ago. The text of the novel is amply footnoted. Not only are terms defined, but allusions are explained, and passages of particular interest are treated with some commentary. The footnotes are worthwhile, but easy to ignore if you prefer. I had reservations about the footnotes in the early chapters of the book. Too many of them referred to points later in the story, acting as minor spoilers. I found this stopped after the action moved to England, so it only applies to a small portion of the book. Following the text of the novel are sections on Contexts, Reviews and Reactions, Dramatic and Film Variations, and Criticism.<br /><br />\\"Contexts\\" includes some 19th century source material on vampires, Bram Stoker's working papers for the novel annotated by Christopher Frayling, and \\"Dracula's Guest\\", which was originally to be the novel's opening chapter, before Bram Stoker decided to situate the novel in Transylvania. The working papers are thoroughly uninteresting, and \\"Dracula's Guest\\" is not as chilling as the introduction that replaced it. \\"Reviews and Reactions\\" includes 5 reviews of the novel written shortly after it was published, in 1897 and in 1899, three of which are favorable.<br /><br />\\"Dramatic and Film Variations\\" contains an essay about \\"Dracula\\"'s theatrical adaptations, including a list of major plays, by David J. Skal, who wrote \\"Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of Dracula from Novel to Stage to Screen\\" and is one of this edition's editors. An essay by Gregory Waller discusses Tod Browning's 1931 film \\"Dracula\\". Editor Nina Auerbach gives \\"Dracula\\" a feminist reading in her essay about  the later film adaptations of the novel: the Hammer films of the 1950s and 1960s and John Badham's 1979 film. There is also a list of major film adaptations.<br /><br />\\"Criticism\\" includes 7 essays that represent widely varying interpretations of Bram Stoker's novel, including Oedipal, Marxist, sexual, gender reversal, xenophobic, and homoerotic interpretations. These essays vary in quality a great deal. The best, in my view, are Christopher Craft's \\"Gender and Inversion\\" and Stephen D. Arata's \\"Reverse Colonization\\" essays. But, taken together, all of the essays give insight into \\"Dracula\\"s continuing -in fact, ever-growing- popularity. The novel can be interpreted through virtually any doctrine. There is a chronology of events in Bram Stoker's life at the end of the book.<br /><br />If you plan to purchase a copy of \\"Dracula\\", this Norton Critical Edition provides the most material for your buck and the best footnotes that I've seen in any edition currently in print.the later film adaptations of the novel: the Hammer films of the 1950s and 1960s and John Badham's 1979 film.

There have been 7 editions of this landmark work by Joseph Forshaw and William Cooper that I know of, all of which are out of print. Shopping for a copy of \\"Parrots of the World\\" on the secondary market can be confusing. The book was originally published in 1973 and had 584 pages. Landsdowne Press was the Australian publisher (ISBN 0701800240), and Doubleday was the US publisher (ISBN 0385056281). In 1977, TFH Publications, with the cooperation of Doubleday, published another edition that is distinguished by not having a dust jacket (ISBN 0876669593). The cover artwork is part of the slick, white cover. Ease of locating and identifying the illustrations was improved. A year later, in 1978, TFH further improved upon the book by expanding the indices. The 1978 edition has the same ISBN and cover art as the 1977 edition, but says  \\"Improved 1978 Edition\\" on the cover. A \\"Revised Second Edition\\" with 616 pages came in 1980 (ISBN 0701806907) from Eastview Editions. A \\"Revised Third Edition\\" was published by Avian Publications in 1989 (ISBN 0701828005). The 3rd edition has 672 pages and includes new plates illustrating differences in the plumage of mature and immature birds. Second and third editions were also published in Australia, and perhaps the UK, with different publishers and ISBNs. In 2000, a \\"Limited Edition\\", still with 672 pages, was published by Avian books. All of the editions (not including the foreign editions) have different cover art. All have dust jackets except the 1977 and 1978 editions.<br /><br />I'm reviewing the 1978 edition, with a Double Yellow-Headed Amazon and a Blue-Fronted Amazon on the cover, as that is the one I have right now. The author, Joseph M. Forshaw was an Australian ornithologist specializing in parrots. Illustrator William T. Cooper, was an Australian painter best known for his depictions of birds. The book is organized by Distributions: Pacific, Afro-Asian, and South American, which are further divided into Family, Sub-family, Genus, and Species. Sub-species are found within the listing for the species. This is also how the birds are listed in the table of contents. The book's two indices provide a more efficient method of locating a particular species, however. There is an English Name index and a Scientific Name index. The author has used the common name from the species' nation of origin whenever possible, so some of the names may be unfamiliar. For example, a rose-breasted cockatoo is a \\"galah\\", an umbrella cockatoo a \\"white cockatoo\\",  and what we might call a cherry-headed conure or red-masked parakeet is a \\"red-masked conure\\". I find it simplest to use the scientific name index.<br /><br />The Preface explains how the book is organized. The book's Introduction provides informative explanations of the classification of parrots, their anatomy (including diagrams), and their natural history. Each Distribution is introduced with an explanation of what species lie within that region. Descriptions of the attributes of each Family, Sub-family, and Genus introduce each sub-section of the book. For each species, there is a  physical description, distribution (with map), a list of sub-species (with physical descriptions), followed by General Notes, which encompasses just about anything ornithologists have observed and documented about the species, including calls, nesting habits, and a description of its eggs. This edition of \\"Parrots of the World\\" was researched primarily in the late 1960s. Some information on the distribution and endangerment of parrot species may be outdated. It is also likely that more and better information has since been amassed for the General Notes sections. Still, there is a great deal of information in \\"Parrots of the World\\". It was the first monograph on parrots published in over a century, and it's still overwhelming. Approximately 340 species of parrot, including all extant species, are represented and described. There are 155 full-page illustrations by  William Cooper. Most have more than one bird in the picture so that nearly 500 birds, including divergent sub-species, are illustrated. The illustrations are not as detailed as Roger Tory Peterson's, but they are striking and convincing. Parrot lovers will find \\"Parrots of the World\\" a pleasure to peruse.ooper.

Originally conceived as a means to \\"photographic self-sufficiency\\" -the ability to make photographs completely from scratch, author and photographer Alan Greene has written  an impressive guide to making cameras, lenses, and calotypes that will be invaluable to students of mid-19th century photographic technique and any photographers who would like to discover new ways of seeing and photographing the world around them. The book consists of five chapters: \\"The Film Holder\\", \\"The Camera Body\\", \\"The Lens\\", \\"Calotype Paper Negatives\\", and \\"Salt Prints by Development\\". Each chapter provides detailed step-by-step instructions on how to make these items, along with lists of the tools and materials needed, and some historical background. Instructions are accompanied by detailed diagrams where appropriate and sometimes by photographs illustrating the procedure. Most of the necessary materials may be found at hardware and art supply stores, although you will have to get some chemicals, lens elements and a contact printing frame elsewhere. There is a list of sources for supplies in the back of the book, as well as a bibliography that may interest photographic historians, and an index.<br /><br />Chapter 1, \\"The Film Holder\\", is dedicated to making film holders and focusing screens. Instructions are given for two sizes, one that is intended for wet paper negatives and one for dry negatives. You may choose to make the holders in a different size, however. Supplementary measurements are provided for those wishing to construct a film holder for use in a modern 8x10 view camera, so you won't have to do the conversions yourself.<br /><br />Chapter 2, \\"The Camera Body\\", is dedicated to making two types of cameras: a sliding box camera for use with wet or dry negatives and a collapsible folding camera for use with dry negatives only. (The collapsible camera is meant to be portable, and wet negatives aren't ideal for hauling around, as they don't stay wet for long.)<br /><br />Chapter 3, \\"The Lens\\", is dedicated to making 4 types of lenses: the singlet (landscape lens), the symmetrical duplet (periscopic lens), the asymmetrical duplet (portrait lens), and the symmetrical triplet. These lenses may be used with a modern view camera by substituting the appropriate lens board. Instructions for making lens boards for both cameras from the previous chapter are provided. This chapter also does a nice job of explaining the basics of simple, combined, and compound lenses and the properties of lenses in general: focal length, angle of view, circle of illumination, aperture, transmittance, and various types of aberration.<br /><br />Chapter 4, \\"Calotype Paper Negatives\\", is dedicated to 2 types of paper negatives: wet-paper process and waxed-paper process. Wet-paper is considered most appropriate for portraiture because the negatives must be used quickly after sensitizing, before they dry out. Waxed-paper requires longer exposures but is dry and need not be used quickly. These negatives are suited to landscape, architecture, and anything that requires time to locate. There are lists of recommended papers for both processes. Step-by-step instructions take the reader through Iodizing, Sensitizing, Exposing, Developing, and Waxing the negatives. You can choose from several recipes for Iodizing and Sensitizing solutions.<br /><br />Chapter 5, \\"Salt Prints by Development\\", is dedicated to making prints. The author has chosen to give instructions for making prints \\"by development\\", which is a combined chemical and sunlight procedure, because those prints are faster, less expensive, offer more contrast control, and are more stable than prints made with sunlight alone. There is a list of recommended papers. Instructions are given for both Immersion and Floatation Starch-sizing procedures, Salting, Sensitizing, Exposing, and Developing the print. Greene has also included instructions for The Serum Process, which uses whey instead of salt, including directions for how to make the whey from milk.<br /><br />\\"Primitive Photography: A Guide to Making Cameras, Lenses, and Calotypes\\" is a terrific manual for mid-19th century printing processes. I love the digital darkroom, but I find the basics of image capture and camera construction fascinating. To say that building the equipment in this book or making calotypes is a lot of trouble would be an understatement. But being so directly involved in creating an image on paper has an appeal, at least from time-to-time, that pressing a shutter button on an impressive piece of 21st century technology does not. \\"Primitive Photography\\" provides some interesting alternative ways to see the world and to capture it.ions for how to make the whey from milk. <br /> <br />\\"Primitive Photography: A Guide to Making Cameras, Lenses, and Calotypes\\" is a terrific manual for mid-19th century printing processes.

In 1988, Mark Bittner took a job as a housekeeper for an elderly woman in a building on San Francisco's famed Telegraph Hill. It offered a rent-free studio apartment, which was a real improvement for Bittner, a failed musician and occasional odd-jobber, who had recently been homeless. Little did he know at the time that the colorful noisy flock of birds outside his window would give his life purpose and allow him to find the perspective that he had sought through religion and philosophy. Like so many of us, he caught the bird-watching bug from observing his avian neighbors through his window. He felt compelled to learn about them, began to feed them, and embarked on the slow process of earning their trust. Unlike most of us, Mark Bittner's neighborhood birds were a flock of wild parrots, mostly cherry-headed conures. Some had been pets. Some were born in the wilds of San Francisco. They now all lived free in the city, eating from the trees in a nearby garden and from scattered bird feeders, and nesting in the local parks. Bittner set out to get to know these birds, with the hope of finding an avian friend who could remain free, yet enjoy his company. An odd goal perhaps, but, in interacting with the flock, Bittner got to know quite a few of the individual birds. Over the course of six years, he came to admire the standoffish but regal blue-crowned conure that he called Conner. He tried to save the lives of several juveniles who fell victim to a virus. He became too involved in flock politics. \\"The Parrots of Telegraph Hill\\" is a unique memoir of a man's relationship with a flock of parrots. Mark Bittner wasn't an avian expert and had to learn as he went along. He has an aimless personality that some readers may find annoying. But he's candid in recounting his failures, successes, and feelings about the birds. \\"The Parrots of Telegraph Hill\\" is  an honest tale of love and self-discovery. Even if you don't find the author interesting, the birds are fascinating, and their behavior is described in detail.

In 1996, James Marcus became Amazon.com's employee #55. He successfully navigated Amazon's unconventional interview process to become an editor at what was then a start-up, the first real store on the World Wide Web, that had almost absurdly grand ambitions: to become a successful purveyor of almost everything, products and information in every way, shape, and form. In many ways, Marcus was a fish out of water at Amazon. He was a writer in a company of techies. He wrote reviews, copy, interviews, and, for a while, was given free reign over the home page. This gave Marcus a perspective on Amazonian culture that might be different than that of more technically oriented employees who lived through the same years with the company. He doesn't talk about technological innovation, but about company culture and the individuals who created it. Perhaps his literary bent made him cynical of Amazon's Culture of Metrics or inclined to find humor where others might not. But an insider who is at once an outsider makes an interesting chronicler of history. This is his account of 5 years in the editorial department at Amazon.com, whose identity, itself, was constantly in flux, changing as e-commerce changed, as Amazon grew, as Amazon shifted its marketing strategy...several times. He lived through Get Big Fast, subsequent shrink (layoffs), the rise of the Customer Review, Ambot, and an absurd number of meetings. Like so many employees, he saw Amazon stock reach incredible heights before he could sell, achieving paper millionaire status. Then he watched it fall to unfortunate depths before he was fully vested. The picture he paints of Amazon is of a company that thrives on change and growth, sometimes with a peculiar disregard for reason, and that is obsessed with numbers -and I don't mean dollars.

Seven of the stories feature the indomitable Continental Op: \\"House Dick\\", \\"Night Shots\\", \\"Zig Zags of Treachery\\", \\"Death on Pine Street\\", \\"Tom, Dick, or Harry\\", \\"One Hour\\", and \\"Who Killed Bob Teal\\". \\"Zig Zags of Treachery\\", about the apparent suicide of a prominent San Francisco surgeon, is superb, perhaps the best story in this collection. The Continental Op is a character rooted in realism whom Hammett based on a fellow detective from his days at Pinkerton Detective Agency, Jimmy Wright, and on himself. Hammett's second most famous detective, Sam Spade, hero of his novel \\"The Maltese Falcon\\", is featured in 3 stories: \\"A Man Called Spade\\", \\"Too Many Have Lived\\", and \\"They can only Hang You Once\\". These are the only short stories Hammett wrote about Spade, who was in some ways the flip side of the Continental Op. At first glance, the two detectives have more in common that not, but where the Op represents the way detectives of the era really were, Sam Spade represents the way they wanted to be.<br /><br />The stories in this anthology demonstrate the variety of writing techniques that Hammett applied to hard-boiled detective fiction. \\"His Brother's Keeper\\" and \\"A Man Named Thin\\" feature first-person narration, but are otherwise divergent in style. \\"A Man Named  Thin\\" is narrated by a poet who is a reluctant detective. I can't say that I like the ornate prose style, but it suits the narrator. \\"The Second-Story Angel\\" shows that Hammett wasn't above making fun of himself. The last story in this collection is the first ten chapters of a story that Hammett wrote in 1930 and never finished. The editors have called it \\"The First Thin Man\\". Hammett apparently intended the story to be called \\"The Thin Man\\", but by the time that novel was published in 1934, he had reworked it entirely. The only resemblance this story bares to the later novel is that one of characters is named \\"Wynant\\". \\"The First Thin Man\\" is interesting, though. It introduces a new detective, John Guild of the Associated Detective Bureau, Inc. Guild's manner is smoother than than Hammett's earlier detectives. The story is pretty good; it's a shame it wasn't completed. Hammett may have intended to make a novel out of it, but it lends itself well to a novella, which would have taken little further work.<br /><br />\\"Nightmare Town\\" offers a broad selection of Dashiell Hammett's short stories, representing a variety of narrative techniques. All but one (\\"A Man Named Thin\\") are from the hard-boiled school of detective fiction, which Hammett invented and perhaps perfected. Hammett biographer William F. Nolan has written an informative introduction to the book. So this is an excellent collection for Hammett fans and and a good introduction for newcomers as well. If you have other Hammett short story collections and are wondering what might be repeated in this one: Nothing from the two Vintage Crime collections, \\"The Continental Op\\" and \\"The Big Knockover\\", is found in \\"Nightmare Town\\".

US	44189182	R12XVSXLEJ6TJF	1931082006	557564899	1: Dashiell Hammett: Crime Stories and Other Writings (Library of America)	Books	5	46	46	N	N	Large Collection of Hammett Stories in One Enduring Volume.	\\"Crime Stories and Other Writings\\" contains 24 short stories and 3 additional selections, arranged chronologically, which Dashiell Hammett wrote between 1923 and 1934. The stories all first appeared in pulp fiction magazines and span all but one year of the master of detective fiction's career. \\"Crime Stories\\" offers three stories which cannot be found in any other volume currently in print: \\"Arson Plus\\" and \\"Slippery Finger\\", which were first published in \\"Black Mask\\" magazine under the pseudonym Peter Collinson, and \\"Creeping Siamese\\". These stories all feature the Continental Op detective, an always nameless, stubbornly practical character whom Hammett based on a fellow detective from his days at Pinkerton Detective Agency, Jimmy Wright, and on himself. Nineteen of this book's stories feature the Continental Op, making it the largest collection of Op stories available. Among the best of these are \\"Zig Zags of Treachery\\", \\"The House on Turk Street\\", \\"The Whosis Kid\\", and \\"The Big Knockover\\". \\"The Girl with the Silver Eyes\\" is a follow-up to \\"The House on Turk Street\\", so be sure to read \\"Turk Street\\" first. \\"The Big Knockover\\" and \\"$106,000 Blood Money\\" were originally a two-parter, but were published as a single novella in 1943. As their styles differ somewhat, the stories are more successful when separated, as they are here. The story called \\"Women, Politics and Murder\\" in this volume has been called \\"Death on Pine Street\\" in other volumes; they're the same story. It's interesting to note that \\"Fly Paper\\" was inspired by two real cases of murder that employed the same peculiar method. Among the five stories that do not feature the Continental Op is the novella \\"Woman in the Dark\\". It's mediocre, but has often been published as a stand-alone volume.<br /><br />The three \\"Other Writings\\" to which the book's title refers are: \\"The Thin Man: An Early Typescript\\", \\"From the Memoirs of a Private Detective\\", and  \\"Suggestions to Detective Story Writers\\". The early version of \\"The Thin Man\\" was written in 1930, four years before the final product was to be published and bears only the most superficial resemblance to the now-famous sleuthing of Nick and Nora Charles. It's a good story that introduces a new detective, John Guild of the Associated Detective Bureau. That it was never finished is regrettable. \\"From the Memoirs of a Private Detective\\" is 29 short anecdotes and words of wisdom gained from Hammett's experience as a real detective, first published in \\"The Smart Set\\" in 1923. Some of these are very funny. In \\"Suggestions to Detective Story Writers\\", Hammett, frustrated by the abundant inaccuracies in detective fiction written by non-detectives, sets the record straight on 24 common errors. This was first published in \\"The New York Post\\" in 1930 and is  interesting, if out of date at this point. Editor Stephen Marcus has included a Chronology of the important events in Dashiell Hammett's life in the back of the book, as well as explanations of potentially cryptic slang terms and period references in \\"Notes\\", also found in the back.<br /><br />With 24 short stories and 3 additional pieces of writing, \\"Crime Stories and Other Writings\\" is the most comprehensive single volume of Dashiell Hammett's short fiction available. Hats off to the Library of America for publishing 3 stories that are not currently found in any other volume. Unfortunately, you will still have to buy all four collections of Hammett's short stories to get all available stories: this one plus \\"Nightmare Town\\" from Knopf and \\"The Continental Op\\" and \\"The Big Knockover\\" from Vintage Crime. If you don't care to have every story, but would like a sizable sampling that includes some of Hammett's best, \\"Crime Stories and Other Writings\\" is an excellent choice. It contains the largest number of stories, presented in an attractive compact hardback volume and printed on thin acid-free paper, making it far more durable than other collections. This is a nice volume forboth the casually curious and the addicted Dashiell Hammett fan.ly curious and the addicted Dashiell Hammett fan.	2004-08-16

Concise and Readable.	\\"Film Noir\\" is an excellent introduction to film noir theory. Author Andrew Spicer, a professor of film studies, has packed all of the key definitions, elements, and influences on film noir into just over 200 very readable pages. \\"Film Noir\\" is well organized, in the style of a text book. Pictures are few, as are detailed descriptions of plots. The book covers both classic and neo-noir,1940-2000, with about half of the book dedicated to each. The discussion of classic noir includes the definitions and evolution of the style, the conditions of production, themes, narrative strategies, gender roles, and three noir auteurs (Anthony Mann, Robert Siodmark, Fritz Lang). Spicer divides neo-noir into two periods: modernist and post-modern. Modernist refers to the 1967-1976 period when films were characterized by the near-complete collapse of the Hollywood studio system, unprecedented directorial power, and a conspicuous absence of femmes fatales. The post-modern era began in 1981, with studios jumping back into the noir picture and dedicating big budgets and big stars to noirs, betting on commercial success. Most of the films discussed in \\"Film Noir\\" are American, but the book's last chapter is dedicated to British film noir. Appendices (although they are not labeled as such) include excellent lists of American and British film noirs, organized chronologically and grouped by era. There is an index of names and an index of films. \\"Film Noir\\" is academic, but it's a good, concise analysis for anyone who wants analysis but isn't up to heavy-duty film theory that is so often tedious. It's a very readable, useful intro to film noir theory, covering 60 years of American and British noir, with the occasional reference to German and French films as well.	2004-08-11

This isn't a book of film theory, but a guided tour of this deliciously cynical genre that was the unique product of a disintegrating studio system, volatile politics, and simultaneous post-war disillusionment and hubris. \\"Dark City\\" is Muller's attempt to make these films vivid and irresistible for a new audience. In this, he succeeds. Throughout the book, he refers to \\"Dark City\\" as if it were a place to which we might travel to take in the stark scenery and odd inhabitants. By the time I finished this book, I felt as if it is. -A peculiar place born of circumstances long past, that is gloriously preserved in movies.<br /><br />\\"Dark City\\" is divided into eleven chapters, each addressing a sub-genre of film noir. Truthfully, there would be a lot of overlap if you wanted to be strictly accurate in categorizing noirs. But \\"Dark City\\"'s organization is a very effective method of introducing the reader to these films by pointing out common themes. Notice that the chapter titles name figurative places located within Dark City: \\"Welcome to Dark City\\" is about crime dramas, \\"The Precinct\\" about films that feature law enforcement officers, \\"Hate Street\\" about murderous suburbanites, \\"Shamus Flats\\" about private detective films, \\"Vixenville\\" about femmes fatales, in \\"Blind Alley\\" the events of life are beyond human control, \\"The Psych Ward\\" features films that took place in V.A. hospitals, \\"Knockover Square\\" is about heist flicks, \\"Loser's Lane\\"'s characters are sociopaths, \\"Thieves' Highway\\" introduces us to noirs that make use of the nation's new interstate highway system. Each chapter describes 30-40 films, in varying degrees of detail. Some film descriptions are so thorough as to be spoilers, so be warned. Muller doesn't approach every chapter the same way. \\"Shamus Flats\\", for example, discusses the novelists on whose hard-boiled fiction much film noir was based: Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Mickey Spillane. \\"Hate Street\\" talks about some of the actresses who made names for themselves in this sub-genre: Joan Crawford and Barbara Stanwyck. There is also a \\"Poster Gallery\\" that showcases 8 pages of classic noir poster art. And Muller's \\"Afterward\\" is perceptive and interesting. Muller places the demise of classic film noir in 1960, with the culture-shattering debut of Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\", instead of the traditional 1958, with \\"A Touch of Evil\\". I think this makes a lot of sense, and Muller presents a strong case for \\"Psycho\\" being classic noir's demise.<br /><br />\\"Dark City\\" is aimed at the casual fan and noir buff, not the film student. It's very readable, lacks any real discussion of theory, and gives us just enough context to understand where the films' writers and directors were coming from, without more analysis than they might have given themselves. Muller's love for these films is infectious. Reader's are certain to discover some lost cinematic treasures in the pages of \\"Dark City\\", which they will thoroughly enjoy. Definitely recommended to fans of classic noir who are not yet connoisseurs.ion much film noir was based: Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Mickey Spillane. \\"Hate Street\\" talks about some of the actresses who made names for themselves in this sub-genre: Joan Crawford and Barbara Stanwyck.

There are two parallel stories. David is a reclusive post-modern poet living in San Francisco with a cherry-headed conure named Little Wittgenstein. Fern is a graduate student working on her thesis in Ecuador, trying to observe cherry-headed conures in the wild. When David and Little Wittgenstein's differences prove irreconcilable, David ejects the bird to fend for himself in the treetops of San Francisco. Meanwhile, Fern is working on a wildlife preserve in exchange for room and board and trying to stay focused on parrots while growing increasingly disillusioned with her prospects of finding them. Feeling guilty for evicting his avian roommate, David becomes preoccupied with learning about parrots and immerses himself in studying the birds. As chance would have it, he is forced out of his apartment just as Ecuador beckons him.<br /><br />Anyone who has not himself or herself been bitten by the birding bug might find David and Fern's obsessions odd and the idea that people can discover new life and love  through birds eccentric at best. But those of us who have been captivated by the birds outside our windows -or in a pet store- and have gorged ourselves on information about them and developed a great respect for the creatures will recognize David and Fern's preoccupation. \\"Elsewhere in the Land of Parrots\\" takes on a familiar quality for bird lovers. People really do act this way, and one can discover a world of things through birds. Jim Paul's prose isn't masterful, but it's fluid and precise. The book is a pleasant read, and where I otherwise would have been bored by a romance, the birds kept me interested in this one. I think bird lover's will enjoy \\"Elsewhere in the Land of Parrots\\".	2004-08-07

This book seems to be intended for students of business or perhaps budding entrepreneurs. It offers very little analysis, but Spector gives us the facts -or at least some of them- of how the Internet's first store came to be its biggest. This is a Who did What When and Why of Amazon's first five and a half years, 1994-2000. The story starts before that, though. The first three chapters follow Amazon founder and president Jeff Bezos from his youth in Texas, through a successful career in the vicinity of Wall Street, to Seattle, where Amazon would be born. The remaining eight chapters trace Amazon's growth from the Bezos' garage, to makeshift offices and crowded warehouses, to Amazon's current residence in the lovely PacMed Tower, from 4 employees to 7600 on three continents. There is a list of \\"Takeaways\\" at the end of each chapter, which reiterate the chapter's major points and Amazon's strategy during that time. Since Jeff Bezos, et al created new technology as they were building a multi-billion dollar business, \\"Get Big Fast\\" discusses the creation of Amazon's web site and it's features, in addition to logistics, finances, and personalities. Since I spend a lot of time on this web site, I would have liked a more in-depth history of its features, but given that Robert Spector is a business writer and not a software developer, his slant is understandable. More analysis of Amazon's decisions in the context of retail sales would also have been welcome. But the fact that Amazon was a pioneer business model that many hailed as proof positive of the New Economy does make comparisons to other businesses tricky. As I write this, Amazon.com is nearly twice as old as when Robert Spector wrote his book. But much less has changed in the interim years than in the first five. \\"Get Big Fast\\" is a solid primer on Amazon.com's inception and growth, and therefore a foundational piece of e-commerce history.d therefore a foundational piece of e-commerce history.	2004-08-05

This is a nice compact hardback edition of Dashiell Hammett's five novels, which he wrote between 1929 and 1934. A veteran of Pinkerton detective agency in several cities, Hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks, low-lives, and the seedier side of life into hard-boiled, hard-hitting detective stories. This was a time when urban corruption was the rule, and private detectives, journalists, and police officers shared information. Two of these novels, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;The Glass Key&quot; are American classics. Another, &quot;The Thin Man&quot;, inspired one of Hollywood's best-loved movie franchises. Hammett's novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place, laying bare violence, corruption, and pervasive cynicism. But they're not dreary. The sharp prose crackles, and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it, steadfast in their own codes of conduct, their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism. These five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels. &quot;The Thin Man&quot; appeared first in &quot;Redbook&quot;, the others in &quot;Black Mask&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Glass Key&quot; (1931) are flawless. &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; features private detective Sam Spade, a irresistible femme fatale, and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient gold statuette. The last pages of the book are some of the most hard-hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction. And they're brilliant. &quot;The Glass Key&quot; explores political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed American city. Oddly, the detective is the right-hand man of a crime boss. &quot;Red Harvest&quot; (1929) features the adventures of Hammett's most popular detective, the Continental Op, in a town called Personville, or Poisonville to those who know it better. The always unnamed detective for the Continental Detective Agency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare. The novel's opening paragraph deserves to be read several times. &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1934) is an attempt at humor among New York's blue-blooded, cold-blooded upper crust. Hard-boiled humor is interesting in concept. But I find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny, and Hammett's style was in decline at this point. At least his characteristic cynicism wasn't. &quot;The Dain Curse&quot; (1929) is another Continental Op novel. This one is melodramatic, absurd, and not up to Hammett's usual standards. Hammett fans shouldn't miss it, but others may find it pointless. I described the novels in order of descending quality. &quot;Complete Novels&quot; organizes them chronologically.<br /><br /> Five novels is a lot to pack into one book. But &quot;Complete Novels&quot; doesn't resemble a door stop. It's a handy size actually. The print is not too small, but the pages are quite thin. Editor Stanley Marcus, a literary critic and frequent admirer of Hammett's work, has included a Chronology of Hammett's life and several pages of notes on the novels in the back of the book. The chronology is informative and provides all of the apparently significant events in Hammett's life. The notes are mostly definitions of colloquialisms used in the novels, which are useful. The notes also contain an introduction to &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, written by Hammett in 1934, in which he explains the origins of that novel's characters. It's quite interesting. For those who prefer to own these novels separately, Vintage Crime/Black Lizard hs published some handsome trade paperback editions. But if you want hardback and don't mind all five novels in one volume, this is quite a nice book.gency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare.

With &quot;Prime Obsession&quot;, John Derbyshire has written a fascinating account for the general reader of the 150-year quest to prove or disprove the Riemann Hypothesis. In 1859, German mathematician Bernhard Riemann, in a presentation to the Berlin Academy, made an offhand assertion that &quot;All non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part one-half&quot;. If that's Greek to you, it will begin to become clear about half-way through &quot;Prime Obsession&quot;. This assumption, which was unproven and tangental to the objective of Riemann's research at the time, would become no less than a mathematical obsession over the next century and a half. A lot of mathematics has come to be based on the assumption that the hypothesis is true -although some prominent mathematicians doubt that it is. And it has for some time been one of the most challenging and important open problems in mathematics.<br /><br /> John Derbyshire's evident love of his subject and the book's ingenious organization make &quot;Prime Obsession&quot; a great mathematical read. The even-numbered chapters tell the story of Bernhard Riemann's and the strides to prove the Riemann hypothesis since its 1859 debut. The odd-numbered chapters give us the mathematics behind the hypothesis. The first half of the book gives us background in prime number theory. The second half brings us to the Riemann Hypothesis. Derbyshire claims that the book is aimed at readers who perhaps have a little background in calculus. That would describe me, and I didn't zone out until the last mathematical chapter. All math in the book is explained. I don't think you absolutely need to know any calculus to understand it. I, myself, recall very little of my more mathematical days. More important is the patience to follow the explanations. I think the real advantage in having some background in calculus is that you will be more accustomed to thinking in terms of functions and graphs of functions. If the reader finds the math frustrating at some point, he can always skip the odd-numbered chapters and still get the story. If you're a math geek who is unimpressed by narrative, you can skip the even-numbered chapters.<br /><br /> John Derbyshire's love for analytic number theory is infectious and his respect for Bernhard Riemann and the mathematicians who have expanded our understanding of his hypothesis is clear. His meticulousness and good humor continue to the book's appendix, where Derbyshire has included the lyrics to a Riemann Hypothesis song, composed and first performed in 1955, with an explanation of each line. A perplexing hypothesis and interesting detectives. &quot;Prime Obsession&quot; takes a bit of concentration for the lay person to get through, but it switches to narrative every other chapter, so you get a break.

First published in 1499, this mouthful of a book is a long meandering account of one man's dream which discourses on an exhausting catalog of topics on its way to nowhere. &#34;The Rule of Four&#34;'s narrator, Tom Sullivan, whose father was a Renaissance historian specializing in the obscure text, is in his final semester at Princeton University. Among Tom's three roommates is Paul Harris, a man whose preoccupation with the Hypnerotomachia rivals that of obsessed academics three times his age. Paul's senior thesis, four years in the writing, is to be the solution to a centuries-old mystery: Who wrote the Hypnerotomachia, and what does it mean? Paul and Tom have worn themselves out trying to decipher the text, and just when it looks like Paul's conclusions will be incomplete, a long-lost portmaster's diary that may hold vital clues resurfaces. But Paul isn't the only person at Princeton whose mind is set on understanding the puzzle that underlies the Hypnerotomachia. Paul's thesis advisor, Professor Vincent Taft, a old rival of Tom's father, has pursued the question all of his adult life. Richard Curry, an art curator who had once owned the errant diary, wants desperately to comprehend the document, as does graduate student Bill Stein. The race to complete Paul's thesis and uncover the meaning that has eluded scholars for centuries will entangle these four roommates in a web of fierce academic rivalry and murder.<br /><br />&#34;The Rule of Four&#34; is a mystery, not a thriller. It lacks the constant sense of forward motion that is required of a thriller. It does achieve a sense of urgency in its final quarter, but the first three quarters meander. Literally. The characters wander around the Princeton campus. In fact, the story is almost entirely confined to Princeton's campus, which has the advantage of being a finite space that one of the authors knows well. But at times the rituals of Princeton's undergrads contrast awkwardly with the gravity of the mystery. &#34;The Rule of Four&#34;'s narrator and protagonist, Tom Sullivan, is reasonably well-developed. The other characters are not so much developed as described. They are in service to the plot, and half of them are actually extraneous to it, but I don't think their lack of development will bother most mystery-lovers. This is a hybrid mystery/coming of age tale, so as Tom's interpersonal goings-on compete with the mystery for his attentions, they also compete for ours. His coming of age is the less successful of the two themes. It seems a little late and unattractive. But the history of art, politics, and intellectual freedom that Paul and Tom uncover, although entirely fictional, comes together in a thoughtful and affecting tale despite a few clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />&#34;The Rule of Four&#34; is more entertaining than good. But it's not bad, either. It's popular fiction. It lacks Umberto Eco's erudition, character development, and polish -and, thankfully, also his verbosity. It lacks &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34;'s thrills -and its disingenuousness. I can't say if it aspires to any of these things, but I don't think it pretends to them. If you like cloistered mysteries, esoteric texts, and feats of cryptanalysis, you'll enjoy this book. 3 1/2 stars.advantage of being a finite space that one of the authors knows well.

Stunning Examples.	&#34;The Master Photographer's Lith Printing Course&#34; is a beautiful comprehensive guide to  Lith printing. Not to be confused with ultra-contrasty lith film, Lith printing is a technique by which a print is overexposed and then partially developed in Lith developer to produce a print that is colored monochrome. Prints typically have black shadows, colored mid-tones and burned-out highlights. The photographs must be printed on lith or other suitable black-and-white paper, and the colors produced vary according to the paper and technique. Lith prints may also be toned for additional color effects. Lith printing can be done from color negatives, but normally black-and-white negatives are preferable.<br /><br />A photography book should be illustrated with example photographs that the reader can admire and would want to emulate. Author Tim Rudman must agree. &#34;The Master Photographer's Lith Printing Course&#34; contains about 125 example photographs, nicely reproduced, that are inspirational. The book is also very well organized. It starts with an introduction and FAQ. Chapter 1 provides an overview of lith printing which explains what effects lith printing produce, why, and to what subjects it might be suited. Chapter 2 talks about the equipment and materials you will need, including the qualities of each paper and developer that may be used in lith printing. Chapter 3 explains how to make a basic lith print. Chapter 4 goes into more detail about controlling printing and developing for various effects, including dodging, burning, and selective development. Chapter 5 talks about the whys and wherefores of pepper fogging, among other difficulties, and offers solutions. Chapter 6 is a short course in the chemistry behind lith printing, an understanding of which will help you prevent and solve problems. Chapter 7 is about controlling color in prints during development. Chapter 8 discusses toning lith prints, specifically with gold, selenium, and selenium plus gold toners for stunning effects. Chapter 9 talks about redeveloping conventional prints in lith developer. Chapter 10 introduces some &#34;lith look-a-like effects&#34; that can be achieved with sodium-hydroxide enriched developer, split-thiocarbamide toning, and various bleaching techniques. Some of these produce breathtaking results. Everything is generously illustrated. Tips and cautions are displayed in conspicuous colored boxes. The topics covered in each chapter are set out at the beginning of the chapter. The only fault I have with the book is minor: The captions that explain the photographs are quite good, but they are so small as to be difficult to read.<br /><br />It should be noted that Tim Rudman is British, and he uses the British names for lith papers. UK/US/Australian paper equivalents are given in the excellent appendices in the back of the book. Also found in the appendices are: a troubleshooting guide, paper characteristics for 19 papers discussed in the book, a color guide that tells us which papers produce which colors under what circumstances, a paper speed reference table, an f-stop chart for printing, a glossary, and a list of US, UK, and Australian suppliers.<br /><br />Some photographers might like to duplicate the style of lith prints in the digital darkroom. It would certainly be safer. If you're committed the digital darkroom, Tim Rudman's breathtaking prints can still serve as an inspiration. I generally prefer traditional prints for black-and-white photographs, as they convey a depth that is easily distinguished from digital prints when examined closely. And all lith prints will be one-of-a-kind, which could be a source of great pride or great frustration, depending on your mood. In any case, &#34;The Master Photographer's Lith Printing Course&#34; is a comprehensive, easy-to-follow, beautifully illustrated manual of Lith printing.

Several of these stories find the Continental Op out of his usual element in  far-flung or exotic locales. &#34;The King Business&#34; takes place in a fictional Balkan nation of Muravia, of all places, and involves a political coup. &#34;Corkscrew&#34; is so named after an Arizona desert town, complete with cowboys, where the Op has been sent to break up an illegal immigration operation. The Op's adventures with the customary mode of transportation -horses- provides some comic relief. &#34;Dead Yellow Women&#34; takes place in San Francisco's Chinatown, where the mysteries of this immigrant culture prove confusing for the very American detective. I was surprised to see a Hammett detective in these unusual environments, but was entertained to find  that there are thugs and grifters everywhere in Hammett's stories. The Op is never really out of sorts. He may not speak the language, but he's always at home in the criminal underworld.<br /><br />&#34;The Gutting of Couffignal&#34;, &#34;Fly Paper&#34;, &#34;The Scorched Face&#34;, and &#34;The Gatewood Caper&#34; are more conventional Hammett, revolving around the debauchery of lowlifes and the dirty laundry of the wealthy. &#34;The Big Knockover&#34;, after which the book is named, and &#34;$106,000 Blood Money&#34; are a two-parter about a spectacular caper in which an army of 150 crooks hold up an entire San Francisco city block and its aftermath. &#34;Tulip&#34; is the odd story out. It is the beginning of an unfinished novel that Hammett started late in life. It is unlike any work that Hammett published. The story concerns two older men, both educated and literate, both with criminal pasts. One is a writer who is working on a book. The other consciously rejected the literate lifestyle many years before, but is always anxious to tell his own story. It isn't very good. The style is tortuous and difficult to follow, the opposite of Hammett's typical lean, direct prose. &#34;Tulip&#34; appears to be an almost ridiculously overt allegory of the author's inner struggles with the value of words versus actions and the meaning of telling stories.<br /><br />&#34;The Big Knockover&#34; was edited by Dashiell Hammett's longtime companion, the playwright Lillian Hellman, who wrote the introduction to the book in 1965, 5 years after Hammett died. She affectionately describes how they met, their relationship, how he died, and provides some insight into Hammett's personality from someone who knew him well. It's worth reading. &#34;The Big Knockover&#34; is a solid collection of Hammett stories featuring the wry, indomitable Continental Op. Dashiell Hammett was one of the 20th century's best short story writers, and, apart from &#34;Tulip&#34;, which is a curiosity, this is classic Hammett and well worth reading whether you are new to Hammett or already a fan.e literate lifestyle many years before, but is always anxious to tell his own story.

When the Forth Century dawned on the Roman Empire, the Emperors Diocletian and Galerius sought to unify the Empire by actively discouraging Christianity, whose insulting attitudes towards pagan gods and lifestyles smacked of fanaticism and created division. By the end of that century, the Emperor Theodosius had not only outlawed all religions except Christianity, but outlawed all Christian theologies except one and violently persecuted transgressors, also in the cause of unity. \\"When Jesus Became God\\" is the story of those intervening years, when religious politics became the principle instrument of power in the Roman Empire, Christianity rose and fell from fashion repeatedly and emerged a changed faith, and a once-great Empire became two. The story is dominated by the conflict between Arian and Athanasian Christianity, both named for their most vocal 4th Century proponents, two religious men with a mission from Alexandria. Arius was a priest with strong support in the Eastern Empire, whose eloquent advocacy of the idea that Jesus was a prophetic human being who became divine through his own virtue, a true Son of Man, sent to Earth to teach by example, earned him many followers in the West. Athanasius was a Bishop of Alexandria, who thought that any theology that denied that Jesus was God, himself, was anathema, as  only the suffering of God himself could redeem humanity from its sins. It was these two opposing forces which the first Christian Emperor, Constantine, essentially an Athanasian, tried unsuccessfully to reconcile at the Council of Nicaea. His son, the Emperor Constantius II, was an Arian. Constantius' nephew, the Emperor Julian, was pagan. And so it went on, Christianity in one decade and out the next, Arians and \\"orthodox\\" Christians at each other's throats all the while, until the Emperor Theodosius  came to power in 379 and decided to use more force than his predecessors to impose one theology on Rome's citizens: that of the Cappadocian doctrine. The Holy Trinity entered the Christian faith.<br /><br />\\"When Jesus Became God\\" is an enlightening exposition of the theological conflicts and chaos that dominated the late Roman Empire, made Christianity the cultural standard that it has been ever since, and forged  -or at least galvanized- the ideological and religious division between Latin and Eastern Christians. We see these events through the perspective of the Arian and Athanasian rivalry. This isn't a comprehensive look at religious politics in 4th century Rome, but it revolves around two of that century's most influential men, who represented one of Christianity's most significant theological struggles. The author gives Cappadocian doctrine short shrift, summarizing the doctrine's place in history without providing much detail. But,as far as it goes,  \\"When Jesus Became God\\" provides an essential piece of cultural and religious history in a concise, readable form.Holy Trinity entered the Christian faith.     \\"When Jesus Became God\\" is an enlightening exposition of the theological conflicts and chaos that dominated the late Roman Empire, made Christianity the cultural standard that it has been ever since, and forged  -or at least galvanized- the ideological and religious division between Latin and Eastern Christians.

Anup and Manoj Shah have distinguished themselves in the populous field of wildlife photography by producing expressive and beautiful portraits of wild animals that  document the individuals' lives while achieving impressive aesthetic grace. Many of the brothers' photographs are simply unforgettable works of art that I never tire of looking at. &#34;The Circle of Life&#34; is a massive book that contains 235 photographs of wildlife on the African Savannah. About 40 species of mammal are represented, as well as some birds and reptiles. In the most comprehensive photographic essay of wildlife that I have ever seen, the Shah brothers document the lives of the many animals who live and die in this vast African ecosystem that spans much of Kenya and Tanzania. The authors have organized this photographic odyssey by dividing the book into 20 chapters, each showcasing one aspect of life on the Savannah. The early chapters show us the basic elements that create and sustain life. Some example chapters are: &#34;Driven by Wet and  Dry&#34;, &#34;Light and Energy&#34;, and &#34;Shaped by Fire and Elephants&#34;. The book then moves on to the subjects of birth and growing up on the Savannah. &#34;Natural Selection&#34;, &#34;Adaptation and Diversity&#34;, &#34;Peaceful Coexistence&#34;, and &#34;Mother and Offspring&#34;, for example. Then we see the lives of adult animals. Some examples are: &#34;Herds and Social Groups&#34;, &#34;Grazers and Browsers&#34;, and &#34;The Hunters&#34;. And finally these animals die, returning to the earth, and the &#34;circle of life&#34; begins again: &#34;Scavengers and Decomposers&#34;, &#34;Land and Life&#34;. Each chapter begins with an essay written by Anup Shah that explains what that particular facet of life on the Savannah entails and how it fits into the greater life cycle.<br /><br />The photographs in &#34;The Circle of Life&#34; are mostly one-to-a-page, but there are also 2-page spreads and pages containing two photographs. The reproduction quality is good. All photographs have detailed captions. An index in the back of the book allows the reader to locate text and photographs by species or topic. The index is most helpful considering the size of this volume. If you're familiar with the work of Anup and Manoj Shah through &#34;Nature's Best&#34; magazine, most, but not all, of their &#34;Nature's Best&#34; photographs are included in this book. &#34;The Circle of Life&#34; is a record of wildlife on the African Savannah that is impressive in its size, scope, and beauty. Only photographers who spend an extraordinary amount of time in this environment could have captured so much of the lives of so many  species. It's a pleasure to see the results of Anup and Manoj Shah's experience and persistence in one volume. &#34;The Circle of Life&#34; is a fantastic coffee table book for nature photography fans, as well as a great visual resource for anyone studying this ecosystem.uality is good.

In &quot;The Dictionary of Concise Writing&quot;, Robert Hartwell Fiske battles the veritable plague of excessive wordiness that threatens to make muddled mush of the English language. Well, maybe that's hyperbole. And maybe it's too wordy. In any case, in this book's first two chapters, &quot;The Perfectibility of Words&quot; and &quot;The Imperfectibility of People&quot;, Fiske explains how, and hypothesizes as to why, we cloud our speech and writing with so many unnecessary words. The first chapter gives common examples of objectionably wordy sentences organized by part of speech and type of phrase. The second chapter discusses wordiness in business, legalese, journalese, academicspeak and its repercussions. Those chapters are followed by  &quot;The Dictionary of Concise Writing&quot;, whose 357 pages constitute the bulk of this book. The Dictionary lists common wordy phrases, alphabetically, and suggests more concise alternatives for each one. Every wordy phrase is illustrated with an example sentence and an improved version, in which the phrase has been replaced by something better. Fiske isn't claiming that these wordy phrases should never be used -although I gather that he might say that of some, but that we should express these ideas succinctly whenever it will do the job. Truthfully, writers probably don't notice when they use too many words, so we may not think to look for an alternative in this book. I find &quot;The Dictionary of Concise Writing&quot; most valuable as a reminder. Fiske's examples stick with me and make me more conscious of wordiness while I'm writing, especially of common redundant and overwrought phrases. There is a short interview with the author at the end of the book.

In his violent, controversial first novel, Koushun Takami takes us to the Republic of Greater East Asia, a contemporary, fictional, essentially fascist empire that includes Japan and China, but not Korea. Among the stranger forms of abuse under this oppressive regime is the Program, a compulsory game that pits a group of teenagers against one another until there is only one survivor. Ostensibly begun as a sort of tactical experiment, every year the Program destroys 50 junior high school classes of 15-year-olds for no clear purpose. This is the story of one of those classes. 42 students, 21 male, 21 female, are given weapons and confined to an island. There, they must kill each other until there is one winner, or all perish should they refuse.<br /><br />&#34;Battle Royale&#34; is often compared to William Golding's 1954 novel &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34;. The two books are superficially very similar: They both concern a group of youths on a island fighting for their lives. They are both allegories, but of different things. &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34; illustrates the baser instincts that are normally hidden beneath a thin veneer of civilization. It is to some degree a mockery of British society as the author saw it at the time. &#34;Battle Royale&#34; is explicitly anti-fascist, but since it is doesn't have an audience living under fascism, that's not meaningful in itself. The book's fascism seems to be an allegory for the more rigid aspects of Japanese culture and its educational system. It's possible to interpret the book as anti-capitalist, but I've no idea if that was intended. I do think it implicitly criticizes expectations that modern families often have for their children, and I suspect that bourgeois American youth will empathize more with this facet of the book than with those themes which apply more specifically to Japan.<br /><br />I understand why young people like &#34;Battle Royale&#34;. But it wasn't exclusively young people who made the book a bestseller in Japan. It's an entertaining novel with an interesting premise for older folks too. Truthfully, its themes are not as well-executed as &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34;, but &#34;Battle Royale&#34;'s characters, interpersonal relationships, and motivations are more intricately drawn. And this is what makes it a page-turner. The bloodbath isn't so shocking as the idea that gruesome violence is inevitable. We get to know these characters. We witness well-intentioned  people do horrible things. After a while the reader comes to see the hopelessness of the situation and realizes that people really would murder their classmates, even if they had not set out to do so.<br /><br />When I started reading &#34;Battle Royale&#34;, I doubted my ability to keep track of 42 plus characters, all with unfamiliar Japanese names. But I didn't have any trouble at all remembering who was who. Author Koushun Takami deserves a lot of credit for focusing our attention on unique attributes of each character and organizing the book to overcome confusion. The number of students left remaining is announced at the end of each chapter. This helps the reader keep track of what's going on and emphasizes the narrative's -and the Program's- matter-of-fact tone.<br /><br />The only glaring fault that I can find with Takami's writing is the dialogue. The students' dialogue seems awkward and remedial. As I know nothing about the Japanese language, I can't tell if this is bad writing or a problem with the translation. Apart from that, the text is fluid and easy to read. Don't be put off by the book's length. It's a real page-turner. I never at any point tired of reading. I was always anxious to find out who would live or die in the next chapter. Creepy but true. Maintaining the readers' curiosity for over 600 pages is an admirable accomplishment. &#34;Battle Royale&#34; is an impressive first novel.

Originally serialized in &#34;Liberty&#34; magazine in 1933, &#34;Woman in the Dark&#34; barely qualifies as a novella. It's more an extended short story. The book is subtitled &#34;A Novel of Dangerous Romance&#34;, and some critics have suggested that this is Hammett's least cynical work in its view of love. I don't think it is, but it might be his most optimistic portrayal of love for one of his detectives. &#34;Woman in the Dark&#34; is romantic in its own hard-boiled way.<br /><br />A foreign woman, Luise Fischer, trying to leave her domineering lover, takes refuge at the home of a no-nonsense ex-con name Brazil. Her lover and his henchman try to coerce her to return, and Luise and Brazil are forced to flee together when the altercation turns nasty. &#34;Woman in the Dark&#34; really isn't a fully fleshed-out story. It feels like a vignette: Lots of texture. Interesting characters, about whom we learn almost nothing. It's the story of an incident and its aftermath among a small group of people. I enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend it to Hammett fans. But this is Hammett Lite. 3 1/2 stars. The Vintage Crime edition includes an inconsequential introduction by Robert B. Parker.	2004-06-26

New York Times business reporter Alex Berenson has written a book that every investor should read. &quot;The Number&quot; traces the history of Wall Street trends, bubbles, busts, and the accounting fashions that accompanied them from the 1920s to the present day. He explains how the cult of The Number was born, making quarterly earnings reports the last word on any company's health, and how this facilitated the chicanery at Enron, Tyco, and the scandalously large paydays for incompetent corporate executives that have made headlines across the nation in recent years. &quot;The Number&quot;'s primary focus is actually on the evolution of accounting practices over the past 80 years. Berenson asserts that a disintegration of standards and an increase in conflicts of interest in the accounting profession prevent potential and current shareholders from understanding any company's health or its stock's true value. In other words, accounting slight of hand is such that it would take a detective to figure out if a company is making money or losing it. In explaining how and why, &quot;The Number&quot; gives us a fascinating, very readable history of the numbers and the people behind the trends since this nation first went crazy over the stock market in the 1920s. Mr. Berenson definitely has a viewpoint. He is in favor of stricter regulation for the accounting industry, perhaps more than is necessary or practical. But he makes some good points. And &quot;The Number&quot;'s  chronicle of how things are on Wall Street and how they got that way is invaluable for any investor. Alex Berenson's writing is interesting, easy for anyone to understand, and his insights are essential to understanding what quarterly earnings reports do and don't mean, whether they be for big corporations that are the backbone of our economy, or little ones that may make or break your nest egg.	2004-06-24

In &#34;The Kid Stays in the Picture&#34;, legendary movie producer Robert Evans tells the story of his tumultuous but undeniably exciting life. The son of a Harlem dentist, a teenaged playboy, Evans was the man who put women in pants -Evan Piccone pants- before he ever set foot in Hollywood. A chance meeting by the pool at the Beverly Hill Hotel in 1956 made him a hot young actor. 10 years later, the failed actor without even a high school diploma was head of production at Paramount Pictures. Under Evans' reign,  Paramount went from dead last number nine to the top studio in Hollywood, producing some of the 1970s most memorable films: &#34;Rosemary's Baby&#34;, &#34;Chinatown&#34;, and &#34;The Godfather&#34;, and &#34;The Odd Couple&#34;. Then things got bad. Then things got worse. But Robert Evans remains in the picture in Hollywood.<br /><br />Robert Evans' account of his personal and professional up and downs strikes me as an honest one. He certainly doesn't spare himself criticism or hide his faults. He was a good producer and a terrible businessman. He was blessed with extraordinary luck, a lot of talent, and a gambler's lack of discipline. Like most autobiographers, Evans takes this opportunity to blast his enemies and praise his friends. Francis Ford Coppola is on the receiving end of Evans' wrath. Considering that Evans knew everybody who was anybody in Hollywood at one time, and considering the length of this book, I'm surprised he doesn't blast more people. -Well, he does, but not as thoroughly. The only criticism I have of Evans' writing style is that he doesn't include many dates. Evans doesn't tell his life story in chronological order. It reads well and is easy to understand. But trying to place the events in order in one's mind can be difficult. If he mentioned the year every time he changed subjects, it would have been helpful. As he states in the book's preface, &#34;There are three sides to every story: yours...mine...and the truth.&#34; &#34;The Kid Stays in the Picture&#34; is Robert Evans' life as he experienced it. It's entertaining, enlightening, and a must-read for anyone interested in Hollywood of the 1970s.in the Picture&#34; is Robert Evans' life as he experienced it.

If you've ever wondered when a tip is expected or worried that you have embarrassed yourself by leaving too much or too little, the information in this little book will put your mind at ease. Following a brief Introduction and &#34;History of Tipping&#34;, the tipping advice is divided into 9 chapters, each for a different situation in which you will be expected to tip: Dining Out, Transportation, Lodging, Personal Care, House Calls, Weddings & Other Special Events, Casinos & Cruise Ships, Going Abroad, and Off the Beaten Path (which discusses tips for more exotic service providers, such as tattoo artists and lap dancers). Each chapter begins by describing the topic and  &#34;the players&#34;, those service persons whom you will encounter and possibly need to tip. This is followed by an explanation of the job each service provider does for you, accompanied by the appropriate tip. At the end of each chapter, there is a &#34;tipping chart&#34;, which allows you to see whom and how much to tip at a glance. Also included throughout the book are bits of tipping trivia, advice on when not to tip, and ideas for how to plan and organize your tipping expenses. The &#34;Going Abroad&#34; chapter differs from the others in that it is organized by continent, and then by country, and its tipping guidelines are more general in nature. There are tip tables in the back of the book for calculating 15 and 20 per cent gratuities.<br /><br />In consulting several books and web sites for guidance, I've noticed that tipping is often subjective.  Even &#34;experts&#34; don't always agree on what is appropriate. But, all in all, &#34;The Itty Bitty Guide to Tipping&#34; is a useful, well-organized book. It's only 3 1/4 x 5 1/2 inches in size and will easily fit in a briefcase, the corner of a suitcase, or even a handbag. There is one issue, however, that may or may not bother you: The type in this book is dark green on a white background.

I hadn't read any of William Gibson's novels since \\"Neuromancer\\", his first, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that Gibson's prose style has improved immensely. Novice choppiness at some point gave way to \\"Pattern Recognition\\"'s organic, vivid prose. I was  amused to find that the novel's protagonist, Cayce Pollard (pronounced \\"case\\", not \\"casey\\") shares the same name with \\"Neuromancer\\"'s Case. Cayce is a trend-spotter and design consultant whose uncanny gifts for recognizing the up-and-coming before it arrives have made her one of the world's most in-demand marketing consultants. She's in London to look at a new trademark design for a company called Blue Ant, when its President, Hubertus Bigend, makes Cayce a proposition that she somehow cannot refuse.<br /><br />Cayce's personal life has recently become consumed by snippets of mysterious film footage that has surfaced on the internet. There have been 135 pieces of the footage so far. No one knows where it comes from, but the footage has captivated internet users around the world. Thousands congregate in chat rooms and forums to discuss the footage's meaning, its origin, its nature. Cayce is one of those people, and somehow Bigend has found out. He sees the footage as the latest and greatest marketing gimmick. No one knows what it is, yet is has developed a global cult following. Bigend wants that kind of power, and he wants Cayce to find the footage's creator for him. Curiosity gets the better of her, and Cayce sets out to discover the well-guarded secrets behind the footage. Her search will take her to several continents and  prove to be more dangerous and surprising than any footage aficionado would have expected.<br /><br />\\"Pattern Recognition\\"'s themes are thought-provoking but sometimes almost covert. Cayce thinks a lot about pattern recognition and apophenia, \\"the spontaneous perception of connection and meaningfulness in unrelated things\\". These two concepts  create a sort of pattern recognition/pattern hallucination dichotomy that underlies the story. Subtle and not-so-subtle comments on the nature of art are also woven  throughout. Both of these topics are interesting food for thought, presented in an interesting, sometimes insidious, context. They are also frustrating in that the author's own opinions of art and patterns are indiscernible. Gibson seems only to say that these things exist. But do they exist only because we see them? I'm not sure if \\"Pattern Recognition\\" is  asking that question or if Gibson intended to be more clear.<br /><br />\\"Pattern Recognition\\" is the first novel I've read that incorporates e-mail and internet forums into the story. I was surprised at how effective Gibson is in making e-mail seem vital. Anything that exists only on a computer monitor would seem to be best avoided if engaging narrative is the goal. But Gibson manages to make us want to see what's inside Cayce's e-mail as much as she does. Cayce's online relationships have that real-but-je-ne-sais-quoi quality that such relationships really do, and they're as much a part of her life and investigation as those whom she knows corporeally. I was intrigued by the internet's prominent role in a contemporary, not sci-fi, novel and impressed that it wasn't tedious.

Our detective this time is not a professional sleuth, but Ned Beaumont, a sharp, tough, unglamorous, right-hand man to Paul Madvig, a powerful corrupt-as-the-next-guy businessman with political ambitions. Paul intends to win an upcoming city election and marry a Senator's daughter. But only a few weeks before the election, Taylor Henry, the Senator's son and brother of Paul's intended, is found murdered in the street. The police are desperate to solve this high-profile case. The city's various political forces are inclined to use Taylor Henry's death to leverage the upcoming election. Information is power, and whoever knows the identity of the murderer may control the election. Paul Madvig's now-precarious influence appoints Ned Beaumont as special investigator for the District Attorney's Office, and the newly-credentialed Ned sets out to sort out the murder before it sorts out the power structure in this unnamed Depression-era city.<br /><br />&#34;The Glass Key&#34; explores the interdependent cultures of politics, industry, and news media, which combine to thoroughly immerse the city in corruption. As much as I admire Hammett's themes and enjoy his stories, I've never considered the stories, themselves, to be plausible. I wouldn't have much trouble believing that the characters or events described in &#34;The Glass Key&#34; could actually have existed, though. This is the most grounded in realism of any of Hammett's novels, and it's the most tightly written. The novel is evenly paced and, like its protagonist Ned Beaumont, is spare, focused, and direct in its purpose. Despite the story's third-person narration that never reveals anyone's thoughts or emotions, the characters are well-drawn and never flat. Ironically, the narrative's objectivity seems, if anything, to intensify its brutality. By focusing its attention on the personal and professional machinations behind city politics, &#34;The Glass Key&#34; creates an insider's view of power in America, circa 1930. By keeping the identity of the murderer and the outcome of the power plays secret until the very end, Hammett keeps us interested. Although it lacks &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34;'s exotic characters and more ambitious themes, &#34;The Glass Key&#34; is among Hammett's best works, and I believe it's his second-best novel.ss Key&#34; creates an insider's view of power in America, circa 1930.

Peterman" Through Life & the Catalog Business	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The Triumphs &amp; Failures of the Iconic J. Peterman Company.	If you're among the 40 million Americans who discovered an oddly shaped &quot;Owner's Manual&quot; in your mailbox between 1988 and 1999, you'll recognize John Peterman as the man behind the J. Peterman Company, whose often-imitated mail order catalog changed direct marketing forever. If you're not, John Peterman built a mail order apparel business on an archaically styled cowboy duster coat and a catalog that featured drawings, not photographs, of the items for sale, one item to a page, accompanied by long, poetic descriptions, that marketed mood more than specifics. &quot;Peterman Rides Again&quot; is John Peterman's story of the J. Peterman Company, the culture it created for its customers, and the life it created for himself. His account traces the company from its infancy selling dusters in magazine ads, through the beginnings of the mail order catalog that millions of Americans would read like a novel, to the J. Peterman Company's eventual decline in the mid-nineties and it's bankruptcy in 1999. John Peterman's prose is only moderately eloquent, but it's very readable. I found his discussion of various things the J. Peterman Company did right and the marketing, financial, and organizational decisions that were definitely wrong to be the most interesting aspect of the book. That and the details of upstarting a mail order business might interest any budding entrepreneur. For those of us who miss the early years of the J. Peterman &quot;Owner's Manual&quot;, Peterman's account shows us the circumstances behind the bad decisions that I think most customers recognized and lamented at the time. &quot;Peterman Rides Again&quot; is an enlightening read for Mr. Peterman's former customers and anyone in the direct marketing business.	2004-06-02
US	44189182	RJ4WQA1TL5HSR	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	4	81	100	N	N	Controversial Conglomeration of History and Fiction	Dan Brown's &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; is one of those books that come along every once in a while and cause such a flap that even people like myself who wouldn't normally be interested in a book of its genre feel compelled to read it, if for no other reason than to hold an opinion on this cultural phenomenon. The story concerns a frantic race over the course of several days by one American symbologist, Robert Langdon, and a French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, to unravel the motives behind the bizarre murder of the curator of the Louvre museum, a M. Jacques Saurniere, whose body has been found in a most unusual condition accompanied by a mysterious inscription. There is essentially no character development. Our detectives are drawn only superficially. Perhaps that's common in modern mystery novels. I wouldn't know. But &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; isn't a mystery in the conventional sense. It is more akin to a treasure hunt or jigsaw puzzle. The reader knows the identity of the murderer immediately. The mystery is the meaning of the encoded message found near the victim's body. &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; is a fast-paced, edge of your seat, quest to comprehend the seemingly interminable layers of a complex cipher.<br /><br />The meaning of the cipher is where the author Dan Brown treads on very controversial ground. &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; owes its intrigue to a provocative combination of religious history and pure fabrication. You may recognize the book's allusions to Gnostic Christian theology and the machinations of the nascent 4th century Roman Catholic Church as being largely accurate. But you may wonder how much of the further politico-religious mythology that our cipher reveals was simply concocted by the author. Dan Brown didn't make any of it up. But some others before him did. Yes, Gnosticism certainly views Mary Magdalene and the quality of Christ's divinity differently than Pauline Christianity. But all of the stuff about goddess worship and the French Merovignian dynasty being descended from Christ is a 20th century concoction. The Priory of Sion, which the author claims is and was a real organization, has actually been a lot of different organizations that have existed over the course of the past millennium. Its 20th century incarnations have no connection to the Medieval Catholic Order of Sion, which was absorbed by the Jesuit order in the 17th century, or to any other organizations that may have used these names in the interim timeframe. &#34;The Priory Documents&#34;, a product of the modern Priory of Sion, are the source for the mythology presented in &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34;. And they are universally considered to be a hoax of entirely modern origins.<br /><br />&#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; is often accused of being anti-Catholic. It asserts that the Emperor Constantine and the Council of Nicea, which was convened to establish Roman Catholic orthodoxy in 325 AD, picked and chose from among contemporary Christian theology those texts which served its own interests. No kidding. No history book on the subject says differently, so I'm not sure why the outcry. Perhaps it is the book's portrayal of the modern Catholic Church that has angered people. Truthfully, &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; is not so much critical of the Church as it is critical of fanaticism, both Catholic and anti-Catholic. The author is claiming that religious fanaticism, such as that espoused by Opus Dei, makes people susceptible to manipulation by those with unscrupulous agendas.<br /><br />I have to give Dan Brown credit for being able to create the constant sense of forward motion that makes &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; a real page-turner. On the other hand, there is very little actual mystery or story in the book, even less character development, and thoroughly mundane dialogue. The characters, like everything else, exist to showcase the bizarre and controversial  conglomeration of fact and fiction that have made this novel a bestseller.I have to admire a book that gets people to read other books, though. It has inspired me to learn more about the life, times and work of Leonardo Da Vinci. Maybe it will move other readers to investigate the reality of Opus Dei, the Order of Sion, the Knights Templar, Gnosticism, the origins of modern Christianity, and what little is known of alternative early Christian theologies. I hope so. &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34;'s strengths are its edge-of-your-seat pace and its references, in amongst the fiction, to some history of modern thought that readers might not have considered before. The author gets points for writing a book that introduces the reader to a world of subjects that encourage further reading. On the other hand, he loses points for using the &#34;Priory documents&#34; as source material, since they are widely considered to be fraudulent. Dan Brown isn't claiming that they are authentic; his characters are. But perpetuating a hoax isn't a good idea in my view.

True to its title, &#34;The Getaway&#34; tells a story of crooks fleeing a bank job, looking forward to freedom and the good life in Mexico. Doc McCoy is a career criminal, fresh out of a stint in prison. His wife, Carol, is less savvy, but every bit as ruthless. They've just robbed the vault at the Beacon City bank, and now they're on the run. It's not surprising that, in an underworld populated with low-lifes, things don't go exactly as planned.<br /><br />As &#34;The Getaway&#34; progresses, it becomes less credible and more allegorical. By its end, I realized that the story is fundamentally a parable in the guise of a hard-boiled crime story. The characters are all irredeemable, as is fitting the genre. They're vivid. They act as we have come to expect hardened criminals to act in noir fiction. That's entertaining enough...up to a point. But in the end, &#34;The Getaway&#34; left me unsatisfied, because I didn't find the allegory interesting or believable. I felt that the novel got off to a good start, but went in the wrong direction -or perhaps went about exhibiting its themes the wrong way. Thompson takes the easy way out in making his point with implausible plot elements instead of grounding the story in gritty realism. The dialogue and characters are compelling enough to make the &#34;The Getaway&#34; worthwhile, but it should have been better. I give it 3 1/2 stars.	2004-05-26

The &#34;Daily News&#34; debuted in New York City in 1919. It was to be a newspaper for the common man, which meant not especially literate and frequently immigrant. Its currency was images, the more sensational the better. Nothing sold like sex, murder, and mayhem, graphically illustrated. By 1925, the &#34;Daily News&#34; was the best-selling newspaper in the nation. By 1930, twenty-three per cent of its pages were devoted to crime.<br /><br />&#34;New York Noir&#34; is a selection of about 125 images from the &#34;Daily News&#34; archives, taken from the 1920s through the 1950s. Some are sad, some comical, some grotesque. They're an interesting comment on American urban culture of the time. Many of these photos would spark outrage if any newspaper were  to print them today. Their lurid content earned the &#34;Daily News&#34; pointed criticism from many a moralist at the time. But that never hurt business. The style of the photographs had an immistakable influence on cinema and popular culture which continues to this day. The technical limitations that produced starkly flashed foregrounds and pitch-black backgrounds are instantly recognizable in Hollywood films, just as the corruption displayed in the photographs was reflected in popular entertainment. The demeanor of gangsters and thugs -often posed for the photographers- became iconic. Tabloid photojournalists may have wanted only to get the shot that no one else could, but they produced some incredible -and incredibly influential- photographs that have only become more fascinating with time.<br /><br />Luc Sante introduces &#34;New York Noir&#34; with an essay about the history of tabloid journalism. Editor William Hannigan follows with a history of the &#34;Daily News&#34; and its influence on Film Noir. Both of these essays are very readable and worthwhile.

The novel impresses me more strongly as a soap opera in three acts than a detective story. Yes, there is a detective, the always nameless Continental Op. And there is certainly a mystery. There are a lot of mysteries, in fact. But &quot;The Dain Curse&quot; is the most far-fetched of Dashiell Hammett's works that I've read, and the least cynical of his novels. I wouldn't call this book well-written, but it's a page-turner. The plot is so convoluted that the reader is even more anxious than usual to read to the end in order to find out what our detective will make of it. And that's the heart of the novel's problems: We keep reading because we are curious to know how the Op will unravel this messy, incomprehensible case. We don't keep reading because we are interested in the characters, the story, or the language. Those elements are far less intriguing than I have come to expect from Hammett. Perhaps it's because Hammett strayed from the world of gangsters and thugs that he knew best, but &quot;The Dain Curse&quot;'s conglomeration of religious cults, drug addiction, melodrama, and bourgeois murder just isn't credible on any level. The central female character in the book, Gabrielle, is more of a damsel in distress than a femme fatale, and she is rather unattractive, physically and intellectually. There's nothing wrong with these things, in themselves, but they typify &quot;The Dain Curse&quot;'s departure from Dashiell Hammett's traditional themes and style. Unfortunately, if this novel was an experiment, it wasn't a very successful one. But I don't deny that it's entertaining on a certain level. &quot;The Dain Curse&quot; is quite a jigsaw puzzle, even if it isn't a credible one. And it gives the reader an opportunity to see another side of the Continental Op, for better or worse. I don't recommend it to those not already familiar with Hammett's work, though, because it's distinctly atypical.t to those not already familiar with Hammett's work, though, because it's distinctly atypical.	2004-04-16

These stories are not as thematically complex as many of Hammett's novels, but the Op's first person narration renders the characters especially vividly. And his sardonic internal monologues sting like a branding iron, and leave about as strong an impression. Though Hammett's scathing cynicism is better articulated in his novels, &#34;The Continental Op&#34; is an excellent showcase of the elements which have made Hammett's work so popular for over eighty years: blunt talk, economic and very readable prose, femmes fatales, contemptible but colorful criminals, violence, mystery, and a decidedly unglamorous &#34;everyman&#34; protagonist who lives by his own strict code of conduct.<br /><br />Unlike Hammett's novels, this collection of short stories includes an introduction by the book's editor, Steven Marcus. It won't be news to readers who are familiar with Dashiell Hammett's life and works, but readers who are new to Hammett may find the progression of Hammett's career, personal life and politics, discussed in Marcus' essay, interesting and helpful in placing his work in context. &#34;The Continental Op&#34; is an excellent introduction to the writing of Dashiell Hammett, similar to the manner in which the American public discovered his works in &#34;Black Mask&#34; during the 1920s.

So as not to repeat myself and try the patience of those customers who have already read &#34;Longitude&#34;, I will confine my comments to the additional material in the illustrated version. If you haven't read &#34;Longitude&#34;, it's a great little book, and I refer you to reviews by myself and others on that book's page.<br /><br />&#34;The Illustrated Longitude&#34; contains the entire original text of Dava Sobel's book, &#34;Longitude&#34;, along with 178 illustrations provided by William J. H. Andrewes. Mr. Andrewes hosted the Longitude Symposium that inspired Dava Sobel's book and has himself published the annotated proceedings of the Symposium in his book entitled &#34;The Quest for Longitude&#34;. The illustrations in this book consist of portraits of people and  photographs of documents and instruments which are referenced in the text. The documents include maps, journals, pages of books, and official decrees. Nearly every major player in the Longitude drama  is represented with at least one portrait. Most fascinating are the photographs of the time pieces, themselves. I found the illustrations to be only mildly interesting until I got to the discussion of John Harrison's longitude clocks. At this point, I was astonished to see how grand and beautiful H-1 was...and still is, and how small and elegant H-4 is in contrast. I found it difficult to picture Harrison's clocks while reading Dava Sobel's book, and the ability to see them in this illustrated version has left me even more impressed with Mr. Harrison's work. All of Harrison's clocks are represented with large color photographs, and many of the later copies of his works by Larcum Kendall, Thomas Mudge, John Arnold, and Thomas Earnshaw are also pictured. I wish there were more illustrations addressing the workings of Harrison's clocks, but that's probably a subject for another book. I recommend &#34;The Illustrated Longitude&#34; to fans of John Harrison's work and early chronometers who will not have the opportunity to see these incredible instruments in person.tunity to see these incredible instruments in person.	2004-04-02

For centuries, the inability to calculate longitude at sea doomed many a sailing vessel and its cargo. Unable to calculate their exact position, ships would run aground or miss their destinations entirely, leaving their crews to suffer and sometimes parish from starvation, scurvy, or infectious disease. By the 18th century, the lives and monies lost as a result of this inability to  navigate properly had become such an obstacle to commerce and political ambitions that, in 1714, England's Parliament offered an extraordinary sum of money to anyone who could devise a method of reliably calculating longitude at sea. Dava Sobel's &quot;Longitude&quot; is the story of the approximately 60-year race to solve the longitude problem and its hero, a clockmaker from Yorkshire named John Harrison, who invented what we now call the chronometer. Ms. Sobel has written a short, very readable account of the technologies, personalities, and politics surrounding the quest for a solution to the longitude problem and its accompanying prize. The book owes its economy -only 180 pages- to the fact that the author doesn't attempt to place the longitude problem in a greater historical context or to say more than is necessary about the individuals who play a part in the story. &quot;Longitude&quot; concentrates on one story, which is the book's strength as well as a limitation. If the story intrigues you, there is more to be learned elsewhere about navigation at sea, the technology of the chronometer, John Harrison, and all the other grand personalities that inhabit this tale of discovery and the politics of science. But &quot;Longitude&quot; is a brisk, enjoyable account of the invention that solved a centuries-old problem and propelled Great Britain to global dominance.	2004-03-25

Heinrich strives to share the insight into the world of ravens which he gained over the course of nearly a decade of studying and interacting with ravens, both wild and captive, at his Vermont and Maine homes. &quot;Mind of the Raven&quot; isn't confined to the birds' intelligence or consciousness, although chapters on these fascinating and controversial subjects are included. The &quot;mind&quot; of the book's title encompasses all behavior and experience in these birds' lives. Heinrich details innumerable observations and experiments which he conducted on the subjects of raven feeding and educating their young, cooperation, hunting, adoption, dominance, sensory perception, individual recognition, communication, fears, interaction with other animals, caching, deception, play, intelligence, and emotions. Heinrich seems to possess an insatiable -and infectious- curiosity about these magnificent birds, which is demonstrated in his exhausting and endlessly inventive experiments. Heinrich's studies are as controlled and straightforward as possible. And although they sometimes raise more questions than they answer, they never fail to entertain or to impress the reader with the complexity and variety of raven personalities. It's nice to read a book by a scientist who has such an enthusiasm for his field of study, as well as genuine affection for his subjects. &quot;Mind of the Raven&quot; is a very readable broad account of the lives and minds of these large, clever corvids that have so populated human folklore and experience for thousands of years. I recommend it to any bird-lover, and those who have occasion to observe ravens will find Bernd Heinrich's insights especially interesting.	2004-03-23

It's the most inspiring piece of writing about birding that I've ever read. This book would entice anyone to break out the binoculars and head outdoors to meet the avian neighbors. Author Marie Winn, who also writes a nature column for the Wall Street Journal, tells the tale of her birding colleagues, a group of regular bird watchers in New York's Central Park, and their obsession over the course of a few years with a pair of red-tailed hawks' attempts to breed in the midst of America's largest urban jungle. The drama  repeats itself every year as the hawks try to cope with threats from humans and birds alike in order to raise broods of young red-tails in their 5th Avenue nest -ensconced in some of Manhattan's most prestigious real estate, no less. The most incredible part of the story is the rehabilitation of several injured female red-tails, who make their way back to Central Park and annually provide the birdwatchers with a new mystery to solve as to the identity of Pale Male's mate. Interspersed with the adventures of the hawks and hawk-watchers are other stories of bird-watching in the Park, including unusual sightings, some near-disasters with the city's Parks Department, and introductions to some very knowledgeable, and occasionally  colorful, birders. In the last section of the book, entitled &quot;A Wildlife Almanac&quot;, you will find guides to &quot;Birds Through the Year in Central Park&quot;, &quot;Butterflies of Central Park&quot;, &quot;Migrating Hawks Over Central Park&quot;, &quot;A Taste or Two Along the Way&quot; (edible plants), and a map of the park. The guides are written by some of the Park's birding &quot;Regulars&quot; who are experts in those subjects, and contain information on where and when to find the species mentioned. If you live in New York City or are planning an extended visit, you may find this section of the book extremely useful. And to think that when I lived in New York City, it never occurred to me to go bird-watching in Central Park. If I ever return there, I won't make that mistake again. &quot;Red-Tails In Love&quot; is a very readable story of birds who thrive in an urban environment and the humans who are fascinated by them. It's a real page-turner...and a cure for anyone who ever thought birds were boring. The best thing about this book is that makes bird-watching irresistible.book extremely useful.

Written by religious scholar and head of the Transylvania Society of Dracula's American chapter, J. Gordon Melton, &#34;The Vampire Book&#34;  is an impressive attempt at a comprehensive reference work on vampire lore, from the emergence of documented vampire folklore in the 11th century to the present fascination with vampires in literature, film, and our popular culture. This mammoth volume (919 pages) begins with an forward by Martin V. Riccardo of the Vampire Studies network in which he presents an informative overview of the history of vampires in world cultures. Author J. Gordon Melton's preface addresses the important and sometimes perplexing question: What is a vampire? And there is a chronology of important events in vampire history from the year 1047 to 1997.<br /><br />The bulk of &#34;The Vampire Book&#34; is 802 pages of encyclopedia that addresses a wide variety of subjects, in alphabetical order, relevant to vampire culture in literature, film, theater, folklore, history, and gaming. Entries for people include writers, actors, directors, and vampire scholars. As an example, the long entry for &#34;Blood&#34; recounts the significance of blood in ancient Biblical and secular traditions and vampire mythology. &#34;Greece, Vampires in&#34; presents the history of vampire legend in Greece. Each entry is followed by a list of sources. Among novels, films, and authors, only works that are considered significant or pivotal are given a separate entry. For example, the &#34;Blade&#34; comic book serial has its own entry. The 1998 film &#34;Blade&#34; does not, although it is alluded to under some other subjects. There are some black-and-white photographs scattered throughout the book, and there is a 16-page color insert in the center.<br /><br />For those who own the first edition of &#34;The Vampire Book&#34;, this &#34;revamped&#34; edition has 100 additional topics and updates on other entries. The vampire filmography that was included in the first edition became too unwieldy. It has been expanded and is now published as a separate book: &#34;VideoHound's Vampires on Video&#34;.<br /><br />Vampire fanatics and casual fans alike will find the &#34;Vampire Resources&#34; section in the back of the book useful. There are lists of vampire organizations, periodicals, and websites in North America and Europe, including separate lists for &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; fans. Vampire dramas on stage and all &#34;significant&#34; vampire novels from 1897 to 1997 are listed. There is a bibliography of vampire non-fiction and literary criticism. And if the subject you seek isn't where you thought it would be in the encyclopedia, there is a 50-page index to assist you.<br /><br />I'm sure that there will be disagreements on what should or should not have been included in &#34;The Vampire Book&#34;, but this is about as comprehensive as we can expect a reference work covering 1,000 years of vampires in popular culture to be. J. Gordon Melton's research is impressive. His writing is fluid and not as dry as might be expected.

US	44189182	R3OKSJ8DDPG42P	0679722645	951875669	The Maltese Falcon	Books	5	3	3	N	N	One of Hammett's Best. Masterpiece of the Genre.	&#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; is one of Dashiell Hammett's most popular novels and one of his best. It originally appeared in serial form in &#34;Black Mask&#34; magazine, 1929-1930. The stories in Hammett's novels are typically a mite uninteresting and the characters a little underwritten. Readers don't complain, because story and characters were never the point. They are the vehicle for Hammett's delicious hard-boiled language and biting social commentaries. Published in 1930, &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; is a noir masterpiece that offers the best of both worlds. It's full of the blunt talk and pervasive cynicism that typify the genre. But &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; also gives us an intricate story and better-drawn characters than is customary in Hammett's work, and it's his sexiest novel as well.<br /><br />Our detective is Sam Spade, a San Francisco private investigator who, with his partner Miles Archer, owns his own agency. Sam's a man in his thirties who has been around, seen every side of the law, and come away unimpressed. He's hardened; he's practical; he only cares that he come out on top of each case he investigates, and richer than when he started. One day a striking woman walks into his office distraught over her younger sister who has run off with a ne'er-do-well. Sam doesn't believe her story, but he believes her money. He takes the case, and his partner Miles is murdered as a result. To make matters worse, Sam is suspected of murdering the man who was suspected of Miles' murder. So he's left with little choice other than to track down his mysterious client and solve both crimes. Sam's trying to extricate himself from this mess only leads him into an ever-widening web of deceit. A Greek named Joel Cairo, a ruthless international fence named Gutman, and the various identities of Sam's lovely and seductive client are all after something which they will stop at nothing to get. Sam must find out what it is and where it is before the police conveniently pin everything on him.<br /><br />The novel's sinuous story and trio of well-drawn characters elevate &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; from good entertaining noir to just plain good writing. Sam Spade, his client Brigid O'Shaughnessy, and her enemy Joel Cairo are almost three-dimensional characters. Hammett reveals more of their manners and personalities than he usually does for his characters. And I think it's enough. If these characters were completely flushed out, it would take some of the edge off the story. I'm sure that the last thing Dashiell Hammett wanted to do was write a character study.<br /><br />Noir is by its nature cynical, but Hammett's cynicism is more audacious than most. It seems that in every novel he finds a new way to smack the reader in the face. I've often wondered if he developed his stories around that purpose. In any case, it's what I love about Hammett's work, and &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; excels in its cynicism as well as its story. This time the shocker is the book's attitude toward love: Our hero doesn't hesitate to sell someone that he loves down the river out of pride. He admits it, and he admits that he'll regret it....for a while. Money might have made a difference. He admits that too. &#34;What of it?&#34; says Sam. The last chapter of &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; is Dashiell Hammett in full force. I recommend reading it twice.<br /><br />There's no question that if you don't like bold-faced cynicism you won't like Dashiell Hammett's books. If you do like it, Hammett can't be beat. I'm admittedly difficult to please when it comes to fiction, even noir fiction. I nitpick about Hammett's work, which I like, and which any fan of the Unsentimental will like. For all of Hammett's ability to rattle readers by throwing basic moral assumptions back in their faces, and for all of his ability to entertain, his writing is rarely perfect. But &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; is nearly so. It's got sex, violence, story, characters, hard-boiled dialogue (but not as many great one-liners as some other of Hammett's novels), and relentless cynicism. &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; is a brilliant and very readable work of noir fiction that fans of unceremonious detectives won't want to miss. And it's a great American novel that I would recommend to anyone.as some other of Hammett's novels), and relentless cynicism. &#34;The Maltese Falcon&#34; is a brilliant and very readable work of noir fiction that fans of unceremonious detectives won't want to miss.

The material was not entirely original; it first appeared in serial form in &#34;Black Mask&#34; magazine in 1927-1928 under the title &#34;The Cleansing of Poisonville&#34;. Hammett reworked the story into novel form, and &#34;Red Harvest&#34; was published in 1929. This is also the first of Hammett's popular &#34;Continental Op&#34; novels, which feature an unnamed private detective employed by the Continental Detective Agency of San Francisco. &#34;Red Harvest&#34;'s narrator and veteran Continental operative defies any idea of a glamorous or attractive crime fighter. He's short, pot-bellied, alcoholic, and resolutely cynical. He's living in an immoral world, where success comes to those who fight fire with fire. Like all of Hammett's protagonists, he has little use for the law, but lives by a personal code to which he strictly adheres. That doesn't make him especially ethical, only principled. But Hammett's characters, like Hammett himself, are coping in their own way with the widespread corruption that ruled America's cities in the 1920s and 1930s.<br /><br />&#34;Red Harvest&#34;'s opening paragraph is one of the best hooks I've ever read in a novel. It's fantastic. We are sucked into the mind of our narrator, the unnamed Continental operative, and we want only to read more about this man of such blunt wit. The Continental Op has been called to a town named Personville by the owner of the town's newspaper, Donald Willsson. He doesn't know what the job is, but before he can find out, the client is murdered. So the first order of business is to solve the murder. In doing so, our detective discovers how Personville got its nickname, Poisonville. Everything and everyone in this town is corrupt. Its citizens are ruled by bootleggers and low-lifes who retain their power through  indiscriminate violence. Even the town's former boss, Elihu Willsson, a wealthy industrialist who was not above murder in his own day, is now reluctantly under the thumb of the new crop of thugs. Our detective takes offense at Poisonville's powers trying several times to assassinate him in the course of his murder investigation, so he decides to stay and clean up the place. Little did he expect that Poisonville's rampant bloodshed would poison him, as he is seduced by the town's murderous ways.<br /><br />It's surprising to me that Dashiell Hammett wrote &#34;Red Harvest&#34; years before &#34;The Thin Man&#34;. &#34;Red Harvest&#34;'s style seems more developed and its characters better drawn than in the later novel. That's not to say that I don't like &#34;The Thin Man&#34;. I actually prefer its more scandalous brand of cynicism. Hammett is always cynical, but sociopathic behavior is to be expected from the characters that inhabit Personville's landscape. They are criminals and police officers (remember, this is the 1920s). The undeniably sociopathic behavior of everyone in &#34;The Thin Man&#34; -from small time con men, to respectable bourgeois, to Park Avenue blue bloods- is like a slap in the face. And so is the book's shameless lack of justice. But perhaps Hammett  just chose a different  shock tactic in &#34;Red Harvest&#34;. The book's greatest cynicism is in the ease with which the Continental Op is seduced into abandoning his own code of conduct when faced with the opportunity to murder without consequences. That's why they call it Poisonville. Fans of noir detective stories wont' want to miss &#34;Red Harvest&#34;. There are enough hard-boiled one-liners to inspire glee in those who really enjoy them.

Margot Rosenberg and Bern Markowitz wrote &#34;The Care and Feeding of Books Old and New&#34; after repeatedly being queried by their customers on how to care for old books. The couple owned Dog Lovers Bookshop in Manhattan (now on the web), which specialized in the literature of dogs, including many old and esoteric volumes. Inspired by basic handbooks for new dog owners, they set out to write a common sense guide to book ownership that covered routine care and basic first aid. In that, they have largely succeeded. This book would be a useful and much appreciated addition to the collection of any reader who isn't an expert, but  is interested in keeping his or her books in top shape through preventive measures and minor repairs. It's a fantastic help for anyone who frequently purchases secondhand books that would benefit from a little clean-up.<br /><br />The book starts out with an explanation of the common household products, as well as some specialized products, that will be of use to you in maintaining and repairing books. Then the authors talk about conditions which pose a threat to books -mold, insects, water, dirt, etc.- and what you can do to remedy the damage. There is a chapter on cleaning books and a chapter on repairing them. Both chapters address all parts of the book, including dust jackets. Most of the advice is for hardback books, but some of it applies equally to paperbacks. The discussion of book repair includes a section on professional bookbinding in case your book's affliction is beyond the scope of an amateur. There is a lengthy and informative interview with John Landau, owner of Find Binding and expert bibliopegist. The authors go on to recommend the best ways to handle, store and protect books. And this guide to book ownership concludes with some fun ideas on how to promote the good care of books, followed by a glossary of terms, an amusing list of words pertaining to books whose root is &#34;biblio&#34;, recommendations for further reading, a list of suppliers, organizations that offer classes in book arts, and, finally, a little travel guide for those who want to walk &#34;a bibliomaniac's Manhattan mile&#34;.<br /><br />I'm giving &#34;The Care and Feeding of Books Old and New&#34; five stars because it contains so much useful information, presented in a humorous tone at a jaunty pace. I have one reservation about the book, however: It would benefit tremendously from some illustrations. A diagram of a book's &#34;anatomy&#34; with parts labeled would make it so much easier to understand instructions, as would a few additional illustrations of the more complex repairs.

Which type of organization you prefer will depend upon your needs and tastes. If you are looking for a thesaurus that will simply give you the most and best alternative words, an alphabetical thesaurus such as Rodale Press' &quot;Synonym Finder&quot; is easier to use and more efficient to that purpose. On the other hand, &quot;Roget's International Thesaurus&quot; has traded ease of use for versatility. If it's a synonym you seek, look it up in the index, which will direct you to the appropriate section and subsection. There, you will find synonyms for your word, and if you let your eyes wander up and down the page perusing the contents of that section, you will also find words related to your subject, including antonyms. The part of speech for each word is always given, and abbreviations for &quot;nonformal&quot; and the origins of foreign words are provided for clarity. There are no word definitions. Section/subsection numbers are conveniently found at the top of each page to aid in locating words. If you have no idea what word you need, you can consult the list of 1,075 categories in the front of the book, which will direct you to words related to that subject. Word lists are another of the book's useful features. If you are looking at the subject of lakes, for example, you are provided with a list of the world's major lakes. Other examples include a list of words describing different types of engraving found in the graphic arts section, and over 100 types of ceramic are listed in the ceramics section. A short biography of Peter Mark Roget, the 19th century physician whose work was the basis for all subsequent thesauruses organized by subject, introduces you to the book, followed by a short explanation of how to best make use of this thesaurus. I think that most students will prefer an alphabetical thesaurus to this one. But if you do a lot of expository writing, Roget's organization by subject could prove invaluable. Since I do a lot of writing and have somehow deluded myself into viewing shelf space as endlessly expandable, I have found that having both &quot;Roget's International Thesaurus&quot; and &quot;The Synonym Finder&quot; is the best way to go.e.

Much mythologized but little understood, pirates have for centuries been a dangerous fact of life for those living and traveling on the high seas. In &#34;Under the Black Flag&#34;, David Cordingly has written a superb examination of the legends and realities of Pirates and Piracy. He concentrates primarily on pirates of the Western world during The Golden Age of Piracy, which lasted roughly from 1650 to 1725, although there are some notable exceptions made for Chinese and Barbary pirates. Cordingly has included privateers, buccaneers, corsairs , as well as regular old pirates in his study, as they are inherently related. The word &#34;pirate&#34; implies a crime, whereas privateers were licensed by their king to plunder and seize any ship belonging to a &#34;hostile&#34; nation. They were, in effect, legally sanctioned pirates. Buccaneers were pirates who operated in the Caribbean and South America during the 17th century and were descended from French hunters of the region. Corsairs, although addressed only briefly in the book, were pirates of the Mediterranean, most famously the Barbary Coast, who were authorized by their rulers to attack ships from Christian nations.<br /><br />&#34;Under the Black Flag&#34; starts out by examining the mythology of pirates in Western literature and how the perceptions of fictional pirates compared with reality. Then the author moves on to explore the history of real pirates, starting with the quest for Aztec and Inca gold in Central America in the 16th century and moving on to the privateers of the 17th century -most famously Sir Henry Morgan- who plundered Spanish port cities in the Caribbean. There is a chapter on women amongst pirates, featuring the infamous Mary Read and Anne Bonny, who were tried and convicted of piracy in the Caribbean, as well as stories of prominent female pirates in Scandinavia and in China, home to the woman who is sometimes called the greatest pirate of all time, Mrs. Cheng. Cordingly describes the conditions of life at sea for pirates and the significance of the notorious pirate flag. And he  analyzes the use of violence, torture and marooning by pirates on their victims. He  separates fact from fiction in examining the legends of Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and buried treasure. And then Cordingly tells us how and why The Golden Age of Piracy came to an abrupt end in the early 18th century, including the legendary battle in which the infamous Blackbeard was defeated.<br /><br />Typical of David Cordingly's writing style, &#34;Under the Black Flag&#34; starts out in one place -in this case with pirates in popular culture, fans outward to explore the subject in depth, which eventually leads us back to where we started. This approach is extremely effective in emphasizing relationships between all of the topics that are being addressed and in securing the reader's interest for the course of the book. &#34;Under the Black Flag&#34; is an excellent overview of The Golden Age of Piracy, but it isn't exhaustive on all subjects. As always, Mr. Cordingly includes a list of recommended further reading in his acknowledgments, for those who would like to study Piracy in more depth. &#34;Under the Black Flag&#34; is a fascinating, insightful account of the peculiar subculture of piracy and the role it played for centuries in the seafaring life.

I have to give Sir Alec credit: His diary is not as tedious as most people's would be. His writing has a nice pace, and the book is mercifully short. But there simply isn't anything interesting about it. Sir Alec was 82 years old and retired when he wrote this diary. He spent most of his time relaxing at his country home. If he were working, he might have had more interesting anecdotes to relate or perhaps some insight into the process of putting on a play or making a movie to share. But it takes a more talented writer to make something interesting out of the mundane. Sir Alec mentions music that he likes, plays that he sees, books that he reads, art in various forms, but he never expounds on these subjects, so we don't learn anything about the subjects or about him. He doesn't seem to be an opinionated person. Opinions, however trying, might make for better reading. All in all, &quot;My Name Escapes Me&quot; gives the impression of a man of moderate writing talent and moderate intelligence. It's really too bad that no publisher asked Alec Guinness to write a diary for publication earlier in his life. His style is both literate and easy-going. If it had been applied to the life of a working actor, an insightful and highly readable book might have resulted. But as it is, I think only obsessively curious fans of Alec Guinness will find anything of interest in &quot;My Name Escapes Me&quot;.	2004-02-10

The &quot;Random House Word Menu&quot; defines words, but it is not a dictionary. It is arranged by subject, not alphabetically, and lacks word etymology and pronunciation. Unlike a thesaurus, it doesn't provide synonyms or antonyms, but words related by subject. The &quot;Word Menu&quot; is the product of 20 years of research by writer Stephen Glazier, whose diverse career with words includes writing novels, screenplays, copywriting, and editing. It started as lists of words organized by subject for use in writing novels, and it ended up a widely useful reference book featuring 75,000 words. The words are divided into 7 major categories: The Human Body, Living Things, Science and Technology, Domestic Life, Institutions, Arts and Leisure, Language, and The Human Condition. Each category in turn has 3 or 4 subcategories, and there are two more levels of categorization within those, constituting 800 divisions in all. Once you find the subcategory that you want, you are presented with a literal &quot;menu&quot; of words pertaining to the subject along with their definitions. You can find the subcategory you seek by looking at the table of contents, by using the Guide Words that tell you what category and subcategory you are in at the top of each page, or by using the index. All of the words are indexed alphabetically, so if you can think of a word related to what you need, you can locate the appropriate category easily. The &quot;Word Menu&quot; is most useful for finding the correct word when describing a topic in detail and for gaining familiarity with the vocabulary of a particular subject. Because the words have been selected by subject, the &quot;Word Menu&quot; contains far more nouns than adjectives or verbs. I found that the book's organization took a bit of getting used to before I could locate words efficiently. But the &quot;Word Menu&quot; is a unique and  helpful writer's tool that has a place alongside my dictionary and thesaurus.	2004-02-08

The authors, Raymond McNally and Radu Florescu, both history professors at Boston College, undertook seven research expeditions to investigate their hypothesis that the infamous vampire Count was in part based on a real person: the 15th century Eastern European ruler Vlad Tepes, Prince of Wallachia, otherwise known as Vlad the Impaler. Vlad Tepes' father was Vlad Dracul, who ruled Wallachia before him, and Tepes preferred the name &#34;Dracula&#34;, by which he was widely known in his own time. Bram Stoker's Count Dracula appears to have been inspired by stories of Vlad the Impaler along with the vampire folklore of the region that the historical Dracula dominated. Vlad the Impaler has never been considered a vampire by his countrymen, and similarities to the fictional Count are superficial, but they are enough to indicate more than coincidence: The two men have the same name. Count Dracula is from Transylvania, while Prince Dracula was from neighboring Wallachia, but his castle was on the Transylvanian border. Both men led their nations to victory against the incurring Ottoman Turks. And both were widely feared. Vlad the Impaler was and still is considered to be one of the most bloodthirsty and Machiavellian leaders to have ever lived, having murdered an estimated one fifth of his own population. Legend has it that the ruthless Prince ate bread dipped in the blood of his victims. That's not substantiable, but it may provide a further connection to Bram Stoker's fictional Count. Count Dracula and Vlad Tepes have nothing in common beyond these few traits, and the horrific truth of Vlad Tepes' rule in the mid- to late- 15th century is far more frightening than any gothic horror novel, but not nearly as seductively allegorical.<br /><br />The first approximately hundred pages of &#34;In Search of Dracula&#34; are about about the life of Vlad Tepes, or Prince Dracula, Count Dracula's historical namesake. This history is not scholarly enough for my taste. But it serves well as an introduction to the subjects of the Ottoman incursions into Europe, Eastern European politics in the 15th century, and the life of the infamous Vlad the Impaler. It has inspired me to delve further into these subjects. The book also includes chapters on Bram Stoker and on Dracula's incarnations in fiction and film. Ironically, although the authors' case for how and why Vlad Tepes was an inspiration for Count Dracula is reasonably strong, I felt that it was stated weakly. And readers would very much benefit from a good map during the discussions of conflicts with the Turks, but the book offers only two small and extremely poor maps. I would be inclined to give &#34;In Search of Dracula&#34; 3 stars if not for its Appendixes, which include translations of old German, Russian, and Romanian stories about Vlad Tepes as well as a comprehensive vampire filmography up until 1992. I found the filmography very useful.

Seafaring life in the 18th and 19th centuries has fascinated modern history enthusiasts  and captured the imaginations of novelists and filmmakers. In &#34;Women Sailors and Sailors' Women&#34;, author David Cordingly explores an aspect of lives spent at sea that has traditionally received little attention: the women who directly or indirectly participated in the  maritime lifestyle. What is often thought of as a very male culture was populated with women as well. So who were they? In answering this question, David Cordingly starts in port and takes us on a journey out to sea and back again, discussing the diverse roles of women in the sailors' lives, on land and at sea. These women were the wives, mistresses, and prostitutes of sailors, and some were sailors themselves.<br /><br />The book starts in port with the relationship of prostitutes to sailors, who these women were, and how they came to be. Then we go out to sea with women who disguised themselves as men and served alongside them, including the two infamous female pirates, Anne Bonny and Mary Read. We learn that warrant officers' wives were commonly allowed on warships and captains' wives may have been equally common residents on merchant ships. Both of these circumstances led to some interesting stories, including the origin of the term &#34;son of a gun&#34; and the heroic tale of Mary Patten, who captained her husband's ship around Cape Horn during a violent storm in 1856, saving its cargo and becoming an American hero. Cordingly takes a chapter to address the concept of mermaids and the mythical relationships between women and water. And he explores the legend of the stereotypical sailor who has &#34;a wife in every port&#34;.<br /><br />There is a chapter on women lighthouse keepers and their daring rescues. And finally, the book returns to port and to the sailors' wives who await their husbands' return. We learn what they have been doing and how they have fared without their husband's wages. &#34;Women Sailors and Sailors' Women&#34; is recommended reading for anyone interested in the history of maritime culture. It fills in some gaps in the sailors' lives and reminds us that many women witnessed and participated in great naval battles as well as the constant battle with nature at sea. Because a global survey would be too vast, David Cordingly has confined his study to Anglo-American maritime culture in the 18th and 19th century. &#34;Women Sailors and Sailors' Women&#34; is a fairly quick-paced, engaging read, and full of fascinating facts and characters that will entertain anyone with even a passing interest in the subject.ors' Women&#34; is recommended reading for anyone interested in the history of maritime culture.

The first thing that anyone will notice upon opening &quot;The Snowflake&quot; is Patricia Rasmussen's incredible photographs. I am something of a snowflake enthusiast, and I have never seen such stunning photographs of snow before. There are over 100 exquisitely detailed photographs of snow crystals and snowflakes that will take your breath away. Fans of  &quot;The Snowflake Man&quot;, W. A. Bentley, will love this book. But it isn't just pretty pictures. The photographs illustrate a text by physicist Kenneth Libbrecht. Dr. Libbrecht is a snow crystal researcher, and his fluid prose successfully communicates the depth of knowledge and enthusiasm he has for his subject. &quot;The Snowflake&quot; has eight chapters, all of which are generously illustrated with photographs and most of which are short. The first seven chapters explain how and why snow crystals form the way they do, as well as the history of our understanding of snow. Libbrecht's text is detailed and technical, but it is very readable and easily understood by a lay person. And he moves onto the next topic before you have a chance to become bored by the particulars of the last. Chapter 8, which is by far the longest chapter at 32 pages, is a &quot;Field Guide to Falling Snow&quot;. All types of snow crystal, both common and rare, are described and pictured so that the reader will be able to identify just about anything he/she might encounter falling from the winter sky. &quot;The Snowflake&quot; is a thoroughly enjoyable and genuinely inspiring book. Patricia Rasmussen's photographs are a testament to the extraordinary beauty that can be found is such a small natural wonder as a snowflake. And Kenneth Libbrecht's writing is sure to inspire many of his readers to abandon their cozy living rooms and head outside with a magnifying glass the next time it snows. I think that Dr. Libbrecht succeeds in the seemingly absurd task of making us understand why snow crystals are so fascinating that a person might dedicate his professional life to understanding them. &quot;The Snowflake&quot; is a great winter read, a lovely &quot;coffee table&quot; book, an informative scientific text for enthusiasts of all ages, and it might even cheer you up during the next snow storm. If your car is stuck, your walk needs shoveling, and you are tired of all that white stuff, a chapter of &quot;The Snowflake&quot; and an inexpensive magnifying glass will surely put things in a better light. Fans and practitioners of macro photography will also find this book irresistible.icate his professional life to understanding them. &quot;The Snowflake&quot; is a great winter read, a lovely &quot;coffee table&quot; book, an informative scientific text for enthusiasts of all ages, and it might even cheer you up during the next snow storm.

From this standpoint, I would say that the first 3 chapters of  &#34;Amazon Hacks&#34; don't provide any understanding of the Search, Community features, or Account information that someone who has been around a while would not already have. In fact, the book's information on Amazon Community features isn't comprehensive. On the other hand, there are hacks for getting additional utility out of Amazon such as: configuring Internet Explorer to search Amazon from its address bar or any web page, adding an Amazon sidebar to Mozilla, prioritizing your wish list using a third-party service, sorting recommendations and items by average rating, finding a purchase circle by zip code, tracking the sales ranks of items over time, and how to perform a lot of tasks remotely.<br /><br />I am not a programmer or an Amazon Associate, so I am not in the best position to judge the helpfulness of Chapters 4-6.

After years of admiring Troy Paiva's photography on his website, I was thrilled to find that a collection of his unique images is finally available in print. For those unfamiliar with Paiva's work, he takes color pictures of long-abandoned buildings and machines at night, under moonlight, and provides additional illumination with splashes of brightly colored flash. If that sounds gaudy or just plain odd, it probably is. And although I'm normally a fan of subdued colors and black-and-white photography, Troy Paiva's work has always captivated me. A lot of photographers take pictures of decay. And taken under sunlight by any other photographer, that's what these images would look like. But decay is only part of the story. Troy Paiva had a stroke of genius when he determined that darkness and garish color would turn his images of junk into vital accounts of American technologies and ideas whose life cycle has been spent. His lighting techniques make the structures seem haunted. Not by ghosts, but by cultures long departed. Ugly things are made eerily riveting, if not actually beautiful.<br /><br />&#34;Lost America&#34; contains five sections: &#34;Where the Lanes Are Wide&#34; (photographs of abandoned Miracle Mile towns), &#34;Drive In, Drive Out&#34; (you guessed it, drive-in movie theaters), &#34;The Last Resort&#34; (The Salton Sea), and &#34;Salvage&#34; (machines with one foot in the grave). Troy Paiva introduces each section with an excellent essay detailing the history of the subject and its demise. The essays are fluid and informative. Mr. Paiva turns out to be  one of those photographers who writes the text for his photographs better than anyone else could. There are about 90 5&#34;x7 1/2&#34; color photographs in this book, all with explanatory captions, and some smaller black-and-white photographs as well. I have really enjoyed looking at these images over and over again. My only misgiving about the book is that I wish it were hardcover and perhaps a little larger. Nevertheless, no fan or practitioner of photography should be without Troy Paiva's haunting historic images. Aficionados of 20th Century popular culture may also find &#34;Lost America&#34; valuable for its graphic representation of how cultures and their icons came and then passed into oblivion.

At the time, the technology of moving pictures was in its infancy and the author, W.K.L. Dickson, was working with Thomas Edison to create and perfect what would later come to be known as cinematography. Inspired by the Zoetrope in 1887, Thomas Edison set out to create a means of recording images that would allow continuous playback, as the phonograph had done for sound. The first part of this book recounts the trials, successes, and failures that the inventors faced in their attempts to create such a machine. The fruits of their efforts were the kinetograph, which photographed moving pictures, the kinetoscope, which provided a method of viewing them, and the kineto-phonograph, which is analogous to our modern movie projectors. Once these devices have been invented, the book goes on to explain the particulars of filming a motion picture and impresses upon the reader the endless  scientific, journalistic, and recreational uses that this new technology promises. The authors give detailed descriptions of many early films, which ranged from animal studies to capturing a sneeze to humorous skits. It's fun to read about the dreams these early cineastes had for their new invention and how they envisioned it would improve our understanding of the world and preserve virtually everything for posterity. Cinema might not have shaped the world exactly the way these visionaries predicted, but shape it it did. The book includes a selection of images from those very early films. Recommended to anyone interested in the history of cinema or in Thomas Edison's many inventions.	2003-11-03

Gracie and Mark's two dogs, Sarah and Dottie, became the Bakery's mascots and tireless taste-testers as the business grew from Dan and Mark's kitchen to 32 stores and a hopping mail order business. &quot;Amazing Gracie&quot; is the story of this family: Dan, Mark, Gracie, Sarah, and Dottie, their business, and of an unlikely canine hero who went from throwaway pup to national celebrity by means of love and loyalty. Dan Dye is an entertaining storyteller who often takes a humorous tone when speaking of his and the dogs' misadventures -probably advisable when your roommate and business &quot;partner&quot; is a humongous slobbering deaf dog. &quot;Amazing Gracie&quot; is a funny, moving true tale and a reminder of how animals can touch and even radically change the lives of the humans who care for them.	2003-11-03

He spent 9 months in Andersonville and Florence prisons as a prisoner of war. &#34;Dancing Along the Deadline&#34; is his detailed account of his experience in these infamous prisons, written originally for his family, then published during his lifetime. Mr. Ripple commissioned Civil War veteran and war correspondent James E. Taylor to illustrate his memoirs with drawings that depict scenes that he describes. This edition of &#34;Dancing Along the Deadline&#34; contains 55 of Mr. Taylor's black and white drawings, captioned by the author. Ezra Ripple worked closely with James Taylor on these excellent drawings to ensure their accuracy, and they help the reader immensely in forming a mental picture of what the prisons and their residents actually looked like.<br /><br />In &#34;Dancing Along the Deadline&#34;, Ezra Ripple paints a detailed picture of the conditions which captured Union soldiers endured inside Confederate prisons. As starvation was the greatest hardship, Ripple writes a lot about how the prisoners acquired food and how they made the most of it. He describes the physical layout of the prisons, the prisoners' routines, the prison guards and administrators, and his interaction with them. Although Andersonville was the Confederacy's largest and most infamous prison -and Ripple attests to its ruthless commandant- Florence prison actually had a higher death rate, in spite of its more sympathetic administration. And Ripple might have died there if not for his skills as a fiddler. He and several other prisoners formed a string band which performed for the officers and at local social gatherings. Ripple's memoirs are characterized by his general lack of malice toward his jailers. He was a religious man and a staunch patriot, so those are the eyes through which we see his world. He doesn't lump the Confederates who imprisoned him and his comrades into one &#34;enemy&#34; group. He criticizes the behavior of some, praises the character of others, and places the ultimate blame for the dreadful conditions in Confederate prisons on Brigadier General John H. Winder, who was in command of the prisons and whose goal  seemed to be to bring all of the prisoners to their deaths. Although Ripple describes a lot of horror within the walls of Andersonville and Florence prisons, he claims to have omitted some &#34;horrible details&#34; of which &#34;common decency&#34; forbids mention. Reading his memoirs, I think we can guess what some of those &#34;details&#34; might have been.<br /><br />&#34;Dancing Along the Deadline&#34; is required reading for anyone interested in the Civil War. And it's an interesting account of how people endure the unendurable and then how one man looked back on it.

Captain Geddes was court-martialed because he had accused a fellow officer, Lieutenant Louis Orleman, of conducting an incestuous relationship with his teenaged daughter, Lillie Orleman. The courtroom drama  lasted three months, during which the despotic nature of military law and the obsessive propriety of Victorian society combined to produce what now looks like a bizarre spectacle, indeed, as well as a probable miscarriage of justice. And the scandal didn't end there. Eventually, even General of the Army William Sherman involved himself in the saga.<br /><br />Louise Brooks places Geddes' trial in its social and historical context by delving into the culture's attitudes towards incest, as evidenced at the time by the Lord Byron-Harriet Beecher Stowe scandal, virginity, and the military's view of justice and proper conduct. It is interesting to see how 19th century social mores, with all of their contradictions and peculiarities, were so graphically reflected in this one scandalous court-martial. Notorious court cases frequently make excellent eyes through which to see a culture's less public character. I have to disagree with the author's assertion in the book's epilogue that incest continues to be a taboo subject. I think it could be described as a genuine preoccupation in some circles these days. And I question the author's repeated claim that incest was thought to be so improbable and unnatural that the possibility of its existence was emphatically denied in Victorian society. There is ample evidence to indicate this was the case among the literate middle class -at least in public. But I find it unlikely that incest was so denied among the vast poor and rural populations who did, after all, share beds with their siblings well into their teens and, in many cases, lived on isolated homesteads or farms where they had limited contact with people outside of their own families. My understanding of rural and peasant culture leads me to believe that incest was tacitly acknowledged by most of America while it was being categorically repudiated by polite society. Regardless, Captain Andrew Geddes' court-martial is a revealing slice of American history, and  &#34;Ungentlemanly Acts&#34; does a good job of explaining the context and implications of the case. Recommended to anyone interested in the social history of the United States or in the history of military law and codes of conduct.among the literate middle class -at least in public.

Stone's Study Still Fascinating After All These Years	First published by the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club in 1937, &#34;Bird Studies at Old Cape May&#34; is ornithologist Witmer Stone's exhaustive study of the bird life in Cape May County and along the New Jersey coast between 1920 and 1930. 374 species of bird are  described: 318 from Cape May County, primarily from the area stretching from the town of Cape May along the shore to Cape May Point, and 56 species from further north along the New Jersey coast. The book opens with several introductions from previous publications, including one written by Roger Tory Peterson for the 1964 edition. The introductions are followed by short chapters describing the bird life in different geographic areas of Cape May County -sea, meadows, islands,woodland, farmland- as well as history of previous bird life at the Cape, descriptions of bird migrations, and summaries of bird occurrences by month. The bulk of the book consists of descriptions of each of the 374 species observed. For each species, there is a physical description, information on the occurrence and history of the bird in this region, and stories of Stone's personal experiences with the species as well as those of other birders of his acquaintance. Some entries are less than a page in length, while others are up to 12 pages, but the average length for each species is a few pages. There are short introductory essays before the sections on ducks, hawks, and shore birds.<br /><br />This is an absolutely fascinating study of the birds of the New Jersey shore. Bird enthusiasts who have been to Cape May will find engaging and still relevant descriptions of birds which continue to be found there. And it is most interesting to learn the history of these species before much of Cape May's wetlands were filled in, along with the histories of some species which are no longer found in the area. Reading &#34;Bird Studies at Old Cape May&#34; 65 years after its original publication, it is in some ways more informative than it was in 1937. It allows us to observe, for even longer than Witmer Stone did, how and why Cape May changed and its bird population along with it. 941 pages is a lot of information to absorb, but I've found it a very pleasant book to pick up now and then and read the entries for a few species at a time. The order of the book is a mystery to me, but there is an index.It allows us to observe, for even longer than Witmer Stone did, how and why Cape May changed and its bird population along with it. 941 pages is a lot of information to absorb, but I've found it a very pleasant book to pick up now and then and read the entries for a few species at a time.

The first 213 pages of this 460-page book is a World Checklist of Birds, which lists all of the world's bird species by their order and includes notation as to their threatened, endangered, or other status where it is applicable. This is followed by 70 pages dedicated to information about the birds themselves. There is a useful chart giving American and British equivalencies in names of birds. There are diagrams, definitions, and many fascinating statistics on bird anatomy and physiology. There are more diagrams and statistics relating to eggs and incubation as well as statistics on mortality and avian diseases. And there are several pages listing truly amazing world records among birds that are sure to make a trivia buff out of you. The next 142 pages contain information about birding, past and present. Included is a Who's Who in Bird Biology and Conservation, information about major ornithological organizations, the birding codes of ethics from both the American Birding Association and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and tips for attracting and feeding birds. There are also extensive listings of bird-watching and bird-banding organizations around the globe, birding hotlines, magazines, newsgroups, festivals, and tours. And there is a glossary of terms in the back of the book. Most of the information in \\"The Bird Almanac\\" pertains to North America and Great Britain. The book might have been more aptly named \\"The Birding Almanac\\", since it contains more information on birding than about the birds themselves. But the bird information that is here is quite fascinating and has been gleaned from so many different sources that it would be difficult to find elsewhere. Where else could I learn that a peregrine falcon can dive at speeds of 117 mph (wow!), that the largest nesting colony contained 136 million passenger pigeons (scary), or that a group of cormorants is called a \\"gulp\\" (funny)?

The libraries discussed are those in the Mediterranean and Near East regions, from which our modern Western library systems ultimately derived. This book includes chapters on the oldest known libraries in the ancient Near East, the Greek libraries in which we begin to see the roots of our own, the extraordinary Library of Alexandria in Egypt, the growth of libraries beginning in the third century B.C., the first truly public libraries in Rome and its empire, the evolution from rolls to codices as the preferred literary medium, and the rise of monasteries as literary repositories in late antiquity. As Casson describes these ancient libraries, he also discusses literacy, publishing, bookmaking, and bibliomania in the ancient world, thereby providing a glimpse into the social history of these cultures from the unusual perspective of their literary values.  Through ancient literature, itself, and through archeological finds, Casson is able to piece together a reasonably detailed picture of what early libraries looked like, how they functioned, and whom they served. I recommend \\"Libraries in the Ancient World\\" to anyone interested in ancient history or the history of books or literacy. This is a small, easily absorbed volume packed with fascinating facts and insights into the role and reverence of books in the ancient world.	2003-09-27

She adopted Tiko when he was already over thirty years old, after his previous owners died. Tiko was opinionated, set in his ways, and a little slow to accept his new home and human companions. But years of patience and concerted effort paid off as Tiko became fiercely attached to Joanna and ultimately completely trusting of her. \\"The Parrot Who Owns Me\\" is a touching and fascinating account of the developing bond between a parrot and his human - and a human and her parrot. Probably because she is an ornithologist, Joanna Burger puts up with some behaviors from Tiko which might horrify many parrot owners. But her desire to understand his natural inclinations is our gain, as we learn what it's like to live in a household that is sometimes governed by parrot imperative. Her extremely patient husband, Mike, deserves a great deal of credit as well. As much as this book is the story of Tiko and Joanna's relationship, it is the story of this ornithologist's relationship with birds over the course of her life. Joanna shares stories and her feelings about the previous parrots in her life and the fieldwork she has done -and continues to do- around the world. Entertaining and enlightening, \\"The Parrot Who Owns Me\\" is a must-read for anyone interested in parrots or animal-human relationships.	2003-09-23

Over the course of a decade, he traveled to the Falklands, South Georgia, South Orkney Islands, Antarctica, and the Southern Ocean, where his subject was penguins. In &quot;Penguin&quot;, Lanting exhibits his photographs from these expeditions, in which he aspires to evoke the personalities of the individual birds and convey some sense of the experiences that their lives entail. &quot;Penguin&quot; features photographs of a wide variety of penguin species, from the diminutive to the imposing: Emperor, King, Gentoo, Gal&aacute;pagos, Rockhopper, Macaroni, Magellanic, Ad&eacute;lie, and Chinstrap, representing all four main clans of penguin species. The book is organized into three large sections: Coming to Land, Going to Sea, and Living on Ice, which each consist of an preface by Lanting introducing us to the featured penguins and explaining a little about their lives, followed by many color photographs of penguins doing what the sections' title implies. There are also several smaller sections containing an introduction, an essay about photographing the penguins, and an image index. Most of the images in this book are at least full page. Many span two pages. Some images are accompanied by captions, but more detailed captions are found, alongside thumbnails of the images, in the image index. This is a little awkward, but it does allow images to be printed full page without having to leave room for captions. The reproduction quality of the photographs in &quot;Penguin&quot; is not on the level of fine art books, but  it is very good for a book in this price range. Recommended for penguin lovers and Frans Lanting fans.	2003-09-22

But when he double-crossed his employer, the revenge inflicted robbed Case of his ability to &#34;jack in&#34; to cyberspace ever again. Case went to Chiba City, a center of urban decay where anything could be bought or sold, and acquired a drug habit to replace his addiction to cyberspace. One day a woman named Molly turns up in his &#34;coffin&#34; with a proposition. Molly is a technologically enhanced human with reflective night vision glasses implanted over her eyes and lethal blades beneath her fingernails. She is the muscle for a man named Armitage who wants the use of Case's previous cyber-skills. In return, he will correct Case's neural damage so that he can do the job. First they have to steal a construct of a deceased computer jockey. Then they fly to Istanbul to forcibly collect another member of their team, Peter Riviera, a sleazy character whose neural implants allow him to project subliminal messages into the minds of whomever he chooses. Then the team is off to a space station called Freeside where they will carry out their mission. The plan is to infiltrate the home of the secretive Tessier-Ashpool family, who own one of the world's largest and oldest conglomerates. Tessier-Ashpool is governed by its original family members who rotate in and out of cryogenic state, and by  two artificial intelligences. But the purpose of the mission and the identity of their employer are mysterious and may have epic repercussions.<br /><br />Published in 1984, William Gibson's &#34;Neuromancer&#34; may not have been the first &#34;cyberpunk&#34; novel, but it defined the genre and gave birth to the term. At its most basic, the story of &#34;Neuromancer&#34; is a classic caper plot: a mysterious and imposing character assembles a team of individuals, each with his own talent, to break into a target structure. The characters of &#34;Neuromancer&#34; are, in fact, stock characters in a stock plot. But so are fiction's greatest stories.  &#34;Neuromancer&#34;'s choppy, brooding style that tells the story through the experiences of one person, Case, owes a lot to noir detective novels. Dashiell Hammett comes to mind. It is interesting to note that Dashiell Hammett's style was born of alcoholism and urban violence and corruption in the 1930's. &#34;Neuromancer&#34; was born of the urban  decay and violence of the 1980's, which was to reach a post-War high within a few years of the novel's publication. And many of &#34;Neuromancer&#34;'s characters are drug addicts. History repeats itself, and it is those qualities that put the &#34;punk&#34; in cyberpunk. As for the &#34;cyber&#34; part, &#34;Neuromancer&#34; introduced us to &#34;cyberspace&#34; and was the first to describe a computer network in terms of a geometric &#34;matrix&#34;. Although the technology to &#34;jack in&#34; to computer networks has not yet come to fruition, and who knows if it ever will, the interconnectedness and interdependency of &#34;Neuromancer&#34;'s computers is strikingly similar to the Internet today. I think that &#34;Neuromancer&#34;'s instant cult appeal can be attributed to two things: It makes technology sexy. Molly was one of the first cyberbabes. And she is immediately attracted to Case, who is a geeky, pallid computer hacker. And &#34;Neuromancer&#34; describes a future on the fringes of society where urban alienation and technological alienation have combined to create a sort of existential hell, an idea that reflected the experiences and expectations of a disillusioned Generation X.  &#34;Neuromancer&#34; is a science fiction novel that is still appealing and thought-provoking 20 years after it was published.

Harry Potter is fifteen years old now and awaiting the start of his Fifth Year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He has been in a sullen mood since the tragic events of the last school year, and being cooped up in his Aunt and Uncle's house all summer hasn't improved his disposition. To make matters worse, Harry and his cousin Dudley are attacked by dementors, the shadowy creatures who guard the Wizard prison, while walking home one night. Soon afterward, Harry is whisked away to the headquarters of The Order of the Phoenix, a society of witches and wizards who are committed to resisting the return of the infamous He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. There, Harry learns from his Godfather Sirius that Voldemort is trying to acquire some sort of weapon which he hopes will help him vanquish his enemies. Once Harry is safe at Hogwarts, he is beset with dreams of a room with many doors, and his scar hurts more frequently than ever before. Harry and his friends must try to figure out what these things mean while Hogwarts is thrown into turmoil under a new draconian headmaster.<br />The most striking element in this fifth installment of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series is that Harry is no longer the lovable, goofy, and eager-to-please child that he was in the previous installments. He is, instead, a brooding youth on the verge of manhood. Readers will be immediately struck by Harry's foul mood at the beginning of the book, and that mood  doesn't let up. Harry's distemper may be partially attributable to the traumatic events of the previous school year. But it seems that his attitude is most likely brought on by frustration. He has reached the point -and the age- where being treated as a child while he repeatedly saddles the responsibilities of an adult no longer sits well with him. He's tired of being kept in the dark about events which directly affect him, and he's tired of others making decisions for him. And he is impudently angry at anyone who would perpetuate this status quo. This is the book where we see J.K. Rowling transform her hero from precocious child to young man.

R.H. Lockhart's account of the years he spent representing Britain's Foreign Office in Russia is still immensely entertaining and informative today. Lest the book's title mislead you, Lockhart was not an espionage agent; he was a diplomat.  He was Britain's Vice-Consul in Moscow, then Acting Consul-General, then official \\"unofficial\\" representative to the new Bolshevik regime in Russia, between the years 1912 and 1918. In his memoirs, Bruce Lockhart describes his attempts at rubber farming as a young man in Malaysia and the circumstances that led to his seeking a career in the Foreign Office. Perhaps because he was a talented linguist, or just because he had gained the favor of his superiors in the Foreign Office, Lockhart was given the post of British Vice-Consul in Moscow shortly after joining the Service. In these memoirs, Lockhart gives us his insights into Russian culture and politics during the last years of Tzarist rule, the circumstances of Russia's participation in World War I, and Russia's descent  into Bolshevism. Lockhart came to love the Russian people and consider Moscow his home while he witnessed the last Tzar unwittingly ensure his own downfall and the succeeding Provisional Government inevitably fail. Lockhart gives an honest account of the errors in  British and Allied policies during these precarious years in Russia. We get a close-up view of the eternal rift between diplomatic knowledge and political imperative. And we witness history repeating itself when foreign policies are adopted for political, not logical, reasons, and so inevitably fail. \\"Memoirs of a British Agent\\" is a supremely literate and insightful first-hand account of the fascinating and turbulent time in Russia that gave birth to the Soviet Union through the eyes of a foreigner who knew many prominent members of both the Tzarist and Bolshevik regimes personally. Lockhart manages to convey great sympathy for Russians of various ideologies while at the same time speaking bluntly of their shortcomings. Rarely has a book that is so informative been so entertaining. \\"Memoirs of a British Agent\\" is a real page-turner. If Bruce Lockhart were still living, I would want to thank him personally for such an enjoyable memoir. Highly recommended.k regimes personally.

It contains a small number of carefully selected recipes by an expert author, as opposed to big cookbooks that strive to include as many recipes as they can, regardless of their quality. This is small book of only 48 pages and slightly less than 6x6 inches in size. But everything in it is excellent. Author Kathy Farrell-Kingsley has chosen 19 chocolate cake recipes that include layer cakes, tortes, cupcakes, souffles, bombes, ganache, and more. The recipes are easy to follow and each is accompanied by a lovely color photograph. Recipes for frostings, glazes, and sauces are found in the back. I am not a huge chocolate fan, but the recipes in this book are so good that I am temporarily converted to chocoholism whenever I take a bite of any of these cakes. Even if your only interest in chocolate cakes is the traditional chocolate layer cake, &quot;Chocolate Cakes&quot; is well worth your attention. It has a recipe for a simple chocolate layer cake called &quot;Mom's Best&quot; that is delicious beyond description. It puts all other chocolate layer cakes to shame. The chocolate buttercream frosting is the best I've  ever tasted as well, and has many uses beyond the cakes in this book. I give &quot;Chocolate Cakes&quot; the highest recommendation to chocolate lovers and to anyone who likes to bake cakes.	2003-08-29

There are fourteen essays, each by a different author, and a glossary of Matrix terms as well as short bios of the contributing authors in the back of the book. The essays address  a wide range of topics as they relate directly to the film: the nature of reality, the evolution of artificial intelligence, postmodern theory, Judeo-Christian symbolism, Buddhist metaphors, and the science behind the Matrix' technology. The last three essays don't discuss the film itself, but express ideas about emerging technologies which may make a Matrix-like world of human-machine interdependence a reality in our future. Editor Glenn Yeffeth has given us  contributors with opposing views in many cases, so many of the essays are grouped in pairs so that we can read them in a point-counterpoint style. The very fact that \\"The Matrix\\" can be interpreted as representing both Socialist and Capitalist, Monotheist and Pantheist, Postmodernist and Crass Commercial ideals may provide the greatest insight into the film's genius and staying power. My only criticism of the book is that, among its many interesting essays, there are none that analyze the film's meaning in and of itself, as opposed to  discussing its relationship to various external religious and philosophical doctrines. \\"The Matrix\\" borrows from and alludes to numerous esteemed  schools of thought, but it is the film's own fascinating, complex, and thought-provoking conditions that make \\"The Matrix\\" resonate so powerfully with its audience. \\"The Matrix\\" has a philosophical identity of its own. That said, the essays that are included in this collection are thoughtful and enlightening. I recommend \\"Taking the Red Pill\\" to fans of \\"The Matrix \\" who would like to delve further into the film's iconography and implications.	2003-08-29

The hero is Ezekiel &#34;Easy&#34; Rollins, a war veteran who came to L.A. for sunshine and good jobs, but now finds himself laid off and in danger of losing his home. A friend introduces him to a sleazy character named DeWitt Albright, who offers Easy the opportunity to make some money fast. Albright is looking for a woman named Daphne Monet. In a city that is largely socially segregated, Miss Monet, who is white, frequents black night clubs and has black friends -some of the same clubs and friends as Easy. Whether in desperation or out of pride, Easy accepts the job and sets out to find her. His search takes him on a tour of the city's shadows: underground jazz clubs, bootleggers and blackmailers, political corruption, and finally to the irresistible and mysterious Daphne Monet.<br /><br />&#34;Devil in a Blue Dress&#34; is a pleasant, brisk read. Walter Mosley paints a colorful and intriguing picture of post-War Los Angeles. And his prose effectively expresses the fear and temptation that constantly compete for Easy Rollins' psyche. Easy Rollins is a working class detective who is lent a certain romanticism and distinction by the time and place in which the novel is set. This combination of qualities make Easy an ideal detective novel protagonist who will appeal to a wide array of readers. The character of Daphne Monet is less than believable, I'm afraid. But it is more essential that she be sexy and mysterious  than that she be believed, so it is not a serious flaw. &#34;Devil in a Blue Dress&#34; has a little of everything -a likable hero, period ambiance, hard-boiled dialogue, sex, violence, mystery- without losing its focus. It won't appeal to fans of &#34;cozies &#34;, but most mystery buffs will find something enjoyable in it.	2003-08-02

This discovery led him to write this &quot;Field Guide to Snow Crystals&quot; to explain the basics of snow crystal identification and metamorphism to interested laypersons. In this case, &quot;snow crystal&quot; includes what is commonly called a &quot;snowflake&quot;. So if you are  interested in understanding snowflakes, this book is for you. The field guide has three parts. The first section addresses the identification of snow crystals. There are charts which allow the reader to identify any snow crystal (or snowflake) that he finds. And there is an explanation of how and why snow crystals form. The second part of the book explains how to photograph a snow crystal, which might be of interest to photographers specializing in close-up work as well as snowflake enthusiasts. The third and final section of the book contains 50 photographs of snow crystals, which illustrate discussions of what happens to snow as it falls and as it sits on the ground under various conditions. The metamorphism which causes snow crystals to alter their form as they lie on or under the surface of snow is both pictured and described in detail. The differences between snow, hoar, and rime are also pictured and described so that the reader can easily differentiate between them. I have only a casual interest in snowflakes, and I enjoyed this book. It made me think about the variety of forms I have seen snow take, and now I understand what I was looking at.  My only criticism of this &quot;Field Guide to Snow Crystals&quot; is that it lacks a glossary of terms. New terms are explained as they arise, but a glossary in the back of the book would have been a helpful quick reference. I would recommend the &quot;Field Guide to Snow Crystals&quot; to skiers, mountain climbers, snow rangers, and anyone who has an interest in better understanding snow or snowflakes.

Nick and Nora Charles have decided to spend Christmas in New York, away from their California home and family business. Nick was a hard-drinking hard-nosed private detective before he married Nora. But Nora's family money paid for his early retirement, and now he wants nothing to do with the investigation business. One afternoon when Charles is out drinking, he runs into Dorothy Wynant, the daughter of an old client of his. She's looking for her father, an eccentric old inventor named Clyde Wynant. When the headlines splashed across the next day's newspaper say that the inventor's secretary and mistress, Julia Wolf, has been found shot to death in her apartment, a lot of people begin to wonder about Clyde Wynant's whereabouts. Mr. Wynant's lawyer, Herbert Macaulay, plies Nick for information. Clyde Wynant's ex-wife Mimi also questions Nick about her former husband. Dorothy Wynant flees her mother and step-father's apartment, and Nora invites her to stay at hers. Nick finds himself in the middle of a mystery he never wanted to know about. But when a thug forces his way into the Charles' apartment at gunpoint and the police shake Nick down for answers, he is left with no choice but to investigate the case. Nick's investigation takes him to New York's speakeasies and into its underworld, through the sordid affairs of the Wynant family, and leads to two more murders before Nick is confident he has cracked the case.<br />Fans of the 1934 film \\"The Thin Man\\", which starred William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, will likely be a bit shocked when they read Dashiell Hammett's novel on which the film was based. Although the film is excellent in its own right, the characters were altered beyond recognition to make them more palatable to a wide  audience. Dashiell Hammett's novel is hard-boiled and cynical beyond words. Nick Charles is a violent drunk who married young Nora for her money so that he could spend the rest of his days sleeping and drinking and would never have to work again. Nick and Nora don't like each other very much and don't treat each other very well. The only interest they share is found in the bottom of a whisky glass. All of the characters in \\"The Thin Man\\", regardless of social status, are hardened and, in one way or another, quite depraved. There are no likable characters in this novel. It would not be an exaggeration to say that every one of them is a pathological liar and a sociopath. But \\"The Thin Man\\" is a good read. The characters, although distasteful, are well-drawn, and Hammett renders every scene vividly. The dialogue crackles with sardonic wit and is the novel's great strength. Dashiell Hammett's novels and stories were extremely popular in the 1920's and 1930's. Readers had a real taste for the blunt talk and bold-faced corruption that reflected urban culture at the time. \\"The Thin Man \\" would have fewer fans if were written today. Even if people could get past its cynicism and lack of sympathetic characters, many modern readers will be put off by the novel's abusive attitude toward women and the fact that everyone is so alcoholic that his/her ability to function and speak with any coherence at all really stretches credibility. But I recommend \\"The Thin Man\\" precisely because it isn't like modern crime novels. Dashiell Hammett's style is admirable.

Yet Victoria Woodhull has been all but excised from the popular political and social histories of the 19th century America. With &quot;Notorious Victoria&quot;, author Mary Gabriel has written a meticulously researched biography which attempts to establish Victoria Woodhull's importance as a social reformer while presenting a balanced picture of this most controversial and outspoken feminist. Unlike her more respectable and more revered contemporaries, Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Victoria Woodhull had roots in poverty and was intimately familiar with the plight of the average American woman of the day. It was her conviction that freedom and equality for women would only be achieved when women had equality in marriage and in economics, and that the right to vote, although inalienable, was somewhat immaterial. This set her apart from the mainstream feminists who chose to concentrate narrowly on the less controversial agenda of suffrage for women and who eventually rejected Victoria wholesale for her radical advocacy of free love, workers' rights, and her talent for attracting scandal. The platform on which Victoria ran for President, representing the People's Party, would be radical even today in its call to prohibit government from enacting any law that would interfere with any individual's freedom &quot;to pursue happiness as they may choose&quot;. Victoria Woodhull was a fascinating, colorful, and flawed woman who lived in a time of social upheaval and media frenzy, which rightfully secured her a place in American history. My only criticism of Mary Gabriel's book is that it offers very little comment on Victoria Woodhull's startling change in attitude when she reached middle age. For twenty years she made a career out of exposing society's hypocrisies, and then suddenly she seemed to embrace hypocrisy with gusto. It is very possible that no one has any idea why Victoria so viciously turned against her former husband, Colonel Blood, and tried to rewrite her earlier life. But I found the absence of comment on this puzzling behavior conspicuous. Nevertheless, &quot;Notorious Victoria&quot; is a fascinating and sometimes scintillating account of one frank and gutsy 19th century social activist and the tumultuous society in which she lived. And since Victoria Woodhull was a passionate &quot;free lover&quot;, not a dry spinster feminist, her story is sure to intrigue and entertain an audience well beyond feminist historians, including many men.ached middle age.

The RSA is a public key algorithm that is widely used to encrypt data in our high-tech world. Sarah's work in trying to find a faster alternative to the RSA led, not only to a host of awards, but, unexpectedly, to worldwide acclaim and opportunities which she could not have imagined. She was invited to speak at conferences and in classrooms as far away from her native Ireland as Singapore and Milan. She was even a guest speaker at an IBM leadership conference for women when she was only 17 years old. And, at 18, she published &quot;In Code&quot;, which is the story of her mathematical life up to that point. Sarah's Father, David Flannery, who writes the introduction to this book, is a mathematician himself and so integrates mathematics into his home life that his five children became accustomed to solving math and logic puzzles from a very young age. Sarah talks about growing up in this environment and includes a smattering of mind-bending puzzles, taken from her Father's collection, for the reader to solve. Then she goes on to explain the basic formulas and concepts behind modern cryptography. Although no math beyond algebra is needed to understand these mathematical chapters, I found that a good deal of effort and persistence is needed. I have a background in calculus, and I found it difficult to grasp the notations involved in cryptography, in particular. Of course, this is probably because I have no discernible talent at number theory. Sarah's explanations of the mathematics of cryptography are as clear as they could be, and her enthusiasm for her subject is infectious. After the mathematical chapters, she tells us how she came to choose and research her science project, her quest for an alternative algorithm, and of her experiences in showcasing her discoveries around the world. Sarah Flannery is, somewhat surprisingly, an engaging and fluid writer. To write such a readable book about mathematics is no mean feat. &quot;In Code&quot; is an interesting and engaging story of discovery. It is perfect for anyone seeking a basic understanding of the cryptography that we encounter in almost every home and workplace today. And it's a winning scientific adventure story that is bound to capture the interest of all the budding young scientists out there.her experiences in showcasing her discoveries around the world.

According to the hypothesis put forward in &#34;Catastrophe&#34;, around the year 535 AD there occurred a major atmospheric disturbance that blocked out much of the Earth's sunlight all over the globe. Tree ring and ice-core evidence, as well as archeological and contemporary written accounts indicate that there was, indeed, severe climactic disruption at this time, and that it almost certainly was the result of a tremendous volcanic explosion. In &#34;Catastrophe&#34;, David Keys describes the ways in which he believes the famine, drought and plague that resulted from this explosive event directly and indirectly led to the downfall of the contemporary political powers and the emergence of the new political entities and forces which shaped the world we live in today. As every continent was affected by the loss of sunlight, Keys hypothesizes that the fall of the Roman Empire, the emergence of Islam and the Arab and Ottoman Empires, the reshaping of Eastern Europe, the creation of the modern nations of Japan, China, and Korea in the East and the European powers in the West, the collapse of the great Mesoamerican Empire of Teotihuacan and the emergence of the Mayans, among other great shifts in power, were all indirect results of the climactic changes unleashed in  535 AD.<br /><br />I find it unlikely that all of the developments that David Keys attributes to the &#34;catastrophe&#34; would not have occurred otherwise. While the direct consequences of a single event are predictable and substantiable, the indirect consequences of something are, of course, impossible to know for sure as there are other factors involved. How many of the developments which occurred in the centuries following the eruption of 535 AD would not have occurred, or would have occurred at a different time, or would have occurred by different means, if the climactic catastrophe had not set change in motion is impossible to say. But David Keys' point is well taken: &#34;Forces of nature and other mechanisms&#34; beyond human control have played -and may continue to play- a fundamental role in human history, culture, and achievements. &#34;Catastrophe&#34; reintroduces the concept of determinism to the discussion of human history, which has been unfashionable for a while now and is due for reconsideration by the academic community. Keys also gives the reader a nice overview of the transition from the order of late antiquity to that of protomodern nations all over the globe, which is interesting and informative regardless of what may have instigated the changes.or would have occurred at a different time, or would have occurred by different means, if the climactic catastrophe had not set change in motion is impossible to say.

Law, with the cooperation of the Regent Duc d'Orleans, ushered France from oppressive debt to glorious wealth and introduced the world to the ideas of stock options, futures, conglomerate corporations, marketing, and an all-paper monetary system before his system crashed under the pressures of bad judgment, bad circumstances, and his enemies. Ironically, although John Law's ideas are as relevant today as they were 280 years ago, if not moreso, Law has been largely ignored in the 20th century by everyone except economic historians. To remedy this, Janet Gleeson has written a very readable biography of this economic visionary who did, indeed, invent modern finance, and who  created the demand for transparency in banking matters and the concept of economic opportunity and upward mobility for all that we take for granted today. Because \\"Millionaire\\" is intended for the general reader, the author has simplified the details of Law's systems and kept numbers to a minimum, so you needn't be put off by the math. Far from tedious, John Law's story, his ideas about money, and his experience are as fascinating and revealing today as they were when he lived. John Law's life and legacy were no less than a quest to understand the ever-elusive nature of money, itself. His story has all the ingredients of a  wildly entertaining novel... and all the lessons of a life that saw great accomplishment and equally great failure: politics, human nature, love, sex, violence, art, luck, greed and philanthropy, poverty and wealth, genius and stupidity, success and failure, and, most of all, Money, the currency of all those things. \\"Millionaire\\" is recommended reading for anyone living and investing an industrial economy.	2003-06-27

It is primarily a much-needed thorough forensic analysis of the ship's sinking, based on data from recent expeditions to the site, never before published or analyzed journals, letters and interviews with witnesses, and information from the original investigations of the disaster. What physically happened to the ship at every moment from just before its impact with the iceberg until it hit the ocean floor is spelled out in detail.  Some helpful diagrams are included as well. I was amazed and fascinated by how much of the activities on board the Titanic during its final hours could be reconstructed when all eyewitness accounts are considered. Among other things, new information may exonerate Captain Smith of much of the blame for the tragedy, while thrusting Bruce Ismay of the White Star Line and Captain Lord of the Californian into even harsher light than previously imagined. As is typical of Charles Pellegrino's books, \\"Ghosts of the Titanic\\" is written in the order in which the information came to light instead of being organized by topic. This creates a sense of anticipation and allows the reader to understand the Titanic in ever-increasing depth, little by little, just as Dr. Pellegrino and his colleagues did. But the lack of conventional organization may frustrate some readers, and it means you don't find out about some crucial details until the end of the book.

There are only a few chapters dedicated to her life before she met King Hussein of Jordan. Then she tells us how and why American urban planner Lisa Halaby became King Hussein's fourth and final wife, Queen Noor al Hussein. Queen Noor details the challenges of adjusting to her new  role, the politics of the royal court, striving to understand her adopted culture, and finding a satisfying role for herself as Jordan's Queen. Queen Noor talks a great deal about her husband, King Hussein, and  does so with such sympathy and admiration that her love for him is palpable. Her love may have blinded her to some of the King's faults, but it is touching to read of the great emotion and dedication that she felt for her husband. There can be no doubt that it was Lisa Halaby's great love for King Hussein that motivated her to jump head-first into a foreign culture and the daunting responsibility of becoming Queen Noor al Hussein.  &#34;Leap of Faith&#34; is politically charged in places, as might be expected of a story set in the Middle East. Being an American-born wife to a Middle Eastern monarch may make Queen Noor especially qualified to help Americans understand Jordan's point of view. And she takes this opportunity to explain Jordan's position in matters concerning Israel and the first Gulf War.<br /><br />I'm not sure that Queen Noor intended it, but I found her ability to adapt to the demands of her new life as Jordan's Queen to be the most impressive and interesting aspect of her character. Lisa Halaby was an independent and private person. In becoming Jordan's Queen, she lost her privacy; her life became public; and that life was no longer under her control. In addition to these circumstances with which many celebrities and royalty must cope, Queen Noor had to assimilate into an entirely new culture and language at the same time, as well as learn to represent a nation in a very volatile and complex part of the world, all while her husband's life was constantly imperiled. That's a lot of stress, frustration, and adjustment for a person to endure. She seems to owe her success in this overwhelming task to her willingness to embrace her new husband, culture, and role thoroughly and without reservation. King Hussein's second wife, British-born Queen Muna, was not able to do that and was very unhappy in Jordan. It took a lot of courage and tireless effort for Queen Noor to throw herself so completely into every aspect of her new life and to make a place for herself that she, her husband and the Jordanian people could embrace.represent a nation in a very volatile and complex part of the world, all while her husband's life was constantly imperiled.

In \\"Her Name, Titanic\\", the disparate events in question are the sinking of the ocean liner Titanic in 1912 and its discovery on the ocean floor in 1985, as well as subsequent missions to document the Titanic's wreckage more fully. \\"Her Name, Titanic\\" presents previously unpublished information about the sinking of the Titanic in the form of fictionalized narratives and direct quotes from survivors, based on newly discovered (at the time of writing) diaries and communication logs. There is much discussion of the technology and accomplishments of deep sea exploration, including  interviews with Bob Ballard and other members of the teams that discovered and explored the Titanic wreckage. I didn't like \\"Her Name, Titanic\\" as much as I usually like Charles Pellegrino's books. This book actually focuses on one subject more than most of his books do, which turned out not to be a good thing. I found Pellegrino's enthusiasm to be somewhat less infectious than usual, as the middle portion of the book bogged down with too much talk about deep sea submersibles. Of course, if this is your field of interest, you may find that part of the book fascinating. Titanic aficionados will be thrilled to read new accounts of what happened that night in April 1912. I give the new information 5 stars and the more tedious aspects of the book 3 stars, so 4 stars as a whole.	2003-04-17

It is also generously illustrated with color photographs of most of these birds. There are short chapters on Getting Started, Longevity, Training, Nutrition, Grooming, Avian Medicine, and Breeding. But these chapters are overviews of these subjects more than comprehensive how-to guides. The bulk of the book is dedicated to describing the birds. There are chapters on: African Greys, Amazons, Australasian Parrots, Cockatoos, Conures  (only the most common species of conure are covered), Eclectus, Lories, Lovebirds, Macaws, and some additional Smaller and Unusual Parrots. The book seems to be intended as more of an exploration of the characteristics and delights of parrots than as a how-to reference. This probably explains why the sections on each species are not organized into breeding, housing, diet, history, etc. subsections. These topics run together. This does make it difficult to relocate something you have read, but it gives the book a more prosaic and narrative style, which I believe was the author's intention. I think any bird lover will find the information in &#34;The Complete Parrot&#34; interesting, but it would be most helpful to those who are trying to decide which species of bird to buy, or if bird ownership is the thing for them at all. The author gives more details about the personalities and abilities of more species of birds, in themselves and compared to each other, than I have ever seen in one place. He also relates his personal experiences with birds, as well as those of other bird owners. And he frequently gives some interesting history of the species. This information, along with the nice color photographs, will really help you chose a bird that is right for you. If you are considering a conure, you'll need a book dedicated to conures for more detailed information on the many species available.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who likes interesting bird stories and lovely bird pictures, but especially to those who are wondering which species of bird they should get.more detailed information on the many species available.

If someone wanted to make a case for animal rights, it would probably have a greater chance of success if it were based on animal intelligence, as that is much easier to prove and quantify than emotions. But there is already a body of literature on animal intelligence, and many researchers continue to pursue an understanding in that area. This is why Jeffrey Masson has written a book on animal emotions. It is a topic that is very much underrepresented in literature, probably because the idea of animal emotions is much vilified in the scientific community. The content of \\"When Elephants Weep\\" comprises, almost entirely, evidence of the existence of emotions -some primitive, some complex- in animals other than humans. Most of the evidence is anecdotal, although there are some examples of controlled studies as well. Most of the emotions that are discussed fit into these broad categories: fear, hope, love, sadness, grief, rage, compassion, shame, aesthetic appreciation, and a sense of justice. Apart from the evidence presented, the text contains a lot of criticism of the scientific community's staunch reluctance to acknowledge the existence of emotions in animals on the basis that any such idea would be anthropomorphic. But the fact is that the scientific community can no more prove the existence of emotions in humans than it can in animals. And it will not be able to do so until it possesses the technology to identify and detect the neuropathways responsible for emotions. Until then, we accept that humans have emotions based on their behavior and our own experience. The author believes it perfectly reasonable to acknowledge the emotional lives of animals for the same reasons. The quality of the writing itself  in \\"When Elephants Weep\\" is not especially good, but I do recognize that it is very difficult to produce a pleasant and engaging writing style when one is simply cataloging a lot of data. And the author occasionally does seem to be imagining emotions where they could not possibly exist. But I give this book 4 stars and recommend it because it tackles an important subject that we read about all too little. And, despite its faults, readers will come away from this book having learned a lot about the lives of animals. If you need more encouragement, Dr. Jane Goodall has given the book high praise.duce a pleasant and engaging writing style when one is simply cataloging a lot of data.

First published in 1913, &#34;Titanic&#34; is his detailed account of the last day he spent aboard ship, the evacuation of passengers on the port side of the ship, and of his incredible survival on an overturned lifeboat after being plunged into the frigid ocean when the Titanic finally completely submerged. The first 113 pages of the book are dedicated to Colonel Gracie's firsthand account. In the remaining approximately 200 pages, Col. Gracie has compiled testimony from as many other eyewitnesses as he could find. These firsthand accounts of passengers and crew are taken from the official inquiries in the United States and Great Britain, personal correspondence and interviews with Col. Gracie, and occasionally from firsthand accounts that were published in books and magazines of the day. Taken together, they render a very detailed picture of what went on that fateful night and why more people were not saved. Colonel Gracie died 8 months after the Titanic sank, of illness possibly related to the prolonged exposure to cold that he endured the night the Titanic went down.<br /><br />This is one of the most comprehensive and precise accounts of the Titanic disaster that you will find. Colonel Gracie is an engaging storyteller. I like his decision to organize the eyewitness accounts by lifeboat. The book also provides some interesting insights into the manners and social attitudes of the time.	2003-03-29

The title refers to the naturally &#34;quiet light&#34; of dawn and sunset which provided the illumination for the photographs within. The photographs are mostly of the natural world and range in perspective from close-ups of plants to sweeping landscapes. Some of the photographs are excellent, some mediocre, but the collection really conveys a specific mood and gives the viewer a strong sense of the style and themes of John Sexton's work during this period of time.<br /><br />The quality of the paper is very good. It is difficult for me to comment on the quality of the reproductions because I haven't seen the original prints of any of them. In looking at the plates closely, it seems to me that some shadow detail has probably been lost. That always seems to be the case in fine arts photography books.<br /><br />I particularly appreciate the technical information that Mr. Sexton thoughtfully provides toward the back of the book. The type of camera, lens, filters, film, exposure, and development information are given for every photograph. This will answer all of those &#34;how did he get that shot&#34; questions that every photographer, casual or pro, will inevitably ask himself/herself.<br /><br />A worthy addition to any collection of nature photography or fine arts black-and-white books. A great introduction to John Sexton's work. A nice synopsis of his work from this period.... And a fine choice of adornment for your coffee table as well.	2003-03-15

Sharp Sports Betting is a complete lesson in betting on the NFL. For the beginner, there is  instruction on what kind of bets are available and how to place them. And there is detailed instruction on how to handicap sporting events and determine what bets are worth taking using complex statistical analyses. I say that it is a complete lesson in betting the NFL because most examples that the author gives are from the NFL. Much of the book's content can be applied equally to other sports, and the author frequently tells you exactly how to do that. But I would say that it is not a complete lesson in betting on other sports, due to its emphasis on the NFL.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the workings of sports books, Sharp Sports Betting explains how to place bets, money management, calculating what you stand to win on bets, and what types of bets are available, including separate chapters on money lines, over/under bets, props, parlays, and teasers. There is a glossary of sports book terms in the back of the book. And there is a chapter on internet sports books.<br /><br />Moving beyond the basics, the author lays out his highly mathematical methods of handicapping sporting events and choosing bets. I have to say that I was not at all surprised to find out, on the last pages of this book, that Stanford Wong is also a professional blackjack player. He earned his way through graduate school playing cards. He has written books on blackjack. And he handicaps sports precisely like a blackjack player. I think the cardshark perspective that Wong brings to handicapping sports lends a little extra interest and unique content to Sharp Sports Betting. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the guy is a statistics and probability nut. He doesn't actually make his own lines, so there is no instruction on line-making. He just tells you how to beat the lines that the sports books are offering, using probabilities. At least half of this 384-page book is dedicated to teaching the reader how to calculate probabilities of various things happening in a game -pretty much anything that could happen in a game, actually. I wouldn't know how to begin to explain it, so I won't. In addition to instruction, the author includes a lot of charts which aid you in predicting outcomes, many specifically for the NFL, but some relevant to other sports. There are also 2 appendices with charts of Poisson distribution of events (probabilities), one cumulative and one not. A third appendix contains charts for win-lose-push probabilities.<br /><br />Sharp Sports Betting is a good introduction to sports betting for the novice. Its very mathematical tone and in-depth instruction on calculating probability make it useful for the intermediate bettor, as well. The author's passion for applying statistics to sports, in the spirit of a card player, may result in some fresh ideas for the experienced handicapper also.ate probabilities of various things happening in a game -pretty much anything that could happen in a game, actually.

Beat the Sports Books is primarily devoted to teaching the reader how to handicap his/her own NFL games -specifically, how to make your own lines. The author, Dan Gordon, has over 20 years of experience handicapping and betting on NFL games and gives the reader the benefit of this experience. He explains, in considerable detail and with many examples, how to calculate your own lines and power rankings and how to determine which bets are worth making. This is an in-depth course in line-making and takes concentration and persistence to fully absorb. The author also devotes one chapter to pointers for betting at different stages in the NFL season, which is simpler and might be worth considering even if you don't intend to make your own lines.<br /><br />62 of the book's 165 pages are appendices. Appendix 1 follows one NFL team through an entire season in order to illustrate the finer points of calculating a team's power ranking over the course of a season. The second Appendix contains a full season (1996) of bets that the author made with explanations of why he made each bet. Included are some bets that he didn't make and reasons that he passed on those. The appendices could prove to be  invaluable references if you intend to get serious about NFL betting, especially betting over the long haul.<br /><br />There is some information in this book that is not about handicapping. The title of the book's first chapter is: &#34;How Pro Football Is Bet and How the Point Spread is Set&#34;. It includes explanations of different kinds of bets (spreads, over-under, parlays, parlay cards, reverses, teasers) and explanations, with examples, of how the Las Vegas Sports Consultants set their lines each week. In chapter 2, the author goes on to explain how the media can affect betting, how touts work... These chapters contain a lot of interesting information that would be useful to both serious and casual NFL bettors.<br /><br />Beat the Sports Books is really dedicated to teaching you how to determine what bets to make. There isn't much advice on precisely how to place those bets beyond the author's emphasis on trying the get the early lines and shopping for a fair price on your bet. There are no lists of sports books or internet casinos or instructions in how exactly to communicate  what you would like to bet once you've found one. The information in Beat the Sports Books would seem to be intended for the relatively experienced bettor.<br /><br />I'll risk repeating myself here, just to be clear: Beat the Sports Books is a lesson in handicapping NFL games with an overwhelming emphasis on making your own lines. Dan Gordon provides the reader with detailed instruction in the methods that he uses to calculate lines, based on over 20 years of experience as an NFL bettor.

Bird Life was the first book about birds that I bought when I began seriously observing the birds in my neighborhood. I have more sophisticated guides to birds now, but I still refer to Bird Life for interesting bits of information that I just wouldn't find in any field guide. At only 4x6 inches in size and 160 pages, Bird Life looks like it was made to put in a pocket and take into the field. But it isn't really a field guide. It is simply the largest collection of information on the most different aspects of bird behavior in the smallest space. A list of the topics the book addresses will show you what I mean by that: bird behavior, preening, how birds sleep, feeding, food storage, social displays, family life, songs and calls, hearing, flight, navigation, longevity, conservation, attracting birds, feeding birds, and making bird feeders from common household items. None of these topics is covered in an exhaustive manner. Bird Life provides an introduction to each of these subjects. It doesn't help much in identifying birds, but helps you to understand their daily lives. The information is general but includes examples of species that engage in specific behaviors. And there are illustrations of bird behaviors and anatomy. As an introduction to birds, this book is tops!<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who has ever encountered a bird! Really. It is easy to read and full of fascinating facts. You don't have to be a &#34;bird person&#34; to enjoy this book. You only risk discovering that your avian neighbors might be more interesting than you  realized. Casual birders will find some intriguing info that they may not have read before.

If you've been looking for a book to help you identify caterpillars, you may have noticed that field guides for butterflies and moths are nearly useless in this regard. Entomologists don't seem to be nearly as fascinated with the larvae of these creatures as they are with the adults. But this is the guide you've been looking for! Although the First Guides are written for children, this book is suitable for adults as well and is by no means remedial. The book is made to take along at 3 3/4x7 1/4 inches in size and 128 pages long. It begins with an introduction to caterpillars which explains their structure, life cycle, protective mechanisms, and gives brief instructions for attracting and caring for caterpillars. This is followed by pictures and descriptions of 120 caterpillars. Each caterpillar is clearly illustrated for easy identification. Illustrations of the adult moths and butterflies are included, so you will know what the little critter will turn into. (All illustrations are drawings.) There is a description of each caterpillar which includes details of its appearance, size, diet, and where it is found. A few caterpillars that are dangerous to handle are marked with don't-handle signs. (They won't kill you; they cause skin irritation, pain, and rashes, at worst.)<br /><br />Recommended for everyone who would like to know just what those caterpillars are and what they will become. A great gift for kids who like the outdoors. The book's only real shortcoming is that it is not comprehensive. We can always hope that the publisher will add more species in a later edition. In the meantime, this guide will enable you to identify most common species of caterpillar.	2003-03-04

Unfortunately, the exhibit did not come to a city near me, so I cannot comment on how well it is represented in the book. Since I did not see the museum exhibit from which the photographs were taken, I will be commenting on how this book fares as a stand-alone &#34;coffee table&#34;-type book of Ansel Adams' photographs.<br /><br />The book has 191 pages, is 14 1/4x12 3/4  inches in size, and is hardbound with an oatmeal-colored linen cover and slipcase. Also included with the book is a 13x11 inch reproduction print of Aspens, Dawn (1937), which is suitable for framing. The book begins with a 42-page essay on Ansel Adams' life and career (don't worry, big print) by John Szarkowski, the book's editor and the director emeritus of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art. The essay is followed by 114 tritone plates of Ansel Adams' photographs, all black-and-white.<br /><br />I think the most helpful point that I can make about this book is that it is not a book of Ansel Adams' &#34;greatest hits&#34; or of his best photographs. I have yet to find a complete collection of either of those things. This is a very abridged version of the Ansel Adams at 100 museum exhibition which, as far as I can ascertain from the photographs in this book, sought to give the viewer a broad perspective of Ansel Adams' relationship with photography and with nature over the course of his life. Some of the photographs are great and some quite mediocre. But you will find photographs in this book that you have never seen before (unless, of  course, you saw the exhibition). This includes a few very early photographs from the 1920's which are not very good, but are significant when contemplating Ansel Adams' whole career and the photographic history of that period. My favorite part of the book are some plates which have two versions: one that was printed in the 1940's or 1950's and a later print of the same image made in the 1970's. These plates are on facing pages so it is easy and interesting to see how Adams' perspective changed over the course of his life. I was reminded of some of my own work from long ago which I recently looked  at and thought how differently I would print it now. (Adams' earlier prints are better, and so are mine. So much for improving with age.)<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are looking for a comprehensive book of Ansel Adams' best work, this is not it. If you are a fan of Ansel Adams and would like to learn more about how Adams' work and nature photography as an art progressed and changed over the course of decades, this would be a great book to have.

Fil Hunter and Paul Fuqua  have written a truly essential reference for product photographers and an outstanding educational text for all photographers. Light, Science and Magic teaches its readers the principals of lighting. It describes in detail how to light surfaces, metal, glass, liquids, extremes (black-on-black and white-on-white), and people for different effects. These subjects were chosen because they are reputed to be the most difficult subjects to light. But because the book emphasizes the principals of lighting, those lessons can be applied to all lighting situations. The examples in Light,Science and Magic are in-studio, but the principals apply out-of-doors and anywhere that there is light. You don't need to have a background in studio photography or a knowledge of lighting equipment to understand and benefit from this book. You  need to have only a good understanding of exposure and camera operation. Information on basic lighting equipment is found in the appendices for those who are unfamiliar with studio equipment. Because the principals of lighting apply equally to film photography and digital image capture, most of this book's content will not go out of date. No photographer should be without the knowledge in this book. If you can absorb all of the book's content, there is nothing that you will encounter in all your photographic adventures that you won't know how to light to get the effect you want.

Part of the Klutz series of books and originally intended for older children and young teens, Hair has gained a following among long-haired women of all ages because it is simply the best book out there for attractive long hair styles. When I grew my hair out after many years of wearing it short, I went looking for a nice book of hairstyles for long hair. I looked everywhere I could think of with little success -until I found Hair in a bookstore's children's section. Don't be put off by the Klutz label or the fact that there is a box of ugly hair accessories physically attached to this book. It provides excellent illustrations and easy-to-understand directions for 32 hairstyles, by my count. The styles are for medium length to long hair. Some styles would be better suited for thinner hair and some for thick. The illustrations and directions are given for doing the hairstyles on yourself, not on someone else. If you are doing someone else's hair, some adjustment can be made. Covered in the book are various types of twists and rolls, tucks and buns, braids, French braids, inverse French braids (cornrows), herringbones, and ropes. There are casual styles, styles suited to work, and many that could be quite formal. Page layouts are attractive and well-designed. The book is spiral-bound so it will lie flat while you are fiddling with your hair. Highly recommended for long-haired girls and women, ages about 10 and up. Makes a great gift!<br /><br />There is a cardboard protrusion on the bottom of this book to which the box of accessories is adhered. This prevents the book from being stood up on a book shelf. You can cut it off with a razor blade and a ruler. Then your book will sit perfectly on your shelf.	2003-02-16

You may have to wander a little further than your backyard to observe some of these species, but the birds in your neighborhood are probably in one of the three Stokes volumes. Each Stokes Guide to Bird Behavior features 25 common North American bird species. For each species, the authors explain visual displays, auditory displays, territory courtship, nest-building, breeding, plumage and seasonal movement, and provide a calendar so that you can clearly see when these behaviors occur. I wouldn't take any generalizations about bird behavior too seriously because many birds are very individual, and their behaviors and social customs vary accordingly.

You'll enjoy watching your little feathered friends all the more with the added understanding the Stokes Guides provide.<br /><br />My one complaint about these books is that the bird species are not in any particular order, and neither are they indexed. If you look at the table of contents you will see that the species are not in alphabetical or any other order, and there is no sense to which birds are in which volume or where they are placed in the book. In other words, you have to read through the entire list of 25 species in the table of contents, in each book, to locate the species you  want.

I bought this book because I was looking for some hairstyles beyond those found in basic books on braids and updos.There are some styles in this book in addition to the standard ropes, twists and French braids. They involve twisting your hair into zig-zags, looping, weaving a ribbon into your hair, or tying your hair into a big bow on the back of your head. These styles are ugly!  Just plain atrocious-looking! Trashy and/or bizarre. Salon Ovations should be able to do better than that.<br /><br />If you don't already own a copy, there is no more helpful or beautifully illustrated book for updos and braids than &#34;Hair: A Book of Braiding and Styles&#34;&#34; by Anne Akers Johnson. There are far more styles represented than in the Salon Ovations book, and they are better illustrated...for half the price. If you are looking for some good styles in addition to those in &#34;Hair&#34;, you won't find them in this book.	2003-02-04

And it does a good job of giving those photographers an overview of all the choices they have, but not a great job of providing a solid basis in exposure technique for the inexperienced or moderately experienced photographer. There are instructional chapters on composition, cameras, lenses, light, flash, film, exposure and gear. I am a fairly experienced photographer at this point, but I remember when I wasn't. And I can say that this book does not provide enough detailed instruction about exposure to answer all of the questions an inexperienced photographer would have, and make him or her comfortable with his camera's &#34;manual&#34; mode, and with a wide variety of lighting situations. The book does explain the differences between SLR, rangefinder, and various formats of cameras, which is unusual in an intro to photography book. I am sure that many novice photographers will find that information interesting. But I think that the publishers sacrificed more comprehensive instruction on exposure in order to include more of an overview of photography.<br /><br />The second section of the book, entitled &#34;A World of Subjects&#34;, comprises half of the book. Included are chapters on various types of photography: weather, landscapes, people, architecture, sports, close-up, motion, night. Interspersed among these subjects is a series of essays by National Geographic photographers giving tips and explanations of the sorts of photography they do. These essays are a nice addition to the book and provide some insight which might be useful to any level of photographer.<br /><br />The printing and paper are the high quality that you might expect from a National Geographic publication.<br /><br />For beginner and intermediate photographers looking for the most how-to info they can get, I would recommend Kodak's Guide to 35 mm Photography. I don't think that the National Geographic Field Guide is quite as helpful in that regard. However, it has some additional content which you might also find interesting, such as the essays by accomplished pros and the chapter on different types of cameras.quite as helpful in that regard.

Football is unlike most other sports in that you cannot figure out  how the game is played just by watching it. At least I never could. When I first began watching football a few years ago, I was puzzled by more than a few aspects of the game. I picked up a copy of this book, and all of my questions were answered! The author, Linda Wong, is the mother of NFL linebacker Kailee Wong (formerly of the Minnesota Vikings, currently with the Houston Texans). Linda and Kailee Wong have recognized that a lot of women know very little  about football and therefore cannot enjoy it. They have written this book specifically to address this problem. Most of the book is written by Linda Wong. It is organized in a very simple and straightforward fashion. There are chapters on the Basics, Scoring Points, Offensive Players, Defensive Players, Special Teams, and Common Penalties. Everything you need to know to understand what is going on during a football game is in there. The author's style is clear, concise and pleasant. She has also interspersed some entertaining personal anecdotes on her own experiences in learning about football throughout the text. Although the book's intended audience is women who have no idea why their friends/husbands/ boyfriends get so excited over a football game, this is really a terrific introduction to football that will allow anyone who lacks a background in football to understand and enjoy watching the sport. Football is fun to watch if you understand what's going on! I swear! I'm something of an NFL addict at this point. So if your friends spend Sundays glued to the television for 5 months of the year, don't even try to beat them -get this book and join'em!	2003-02-04

Sometimes it seems that nearly every instructional book written on the subject of photography includes a chapter on how to use your in-camera exposure meters. But this is the only book that is dedicated specifically to the subject of how to use a hand-held accessory exposure meter. This book is published and copywrited by Mamiya America Corporation. For this reason, it showcases their at-the-time top-of-the-line exposure meter, the L-508. The L-508 is pictured and alluded to throughout the book. However, if you are interested in learning how to use an incident light meter or a handheld spotmeter, everything in the book is relevant, no matter what brand of meter you use. This book does not address handheld area meters at all (by this I mean handheld meters which meter a wide area of reflected light). There is also information on using your meter as a flash meter, if it has that capability.<br /><br />I really found this book to be useful after I purchased my first handheld meter. The book is certainly not long...84 pages, but it contains all the necessary instruction and some nice photographs. The book is not really organized into chapters. Instead it is divided into many short sections. Some of the subjects covered are: why buy an incident meter, features of incident meters, how to choose a meter, incident metering techniques, spot metering techniques, flash metering techniques, how meters are fooled, filter factors, and metering for fill flash. The book also gave me some interesting ideas for photographs.<br /><br />In truth, the book is poorly organized, but I did not find that this detracted from the content very much. The three authors each wrote his guide for using handheld meters separately, and they are simply bound together in this book. So it is like reading 3 booklets on the same subject, which is repetitive, but no less informative than a better-edited book would have been. I do recommend reading the entire book, since each author has something to contribute.<br /><br />Recommended for those who are considering buying a handheld meter and for those who have a handheld that you aren't quite sure what to do with.r those who are considering buying a handheld meter and for those who have a handheld that you aren't quite sure what to do with.	2003-02-04

The good news is that this book does do a good job of providing enough information to get you off to a good start. You will be confident that you know what you are doing the first time you load a roll of Kodak CIR film into your camera. The book covers all of the topics essential to infrared photography, such as: the  physics of infrared light, how the film works, film handling, processing, pushing/pulling, using filters, focusing and various light sources. I give the book only 4 stars because it is not what I would call comprehensive. I wish some of the above topics had been covered in more detail and with more examples. There is only one example of using a yellow filter vs an orange filter, and no examples of doing this under different types of light. Filters are rather essential to IR photography, and I would have liked to see them treated in more depth. There is mention of the alternative AR-5 process for developing the film, but there is only one example of that, too. It peaked my interest, but I couldn't find out more. There is no information on cross-processing color IR film as a negative, which I know some people do. Mr. Begleiter probably doesn't cross-process his film, but some information on the subject would be nice. A little color IR goes a long way, but this book does showcase some nice examples of subjects for which color IR is actually appropriate and attractive, which is helpful and encouraging. All in all, this book not perfect, but it is a worthy addition to the library of any photographer.	2003-01-30

If you are a beginner or intermediate photographer, this book will tell you what you need to know to get the results you want in your photography. It covers the topics of film, exposure, and flash photography, from the basics to intermediate technique. It also has chapters that give advice on specific types of photography: action, existing-light, and close-up. There are also chapters on lenses and filters and a short chapter on digital manipulation. Most of the information in this book would be appropriate for digital as well as film photography. If you just bought your first SLR, or if you would like to better understand what your camera can do, this is the perfect book for you. It also makes a great gift for the young or relatively inexperienced photographer. Advanced amateurs may find it useful as a refresher or reference to keep for those occasions when you forget some technique that you haven't used in a while. But the book's intended audience is novice to intermediate photographers, and it does a very good job of addressing the needs of those photographers.	2003-01-29
US	44189182	RRXPOJLOBR2AY	0817450076	392191568	Night Photography	Books	3	32	45	N	N	Not useful.	There really isn't any information in this book on technique in night photography that is not self-evident. There are a few useful charts on reciprocity failure and adjusting exposure times for smaller apertures based on your light meter readings, but you can easily make these charts yourself. In fact, I wouldn't trust the reciprocity charts because newer films require much less compensation for reciprocity failure than those charts would indicate. Most of the information in the book concerns black and white photography, but there is some info on color negative and slide photography.<br /><br />The photographs in the book are not very good, either, which isn't encouraging. The picture on the cover is by far the best.<br /><br />A full third of this book is devoted to processing and printing night photographs, including a fair amount of information on toning. If you don't develop or print your own film, a third of the book is lost on you. And I can't really say if it would be useful to those who do process and print their own work because it has been so long since I have used a darkroom myself.	2003-01-29

I love this book! It contains everything you need to know to do SX-70 manipulation. There is comprehensive information on the film, all of the available cameras, tools for manipulation, using a Polaroid Daylab to print slides onto SX-70 film (including info on various models of Daylab), handcoloring SX-70 prints and making digital prints of your SX-70 prints. This is the definitve guide to SX-70 manipulation. Everything you need to know about SX-70 is in here.<br /><br />There is also a section on Polaroid image and emulsion transfers. This section contains information that is supplemental to the information in Kathleen Thormod Carr's other book, Polaroid Transfers, so don't consider it a substitute for Polaroid Transfers. There is some redundancy between the two books in that there are step-by-step instructions for how to use various models  of Daylab to print onto Polaroid films in both books. The models which are covered are different in the two books, however. Polaroid Manipulations covers Daylab 35 Plus and Daylab 120.<br /><br />Polaroid Manipulations also contains a &#34;gallery&#34; of SX-70 and Polaroid transfers by contemporary artists. And there is a terrific list of resources in the back, so you won't have trouble finding supplies.<br /><br />If you are in a photographic or graphic arts rut, this book will get you out of it! Outstanding!	2003-01-29
