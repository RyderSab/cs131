Other brands including Mack, Marmon, Western Star and Stirling feature some great examples and offer plenty of interest. <br /> <br /> <br />The most puzzling chapter for me is the substantial Volvo expose. Almost all of the Volvos pictured are rather ordinary trucks, the type you would expect to see in brochures. This is in stark contrast to the titkle of the book and all of the other chapters. Great for Volvo fans I suppose..though I feel that Mack fans probably deserved a better deal. <br /> <br />The book's footprint is an unusual and not overly large size, yet thankfully, very few truck photos find themselves cut in half between pages.  99 out 100 for this! <br /> <br />Comparing this title to her earlier work, there is a lack of interior cab shots. Despite this, it would be dificult to find another current or recent pictorial show truck book   that comes close to this one . Excellent value!! <br />	2004-10-12

David Jacobs has produced three excellent books on trucking in the USA and this example is full of Kenworths, Peterbilts and Freightliners, with a few different marques thrown in, including a notable International Transtar Eagle and a 1948 GMC.     Famous trucks of the Seventies such as  Fletchoe Diesel's W900A Kenworth, \\"Tootsie Roll\\"  and the Bob Wilson \\"Ironsides\\" KW are both given considerable coverage.

Any person just looking for fully dressed up tractor units may be disappointed.<br />Plenty of Eastern photos feature here and so Macks and the refuse industry get ample coverage.<br />Wreckers and utilities get their own chapter in this book, and there are one or two European trucks featured as well.<br /> If you like heavy truck racing in this era then this book is most definitely for you.	2004-01-23

Rather, it is a [personal collection of road experiences .    I mention this because the Peterbilt culture/legend is known to stand alone from the pack. There is even a driving style /seating position associated with Peterbilt drivers.    The reader is left to wonder if Haworth lives the Peterbilt legend/cult to the hilt, complete with the 'appropriate clothes, driving style, chicken lights, etc, because this is not revealed.     Apart from teaching the correct spelling of the word Peterbilt, this book will teach the reader litle else about the workings of the machinery itself. However,the book offers uncensored entry into the life of one particular trucker and the associatd loneliness, stress, discomfort, hardship and folly that goes with it.    The author also provides an insight on how and why some products get shipped from one side of the country to another, and explains a few examples to both interest and intrigue.     One of things about being alone on the road for long periods of time is that otherwise trivial events can become trip highlights. This in itself demonstrates how mundane this romanticised life can actually be. I think that Haworth portrays this rather well.      The author manages to keep the reader entertained throughout the book and provides a diverse collage of life amongst drivers, dispatchers,  roadhouses, dock workers and \\"lot lizards\\".    Homophobics will wince at some of the tales and puritans will not enjoy the sex, drugs and alcohol references. I hope that this does not put you off, because the book has much to offer, if the reader can put aside their own judgements and prejudices.    Alan Haworth tells it how it is from his perspective... an honest and open perspective that is also shared by some other truckers.     I really liked this book, even if I wasn't comfortable  at all times. What good is a book if it doesn't stretch and test you a little and provide an insightinto different aspects of life?	2003-09-19

This is essentially a heavy truck book, with a few fire engines, off road,and army vehicles thrown in. American trucks dominate and White and Western Star are particularly well covered with several examples. There are a considerable number of older English and European trucks to add flavor. An alphabetical list of truck pioneers and their accomplishments is an interesting addition.<br />With only 65 pages, one cannot possibly hope to end up with a comprehensive book, however this example carries considerable appeal because of its excellent choice of illustrations.	2003-09-19

This book is a huge improvement on the earlier Consumer Guide book entitled 'Big Trucks' published in 1979.<br />Some of the best examples of these brands are depicted... examples include International's Transtar Eagle Brougham, and White's Road Commander II, Western Star's flashy cabover, and these pictures are a blend of both showroom and working examples.<br />Text is concise yet does justice to each brand and describes models and their activities throughout the world.<BR>Well worth hunting down.	2003-09-10

Look beyond the low quality paper and plain soft cover and you will uncover a true diamond in the rough.<br />If you are a Seventies fan of American big iron then this book is worth hunting down and treasuring. Why? because you are unlikely to find such diversity of content in any other book.<br />For example, there is an excellent chapter on transmissions, complete with the many twin stick shifting pattern diagrams, Spicer,Fuller, 4x3,4x4,5x3,5x4 as well as the more common ten and thirteen speed Roadrangers. I am yet to find any other book which encompasses all of these combinations. <br />If that does not spin your wheels, then how about  engine options and specs for Mack WL/LS,  Cummins Detroit, Caterpillar (including 1693TA) specs, Spec sheets for trucks including White, International (4070 and 4200 series, )Ford, and a list from A to Z of American truck makes?

Don McTavish uses up 165 paperback pages to give a humorous glimpse into various forms of trucking, from his early days as a teenage yard boy, through to obtaining his driving licence, oil patch work, logging and high-mile hauling. Any trucker can relate to the stories and any enthusiast or persons seaking a career change and considering entering the industry will gain some useful advice and insight and plenty of laughs along the way.<br />Although the cover depicts a Mack, much of Dan's material involves transport in the sixties and beyond, much of it spent in Kenworths, including team driving a 1960 cabover KW with twin gearboxes.<br />For some old-school trucking fun, nostalgia, and a mix of diverse characters and experiences, this book is a gem.	2003-07-07

(64 pages)<br />Considerable coveraqge is afforded to light and medium duty trucks, and as such should appeal to collectors and fans of this catagory.<br />Most of the illustratons for the three big chapters have been lifted from OEM truck brochures and advertising material.<br />Although many of these photos would have been originally in full color,(especially from 1965 onwards) here they are all portrayed in black and white. In fact the only color which graces this book is to be found on the cover. For a book published in 1993, I find this disappointing.<br />Kenworth and Peterbilt fans seeking shiny chrome and polished aluminium will starve, but those interested in Whites, light and medium duty trucks, particularly from 1900 to 1939, should find this book a worthy addition to their collection.	2003-06-11

There are stacks of black and white pictures on 170 pages and some probably look better that way.<br />The preface to this book, first printed in 1977, reads \\" There are a lot of people who misrepresent truckers, like in songs, or in magazines, or in movies. As far as I am concerned, they're just makin' a buck on us. Your book better quote us right.\\" <br />The book presents both an objective view and also captures the mood of truckers and trucking at that time. Seventies nostalgia.	2002-09-07
US	37368718	R2N7WGIDF2MC66	076030825X	959581293	Classic American Semi-Trucks	Books	5	10	10	N	Y	Classic American Semi Trucks	If American Iron is your bag, especially 1960's through 1980's then it does not get much better than this. There is a brief history (just the way I like it) and some excellent classic trucks going back to the thirties, but mostly the late 50's onwards dominate this book, especially sixties, seventies, and eighties...<br /><br />Popular classics are well represented, e.g Kenworth A and B models, all the Macks, Peterbilt, Diamond T , Autocar, Marmon, Dodge Bighorn, Western Star, Freightliner Powerliner and even the DF400 International. Excellent paper quality and mostly color photos on 160 pages makes this an absolute treasure.	2002-08-30

'Great American Trucks' has 63 pages and a Peterbilt on the cover whereas 'Trucks' by same author was first published in 1979 and has a W900 kenworth on the front dustjacket. I bought Great American Trucks expecting it to be totally different and it is not, just an edited version of 'Trucks'<br />If you like \\"Cult of The Big Rigs\\" with the B model Mack on the cover, or you enjoyed 'Hammer Down\\" then 'Trucks' is of the same genre and a worthy addition to any truck library.It has all the text and photos from 'Greatest American Trucks plus a whole lot more.<br />What you get with 'Trucks' is a 176 page black and white and colour photo mix, with dedicated chapters to the major American marques, an article on Tyrone Malone as well as an article on engine choices etc. Some good interior photos and the book captures the era well. I rate 'Trucks\\" as a 4 to 5 star book, and 'Geat American trucks' as a 3 . I hope this helps you.	2002-08-30

The backdrops are awesome, the trucks are super sharp and the colour and paper quality are superb. Be warned though, Kenworths are very scarce in this book, but Peterbilt fans will love it, and other makes are given some coverage also.( KW and Pete lovers must also buy the sister book to this one, being 'The working trucks of Colorado'....now that is a book!)	2002-08-30

The book is 175 pages and it is about half way through the book before we sight the B model, so half is dedicated from birth to the fifties, and the rest of the book covers the period up until today. Plenty of Australian photos round this book out nicely and all the popular models are on display, often with multiple examples. Plenty of interior shots too. This book is excellent value for the money. Class all the way.	2002-08-30

However, as great as this book is... big and glossy with history and background info on several countries, I feel it could have been oh so much better.<br />For mine, there were not enough photos of the various models on offer, and only a scant history afforded to the different assembly plants...their opening and closing dates, and a list of all the current plant locations would be helpful.<br />There are photos of kenworths which are missing their model description. For example; the Australian Kenworth road train picture. Most readers would not know the model number, nor the years in which it was produced.<br />I would have thought that the W900 A extended hood model deserved a chapter of its own, with all the various big engine options listed and the fact that they are so keenly sought after today. See if you can spot one picture or mention of one in the book. While you are at it, look for a W900B as well.<br />As much as the T600 series may have revolutionised truck design, Canada and Australia produced their own models and these countries are largely glossed over.<br />If I was the President of Kenworth, I would have sent the author back to do the job properly. Much attention was focussed on the recent and current model line ups at the cost of the older ( and dare I say) more popular models. While it is easy to get new truck brochures showing interiors etc, it is the older models which are more difficult to obtain details on and it is these which hold moch appeal for fans.<br />This book took the easy route, and as one reviewer has pointed out, some of the writing reads like a truck brochure...thinly disguised advertising, and that is becasue  some of the material is from the truck brochures.<br />So, if you are into Kenworth by all means buy this book. Just do not expect everything to be there. Some day someone will be passionate and thorough enough to produce a book on Kenworth that rivals those written about Peterbilt and Mack.<br />If you want to learn more about Kenworth, and in particular Paccar, hunt down a copy of \\"Paccar The Pursuit Of Quality\\" by Alex Groner.ivals those written about Peterbilt and Mack.<br />If you want to learn more about Kenworth, and in particular Paccar, hunt down a copy of \\"Paccar The Pursuit Of Quality\\" by Alex Groner.	2002-08-30

US	37368718	R2KCFCLBVT4F8A	0964964562	480542626	2: The World's Greatest Working Trucks: The Best of Colorado & Utah	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	World's Greatest Working Trucks.. The best of Colorado	One of my faves. Not just because the cover and the inside pages happen to have some sharp W900A extended hood Kenworths in all their glory.     Peterbilt also features heavily in this edition and the book could have easily been entitled \\"Kenworth and Peterbilt in Colorado\\" because there is precious little of any other makes on these 96 glossy color pages.Oh well, you can't help bad luck!     Stunning photography, great backdrops and interesting text to boot. An absolute must-have for classic long-hood Kenworth and Peterbilt fans. Enjoy!	2002-08-30
