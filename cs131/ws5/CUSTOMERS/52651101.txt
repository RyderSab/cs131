Almost all of the stories are worth reading. The most particularly notable ones are: Tomorrow and Tomorrow (Adobe James)(an absolutely horrendous story about revenge), A Good Head for Murder (Charles Runyon), Invisible Cat (Betty Ren Wright), and The Distributor (Richard Matheson).  I think that A Good Head for Murder as well as Invisible Cat are absolutely two of the best suspense short stories that I have ever read.   <br />A great book for mystery/horror lovers.	2005-02-05

Of all the ones that I have read, this is by far my favorite.  Probably part of the reason it is so good is that there is so much basic plot and material there to work with.  She does do a great job of capturing the personality of Katherine of Aragon and the basic history of the period.  You learn a lot about the history of the time in a very entertaining way.
