As such, he seeks to train under Evangeline, who proved to be a VERY impressive mage when not under the restrictions of the curse.  At the same time, he decides to learn Kung Fu from Ku Fei-san to improve his melee attack and defence skills.  Ku Fei agrees to train him, but Evangeline is offended that he would learn Kung Fu and decides he must lay one hit on Chachamaru before she will train him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, gymnast Makie-chan discovers her coach finds her too childish to be a great gymnast.  Devistated, she happens upon a training Negi and decides to train to get even better for an upcoming competition. While they train, Se-chan and Asuna-san decide to train in sword techniques.  On the night of Negi's fight with Chachamaru, Negi takes a beating but gets Evengeline to agree to train him.<br /><br />Meanwhile Yue-san and Miyazaki come to Negi with some clues about Negi's father.  This leads the trio on a trip to library island without Asuna where they discover yet another dangerous secret of the island.  Asuna finds out and is offended, but things get worse when she and Negi get into a verbal fight and Negi seriously insults her. A trip by the girls to Ayaka's private beach doesn't help matters.  Will Negi be able to appologize for what he said?  Will Asuna forgive him?  Will Negi be able to master all of the training in time for the next battle?  Will Makie-chan prove her coach wrong?<br /><br />With this volume, Akamatsu-sensei is clearly taking things down a few notches in intensity but is laying the groundwork for the next big story.  The fight between Asuna and Negi was a lot like the fights between Naru and Keitaro in \\"Love Hina\\", but I suppose that's to be expected.  I enjoyed watching Negi train as he decides whether to be a battle mage or a traditional one.  Now that he has four full partners, it is even more important that he get better.<br /><br />Evangeline continues to be a cool character, though with a new translator, the very sassy \\"boya\\" is back to \\"kid\\" or \\"kiddo\\" (as I understand it).  The later two just lack the sass that \\"boya\\" has (IMO) so that was disappointing, but a minor thing.  Evangeline's puppet Chachazero continues to steal scenes when she appears. ^_^  Akamatsu-sensei knows a good thing and decided to find ways to keep her in the story.  It works and adds some nice spice to things.<br /><br />The tease about Asuna's past was VERY interesting as well.<br /><br />Bottom line: another good manga volume worthy of purchase despite not really advancing the main story.  However the time is not wasted and the groundwork is clearly being laid for the next volume when the main story arc is picked up again.l character, though with a new translator, the very sassy \\"boya\\" is back to \\"kid\\" or \\"kiddo\\" (as I understand it).

This fifth novel marks the first story not displayed in anime form.  Certain elements and characters were placed into the anime (Zanaffar into \\"Slayers\\", Xellos and Mazenda into \\"Slayers Next\\") but that's about it.<br /><br />From a story perspective, Lina, Gourry, and Amelia are attacked by a cult who worships the Mazoku Dark Lord -- Ruby Eye Shabranigdu.  A powerful female mage named Mazenda manages to seal Lina's power and the only way for Lina to break the seal is to kill Mazenda. With Lina no longer an asset, she is forced to flee a group of beast men with Amelia while Gourry covers their retreat.<br /><br />Lina finds herself trapped again, only to be rescued by a powerful priest named Xellos. Xellos has impressive magical abilities and Lina soon strikes a bargain to obtain some magical amplification \\"Demon Blood Stones\\" and an alliance with the priest.  He seems a bit distressed when he hears that Mazenda is a leader of the cult that worships the Dark Lord, so he immediately makes it his goal to \\"dispatch\\" her as well as obtain a copy of a Clair Bible manuscript (the original, complete Clair Bible recording all Mazoku knowledge, a manuscript being a copy of a section or page of the original).<br /><br />Zelgadiss also rejoins Lina's party with the idea of beating Xellos to the Clair Bible manuscript.  However things turn grim when it turns out that the cult has the manuscript and is using it to create a new demon beast known as Zanaffar.  Will Lina ever get her powers back?  Will Gourry return to the party?  Will the group be able to slay Zanaffar if Gourry isn't there with his Sword of Light?<br /><br />For \\"Slayes\\" fans, this novel should prove interesting since it is a new story.  I was disappointed that the theme from the 4th novel (Lina tracking down why the Mazoku had taken such an interest in her) seems to be missing from this novel.  Anime fans will know who Xellos and Mazenda are, but those items are NOT given in this novel.  Further, Mazenda's role is very limited and I was rather disappointed in that.<br /><br />Xellos, on the other hand, proves to be more interesting.  He's more like his \\"Slayers Try\\" self than his \\"Slayers Next\\" self.  Certainly, his vast powers in casting spells that even Lina had never done before (Blast Bomb for example) come through quite clearly.  Lina still is not as impressive as her anime counterpart, but the fact that she can pick up new spells so quickly (including Xellos's Amplification spell and \\"Blast Bomb) do give her more of a genious flair.  I found it interesting how she already knew the spell \\"Ragna Blade\\".  I found it REALLY interesting when it is revealed how she learned the super-forbidden spell \\"Giga Slave\\".<br /><br />Again, TokyoPop drops the Japanese honorifics, so now we get a lot of \\"Mister\\", \\"Miss\\", and \\"Master\\" to cover for this.  Also, TP changed \\"Dark Lord\\" to \\"Demon Lord\\" for some reason.  I guess it works, but why change it now?  And I still suspect that TP is toning down the translations to appeal to a younger audience.<br /><br />Bottom line: while I did enjoy the novel, it still lacks the depth that normal fantasy novels in the U.S. has.  Indeed, were this turned into an anime, it would barely cover six episodes (the first novel had to be stretched to cover nine episodes).  However, it is buy-worthy for \\"Slayers\\" fans and those who enjoy lighter reading material.da's role is very limited and I was rather disappointed in that. <br /> <br />Xellos, on the other hand, proves to be more interesting.

Magister Negi Magi, Vol. 4	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	School Trip Part 1 of 3	With the impressive mark left by Volume 3 of \\"Negima!,\\" I was eager to see where things went from there.  Fortunately things remain pretty good, we are introduced to two new characters and a 3rd gets some work as well.<br /><br />Evangeline tells Negi that he should take a trip to Kyoto as his father, the Southern Master, used to live there.  Thus Negi-sensei decides the class field trip should be to Kyoto and Nara.  The headmaster then gives Negi a quest to deliver a letter to the head of the magic association based there (Kansai Group) to stop an age-long feud between them and the Kanto Group.  Thus preparations begin by the students and Negi to take this 4-day trip. Konoka and Negi are out in a nice district of Tokyo and are spotted by the cheerleader squad who think the two are on a date.  Naturally Ayaka learns of this and will not tolerate anyone else being with Negi, so she grabs Asuna and begins her plan to make sure nothing happens between Negi and Konoka.<br /><br />The school trip finally starts with Negi-sensei being attached to a group of girls that includes Asuna, Konoka, Miyazaki (the library girl), Yue, and Saotome.  They are also joined by Setsuna-san, a girl with a nodachi - a giant, long sword.  Forces opposed to the Kansai Group and Kanto Group making amends begin to work with a series of mild attacks by frogs and then monkeys.  Setsuna is comes to the aid of Negi as she is sworn to protect Konoka-chan, whom she has known since a child and refers to with the very reverent title of \\"oujo-sama\\".  The battle heats up as Asuna (armed with a new weapon), Negi, and Se-chan team up to battle a female Japanese wizard and her summoned demons as they attempt to kidnap Konoka-chan.<br /><br />Once the battle is over, Miyazaki-san is determined to confess her feelings for Negi, something that has been brewing since Volume 1.  Being so shy, she has a very difficult time of it, but her friends Yue and Saotome are there to force her to keep on.  She is further aided by talking with Asuna and Se-chan.  Hearing someone may be confessing their love to Negi, Ayaka dispatches the class reporter Kazumi on the case.  Kazumi is bored with the assignment but soon comes upon the scoop of the century when she learns Negi's secret.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of fun \\"filler\\" in this volume, especially at the beginning.  The subplot of Miyazaki's feelings is sweet and while being told, the main story arc is not forgotten.  Kazumi's learning of Negi's secret should prove interesting and we'll see where this is taken.  There's more naked girl fighting in the manga than one would dare dream.<br /><br />Del Rey does its usual good job and I noticed that they are starting to use a little more of the sister honorifics (neesan) which is cool.  The standard extras of the spell lexicon, the translator notes, and early character sketches by Akamatsu-sensei are all included as are definitions of the honorifics.<br /><br />Bottom line: While not as intense as the previous volume, it is still very good and I look forward to seeing where the story goes from here.  Se-chan is a great charater and Asuna continues to grow on me.  Well worth the purchase.urther aided by talking with Asuna and Se-chan.

The School Trip arc has been very interesting, so I was eager to read volume 6.  Not only did I find this the best volume of the trilogy, but Del Rey has taken the plunge and made this an \\"otaku-friendly\\" translation which hardcore fans will appreciate, but normal fans will get into as well considering how much it adds to the translation.<br /><br />Negi and his group of girls (including Asakura) head back to the temple where Negi delivers his letter to the head of the temple, who also happens to be Konoka-chan's father.  He accepts, but unfortunately the enemies that have been fighting with Negi, Asuna, and Se-chan have a powerful new ally who has the form of a blonde-haired boy in a school uniform.  He overcomes the temple's natural defenses including those of Konoka's father.  Despite Asuna's best efforts, she is unable to keep the boy from kidnapping Konoka, though she is able to resist his petrifaction spell at the cost of her clothes.  In attempting to rescue Konoka, Se-chan, Asuna, and Negi have to face scores of summoned demons.  In order to rescue Konoka and fight the demons, Se-chan and Negi form a pactio so that she and Asuna can fight while Negi rescues Konoka.<br /><br />The reasons behind Konoka's kidnapping become clear as Negi's enemies intend to unseal a powerful demon that nearly destroyed the world centuries ago.  The battle looks grim until Yue, who's discovered the truth, contacts Kaede, the powerful ninja in the class.  Kaede and her allies Fei Ku (who knows powerful Chinese martial arts) and Tatsumiya (who is an expert with guns and who's bullets have been enchanted) provide cover for Negi, Asuna, and Se-chan.  Se-chan reveals a secret about herself as she rescues Konoka, while Negi is saved from death by an unexpected source.  With so many allies, can Negi now defeat the unsealed mega-demon?<br /><br />I have to say that this is my favorite volume of the series to date.  This is aided by Del Rey's decision to take the plunge and make the translation a bit more otaku-ish in nature.  This means that the various forms for \\"big brother\\" and \\"big sister\\" are left un-translated.  Each form has a different feeling and while someone like me may understand it, newbies may not.  That's not a problem because Del Rey gives an explanation as to why they are doing it.  I think they should have gone into a bit greater detail on the differences, but I won't complain.  Regardless, it adds depth to characters, primarily Chamo-kun who uses them the most.<br /><br />Another interesting item was when one charater calls Negi \\"b&ouml;ya\\".  This is Engrish for \\"boy\\", and I think they've been translating it as \\"kid\\" in earlier volumes.  However, leaving \\"b&ouml;ya\\" un-translated gives so much sass to the character saying it that completely belongs!  Obviously, the new staff in charge of \\"Negina!\\" understood this and I applaud Del Rey for this!  Del Rey also left Greek, Latin, and Japanese in the manga when spells were cast.  This gives it a more interesting flavor since it comes off more like spell-casting.  Del Rey has complete explanations at the end of each chapter which I liked better than having the spell lexicon at the end of the manga.<br /><br />Finally, Del Rey has a really cool extra (beyond the standard extras) which has Akamatsu-sensei's original artwork for the various tankoubon covers (front and back) and include his notes.  Tama-chan from \\"Love Hina\\" shows up in the notes and Akamatsu-sensei hints at a link between Motoko from \\"Love Hina\\" and Se-chan.  Very cool!<br /><br />Bottom line: Clearly, Del Rey understands the manga market with this volume of \\"Negima!\\" and it shows.  Combine that with Akamatsu-sensei's great story and this became the best volume to date!-ish in nature.

Chamo-kun will get ermine dollars and Asakura gets to have some fun and more.  A contest between several pairs of girls we've been previously introduced to is formed with the goal of kissing Negi. Asakura has rigged video monitoring in the inn for the contest and provides the play-by-play for the rest of the girls who are watching it on TV.  What they don't know is that Se-chan provided Negi with paper dolls which when activated create a duplicate of him so that he can help Se-chan and Asuna patrol the inn grounds.  The duplicates cause all sorts of fun and the girls that kiss them create flawed magic cards.  Only Miyazaki manages to kiss the real Negi and create a real card, which she is given a copy of though she doesn't know its true nature.<br /><br />Meanwhile Asuna is given a copy of her card so that she can activate her special weapon when she wants and she can communicate with Negi no matter how far apart they are.  Miyazaki overhears this and discovers the card creates a book for her, which then reveals to her information of things going on in the form of a picture diary.  So as Asuna, Negi, Chamo-kun, and a paper doll in the form of a mini Se-chan head to the temple to deliver the letter and finish Negi's quest, Se-chan guards Konoka-chan along with Yue and Saotome.<br /><br />Negi and Asuna soon find themselves in a magic trap where they battle Kotaro, a powerful kid in the Kansai Group.  Miyazaki follows the action from her book and eventually comes upon the fight in person.  Using the book, she helps Negi and Asuna as they fight for their lives.  Meanwhile Se-chan is attacked as another kidnapping attempt is made on Konoka-chan and has to defend Konoka-chan with her life.<br /><br />The story continues to become more interesting.  Even the kiss contest was very interesting though it only added little to the main story arc.  However, the groundwork is clearly being laid for some of these girls to have greater roles as we see with Miyazaki.  I like how her character is being brought along.  The amount of fanservice has dropped off in this volume.  It is still there, but considering the sheer amounts of it in Volume 4, it is a relief to have it cut back so much.<br /><br />Peter David is not part of the English adaptation in this volume, so his trademark humor is missing.  That's not a problem, just an observation.  Del Rey continues to do a good job with the honorifics, translator notes, spell dictionary, a display of the botched cards, some character sketches by Akamatsu-sensei, and an English preview of Volume 6.<br /><br />Bottom line: \\"Negima!\\" continues to impress with its interesting story and is turning into a favorite manga title of mine.

After the first two volumes of Akamatsu-sensei's \\"Negima!\\" manga, I can't say I was super impressed with what I'd seen.  Sure the art was great, there was some ecchi humor and TONS of ecchi images of his lolicon babes, so if you were into that, I'm sure things were great.  But I'm interested in story and it really hadn't gripped me that much.  Still, two volumes is not enough to judge a title on, thus I purchased Volume 3.  Boy am I glad I did that!<br /><br />Since the cover of Volume 3 gives away the central characters featured within, it won't be a spoiler to say that the entire volume is about Negi-sensei's fight with the vampire-mage Evangeline McDowell, who's also a student in Negi's class.  Eva-chan is partnered with the android Chachamaru, who's also in Negi's class.  Negi soon learns how important a partner is to a mage and fortunately for him, Asuna is watching his back.<br /><br />Joining the cast is the ermine Chamo-kun, who speaks and whom Negi saved in the past.  Chamo-kun becomes Negi's closest advisor, but he has his own agenda and really wants Negi to make as many probationary partnerships with girls as possible.  While Asuna agrees to be a partner, Negi decides he can't put others at risk and flees to the nearby wooded mountain region, where he runs into one of the Baka Rangers on ninja training - Nagase-san.  She manages to be what the doctor ordered and Negi finds his confidence again.<br /><br />As the battle with Eva-chan and Chachamaru continues, Negi learns that Evangeline has a connection with his father, the man known as the Southern Master who was supposed to have died when Negi was born.  As Eva's plot to free herself of the curse of the Southern Master continues, Negi must learn to trust his partner Asuna and Asuna must be willing to go that extra mile in order to gain the full benefits of being a mages partner.  Can they do it in time?<br /><br />I have to say that I was completely taken by surprise with the volume of the manga.  Shifting the focus away from ecchi romantic-comedy aspects to creating an enemy for Negi to fight was very good.  Not only that, but Evangeline being a vampire-mage was a very good stroke in my opinion.  She's a very interesting character made more so with her connection to Negi's father.  The mini-Chachamaru that Eva used to use (and may still use) was pretty cool and in a weird way, freaky.  Combine this with some nice writing and you've got a real winner.<br /><br />Del Rey continues to do a good job.  In the extras, we have a spell lexicon, initial character sketches by Akamatsu-sensei, translator notes, and a preview of Volume 4 in Japanese.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you passed the series because it didn't seem like more than a lolicon ecchi-fest, you might want to reconsider as this volume proves the series will be much more than that.

That makes for an improved manga, but still an extremely ecchi one.<br /><br />The first half of the book is dedicated to Negi-sensei, the \\"Baka Rangers\\" (of which Asuna is a member), and the members of the Library Club (of which Konoka-chan is a member) going on a quest to Library Island to find a magic book that is rumored to be there to make you smart.  Since Negi's career as a teacher depends on his getting his students' exam grades up, he's along for the ride, howbeit without magic!<br /><br />The second half of the book contains stories allowing us to explore the campus a bit more and to get to know three other girls - Chisame-chan (a cosplay, Internet Idol) and the Narutaki twins.  The relationship between Asuna and the class rep Ayaka is explored with some nice depth added to both characters and for me, the highlight of the volume.  Ayaka's deep attraction to Negi-sensei is a bit odd, but then Akamatsu-sensei seems to provide at least some explanation to it.  I suppose it is also his way of having a shoutacon element added to the story to be fair (the opposite of lolicon). ^_^;;;<br /><br />Finally, the element of Negi looking for a female partner is brought up when he receives a letter from his older sister in England.  However, nothing more is made of it other than being used as a vehicle to show Konoka-chan in a kimono to take pictures for an omiai (arranged marriage meeting).<br /><br />Del Rey does a really good job again.  As is standard, all of the normal honorifics are in the text (and explained for the unlearned).  Extras include more initial character sketches by Akamatsu-sensei, a section on some Latin terms, a section on spells Negi uses, and the ever-excellent translator notes.  The preview of Volume 3 in Japanese is included and it looks fantastic!<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you enjoyed the first volume of \\"Negima!,\\" you'll enjoy this one a little more.  There's still way to much ecchi content, but that's to be expected of a title by Akamatsu-sensei.st volume of \\"Negima!,\\" you'll enjoy this one a little more.

He is greeted by members of his homeroom, Asuna Kagurazaka (one eye blue, one eye green) and her friend and roommate Konoka Konoe, the granddaughter of the school's headmaster.  Much to Asuna's chagrin, Negi is assigned to their room.  Further upsetting Asuna is that the sensei she has a crush on, Takahata-sensei, will no longer be her teacher.<br /><br />While the school's headmaster knows who Negi is, no one else at the school is to learn his identity.  Unfortunately for him, Asuna soon learns Negi's powers as a mage.  While trying to help Asuna, Negi ends up accidentally making her life tougher.  Can these two come to a truce or will Negi's secret be exposed to the world?<br /><br />This first volume does establish a few of the many characters that are in this manga series, but does little else.  Those who've read \\"Love Hina\\" know of Akamatsu-sensei's love of ecchi fanservice and this volume has plenty of that.  However, since nearly all of the characters are junior-high girls, this becomes ecchi lolicon fanservice.  Akamatsu-sensei finds countless opportunities to have the girls naked (non-descriptive), in states of undress, or to have their underwear revealed.  It is my opinion that this level of fanservice is greater than it was in \\"Love Hina\\" and frankly it does nothing other than to toss a huge bone to the lolicon crowd.<br /><br />Still, Akamatsu-sensei does know how to draw, and with 31 girls not counting other supporting characters, he's got plenty to work with.  Where he will go with the story remains to be seen.<br /><br />As to Del Rey's treatment of the manga, well...  All of the main Japanese honorifics remain which I will always applaud.  Unfortunately, Peter David's adaptation is horrible.  He added sexual innuendo jokes where ever he thought he could get away with it.  He has Konoka saying dumb things like \\"anger management\\" when she says no such things in the Japanese.  He has Asuna flinging rocks at Negi so he could write a joke about rocks in the head.  She clearly was using an eraser and throwing chunks at Negi and no jokes were in the original.  But Peter thought there should be jokes and so jokes we get.  Plus, there's Negi's remarks implying he had poor grades, when later volumes (better done) by Del Rey clearly indicate Negi had good grades.  I really hope Del Rey will republish this volume to give us a clean version of it (meaning, stick to the Japanese script and don't add your own stuff to it).<br /><br />The extras are a bit light, with some of the initial character design sketches for a few characters by Akamatsu-sensei, translator notes (always a plus, though with Peter David's massive domestication, very limited), and a preview of volume 2 in Japanese (neat).<br /><br />Bottom line:  This latest work from Akamatsu-sensei isn't much more than a lolicon ecchi-fest with a few laughs and good art. Peter David's adaptation is horrible, but fortunately, Del Rey gets better in the future with this title.  And since the story gets better too (starting with volume 3), this is worth putting into your collection.tely, Peter David's adaptation is horrible.

My journey into the world of \\"Fruits Basket\\" started when I rented the 26-episode anime TV series from FUNimation.  I loved the series so much that I immediately sought out the manga from which the anime was based.  My money was not wasted.<br /><br />In Volume 1 of the manga, we get the first six chapters of this touching and humorous story that were the basis for episodes 1-5 of the manga.  Takaya-sensei begins to set the stage with this volume.  She does a wonderful job of capturing the tough life that Tohru-san has, yet managing to keep her with a positive attitude and a nature that doesn't focus on her own problems, but looks out for others first.  She's such a sweet, cute, and wonderful character that I couldn't help but immediate fall in love with her character.  Granted some people will be put off by this (and some of the sugary nature of the manga), but most folks I think will enjoy it.<br /><br />The other characters are very memorable.  The battles between Yuki-kun and Kyo-kun were amusing, but their working together to bring Tohru back home at the end of chapter 6 was very nice.  Shigure-san with his \\"older and wiser\\" moments combined with his ecchi thoughts makes him a fun character.  Kagura-chan, one of the female zodiacs in the Sohma family, is a hoot with her manic and violent nature as she expresses her love for Kyo-kun.  Tohru-san's best friends Uo-chan (the former \\"Yankee\\", or gangster) and Hana-chan (the girl with the deadly \\"vibes\\") are a lot of fun and should prove to continue to fill that role in the future.<br /><br />Takaya-sense has remarks scattered throughout the volume, some as side-bars and some at the beginning of a new chapter.  I found these to be a delight to read as it gave me more of an insight into the manga-ka's life.<br /><br />Finally, my hat is off to Alethea and Athena Nibley, the translators TokyoPop hired for \\"Fruits Basket\\" as well as the rest of the staff.  First, all of the Japanese honorifics survive and this is so critical to truly getting an understanding of the characters.  Just an excellent job by TokyoPop and I felt they should be praised for it.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you loved the anime, you'll love the manga.  If you've never seen the anime but you like a good, clean, humorous, & sweet story, you'll like this.  While targeted for the shoujo (girl) market, many guys will enjoy it too.is so critical to truly getting an understanding of the characters.

After helping Syaoran-kun save Sakura-chan by sending him and his companions on their journey (as documented in the \\"Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-\\"), Yuuko-san uses Watanuki-kun's love of Himawari-chan to get him to see a fortune teller that Yuuko-san uses.  When they get to the house, it is now occupied by another woman who claims to be a fortune teller.  After the session, Yuuki-san explains why that woman was a fraud, then finds the old woman who is a real fortune teller.  In getting a real fortune told, Yuuko-san continues to teach Watanuki, something the old lady notices with the symbol of the butterfly.<br /><br />The next story covers Yuuko-san deciding to set up a group date with Himawari-chan and Doumeki-kun.  Using the temple where Doumeki-kun lives as a setting, Yuuko-san sets the stage for telling summer ghost stories only to have these stories cause the \\"spirits\\" to attack.  Thus Doumeki-kun's abilities with the spirit realm is revealed.<br /><br />As before, volume two continues to weave an interesting tale.  Yuuko-san is such a great character.  Without her, I doubt I would enjoy this title as much.  As it is, despite her manipulations and fun, it is clear that she is grooming Watanuki for something, but it also appears that Doumeki-kun and Himawari-chan have their roles.  Doumeki-kun's role seems fairly clear, but Himawari-chan's role is unclear.<br /><br />The fun with the \\"Tsubasa\\" crossover continues.  If you haven't bit and purchased that title, no worries.  Del Rey makes sure to point out the crossover joke for the audience in the Extras at the end of the book.  Also, Del Rey continues its great Translator notes as well as its look at other CLAMP titles.  Del Rey continues to impress with their treatment of Japanese manga!<br /><br />Bottom line: Well worth purchasing for CLAMP fans as well as fans of good manga as this contains a nice mix of humor, a touch of romance and rivalry, and an interesting tale.ouch of romance and rivalry, and an interesting tale.	2005-06-20

The \\"Slayers Next\\" anime took material from this novel to make episodes 8 through 13.  There are lots of differences.  For starters, there's no Xellos.  Also, the Mazoko Mazenda is not in this novel.  Martina and Zelgediss are not here either.  A new villian, the powerful assassin Zuuma, does have a role to play though.<br /><br />As to the story, after escorting Sylphiel to her grandfather's house, it is obvious that things aren't right in Saillune.  Crown Prince Phil drops by for a vist and quickly hires Lina and Gourry.  He knows Lina from a previous encounter (which gets a couple of mentions in this novel, but was used to make the \\"Slayers\\" anime episode 11).<br /><br />Now involved in this plot to kill Phil, Lina and Gourry must find out who's behind the assassination plots.  However, Lina soon finds herself the target of a powerful assassin, not to mention she's also the target of a powerful mage, one that may be more powerful than she is.  She must learn the truth before Phil and she are killed.<br /><br />Amelia doesn't come off as over the top as she does in the anime, but it is clear that she's supposed to be a champion of justice, powerful yet a bit clumsy, & cheerful as well as clever.  I'm glad she'll be in the next novel.<br /><br />Another plus this novel pulls over the anime is the mystery of the attacks on Lina.  With no Xellos around, there's no one to secretly protect Lina, thus when demons are summoned in various forms (including one incident where Lina and Gourry's diner comes alive and attacks them), Lina is on her own with Gourry.  From time to time Amelia does assist, but not often.  Thus Lina's dispatching of the villian in the novel is more impressive to me than was her dispatch of the villian in the anime.<br /><br />I like how the novel goes in to a little more detail on the segments of the Mazoku Dark Lord, Ruby Eye Shabranigdu, including the segment which came alive 1000 years ago and is sealed in the north lands.  The exploration of the Mazoku is very interesting to me.<br /><br />As to the novel, my standard complaints of a lack of Japanese honorifics remains.  It is interesting that they appeared in the afterward.  It was also interesting when I read this line from the novel, \\"(The Mazoku) never refered to Shabranigdu by an official title or with any honorific.  Mazoku are very strict about their code, so (the Mazoku's) slip-of-the-tongue had been a clue to something else, or rather someone else.\\"  The Mazoku and the priest/miko use Japanese honorifics and I'd like to seem them left in.  The above quote is a main reason why.<br /><br />Bottom line: Of the novels released to date, this is the best one yet.

Ordinarily \\"xxxHolic\\" is a title I would have passed over despite being done by the four-woman manga-ka known as CLAMP.  Del Rey's superior translation work would be a winning vote, but only if I were desperate for some manga to read.  However, I had purchased CLAMP's other title which just happens to be running concurrently with \\"xxxHolic\\" AND be published in English by Del Rey -- \\"Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-\\".  I had purchased that because the lead characters were from \\"Cardcaptor Sakura\\" and I love that series.  However, CLAMP made sure that \\"xxxHolic\\" and \\"Tsubasa\\" were linked via the space-time witch Yuuko.  I found her so interesting in \\"Tsubasa\\" that I quickly went out and purchased this first volume of \\"xxxHolic\\".  It was a good purchase.<br /><br />Volume 1 covers the first seven chapters of the manga.  We are introduced to Kimihiro Watanuki, a high school boy who's being hounded by \\"spirits\\".  Through no act of chance, he comes upon the house of one Yuuko Ichihara, a powerful magic user who sells wishes for a price.  She was a companion of Clow Reed (\\"Cardcaptor Sakura\\") and knows a great deal.  She also has two small children in her care named Maru and Moro.  In exchange for helping Watanuki, Yuuko makes him work for her until he's earned enough credit to pay her fee.<br /><br />The manga covers two stories dealing with two customers of Yuuko's.  One has a problem telling lies and it is affecting her life greatly, though this woman is unaware of it.  The other tells of a woman's addiction to the Internet, especially chat rooms and message boards.  Through these two stories, Yuuko appears to be teaching Watanuki, but what she's preparing him for is unknown.  The manga ends with Sakura-chan and Syaoran-kun from \\"Tsubasa\\" arriving from another dimension seeking Yuuko's help.<br /><br />I found this first volume very facinating.  Yuuko is such a great character -- fun and manipulative.  Watanuki is a complainer, but as Yuuko says, he's a good worker and doesn't get on one's nerves.  I liked the hint of romance as Watanuki has a crush on the cute Himawari-chan and she appears to at least like him a bit.  It will be interesting to see where this goes.<br /><br />Del Rey gets MUCH love with their use of Japanese honorifics in the text.  They get MORE love with the inclusion of translator notes and notes informing the reader of references to other CLAMP titles.  Del Rey's work in the manga buisiness is impressive to say the least and makes my purchasing this manga VERY easy.  Thanks Del Rey!<br /><br />Bottom line: If you started reading \\"Tsubasa\\" by CLAMP, you are going to want to check out this title.  If you liked Seto-sama from \\"Tenchi Muyo! GXP\\" or \\"Tenchi Muyo! OAV 3\\", you'll love Yuuko-san!  If you are a CLAMP fan, you are going to like thier latest venture.

As one might expect, the story centers around the return of the Red Priest Rezo and the mystery surrounding it.  As in the anime, Lina and Gourry have a bounty on their heads and they set off to the city of Sairaag in order to learn the truth behind Rezo's re-appearance.<br /><br />Amelia being MIA aside, there are a number of differences from the anime.  For starters, Sylphiel comes off as much more competent.  She's already working with Zelgadiss by the time Lina and Gourry arrive.  While she does have her feelings for Gourry (which doesn't come through as clearly in this novel since TokyoPop decided to translate the honorific \\"sama\\" to \\"master\\", CMP having translated the same honorific to \\"darling\\" in the anime -- and people wonder why I think honorifics should be left in the text untranslated), she's no ditz and very powerful.<br /><br />Instead of Amelia or the swordsman Zangulus, there's the character of Lantz, who's a fighter that had a presence in the 2nd novel.  He's rather uninteresting as a character and it is no wonder the anime never used him.<br /><br />Also, Mazoku are present in this novel as well.  It is interesting that Hajime-sensei has had the Mazoku presence from the begining whereas the anime ignored it until the \\"Slayers Next\\" series.  Their dealings with Rezo were very interesting and even though I knew this story from the anime, the end was rather surprising to me.<br /><br />Bottom line: another interesting \\"Slayers\\" novel. TokyoPop continues to seem to tone down the orignal material and leave out the important Japanese honorifics (used mainly by and for the priest and miko) but it is still worth buying if you are a \\"Slayers\\" fan.	2005-04-28

For a title as deeply rooted in Japanese culture as \\"Kare Kano\\" is, I feel the honorifics need to be left in because it shows how the various characters relate to each other.  As such, those volumes were much richer to me as a reader who enjoys learning more about Japanese culture and ways of thinking.<br /><br />With volume 14, Chrissy is gone and with her the honorifics are also gone in favor of a more domesticated American approach to the translation.  So while the story is still good as we learn about Arima-kun's real mother, the richness and the unique Japanese way of things are lost.  To me, this is a really unfortunate thing since I find \\"Kare Kano\\" are really good series.  I know some folks think that anything remotely Japanese should be removed from manga or anime, but I would not be one of these people.<br /><br />As to the story, watching Yukino-san and Arima-kun continue their relationship is always a treat. Arima-kun having to work through his own darkness while at the same time having to deal with the woman who gave birth to him and abandoned him was very interesting.  And Tsuda-sensei's little extra's through the manga and at the end are always a hoot.<br /><br />Bottom line: another good story in the \\"Kare Kano\\" series, but the lack of honorifics removes something special from the series in my opinion.	2005-03-30

CLAMP is known for their many great titles -- \\"Cardcaptor Sakura\\", \\"Angelic Layer\\", \\"Chobits\\", \\"X\\", \\"Magic Knight Rayearth\\", \\"RG Veda\\", & \\"Miyuki-chan in Wonderland\\" (and I think a few more).  So the four ladies that make up CLAMP came up with an idea.  What if they created a new manga title in which alternate universe versions of their popular characters from other series came together in a massive crossover title?  That idea became \\"Tsubasa\\". At the same time CLAMP created a 2nd new series called \\"xxxHolic\\" in which one of the main characters, the powerful 'space-time witch' Yuuko, would play a supporting cameo role from time to time.<br /><br />The main characters in \\"Tsubasa\\" are Syaoran-kun and Sakura-chan from \\"Cardcaptor Sakura\\".  Sakura is a teenaged princess in the land of Clow and Syaoran is a teenaged boy who is following is father's footsteps as an archaeologist. Both are attracted to each other and have known each other since childhood, but Syaoran feels uncomfortable with the idea of being involved with a princess.  When Sakura's powers mysteriously awakened one evening, she sprouts wings which then disappear taking Sakura's memories and leaving her an unconsious, empty shell. Fearing the worst, the mage Yukito sends Syaoran and Sakura to \\"our world\\" where the powerful space-time witch Yuuko resides.<br /><br />There they are joined by two new characters, the wizard Fai (who created Chi from \\"Chobits\\" in his universe) and the ninja-warrior Kurogane, who serves the Princess Tomoyo in his universe.  Each has a reason to see Yuuko-san and the need to travel.  For a very high price, Yuuko grants their wish, but one of the catches is that they are forced to travel together.<br /><br />Thus Syaoran and his new companions begin their journey to a universe where two main characters from \\"X\\" reside.  There, they must do battle with powerful, seemingly magical street gangs as the look for a feather containing some of Sakura's memories.<br /><br />As to the story, I love the idea of such a massive crossover.  Fortunately, one doesn't have to have read or seen any of CLAMP's other titles to enjoy this because it is new and doesn't base anything on what happened in their other titles.  That said, you will enjoy this more if you know CLAMP's other works.  The story in \\"Tsubasa\\" is interesting and Yuuko's character was so interesting, I had to check out \\"xxxHolic\\" to see more of her.  She's pretty cool.<br /><br />As for Del Rey, when they got into the manga business, I wasn't impressed.  After all, we had enough publishers in the business, most of whom could care less about things like unflipped art (though that's all changed now), Japanese honorifics, Japanese culture, or keeping the translations undomesticated.  TokyoPop had been the only company to remotely show any interest in keeping it real (\\"Fruits Basket\\") and many of their titles (like \\"Chobits\\") had problems.  Further, when Del Rey said they'd be censoring \\"Negima!\\", I just knew this company would be bad and I wasn't going to buy anything from them.<br /><br />However, I was interested in reading \\"Tsubasa\\" because of Syaoran and Sakura.  Someone informed me that the title would be to my liking, meaning it would have all of the Japanese honorifics.  So, I went to the bookstore and saw that this was not only true, but Del Rey's reasons were the ones I'd always argued for keeping them in the English text.  Futher, Del Rey provided the best extras ever I have ever seen in a manga title.  They included a page telling about \\"Cardcaptor Sakura\\".  Then they included a section explaining various characters seen in this volume of \\"Tsubasa\\" and what previous CLAMP series they came from.  Finally, they included translator notes which explained certain Japanese cultural references.<br /><br />As such, Del Rey has immediately become my favorite manga publisher.  Since the story in \\"Tsubasa\\" is interesting, I'll have no troubles buying this series whenever the new volumes are published.<br /><br />Bottom line: CLAMP fans will certainly want to read this title.  Manga fans who like their manga easy to read, yet undomesticated and contain the Japanese honorifics will really appreciate Del Rey's work here.lumes are published. <br /> <br />Bottom line: CLAMP fans will certainly want to read this title.

This may come as a surprise to fans of the anime series who may have been expecting to see Amelia's arrival as seen in the \\"Slayers\\" anime.  But that's not how Hajime-sensei wrote it.  So the story doesn't have Amelia nor Zelgadis in it, which were used in the anime version.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the anime, the story tells of Lina and Gourry's arrival in the city of Atlas.  Two mages are in conflict to lead the local Sorcerer's Guild after the previous leader disappeared.  Tarim, one of the mages looking to take over the guild, looks to hire Lina and Gourry as body guards.  The appearance of the two Mazoku (Seigram and Gio Gaia) ensures that Lina takes the job.  However, as events progress, the disappearance of the former leader of the guild needs investigation and the results could have dire consequences for Lina and Gourry, especially with Mazoku around.<br /><br />There was gore in the novel which obviously didn't show up in the anime.  I was surprised by this for some reason and by the darker feel to this novel.  There were some humor moments, but this is no where nearly as light as the anime put it.  This is not a problem, but I note it to the anime fans.<br /><br />Also, while the principle characters were the same (save the 2nd Mazoku) and the overall elements were the same, the story in the novel plays out much differently to get to a very similar end to the anime.  As such, the novel has more interest in that we don't know how things will get to their ultimate end.  That is a good thing.  However, Lina's great power doesn't come through the novel's pages as well as they do in the anime.  And I found it interesting that Hajime-sensei makes Lina more human in that she experiences fear, something she rarely did in the anime.<br /><br />Bottom line: quite a bit different from the \\"Slayers Next\\" episodes, but a good read nevertheless. \\"Slayers\\" fans will want to read the novel that was the basis of the \\"Slayers Next\\" episodes.ertheless. \\"Slayers\\" fans will want to read the novel that was the basis of the \\"Slayers Next\\" episodes.	2004-12-22

Because I know I'd do something similar in the same situation.<br /><br />Another nice part of \\"Spooner\\" is Ted's classic art style.  Spooner is drawn with elements of Dagwood Boomstead (\\"Blondie\\") in addition to other classic artists.  Yet Ted's style is still very much his own.  In this, we have art that is pleasing to look at and in my book, that always helps me to want to read a comic strip.<br /><br />Bottom line: whether you are newly married, engaged, single, or if you've been married a long time, Ted has written a humorous comic strip book about marriage that almost all will throughly enjoy.	2004-11-22

I was introduced to the \\"Slayers\\" franchise via the three anime TV series.  When I learned that the anime came from a series of novels and short stories by Kanazaka Hajime-sensei, I hoped that someone would translate these into English as it will be a couple of years before I can really read them in Japanese.  My wish has come true.<br /><br />Since the original Japanese novel was much smaller in dimensions, it has more pages.  However, to convert the novel to American size, the number of pages has shrunk and the fonts used are larger than one would normally see in a novel.  This is not a problem, but those wondering why the English version has less total pages will now know why.<br /><br />The story of the novel was covered in \\"Slayers\\" episodes 1-10.  If you've seen the series, you know it deals with Lina, Gourry, and Zelgadis and their dealings with the Red Priest Rezo and the sealed segment of the Dark Lord Ruby Eye Shabranigdo.  It is interesting to see how the anime added and modified things to better suit that format.  If they didn't, they wouldn't have managed to get 10 episodes out of this novel.<br /><br />As to TokyoPop's translations, there were a few disappointments.  First, no Japanese honorifics survive.  Granted they aren't used heavily except by the miko (priestess) and the priests that appear throughout the series.  That would have been nice to have left in (thus making it closer to how the Japanese author intended), but oh well.<br /><br />The second item is a bit more troubling.  It appears that TokyoPop modified certain passages to make it more appealing to younger audiences.  For example, there is a passage where Lina is held captive.  One of her captors decides to make her pay for what she's done to him.  In the original Japanese, I'm told he wants one of his comrades to rape her, but no one is interested for various reasons (this is done for humor effect).  TokyoPop changed rape to kiss.  When the fish creature is given a chance to rape Lina (in the original Japanese), he agrees.<br /><br />This is where TokyoPop's modification of the translation runs into trouble.  The fish creature is waiting for Lina to deposit eggs (which is how fish do their thing) before proceeding.  So that joke falls flat because TokyoPop changed rape to kiss.  Obviously, if the original had been about someone kissing Lina, the fish creature would have just done so rather than wait for her to deposit eggs to be fertilized.  While rape may not be a topic to be used in a gag or joke, it is what the Japanese author wrote and as such, should be in the English translation as well.<br /><br />That aside, I'm still very glad that TokyoPop is bringing the series of novels to us in English.ape Lina (in the original Japanese), he agrees.   <br /> <br />This is where TokyoPop's modification of the translation runs into trouble.

It really is a shame that this book is so hard to get in the US.  \\"Hiragana for Fun\\" is kids book, but if you want a fast and easy way to learn Hiragana, this is the book for you no matter what your age is.  I'm 35 and using this book, it took me about two weeks to completely learn Hiragana.<br /><br />The is designed for the English-speaking public as instructions are all in English.  The only Romaji (English spelling of Japanese) in the book is when an individual Hiragana character is introduced. Basically, it is used to help you pronounce it.  To further assist you learn to properly pronounce the Hiragana letter, an English sentence is used.<br /><br />For example, for the \\"he\\" character, we get the following sentence:<br /><br />\\"Mt. St. HElens is calm today\\"<br /><br />To help you remember the character, the \\"he\\" symbol is incorporated into an image showing a mountain.  Now when you see the \\"he\\" symbol, you think of Mount Saint Helens and automatically remember \\"he\\".  Make sense?  It will, trust me.<br /><br />You are given several practice squares with which to write the character on that page, much as many of us had when we learned the English alphabet.  In addition, four vocabulary in Hiragana using using that character are given.  Granted, if you don't know the other characters, you won't know how to pronounce the word which is a minor weakness of the book.  But the English meaning of the word is given, so I know that \\"hei\\" means \\"fence\\".<br /><br />Once you learn all of the Hiragana, going back and learning reading the vocabulary words is a breeze and good practice.<br /><br />Bottom line: while designed for kids, I found this to be the easiest and quickest way to learn Hiragana.  If you are serious about learning to read and write Hiragana, GET THIS BOOK!	2004-10-20

She calls him \\"Kazuma-chan\\" and they go to the same high school as Arima and Yukino. However, the two of them are getting along so well that one would think they were the newly weds rather than his mother and her father. Kazuma finds himself falling in love with Tsubasa, something he knows shouldn't happen.  She finds herself in love with him as well. However, the call of music is strong and Kazuma must decide which he loves more -- Tsubasa or life with his band.<br /><br />In the first 10-volumes of the manga, TokyoPop decided to remove all of the Japanese honorifics.  I disapprove because \\"Kare Kano\\" is such a Japanese title that removing the honorifics removes something special from the story.  With this volume, TokyoPop has rectified that situation and at least some (if not all) of the honorifics are now included.  I wish all of the manga were this way, but better late than never.<br /><br />In addition to the Tsuda Diary at the end of the manga, TokyoPop has included the first part of an interview with Tsuda-sensei.  I find her remarks in every chapter to be entertaining, and the interview is very insightful in seeing how she became a manga artist.  It is an excellent addition and I'm glad there will be more in the future.<br /><br />Bottom line: Tsubasa fans will appreciate the fact that the whole volume is dedicated to her and Kazuma-kun.  I found this subplot of \\"Kare Kano\\" to be very interesting.  I can't wait to see where Tsuda-sensei takes this.	2004-10-13

We have only two stories in this book.<br />The first story has Banpei requesting Skuld turn the automoton girl into a real girl.  Skuld makes the automoton into a fully functional android.  Sadly, the new android has no interest in Banpei and fights him to keep him at bay but worships Skuld.<br />In the second story, Belldandy loses her power when she fails to renew her license.  Meanwhile Otaki, Tamiya, and the boys dump all of their stuff on Keiichi for storage while their dorm is being worked on.  Skuld comes up with a device to expand the space of the Tea Room which allows them to store the stuff easily.  It accidently expands space to infinity and this space is visited by the giant creature known as Schr&ouml;dinger's Whale.  Before this visit, these creatures were thought to be extinct.<br />Fujishima-sensei continues with the same excellent artwork and a couple of pretty interesting tales.  His character designs are starting to slip when the characters are shown face-front.  They are starting to look a bit odd.  From the side, the characters look fine.  That's the only complaint on the Japanese side of this.<br />On the American side, Dark Horse & Proteus do the standard flip for most the art and no-flip for other panels.  They continue their above-average level of domestication of the stories from the original Japanese, neither of which is surprising.  However, what had me dissappointed is one change from the Japanese.  In the original, Keiichi listens to The Carpenters song \\"Sing\\" and other Carpenters songs.  Instead, we are given \\"Missing Time\\" by Matthew Sweet.  Who's that?  I checked and he's done several CD's but was unknown to me. Unfortunately, the Carpenter's management wanted WAY to much money to reprint the lyrics which is why the change was made.  It is disappointing, but I now understand why Toren Smith had to make that change, and since he got Fujishima-san's permission, that's all that matters.  Many people like the new lyrics better.<br />Bottom line: More OMG fun and worth adding to your collection.ad to make that change, and since he got Fujishima-san's permission, that's all that matters.

Vol. 16: Mystery Child	Books	5	4	5	N	Y	Book 16 -- Enter Welsper (Velsper)	This graphic novel of the popular \\"Oh My Goddess\\" series covers original manga volumes volume 16 chapter 94 through volume 17 chapter 101.  This is an 8-part story covering the \\"Welsper\\" arc (or as Dark Horse calls him, Velsper).<br />The first part has the 4th goddess Peorth losing an aerial with an unknown attacker and attempting to warn Belldandy.  Urd and Skuld are recalled to the heavens to deal with a problem while a young boy who knows Belldandy visits her and Keiichi.  The second part has the boy come by Bell's and Keiichi's shop, then charm their boss Chihiro.  The third part has the boy coming to stay at the Morisato residence.  Belldandy begins to have bizarre dreams and time seems to be going awry.<br />The forth part has Skuld and Urd fighting a corruption in the Yggdrasil system.  Belldandy and the boy have a strange connection and the boy reveals his true nature.  The fifth part has the return of Peorth as she defends Keiichi from attack.  The boy reveals his plan and reason for being on Earth.  The sixth part has Skuld, Urd, and their helpers in the heavens losing their battle against time stoppage while Peorth, Belldandy, and Keiichi make a choice.<br />The seventh part has Belldandy reverting to childhood while the boy's plans begin to go astray.  The final part has Belldandy remember the boy's name which was what he wanted all along.  However, he must now pay the price for tampering with the Yggdrasil system.<br />Bottom line:  The standard great artwork from Fujishima-san is here.  Having Peorth return is a great addition even if her role is limited.  There's not as much humor in this issue, but we do learn a lot more about the heavens and get to see Demon Central for the first time.  There is one complaint which I've never made before.  Since Dark Horse converts these comics from their original Japanese form (which is a right-to-left format), nearly everything you see is the reverse image of the original.

This graphic novel covers the original Japanese manga Vol. 7 Ch. 45-47 & Vol. 8 Ch. 48-49.  Chapter 45-46 is the Mara arc and chapters 48 & 49 are solo tales.<br />The first part of the Mara arc has her return to Earth where she possesses Megumi.  She unleashes Senbei, who is a genie-demon of poverty and disaster, upon Keiichi and company.  The second part of the Mara arc has Skuld create the anti-Mara robot Banpei which works a little too well.  The third part has Urd being recalled to the heavens and Mara intends to make sure she leaves for good.<br />The next story has the Nekomi Tech Motor Club on a retreat to a lodge where a shinnentai (manifestation of will) lives.  She seems to know Keiichi and is determined to make him fulfill a promise made in 1930!  The final story has Belldandy teaching Sora on the art of making boxed lunches while Urd attempts to play matchmaker.<br />Bottom line: As one might expect from this series, the artwork is great.  The stories are light for the most part with the latter two being more humorous.  Great for a quick read before going to bed.	2003-06-01

Now in the form of a young girl, Urd befriends a young boy.  The fourth story has the goddesses restored but Urd feeling the need to repay Keiichi for all he has done.  It is time for another one of her love potions to help Belldandy and Keiichi \\"get it on\\".<br />The final tale has Belldandy knitting a sweater for Keiichi while Sayoko plots her downfall.<br />Bottom line: this book sees a return to the classic OMG humor that was missed in the previous book.

The second part has Urd showing her demonic mastery over Mara, then destroying the Morisato residence depsite the defence of Belldandy and Skuld.<br />The third part has Urd starting the Ultimate Destruction Program (UDP) to destroy everything while Belldandy unleashes her full powers.  The fourth section has Urd summoning Fenrir who becomes the UDP while the goddesses summon Midgard to defeat the giant wolf.  The fifth part has Urd free from evil but powerless while the UDP transfers itself first to Midgard, then to Keiichi. The final part has Keiichi possessed by the UDP and forcing Skuld to build a device to help it destroy the world while Belldandy makes a choice.<br />The humor level in this book is much lower than in previous OMG manga, but this story is very interesting & well written.  It is cool seeing Belldandy unleashed (within limits).<br />Bottom line: Certainly this is the best volume to this point in the series despite the limited humor factor.  OMG fans will have to have this.  Fans of comic arts should appreciate this.  Those looking for a fairly wholesome, light reading material shouldn't overlook this title.

Then in the second story, Mara goes after Keiichi's sister Megumi and turns her into a car but comes loses her memory when she touches a good luck arrow.  Now she can't remember how to undo her spell. The third tale has Belldandy racing for the Nekomi Tech Motor Club.  Aoshima is determined to end NTM forever and tries to sabotoge her vehicle.<br />The fourth tale is the funniest as Urd uses Valentine's Day to con Belldandy into making Keiichi a chocolate (in Japan, women give men Chocolate on Valentine's Day and the men return the favor a month later; homemade chocolate is considered a sign of love as I understand it). Mara gets wind of this and makes a special poison chocolate while Urd makes a special love chocolate to replace Belldandy's.<br />The final tale introduces us to the third goddess Skuld.  She's youngest sister of Belldandy and Urd and has come to Earth because of the bug problem.  Fans of the OAV series will recoginze this story though its ending is very different from the OAV.<br />Bottom line: Fans of the OAV series or the movie will want to have this in their collection.

Belldandy discovers a buried Shinden experimental plane from WWII which the club must repair in time for the school festival.<br />The fourth tale has one of Urd's love potions backfiring on her with humorous results.  The final tale is a longer one and introduces us to the demon Mara.  Mara is out to prevent Urd and Belldandy from doing as they please on Earth and her target is Keiichi.<br />Bottom line: Another good graphic novel that is a must-have for OMG fans.

The 2nd story centers around Keiichi's desire to buy Belldandy a ring (OAV viewers will recognize this story). The third tale is about Belldandy and Keiichi's date at a fancy restaurant where Urd and Sayoko also decide to go to.<br />The fourth story takes place at the Morisato (Keiichi) residence with various people coming by for a New Years party where Urd pulls out a special game of \\"Life\\".

The first deals with Keiichi's sister Megumi's attempt to find a nice but cheap place to live near Nekomi Tech.  The second tale is about Belldandy's self-appointed human rival Sayoko and her attempt to embarrass Belldandy conning her and Keiichi to pose nude for Sayoko's art club.<br />The third tale is the best as this shows Belldandy's and Keiichi's first date.  Very sweet (and a glimps of this is seen in the OAV's opening animation)!  The fourth tale centers around a motorcycle race Nekomi Tech Motor Club is in with Keiichi as the racer.  The fifth tale has the Motor Club and Art Club joining forces to share a large beach house where Sayoko again attempts to score a victory against Belldandy.<br />Finally, the last tale has the introduction of Belldandy's elder sister Urd.  Urd has been watching the couple for a long time and feels it is time for things to heat up between Belldandy and Keiichi.<br />Bottom line: The artwork is still in its early stages so it doesn't have the \\"kawaii\\" (cute) factor of the OAV series or the \\"Ah!

The first deals with Keiichi's sister Megumi and her racing a motorcycle lady known simply as \\"The Queen\\".  The second tale deals with Belldandy's older sister Urd and Urd's loss of her angel World of Elegance.  BTW, that's Urd and her angel on the book's cover.<br />The third tale deals with Belldandy getting drunk off of cola and casting a spell which causes her and Keiichi to have to hold hands continually (much to her younger sister Skuld's dismay).  And finally, the fourth tale deals with the robot Banpei falling in love with an automoton.  Skuld must deal with the fact that her creation has grown beyond his original programming.<br />Bottom line:  Some light-hearted tales with Urd and Skuld growing somewhat.

However, because the series was so short, I went online to see if there was a manga (Japanese comic book) series since most anime is from manga.<br />Enter \\"Wrong Number\\" done by Dark Horse Comics.  This should replace the \\"555-Goddess\\" book previously done since this contains the chapters that were not included in that original book 1.  People who've watched the OAV's will see the major elements from the first and second videos done in this book.  However, there are notable differences such as a monk that lived in the temple that Belldandy and Keiichi end up living in.  We are introduced to the following characters:<br />Keiichi (the guy with the wish), Belldandy (the goddess), Tamiya (large classmate), Aoyama (cool classmate), Sayoko (the girl jealous of Belldandy), and Megumi (Keiichi's sister).<br />One thing people who've seen the OAV will be surprised at is the art.  Belldandy doesn't look like she does in the OAV.  Much like many other comic strips or comic books, Fujuishima-san had not yet refined the artwork.  Don't worry, the artwork gets better with each volume.<br />Story-wise, this volume mainly focuses on Keiichi and Belldandy getting to know each other and their life at college.<br />Bottom line:  If you loved the \\"Oh My Goddess\\" DVD set, you will REALLY enjoy this manga and all of the manga's in this series.  If you've never seen the OAV's but want wholesome, light reading material, get this book!	2003-02-06

There are NO Sunday strips included, only the Monday through Saturday daily strips.  But, since Frank never had his Sunday strips included in his serials, they aren't really required.<br />For those who are unaware of \\"Liberty Meadows\\", this is a strip about the Liberty Meadows Animal Sanctuary.  Here, several crazy animals live including a rescued midget circus bear, a LARGE frog, a hog who used to be a mascot for the University of Maryland, and other critters.  You also have the shy, nerdy vet Frank, and the hot animal psychiatrist Brandy (whom Frank has a HUGE crush on but who can't seem to bring himself to ask her out).  The artwork is VERY good and the humor is good but may not be for everyone.  Frank Cho does a lot of parody in his strips and some of that may go over people's head.<br />There are a few things that set this book apart from other comic strip books.  The first being the paper this is printed on. This is high-gloss, heavy paper which is very nice!  Second, Frank has included some new material at the beginning of the book in which a very old Ralph and Leslie are visited by someone who wants to interview them about their days at Liberty Meadows Animal Sanctuary.  From there, we are launched into the classic comic strips.<br />At the end of the book, Frank has graciously included several drawings from his sketchbook as well as the cover art from the various comic books (the strip went to comic book format after leaving syndication).<br />This is a great addition to anyones comic strip book collection.	2002-11-08

While this is the 4th Dilbert book, it is the 2nd book of strips from the newspaper, following &quot;Always Postpone Meetings With Time-Wasting Mornons&quot;.  The strips in this book are from the end of 1989 through mid-1990.  Some characters of note introduced in this book are the Garbage Man (who is a member of MENSA) and Ratbert.  Also, the famous fictional country of Elbonia makes it's first appearance.  People will see characters that look a lot like Wally but aren't called that as Wally wasn't established yet.  The humor picks up with more business related strips and the artwork tightens up a bit.  A good book for laughs and light reading.	2002-08-19

This book covers strips from May 19, 1991 to December 13, 1992.  The Boss begins to take the form we are familar with (the pointy hair starts) and Wally comes into existance.  Alice also begins to take form in this book.  One of my favorite characters (and one whom Scott Adams has used rarely) is Zimbu the monkey and he shows up here as well.  The strip continues to improve in the pages of this book.  Great for light reading or a good laugh.	2002-08-19

In this strip, Robotman comes to Earth, meets Oscar Milde, and then lives with the Milde family.  Included in this family are the parents and Oscar's brother Gary.  The strips in this book run from February 18, 1985 to December 7, 1985.  There are no Sunday strips included in the book and the book's size is the same as the standard \\"Garfield\\" books.<br />Those who are unfamilar with the original \\"Robotman\\" should get this book (if you can find it) just to see how the strip has evolved.  People who remember this classic strip should get the book just to recall the good old days.  Bottom line, get the book!	2002-08-14

This strip came to my attention when Jonathan first started it and asked me to throw him a link (my site being all about comic strips).  \\"Goats\\" is a surreal strip about two male best friends Jon and Philip, their talking pet goat Toothgnip, and their evil talking pet chicken Diablo.  There are also aliens, beer, women, beer, dwarves, beer, zombies, beer, and more beer.<br />This book is the first \\"Goats\\" book despite the fact that it is called \\"Volume 4\\".  However, Jonathan has promised to follow George Lucas's footsteps and release the prequels soon (\\"Volume 3\\" will be out soon).  This book covers strips from January 2000 to December 2000.  The significant event of this book is that Jon (who is a loser when it comes to women) finally gets a girlfriend named Megan.  She's a hottie and totally with it that makes you wonder if it isn't pity love.  Ah, but if it weren't for pity, many of us would be in a world of hurt!<br />Bottom line, this is a pretty funny comic strip but it is NOT for the kids (in my opinion).  The humor and content can often shift into the \\"R\\" range so you've been warned.  Otherwise, get this book and help a web cartoonist!	2002-08-14

Having said that, be warned that this isn't a book it you are trying to learn Unix from scratch.  However, this is THE bible for Unix users.  Even beginners will benefit from owning this book (I did when I started).<br />The reason this book is so great is that it contains all of the various Unix commands including those for the various shells (Korn Shell, C Shell, Bourne Shell).  Various editors (VI, sed, ex, emacs), awk, macros, tracers, SCCS, RCS, and much more are included here so no matter what you do in Unix, you'll have the commands to use it.  Also included is an Obsolete Command section.  These are commands which current versions of Unix no longer use but older versions would (obviously).<br />Intermediate and advanced Unix users benefit the most from this book.  Sure, you could use the Unix \\"man\\" command to get the online manual, but if you are like me, you like having a book to consult.  Beginners will benefit from this book as it gives the user a look at the depth of Unix and a source to look up commands.  Since the book doesn't contain a lot of examples, beginners may find this troubling.  However, as they learn, the book will become of greater value.<br />Bottom line, all Unix users should get this book!  It is a must have and you are only short-changing yourself if you don't have it on your bookshelf.	2002-08-13

Snorkel, she's loud, overweight, and has a pet.  While Snorkel has Otto the dog, Lugg has Bella.  While I give Mort Walker credit for doing things to breathe new life into his comic strip, I find her to be mostly annoying, though not as annoying as a character added in the 90's.

This is an American soldier of Japanese decent.  He's not a very funny character and many will find that the jokes with him are very topical and don't carry well today.

This book is actually two books: \\"G.O. Fizzickle Pogo\\" and \\"Positively Pogo\\".  For those who don't know, \\"Pogo\\" is an animal-only comic strip with very well drawn artwork with good humor and stories to boot.  Walt Kelly does his strip like a river as it meanders down stream.  Sometimes the strip will follow a couple of storylines but often those stories get merged back together.  Set in the deep south, there are lots of interesting characters here which make this strip a lot of fun.<br />\\"Positively Pogo\\" are comic strips from around 1954 first published in newspapers.  This part starts with the start of the television media with various characters doing things to break into commercials and shows.  The strip then meanders into a plan by Churchy (the turtle) to make money by making money.  We have a long appearance by a non-regular character (in the form of a pig) which just happens to look like a certain Soviet leader of the time (part of Kelly's political humor). The book then ends with the Olympics in Australia.<br />\\"G.O. Fizzickle Pogo\\" contains strips from around 1956.  This book starts with the announcement of the International Geophysical Year which is 18 months long.  After a while, we are introduced to \\"the flea\\" who loves the dog character Beauregard.  Upon being rejected, Howland Owl puts a plan into motion to launch the flea into space (in light of the Sputnik launch).  This leads to a long stretch where Albert decides to defend the moon from strangers (egro the Soviets) landing there.  The book then continues into a discussion on the then new Suez Canal with some of the characters deciding to build their own canal.  The book ends with the removal of a \\"demon\\" from Albert.<br />Unlike later Pogo strips, this book is lighter on the political strips (they are there, just not as in your face) which makes these better in my opinion.  As to this book, it would have been nice if the two books could have been sequencial (meaning the strips in book two pick up immediately where book one ended) but I don't know if the strips in between were ever published in book form.  Worth having if you like good, classic comic strips.uld have been sequencial (meaning the strips in book two pick up immediately where book one ended) but I don't know if the strips in between were ever published in book form.

There are also a few pages of text where Doug writes about Faux Bubba's and his thoughts/accounts of the '92 election (including his meeting with Bill Clinton). While it's obvious that Doug voted for Clinton and is left-of-center in his political views, the strips are mostly funny and mostly told from a southerner's prospective.	2002-07-06

Awesome!  Fast forward to my high school years.  I was bored and killing study hall time in the library when I stumbled upon this book.<br />The book is broken down by period going back to the first comic strips and working their way up to the early 70's.  There's some text where the authors write to explain the different styles or comment on various strips but the real gem here are all of the comic strip samples in this book.  Some strips (like Mickey Mouse) get many pages as they tell a whole story.  Others don't get but a single sample strip, especially strips after the 1950's.<br />I love this book and will break it out from time-to-time just to read all of the classic strips like \\"Yellow Kid\\", \\"Buster Brown\\", \\"Katzenjammer Kids\\", \\"Mutt and Jeff\\", \\"Little Nemo in Slumberland\\", \\"Thimble Theater\\", \\"Mickey Mouse\\", \\"Krazy Kat\\", and many, many more.<br />It's a shame this book hasn't been re-published with new sections to include modern classics but oh well.

To Alfred's horror, these  Sartan practice the forbidden art of Necromancy.  While Haplo is repulsed,  he intends to tell his lord about this art.<br />However things start to go  awry when the lazar (undead who know they are undead) start multiplying  with one purpose...to kill all living things.  The lazar now control all  the undead and the living are on the run for their lives.  It is here that  Alfred shows himself to be more powerful than he let on as he 'kills' an  undead...making the corpse unable to be raised again.  This comes as a  great shock to all but Alfred claims not to remember how he did it.<br />As  they run for their lives, Alfred leads them to ancient an Sartan section  where he, Haplo, and a friendly necromancer learn more about the ancient  Sartan and are shown the possible exsistance of a higher power than the  Sartan and Patryn.  The friendly necromancer is killed but when he is  raised as a lazar, he now has the power to 'kill' the undead and this he  begings to do which turns the tide.  Haplo and Alfred escape and Haplo  allows Alfred to escape rather than deal with Haplo's lord.<br />This by far  is the darkest book in the series with the undead and the way these Sartan  blindly destroy themselves by continually raising the dead (as undead).

Haplo is rescued by a human, elf, and dwarf child who are captives  of the powerful and mysterious Dragon-Snakes.<br />As Haplo learns the truth  about the Dragon-Snakes, Alfred learns the truth behind the Sundering.  The  Dragon-Snakes lead Haplo, the humans, elves, and dwarves to the Sartan and  the Sartan leader reacts by threatening to destroy these 'invaders.' As the  Dragon-Snakes flood the Sartan city with the rune magic negating ocean  water, the leader of the Sartan opens the Death Gate and allows the  Dragon-Snakes into the other realms.<br />This book makes it clear that not  all Sartan are good and not all Patryn are evil.  Learning more about the  past and the fight over whether God (the higher power) really exist proves  more interesting than I've made it sound.  Fear and arrogance seems to rule  both the Patryn leader and the Sartan leader.  An excellent read!exist proves  more interesting than I've made it sound.  Fear and arrogance seems to rule  both the Patryn leader and the Sartan leader.  An excellent read!	2000-06-26
US	52781385	R3E365JAFZ238	0553290983	371462393	Elven Star (The Death Gate Cycle, Volume 2)	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Slow Beginings; Faster Ending	This is the 2nd book of the Death Gate Cycle and has only one returning character from the first book &quot;Dragon Wing&quot; : the Patryn Haplo. The book starts out slow as we are introduced to the Realm of Fire, Pryan.  This world stays lit constantly which has made the surface a massive jungle  so high that only dwarves have ever seen the ground.  The story starts  with our introduction to an elf family who are in the weapons business.  As  the best in the trade, they are the richest in the land.  They are selling  a new shipment of magic weapons to a pair of human traders/smugglers who in  turn are smuggling them to the dwarves.  The dwarves are worried due to  rumors that mythical Tytans are on the move and destroying everything in  their path.<br />It is into this scene that Zifnab (Fizban for those who've  read the Dragonlance series) makes a grand entrance fighting to control a  huge dragon.  After gaining control of the dragon, he predicts Haplo's  coming and that the Patryn will be their savior.<br />So when Haplo does show  up, he is surprised to see he has been expected and his arrival is none to  soon.  The mythical Tytans have proved to be all to real and are destroying  everything in their path.  Much to Haplo's surprise, these Tytans know  crude Sartan magic which they use with the force of a mountain and nearly  kill Haplo. Haplo and a few survivors barely escape with there lives and  make for one of the &quot;stars&quot; in the sky.  It is here that Haplo  learns about the creation of the Tytans but is no closer to learning what  happened to his enemies, the Sartans.<br />Learning about the political  situation of Pryan is a tad slow in the begining but Zifnab makes great  comic relief and the Tytans make for an interesting creature that (IMO)  helps speed the book along.  This book continues to slowly show us that  Haplo is not pure evil just because he's a Patryn.  All-in-all an excellent  read!	2000-06-26

Reading the horrid things done to our POW's would make me ill at times but it also gave me an even greater respect for the people who served  in the Vietnam War.  Our POW's went through a lot and if you'd like to  experience that first hand, read this book!	2000-06-21
US	52781385	R1SV6TY2U9JPZO	0553286390	591086816	Dragon Wing (The Death Gate Cycle, Book 1)	Books	5	26	30	N	N	Book 1 of 7 in the Death Gate Cycle	Margret Weis and Tracy Hickman have done it again with this excellent start to the Deathgate Cycle series.  We are introduced to the usual species...humans, elves, and dwarves (called Gegs). However centuries ago,  a human race known as the Sartan sundered the world into four sections  (earth, fire, air, and water) to prevent their ancient enemies the Patryns  (another human race) from ruling the world.  The Sartan then sent the  Patryn into a special prison known as the Labyrinth.  The Sartan hoped to  teach them the errors of their ways as the Patryn slowly made their way to  the Labyrinth's exit.  Then the Sartan went about to set up the new worlds  they created but before they could finish, they all just  vanished.<br />&quot;Dragon Wing&quot; takes place on the world of air known  as Arianus.  Land masses float in various orbits in the air in one of three  realms...the Low Realm (occupied by the Gegs), the Mid Realm (occupied by  Elves and Humans), and the High Realm (occupied by the powerful human  wizards known as Mysteriarchs).<br />After many centuries, the Patryn have  begun to escape the Labyrinth (which after the dissappearance of the Sartan  became alive and evil) and are looking for revenge.  Haplo is dispactched  through the discovered Death Gate into this realm of air to learn  everything he can about it and if there are any Sartan present there. While  here, he encounters an interesting variety of characters including the  human assassin Hugh the Hand, the strange and clumsy human Alfred, the  curious Geg Limbeck, the mysterious child Prince Bane, and the powerful  mysteriarch Sinistrad.<br />This is a well written book and an exciting entry  into the strange new fantasy world created by Weis and Hickman.  They  successfully take fantasy writing to a new level here and while this book  answers a few questions, it raises many more.  I recommend this book to  fans of Wies and Hickman, Tolkien, and fantasy.	2000-06-21

Oh sure I would read sections dealing with Balrogs, Galadriel, the Istari, Sauron, and the like but as many who've read this book know, it's hard to read.  Therefor  may I suggest to those of you who want to know what lies within The  Silmarillion but have a hard time reading it, GET THIS UNABRIDGED AUDIO  VERSION!<br />Martin Shaw reads this book and he does an outstanding job!  Not only does he have an excellent reading voice, but his narrating style  flows so well that Tolkien's work springs to life within the mind's eye!  Of course anyone who can breeze through all of the elvish and drarfish  names as easily as Martin does deserves some praise!  Whether you get this  on CD or cassette, you can't go wrong with this reading of The  Silmarillion!	2000-06-10

Tolkien's Celebrated Trilogy: The Lord of the Rings	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Not The Best Audio of LOTR	This is a good audio dramatization of LOTR but not the best.  The production value is not as good and the voice actors are not as convincing in their characters.  Also, many voice actors have to perform other  character roles which can be confusing to the uninitiated.  The Tom  Bombadil (sp) story is picked up in this 24-part (12 hour) audio tale but  many minor details are sacrificed.  This leads to unfortunate references by  characters to events which are skipped when the actually happened.  All in  all not a bad thing (I own it and still listen to it) but the other LOTR  audio (done by the BBC I think) is better done.	2000-06-10

There are two audio dramatizations of the Tolkien classic -- this one and the one done by The Mind's Eye.  This one is the better of the two IMO.  Done in thirteen parts on 13 cassettes (each cassette roughly 45 minutes to  an hour long), this British production is well produced!<br />The voice actors  were well picked and do an excellent job of bringing characters like  Gandalf, Frodo, Stider, Sam, etc. to life!  One of the nice things is that  plenty of voice actors were hired and if one did more than one voice, it  was not noticable.<br />Those who know TOTR very well will miss parts like  the entire Tom Bombadil (sp) story as well as some other minor cuts.  However the edits are done in such a way that one who's never read LOTR  will not know something was missing!<br />I HIGHLY recomend this audio  collection not only for long road trips, but for home or work.  I know I  entertained many a co-worker by bringing this collection in and playing it.  You can't go wrong buying this one!	2000-06-10

Not only does this Bible have cross-referencing,  it has a good glossary, multiple indexes, tables, concordinace, outlines,  and tons more.  Great for preachers or for beginers trying to learn.  I'm  trying to get the book back into print but it will take some time.	2000-01-03

These strips are done in comic book fashion rather than the normal comic strip fashion (meaning they tell  little, humorous stories).  A fine addition to any Beetle Bailey fan's  collection!	1999-12-28

I was a young teenager when the local public radio station began to play J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.  Since we could not afford a TV listening to audio adaptations of classic books on the radio had to do.<br />I  recall being spellbound as I listened eagerly every week for the next  installment of this masterpiece.  The BBC did an outstanding job in  casting the voices of the various characters.  The sound effects added are  well done and while this is an abridged version of the novels, they stay  true to the Tolkien story.  Characters say exactly the same things as they  do in the novels!<br />I highly recomend this collection to anyone who loves  Tolkien or for anyone who buys audio books for those long road trips!	1999-12-24

The first time I read 'Iron Coffins', it was for a term paper in high school.  At that point, all Germans in WWII were evil Nazi stooges with the mental capacity of a slug in salt.  Once I started reading Mr.  Werner's excellent book, I actually found myself sharing in the excitement  as a U-Boat sank Allied ships.  I also found myself feeling the dread as  Allied escort ships dropped thier deadly depth charges.  Iron Coffins is  a fast paced book that is hard to put down.  One is able to truely  experience what the war was like through Mr. Werner's eyes.  Once you've  finished, your understand something...that just because you are at war with  an evil nation doesn't make it's people all evil.  Mr. Werner may not have  been a celebrated U-Boat commander, but if it weren't for him, we would  never truely understand the meaning of the term 'Iron Coffin.'	1999-03-22
