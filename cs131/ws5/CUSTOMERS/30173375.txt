I have been on the zone diet for about ten years now.  My bodyfat stays between 4-8%.  I can put together a Zone favorable meal in my sleep, with little effort.  I rarely get cravings.  All of my blood work is outstanding.  I never crash midday the way I used to on carb diets, unless I don't get enough sleep.  Truthfully, most of my life I ate enormous quantities of food and never gained weight, until I hit 30.  I realized my old eaing habits would cost me as i got older.  Fact is, I learned to eat from this book and have no doubt I will be on this diet the rest of my life.    The other side is that it wasn't easy at first.  You have to be a bit obsessive about measuring and weighing-at least in the beginning until you learn to estimate.  Your lifestyle may take a turn for the worse, as you won't be able to simply sit down and eat to be sociable like you are used to.  I had horrible cravings periodically for the first few years.  These went away in time, partly as I got more flexible in my eating.  That comes from experience with the diet.    I have helped many people over the years change their eating habits to a more Zone favorable approach.  My suggestion  is to try to stick to this diet to the letter for the first 3 months to a year. Then you can start adapting it to you rown needs.  Just understanding the role of the different macronutrients and the makeup of a good meal will help you.  Eventually you might want to just use this knowledge as a guidline for eating, rather than being as strict as us Zone fanatics.	2005-08-06

This is not a book of step by step instruction for drawing or painting objects.  Instead, each chapter is given to a different artist to explain their materials and methods in pen and watercolor sketching.<br /><br />I appreciated the way each artist listed the materials that make up their sketch kit, from the type of pen to the paper, usually accompanied by a photograph of the whole thing.  The artist then goes on to explain their approach, accompanied by numerous illustrations and pictures.  There are so many different approaches covered here that you are sure to find some inspiration for your own work.<br /><br />The works displayed in this book are outstanding.  While some artists here use the sketch to prepare for a painting, many have the sketch as a final goal.  I personally get much more enjoyment out of looking at sketches than at finished works.<br /><br />If you use a sketchbook, watercolors or pens i can't recommend this highly enough.	2005-08-06

The base of this dictionary is not words but phrases.  This is more important for learning Russian than for the Romance or Germanic languages.  The latter can seem to have a plug and play quality to them, since they are closely related to English.  Through the Russian language however, the ways of thinking and expressing a concept are far from English or most western European languages.   <br /> <br />A necessity in my opinion.	2005-08-06

Hamsun as always combines his sharp perceptual powers with honesty and humor.  I was surprised how favorably Hamsun wrote of the mountain people, both Muslims and Christians.  He seemed taken with the landscape and the way these people dealt with the harshness of life in this area, their fitness and fatalism.  Along the way, Hamsun encounters conmen, police, armed villagers, beggars, oil drillers, peasants and nobles.   <br /> <br />This is especially interesting reading given the importance this region now has geopolitically.  Altogether, a fascinating bit of travel writing, worthwhile for Hamsun lovers and anyone looking for an easy adventure travel read.	2005-07-31

Many of the same issues facing the sport today were dealt with by the ancients. <br /> <br />More important perhaps is what is revealed regarding the importance and effectiveness of combat sports outside the competitive arena.  Poliakoff quotes Homer, Alexander and others to make the point that boxing, wrestling and pankration may not be so effective in producing an effective warrior.  Alexander, for instance, didn't approve of boxing and wrestling but did favor stick fighting.  Champion athletes in the Iliad are cowardly in battle.  The Romans blame the Greek love of \\"games\\" on their decline. <br /> <br />Scholarly, readable, relevant.	2005-07-28

Still, he had much to say as well as much influence on academia today.  He is therefore worth getting to know.  Rather then wade through several hundred pages of the deliberately (imo) opaque text in Being and Time, as I mistakenly did, this would be a nice start. <br /> <br />Truth is, Heidegger's ideas are not all that complex, it is his language that gives the appearence of difficult thought.  Inwood clarifies but succeeds in avoiding over simplification. Still, I believe someone could do an even better job of presenting Heidegger's thought to the average reader. <br /> <br />Definitely recommended over any of those cartoon books on Heidegger which are not only too simple, but extremely dishonest and innacurate.	2005-07-28

The authors make an analogy between what they are trying to accomplish in this book, with an English teacher who first lets his students hear a poem read, before analyzing it technically.  This analogy holds up to a point, but not completely.  In some ways, the conceptual, no pain approach to calculus presented here is more like an English teacher reading an English languge poem to a bunch of students who can't understand English.   <br /> <br />The language of math is still, and always will be numbers.  I was left wondering about too may concepts because the real work, the math, was left out in many instances.  After reading this book, I went through a more mathematically oriented book oncalculus, suffered with the number crunching, and came to a better understanding of the calculus.  No pain, no gain is true in this case. <br /> <br />I also didn't like the way the book was organized with all the chapters running together. More section breaks would have helped. <br /> <br />On the up side, the authors had a difficult job, and did an admirable job.  I did indeed come away learning something.  Part of the problem I had with this book was probably that I wasn't using it as a supplement to a normal calculus textbook in a normal calc course, but rather was using it for self-study on its own.  If you are currently enrolled in a calc course or have previously taken the subject, you might feel better about this book.	2005-07-28

The card order follows the order in the books exactly.  What the books give you are instrucion in and ample opportunity to practice writing the characters. Also, the book is in larger type, and easier to learn from at first.   <br /> <br />It is true that these do not have the stroke order on the cards, but they are flash cards and I wouldn't expect to use them  to practice writing, but rather for character recognition.   <br /> <br />I haven't seen the other competing set of cards, but I am very happy with these.  The characters are in simplified form, but the traditional form is shown where differences exist.  The physical quality is excellent as well.	2005-07-28

I would like to add that for those interested in a general history that gives decent accounts of the battles, this is the book to get.  Parker's book, while probably more up to date andthoroughly researched is not up to the task when it comes to detailing the fighting.   <br /> <br />I can't give it five stars as it is a bit outdated and so much new research has been published since.

Ivan was brilliant, cruel, and at times cowardly, and all his sides are exposed here.  There is much information on his Oprichniki and the horror they brought to the land.  The endless campaigns, fought on all sides of the Russian border against Poland, Sweden, Tartars, and Ottomans are given brief but solid treatment.  The seige of Pskov, the burning of moscow, the battles with the tartars all make for thrilling reading.  Of equal interest are Ivan's theological debates with foreigners, where he clearly shows his intelligence and learning.   Ivan's penchant for torture is shown and requires a strong stomach to read.  Lets not forget the conquest of Siberia and so many other things happening at this time.  Bobrick has managed to fit so much in one volume, with hardly a wasted word.  Great book.	2005-07-21

Voltaire has left us an account of a great general that is never dry, always entertaining, and honest.  While Voltaire gives Charles his due as a charismatic leader and great general, he seems to have written this book more as a vehicle to expose the King's dark side.  Charles waged war for war's sake and is not glorified here as might be the tendency among other writers. Charles was among the most daring, colorful and skillful military leaders ever to take to the field.  He was also a reckless, thoughtless, war monger who inherited one of the most powerful countries on earth at the time and in a few years, lost it.  His selfish ambitions also cost the Swedish people dearly in lives. <br /> <br />Altogether, a fine entertaining, informative, and instructional read.	2005-07-21

It is about what people sketch, how and why.  When I began sketching I lacked confidence simply because I wasn't sure about the correct method, amount of detail materials, etc.  This book showed me the wide variety of sketching styles and that sketching is such a personal activity done for so many different reasons that there is no right or wrong way.  There is of course good and bad sketching but your the style you choose is your own.  No matter what medium you work or what your subject, I recommend this book as part instructional, part insprational.	2005-07-21

He writes with the fervid delicate beauty of a butterfly defying the storms of wind\\".  Perhaps that quote says it all.  Yes , it is a beautiful book in its own way, but that torturous, flowery style of writing was swept away by the modernist tide long ago.  Who has time for it?<br /><br />This book often appears on lists of the \\"worst written books ever\\", next to the works of Bulwer-Lytton.  I can understand why.  When I first picked it up I couldn't get past the first two pages.  Pater goes on and on and goes nowhere.  For the next four days I tried many times to read it, each time I just groaned a few pages in and tossed the book aside.  It wan't till the end of the week that I finally got the hang of Pater's style.  I eventually finished the book and was glad I did because I really did enjoy the story and also because of the fact that I was finished with it.  Mixed feelings.<br /><br />If you enjoy the decorative style of this era , then by all means buy this book.  Avoid otherwise.	2005-07-21

Our lack of knoweldge here is probably due two reasons.  First, Tamerlane barely touched the Christian west, prefering instead to pick on the asian and middle eastern Muslim peoples, therefore having little effect on the modern west directly.  Second, Tamerlane was a comqueror, not an empire builder.  He simply annhilated his foes and left.  His destruction of the Ottomans meant little as he allowed them to regroup and later regain their power. <br /> <br />David Nicolle's books often seem to focus heavily on archaeological evidence.  In this case it is probably a neccesity.  There is much focus on surviving examples helmets, armour and weapons.  My knowledge of the eastern types of armour was strengthened from reading this book. <br /> <br />One fact that struck me after taking in the whole of Timur's campaigns is how ridiculous it sounds for critics to blame Christianity and Europe, usually the Crusades, for the sad state of the Muslim world.  Take a look at the destruction Timur brought the Muslim lands.  Major cities and cultural centers were sacked repeatedly. Untold numbers were slaughtered.  This is most likely what set Islam back.  Comparing the crusades to Tamerlane' conquests is like comparing a flea bite to nuke. <br /> <br />I am not Angus McBrides biggest fan, but I enjoyed his work here.  The plates of Timur in his early years as well as the cover plate are outstanding.  Wargamers and miniature painters will love this book. <br /> <br />Buy if you have any interest in the period.	2005-07-20

The focus here is on a social level.  The life of the soldier and his day to day existence in the camp, the songs, poetry and literature that developed around the war, and interaction-usually violent-between peasant and soldier.  Much of this book is quite sad as it reveals the harshness and cruelty of life in this time made more miserable by endless war.  The book is filled with contemporary prints as well as museum photos of a artifacts from the period.      Military history buffs might also find the section on the Tyrolean peasant rebellion of interest.  I have come across no other English language source that gives as much info on this sub-conflict.	2005-07-20

Perhaps the most unjustly neglected philosopher in the western world.  I would hope this very readable introduction will encourage more people to take up the study of this great thinker.  Bryan Magee, as usual does, what many professional philosphers are unable or unwilling to do: he makes philosophy accessible to almost everyone.

If you know the animal, you can draw him from any angle or position with or without a live example.  This is true even in quick gestures.  As a result he offers no shortcuts and no formulae, just a sound, understandable method by which you can construct anything.    Weatherly backs up what he says with hundreds of beautiful, lively examples using many different mediums and in many different styles.  The idea is not to copy his drawings, but to see the possibilities.      I also enjoyed Jack Hamm's book, but I will say that this one wins easily.  Hamm's is more of a formulae book, showing you exactly how to draw this or that animal in a particular pose.  This may be comforting for early beginners, but it won't lead you close to true mastery.  Also, the difference in method between Hamm and Weatherly clearly produces different finished products.  Weatherly's animals are enfused with life and action, while Hamm's seem more static in comparision.  This is the result of Weatherly's laying down action lines before constructing the figure.    A definite must for drawing animals or any form of life	2005-07-20

As a dance instructor, not a fitness instructor, he is well aware of the finer points of human performance that are often overlooked by a society so focused on speed and strength.  I would recommend this book for two groups of people.  One is those studying anatomy.  By going through the exercises, the major muscles and bones of the body can be learned on deeper and more useful level than simply by studying them in a book.  Experiential learning is best in this case.  Second, those with a strong ability to visualize, which doesn't include everyone.  Alignment through visualization can be adifficult skill to learn.

Farber has a lifetime of experience learning languages succesfully and his advice should be considered.  Two things he was right on about:  First, that you should seek out a native speaker and start speaking the target language.  You can not learn a language on your own.  Better would be to visit the country where the language is spoken, refuse to speak any English, and immerse yourself in real world situations.  A 10 second exchange with a native in the target language is worth perhaps 3 hours of studying.  I know from experience.  Second, the multi-track approach works, because no one method is sufficient by itself.  All have weaknesses. <br /> <br />The biggest mistake anyone can make is thinking that formal study will teach them to speak a language.  It is only preparation for learning to speak.  The learning process only begins when we start genuine, meaningful interaction.  Approach your books and tapes with this knowledge and you won't be dissapointed.	2005-07-19

The writing has an academic quality not usually found in the martial arts books and magazines, which are often aimed at the lesser lights among us.  In fact, I am too embarressed to be seen reading a copy of Black belt magazine nowadays, unless I have it hidden inside a copy of Hustler perhaps. <br /> <br />Yet the book has not held up in all aspects.  Since it was written, there have been whole worlds of knowledge opened up to martial arts practitioners.  This book was written in the dark ages, when real knowledge was kept hidden and what was taught openly was worse than garbage.  Not only have many masters brought their arts into the open, but new trends have developed, new paradigms set, myths destroyed and more.   <br /> <br />Something of this scope and quality is sorely needed today.  Draeger is dead.  Smith hasn't publshed anything recently that I am aware of.  It may be up to someone else to do an updated survey of the martial arts. <br /> <br />Still a classic and a necessary part of any MA library.	2005-07-19

Col. Tretyakov, perhaps one of the few competent Russian officers in the Russo-japanese conflict, details the day to day heroic struggles of his regiment.  The defence of 203 meter hill and Port Arthur is one of the great stories in military history.  There are nice photos of the defences and some helpful maps.  A difficlut to find book, but worth the effort.	2005-07-19

He draws on his own vast experience as well as his readings of the ancients to develop a scientific system of warfare.  Everything from how to scout the enemy, set up camp, speak to the troops, utilize the different forces at your disposal, conduct a pursuit or retreat is all covered in detail.      After reading this closely, It seems that many of the myths that have developed around the tactics of the Thirty Years War -especially the role of firepower cavalry-may have started with some misreadings of Montecuccoli.  These misreadings are not to hard to trace back to this book.    The book actually consists of three parts.  First, a well researched bio of Montecuccoli, written by Barker.  Second, a translation of Montecuccoli's Military Intellectual and Battle.  Third, descriptions of several major battles of the 30 Years war.  The descriptions rely on some old sources, especially the Breitenfeld and Lutzen battles, but are still well done overall.    Reccomended for historians, both amateur and professional, and wargamers of the period.	2005-07-19

The book moves along, yet leaves nothing out.  The descriptions of the battles are written in such a fluid, lucid style that few have achieved. If you want to know every move some particular regiment made in the battle, you won't find that here.  This is a general bio of Frederick and not concerned solely with his battles.  But Asprey does manage to convey the ebb and flow of the battles through a very direct, almost telegraphic at times, way of writing. <br /> <br />A great introduction to all aspects of Fredericks life.	2005-07-19

That is, to capture information about a subject for further reference.  Mr Rankin is an accomplished painter and uses this technique apparently as a basis for his watercolors.  His method can produce beautiful sketches at times-as he shows- but that apparently is not the main intention.   <br /> <br />Rankin's method presented here involves using a 9b pencil to do fast contours of separate shapes, blended together with a smudge technique, and heavily emphasising values.  I tend to do all my sketches in ballpoint, without regard for shading, and without consideration for future studio work, so his method doesn't quite appeal to me personally.  Still, I went through his book, practiced every exercise, and I definitely feel I learned some valuable things.   <br /> <br />Recently, I went to a local museum to sketch, where they don't allow pens into the gallery.  I brought my 9b pencils and tortillions and had a succesful trip using Mr. Rankin's techniques.  The method in Fast Sketching Techniques is easy to learn and the instruction is excellent.  If you are a total beginner, I might recommend a true beginner's book first, before this.  Ohterwise, it's a useful addition to your bookshelf.	2005-07-18

He impresses you with how much information he can convey to a layperson rather than with how dense and frustrating he can make a subject appear.  I have some backround in philosophy but almost none in music, and found this book perhaps one of the most illuminating works of intellectual history I have ever read.  Wagner is shown to be a tremndous intellect, not just an artsy music type.  Magee also reveals Wagner's early political involvement in leftist crusades, something probably well known to those with a smattering of music education, but unknown to many others.  The relationship between Wagner and Nietzsche turns out to be polar opposite of what I thought.  <br /> <br />The introduction to Schopenhauer was the most rewarding part of this book for me. After reading this book, I was amazed not only at the content of Schopenhauer's thought, but that I was able to go through several years of philosophy at the university level without studying him directly.  I had no idea how great his influence was, not just on Wagner and Nietzsche, but on other thinkers as well.	2005-07-18

In short, a must read!  Sure we are all proud Americans, but a look from the other side can be healthy now and then.  Besides, Hamsun doesn't seem to me to be hateful, just honest about, and sometimes puzzled by, what he sees.  He goes so far as to offer explanations for America's condition, recognizing the short time the country has existed as the reason for its low culture. <br /> <br />I found myself nearly on the floor from laughter every few pages as Hamsun critiques America's cultural icons, Whitman and Emerson.  Accurately, in my opinion.  His description of the behavior of the audience at the theater will stay with me forever. <br /> <br />As for the \\"...Modern...\\" part of the title, don't be fooled.  Hamsun's descriptions of life in then USA are as accurate now as they were one hundred years ago.  In fact, the most startling thing about  this book is how little has changed since Hamsun's visits.	2005-07-18

Also, as others have stated, there is no other published English language translation of the complete 50 poems, so fans of the poem will have to make do.  Besides, I am a mere diletante when it comes to poetry and don't dare come down to hard on a professional.  <br /> <br />I first came to Pierrot Lunaire through Schoenberg's work and was horrified.  It wasn't just the awful atonal music, but the imagery of a psychopathic, homicidal clown that was disturbing.  Of course, like most people, I know clowns to be the blood sucking spawns of satan that they are, and find nothing amusing about them.  After researching the Commedia a bit, I came to realize that Pierrot isn't exaclty a clown in the modern sense, but more of a comic entertainer.  I now picture him as a euro-Emo Philps type.  Much more palatable...or maybe not.  Anyway, once I overcame my initial revulsion, I began to see the beauty in this work.  The poems are exquisite, playful and heroic. Human nature is exposed from all angles.  The sequencing is different in the original than in Schoenberg's work and I haven' quite figured out what Giraud was up to with his ordering of the rondeaus, while Schoenberg's was clearer to me. <br /> <br />I would love to see more written about the poem as well as about Giraud.  he is apparently considered a minor figure in the poetry world and little is available.	2005-07-18

This is covered in other books, but not this extent.  Other methods treat this material as secondary to contour and gesture, here it is the focus of a drawing.  The book is filled with excellent ,forceful examples of using rhythm, shape, and line to bring out the life in a subject. <br /> <br />There is one weakness here.  The author does cover many things beginners need to know, but goes over them very quickly. While a beginner could learn from this book, perhaps a little experience with the basics would be helpful before coming to this book. <br /> <br />The author is an animator and besides appealing to other animators, his clean style would appeal to those interested in sketching or reportage, a subject which the author devotes a  whole chapter to.	2005-07-18

I bought it after seeing the PBS Seabiscuit documentary in which Lauren Hillenbrand appeared.  This book taught me so much about the racing business and the people who make it go.  I was also angered by the treatment the jockeys get as well as the lack of recognition they receive for their athletic skills.  I have come to love horse racing partly as a result of this book, but I would hope its popularity would spur some sort of reforms in the racing business.      Still, Seabiscuit:  An American Legend is a thoroughly researched, engaging book, detailing the life and times of a charismatic, champion athlete and his people.	2005-07-18

Arguably the greatest military memoir ever written as well as the one of the greatest adventure stories ever told.  Xenophon shows himself to be both a strong, fair leader and a humble person as he recounts the retreat from enemy territory.   I understand there was a time when this was part of a mandatory curriculum in schools. How far we have fallen.   Anabasis is a great story for all ages and would be a wise choice as a gift for young readers ( even if the younger ones need some help from their parents).	2005-07-18

Guthrie has provided us with orders of battle for major and minor acions, as well as descriptions of battles presented in a level of detail previously unheard of.<br /><br />On the other hand, it is not the scholarly presentation some might hope for.  The author makes statements, many controversial, that are not even footnoted.  In fact, the footnotes, when they are there, are explanatory, and cite no source.  This is most regretable as many of the authors, assertions, besides being most interesting, have been challenged or questioned by scholars on the subject, yet we have no way of understanding what led the author to his views.  A fairly extensive, multi-language bibliography is however, included in the back.<br /><br />I was especially disappointed with Guthrie's failure to take into account some of the latest research, especially that of Richard Brzezinski, concerning the tactics and quality of the Swedish and League cavalry.  Guthrie persists in repeating the outdated, IMO, view that the League/Imperial cavalry used the caracole as their primary method of attack, while the Swedes charged with swords drawn.<br /><br />This book has received some mixed reviews on internet discussion boards. For all its flaws it is still a must have, mainly because nothing like it exists in the English language.  Primary source material is lacking on the Thirty Years War anyway, and controversy is inevitable.  I prefer to welcome this effort by Guthrie and look foreward to his future works.	2005-07-18

It is about man and nature, blood and soil, and therefore places Hamsun on the right, opposed to liberalism and more importantly, the Marxist materialism that threatened Europe at the time.  Hamsun's war time activities are best understood through this novel. <br /> <br />I wasn't as taken with the writing and story of Growth as I was with some of Hamsun's other novels and especially with his non-fiction.  I can't say this represents Hamsun in decline, but rather it shows a different side to Hamsun.  I enjoyed Growth and recommend reading it to fully understand and appreciate the range thought and style of a literary giant.	2005-07-17

In fact, what he does doesn't even fall into the catgory of fitness.  The Egoscue method works the structural and functional systems that underlie all physical activity.  It is an efficiency-building system designed to make your body function as nature intended it to function.      The fraud of most fitness programs, be they muscle building, body sculpting, fat burning or some other trendy name, is that they actually can harm your health by destroying your natural function.  Truth is, most fitness programs are selling you aesthetics, as in a more attractive body, not health.  Since most people don't want to admit to being so narcissitic, the programs are necessarily sold with the false pretense of being at least partly health programs.      Egoscue doesn't come out against any activity, system, or aesthetic, but simply recognizes that the body has to be restored to proper functioning condition first, or physical activity will only reinforce the structural and functional weaknesses in the body, leading ultimately to physical problems. You can continue to lift weights, run, or do any activity you currently do, but adding Egoscue's routine to your workout makes your performance better and secures your health.    The idea of proper function as presented here, is rarely fully grasped by the fitness or medical community today.  Pete Egoscue is the rare individual who understands the body, how to make it more efficient and how to prepare it for a workout program.     The routines here should be the foundation of any fitness or health program.	2005-07-17

Too often, studies dealing with National Socialism and related idealogies lack objectivity, never revealing the full depth and breadth of the thinkers involved.  Not so here.  The author even points out the mistakes made by many critics in underestimating the thinkers in question. <br /> <br />The chapter on Ernst Junger is the most fascinating.  Herf makes Junger's writings clear by placing them in the cultural milieu of the time, something important for understanding most authors, but vital for Junger.  While I imagine in hindsight Junger still come off as strange to most of us, he is at least understandable now. <br /> <br />While I can't match the author's experience in research and reading, I remain somewhat skeptical of the extent to which the Nazis adopted reactionary modernism.  Was it just a means to an end, to be abandoned once the war was won, in favor of romantic pastoralism.  Why the need for lebensraum in the east if not to escape the crowded, \\"un-nordic\\" city life? <br /> <br />Also, I wonder if the author's reading of Heidegger isn't a bit off.  While Heidegger himself may have prefered the cabin in the woods to the metropolis, I always read his anti-technological views as an attack on a technological, calculating mindset, or way of viewing the world, not as being against the machine neccesarily.	2005-07-17

Nicolaides gives students a series of different drills, each designed to isolate and develop one skill.  The gesture drawings shown in the book are not intended to pass for finished drawings.  Rather they are one dimension of a finished work.  Same for blind contours.  Nicolaides explicitly states this in his introduction for everyone to read.  There should be no confusion on this issue and no need to criticise the drawings in the book.  Nicolaides compares this to a singing instructor who first gives his student breathing exercises. The student doing the breathing isn't trying to breathe for a crowd at Carnegie hall, he is just building a foundation for further practice.<br /><br />Take a good look at the cover of this book.  You will see three figures.  At the top, a getsure.  To the left a contour.  Between them is the finished drawing, combining the feeling of the gesture with the form of the contour drawing.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I would buy it for nothing else than the descriptions of how to do gesture and contour.  It seems many imitators have come along since K.N. wrote this book.  Nothing I have seen has matched the explainations in this book.  I refer to it often.<br /><br />The schedules are tough to follow, but nobody is standing next to you with a gun to make sure you folow them to the letter.  Do them as you see fit, but try not to jump ahead until you can perform each exercise to your satisfaction.<br /><br />A must have in my opinion.	2005-07-17

In Who Are We, Huntington makes a clear case for ending our insane immigration policies.  Huntington's case is so well made that the opponents of America and  American values have turned their hysterical attacks on the book and Huntington himself into high gear.<br />Having grown up on the east coast, I was unprepared for what I encountered when I packed up and headed to the western states.  Besides the hordes of illegal and legal immigrants and the crime that goes with them, I was also shocked to hear our &quot;guests&quot; from south of the border casually state that this land was part of Mexico.
