And it comprises such an incredibly vast body of knowledge that one or two fat books will not make anyone well versed.  Ultimately, mastering this subject will require nothing less than a small library.  David Chappell's Understanding .NET is an excellent choice as a master volume and foundation for this library--as a sort of glue that will hold it all together.  In this book every major area of .NET is probed and placed in context, and Chappell's writing style is extremely succinct and focused.  I highly recommend this book to every software developer and manager.<br />Understanding .NET provides an objective and comprehensive overview of .NET, including chapters on how Web Services work, functionality of the Common Runtime Language, comparisons between .NET programming languages, how to work with the Class Library, new features of ADO.NET and ASP.NET, a description of .NET My Services, and how all of these parts fit together.<br /> <br />Most obviously, this book is a perfect starting point for developers who may be skilled in DNA or some other architecture but new to .NET.  The familiar terminology and intelligent references provide engaging, informative reading, and there is enough density and new information to make every paragraph worth reading.  This is not one of those easy-listening books where the reader is advised in the preface to skip the first three chapters.<br /> <br />This book also has much to offer developers who may have been working with .NET for some time but somehow missed the beginning of the movie.  When plunging into a particular area of a new technology, especially one as vast as .NET, it is quite easy to never be completely clear about the main plot.  By placing each major aspect of .NET clearly in context Chappell enables developers to back off for a moment to see the big picture, quite likely leading to exploration of new areas and a more comprehensive \\"understanding\\" of the environment.<br /> <br />For technical managers who want a clear understanding of the workings of the .NET Framework but naturally can't afford to make a career out of the details, Understanding .NET is a must read.  This is perhaps as far into the details as a manager needs to go, but it should be mandatory material for any technical manager worth his or her salt.  Because of Chappell's focused writing style, this book is even suitable for a layperson who needs to be a step ahead.<br /> <br />Understanding .NET is no sissy book, and at the same time it's not rocket science.  It is an aptly titled volume with a wealth of information that everyone involved with .NET needs to know.  --Review by David A.	2003-02-08

This book has brought me the overall picture of the .NET security system: How does the system work and interact with the existing security system on Win NT platform? In addition, the book is clearly written, well- organized, and full of in-depth information.   <br />Overall, I consider this is an excellent book which could satisfy the security needs for all .NET developers and administrators. <br />This book is divided into five sections:<br />1. Introduction to the .NET Developer Platform Security:<br /> This section provides an introduction to the .NET Framework platform and all of the new security features available. Although this section describes only brief information, I still recommend that every one should read it first before jumping to the others. The first section &quot;provides common background material for the topic-specific discussions in the remainder of the book.&quot;<br />2. Code Access Security Fundamentals:<br /> <BR>This section provides an extensive introduction to Code Access Security, a powerful and surprising code-based security feature shipping in .NET Framework. Many new terminologies are explained: Evidence, Permissions, Stack Walk, Code Groups, Policy Levels, etc. <br />This section is really difficult. I felt overwhelmed with too many new concepts and skipped it. However, after reading some chapters of the next section, I realized that the code-based security concept is the keystone for the entire security system. I had to come back to section two and read it carefully. Learn from my lesson, you should try to understand it at the first time you read it.<br />3. ASP.NET and Web Services Security Fundamentals:<br />This section provides brief information about server-side security features of ASP.NET and Web Services. <br />4. .NET Framework Security Administration:<br />This section provides a comprehensive guide to administer .NETFramework security. It shows you when and how to make modifications. Some topics are presented as tutorials. It is very to easy to capture and follow the steps. <br />5. .NET Framework Security for Developers<br />The final section is devoted to developers. It provides all needed information to build secure assemblies, web sites, applications, and web services. It also provides an in-depth introduction to the cryptography library shipping in the .NET Framework and to XML digital signatures. For developers who don't have enough time to read the whole book, this is the section that you should spend your time on. -- Review by Trung N.	2003-02-08

The examples in the book are very easy to understand and use as a reference.  The book explained very good information about ADO.NET concept and all the aspects of it.  I have already started to use this book at work for a quick reference. I liked the chapter 9 \\"ADO.NET and XML\\" the most.<br />From the beginning of the book in chapter 1 it was easy to understand the ADO.NET concept.  This chapter provided a very good understanding of how ADO.NET works and how technology of data access evolved into ADO.NET.  Chapters 2 and 3 provided good explanations and examples of getting connected to the database and issuing SQL commands. Chapter 3 also provided good information and examples on how the result of the SQL commands.  Chapter 4 gave very good insight on the DataReader and how to use most of its functionality.<br />Chapters 5, 6, and 7 were all about the Datasets, how to construct datasets, worth with datasets, and a new programming model the Typed Datasets.  Chapter 8 provided a good explanation with excellent examples on how to update the Database and how to manage concurrency whether the Dataset is connected or disconnected.  Chapter 9 explained the relationship between ADO.NET and XML.  It described how well XML and ADO.NET are integrated.  Chapter 10 discusses DataBinding, something I don't normally do. However, the examples were very good.  Lastly chapter 11 gave some very well thought out design suggestions. --Review by Annie W.	2003-02-07

Ever since the time of &quot;Essential COM&quot;, I know Don will teach me .NET in great depth. I was not disappointed with the book. I was also surprised to find out that Don has made very effort to make the book readable.<br />I already owned &quot;Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming&quot; by Jeffrey Richter, I was eager to put both books under comparison since both books cover similar subjects. Both books offer a lot of detail and both books are easy to read. However, the coverage in Jeffrey Richter's book benefits a wider audience and the availability of source code from Wintellect web site is a plus. You need to step through the code to get a good understanding of what is &quot;app domain&quot;.<br />If your goal is to get the deepest understanding of CLR, then Don's book is a good read after reading Jeffrey's book.

As the author states, it isn't intended to be a tutorial and shouldn't be your first choice if you are new to .NET programming (I'd recommend the excellent Applied .NET Framework Programming by Jeffrey Richter as a good starter book). However, reading Essential .NET could potentially save you lots of time sifting through the MSDN documentation to find out why your program is not behaving exactly the way you think it should (you know, those little, tiny, nasty bugs that prove to be the hardest to find).<br /> As with any book that tries to cover such an extensive ground as the .NET CLR is, there are tradeoffs in the depth and extent with which the author describes each subject. In this case, Box chose to highlight the details of the inner workings of the CLR that we, as programmers, must have present to make efficient and appropriate use of the runtime facilities. Chapters one through five deal with basic concepts that, in my opinion, are best left to an introductory book and are not worth more than skimming through them, although you could always find a golden needle hidden in the haystack. However, on chapters six and after, the book really takes off and you'll probably find new things to learn page after page. <br />Although the crucial details are clearly exposed, this book is by no means exhaustive, I believe it can be considered more as a base from where you can start researching further about the subject of your interest. For example chapter seven, &quot;Advanced Methods&quot;, deals with stack/message transitions, proxies, sinks and contexts. All these concepts are very well covered but I didn't get the eureka! feeling until I read Ingo Rammer's Advanced .NET Remoting and could see those concepts in action and realize their importance.<br />All in all, a book that deserves a slot in your .NET library (a slot somewhere in between a pairof good tutorials and the in-detail books about the areas of the framework that draw your interest). I would consider it a good investment of your time and money and I also see myself coming back to it (specially back to chapter 6-10) as a refresher.  -- Review by Julio G.	2003-01-09

It allows such programmers a way to explore most of the .NET platform apart from the Visual Studio IDE. Programmers primarily familiar with VB or Visual Studio would probably be better served by another book. Programmers more familiar with Java, Delphi, Perl, etc. will find this book a very good introduction to .NET.<br />The book covers all major areas from the core workings of the Common Language Runtime to web services. The general pace of the book is quick and broad. It assumes you already know the general topic and just want to know what classes, methods, etc. the .NET framework has to address the issue.

No single volume could begin to be a comprehensive reference on .NET due to the shear number of classes that make up its framework.  Jeff does deliver on his promise of teaching us how the pieces work together to allow us to write powerful, sophisticated applications.  Overall, I consider this book to be a valuable reference, one that is worthy of the designation of, \\"Core Reference\\", by Microsoft Press.<br />This book is not a tutorial; it is part of the Microsoft Core Reference series and goes into too much detail for the beginner.  It is however, an excellent reference book for serious programmers, and provides a look at the breadth and depth of the .NET Framework.  Author Jeff Prosise divided the book into three parts, Part 1 covers the Essential Concepts, Part 2 covers ASP.NET, and Part 3 covers what he calls \\"The Cutting Edge\\".<br />The Essential Concepts span the first four chapters.  In the first chapter he introduces the reader to .NET and covers such topics as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), the Framework Class Library (FCL), the Common Intermediate Language (CIL), and the Managed Code languages with special attention given to C#.  Jeff also talks about the ILDASM utility tool that permits us to examine the manifest of an Assembly, as well as to disassemble the CIL into assembly language instructions.<br />In the second chapter he discusses classes, structs, interfaces, enumerations, and delegates.  He introduces the concept of value types and reference types, and the use of boxing and unboxing to convert between them.  He covers fundamental .NET software development concepts such as multi-file assemblies, garbage collection, the global assembly cache and exception handling.  <br />In chapter 3 Prosise provides an overview of the Framework Class Library with emphasis on the organization of the members in the library.  He examines a selected few of the objects therein to give the reader a flavor for the FCL.  In chapter 4 he gets into the rich support provided by the FCL for developing Windows applications.  He also introduces Visual Studio.NET.  <br />Part 2 focuses on ASP.NET, and spans seven chapters.  The emphasis on ASP.NET is indicative of the purpose of the whole .NET environment.  Jeff introduces Web Forms in chapter 5, and he explores Web Form Controls in chapter 6.  He explains many of these controls in depth, and uses examples to illustrate their operation.  In the next two chapters he reveals the intricacies of User Controls and Custom Controls.  In chapter 9 he goes into detail about the structure of  ASP.NET applications and in chapter 10 he discusses ASP.NET security.  Jeff completes this section with an introduction to Web Services.  He stresses the importance of Web Services in the future of Information Technology and provides examples of Web Services.  Jeff supports the concepts introduced in this section with both code snippets and working examples written in C#.<br />Part 3 completes the book with four chapters on ADO.NET, XML, Multithreading, and Remoting.  I am not sure why Prosise chose to name this section, \\"The Cutting Edge\\".  It seems to me that all of .NET is the cutting edge, but I suppose \\"Miscellaneous\\" is not a very good name either.  ADO.NET was introduced in the examples in the previous section, but in chapter 12 Jeff goes into detail about the classes provided in the FCL to facilitate working with databases.  He leads into the next chapter by mentioning that one of ADO.NET's most touted features is its seamless support for XML.  In chapter 13, Jeff provides an overview of XML, its importance in the conduct of Web commerce, and the powerful support for XML provided by the Framework Class Library.  Chapter 14 changes the subject to Multithreading by discussing the advantages as well as the pitfalls.  Once again he describes how the FCL comes to the rescue with classes that shield the programmer from those pitfalls.  Jeff completes the book by changing the subject once again, this time to Remoting.  Here he provides an example, the NetDraw application to illustrate the power of Remoting.  He predicts the use of Remoting along with Windows Forms will return to the rich client interface we enjoyed before so many user interfaces became browser based.  Jeff concludes by warning us that Microsoft .NET is a whole new ball game.  He also points out that although it is revolutionary and provides powerful tools today, .NET is not standing still and we can expect more features to be added to it in the future.  --Reviewed by Jack D.	2002-10-16

It covers the most cutting-edge topics in .NET technology, in particular Web Services and Security. As it is mentioned in the title, this book is not C# tutorial from scratch, but to use C# programming language for web applications.<br />It is clear that this book is for the C# audience to use ASP.NET, XML and ADO.NET. It covers enough topics with excellent examples. Although, it is a good reference for C# developers with hands on .NET framework and not a C# programming language tutorial.<br />The book includes 11 chapters covered in 590 pages. The introduction chapter describes ASP from the scripting languages to ASP.NET.  Chapter 2 is devoted to page framework. Chapter 3, 4, and 5 focus more deeper on ASP and configuration. Chapter 6 is devoted to Web Services. Chapter 7 point out the Security topic. HTTP containers are reported in chapter 8. Chapter 9 covers user controls and server controls. Chapter 10 is devoted to XML, and the last chapter is devoted to ADO.NET. An outstanding index section covered in 60 pages that include the most searched keywords and subtitles. <br />The authors share in this book their strong knowledge of .NET framework, with very interesting comments and examples. I recommend strongly this book for C# community to use it as a reference for .NET platform. ---Reviewed by Abder B.	2002-10-10

It provides enough information for people who are new to .NET and those who need a reference tool. The book has a good background on Visual Basic .NET, ASP.NET, XML, and ADO.NET.  Very easy to understand.<br />Chapter 2 provides good information for migrating from ASP to ASP.NET.  It helps ASP 3.0 developers understand the differences between ASP 3.0 and ASP.NET and what needs to be changed.  This book also discusses the general idea of Web Services, XML and ADO.NET with very simple examples.  Having this makes it very helpful in understanding the corrolation of all the .NET features.  You may want to pick up other books if you want to know more about these topics.  I was able to use some of the examples in my development work, the examples are very nicely written and very well explained.  This book, as is, can be a good tool for both learning .NET and used as a reference in future development work.  I  recommend the book. ---Reviewed by Annie W.	2002-10-07
US	34256797	R3N5ZECCBLAOKD	1861005318	750544794	Professional XML for .NET Developers	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Solid introduction to XML in .NET	The text covers a lot of ground in 700+ pages.  Starting with an introduction to the .NET Framework, it moves through the requisite areas of reading & writing XML, navigating the DOM, transforming, validating and serializing XML, and then on to XML-centric introductions to ADO.NET, ASP.NET, SOAP and Web Services.  Two case studies are thrown in as well.<br />Instead of just listing features, it goes the extra, more important step of actually explaining why features are important or useful and how they can be of practical benefit.  For example, in Chapter 3: <br />\\"The main difference between the XmlNodeReader and XmlTextReader is in the constructor - XmlNodeReader allows access to the contents of XML nodes obtained in some other way, such as part of an XPath resolution or an XmlDocument parse.  For example, we can select XML document fragments using XPath document manipulation methods, then iterate through the fragments to extract their content using XmlNodeReader objects.  By using a combination of these technologies, we can simplify our code while keeping memory consumption to a minimum.\\"<br />On the down side, the quality varies from chapter to chapter, as can be expected from a book with multiple authors.  For the most part, both VB.NET and C# examples are included, though occasionally, and for no apparent reason, only one or the other is shown (examples of both are included in the downloads available on the Wrox site).<br />Like many of the Wrox Professional books, it tells you more than you might need or care to know at the given moment, but because of that breadth and depth of content, it serves as an excellent reference.<br /> \\"Professional XML for .NET Developers\\" was published while the .NET Framework was still in Beta 2, so there are some anomalies that show up.  Wrox has updated code samples and errata available for download on their site.<br />Chapter 1 has the requisite, though satisfying, introduction to the .NET Framework.  There's an enlightening discussion of the Common Language Specification (CLS) and the Common Type System and how, in practical terms, they contribute to cross language interoperability.<br />Chapter 2, among other things, has a lucid and very helpful explanation of the various config files and their relationship to each other.<br />Chapter 3 contains a thorough explanation of the objects that allow forward-only reading and writing of XML, a discussion of lesser known objects such as the Stack and NameTable objects, as well as a more complicated example at the end of the chapter that brings it all together.<br />Chapter 7 gives a quick intro to serialization, how to do it and why it's useful, then covers dealing with unexpected XML content via three of the Serializer object's specific events.  Also goes into serializing complex objects, composite objects as well as fine-tuning serialization using .NET Framework attributes.  There was an enlightening and useful explanation of the XSD Generator Tool which allows you to generate an XSD schema from a class and vice versa.<br />Chapter 9 contains a curious departure/case study extending the XmlReader and XmlWriter to communicate with Word and Visio as target applications.<br />Chapter 10 packs a respectable, XML-centric introduction to ADO.NET into 50 pages, focusing largely on datasets and how they interact with schemas. <br />Chapter 11 gives a quick intro to ASP.NET, some of the basic Web Controls, and a discussion of the web.config file's most important sections.<br />Chapter 13 has a brief, very basic description of Web Services, SOAP and UDDI.  I'd highly recommend \\"Professional ASP.NET Web Services\\" for a thorough, in-depth treatment on the subject.	2002-10-04

It has many so-called &quot;real world&quot; code samples to help you practice as you read. I don't know if I would call them &quot;real world&quot; but they are good enough to help you learn. The book is very well organized and covers many topics from reading and writing XML files to showing you some ADO.NET and ASP.NET. It also has a small portion on web services and SOAP.<br />The only problem I had with the book was that the code samples were not consistent. There are many samples that have both a C# and VB version but some have only one. For example, a Case Study they have which is a DVD Rental System is written only in VB.NET. For a C# programmer, that means you have to re-write the code for C# yourself just to run the sample. This does not take so long but you should not have to do all that.<br />Personally, I think they should have made the book shorter by only using one language, C# of course as this is the language of choice for the .NET framework. But I guess they had to make the book for everyone.<br />I strongly recommend that you know XML and a .NET programming language before picking up this book, otherwise, you will be completely lost. ---Reviewed by Elmer Morales	2002-10-04

It is not meant as a C# tutorial, which is made clear on the cover and back of the book, as well as in the &quot;Who is this book for?&quot; section of the introduction.  My review included a cover to cover read through of the book, although this is not the recommended use of this book.  It should be used as it's title indicates &quot;Programmer's Reference.&quot;  That is, it should be sitting in arms reach of your workstation whilst you are coding and I think you'd get  the best day to day use of it that way.  <br />The book is 28 chapters, and the first 20 are short and cover the C# language itself.  The  last 8 cover: .NET class roadmap; System classes, Collections, I/O, Reflection, Text manipulation, Regular expressions, and Threading.  There is one appendix on keywords, and one on Naming Conventions. The book is 555 pages and includes a very  complete 30 page index which I referred to frequently to look up concepts covered previously in the text.<br />What I like about the book: 1. it is that is extremely concise.  2. There are many fully functional short programs  that demonstrate one or two objects, and the syntax to use them.  These can be used as examples in larger applications that developers can use 3. It is very well organized with a condensed quick ref. table of contents on the inside cover, and more detailed contents a few pages in.  What I didn't like was that it skipped large sections of the Framework class library.  This is not necessarily bad, however, since it's aim is to cover frequently used, not all, classes, and it did give references to other books (published by Wrox of course) that contain the lacking information. <br />I downloaded the code examples from the Wrox website and the handful that I compiled and executed ran without a hitch. ---Reviewed by Bill Morgan	2002-10-04

Introduction chapters were very helpful to get me started and the details came in later chapters. I had no issues with C# code examples.<BR> <BR>This book is well organized, I liked the introduction chapters that start you at the 10,000 foot level and then the later chapters dug deep down into details.  This Top-Down approach was very useful to me to understand the material.<br />The first few chapters discuss the major components of Web Services to give the reader a good understanding of the architecture involved.  The major components discussed were organized in conceptual layers such as the Transport, the Data encoding (XML and XML Schema), SOAP, WSDL and UDDI.  Also some history and other technologies were compared.  Examples of Web Services were given immediately to show how easy it is to write Web Services in Note Pad and better yet in Visual Studio .NET.<br />Chapter 3 explained how to consume a Web Service once it is built.<br />Starting with chapter 4 the conceptual layers were explained in greater details<br />WSDL and all the sections involved, Wire Formats like SOAP and Custom Techniques.<br />Finally Web Services Discovery (UDDI) was discussed in chapter 7.  All well done.<br />More advanced subjects were discussed starting with chapter 8 like Design techniques, Asynchronous programming, State management, Transactions, Data Caching, Authentication and SOAP Security.   Exposing Data and Serialization etc.  Well done also.<br />I liked reading the case studies using BizTalk Server, Passport-Style Authentication Services, and Distributed Processing, you can find them at the end of the book.  I was more interested in the Passport-Style Authentication and Distributed Processing.  I did not have time for any examples on the case studies.<br />Over all this book is very good, and I strongly recommend it.  This book explained the material well using the right approach.  I found few errors here and there but I have not found a book that is perfect.  Most of the examples that I had time to try worked well.  This book is NOT only for intermediate and advanced users because if you are a beginner to Web Services and like to be challenged then this book is also for you. ---Reviewed by Gus Aawar	2002-10-04

It's very easy to read and understand and find what you need.  With little background of VB.NET and ASP.NET, you will be able to write your first database driven web applications.  This book is good as a starting point on the subject matter.  The book goes through the items in short simple to understand paragraphs.<br />For experienced developers, you may want to skip the first two chapters.   Chapter 2 gives an overview of realational database, how to use  the database to retrieve and store the data.  Chapter 3 covers methods for connecting to several different data source such as SQL Server, Excel, and XML.  Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 have lots of examples in reading and displaying the data using Data Reader and Data Set objects.  All the examples in the book use Data Grid control for displaying the data.  Later in the book, it discusses ways of using the data grid control for creating,inserting, editing, and  deleting records.  I tried several of the examples in the book and they worked fine.  That is one thing I have come to like about the WROX press books is their examples are very understandable and easy to learn from.<br />Also, the experienced developer who is interested in learning the subject matter may find many other sections in the book boring because they will go through material they already know.   It would be very nice to see a book such as this that can cover the subject for people who are already experienced as developers.<br />This book is well written and has the information that a junior programmer can use on his/her first programming language and the VB.NET/ASP.NET fundamentals for the experienced programmer to get a first look. ---Reviewed by Michael S.	2002-10-04

It distinguishes nicely between connected and disconnected access.  Later chapters provide specialized material for users of other database libraries who are converting to ADO.NET.   Most code is fragmentary but some complete programs are available online.  The code could be more clearly identified with the corresponding text sections. <br />Although this book starts with an introductory chapter with a brief introduction to SQL and the relational model, most chapters dive into discussions that might drown novices unless more tutorial background was included.   However those with some database experience would find a useful detailed introduction to ADO.NET.<br />The book is easy to read.  Each chapter has many code fragments, and perhaps a few complete programs.  All those I tried compiled without error.  The examples in Chapter 2, ADO.NET Basics, assume SQL Server is the database.  While it would be easy to convert the examples to another provider, the data would not be available and users of other databases cannot execute these examples.    The downloaded code contains some Palm database files, but without any explanation of what to do with them.<br />Chapter 4 has only two complete program available for download.  The first is included in the book on p. 165, but Chapter 4 starts on p. 127.  The second refers to a brief section at the end of the chapter which has no code.  It would be much more helpful to have complete examples from earlier in the chapter.<br />The code fragments from Chapter 4 are available for download.  It takes a while to correspond the code to the text.  My sleuthing found that Figure 4.3 in the code is Listing 4.1 in the text, Figure 4.4 is Listing 4.2 and so on.  The fragments compile and execute, but are not as helpful as complete programs.<br />The book is nicely written and has lots of information.  The author is clearly experienced and knowledgable.   It would be a lot easier to learn from if more complete examples were provided and clearly identified with specific sections in the text. ---Reviewed by Art G.	2002-10-04

Net Programmers Reference	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Great dog-eared, coffee-stained reference	This book is ideal for intermediate programmers developing web applications with Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET. It works best as a reference for those simply looking for ways to &quot;make stuff work&quot; who don't need the hand-holding of step-by-step instructions, but aren't ready for simple, austere object definitions. Using an appropriate number of examples in both C# and VB.NET, the authors have successfully put together a book that has helped my shop overcome several hurdles in the month we've been using it. <BR> In the new .NET paradigm, ASP exists only as a descriptive name applied to collections of objects that &quot;make stuff work&quot; on the web. Powered by C#, VB.NET, or almost any language you chose,  the .NET framework Intermediate Language and Just-In-Time compilation has made an understanding of how &quot;classic&quot; Active Server Pages work obsolete.<br />  However, the name ASP seems to be maintained to provide familiarity to those of us making the transition from ASP 3.0 to &quot;any-web-application-built-with-.NET.&quot; This book fulfils that calling by giving the right mix of definitions, examples, and background information without  using excess space or time.<br />  The majority of the chapters cover most of the collections of objects (namespaces) that give an application functionality on the web. Without question, we used these sections the most. For those of us making the transition to C# at the same time we're getting used to .NET web development, these chapters were a life-saver. They gave all the answers we couldn't find in any C# reference manual tailored specifically for the types of web applications we were creating. Since we adopted .NET a few months ago, for the first time we were able to concetrate on functionality instead of C# as a frustrating language. I'm not sure how VB 6.0 programmers will look at it, but they seem to be getting the better reference books in the marketplace so far, so it was a relief to find every example done in both C# and VB.NET. <br />  While this book would be key for beginning .NET developers ready  for more robust applications or intermediate programmers moving from another language, I suspect that advanced programmers will be disappointed. For example, XML and Mobile Devices get chapters, but they don't conatain enough information for real development. You would need to have a much better background in either subject to actually develop. However, if you had that background, these sections wouldn't tell you anything you didn't already know.<br />  The strength of this book is not as a &quot;front-to-back&quot; read, but as the dog-eared, coffee-stained reference that allows an intermediate level programmer to produce web applications that work--and work well. While not an expert, I've used ASP.NET Programmer's Reference to give myself a solid base of knowledge. By the time I master the material, I'll be well-prepared to tackle some of the more obscure .NET namespaces and cutting edge web technologies. ---Reviewed By Jay L.	2002-10-04

The book frequently comparies features between VB6 and C# which make the transition easier. <br />Started with a brief introduction of the .NET framework, C# language features and Visual Studio NET common tools, the book leads you directly into building a Windows applications - the SuperMind and the SweepCSharp games.  It's fun to be able to code  functional games early on.<br />Through the BookReview Manager project, the book effectively introduces the use of some common Windows Forms controls (such as TreeView control, ComboBox , Context Menu, DateTimePicker), existing ActiveX controls (e.g. Web Browser, MAPI controls), the creation of custom controls and data-binding at design time.<br />For VB programmers who write mainly 2-tier Client-Server applications which consist of forms that collect user data and also connect to SQL Server databases, the book will guide them into designing 3-tier applications through the KnnwledgeBase project, in which database access via ADO.NET is well covered.<br />The book sticks to its hands-on approach to the end  by creating a setup program for the SweepCSharp game.<br />The book does not cover debugging tools and debugging related windows which I think are very important in .NET development.      <br />Due to it's introductory nature, the book leaves out some advanced topics such graphics, multi-threading, object serialization, reflection. ---Reviewed by Timothy D.	2002-10-04

I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to grow beyond static-content web pages and begin development of data-driven web applications.<br /> Written by a team of 10 professionals with different areas of expertise, this book provides a solid foundation for creating web applications that rely on creating, modifying, and displaying information accessed from an SQL database, although the source can be any data repository that has an OLEDB or ODBC driver written for it.  Filled with many rich examples, both in the text and in the hands-on exercises, the authors go beyond the &quot;this is the code you need to insert&quot; paradigm and explain what each section of code is doing, reinforcing lessons learned from earlier examples as necessary.  The exercises can either be typed in or run from source downloaded from the WROX Press website, both are error-free.  The book is full of tips and best-practice methodologies, with an entire chapter devoted to performance considerations.  The exercises were tested on students in a school lab and common mistakes are presented in a section of each chapter.   WROX Press also has multiple levels of support available to those who need it.
