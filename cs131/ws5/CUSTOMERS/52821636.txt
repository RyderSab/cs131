Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam is an intensely humble, spiritual and brilliantly insightful man.  Through sheer grit, determination, hardwork, and a brilliant mind, he transformed the Indian defense research establishment, and went to hold some of the most sensitive jobs in government.  In the process he made his mark as a visionary and project manager par excellence, while leading the development of the Integrated Guided Missile Program that resulted in the development of all modern Indian missiles.  Developing and mastering indigenous technologies that were denied from the West, Dr. Kalam showed that even in the depth of despair, there is hope, and tremendous technological achievements are indeed possible with the right mix of talent, hard work, fair play, and motivation.  Dr. Kalam is a genuine Indian hero -- and his election as the President of India rightfully deserved.	2003-11-27

I was disappointed.  The author makes numerous judgments (often negative) about the Frontier Gandhi, but does not give the Frontier Gandhi's perspective nor look at the world through the Frontier Gandhi's eyes.  Instead, the book is divided into chapters, with each chapter dealing with controversial issues on the Frontier Gandhi's life (e.g. Partition, Pakhtoonistan, Referendum, etc.), and in each case the author castigates the Frontier Gandhi.  Thus, I would say that this book is severely biased.  Any historical figure can be criticized and castigated through a selective analysis of historical events, and this book does not move beyond that.  It fails to analyze the Frontier Gandhi's motivations for his positions and stands, and fails to give a richer perspective on the Frontier Gandhi's life. I am surprised that Oxford University Press would allow such weak scholarship to be published under their label.	2001-06-27

Yet, the book faults Prime Minister Nehru of India primarily for provoking and then mis-managing the war.  The book is a damning account of the ineptitude of top Indian political leadership in strategic matters.  India, facing all the disadvantages of terrain, chose to pursue a 'Forward Policy' of establishing indefensible flag posts that could only be supplied by air, against a world-class PLA land army that held the advantage of a well-connected road network throughout some of the most inhospitable terrain in the world.  After refusing to enter into meaningful negotiations on defining the border, Nehru pursued this myopic policy because he foolishly deluded himself into believing that the Chinese would be unwilling to enforce their territorial claims by force of arms.  In the end, the war broke out at in a narrow Himalayan valley that could not possibly have been any more disadvantageous for Indians -- the Chinese positions overlooked a denuded, unready Indian infantry brigade which lacked ANY ARTILLERY SUPPORT WHATSOEVER, that was THREE WEEKS away from the nearest Indian roadhead by foot across high mountain passes and thick tropical forests, and supplied exclusively by erratic air drops.  The Chinese, by contrast, had a 7-ton roadhead barely a few hours walk away. The book also severely castigates the Indian political leadership for interfering with the functioning of the military in matters of promotions of senior officers.  The end result was that by 1962 the Indian General Staff had become mere supplicants of their political masters, and unable to counter impossible strategic/tactical demands with an objective, professional military analysis.  Thus, senior military officers at the general staff level (who had never held major combat commands before) were often making decisions for individual battalions or companies -- all the while not protesting against the impossible demands being made of them. Another excellent account of the military aspect of the battle at Thag La is 'Himalayan Blunder' by Brigadier JP Dalvi -- the beleagured brigade commander who was given impossible orders to assault well-defended Chinese positions at an altitde ranging from 14,000 feet to 18,000 feet with no air/artillery support, roughly 3 battalions spread over 12 miles, and only 50 rounds of pouch ammunition per man!

Even so, one cannot but empathize with the author for having been made a scapegoat for the follies  of his superiors and West Pakistani politicians - most notably Yahya Khan  and Z. A. Bhutto.  Gen. Niazi is a beleaguered man today who has been  shunned by the Pakistani establishment for his role in the loss of East  Pakistan, and unfairly stripped of all pension benefits.<br />Niazi had had  an unblemished military record up until 1971, including action in several  theaters in WWII, 1948, and 1965.  Until 1971, he had been decorated with  medals no less than 23 times, including winning the Military Cross in Burma  during WWII.  He earned the nickname 'Tiger' after spearing a Japanese  officer to death in hand-to-hand combat in the jungles of Burma.<br />In the  larger drama of the events leading up to the 1971 war, he was only a minor  actor, and subservient to President Yahya Khan and scheming politicians.  He was responsible for carrying out impossible orders which were issued in  the face of overwhelming odds, by the same individuals who had allowed and  even actively promoted the events to come to such a sorry pass.  Indeed  East Pakistan was lost on the day Yahya Khan decided, at the behest of Z.  A. Bhutto, to cancel the convening of the National Assembly - the first  nationwide, democratically elected assembly in united Pakistan's  history.<br />The subsequent events - civil unrest, military crackdown in East  Pakistan, pouring of millions of refugees into India, partisan resistance,  war with India and defeat, followed an almost predictable pattern.  Niazi  cannot be blamed for those (with the exception of the slaughter of innocent  civilians by troops under his command) - only the leaders and politicians  in West Pakistan can accept that blame.<br />The most poignant part of the  book is a gut-wrenching letter written in 1995 to then President Leghari of  Pakistan requesting the reinstatement of his military pension benefits for  a career spanning over 40 years.  In that letter Niazi explains how he was  made a scapegoat by the establishment which chose to single him out, but  refused to accept its own culpability in the secession of East Pakistan.  Other individuals, especially Bhutto, who were far more culpable went to  attain even higher positions in Pakistan.  Perhaps, in time, Pakistan will  eventually reinstate Niazi in the pantheon of its military leaders.dent Leghari of  Pakistan requesting the reinstatement of his military pension benefits for  a career spanning over 40 years.

The book is very well researched with numerous notes on various sources of information.<br />The book describes the  genesis of the problems in East Pakistan, beginning with the partition of  India and the formation of Pakistan's two wings.  Carefully collected  economic data demonstrates the lop-sided distribution of wealth in Pakistan  with more government spending and foreign aid going to the West than to the  East, despite the latter having a greater population and suffering from  severe natural disasters.  Also cited are the differences between East and  West Pakistan over confronting India over Kashmir.  The East did not share  a penchant for confronting India over Kashmir - a territory that lay over a  1000 miles away.  There were more pressing problems at home then  (circumstances that are eerily similar to those today in  Pakistan!).<br />These differences came to a height in a war fought over  Kashmir in 1965 (instigated upon Bhutto's advice to Ayub Khan) when East  Pakistan was left virtually undefended against any potential Indian  military advances.  This further contributed to its sense of  insecurity.<br />The politicians of West Pakistan, most notably Z. A. Bhutto  and Yahya Khan, are blamed unambiguously for their role in canceling a  session of the first democratically elected national assembly in Pakistan  that precipitated in a crisis in March 1971.  India's role in contributing  to the crisis until March 1971 was minimal, if any, but was to assume  greater importance in the months to follow.  The failure of all political  processes to placate the demands of Z. A. Bhutto led to the suspension of  the National Assembly, and subsequent events.<br />However, once the crisis  resulted in millions of refugees flowing into India that threatened to  upset the delicate demographic balance in the affected states, the problem  also became one of India's.  The authors fault Indira Gandhi for not trying  harder to achieve a political settlement of the problem.  It is highly  unlikely that India could have mediated a problem between West and East  Pakistan.  After Indira Gandhi concluded that the problem could not be  resolved politically by Pakistan's leaders, India began to play an  increasingly larger political-military role, beginning in the summer of  1971 and concluding with a lightning military campaign in December, 1971.dia's.

He analyzes the political, economic, security issues that have contributed to India's decision-making regarding the bomb.  George has  correctly identified India as being caught in a dilemma for a long time  over nuclear weapons testing.  India also provides the only example of a  nuclear weapons program that was openly debated in a democratic society.   This debate (which ranked often very low on the priorities of successive  prime ministers who correctly placed socio-economic development as a higher  priority) has led to India shifting its position over time -- one from  being the first proponent of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to opposing  it due to is discriminatory nature today.  It describes how India's  opposition to nuclear weapons in the '50s which was perceived as being  moralizing in the West, has now changed to embrace weapons since the  nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty permanently endorsed the nuclear weapons  status of the five declared nuclear powers without any comprehensive,  binding time-table for destroying all nuclear weapons -- a position that  India objects to as being discriminatory.<br />A must-read for anyone  interested in nuclear weapons proliferation and arms control negotiations  today.	2000-04-10

Ms. Newberg has taken the safe, well-trodden path of fixing the blame  principally, and wrongly, on the Indian government for the strife in  Kashmir, but offers few suggestions.<br />The world should rightly be  concerned about the violence in Kashmir, but its judgment on who is to  blame should be based upon facts and not emotions, however raw they may be.   The Kashmir conflict has deep historical roots that Ms. Newburg completely  glosses over in her book.<br />Although, there are several shortcomings in the  book the principal one is a complete absence of a description of the  current political environment in the areas surrounding Kashmir.  Kashmir is  bordered by Pakistan, Tibet, Afghanistan and India.  The first three states  are hardly exemplary models for secular democracy.  The last mentioned,  India, has so far borne the burden of introducing representative democracy  (however flawed it may seem to outsiders) in a region that has slowly come  grudgingly under the authority of religious fundamentalism and the gun.   For doing a difficult job made impossible under current circumstances,  India should be applauded, not criticized.  Holding elections in an area  where Islamic fundamentalists, with considerable support from those other  model pillars of liberal democracies - Pakistan (which has just had its  fourth military coup in its history) and the Afghan Taleban threaten to  shoot voters, is not an easy task for any government.  This makes the task  of correcting previous wrongs by any civilian government very difficult,  since democratic expression is not allowed through the ballot.  Ms. Newburg  completely ignores this in her analysis.<br />Ms. Newburg also twists facts  (unwittingly or wittingly) to suit her theory.  The introduction of her  book (page 1) has a glaring omission.  I quote, \\"...in 1947, the ruling Hindu  maharajah committed his predominantly Muslim subjects to India.  Tribal  leaders from Paksitan crossed into Kashmir (with the blessings of the new  Pakistan government) but stopped short of Srinigar\\".  What is completely  missing from the description is the fact that the Hindu maharajah had not  acceded to either India or Pakistan at the time.  Only when faced with an  armed invasion by Pakistan, did he seek India's help.  India was willing to  commit her troops, but only after the matter of accession had been settled.   In the end, the matter of accession was settled, when the maharajah chose  to accede to India, and Indian troops came to his aid.  India's act was  fully legal - as borne out by the various UN resolutions that Pakistan  keeps referring to, which require Pakistan to first evacuate its armed  forces from all of Kashmir.  By reversing the chronological sequence of  events, Ms. Newburg obfuscates the issues, in a manner that repeats itself  throughout the book.	1999-10-27

I struggled through the book to the very end (only because I am  from India).  Others would likely have put it down much sooner.<br />Neville  Maxwell's 'India's China War' is a much better written book on a related  subject.  (I suspect because Maxwell was a journalist, and Cloughley a  bureaucrat and brought vastly different writing skills to bear).<br />The  author makes brash assertions (e.g. Morarji Desai was a traitor, a CIA  spy!) without even bothering to back this up with a reliable source or  reference.  This results in a general loss of credibility throughout the  book.  In another instance, the author quotes an extract from Henry  Kissinger's book without attributing it to him.  It took me considerable  effort to figure out the context of the quote and its origin.  Things like  this make it VERY confusing for the reader.<br />At places, the book has  tables on such arcane topics as defense expenditures by year, numbers of  tanks, artillery pieces, etc. that contribute to the difficulty in  reading.<br />The maps and pictures are of poor quality.<br />I would have rated  this book one star, but since it is the only one about the Pakistan Army, I  felt compelled to be a little more charitable.	1999-10-11

As a senior civil servant, he was close to all the decision-makers (from Ayub Khan to Ghulam  Ishaq Khan).  I feel that he is a very honest man who is just as critical  of himself as he is of others.  If there were more like him in Pakistan, I  believe that Pakistan would have been a better country to live in.   Relations with India would also have been better, although Mr. Khan does  not dwell upon Pakistan's foreign relations.<br />Some quotes from the book  are telling - &quot;...This is not the country I opted for in the Referendum  held in my home province of the NWFP in 1947, and this is not the country I  would like to die in.  I badly want a Pakistan to defend, a nation I can  belong to, fight for, and die for...These days our country is collapsing into  itself...Pakistan today is a land of opportunities for corrupt, unscrupulous,  unprincipled politicians, corrupt and dishonest civil servants, smugglers  and tax evaders...&quot;<br />The book lacks consistency (contextual and  editorial) and is at times boring with lengthy legal documents prepared by  Mr. Khan in his various capacities in the Pakistan government.
