This is a \\"take your breath away\\" novel centered on the lynching of a Black man.  The scene is set as Marcus Murray gets an unexpected but needed vacation from his job.  As he sets out to drive back home, fear penetrates his thoughts as Blacks are not welcomed in the \\"dirty south\\".  A few miles outside of his destination he is forcefully removed from his vehicle, beaten, and hung.  The fifteen KKK members take things a step further by celebrating and commemorating the moment by posing for a picture by the body.  Well, that is only the beginning for this crime novel filled with revenge, suspense, and terror. <br /> <br />Thirty years later, Special Agent Kenny \\"KC\\" Carson, an ex NFL superstar, is given the difficult task of finding the murderer of the next presidential hopeful, Senator Robert Cowens.  The gruesome murder scene produces more questions than answers.  KC discovers the Senator is the ninth person from the photo to pay for crimes of the past.  KC assembles a team of top-notch FBI detectives to solve the mystery locked in the faces of the picture.  KC is not his usual one-step before the killer self because he is running from his own demons that threaten to destroy him.  As he sifts through the crime scene searching for clues, the killer strikes again.  Will KC be able to find the killer before everyone on the picture is dead?  You will have to read this thriller to find out. <br /> <br />A MOMENT OF JUSTICE: A LIFETIME OF VENGEANCE is a stellar piece of literary genius destined to be a national bestseller.  Wooden writes with a passion that provides a booklover with a look inside racism, governmental cover-up, unconventional family bonds, and injustice which will intrigue readers by all walks of life.  The plot is well developed and original which continually throws curve balls keeping your eyes glued to the pages.  There are a host of characters involved, some you will love and others you will hate but everyone has motive to kill.   <br /> <br />As I read the first pages of the novel, anger took over as I quickly turned page after page to find out what happened next.  Slowly, my anger changed to disbelief as I begin to realize that many of the people involved with lynchings just like this one are still walking amongst us today.  Hmmm...is this fact or fiction?  Makes you wonder, what really made the KKK go underground.  I can't wait for Wooden's next novel, as he truly has a gift from God. <br /> <br />Reviewed by M.

Busted is a fast-paced drama about relationships, love, and revenge involving three women and one man.  Arianna Singleton recently relocated to Philadelphia to step up her career as an investigative journalist.  Nicole Harris is a church-going executive who works with a PR firm in Maryland.  Janelle Carter is a plus size sista who owns and operates a thriving hair salon in Virginia.  These women do not know each other but have a lot in common. They are all successful, black, females looking for Mr. Right - on the internet.   <br /> <br />These technologically savvy women log onto a new black dating website, LoveMeBlack.com, in search of the man of their dreams.  One by one they get emails from the suave, poetry writing, islander, Chauncey.  Chauncey is just what they are looking for - a handsome, smooth talking, gentleman.  Chauncey has ladies around the world eating out of the palm of his hands while he cons them into footing the bills he racks up. <br /> <br />Each get caught up in a web of love and lies as they discover they are all dating the same man.  Arianna is self-centered and wants a man with a perfect body while she might let Mr. Alright slip through her hands.  Nicole compromises her faith to satisfy Mr. Fine online.  While Janelle, low on self-esteem uses her money to hold on to Mr. Needy.  Once Nicole gets fed up with Mr. Fine online, she discovers his address book and gets to work.  That's how the three ladies meet and begin to plot revenge on Chauncey. <br /> <br />Busted is a new twist on the adventures of black women scorned.  I believe the idea of meeting Mr. Right online is the new rave in 2005.  Personally, I couldn't do it myself but one of my close friends did find love in a chat room.  The subtitle of the novel says it all - \\"Never underestimate a sista's revenge\\" - because we will take it to another level.   <br /> <br />Reviewed by M.

My new mantra: Be all you can be, just don't join the Army.  Listen to the Tom Joyner Morning Show (TJMS) instead.  I'M JUST A DJ BUT...demonstrates how Joyner is rich is spirit, advice and generosity. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Believe it or not, Tom Joyner didn't wake up one day and suddenly realize he is a millionaire, he worked hard for his money and still does.  In fact, his slogan is: \\"The hardest working man in radio, the fly jock Tom Joyner\\" holds a lot of truth.  He dedicated countless hours of service, even when he wasn't sure about what he was doing; to always (not sometimes) make a good impression. He is \\"fly\\" because he once flew daily from Chicago to Dallas to work on two radio stations.  Talk about dedication to the profession. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Joyner speaks openly about issues with his weight, the road to syndication, marriage, parenting, the Tom Joyner Foundation, his crew, his commitment to Black people and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  In fact, he's received plenty of backlashes for wanting to help ONLY Black people.  Why not cater to your people?  I imagine him on his soapbox, preaching his gospel to those who didn't agree and saying something like, \\"oh well, I'm going to do it anyway.\\"  Now that's a man who is comfortable with whom he is, no airs about him.  Money didn't change him; it only changed how he spent it. He had a plan; he stuck to it and is now reaping the benefits of his labor. Sure, he made some mistakes along the way, but to err is to be human.  Consistency is learned by seeing and doing.  It's cyclical and it's up to you to keep the wheels turning and passing on the lessons and good habits.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />There are so many lessons obtained from reading I'M JUST A DJ BUT...  In this book, Joyner reiterates points he's always talking about on his morning show.  The pages are dog-eared and highlighted and soon to be passed on to my teenager. Don't sleep on good advice, even if it doesn't give a fool-proof plan on how to get more money.  This is not about how to get rich quick; it's about how to work hard to get what you want and how to maintain it once you have it. Keeping a leveled head helps too. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-09-21

Secret Jones was born in the shadow of a conspiracy that involved the entire town.  She is being raised by her Aunt May and constantly asks her about her mother.  Suddenly, Aunt May dies, leaving Secret to live with her distant and abusive Aunt Janie.  Secret survives years of physical, mental, and spiritual abuse at the hands of Aunt Janie and is considered an outcast by most of the town people.  By chance, a vengeful school nurse gives Secret her first real lead into where her mother may be living. <br />The search for her mother leads Secret to places adults would think twice about going.  The journey leads her to discover strange family members, rattles the moral fiber of the town, and introduces Secret to her first love.  As the saying goes, \\"what doesn't kill you makes you stronger\\" and is definitely true in her case.  Secret's pilgrimage allows her to capture self-respect, inner strength, and dignity while discovering the whole truth. <br /> <br />Cornelius did a stunning job in her debut novel, unfolding a tragic tale about graphic physical abuse and rape of children.  Even though the story starts out slow, Secret's quest for truth will keep you turning the pages to find out for yourself.  The character development and plot twists were superb, while the ending left me in awe and wonder.  I was unclear as to the time period in which the story was set as Cornelius went from old model cars to double dutch jump roping.  All in all, you can't go wrong with discovering this family's deepest, darkest secret. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Monique for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-09-21

After a drug deal gone bad, Pashen's boyfriend/supplier threatens her life. To keep her mom alive, Hailee offers herself to the drug kingpin and he graciously accepts.

When he becomes ill, guess who's at his bedside? <br /> <br />All of these women, though weathering different storms, share a common link. Discovering their heavenly bond will forever change their lives. <br /> <br />Help Wanted is a dynamic debut. At a time when street fiction is ever popular, this novel provides a nice change of pace. The author mixed Christian themes with urban issues and in so doing created a refreshing read. At times, the transitions from one characters voice to the angel's are abrupt and have the potential to confuse readers. That withstanding, I highly recommend this book. Shawan Lewis is definitely an author to watch. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Joan Burke Stanford for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-09-21

It seems whenever the protagonist Stephen is determined to make the decision to tell Liza his feelings, he's either involved in a melee or he ends up sleeping with another woman.  He can't keep his hands to himself or his penis in his pants.  Those are just two of his downfalls; the others are his need for 7-Eleven brand merlots and his dependency on medication.  His libations: Prozac caf (coffee after taking Prozac) in the morning and a Lithium cocktail (a bottle of merlot after taking Lithium) in the evening. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Stephen gives recaps of all his adventures in first person singular. There are three sides to every story, yours, theirs and the truth...and this is Stephen's side of the truth.  As an ex-boxer, he settles all disputes the old-fashioned way, with his fists.  He's willing to fight anyone in Liza's honor.  She is beautiful and men can't keep their eyes off her or their comments to themselves.  That's disrespectful and the main reason Stephen doesn't have any male friends, except Hardy.  It's time someone knew what drove him to this point.  He wants you to know he can commit to Liza and agree to marry her.  First, he has to stop his harem of women from throwing a monkey wrench in his plan when he least expects it.  This may be his last opportunity to do it right.  He was Liza's knight in shining armor and with every turn he's suddenly becoming the dark knight who should just go away.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />It's like an amazing race to get to Liza and finally prove how much he loves her.  Stephen's desperately trying to convince anyone who's willing to listen, how committed he can be to Liza.  This is his last chance. He promises not to mess it up this time.  The other times were just a test; this is the real thing, for real.  After all the begging, pleading and fighting will Stephen finally get his woman, Liza?   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Issues!  That's what Stephen has.  Chatman delivered this one with candor and a raw humor the average person may not get.  It takes a certain level of wit to truly understand his sarcasm.  I wanted him to digress but he wouldn't and I kept reading because the story is so addictive it kept me drawn into the drama.  At some point you sympathize with this character.  Other times you want to slap him and tell him to move the hell on.  I really enjoyed this book.

Instead, it is a jumbled collection of adventures between several characters which were somewhat repetitive, unoriginal and not at all sensual. <br /> <br />Davon Delaquan is a hard-working and intelligent, but short of receiving his associate's degree, he decides to drop out of college and work at an automotive plant.  He's also a musician and poet who utilizes these skills to work in a local night club, garnering the eye of many women in the neighborhood.  As with most books of this nature, he has his sidekicks and also an older mentor of sorts who schools the young man on how to live life, treat women, and demand rights from his employer.  These characters deal with drama in the workplace, at home, and on the streets, yet the ending is no different from the beginning for many of them. <br /> <br />While Larry Love's concept of comparing an automotive plant to a plantation was interesting, the book didn't deliver on showing the growth of the characters or why they really acted the way they did.  The dialogue is stiff, the characters are one-dimensional, and the editing is lacking in Plantation Temptation.  There are also several subplots throughout the book which are all overshadowed by the characters' need to have sex and cheat on the various women with whom they are involved.  Combined, these things made the book a cumbersome and disappointing read.   I couldn't understand why the characters repetitively went through the same issues at the work place and in their \\"love\\" lives.  They seemed to be free-styling through life with no worries of the consequences. <br />Reviewed by Miz Melody for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-08-02

These three poems are insightful and direct, but also inspiring; and only a small representation of this book. <br /> <br />Haskins has written a thought-provoking collection of poetry and essays which makes one reflect on life; the good and the bad. Furthermore, he has done so in a smooth-flowing manner in which the reader is captured into the movement of his words, the power of their meaning, and the knowledge gained as a result of reading the book. He doesn't write in any one particular rhyme or cadence, but mixes the various types of poetry to present a well-rounded ensemble that is easy to read, yet would be even more powerful as spoken word.

The person we are involved with keeps hurting us, yet we keep going back for more of the same hurt.  What compels a person to continue suffering heartbreak?  What's the saying?  It takes a minute to fall in love and a lifetime to forget, or something like that.  Sadira Cooper tells the story best. <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />She is a lesbian seeking love and to be loved.  Often times she has pity parties wondering what's so wrong with her that makes people leave her.  In all her self-reflection she ends up with the same answer: none at all.  Sadira meets Jessie and her life changes.  She loves her, she loves her not.  Everyone tells Sadira that Jessie is selfish, self-centered and she should cut her off like a bad habit.  Sadira knows this but refuses to accept it.  Instead, she continues to shower Jessie with her undying love in hopes to make her come around, so to speak.  Ultimately they end up together as a couple.  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />People only do to you what you allow them to do.  If you suffer heartbreak from the same person all the time, it's because you allowed that person to continue hurting you.  The challenge keeps you going back, in hopes to \\"change\\" the person and make them realize that you really do love them.  You want that person to open their eyes and see your love, as if you're wearing it like a piece of clothing.  INTIMATE CHAOS takes you through the journey of trying to find love.

As I begin to read, a wave of pride washed over me as I realized that finally a black man is starting to seek out the opinions from \\"strong black women\\". <br /> <br />Thompkin's spent over a year interviewing hundreds of women and men documenting their ideas and feelings about \\"strong black women\\".  His study was driven by his desire to uplift and acknowledge black women, as they are too often misunderstood and undercelebrated.  Amen to that!  The chapters are structured around the different types of love - romantic, platonic and self-love.  The reader is asked to reexamine their lives according to the questions from the different types of love that make up a love pie.  Thompkins suggests that by shifting your reality from \\"wonder women\\" to \\"woman of faith, love and joy\\" you can cut a bigger piece of love pie.   <br /> <br />THE REAL LIVES OF STRONG BLACK WOMEN explores several topics central to black women's lives.  Thompkins organizes his findings across key areas:  emotional abandonment, spirituality as a source of strength, creating a meaningful life, straight and lesbian relationships and dating.  An entire chapter is devoted to the male perspective on strong black women.  Attention-grabbing tips are presented for improving mother/daughter relationships, which offer simple ideas to mend the bond and erase generational curses.  Each chapter has personal testimonies to illustrate healing can occur if black women start to care for themselves.  Every chapter ends with an affirmation and questions to consider before reading further. <br /> <br />Thompkins has complied a superb resource for readers who are attempting to understand the \\"strong blackwomen\\".  The reading is interesting and easy to comprehend.  The strategies, concepts, and ideas cross all gender and socioeconomic boundaries while providing simple ways to apply to your life.  Thanks Toby Thompkins for reaffirming the positive aspects of \\"strong black women\\". <br />Reviewed by M. Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-07-07

He became a single father after his wife suddenly abandoned him when the girls were only six-months young.  Auntie Millie - Everson's sister - immediately stepped in and became their surrogate mother. The first shoe drops when the twins, Milan and Paris, lose their father.   <br />  <br />Milan and Paris are thrust into continuing their father's legacy and faced with running the ad agency with little to no experience.  The second shoe drops when, shortly after taking ownership of the agency, a disgruntled client shows up and causes chaos.  The twins begin to realize this was only one of many more problems to come.  They consult with their lawyer and aunt to try to figure a way out of their predicaments. <br /> <br />Just when they reach their wit's end, another shoe drops...they lose one of their biggest clients and now have to figure out how to make payroll and not have to lay-off valuable employees.  Suddenly, a knight in shining armor, named Sydney presents the twins with a deal that's hard to refuse.  Or should they?  It seems a Hispanic ad agency based in Dallas wants to give them the capital to stay afloat; however the agency does not want to consider it a merger or acquisition.  The whole concept seems strange to everyone involved...except the person initiating the deal. <br /> <br />THE OTHER SHOE DROPPED kept the shoes dropping left and right and just when you think Graham has run out of shoes, he drops an even larger pair.  It is suspense and romance neatly tied together.  Graham keeps you intrigued with the ongoing plot, although at some point I found it predictable.  Nevertheless that didn't make it less enjoyable; it kept me reading to see if my prediction was actually right. <br /> <br /> Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-06-30

Please Stand Up!	\\"Wave ya hands in the air and shake`em like you just don't care.\\"  These are words often used to hype the crowd for hip-hop concerts around the country.  I found myself singing the same tune as I read this remarkable tribute to African American culture, hip-hop and feminism.  Pough does an exceptional job of researching the roots of black women in the hip-hop phenomena, which has swept the world and become embedded in its very foundation.  The hip-hop culture is broken down and explained through the lens of black women detailing how it has changed and how women are viewed.  She traces the rhetoric of  women in all hip-hop genres: urban literature, rap & soul music, development of the spoken word, and black film.  The essence of the title, Pough explains is how black women bring \\"wreck\\" which is a form of praise to describe the \\"skill and greatness\\" of the lyrics.<br /><br />Do you know the great women of hip-hop?  You should take the time to sit down with this account of rap legends - Roxanne Shante, Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Yo Yo, Salt-N-Pepa and many more.  You will learn about Sylvia Robinson, the owner of Sugar Hill Records, break-dancer Baby Love, and poet lyricist Jessica Care Moore and Sista Soulja.  Pough uses the work and dedication of these women to help readers understand how women are portrayed in hip-hop.  She reaches back to Sojourner Truth preaching black power and equal rights use then leaps forward to Queen Latifah performing socially conscious rap and Salt-N-Pepa exuding sexuality in their breakout lyrics.  From the stereotypical roles of \\"mammy\\" to the present day images of \\"chickenhead\\", black women have used rap music to outline their life, reconfigure their identities, and breakdown the historical stereotypes and negative images that male rappers have constructed.<br /><br />Pough has provided the world with a well-researched, provocative account of hip-hop culture and the women who have added to its success.  Readers can relive the development of hip-hop and sing the songs, remember the films, dances and slang made popular starting from the early 1970's to the present.  This is a must-have book for every hip-hop lover, feminist, or African American studies student/department.  The issues discussed in this book will provide hours of discussion for anyone who reads it.  Pough has brought \\"wreck\\" to the area of academia.<br /><br />Reviewed by M.

In her debut novel, UPSTATE, Buckhanon immediately sets the tone with a splash of suspense in the very first line: \\"Baby, the first thing I need to know from you is do you believe I killed my father?\\" {page 3}  <br /> <br />Written as ongoing letters between Natasha and Antonio, two teenagers experiencing their first love, UPSTATE captures candid, raw emotion of the lovebirds and their ten-year challenging journey through life while Antonio is incarcerated. One day Antonio's biggest dilemma is passing Mr. Cook's English class and the next it's surviving being sent upstate, where he's serving time for the murder of his own father. <br /> <br />In his heartfelt letters, Antonio often expresses his undying love and lust for Natasha. He also describes what he's going through in jail, from suspecting officers of reading his letters to feelings of isolation and fear.  <br /> <br />\\"I feel alone, like I'm on the outside of the world looking in. Like a rocket ship going to the moon, staring out of the cockpit window at the earth; I'm gonna die in here. I'm so alone, I'm gonna die.\\" {page 63} <br /> <br />Natasha responds, professing her love, encouraging her man and keeping him up to date on all that is going on at school and with their friends. She also shares her feelings of sadness and loneliness. A particularly sad instance was her having to go to the prom without a date. <br /> <br />As time goes on, the frequency of their letters decreases and the two begin to mature. Antonio pursues a GED while locked up and Natasha visits Paris on a student program and later goes to college. Challenges begin to mount as time and separation test their love. <br /> <br />While UPSTATE is indeed a beautiful, creative work, I had a couple issueswith it. Granted, it is a good, solid read but not necessarily a well-rounded story. Although, letters provide intimate discourse and _expression of one's innermost feelings, they also can be limiting, forcing an author to leave out parts of a story and viewpoints other than those of the letter writers. While I enjoyed the fresh spin of urban fiction, I longed for real interaction and dialogue from other characters, such as Antonio's mother. I had a strong desire to know more about this woman and what drove her frame of mind, before her son went to prison and after. Also, it might be a minor inconsistency, but was the character's name Antonio Michael or Michael Antonio? Nonetheless, UPSTATE is truly a moving tale about love, loss, sacrifice and survival. I look forward to the next creation from this literary artist. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Joan Burke Stanford for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-06-28

Scott-Blanton gives the readers a bird's-eye view from a woman's perspective and through countless interviews she tells Annette's story.  Annette has decided to come forward and let other women know that even with having blatant signs, how other factors can still cloud one's judgments.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Annette and James were high school sweethearts who turned into college lovers and eventually marry.  The twist: Annette is bisexual but has not had an experience with another woman, yet.  She decides her relationship should be based on trust and tells James about her desire.  James openly accepts her sexuality and suggests they have her first experience together; they do and eventually venture into the \\"swinging\\" lifestyle.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Annette is enjoying the openness in her relationship with James, but feels something isn't right.  While she is having her cake and eating it too, he is dealing with his own issues and secret attraction to men.  Suddenly he starts making odd sexual requests.  At first she's not comfortable with them, but eventually gives in to his desires.  At some point, James's behavior becomes erratic so Annette decides to become a sleuth and does some investigating.  Having a \\"need to know\\" mentality, she betrays the trust in their marriage and reads her husband's journal.  What she reads almost becomes her demise; it's a double-edged sword.  Annette struggles with what to do with the information she now has on her husband.  Are you ready for her emotional roller-coaster ride?  What would you do if you found out your mate is on the \\"down low?\\" <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Question: Is he really \\"on the down low\\" if you know about it?  Isn't the whole premise to being \\"down low\\" not knowing? Perhaps the book would have been better titled \\"My Husband Was on the Down Low...But Now I Know.\\"  In telling Annette's story, Scott-Blanton's attempt was good.  There were some issues with dialogue, grammar, typos and editing.  There was almost an entire chapter dedicated to the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell, which was overkill on the subject.  In a nutshell, I can't help wonder if women are being poisoned by books on this particular subject and making them paranoid into believing most men have \\"down low\\" tendencies. Perhaps. Some may even feel there's not enough on the subject.  Either way, I digress.   <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays with Loose Leaves Book Review <br /> <br />	2005-05-05

But unlike the menacing kid the movie Home Alone characterizes, Cameron Johnson is a quiet teenager living in the projects. He's just trying to boil some water, using an electric skillet, so he can take a bath because once again his mother has not paid the gas bill. It has been a few days since he's seen his crack-addicted mother, who is always out searching for her next hit. At least, that's what he thinks until a white woman and a police officer take him into custody and explain that his mother has been picked up in a vacant crack house and arrested for outstanding theft warrants. For Cameron, this proves to be just the beginning of Things in Between.  <br />After two months in a children's home, he's finally sent to live with Momma D, an aunt who lives in Alabama. She teaches him how to use good manners, how to speak proper English, instead of slang, and constantly reiterates the value of education and saving money. When his fresh-from-rehab mother demands that he move back home with her, his world is turned upside down, and his absentee father, who lives in the same city with his wife and twin daughters, refuses to provide Cameron with any fatherly support. It's his best friend, Rayshawn,who encourages Cameron to follow his dreams and to make something out of his life. <br />His struggles intensify in college when he is forced to use paycheck advances to pay his utility bills. Witnessing a brutal homicide and his mother's relapse, trying to make ends meet and making the grades becomes a daunting task. Nevertheless, the ambitious engineering student is determined to persevere. <br />Nathanial Portis's debut is a touching tale about one young man's fervent effort to overcome \\"things in between\\"  that are standing in the way of his success. With believable characters faced with true-to-life situations, Things In Between is an engaging read. Readers will feel Cameron's pain and cheer his triumphs. The author accurately paints the financial dilemma many college students endure--the challenge of maintaining passing grades while holding down a part-time job. Portis also weaves in an element of suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat. He's definitely an author to watch and I look forward to reading his future works. <br />Reviewed by Joan Burke Stanford for Loose Leaves Book Review with an actual rating of 3.5 stars	2005-05-04

The one thing she doesn't have is a husband.  Nikki is sick and tired of people asking when she is going to settle down and get married.  She wants to take back her life and be able to focus on herself and take her job to the next level.  After careful deliberation she decides to sneak off and marry an \\"invisible husband\\" in Las Vegas.  Nikki has it all planned out until she meets Byron. <br /> <br />In this game of charades she fools everyone.  Her co-workers plan her a bridal shower, family set up a welcome home congratulations dinner, and her girlfriends arrange a bachlorette party.  In a feverish rush to cover all the lies she has told, she decides to let Byron in on the \\"invisible husband\\" story.  Byron buys into it so he can be closer to Nikki.  The one thing he fails to reveal is his psycho ex-girlfriend, Tara.  Does Bryon really love Nikki or is he trying to get back at Tara? <br /> <br />My Invisible Husband flows quickly from one scene to the next, entertaining the reader with comic relief and \\"no she didn't\\" thoughts.  Even though the entire story is based on a lie, morality is the lesson learned.  The character development and interaction was down-to-earth while the story line did have areas that were a bit unbelievable.  There are a few grammatical errors and confusion surrounding Nikki's name (Nicolette doesn't show up until page 55).  My Invisible Husband is drama filled and certain to keep you reading. <br /> <br />Reviewed by M. Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-05-04

Tricia Rose turns academic research into a literary masterpiece.  She interviewed 20 African American females with various ethnic backgrounds, broad range of age, and socioeconomic upbringing.  Rose organized the real life commentaries on sex, intimacy, relationships, and race into a narrative that will carry you through a broad range of emotions.  The women speak truth to situations that happen in every day life but are considered taboo in the African American community. <br />Rose starts the book with a discussion about the negative stereotypes in regards to sex and intimacy that are portrayed about the African American female in the media.  The purpose of the book was developed as an attempt to answer the question, \\"how has the history of race, class, and gender inequality in this country affected the way that black women talk about their sexual lives?\\"  Rose answered this question and much more.  Longing to Tell is a mirror image of African American female sexuality in contemporary society as well as an oral history that serves as a vibrant presentation for everyday readers and scholars alike. <br />The stories are captured and categorized into three different areas: Through the Fire; Guarded Heart; and Always Something Left to Love.  The women, whose names and locations have been changed to protect their anonymity, openly discuss their sexual history; how they learned about sex, masturbation, orgasms, and experience of first menstruation, virginity, pregnancy, and motherhood; sexual abuse, rape, sexism, sexual fantasy and sexual orientation.  Some of the tales in the book are horrendous such as incest, rape, domestic abuse and sexual harassment but while knocked down these women were not knocked out.  Many tell about the love from friends, family and at times even the smiles of strangers brought them back from the depths of despair.  The stories are all different and engaging as their experiences were dynamic while thought provoking.  Does your definition ofsexuality characterize how you live life? <br />Longing To Tell is an extraordinary account on how African American women survive despite the incredible odds against them.  As an adjunct professor of African American Studies, I highly recommend this book as a study into the mind of black women.  As an avid reader, I strongly encourage you to read this book as a motivational guide on finding your way out of the struggle.  African American women are the cornerstones of modern society and this book proves that! <br />Reviewed by M. Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-05-04

Many may not need to follow the guide verbatim because some things may not apply. The tips start with evaluating your financial situation.  Khalfani suggests writing it down, because once you see, in writing, how much debt you have then you can start your blueprint to becoming debt free.  Visualize what's causing the undo stress in your money worrying woes.  The next and most important step is to determine \\"how\\" you're going to get rid of the debt.  This is where the pitfall begins.  Most think, \\"If I don't have money to pay the debt, where am I going to get extra money to pay more on the debt?\\"  The answer: Simplify your life.  What does that mean?  Get rid of those things you think you need (i.e. cellular phones, expensive cars, weekly hairdos, cable TV, etc.).  Once you've completed the first two steps, the rest is easy.  The first step is always the hardest. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Zero Debt explains financial jargon like: FICO, IRA, adjusted rate, 401(k), etc. before information on the subject is presented.  Regardless of your level of debt, you'll find some useful tips in this easy-to-read book.  In short, here are some of the basics to experiencing Zero Debt and financial freedom.  Evaluate debt.  Stop creditors.  Talk to your creditors and let them know what's happening. Get rid of the unnecessary; stick with the necessary.  Pay more on debt.  Check your credit yearly.  Check your FICO scores.  Write letters disputing discrepancies on your credit report.  Don't write the credit reporting agencies; write the creditors directly.  Start a budget and stick to it.  Consistency.  Start a savings plan by making small deposits, and gradually increase them as your debt decreases.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />I like Khalfani's approach to becoming debt-free.  Most of what she wrote, I've already heard; however, hearing it again didn't hurt.  Sure this book is not going to solve your money problem; only you can.  But you have to make a concerted effort to stick to the program.  The only suggestion, from the author, I don't recommend is going into a debt-consolidation program.  Why pay someone to do what you can do yourself with a simple phone call?  Think about it.  What makes a stranger asking to reduce your interest rate more credible than you, the customer, calling to ask the same question?  Not to mention, sometimes those services damage your credit rating.  Hmm, something to ponder. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-04-13

The fast-paced drama begins with Charles Jennings having romantic daydreams about his sister-in-law while attending his brother's funeral. Yes, you heard me right. <br /> <br />Charles has it all - exquisite home, fancy cars, a steady job and is the lead singer of The Mighty Spirituals Quartet.  Charles is a vibrant, middle-aged man who can't live without the constant touch of a woman.  So much so he has been married four times and has had countless affairs.  What does a man with it all have to lose? <br /> <br />Scandalous pushes the envelope on revenge as Charles' brother, Gregg, vows to kill him during a vision at the gravesite.  Charles can't seem to release the guilt of having a long-term affair with Katie, his sister-in-law, even though they made torrid love at the repast.  Bettie, Charles' second wife, left when she discovered he had been sleeping with her closest friend and sister, Keshundra.  Although Keshundra was young, she taught Charles a thing or two.  If you think this is a little over the top, you should read the rest.  The drama that unfolds as Charles does his thing with every woman in town is absolutely unbelievable yet intriguing; I couldn't put the book down. <br /> <br />I read in awe how ReChella developed the characters in such a way I thought they belonged in my neighborhood.  The originality of the storyline and unexpected twists kept me turning the pages of this semi-erotic melodrama.  ReChella's debut novel is one of the best urban-lit books I've read.  There is a new author in town, ReChella. <br /> <br />Reviewed by M. Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-04-13

At least, that's what she thinks until she stumbles upon Chris, with whom she has an instantaneous attraction.  For Chris, it's the exact same thing; he's smitten with Celine, and feels meeting her is the best thing to have happened to him. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />These two embark upon a whirlwind romance based on caring, sharing and getting to know one another - no strings attached, no heartbreaks and definitely no drama.  Although the original plan, things get a little bit sticky when Chris encounters his ex-girlfriend at a club and sleeps with her, days after proposing to Celine.  Celine finds out the truth and vows never to speak to or see Chris again.  Will she be able to keep her promise, knowing this is the only man she has ever truly loved? <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Sheria is Celine's best friend and confidante.  She's very promiscuous, dealing with anyone and practically anything.  Although she is a very good person, she has many issues to handle on her own and seeks solace in all the wrong places.  It takes a real man and a life-threatening situation to calm her down and help her to realize that love never comes when you look for it, but lies in wait for the right time... <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Lusting for Love had a couple of storylines that didn't mesh too well and seemed confusing at times.  It also needed proper editing; there were a lot of grammatical, stylistic and typographical errors which detracted from the storyline a great deal.  The novel read as though there were two different stories combined into one, providing a constant conflict and lacking important details.  With more character development and a little streamlining, this story could have been a lot better.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by T. Belinda Williams for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-04-11

Anisha promises God she will invest more time into her relationship with Him then Tyson Randall called turning her world upside down. <br /> <br />Anisha and Tyson initially met at church.  He was everything she prayed for in a man - honest, good-looking, goal-oriented, and most important, had a relationship with the Lord.

She drew me into this tale from the first page and kept my attention until the very end.  Grihm has entered into a new arena for the literary world as she blends truth with fiction.  The characters are revealing such emotional detail, you either fall deeply in love or hate them immensely.  The story includes time travel, human to animal transformation, personal emotional devastation, and much more.  Let me step back and give you a synopsis of the storyline. <br /> <br />Sarissa first encounters the wolf in a dream.  The wolf protects her from an approaching man whom she senses will do her harm.  A series of strange events link the past to the present and Sarissa realizes that she is not content with how she is living.  Her passion is directing a modeling troupe called, the Panche Models.  During one of the weekly auditions, Anaghia her ancestor and spiritual interpreter, physically joins Sarissa in this mystical voyage.  After Sarissa's first transformation into the Wolf, her senses are enhanced and creativity sparked.  Sarissa realizes that her husband is unfaithful, her co-worker is mentally unstable, and friends are out to end her life.  Then Anaghia takes Sarissa back in time to interpret an recurring dream that will uncover the purpose of why things are they way they are. <br /> <br />Grihm writes in a genre of her own.  She connects romance to science fiction, touches on various cultures, and adds in the strength and depth of feminism.  While reading The Wolf, I kept asking myself is this truth or fiction, because of the vivid pictures the words painted in my head.  I guess it is what Grihm meant when she noted, \\"this is a work of fiction based on truth.\\"  If you are looking for a read out of the ordinary, this jewel is for you.  Grihm, I'm ready for the sequel. <br /> <br />Reviewed by M. Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review <br /> <br />	2005-03-28

Up walks Mr. Playa Playa shooting unsolicited game and when asked nicely to leave, he still doesn't get a clue.  Maxine Styles isn't trying to hear another word and lets him have a piece of her mind.  Little does he know, Maxine has found out some rather disturbing things about the man she was dating and ended their relationship.  The last thing she wants is another man in her face.  <br /> <br />Maxine removes men from her equation and is focused on being the top agent at her marketing firm.  She's still hurt over her past relationships and isn't interested in removing the wall built around her feelings.  Then she meets Justice Dane, president of one of the companies her firm wants to secure as a client.  Immediately there is an attraction, yet they hide behind their professional fronts.  That is until Justice decides to ask Maxine out -- the beginning of a beautiful love affair.  But hold up; there has to be some drama.  Maxine's crazy ex reappears and a woman at Justice's work place is set on having him.  Will the two cause chaos between the lovers? Or will Maxine's fears of past failed relationships do them in? <br /> <br />Lawton writes a very sweet love story with a somewhat predictable ending. Being a romantic at heart, it's always wonderful to read books like this, especially with men who exhibit loving qualities.  But I expected more character development and wanted closure in a few areas in the book.  While it was a quick read, everything was just a little too neat once the final page was turned.  The conflict in The Sweetest Hangover is common in a lot of relationships; it just wasn't climatic enough.  <br />Reviewed by Mz Melody for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-02-23

Lewis is a tribute to the ultimate love story depicted in the Bible between Joseph and Mary.  It is a fictionalized story of one of the greatest loves known, yet with a twist.  Lewis has taken the story and brought it to the 21st Century.  As told in the Bible, Mary, a virgin, is carrying the child of God and shares the news with Joseph, the man she plans to marry.  He accepts the gift and helps raise Jesus as his own child, yet he has feelings of inadequacy and questions if he can even compare his love to that of God.  The story continues through Jesus' life and Joseph's death, with the focus on the love and relationship between Joseph and Mary. <br /> <br />This is one of those books that may leave a big question mark once finished.  While I knew the story from my teachings of the Bible, I still felt a bit weird reading a fictionalized account, with dialogue to match.  It didn't seem quite right in a way, but I did enjoy reading the story for the most part.  I would have liked to have seen more interaction between Joseph and Mary. <br /> <br />The dialogue, while perhaps close to the story, seemed a bit forced and simplistic at times.  The characters were not given the depth needed to fully carry off this revised version of the story.  Overall, it was okay, but I think the book would be better served as a teaching aide to those not familiar with the Bible instead of a stand-alone story.  To someone who studies the Bible, the story may be viewed as blasphemous. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Mz. Melody for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-02-09

In fact, he keeps enough money in her bank account for her to live comfortably and to support her father who suffers from Alzheimer's and lives in a nursing home. To Sarai \\"insufficient funds\\" are words she and her best friend use to describe men who are lacking in terms of inches down below. Certainly, insufficient could never describe the funds she has.  <br />That is until she and Damian break up publicly (during a phone conversation while she was unknowingly on the air at work), and things change for the worst. Of course she is fired from the radio station, and because of the incident, other stations will not even entertain the idea of hiring her. Damian withdraws all of the money he had deposited into her account. Now, her $1400 rent is due, as well as other numerous bills and student loans. Suddenly she has to face the harsh reality that she is \\"going broke.    <br />She goes to the Bahamas on a trip she had planned and paid for a month prior. By chance, she meets an older gentleman and some of his business partners. When a night out with one of the partners yields her big cash, her moral values come into question. Could this be the end of all her financial woes? What will her friends think? She certainly can't tell her twin, Savion, about this \\"job.\\"    <br />Going Broke, the debut novel by Trista Russell, is excellent. Although I wanted to learn more about Sarai's twin and see the subplot surrounding him developed a little more, the storywas hot. The author masterfully combined a chick lit storyline with a \\"street\\" edge. By adding explicit sex scenes and a few unexpected twists, Russell has really penned a top-rate tale. Never have I read a book with three alternative endings, but I think Russell pulled it off with ease. She brings a creative new voice to the urban fiction scene and I simply cannot wait to see what she will deliver next.   <br />Reviewed by Joan Burke Stanford for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-02-07

Lookin' in the Mirror gives you an honest, open view on the new age of dating and discovering love through the Internet.  The storyline is based around two central characters, Victoria and Gerald.  This comical view of dating will keep you laughing and interested in who is dating who. <br /> <br />Victoria resides in Washington D.C. and is a \\"tell-it-like-it-is\\" type of woman.  She reminds me of Robin Givens' character from the movie Boomerang - a power-driven female who works hard to get what she deserves and discards what she doesn't need.  Victoria writes a weekly column where she rants about anything and everything.  Her views are frank, candid and controversial to say the least.  She has an interesting group of girlfriends who keep her grounded in reality.  Victoria loves dating several guys at once; will she settle down with just one? <br /> <br />Gerald is black man on the move up the corporate ladder and cannot get a handle on picking the right woman.  He is the type of man every career-oriented sister is looking to attract.  But he has been hurt one too many times and doesn't know if settling with one woman is for him.  He is considering a move from Houston to Washington D.C. and checks out women via the Internet.  Will his quest to find the love of his life pan out? <br /> <br />The lively and creative banter exchanged between characters mirrors real life conversation.  However, the description of the online chats was difficult for me to follow, as was the use of online slang and unfamiliar abbreviations.  I found myself asking what the heck was that all about?  Hatter used different mirrors at the beginning of the chapter alert the reader as to which character was talking.  This was great because at times I could not distinguish Victoria from Gerald in the relationship sagas.  I was disappointed in the ending because it was not clear as to who got hooked up with Victoria.  This was definitely a newtwist on relationships and romance <br /> <br />Reviewed by Monique for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-02-03

Rosalyn Story writes this tale using a series of flashbacks that conduct a wonderful symphony of music in the detail of her words.  As the secrets begin to unravel, the supporting characters in the book shed light on their involvement in the continuation of the betrayal. <br /> <br />During one of the worst storms of the decade, a nine-year-old boy, L.J. Tillman, drops off a note and a baby, Olivia, to Big Mama's front door.  Big Mama, Glodean, Country, Uncle Joon, and Clo T. share in the parenting of Olivia.  Big Mama believes God delivered Olivia to them as an answer to years of prayer.   Nearly 20 years later, that nine-year-old boy, L.J. Tillman is reintroduced to Olivia.  They fall in love and get married.  L.J. lives the ideal musicians life until he reveals a deep, dark family secret to Olivia. <br /> <br />She banishes him from the house forever not knowing that her wish may come true.  Grief-stricken by his wife's outburst and dismissal from his dream job, L.J. turns to the bottle.  Drinking and wallowing in despair, he plunges off an embankment landing in the river.  He escapes the car and the city that doesn't want him by jumping a train to New York City. <br /> <br />New York City has little to offer a poor black man with a saxophone.He travels from corner to corner and park bench to homeless shelter playing his horn while living on the streets.  One-day Covington, a jazz singer, turns him onto an open club spot.  L.J. slowly starts piecing his life back together as this gig allows him to save a few dollars. <br /> <br />As the story unfolds, you learn that keeping secrets can tear a relationship apart and deepen your resolve to stay true to yourself.As Olivia learns bits and pieces of the truth, her heart opens and she realizes her purpose in life.  But will her purpose and L.J.'s dream meet again? <br /> <br />Every family has at least one dark secret, but it is how you live with that knowledge which makes the difference.  The development of characters, along with the use of flashbacks, will keep you turning the pages of this novel.  The outcome was unexpected, yet heartwarming.  Story has a gift for writing that is refreshing.  It reminds me of the writings of Maya Angelou and Sonia Sanchez. Finally a saga about family that is not street or gang-related but focuses on down home folks.  I'm waiting on the edge of my seat for her next book. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Monique for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-02-03

She was caught up in living a lifestyle of bling-bling, fancy clothes and big ballas.  Ultimately, her fascination with material things blinded her to the reality of the life she was living and caused her untimely death.  Now her brother, Yatta, is back in GRIMEY seeking to avenge her death...and he's starting with her ex-boyfriend  Cam .   <br /> Cam is laying low since Mona's death; the heat is on him and paranoia has set in.  He believes everyone is after him.  His brother, Kenny, can't believe  Cam was so ruthless that he felt taking Mona's life was the price she had to pay for cheating on him.   That, along with other dark secrets about his brother, makes Kenny wonder if he's his brother's next victim.   <br />El'san is sort of an anti-drug vigilante for the `Borough (Kingsborough Projects).  He can't stand the thought of drug dealers poisoning their own people - black people.  His solution is robbing the drug dealers and taking their \\"ready made\\" money.  He even has his girl, Sweetie, in on the heists.  All goes well until Sweetie runs into  Cam .  You see, El'san found out a lot of information about  Cam while doing a stint in Rickers; he also found out some up-close and personal information about Kenny.  El'san is willing to help Yatta even the score with  Cam , but something goes wrong.   <br />I could keep going but you might get lost in translation.  GRIMEY had too many angles some had less significance than others.  Williams made an attempt to get the message of karma being real across but somehow ended up with overkill, rather than a story.  At some points the story became preachy.  Not to mention the editing; it was not good.  The story read well, but it strayed from the synopsis.  Somewhere near the end it's almost like the author thought, \\"What was my point of saying all that?\\" Williams delivered a contrived ending, neatly wrapping and bringing all the missing pieces together.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review Support my effort to Train to End Stroke: [...] Click on Sponsor Participant and type my name, Esther Mays. <br />   <br />	2005-02-02

She thought James Jordan, son of Congressman Felix Jordan, was \\"the one\\" until they broke up. Suddenly, his fear of long-term commitment disappeared and he married someone else. Although Spiegel is now dating Craig, part of her still yearns for James. Plus, Craig simply may not be the one. Needless to say, her biological clock is blaring like an irritating alarm. <br /> <br />To make matters worse, James shows up at her door with news that his sister, Breanna, may have killed her boyfriend. According to Breanna, she was on vacation with Sean having a great time. The two made love on the beach. Afterward, Sean informed her that he could no longer date her and he had to make it work with his fiance, Fay. Breanna was so upset she hopped on the moped they rode to the beach and practically ran him over as she sped off. Bermuda authorities, who found Sean's dead body, allege that Breanna killed him. Of course, the Jordan family wants Spiegel, the best attorney they know, on the case. <br /> <br />Spiegel has always liked Breanna and she is willing to help her. However, the evidence against her new client is stacking up and the clock is ticking as the court date nears. While trying to choose a plausible defense, James seems to show up at every turn, attempting to rekindle their old flame. Spiegel cannot afford to be distracted. Determined to win the case, she goes as far as researching the PMS defense. But will a jury in Bermuda go for \\"PMS made me do it?\\" <br /> <br />While Tick Tock was an engaging mystery, as the saying goes, the thrill was in the chase. The building of the plot and inclusion of romantic suspense were well done, but the final outcome was unfortunately uneventful. The author essentially summed up the mystery in a single sentence without expounding upon the motive and a few questions were left unanswered. Additionally, toward the end, the story switched gears and focused on a sudden accident that made for unnecessary drama.  <br /> <br />All in all Tick Tock is a good debut novel. The author used her legal knowledge to present believable trial preparation and courtroom drama. Readers will feel as though they are \\"working the case\\" alongside Spiegel. You're probably wondering if she ever finds her knight in shining armor or Bermuda shorts. Well, the jury is still out.

Mona Foster is driven and determined to get what she wants, when she wants, by any means necessary.  For now, she's set on getting close to the rap star named Controversy.  While attending one of his concerts, someone else catches her eyes instead.  His name is Camron, Cam for short.  He tells Mona that he's the man for her, not Controversy.  Blinded by his bling-bling and how he portrays himself to be, she gives him a chance just to see what he has to offer.  \\"Money talks and bulls*** walks\\" in Mona's book; it's all about the benjamins and how much of it she can get.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Cam spoils Mona to no end and promises her a life of grandeur.  She is sucked into the lifestyle of fancy cars, endless shopping sprees and an abundant cash flow.  She even moves in with him without knowing much about him, other than the fact that he has money...and lots of it.  Shortly after living with him, his true colors begin to shine like the bling-bling he wears and slowly but surely she begins to find out more and more about her man.  One day she discovers a little too much information and desperately seeks an out.  Will she be able to escape?   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Reading this novel brought to mind a few money related clichs: \\"The love of money is the root of all evil\\"; \\"more money more problems\\"; and \\"all that glitters is not gold.\\"  Williams gives you a birds-eye view of what the love of money can do to a person.  Blinded is an appropriate title.  The novel is short, a quick read and is on point.  I especially loved the epilogue.  For those who are gold-diggers, groupies, money hungry, or whatever the choice word is these days, I highly recommend this for you...or to a friend who fits the description. <br /> <br />Reveiwed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-01-18

Although I don't think a phrase has been coined for this up and coming \\"sub-genre\\", I feel that Love's Game is a primary example.  Three men are coming into their own, although admittedly later than women, and this is a snapshot into their lives.      <br /> <br />Tyrell, Jeff and Terry are lifelong friends. Owners of several nightclubs, these men seem to have their act together.  Except for one thing: their obsessions for women. Terry and Jeff are cousins and up until recently Terry has been instrumental in forming Jeff's negative low opinion of women.  Terry has never thought about limiting himself to one woman.  He has never found it necessary to remain in a monogamous relationship, even though he's been married to Tracy for years.  Jeff has had thoughts of cheating as an acceptable behavior instilled in him, and while taking these \\"lessons\\" to heart, finds he's actually capable of falling in love.  Tyrell decides to cut his extra honies off and commit to his up and coming physician girlfriend and asks her to move in.   This transition between romantic trysts and monogamy is the crux of Love's Game, all three men soon discover.  Can all three men mature to the level where the women in their lives grow to respect and admire them?    <br /> <br />The snapshot into the lives of these three men who struggle with issues quite common among men today gives, I would imagine, a realistic view from the man's point of view.  From a woman's prospective, there doesn't seem to be much women can do to help our men through this growth process; it is truly a rite of passage some men must take.  Although fictional, I can't help but wonder if glamorizing the innate sexuality of a woman negatively impacts this path towards maturity. Love's Game seemed like a realistic journey but I felt like an outsider.  Maybe this book was geared toward the male reading audience more so than me and in the world of writing African American books; this is a departure from the norm.  There were enthralling sports scenes thrown in, I've never read a play by play for a round of spades before. There was even a detailed description of a basketball game. I'm sure the court action would appeal to basketball enthusiasts.  I commend Harold for writing a book I'm sure men will find worth the read.  The next guy who asks me what book he should pick up, I'll pinch hit for Love's Game. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Sharon for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-01-13

During a career fair at the school, LaShondra meets Stelson Brown. He is a prominent engineer and also happens to be white.  Stelson is immediately smitten with her but she's not paying him any attention, until she notices all the white women falling over themselves to get his attention.  As a way to show them she's the treasure he's seeking, she decides to go to an impromptu lunch with Stelson and the rest is history.  What was supposed to be an innocent lunch turns into way more than LaShondra is willing to deal with at this time. She's having issues with race and many of her beliefs that were embedded by her father.  She struggles with accepting the feelings she's beginning to have for Stelson, but he remains patient and continues to witness but she's not trying to hear what he's saying. She is adamant about this being a personal battle that she has to fight and come to terms with in her own time.  Only time will tell what the heart is really feeling.    I simply loved this book.  Stimpson also used bible teachings to drive her point to home plate.  So often we have a preconceived notion of the \\"type\\" of man we are looking for and as a result end up missing out.  He's too short, too tall, too fat, too skinny, too black, or too white.  The real question is who is he on the inside? Judging a person solely by their physical appearance is a blatant disregard for what's truly important - character.  Love sees no color.  Once we learn that, practice it's concept and give everyone the benefit of the doubt, until given reason not too, then and only then will you really find true love or your very own Boaz.

The unofficial case surrounds the murder of his best friend Noah's prominent politician son Ronan, and intricately weaves a myriad and quite extensive list of characters with their own personal struggles.  Although Blades is a return from Lovell's first work, Too Beautiful to Die, this book is a stand-alone novel.      <br /> <br />Blades has become a successful entrepreneur since retirement. He has ownership in a music store and nightclub in his beloved Brooklyn.  He's over the animosity caused over his departure from the force and is comfortably settled with his wife and newly discovered nine-year-old daughter.  Life is going good.  He attends a birthday party for Noah, where his estranged son Ronan decides to make amends with his father.  A moving public display of love and forgiveness is shattered in the split second it takes for a bullet to end Ronan's life.  Naturally Blades can't sit around and do nothing. The cop instinct is too strong plus his loyalty to his friends, and he feels it is his duty to discover who or what is responsible for this heinous crime.  As the reader is drawn further into this tangled web, people close to Blades are intricately woven into the murder.  I wondered how he trusted anyone, but his intuition and uncanny ability to stick with his feelings sees him through.       <br /> <br />I was struck with the similarities of writing style between Glenville Lovell and Walter Mosley.  I can see Blades reaching the status of Easy Rawlins if he continues on this writing level.  Blades is memorable, an active participant in the drama and cognizant of his influence in the lives of those he is surrounded by.  Both writers tend to use a lot of characters to illuminate the plot and build a healthy anticipation level. No ends were left undone, which is remarkable with such a large cast.  Whatever Mr. Lovellis working on in the future will be added to my list of books to read.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Sharon Hudson of Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-01-12

This isn't the end of his vengeance; he is still determined to avenge his parent's death --twenty years later. What Push doesn't know is: someone is watching him; someone saw him murder his sister's boyfriend in cold blood.  That someone is Roy Washington.   Roy is an ex-informant turned loan shark extraordinaire of  Harlem .    Roy  is intrigued by what he sees and now wants to know the man behind the gun.  He wants to proposition Push to do some work for him.  Push wants to become legit and has a real estate venture brewing in his head, but he needs capital to make it come to fruition.  How will he raise the capital is the question.  <br />While reading you may become a tad bit confused in regards to whom the book is really about.  The title says Push but most of the story is about Roy Washington.  You see,   Roy  is also working a deal with the Feds to uncover a campaigning scheme where a local politician's campaign manager is using monies from the \\"Empowerment\\" fund for his own purposes.  Both   Roy  and Push play integral parts but who hires whom?  As the plot unfolds, a lot of unexpected results are the conclusion and someone ultimately has to pay in the end.  <br />Push reads like an \\"already been done\\" type novel that tells about someone's stint in prison and their attempt to walk on the other side of the law after being released.This attempt was - okay.  The grammatical and editorial errors annoyed me.  I have officially dubbed Relentless Aaron the ellipse king simply because...he used them...clearly where other...punctuation...would have better...fit.  This significantly detracted from the story simply because I kept - pausing.  Ain't that many breaths in a story, period.  While the story had potential, it failed on this attempt. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-01-11

She is having a hard time discerning which was worst: the fact that Ronald died or that he was discovered with his mistress.  On September 11th, Lieutenant Colonel Arlene Taft reluctantly reports to work at Walter Reed Hospital as a registered nurse while she figures out what to do with her life.  Her assignment was to care for Lieutenant Colonel Neal Allen who was severely injured in the bombing of the Pentagon.  Allen coincidently happens to be her military brat next-door neighbor from grade school.   Taft tends to his every need, reassures his family during his recovery and develops a friendship with Neal's niece, April. Neal cannot believe Arlene takes the time to talk with April during his long-term stay at the hospital.  Under the circumstances he thought she would be acting as a woman scorned. <br /> <br />Fast-forward eighteen months, Taft and Allen meet again in Germany. Quickly they rekindle a romantic relationship.  Neal decides to disclose what he knows about Ronald and risk losing Arlene forever. Now Arlene must face the demons of her past in order to find love. Will Arlene, Neal and April come together as a family? <br /> <br />There are too many sub-plots in this romance to make it a good read.  Arlene is a woman that has been burnt in love once and is scared to trust again.  Neal is dealing with the death of his sister while raising her daughter as a single man.  April is an adolescent dealing with life never knowing her father's love.  Then there are issues with the family - Ronald's mother is dying from grief and the Allen family can't get over the deception of their daughter's lover.  The only part of this romance that deals with the military is the setting.  Poarch could have dealt more with the trials of military service after 9/11.  This was another predictable romance novel.  If you plan on reading this one, get ready for a sleeper. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Monique Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-01-06

It's nothing more than a state of mind...\\"  DeMarques is the youngest male in the Prince family and has been given the name Prince, like his last name. He hopes to follow in his uncle Silk's and brother Ant's footsteps and become a Big Balla.  Ant is not thrilled about Prince getting caught up in the drug game and tries to keep him out of it, by any means necessary.  Prince is hardheaded and determined to make his own mistakes in spite of the warnings. <br /> <br />The story begins with Prince giving an interview after being exonerated, fifteen years later, for a crime he didn't commit.  The introduction is saturated with lyrics, from various songs, and put together to tell his story.  The concept is annoying.  Somewhere mid-point, the protagonist becomes an intellect and tells his story - beginning with his childhood, becoming a teenage father, losing his two best friends, events leading to his prison sentence and the difficulty of serving the actual sentence.  Although his alibis were airtight, he was still convicted.  He believes he was hoodwinked by his lawyer.  The sentence: the rest of his natural life is the judge's ruling. Prince knows who committed the murder, or at least he thinks he knows, and never says a word.  Instead he hopes an appeal will eventually set him free. <br />During his incarceration he has to endure hearing about the death of various family members.  The one that hurts the most is the death of his brother, Ant.  Once Prince is released, he is determined to avenge his brother's death without getting caught and risk having to be sent back to his version of hell - prison.  In a plot to maintain and remain true to family, HOOD RICH kept my eyebrow in the raised position.  My mouth literally fell open when I read some of the pages, making me say, \\"What?\\" I simply love and can never get enough of plot twisters. <br />Perkins-Stell says this book waswritten in only forty-five days.  Unbelievable.  The execution and presentation was comparable to some of the works I've readwhich were said to have taken years to write.  Take notes, because HOOD RICH is definitely a good read. I'll be sure to ask a friend, who happens to be incarcerated, if Gladiator school really exists. According to Prince, Gladiator school is where you either \\"buck, f*** or lock up.\\"  It's all about maintaining your manhood and being prepared to repeat the process each time you're transferred to a new facility.  That's loyalty, that's deep. No amount of money or loyalty could make me stay true like Prince did; I would sing like the fat lady...and then it'd be over. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-01-05

The stories deal with our history, family, the power of praise and worship, lessons learned over time, triumph over controversies, accepting who you are and making a difference in the world.  The stories will leave you feeling loved and filled with confidence about being African-American. <br /> <br />Everyone needs to read a warm, loving and inspiring story every now and then.  All of the stories are uplifting, but there were a few that especially tugged at my heartstrings.  \\"I Owe You an Apology\\" pays tribute to our African-American men by honoring their greatness instead of constantly complaining about their shortcomings.   \\"Where's Your Notebook?\\" describes one father's weekly lessons to his sons, each family should be so involved.  \\"The Lady at the Bus Stop\\" acknowledges the privilege of education while recognizing that someone else paved the way before her. <br /> <br />I plan on purchasing this book for all of my friends and family, as it is one to be shared.

The book is a must-have for families following the teachings of Christ in today's fast-paced world.  The Powells offer a fresh outlook, which is rich in heritage and truly anointed in the word of God. Their biblically sound examples and practical applications make it easy to transform your personal relationship with God while expressing love and sharing the word with your family. <br /> <br />The authors begin the book focusing on a personal relationship with God.  Using biblical principles, the book emphasizes how every aspect of your life is tied to the Bible, even soul food Sunday dinners.  The discussion on intimacy in marriages describes personal stories of commitment and provides suggestions on how to keep marriage as a threefold cord.  The words are carefully crafted into stories, which present a clear relationship between Christ, husband and wife.  Examples on how to enrich your marriage through romantic interludes, husbands leading the family while modeling the principles of Christ, wives modeling submission but still being independent, disciples expressing and sharing God's love to our families. <br />Is it possible for today's African-American family to raise children to be Christ-like?  The Powells say YES!  They present examples, affirmations, and suggestions on changing from \\"world view\\" to \\"biblical view\\" without compromising commitments to self, family, church or work.  They chip away at America's problem, the breakdown of the family, in a way that will transform the world. <br /> <br />Soul Food & Living Water is not just a guidebook for reinventing the African-American family; it provides real-life answers to some of today's most complicated questions.  As a Sunday school teacher and avid reader of Christian books on family and marriage, I strongly recommend this book to families, book clubs, Sunday school classes, and church leaders, as it will promote discussion while providing a biblicalfoundation.  The word selection and presentation of ideas are skillfully sewn together to be culturally sensitive and relevant  to other cultures.  If family is important to you, this book should be part of your library.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Monique Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review	2005-01-04

I'm sure it's not nearly as much as a woman does, especially if she is over the age of thirty and her biological clock no longer sounds like a tick - but an alarm.  Maxine is business savvy but man stupid; she sleeps with men without knowing more than their names.  Her physical needs take precedent over her emotional needs.  Indira is in an abusive marriage with a man she loves dearly.  She wanted to one day have children but can't, at least not with her husband since he had a vasectomy before they married.  Sydney, on the other hand, is a single-mother still pining for the father of her child.  She lives with the hope that one day he'll return to her and their daughter. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />It's been said that past experiences dictate your future.  In some cases that's true if you allow the vicious cycle to continue.  Maxine is dealing with abandonment issues; her mother left her with her grandmother at a very young age, never to return.  During a Thanksgiving dinner, Maxine's aunt reveals some shocking information about her mother and now Maxine must make a decision.  Sydney's mother has never forgiven her for becoming pregnant by her thuggish boyfriend, Anthony.  They have not spoken in almost two years even though they attend the same church and only sit two pews behind each other.  A change is going to come and the person who brings it about is not whom you'd expect.  Indira is steadily trying to hide her husband's abuse from her friends.  Just when she's had enough, her husband decides to leave her and file for divorce.  Indira is angered by the news and even more shocked when information she never knew about her husband is suddenly revealed.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />There's a saying: Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  She'll Learn is about the lessons you learn (or don't learn) from life's experiences.  I've always said there's a person who always \\"takes you there.\\"  By that I mean there's a person who always manages to make you weak enough to let your defenses down.  And even though you get hurt in the process, somehow you just can't let go; therefore causing you to do stupid things in the name of love (or even lust).  You become vulnerable and before you know it, you're caught up in trying to prove something either to yourself or the person who has hurt you.  Maxine, Indira and Sydney each are in this predicament and their friendship sustains them. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />To know someone has got your back, no matter what, makes all the difference in the world.  These women had their differences but they didn't let that stop them from being friends, even when times got rough.  I've always known a person will keep doing what you allow them to do; She'll Learn drove the lesson home. I even saw myself in one of the characters; however, I won't reveal which one.  The story flowed well and didn't skip a beat.  Barkley - Staples did well with this one and only teased me by insinuating there would be a sequel.

In Garrard McClendon's educational, but humorous book, Ax or Ask? The African American Guide to Better English, I found myself howling with laughter at times.  Yet, in hindsight, I'm sure that wasn't the proper reaction.  It's a fact, the current generation speak in a strange combination of English, slang, and street terms <br /> <br />Not only did Mr. McClendon provide statistics and suggestions on how teachers could help their students, he also provides a glossary of forbidden words, definitions, phrases, and pronunctiations.  Though it isn't funny, but quite the opposite, I could picture a comedian using some of the lines in this book, such as \\"Drowned - drowned is not pronounced with the extra \\"did\\" on the end:  drowned (drown'd), not drown-did.\\"  Other misused words are noted as well as grammatical problems such as subject/verb agreement and double negatives. <br /> <br />I'm glad to know this book is being taught in different school systems and commend Mr. McClendon for his efforts on educating African-Americans on the need to improve their literary skills, to include: reading, writing, and speaking.  With our kids' test scores and the lack of committed teachers, a book of this nature could very well bridge the gap between speaking right versus speaking wrong, arming them for better educations, jobs, and lifestyles.

If they do, a lot of times they are only temporary, not \\"happily ever after.\\"  In this 200+ page book, Liz shares the most intimate details of her life, with the focus on her once loving relationship with her husband Keith and their marriage.  She's deeply in love with him and imagines nothing but a lifetime of love and happiness.  Things start getting a little shaky when she suspects him of cheating.  After lying repeatedly, Keith finally comes clean, so Liz is left to pick up the pieces of her marriage.  When she finds out he had a son as a result of the affair, she almost loses it. <br /> <br />The title, From Fairy Tale to Forgiveness: One Woman's Journey, alludes to the sharing of a journey of the author's experience in her marriage before and after her husband's betrayal.  However, I didn't quite get what I expected out of the book.  I understand no one wants to be betrayed and once the act is done, it takes a while to get through the pain in order to start working on the healing process.  Ms. Williams spent too much time belaboring the fact that she was cheated on, questioning her husband, asking things probably better left unknown.  At times, I felt as if she was actually torturing herself with the questions.  It isn't until the last few pages that she actually gets to the forgiveness stage.  As a result, this book missed it's mark for me. <br /> <br />Additionally, too much time was spent on family relations and things that really had no impact on her marriage.  Some of these things were repetitive throughout the book.  Lastly, the editing in this book appeared non-existent.  It would've been a better read had more attention been paid to structural, typographical, and grammatical errors.  In spite of these things, the author's message is clear: with strength and courage, you can get through all things, even betrayal of a spouse. <br /> <br/>Reviewed by Mz.

Stew is not keen on the idea of capitalizing off the death of one of his girls; however, it's still business as usual.  That is until more tragedy strikes in his other locations: Seattle and the Bronx .  Six more girls die and the tragedies cause him to lose money and girls.

None of the issues significantly detracted me from the story but did make me cringe whenever I noticed them.  The cover is a little gaudy with its advertising; it advertised the book, a publishing company, a clothing line and the name Relentless.  Talk about shameless plugs.

Beverly Rolyat has pulled the covers back on one family by showing that the sexual sins of the patriarch has a trickle down affect on the lives of others. <br /> <br />The book opens with the accounts of Big Blue.  He is the husband of the pastor's daughter and he suffers from a sexual addiction.  Big Blue's sickness leads to deviant activities and eventually his death.  He leaves behind five children, three from his wife and two from his prostitute lover.  He passes his lustful spirit to his offspring. <br /> <br /> The main character in the book is Nick Allapaplus, a white district attorney who develops a taste for African American women after divorcing his fourth wife.  His fifth wife, Teresa is a sister who is a \\"closet\\" or shall I say \\"basement\\" alcoholic.  They take in Elee, Nick's stepdaughter from a previous marriage.  Her presence in their life wrecks havoc.  His life is deeply intertwined with the descendants of Big Blue. <br /> <br />We also meet Big Blue's children: Vivian, Luther and Paula.  These are the children he conceived with his wife.  Vivian is a prostitute and Luther is homosexual.  Paula seems to be the only child untouched by her father's curse of sexual perversion.  Big Blue's twins, Lil' Gurl and Ba' Bruh, from his extra-marital affair with the prostitute, play a crucial role in all of the family drama.  It is interesting to see how the lives of all of these characters play a role in Nick's life in the most unusual and explosive ways. <br /> <br />I almost missed the message the author was trying to convey because of the strong sexual content of the book.  I had to step back and realize that she was keeping it real by telling the true nature of people.

Carmen is a native of New York and Jewell and Regina are both transplants from California and New Jersey , respectively.  They have their initial encounter to becoming friends while being stuck in an elevator.  Each is from a different world.  Jewell is an ex-child star seeking a \\"normal\\" life; Regina is a spoiled upper middle-class brat; and Carmen is just trying to survive.  <br /> <br />Their friendship blossoms in 5D, the apartment they share as roommates. Regina decides being in the limelight is more important than a college education.  She walks on the wild side and puts her ideas into full swing by creating Good Tyme Productions, a company that hosts the best parties around.  Jewell is tired of her mother's tight hold on her life and career.  As a result, she fires her as her manager, branches off and explores what else life has to offer.  Carmen is rigid and her only focus is to succeed. She doesn't have time for anyone or anything but her studies and her desire to become a doctor.  That is, until the advice of a good friend, Milton, makes her see things differently.  <br /> <br />The friends grow from young adults to women and learn the value of true friendship and the bond created by it.  They have their secrets and are hesitant in sharing them. All three women expose themselves once they feel revealing their secret will help the other friend through her personal storm.  <br /> <br />Better Than I Know Myself drives the lesson home of how a person will only tell you what they want you to know.  Just when you think you know a person, you are told something you would have never fathomed to be true.  That's not a bad thing unless you give the information to the wrong person.  Jewell, Carmen and Regina have a friendship that stands the test of time, drug abuse, sickness and health.<br /> <br />DeBerry and Grant have written the best tearjerker of the decade.  I thought Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made was the best book I'd ever read until they wowed me with yet another bestseller.  These women have a knack for writing novels and when I grow up I want to be just like them - bestselling author(s).  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays of Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-11-23

Sisterhood of Shopaholics tells the stories of four friends who happen to have the same problems: they are addicted to shopping and their reasoning is because of men, or lack thereof. Break out the glitter and sprinkle it over these ladies because the fairy godmother has arrived to make all their woes go away, with the snap of a finger.  <br /> <br />Della Mitchell has an addiction to lingerie and lots of it. It's nothing for her to spend $300 on a nightgown with a matching robe. \\"Shameless.\\" She's dealing with the insecurity and shopping addiction her divorce has left her with. She made a promise to give up shopping to get her life back in order and to take care of what's really important - her daughter. As a reward to her overcoming her addiction, she treats herself to Victoria's Secrets and finds more than lingerie. She meets handsome pilot, J. Byron Fulton.  <br /> <br />Denise \\"Neecy\\" Ballard likes to shop period. On one of her many shopping sprees, she happens to look out the window and find her car being repossessed. She not only ends up with a hat she didn't really want, but also the man who's repossessing her car. Joseph Vaughn. \\"Please, Baby, Please\\" let her find a good man who will treat her right and appreciate her for the woman she is.  <br /> <br />Ramona has a shoe fetish and loves expensive suits. But she can afford it. Nailz and Detailz, her salon, has been very profitable. However, she never mixes business with pleasure and will never jeopardize her business for a shopping spree, but a little splurging never hurt anyone. That's until she runs into her ex-lover, Kadeem Smith while out conquering her fear of going to Phipps Plaza, an ultra chic shopping center in Atlanta, and not being inclined to buy something. After their chance meeting she realizes \\"It Takes Two\\" to admit their mistakes and to talk about what ultimately broke them up.  <br /> <br />Gillian has the tendency to pacify herself with nice things by way of shopping sprees. She does thisto make up for not having a man. But when her Nana is on her dying bed, Gillian concocts some ridiculous scheme to pretend she's engaged to be married in hopes it'll throw Nana into a speedy recovery. Looking for the perfect dress leads to a catfight and ultimately she's left staring in the ebony eyes of mall director Rick Parker. Sometimes making \\"Promises\\" you can't keep will put you in hot water. Gillian has new dilemmas now.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a solution to your shopping addiction, Sisterhood of Shopaholics is not the remedy. Instead, it deals more with what caused these women to become shopaholics; it's more like a holistic approach. Once you admit you have a problem, then you're on your way to finding a solution. These women did that and now they're well on their way to happiness and freedom. The authors, Esdaile et. al are talented writers; however the title, Sisterhood of Shopaholics, is a cover up for what's really a romance novel. I loved the ending of each story, although I felt I was left hanging. I wanted to know more.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays of Loose Leaves Book Review <br />	2004-11-23

How do two African-Americans, who are uncomfortable in the skin they are born in, forge a successful union in the early 1900s if the relationship is doomed from the beginning?  Eleanor Alexander depicts the courtship and marriage of Paul Laurence Dunbar and Alice Ruth Moore, African-American pioneers in the literary arena. <br /> <br /> Paul Dunbar is born in Dayton, Ohio on June 27, 1872 to a doting mother and an abusive father.  A sickly child, Paul has an unusually close relationship with his mother, Matilda.  He writes his first poem about a problematic marriage at the age of eleven probably based on his parent's relationship.  Paul hits it big on the literary scene with tales of plantation Negroes who speak with broken English and are a source of amusement to his white audience. He grows to loathe the tales as his more serious work goes unnoticed. <br /> <br />Alice Moore is the illegitimate daughter of a woman who washes clothes for a living.  Her mother educates her and her sister. Their mother seeks the best for them and they grow into cultured young ladies.  Alice and her sister are able to pass for white.  This causes her not to identify herself as being Negro. Alice's stories often centers on female characters who are referred to as Mulatto or Creole but never Negro. <br /> <br />Both Paul and Alice hate their African-American heritage.  Paul falls in love with Alice when he sees a picture of her in a magazine.  He prefers to date light-skinned or Mulatto woman.  Although Alice detest Paul's dark skin but she is drawn to his fame in the literary world and what his fame could potentially do for her writing career. <br /> <br />They keep their courtship private, communicating through letters. Paul suffers from mental issues and alcoholism.  He also holds sexist views, handed down from his father, causing him to be abusive.These factors, added with the extra \\"burden\\" of being Negro during this time period, adds to the destruction of their marriage. <br /> <br />Eleanor Alexander recounts an excellent part of history regarding the marriage relationship of a prominent African-American couple.  The book is repetitious at times but she gave very extensive information regarding the thoughts and feelings on racism, sexism and class status.  This was a fascinating yet tragic love story. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Paula Henderson of Loose Leaves Book Review.	2004-11-23

With this latest literary contribution, Mason once again paints vivid character portraits that are magnetic in nature, drawing readers in and conjuring up strong emotions long after the final page is turned.  <br /> <br />This compelling tale presents two generations of women who experience severe, one-sided love-a love that starts as an innocent crush, turns to teenage infatuation and leads to undying obsession and ultimately ends with a shattered heart.  <br /> <br />As a child, Roberta watches her mother, Eula May, become completely obsessed with Bobby Lewis, a married man. But when Bobby is found dead in Eula May's home and she is later discovered shot to death, rumors begin to fly about the adulterous love affair and Eula's suicide.  <br /> <br />After her mother's death, Roberta is taken in by Martha, the town's midwife. While not a very loving home, Martha provides Roberta with the basics: food, clothes and shelter. Like many adolescent teenagers, Roberta falls in love, but it's more like an obsessive attraction to Charles, a young man who is off limits. Not only is he older and a known ladies' man, but he also has his eyes set on Nadine Cooper. Determined to get her man, Roberta devises evil plans and ultimately gets the object of her desire, Charles. One night of passion with Charles results in a pregnancy and forced marriage. Struggling to be a mother to her two kids, Roberta's only comfort is that she is married to the love her life. But does he love her? Will he ever return the feelings she has for him? The probability is doubtful.  <br /> <br />JD Mason has truly made her mark in the fiction world. She has mastered the essence of characterization. With multi-dimensional, precisely drawn characters, she has again succeeded in writing an unforgettable tale. While reading, I was thrown off when the story jumped and new characters were introduced. Also, at times the story seemed to pace along slowly, but once the momentum was built, a love triangle became a deadly web of deceit and made for very engaging reading.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Joan Burke Stanford for Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-11-17

We all wish for and constantly strive to become closer to God. Dane Cunningham's very insightful book will help us to determine those things that may hinder us from being all that we can be spiritually. He invites us to take spiritual inventory of the relationships in our lives. He uses the story of Samson as a analogy.  <br /> <br />The author challenges us to take a look at our inner man -- our personality, character and temperament. We should then be able to identify where our strengths and weaknesses lie. We are then asked to take a look at our soul, which is comprised of our will, intellect, emotions, memory and imagination. Our soul has needs that have to be met in order for us to be fulfilled. Through prayer we are able to understand the needs of our soul and God is the one who can help us to identify how to meet those needs. The author also mentions we have soul ties, which are connections we make to other sources through the components of our soul in order to fulfill our need for relationships. Some of the soul ties we have in our lives  <br />are ungodly. These should be identified and removed because they can cause damage to our relationship with God.  <br /> <br />Cunningham walks us through this self-examination showing us the issues of our heart and our sin nature. All the while he is using the life of Samson to help the reader identify areas in their life where they may not measure up to what God would have us be. I would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking a closer walk with God. I gained a lot of knowledge about myself just by taking a look within.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Paula Henderson for Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-11-03

The families establish a home for themselves in Eden; it is a blessed and prosperous place where living is easy and the people are happy. As the blessings overflow in Eden, the townspeople begin to take them for granted. They become unthankful and unappreciative of all they possess.  <br /> <br />The first Eliza, the matriarch of a long line of women named Eliza, possesses the power of magic which is passed down to each first born daughter, who are also aptly named Eliza. Eliza tries everything within her power to ward off the ungrateful behavior of the people of Eden. She even administers salves and herbal teas in hopes to get it out of their system. However, nothing seems to work because she has ignored the problem too long. She recognizes punishment is inevitable for Eden. The punishment comes in the form of a deadly massacre that leaves Eden cursed.  <br /> <br />Decades later, Aspasia, the great-granddaughter of the first Eliza, and two of her childhood friends, Hawk-eye and Jeremiah, stumble upon the secret hidden in the heart of Eden. After the gruesome discovery, the three friends part, never to speak about their discovery. The horror follows them throughout their adult life and manifests itself in their behavior. Aspasia is restless and constantly searching for satisfaction. Hawk-eye is haunted by the spirit world. He is able to predict the death of others and can see that his own is fast approaching. Jeremiah runs away to New York and seeks peace in the love of many women. He eventually returns to Eden. His irresponsible behavior leads to his slow demise, which redeems Eden of its past sins.  <br /> <br />Shawne Johnson simply amazes me with her style of writing. This is her second novel and she truly astounds her readers with her prose. She draws you totally into the book: the tastes, the smell and the feel of the surroundings. The pictures she paints are vivid in the reader's mind. Emotions drip from the characters. I would have liked more of a story line involving Aspasia, Hawk-eye and Jeremiah getting to know them better. Nonetheless, it is a great book and a story that should be savored.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Paula Henderson of Loose Leaves Book Review <br />	2004-11-03

Some habits are hard to break, as he will soon discover.  <br /> <br />Being out of the ministry for awhile after his disgraceful removal from Faith Missionary Baptist Church, Curtis feels the call from God to return. He receives an offer to pastor Truth Missionary Baptist Church, which consists of some of the former members, who did not believe the rumors that got him ousted from Faith. There is one condition to his new appointment. He must find a wife within a year. He chooses Mariah as his new wife; a sweet young lady he is dating whom deals with a few self-esteem issues and comes from a shameful background. She makes the perfect wife because she knows her place and knows nothing about his past transgressions.  <br /> <br />Curtis has developed a friendship with several prominent pastors who \\"school\\" him on how to manipulate the church to get what he wants to satisfy his lust for money. Curtis introduces these ideas to the deacons of the church, but is met with opposition. His pastor friends give him insight on how to deal with the opposition. Curtis is also consumed with the lust of the flesh. Mariah is the \\"perfect\\" wife in all areas but the bedroom. This causes him to reconnect with his former lovers Adrienne and Charlotte, the mother of his son. With the time it takes to run his church and romance two women outside of his wife, Curtis' relationship with Mariah and his daughter, Alicia begin to suffer.  <br /> <br />Alicia resents her father's relationship with his new wife. Her presence in his life means there is not a chance for her parents to reconcile and he does not have enough time to spend with her. She starts to act out rebelliously at home and at school. She finds support from her online friend, an older guy who she deceives into thinking she is older than she actually is. After Curtis breaks his promiseto Alicia, she agrees to meet her friend in person. The encounter occurs with traumatic results.

Her suspicions are verified when she starts doing some investigating. She pulls her best friend in to help her figure out how to get out of her miserable marriage. The plan takes a different turn than they had anticipated and the results are truly explosive.  <br /> <br />Kimberla Roby has done it again. She has taken a real-life situation seldom talked about and has brought it before her readers for discussion. The follow up to CASTING THE FIRST STONE was pretty interesting. However, I would have liked to see more of what happens in the lives  <br />of the characters after the explosive climax.

Down low is not difficult to say or spell, in a generic sense. Abbreviated DL, down low is a term used by \\"straight men\\" that have sexual relationships with both men and women but do not associate themselves with the homosexual community. They are just men. The result of this behavior has not only caused women to become distrustful of men but has also caused many unsuspecting women to become HIV positive. J.L. King gives a sobering, first-hand look at a reality that has plagued the Black community for so long. He is bold enough to step forward and give us this reality check in non-fiction form.  <br /> <br />J.L. King, a former DL brother, gives us a candid look at the DL lifestyle. He started a website soliciting stories (and used some of his own) to demonstrate the reckless behavior of these men, their style, look and reasoning. The story that touched me the most is the one of Nigel. He is a high school student aspiring to go to college and has a girlfriend he wants to marry. He feels his good looks will take him many places. He also has a mentor who happens to be a DL brother. After Nigel tells him about the promise of a modeling career, the mentor wants to educate him about the DL lifestyle but doesn't know how to do it. He fears Nigel will eventually be \\"turned out\\" if he's not careful. The scenario is risky especially since his mentor doesn't want him to feel as though he is coming on to him in any way. Does the mentor ever have that \\"talk\\" with Nigel?  <br /> <br />A plethora of questions begin to invade your mind as you read. What does a DL man look like? He could be any brother you encounter on a day-to-day basis. Your neighbor, your co-worker or your minister...yeah, I said your minister! His \\"look\\" isn't limited to the stereotypical \\"limp wrist, flamboyant\\" type brother. He could even be the man you sleep with every night. How do you detect a DL brother? If the method of detecting a DL brother were that obvious then it would make use of the term null andvoid. The whole point is to remain incognito, by any means necessary.  <br /> <br />On The Down Low, addresses many subjects using DL lingo and terms, but not enough pages are used; the book is not big enough. I was saddened by many of the stories and yet I still craved more information. Like J.L. says, \\"This issue is not going away anytime soon.\\" This is not the beginning and definitely will not be the end especially with the alarming HIV/AIDS rate in the Black community. Why are so many heterosexual Black women in monogamous relationships contracting HIV/AIDS? On The Down Low gives statistics and facts about this epidemic. J.L. recommends that DL brothers come forward, be honest about who they are and stop their destructive behavior with their unsuspecting victims. He advises women not to be afraid to ask lots of questions, while being careful not to alienate a good brother. Last but not least, do not be afraid to demand HIV/STD results before starting a sexual relationship. I recommend this book for everyone: men, women and teenagers.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays of Loose Leaves Book Review <br />	2004-11-03

It was not because the book talked about chicken a lot, but the title alone had me yearning. Ms. Files introduces the reader to variations of the word \\"chicken.\\" It can be a coward, a chickenhead (slang for women who are golddiggers), or the bird that produces meat or eggs. How do you like your chicken?  <br /> <br />The readers were first introduced to Reesy and Misty in Scenes From A Sistah and later in Getting to the Good Part. Now they're back again and the opening scene is at Reesy's wedding. Only she doesn't get married and the story takes off from there. It seems her fianc Dandre has a hidden past and the skeletons fall out the closet at the most inopportune time...their wedding day. Now he has to prove his love to take-no-prisoners Reesy. She's not putting up with any bull, so she hightails herself far away from her problems in classic Reesy and Misty fashion. She even packs some fried chicken and white bread for the trip.  <br /> <br />Misty has her own issues to deal with. She finds out her husband Rick has been less than honest with her. He makes a life altering decision without her consent. Although devastated, she realizes, \\"you can run but you can't hide.\\" She decides to stop running and to start fighting for what she loves and believes in and tries to work it out. She tries to share this revelation with Reesy who is too stubborn to understand.  <br /> <br />Get a plastic bag (or paper bag), batter the chicken, fry it, season it and add some sauce; spicy sauce for the chicken wings and spicy drama to the story. Tyrene and Tyrone, Reesy's parents, are an added subplot. I can't forget Hill, Dandre's father, who serves as a hot number himself. If you've ever heard, \\"save the drama for your mama,\\" this subplot gives a whole new meaning to the saying.  <br /> <br />Tastes Like Chicken is hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing and craving chicken. While reading, I called a friend and asked if she had read it.She said no. I recommended it by saying, \\"That chile sho' can tell a story.

Gloria Mallette's The Honey Well, depicts the twisted mother-daugher bonds between Arnell and her mother, Esther. Esther entices her sixteen year-old daughter, Arnell, to prostitute herself to their landlord to pay the rent which is several months behind. This is the start of Queen Esther's lucrative career as the madam of the Honey Well, prostituting Arnell to her benefit. After establishing her business and hiring additional young ladies to meet the growing clientele, Esther promises Arnell that she can quit working at the Honey Well when she graduates college. Esther reneges on her promise to free Arnell from her duties as a prostitute even after she completes college. Years later, Esther is still calling and Arnell is still responding to the call to perform just one more \\"favor\\". The situation becomes sticky when Esther has ammunition to blackmail Arnell with to keep her in her clutches.  <br /> <br />Arnell's character is truly perplexing. She clearly hates the lifestyle she has been pulled into and has a strong dislike for Esther, yet she stays and seemingly fails to fight back against her mother. Perhaps it is her deep longing for her mother's love and a desire for a normal relationship that keeps Arnell from totally escaping. Arnell knows her engagement to James Stanton, a politician and the son of one of the most prominent pastors in the area, is the stronghold that Esther has over her. She also realizes that revealing the truth about her past to James will eventually break the bond Esther has.  <br /> <br />Esther's character is a complex ball of loneliness, envy, greed and perversion. How can a mother ask her daughter to perform such acts? Secrets from her past defines the person Esther came to be. She will stop at nothing to get what she wants - mainly money- without regard for how her decisions affect the lives of others. As cold-hearted as Esther is with Arnell, we see a sensitive and hurt sideto her when she eventually loses the one person she may have truly cared about. When a blast from her past comes back threatening to reveal her secrets, the drama really jumps off at The Honey Well.  <br /> <br />Gloria Mallette is truly a talented and skillful writer. She captivates the reader from the very first page and does not let go until the very end. I have enjoyed past novels by Mallette and she has never failed to shock as well as entertain her readers. I am sitting on the edge of my seat, awaiting her next novel. The rate she is going, she won't let her fans down.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Paula Henderson for Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-11-03

But author Kayla Perrin took me in a totally different direction with this brilliantly written novel of murder, suspense and betrayal. Sylvia Grayson is the matriarch of an affluent African-American family in New Orleans. Her family heritage includes being the daughter of one of the original founders of Delta Gamma Psi sorority. The women of this family carry down the traditions of attending Dillard University and pledging Delta.  <br /> <br />Being of an elite heritage, Sylvia marries a jazz musician, whom is considered beneath her by her family standards. From the union, a daughter named Olivia is conceived. It is expected of her to follow in the footsteps of her mother and grandmother and attend Dillard and pledge Delta.  <br /> <br />During the summer of 1975, when a stranger moves to town and a young girl is murdered, the nature of Sylvia and Olivia's relationship is changed forever. An incident from Sylvia's past comes back to haunt her. She believes that the young man she has hired to do some work around the estate knows what she would prefer to keep hidden. She pays the young man to leave town. This totally devastates Olivia, who has developed a relationship with him.  <br /> <br />Olivia grows up to be the author of horror stories. She is an embarrassment to her mother because of her drinking and the erotic nature of her fiction. Although a Delta member, Sylvia barely acknowledges her presence and overlooks her for committees. Olivia realizes her mother still considers her a disappointment. She fails to recognize the relationship with Rachelle is failing miserably. Rachelle develops a rebellious streak after her best friend; Alette tells her she overheard Olivia admitting she deceitfully altered the path of Rachelle's future. Rachelle goes against her upbringing, even contemplating not following thetradition of becoming a Delta.  <br /> <br />A person from Olivia's past reenters her life around the same time Sylvia is receiving threats and accusations concerning the murder of a young girl in 1975. Through a series of events, secrets are revealed that hurt and change the way Olivia sees her mother. It all culminates with dead bodies, explosive revelations of \\"who done it\\" and eventually, restored relationships.  <br /> <br />Kayla Perrin did an outstanding job keeping me guessing and flipping pages. I thought the drama would never end. Just when you think you have it figured out, there's another plot twist.

Tangy Mae is the darkest child of Rozelle Quinn. Rozelle is the matriarch of the infamous Quinn clan of Pakersfield, Georgia, which consists of ten children who possess differing shades of melanin, shows evidence of the varying paternity of each child.  <br /> <br />Rozelle, not a religious person, uses the biblical phrase \\"Honor thy mother\\" to keep her children loyal and obedient, all while extracting unspeakable and horrific acts of abuse on them. Her compulsion to hold on to her children and her twisted mental state is the catalyst that keeps the story moving.  <br /> <br />Set in the late 1950s, the story is told through the eyes of thirteen-year-old Tangy Mae. Tangy's desire is to graduate from high school and attend college. Rozelle tries all that she can to thwart Tangy's efforts and kill her dreams labeling her the \\"ugliest\\" of her children. Tangy endures the abuse from her mother in order to protect her siblings and continue with her dream.  <br /> <br />The drama the family experiences is loaded with murder, betrayal and sexual abuse. Rozelle never fails to shock the reader with each selfish act. When you think that she can get no worse, she does something more to knock you off your feet.  <br /> <br />The author poignantly details the pain the children experience at the hands of the one who should show them unconditional love. Although it is a dark story there are moments of happiness, hope and love.  <br /> <br />Delores Phillips has done an excellent job with her first work of fiction, portraying each character vibrantly through the book. The plot twists are enough to keep readers talking for a long time.

The Salt Roads is the third novel by science fiction writer, Nalo Hopkinson; however, this novel is really more of a historical fantasy. Hopkinson combines elements of voodoo, mythology and Christianity to weave a very interesting story that shares a common symbolic thread -- salt -- the salt in tears, in sweat, in blood and even in the sea.  <br /> <br />With the unfortunate burial of a stillborn infant, the goddess Ezili is evoked from the prayers of three Caribbean slave women to their individual gods. Ezili is the goddess of sex and love. She possesses the ability to occupy the minds and bodies of three different women during various periods of time. With her birth and inhabitation of these women, Ezili offers the strength to love and hope for a better life.  <br /> <br />In eighteenth century Saint Dominique, Mer, a Caribbean slave women, has the gift of healing. She is content with her life as a slave and spending time with her female lover until she receives a visit from the spirit Lasiren, who gives her a message to save the slaves on the plantation. Ezili gives her the strength she needs to take on the responsibility. She faces several challenges with a sorceror named Makandal who is starting a slave revolt on the plantation. Her relationship with her lover is threatened when her lover's husband returns to the plantation with an invitation for Tipingee to leave with him.  <br /> <br />In nineteenth century Paris, Jeanne Duval, a dancer and the lover of poet Charles Baudelaire, is seeking true love and security. Because she is of African descent, she can never be more than Charles' mistress because he is too cowardly to stand up to his overbearing mother who controls all of his money. Theirs is a twisted love affair that leaves Jeanne unsatisfied. Jeanne is the first body that the spirit Ezili possesses. In Jeanne, Ezili learns and grows. When Jeanne is inattentive or asleep that Ezili is free to travel through space and time. The spirit of Ezili gives Jeanne the strength to find true love even after falling victim to a devastating illness.  <br /> <br />In fourth century Alexandria, Meritet is a nubian prostitute. Meritet is inspired by the tales of Jerusalem and decides to travel there. She takes along her friend Judah, a male prostitute, and they use their bodies as payment for their fare to Jerusalem. Once they arrive in Jerusalem, Judah seems to prosper while Meritet is faced with misfortune. After the spirit of Ezili possess her, Meritet is changed from a prostitute to a saint, a founder of a religion.  <br /> <br />The Salt Roads is a very good book. It is not a quick read and does not follow a logical storyline; it's fantasy, so the elements would not make sense to a logical thinker. The book can also be pretty graphic and extremely gross at some points. Overall, it was an excellent read. I applaud Nalo Hopkinson on this effort.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Paula Henderson of Loose Leaves Book Review <br />	2004-11-03

These are some of the statements that women make concerning men. But after reading 6 Days in January, I will say there are some good men out there especially if they are anything like William McCall. The story begins with William meeting his girlfriend, Della, for dinner to discuss their relationship. Once they get past a small indiscretion, all seems to be going well until they get back to Della's apartment. During their love making, William commits an even bigger indiscretion and Della kicks him out of her apartment and out of her life. This begins the soul-searching exercise that William takes himself through over a course of 6 days in the month of January.  <br /> <br />All of his life, William has been labeled as weak, soft and even gay. He was publicly dissed by his first girlfriend because her friends didn't think he was man enough. William meets a young lady named Andrea, who seems to appreciate his sensitivity and he falls deeply in love with her. The only problem is that she is not free to love him in return. William pours his heart and soul into his relationship only to receive very little in return. Opening himself up to remember the pain and tears caused in past relationships, William reflects on how those experiences formed him into the man he is today.  <br /> <br />As William becomes more successful in his career, he is failing miserably in his relationships. He starts to think that maybe women are not into a man with a sensitive nature, one who is willing to put his lady before himself. A man who is willing to sacrifice the time it takes to make the relationship work. All the women seem to appreciate that he is a good man, telling him \\"don't change\\", but they don't seem to want to be in a relationship with him. This prompted him to change his attitude about relationships. He started entering relationships purely for physical pleasure instead of for love. During his self-reflection, he realizes he is not satisfied with the way things are and decides to listen to his heart. But is it too late?  <br /> <br />The debut novel by William Frederick Cooper seems semi-autobiographical. There is a really moving prayer at the end of the novel that will melt even the coldest of hearts. The approach of the book is different because the tables have been turned and it is a brother who is seeking true love. He presents love from a man's perspective and the result is truly refreshing. There is talk that we will see William McCall again in a future novel. I hope that his prayer will be answered.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Paula Henderson for Loose Leaves Book Review <br />	2004-11-03

The debut novel, Getting Our Breath Back by author Shawne Johnson brilliantly portrays the bond sisters share. Set in the turbulent era of the 60s and 70s, it centers around three sisters who are deeply affected, in different ways by the death of their father.  <br /> <br />Rose, the youngest sister is the central character; she makes her living carving images of women out of wood and stone. Having grown up in a house full of women and having a daughter herself, she is very familiar with the essence of femininity. A relationship from her past leaves her afraid to get close to any other man. And a secret kept from her child will eventually affect their relationship.  <br /> <br />Lilly is the middle sister. She's the pretty one that everyone likes. An ex-Black Panther and poet, Lilly hides from reality in her drug induced world. After the death of her father and several prominent black male figures of the Civil Rights Movement, she can no longer depend and trust in the reality of a strong black man. She escapes to her own world where she can continue to live her childhood.  <br /> <br />Violet is the oldest of the three sisters. After the death of their father, she constantly searches for love and affection from men. She is the perfect wife to her husband and mother to her sons. Her devotion to them requires that she maintain an immaculate home as well as a flawless appearance. Even with all of this she is not able to satisfy her philandering husband. Each sister experiences situations, which cause her to confront the obstacles they each face.  <br /> <br />When I first started reading, I was turned off by the author's overuse of the word \\"and.\\" The more I read, I began to pick on up her cadence and 'was able' to flow with her rhythmic prose. Johnson's descriptive imagery is very colorful when painting a scene. The reader is drawn into the atmosphere, complete with the images and scents Johnson describes. This is excellent writing for a debut author. I've already picked up her second novel, Eden Ohio.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Paula Henderson of Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-11-03

Somehow pregnancy brings out either the best or the worst in a man.  For some it's like being trapped in the proverbial lion's den where only God can help you.  For others it's the best thing since sliced bread - a welcomed surprise.  For Shawn Wayne, it's a toss up.  He suddenly experiences feelings he's never felt before.  Dad Interrupted begins with Shawn finding out that he's about to become a dad and he's not ready for this.  To him, this is an interruption in his life's plan. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />After Shawn loses his mother to a heart attack he takes a siesta from the dating game.  Then he meets Troi.  She helps him through the hard times by giving him the best physical contact a man can imagine.  Suddenly she disappears, without explanation, leaving him heart broken.  Dawn, an old high school friend, comes to the rescue and helps mend his broken heart and Shawn believes he's finally found his soul mate.  His life is finally back on track until he gets a message from Troi saying, \\"I'm pregnant, I'm moving back to D.C. and you're the father.\\"  Say what?  Shawn is flabbergasted. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />On New Year's Eve Shawn tells his two best friends, Kelly and Donnie, about his unexpected news.  He asks advice on how to break the news to Dawn.  Donnie suggests he doesn't tell Dawn, because the baby might not be his.  Kelly suggests the opposite and says he should be a man and accept his responsibility after being careless enough to have unprotected sex.  The drama unfolds when Dawn is told...on national TV, while taping her live show in Shawn's apartment.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The news affects everyone and yet Shawn manages to get stuck in the what-about-me mode of thinking.  He wants to have say in the decision to have or not have a child, but he can't.  The decision has been made by Troi and he has to deal with it.  And so will Dawn, if she chooses too. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Dad Interrupted humors you with \\"The Seven Types of Dads.\\"  Whitfield ties them into Shawn's emotions and how he deals with the reality of becoming a father, whether he's ready or not.  I would almost be inclined to market this book as self-help with a comedic twist.  In the end, an important lesson dealing with consequences of your actions is planted into the mind of the reader.  Whitfield makes you laugh, cry, think and then leaves you with the most powerful words, \\"Fatherhood is a privilege.\\"  Let the church say: Amen. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-28

Her life seems so close to perfection that her best friend Gayle spends many years trying to be like her.  <br /> <br />When Rayne survives a terrible car accident that leaves her husband and her five-year-old daughter dead, the seemingly perfect life is gone and things begin to change. After the accident she moves in with her father and stepmother, but this move results in Rayne's attempt at taking her life by slitting her wrists. Consequently, she is admitted to a mental institution where she refuses to utter a word.  <br /> <br />While many assume the death of Rayne's husband and child is what sends her over the edge, Dr. Pauline Dennis, Rayne's psychologist, discovers there is something more to her mental breakdown, something stemming from her childhood. Pauline recognizes the signs because she too is haunted by demons from her past, which she has yet to address. In fact, helping Rayne on her road to recovery appears to be therapeutic for the doctor.  <br /> <br />After months of therapy, Rayne progresses from silence to heavy sighs and finally to brief conversations. She even befriends Robert, the gardener at the institution, whose father is a patient at the facility. Robert, too, is dealing with problems from the past. He is battling feelings of abandonment, which leave him teetering between resentment and unconditional love for his father. Interestingly, Rayne helps Robert to maintain a sense of hope and he in turn proves to be an important part of her recovery.  <br /> <br />As Rayne begins to make serious progress and confides in Pauline, the story takes a climatic turn when Pauline's supervisor, Dr. Howell, orders shock treatment for Rayne. Pauline, however, believes her patient is far from needing shock therapy. In a desperate act to save Rayne, the doctor risks her career and arranges for Rayne to escape from the hospital and stay with Gayle.  <br /> <br />At Gayle's house, Pauline continues the therapy treatments and meets \\"the other Rayne,\\" the split personality that not even Rayne knows she has. This strong personality has been protecting her since the trauma she endured as a child. Several life-changing revelations are made and while Rayne begins the healing process, Gayle, Robert and Pauline also come to grips with their respective issues of the past.  <br /> <br />Bestselling author Donna Hill has done a magnificent job of researching mental illness and crafting a poignant tale that is not only believable and compelling, but also a masterful depiction of survival. With In My Bedroom, Hill paints a vivid picture of one's psychological struggle with repressed memories of incest and multiple personality disorder, and manages to tug at the reader's emotion until the final page.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Joan Burke Stanford of Loose Leaves Book Review <br /> <br />	2004-10-27

When she should have been crying, and perhaps filing for divorce, Rita took the lyrics to heart: \\"No woman no cry/ No woman no cry/Little darlin' don't shed no tears...\\" and she didn't.  <br /> <br />With this biography, Rita Marley takes readers on an extraordinary journey from humble beginnings in Trench Town, Jamaica to worldwide stardom. She talks about how she went from Alfarita Constantia Anderson, an ambitious little girl with dreams of becoming the next Diana Ross, to Rita Marley, a singer, mother and wife of a reggae music icon.  <br /> <br />Growing up in a third world ghetto full of killers, thieves and prostitutes is no small feat. Rita shares some of her innermost thoughts, including how she was essentially abandoned by her mother and raised by her father, who later immigrated to England. Her mother figure was her beloved Aunty who was there for her through thick and thin. Rita also reveals how she had to deal with black-on-black discrimination because of her dark complexion.  <br /> <br />With a musical background (her father played the tenor sax, her aunt sang in the choir and her uncle was a well-known baritone), Rita was destined to sing. At the age of ten she won her first radio competition. She and her cousin Dream would later put on shows for the community.  <br /> <br />But at age eighteen, Rita finds herself unwed and pregnant, a cardinal sin in Aunty's house, but she manages. A year later she meets Robert \\"Robbie\\" Nesta Marley of the Wailers, a shy guitarist with whom she falls in love and marries. Much like their romance, life with Bob was a whirlwind of activities from becoming Rastafarian and being an entrepreneur to having three more kids, going on tour as a backup singer, and later discovering Bob's numerous affairs.  <br /> <br />Through it all, Rita is strong. She remains tough when her husband's life, as well as her own, is threatened. She maintains her strength when Bob is diagnosed with cancer and later succumbs to the disease. She even keeps a poker face when people doubt her ability to manage Bob's estate and musical legacy. Not only is Rita a woman of great emotional strength, she's simply a good woman.  <br /> <br />\\"People still look for that good woman behind every strong man. We need to bring that good woman forward, especially in Jamaica, where we have been so far behind...It's important for us to move that good woman from behind to beside-and sometimes in front!\\" {page 204}  <br /> <br />Without knowing it, Rita Marley is the \\"good woman\\" she mentions and I commend her for sharing her life with the world in this candid, but carefully written memoir.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Joan Burke Stanford for Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-27

This book falls into the self-help and women's studies category and explains how black women should embrace their inner \\"Angry Black Woman\\" or ABW and how to understand the frustrations, stresses, and trivial things that manage to create havoc in our lives.  <br /> <br />What makes this book so easy to read is that the authors combine their thoughts with examples, humor, and scenarios in which the reader can easily relate. It covers areas such as: identifying which type of ABW you are, dealing with other people (white and black), and communicating in relationships with spouses and children. My favorite chapter of the book is the history section in which they showcased prominent women in our past and present (even fictional characters from movies and books) who have made an impact on society and how their ABW \\"syndrome\\" assisted them in their endeavors. There is also a chapter thrown in about the angry white woman.  <br /> <br />For those who consider themselves an ABW, or who may be in situations where you lose your temper, this would probably shed a little light on why. It may also be interesting reading if you're trying to understand other ABWs. While I found the book a bit humorous in spots, in others it seemed too stereotypical and read as if the authors were trying too hard to be funny. Overall, it was conversational and light in tone and through some of the quizzes I found myself uttering an \\"I know that's right\\" or \\"you go girl\\" or something of this nature, in agreement with the authors.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Mz.

Arthur broke all the rules in this romance novel. The characters intertwined in the romance are intriguing and will leave you wanting more. Cienna Turner is a gorgeous attorney on the fast track to partner. She does not have time to be bothered with anything other than work. Keith Page is the most attractive man at the firm and has a way of getting any women he wants - or needs. Keith is goal centered in the workplace but cannot keep his mind off Cienna. Raleigh Simms is the client who cannot keep his hands to himself and doesn't discriminate between men and women. Mionne is the firm's administrative assistant with a secret side job that boosts her self-worth (for a while anyway). Reka is the know-it-all receptionist and Tacoma is the office assistant and resident expert on relationships. Reka and Tacoma add comedy to this romance with their conversation and jokes.  <br /> <br />Cienna and Keith are paired to represent Raleigh in a sexual harassment case. This case will make or break their careers. The sexual attraction between the two becomes all encompassing and eventually they give into the desires of the flesh. In the meantime, Raleigh makes the mistake of his lifetime - he falls head over heels for Cienna and will do anything to make her his girlfriend. Cienna is offended by his advances and threatens to file her own sexual harassment charges.  <br /> <br />The story takes an attention-grabbing turn when Cienna and Keith admit their feelings toward one another. Mionne becomes jealous of Cienna's seemingly \\"have it all\\" lifestyle and uncovers a secret that will rock the firm.  <br /> <br />Office Policy offers romance, suspense, and drama with a twist, which will leave your mouth open. This romance novel has a plot like no other and characters much like those who work in my office. The author tackles the issue of sexual harassment head on while keeping you interested in the love developing between Cienna and Keith. The book also reads as a suspenseful mystery of love and money. A.C. Arthur definitely has a winner. The next time you want to curl up with a good romance that has some teeth, read Office Policy.  <br /> <br />Rreviewed by Monique Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-25

It is clear that her husband, Jacob Scott, is a controlling abuser, just as her father had been. Annie has seen more than her fair share of abuse and in order to keep some peace of mind an alter ego, Febe, emerges to take control and give her life some order.  <br /> <br />One evening, Febe is not strong enough to overpower the drug-induced control of Jacob. The result: Febe spent almost a year in a coma. Gloria is a wealthy God-fearing, emotionally abused wife who volunteers at the hospital. She takes to Febe, adopts her into the family and loves her back from the coma that threatened to take her life. Febe spends years attempting to put her life back together. Doctors, months of rehabilitation, hatred for men and endless hours of dedication to the local women's shelter finally helps break through the barricades that surround her heart and memory.  <br /> <br />Just when Febe thinks things couldn't get any worse, her best friend died. This forces pieces of her memory back, a young man becomes interested in her, and the shelter is to be closed. How is Febe going to take care of women going through domestic violence now? Febe enlists JayR and his crew to take charge of her revenge idea.  <br /> <br />The twists and turns at the end of this novel were exciting and unpredictable. The idea of a romance novel wrapped in domestic violence was a new and uncomfortable experience for me but definitely drove home the author's statement that \\"love hurts when it comes from a fist\\".  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Monique Bruner of Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-25

The story begins in 1750 as the William George slave ship transports its load across the Atlantic. A distant relative of the slaves slips onboard to wreak havoc on the all-European crew. Siata Quattarra brutally kills several crewmembers, which leads to freeing of the slaves stored below. The horror that unfolds eventually leads to the ships demise as it shipwrecks on the outskirts of an island in the Caribbean. The sole survivor is a vampire who eventually begins to reside in Washington, D.C.  <br /> <br />Fast-forward 100 years; Henry Cheeks masterminds the blood and plasma industry in Africa. This blood cartel is equal to drug trafficking in Cuba. In Africa, the locals discuss vampire activity but nothing is confirmed until an American journalist stumbles upon the truth. The vampires are in for the fight of their life with Isaish \\"Black Rush\\" Zacharias as their leader. Black Rush, Night, Netty Boo, and Aisha function much like a gang as they stalk the streets and suck the blood out of unsuspecting Americans. They are producing horror and hundreds of unexplained deaths in our nation's capital. They have a way of enticing individuals into escapades of sex and love that end in bloodletting and death for the human.  <br /> <br />Richardson truly impressed me with this rendition of vampires living among humans. He carefully adds his African American heritage in this tale of vampires, witchcraft, and threat to America's blood supply. He uses vivid descriptions, which produces a story that is somewhat believable. It had me looking over my shoulder and checking the teeth of my neighbor. This is definitely one to read especially if you are a lover of vampire stories.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Monique Bruner of Loose Leaves Book Review <br />	2004-10-25

What's even more strange is the killer appears to be a woman, out to rid the world of womanizing men. Talk about a woman scorned! She calls herself L.K., aka Lady Killer, and leads the police on a chase to find her and the connection between her victims.  <br /> <br />Detective Jaz Ballantine is on the case after he loses GQ, his foster brother, to the Lady Killer. Though he's closely linked to GQ, Jaz remains on the case, set on finding out who not only killed him, but also mutilated the body in the process. He calls on his ex-wife Dhana to assist in finding the killer. A psychologist skilled in profiling criminals, Dhana is not convinced working with Jaz is in her best interest. Though divorced for several years, she's still harboring feelings for him and is hesitant to commit to spending more time with him than necessary.  <br /> <br />As the story progresses, the Lady Killer seeks out Dhana, feeling a sense of familiarity with her. More bodies are found and the attraction between Jaz and Dhana grows. One is not certain how things will end, but it will definitely be an ending you'll rush to get to.  <br /> <br />Gail McFarland has the gift of storytelling and should be commended on how masterfully she crafted Lady Killer. It is an exciting, suspenseful, and somewhat provocative story about what a person is capable of becoming in the future as a result of their past.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Mz.

Darnella Ford addresses this question in Crave, her sophomore effort and shows the frailty of the human need to love and to be loved. It is a somewhat dark story of a woman who missed out on love and affection as a child and how it affects her when she gets older, basically leaving her with a craving to be loved, suffering from illusions of normality, and a low self-esteem that controls her decisions.  <br /> <br />Michael Morgan is confused about life and love and is convinced that through her sexual exploits she can find a man who will give her the love she seeks. Almost in a daze and going from man to man, she doesn't quite grasp that love cannot be found between the sheets. Because of this, she sets herself up for constant heartbreak, pain and misery. While the trauma of her situation should eventually wake her up from her actions, she can't release the yearning she has inside. Just when she is at her lowest, she meets a wonderful white man who she's not so sure about initially, but then she ends up falling for him -- falling in the worse way. It is the way that Michael is known for falling for men (hard and quick) in an unending cycle on her search to love.  <br /> <br />The characters, both protagonists and antagonists were well-defined and yet vague when needed, offering a perfect balance to this disturbing, yet sometimes funny book. I especially liked the interactions between Michael and her two best friends in the book, both of whom are suffering with their own issues of drug addiction and homosexuality.  <br /> <br />Poetic and dramatic, Crave is a relationship novel, yet it crosses the line into something more and stands out on its own. Darnella Ford definitely has a unique writing style that I enjoyed in her first effort Rising, but I liked it just as well with Crave. Addressing the issues of self-worth and mental illness with the normal story lines of other relationship novels made thisbook more alive, more focused, and more set on bringing the lessons home.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Mz.

The poems are divided into seven different areas, which focus on life and how dramatically it has affected the author. ZaKiYa pours her heart and soul into the soulful words that leap from the page. This personal touch goes even deeper with an open letter to America about the tragedy of September 11, 2001 and how she came to write this collection of poetry along with a mini autobiography. The poems are deeply personal and by reading each, the reader knows a little more about ZaKiYa. Her poetry indicates an intense emotion that ties each poem together.  <br /> <br />I believe the language used throughout the book is strong and sometimes offensive. The combination of word choice, type font, and page layout impedes the flow of the poetry. I feel Muted Whispers is speaking to the urban brothers and sisters much like today's rap videos. I believe the younger readers will relate to and appreciate this new promising poet.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Monique Bruner for Loose Leaves Book Review <br /> <br />	2004-10-25

Denise Richardson awakens and immediately senses something is amiss in her apartment. And she's right. Two thugs have broken in and are trying to kill her. She escapes and runs through her complex screaming for help. Her only hope appears to be Mrs. Sheldon, her elderly neighbor, who doesn't hear so well. But, as fate would have it, it's too late. One of the intruders gets to Mrs. Sheldon first and Denise watches in horror as he slits her neighbor's throat.           Can things get any worse? Of course. When Denise goes to the police station with details regarding the murder, the officers seem to doubt her story. Detective Terrence O'Neal looks into the interrogation room and is instantly taken by Denise's beauty. However, he, too, wonders if she is telling the truth. Although Denise is attracted to Terrence, she is irritated by his line of questioning, which implies that she is a suspect. To make matters worse, a few days later it is discovered that Mrs. Sheldon left the apartment complex and a considerable amount of money to Denise.           As the story progresses, Denise's life is still in danger and Terrence, as the lead detective on the case, is tasked with finding out who is trying to kill his witness and why? Meanwhile, he struggles to keep his amorous feelings for Denise in check. But when she is involved in a serious car accident at the hands of the killers, Terrence and Denise quickly realize they are falling in love. The detective is even more determined to solve the case. As clues are revealed, he discovers that reopening a previous case may be the key.           Although the story line seemed vastly familiar, the characters are believable and developed well. Like all romance novels, it's happily ever after, but the journey from murder mystery to \\"love conquers all\\" with a little betrayal in between was enjoyable.

US	27290383	R399HI62JSDLYX	5559608319	311140684	Love	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Title to be Revised	It was originally titled The Sporting Woman and I couldn't understand why.  I asked others if they had read Love and the popular response was, \\"I don't do Toni (Morrison) because it takes too long to get into her stories.\\"  We are a society of instant gratification and Love does require some deep thought.  In fact, this is my second time reading it and now I've found a new angle to the story.  I actually found the Sporting Woman the book would have been titled after...and I also found Love.  <br /> <br />Morrison often writes about sporting women and other indiscretions that are usually taboo in the African American community.  Bill Cosey - businessman extraordinaire - marries Heed when she is only 11 years old and he in his 50s.  What could a grown man possibly want with a girl child so young?  Had he not married her, it would have been considered pedophilia.  Heed was good friends with his granddaughter, Christine.  In fact, they even called themselves best friends until the marriage took place.  That's when Love ceased to exist between them.  This event is the catalyst to the story and as the plot thickens each spends the rest of their life trying to determine which is the \\"sweet Cosey child\\" designated in Bill Cosey's will to gain his entire estate.  <br /> <br />There were also other characters that shaped the story.  May, Vida, Sandler, Romen, Junior (but you can call her June), a few others sporadically mentioned...and then there was L.  L is the only person who speaks in first person as if she's the visionary who sees and knows all that is happening.  She gives you insight, like that of a narrator, that helps you better understand the chapter that follows her narration.  Be careful not to misconstrue what is being said, although that might not always be easy.   <br /> <br />Morrison never falters on her ability to make you think.  I mean really think.  If you're not adept and even a borderline intellect, then most of the story will \\"go over your head.\\"  Where does Love come in?  It could be about love lost, love gained and love given away; it's all about how you read the story and what you get out of it.  Many may pass it up simply because it's a Morrison novel.  She eloquently delivers Love in only 208 pages.  I once had a friend say, \\"I'm not grown enough to read her books; I have to wait until I mature.\\"  Funny.  Morrison books have become required reading in many high school English classes.  If you need a boost, I'd suggest reading The Bluest Eyes first, then tackling Love.  You'll see the difference in how much easier this read is.  I bow to Toni Morrison and her ability to continually make me think and have fun doing it.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays of Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-24

The stories speak of the struggles black men have regarding themselves and their relationships. The book consists of seven very quick and interesting tales.    Satan's Anvil, the first in the collection of stories, centers on two lifelong friends engaged in a game of chess. Piano Man and Juke reminisce about their years as members of the same band. Recalling old gigs and past loves, the conversation takes a more serious turn as Juke presses Piano Man for answers to several questions regarding long buried secrets. The situation escalates with tragic results as another member of the band, Kong, joins the conversation.    Little Red Robin Hood is a story about a man's struggle with discovering life's true meaning and his purpose. It is portrayed through a telephone conversation between Andrew, the main character, and his fiance, Molly. His daughter has managed to intertwine the titles of Little Red Riding Hood and Robin Hood to come up with Little Red Robin Hood. And it is her interpretation of the story which has Andrew pondering the direction his life should go.    The Chinese Finger Trap is a thoroughly entertaining tale about a young man's quest to find the meaning of an insignia he notices several people wearing. Tshombe is a street vendor who sells wooden flutes. An encounter with an elderly white woman wearing a pendant prompts him to inquire about it. This begins his obsessive journey to discover its meaning. A chance meeting with a beautiful sister named Jesse leads him to the answer he seeks.    The next three stories in the collection contain two recurring characters, Willie and Mack. In Slick's Lick, Willie and Mack run into each other on the street. Mack calls Willie by the name Ubangi which he had adopted during his stint with the Black Panthers. Willie is a real estate agent and does some reflecting on the person that he was when he referred to himself as Ubangi.    In Willie's Dice, Willie is now an insurance salesman, but he approaches Mack with a new plan to make money. Mack refuses to participate in this new venture upon initial presentation. After learning that Willie has been very successful in his new endeavor, Mack wants in.    Falling Off The Wing is the final story of the adventures of Willie and Mack. Animosity has set in between the two old friends. Willie is struggling with not being satisfied with his success. With feelings of dissatisfaction, Willie makes some major changes in his life.    Obi is an excellent storyteller. All of the stories in the collection were really good. He touches on the thoughts and feelings his characters have being black males in our current society. Satan's Anvil is an enjoyable collection of short stories.    Reviewed by Paula Henderson for Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-24

His goal is to start his own firm and a family, in that order.

To her dismay, a visit to the obstetrician reveals that Monica was never really pregnant, she only had symptoms.  In fact, she will never be able to conceive; she's going through premature menopause.  The news is devastating to Monica.  She doesn't know how to tell her husband so she doesn't; instead she tells him she's suffered a miscarriage.  The truth is revealed when Nate answers the phone and hears a fertility doctor calling to confirm an appointment.          From this point, the story becomes ridiculous.  Nate wants to let his wife know how hurt he is by finding out they will never be able to conceive children together.  He wants a divorce but quickly changes his mind once he finds out Monica will be entitled to half his fortune; thirty million dollars.  However, there is a clause in their prenuptial agreement that states if she's caught cheating, she gets nothing. So he devises a plan to make her commit adultery.           I read it in less than a week.  Not the typical RM novel.  The Harris Men, The Harris Family and Father Found were all thought provoking novels by RM Johnson.  It seems he has changed up, catered to the masses and started writingmore contemporary novels.  I wasn't impressed with his last novel, Dating Games or this one. The Million Dollar Divorce story seemed realistic enough but the ending was too contrived.  If you like fast reads that get to the point without suspense, then this is one to read.

The reason Jada starts speaking has Aja peeved and old feelings, she's been trying to get rid of, start to resurface.  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />My Brother's Keeper is about what happens when we let things that happened in the past fester inside our heart.  Of course, it's not easy to let go of the past hurt and yet it's not conducive to hold onto to it with a tight grip either.  Aja tries hard to be the glue to keep her family together, but soon realizes that she can't do it alone.  My Brother's Keeper takes you through an emotionally charged story about the love a family has for one another.

I've always been plump, thick, plentiful, or whatever you want to call a person who surpasses the single digit clothes sizes, but I've never read a book that celebrates big and beautiful women.  Author L. Edwards has written this type of a tribute to big girls everywhere.  Watch Out for the Big Girls! should be read, cherished, and shared with both family and friends of all sizes.    In the author's much too short collection of poetry, short stories, and thoughts, the reader is given a view into the world of big women.  Ms. Edwards clearly shows that regardless of size, these women have feelings, desires, and dreams just as their slimmer counterparts.  It is not only a tribute, but also a declaration of acceptance, self-worth, and pride -- all in being a big girl. My favorite part of this collection is the short story entitled \\"Big & Beautiful\\" which focuses on the dating scene, how men react to bigger women, both in public and in private, and how a woman's self-esteem can be affected by her weight.    While I enjoyed Watch Out for the Big Girls, it would have been better if Ms. Edwards would have added more stories to complement the theme  The book was much too small and seemed to be rushed.

A commotion one evening prompts concern and it's the beginning to the end for Neet, Shay, Alberta, Louise and Joe's relationship.  They are each forced to evaluate themselves and their love for one another.  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />Johnetta keeps the gossip hot in the neighborhood.  The latest rumor is about a crazy lady, with nothing but a tie-dyed shirt on, roaming Cecil Street.   A man named Luther, with a scar across his face, is looking for her.  Johnetta and most of the neighborhood believe the crazy lady, Duecie, has ties to Alberta.  Duecie is dying and her last hope is to find her daughter before she takes her final breath.  But before she gets to her daughter, she suffers one of her headaches and ends up finding refuge in someone's cellar...on Cecil Street.  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />Tim has rats in the apartment above his barbershop.  At least that's what he tells his wife Nathina.  It's really a lavish apartment that his regulars use when they need to escape and the code is \\"how are the rats?\\"  BB has what's called the \\"Saturday Morning\\" house.  The name is given because of what's been rumored to happen on Saturday mornings.  When someone from the neighborhood visits the house on Wednesday, all hell breaks loose and the people of Cecil Street have to pull together to keep the police from asking too many questions.  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />The mood in the neighborhood becomes somber.  Joe and the other men of Cecil Street feel a block party will lift everyone's spirits.  It's during the block party when the pieces of the puzzle start to come together. Eventually someone ends up Leaving Cecil Street, but who?   <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />Leaving Cecil Street has a slow beginning.  Once the pace accelerates, it is hard to put the book down.  Heartwarming.  Set in the 60s, it tells about how neighborhoods used to be, but not anymore.  Makes you reminisce about \\"back in the day\\" when things were cool.  The ending will catch you by surprise.  Kudos to McKinney-Whetstone for a book well-written.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-24

However, Mirror Mirror by Laurel Handfield is far from a fairytale and Jordan Overton, the main character, is no Snow White.  <br /> <br />At twenty-eight years old, Jordan is slightly overweight and suffers from low self-esteem, which Terry, her gay roommate tries to boost on a regular basis. He offers to do her hair, encourages her to lose weight and even buys her outfits occasionally to spruce up her look and elevate her confidence.  <br /> <br />Jordan suddenly welcomes Terry's makeover suggestions when she starts working as a temp at PHC Industries. At the workplace she finds herself attracted to Trent Prescott, one of the owners of the company, and often fantasizes about having an office romance with him even though he's married. Rather than work for William Hines, the tyrant boss who orders her around and belittles her, she would love to be Trent's secretary. So when Trent calls her at home desperately needing help to complete a project, she races back to the office; Jordan to the rescue.  <br /> <br />Thanks to Terry's makeup mastery and a little weight loss, Jordan actually receives compliments from Trent, which could be construed as innocent or not-so-innocent flirting. Later, he invites her to dinner. Ultimately, her dreams come true and she has sex with Trent. Although it didn't quite happen the way she had envisioned it would, she is happily on cloud nine.  <br /> <br />But when she finds Mr. Hines dead in his office, her world turns upside down and her happiness turns to confusion. To make matters worse, she is the key suspect. Strange things start to happen. A detective tells her that Hines left his portion of PHC Industries to her. But why? Didn't Hines hate her? Also, why does Trent want her to lie about his whereabouts? Then there's Gerald, a nosy coworker who starts acting bizarre. Plus, Terry suddenly seems to have lots of extra money lately.  <br /> <br />Mirror Mirror is Laurel Handfield's second book, but her debut to the mystery genre. She does a great job of weaving a suspenseful story that forces readers to want to find the killer. Unpredictable is the key word because you'll never guess \\"whodunit.\\" The pacing at the beginning of the book is slow. In fact, there is no real action within the first sixty pages. In addition to a slow start, the author uses words that do not fit the flow of some sentences, ultimately creating reading speed bumps. Another story stall is introducing the character Hattie, a living fixture on the bus that Jordan rides to and from work. She seems to have no purpose other than to remind Jordan to look at herself. Mirror Mirror may not be the fairest of them all, but it's an intriguing mystery that will keep you guessing until the end. Just like a fairytale, someone does live happily ever after, but readers will be surprised to find out who.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Joan Burke Stanford for Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-24

Reg) has to spend in the prison for committing credit card fraud. The author doesn't give detail of the offense and I'd assume there was a prior offense because he was already on probation and a \\"detainer\\" by the probation office is the main reason he's confined for eight months, as opposed to a couple of days.  I'm confused.  So the question is: What was he on probation for?  Was it for committing credit card fraud or something else?  <br /> <br />The memoir starts with his initial intake, goes through his perils of being gay and in prison and ends at outtake.  Hall speaks of the incidents he was subjected to just for being gay (i.e., attempted rape, gay bashing, and assault).  He also brings to light another interesting subject that seems to plague Black men - homosexual behavior while inmates.  There were a few instances where Reg noted he had \\"crushes\\" on a few \\"straight\\" men and one ultimately led to a sexual encounter.  However, the person he had the encounter with emphasized that he didn't \\"go that way\\" yet he went there with Reg.  How scary is that?   <br /> <br />Memoir: Delaware County Prison reads like he has jotted down his memory of the incidents but without much detail.  It misses the most important element - a plot.  To have been written by a teenager, expressing his horrible time in prison, it's cute.  The synopsis makes the book seem interesting; however, none of the subjects were touched upon.  Had he given detail on his attempting suicide, taking drugs, engaging in other self-destructive behavior, along with \\"why\\" he was in prison it would have made for a more interesting read.  But for now it's just - cute. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays for Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-24

When she meets Rhys Langston, aka Omega, in a chat-room, she realizes that he has figured out things about her that no other man has.  On a whim, she invites him to her birthday party and he accepts.  If only life were that easy... <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />What ensues is chaos, in its truest form.  Although her boss is engaged to be married, when he realizes that she is determined to start seeing someone else, his true feelings emerge.  Her ex-boyfriend, Rupert, can't stand the thought of her rejection and vows to fight for her to come back.  How does a woman deal with all of this and still keep her wits? <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />Rhys Langston is every woman's dream come true, and they immediately hit it off.

Can Paige get over her false beliefs and premonitions of what true love isn't, and accept the challenge of following her heart? <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />This love story is embroiled with fast-paced drama and suspense.

While dating her beau of two years, Romance, Lily is faced with the decision of trying to overcome her insecurities and quirks within her relationship.  What transpires, however, is something entirely different than what she expected.<br /><br />Romance, in love with Lily, only wants the best but doesn't know how to show it.  Instead of tackling the problems head-on, he constantly puts himself first and not the relationship.  When things become heated, he proposes instead of trying to resolve their differences.  Lily, never taking the opportunity to confront Romance with her true feelings, finally lets him know how she feels, which results in a major argument.  Licking her wounds, she runs into Will Dickson, or Dick, as his friends call him, and their relationship becomes more than what she bargained for.<br /><br />Dick and Lily are soulfully connected from the very beginning, and Lily begins spending time with him, not anticipating the proposal from Romance.  When Lily does decide to accept Romance's proposal, she writes them both a letter; one a poem to Romance professing her love, and the other to Dick, breaking things off.  The letters get switched and everything goes awry.<br /><br />Realizing her relationship with Romance is definitely over, Lily pursues something more with Dick.  Not wanting to settle for what Dick is offering, Lily moves to Kansas City where she meets the man of most women's dreams: Wealth Fulmore.  Not really feeling Wealth, Lily still continues to date him, at the same time harboring feelings for his twin brother, Winston.<br /><br />What ensues is the realization of coming full circle.  As Lily realizes that she truly does love Dick, she has to deal with him being in the arms of another woman.  Although every woman would love to have Dick, Romance and Wealth at their disposal, the real question one must ask is: at what cost?  Through poetry and life changing events, Lily finally discovers who she really is.<br /><br />While the concept of the novel was creative, there were too many grammatical, typographical and stylistic errors.  This remained constant throughout the reading, distracting from the overall intent of the story.  The storyline was also a little far-fetched, but the poetry was excellent and thought-provoking.

Raven Klein is a bi-racial teenager who lives in Iowa with her white foster mother who works at a diner. Dealing with racist comments from the local community and being the object of the white boys sexual curiosity, Raven wishes for a better life. One day she hops a bus, leaving Iowa behind to search for a place where she can connect with her African American roots. A chance meeting with Nia at the bus station leads Raven to Atlanta. What she finds there is a drama filled life that includes sex, money and intrigue.    Nia, a former stripper turned music video dancer, has dreams of becoming an R&B singer. Nia is the top girl in Rico's harem of strippers. No longer having to strip for Rico, Nia has enough pull with him to offer Raven a place to stay and assistance with a job. After reneging on a promise to Rico, Nia's role as Rico's top girl is quickly replaced by Raven.    Rico is the owner of two Atlanta area strip clubs, one for the everyday working man and another for stars in the music and sports industry.  When he recognizes what an asset Raven is to his business, he gives her part ownership in the clubs and even proposes marriage.    Tyanna, Nia's tri-sexual friend (she'll try anything sexually), brings in big dollars for Raven. Having once sought revenge on Raven for causing Nia to lose her position with Rico, Tyanna later realizes that Raven has her back as well as Nia after she performs several favors for them. Tyanna returns the favors by helping to save her from a deadly situation.    I was truly caught up in this book. The erotic scenes were hot! Murder, blackmail and deception spices the story as Raven finds true love. Nia receives the fame that she seeks and Rico gets what is coming to him when his actions catch up with him.

Regardless of her love for her husband Emory, she is thrown when her first true love returns, opening the door to a past she has tried to leave behind.  Despite his involvement with and then marriage to her best friend, Phillip is back in town, bringing his betrayal to the front of Suvie's mind, and trying to reclaim what they once had. As she battles to keep her feelings at bay and maintain her marriage vows, she is caught in a whirlwind of emotions, what-ifs, and confusion.     If these issues weren't enough, she is also faced with problems involving her daughters; one has an eating disorder and the other is a bit too ready to claim the title of woman.  While being caught up in her own matters of the heart, she almost loses sight when it comes to being a mother and protecting and guiding her children through life.

Additionally, she broaches topics such as infidelity, eating disorders, and familial strife which are prevalent in our society today and affect our relationships with family and friends.

The argument was: having a \\"page count\\" minimum often adds unnecessary fluff to a novel.  I countered with: sometimes recommending more pages could mean that more depth, description, plot, etc. needs to be added to the story to improve its presentation.  That's my sentiment with Different Trees from the Same Root.  Reading it was comparable to running in a relay...on your mark, get set, GO!  Run as fast as you can until you reach the finish line. <br /> <br />Different Trees from the Same Root begins with first person narratives of its main characters - Delilah \\"Journey\\", Walter, Rachel and Christina.  Each tells their story and their struggles.  A good beginning but somewhere between Chapters 4 and 6, you suddenly end up in the middle of their lives, without warning.  For instance, Walter and Christina were contemplating dating, next they're dating, then they're married, suddenly they're having a baby, the baby is walking, and...  Stop pushing the fast forward button so I can savor the story.  Unfortunately that's not the case, the same happens with the other two characters.  Rachel had issues with her sexuality, she struggled, she accepted, she moved on.  Journey had issues with her lifestyle, she found an angel who accepted her for who she was, they lived happily ever after, tragedy struck, family was brought together after years of abandonment.  Where is the element of surprise?  As I turned the pages I knew almost verbatim what the next page was going to read. <br /> <br />Different Trees from the Same Root lacked substance; it didn't have enough \\"fluff\\" to keep the reader interested.  Too predictable, not enough description, not enough history, not enough... Every story/life altering event was neatly packaged with a four-page minimum (sometimes less) from each narrator.  Although the stories were good, they could have easily been told in an hour-long conversation.  Not to mention a lot of misplaced metaphors, timelines, names, subplots and plots.  <br /> <br />All is not lost.  Once the storytelling skills are honed and fine tuned, Clarke has a blossoming future as a writer. While Different Trees from the Same Root is mediocre, there is a lot of potential. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays of Loose Leaves Book Review <br />	2004-10-23

He is dating Jean Dobson and she is patiently awaiting a marriage proposal.  A heated tenant association meeting introduces additional characters, one of whom Ashanti is accused of having murdered.     Ashanti is on the lam from the law.  The people he trusts most seem to be untrustworthy, even Jean seems to betray him. Phyllis is the only person he can turn to for help.  The story moves pretty quickly from that point.  It is laden with sex, violence and suspense.    The book left me feeling empty.  There were so many subplots that could have been developed into story lines.   It seems the author centered the story on some very explicit sex scenes instead of telling the story.  I also had a problem with the main character's ability to interact intimately with both male and females    I did enjoy Obi's ability to draw the reader into the story by using the second person viewpoint.  This is very seldom done in a novel and he pulled it off successfully.  With more character and plot development, this would have been a really good book.

She spends several weeks hiding out with Agent Trent Stewart until she can enter the witness protection program. Love blossoms between them,  but they deny the attraction. Angela is given a new identity and a new life. <br /> <br /> <br />The hardest thing Trent ever did was let Angela walk out of his life. He lived every day with his decision not to share his feelings with her. She was out of his life, but never out of his heart. <br /> <br />Two years later, Jane/Angela saves a life and the story and her picture makes headlines on national television.  Trent and a hit man both race against time to find Angela. <br /> <br />Trent will not only put his job on the line, but his heart to keep the woman he loves safe. Angela is thrilled to have Trent back in her life. She is determined to make this time be forever. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the whole premise of the story, but I the relationship between Angela and Trent seemed a little forced at the beginning. The chemistry between the characters wasn't really there. I would recommend Escape to Love to those who like a touch of adventure added to their romance. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Sylvia Willis Lett of Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-23

Melanie is in a tangled web and can't decide whether or not to become a Mrs. or remain Ms. Hitts.  She managed to get Will Freedman's attention and a marriage proposal.  They have a whirlwind relationship that escalates a little too fast for her, as a result she calls off the marriage at the most inopportune time - during the engagement party.  Suddenly there is an overwhelming feeling that getting married would impede on her dream to become a top interior designer.  Feeling the need to get away from the mess she's made, she moves to New York to follow her dream and attempts to make a name for her in the interior design business. <br /> <br />While in New York, Melanie gets another man's attention.  A presentation to one of the top architectural firms tests Melanie's ability to be spontaneous, yet it also gives her an opportunity to strut her stuff and show them what she's working with.  While giving the presentation, she meets the head honcho - John Carlson, an older, married white man who manages to ruffle her feathers a little and vice versa.  The end result is more than either ever imagined. <br /> <br />There's a (not so obvious) message regarding insecurities people have a tendency to deal with.  Sometimes we don't know they exist until someone else brings them to our attention.  The people you associate with can either make you or break you.  Melanie's relationships proved to bring both fulfillment and disappointment.  As a result, she's forced to decide which is most important. <br /> <br />Hitts & Mrs. incorporates a few subplots: Candace (Melanie's best friend) and her inability to keep a \\"good\\" man, Sharon (John's wife) and her struggles with voicing her opinions and Amanda (a troubled teen) who has issues with her mother.  Bryant-Woolridge almost lost me with some of the subplots but somewhere in the middle managed to saveherself and skillfully tie them into the story.  In the end, it all worked out and hence the story won my approval.  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Esther \\"Ess\\" Mays of Loose Leaves Book Review	2004-10-23
