The information in here is nothing that you can't find in any other book that is an introduction to Wicca.  The saddest part is that the title would lead you to believe that the author is going to take up the concept of gay spirituality and look at Wicca for a GLBT perspective.  There  are a lot of ways he could have done this.  The role of homoertocism and gender variance in the history of Paganism and Wicca.  Gay archetypes.  Queer frienly deities.  Gay energy.  None of these issues are addressed.  This book is a major letdown.	2003-06-02

In fact, his books are so profound that I find I have a hard time always understanding them!  Not that this fact makes his books any less enjoyable to read, but just shows how well crafted his books are on every level.  On just a basic level, Sirens is just a good read, full of humor and wit.  But Vonnegut also has alot to say about humanity and yes, even the meaning of life.  I am not sure how to even describe the plot, but it has something to do with the predestined journey of Malachi Constant from Earth to Mars to Mercury to Earth to Titan and back to Earth again.  And through this, Vonnegut makes statements about religion, fate, the military, friendship, and humanity.  Not a book that is easy to wrap your mind around, but still one for the must-read lists.	2001-05-24

When I saw this book I picked it up to get another point of view on this family's unfortunate history.  While Jay Bakker tells the whole story of his life, and of his parent's rise and fall as televangelists, the core of this book is really his reminder that God's love is unconditional.  I admire his vision to bring the Gospel to those who are falling through the cracks in our society.  Despite the great message and interesting content, I gave this book only 3 stars because the writing is only so-so.  I understand that Jay is dyslexic (and I may be too since I don't know how to spell it!) and that may be why the writing is somewhat stiff.  The book slows down at quite a few points, but thankfully it is a quick read.  If you are not too concerned about great writing, then I suggest this as an interesting read and a good reminded to love everyone as Jesus did.	2001-04-21
US	50934740	R3ATHLGPDCIRLG	0375506039	878470234	Open House	Books	5	10	11	N	N	A quick but totally enjoyable read	My wife has been buying all the Oprah books so I thought I would read a few also.  Of the 4 I have read, this is the one I have enjoyed the most.  It's a fast read, and maybe that is my one complaint - we get to know the eccentric characters and we want to read more about them.  The best thing about the book is how it can be laugh-out-loud funny at times yet deal seriously with the feelings of a woman going through divorce.  When the main character's husband leaves her, she is forced to open her home and her life to an array of quirky people.  At heart, this is really a love story about finding someone who loves you for being exactly who you are - weirdness and all.  I am eagerly waiting for the movie with John Goodman in the role of King.  Okay, so it hasn't been made yet, but it should!  This book is a light read, but if you want something that makes you feel good after reading it, then give it a try.	2001-04-19

As a science fiction fan who happens to be a minister, I was looking forward to how James Blish would explore the idea of religion in a sci fi setting.  While I still like the idea, I had a hard time making it through this book.  The book gets off to a good start on the planet Lithia as Sanchez and the others disvocer some surprising revelations and discuss whether or not to allow the planet to be opened up or to close it off to further contact.  However, as soon as we get back to Earth, things slow down considerably and the book loses alot of momentum.  I think the biggest problem is that I wasn't really sure what Blish was trying to say.  What does it all mean.  Of course, this could be a problem of my own ignorance and missing the point rather than a flaw in the book.  If you like your sci fi novels plot driven and full of action, this is not the book for you.  If you like your sci fi to be more thoughtful and character driven, this book might be worth your while to pick up just because it IS one of those classic sci fi novels that made an impact on the genre.  Personally, this is not a book I regret reading, but not one I would want to read again either.  Maybe I just wanted too badly to like it.	2001-04-13

If you can hunt this book down, it is worth the read.  I haven't read any other generation ship stories before this one, but I found this one to not only be enjoyable but also emotionally compelling.  Brian Aldiss is really trying to tell us about the built-in urge to be free and to discover who you really are.  the plot is simple: The characters are on a huge ship hurtling through space but have no idea of that fact and simply know the ship as their world.  The story unfolds as we discover the truth behind where and what the characters are.  If you are interested at in in classic science fiction, then this is worth hunting down.	2001-03-28

It does get a bit overdramatic at times and maybe the plot point of Ben showing up at the front door after ten years stretches reality a little (although there was a real case like this in the 80s), but I don't think that was the point.  The author set up the plot to say something about the emotional states and relationships between the characters and that is what they story is really about.  How do you forgive yourself?  How do you forgive others?  Why are family ties so important?  and What makes a family?  These questions are the core of this book, not the plot per se, and the author does a a good job of pulling the reader into these questions in an emotional way.  Some of the scenes are brilliantly written and very touching for their emotional insight.  This book is not perfect, but it is a good, solid, thought provoking read that has something to say about human nature.	2001-03-19

They are classics for a reason.  This book doesn't deal with big issues of humanity.  It's just great fun!!  It's an old-fashioned adventure tale that pulls you in and keeps you turning the pages.  It has all the making of a traditional action story - a race against time, all sorts of dangerous situations, and, of course, a love interest.  Who would believe that this was written over 100 years ago?  Just more proof that it is a great story that generation after generation will enjoy.  Pick it up, read it, then read it with your kids, and their kids, etc.  Then read it again!	2001-03-03

Bill Myers takes the incredible premise of what if Jesus had come today instead of 2000 years ago?  The mazing thing about this book is that it really makes you think &quot;what if?&quot;  What would he be like?  Who would he talk to?  Who would his followers be?  How would I respond?  Mr. Myers does a fine job of bringing some of Jesus' actions into a modern day framework.  I loved how he told the modern day parable of the prodigal son at a party hosted by an Black gay pron producer who then becomes on of his disciples.  It really hits the nail on the head for today's audience.  His disciples also include former racists and other misfits.  It makes you think how radical Jesus was in HIS day, travelling around with tax collectors and prostitutes.  It also sends a clear message about our consumer Christian culture where we almost live in a &quot;Christian ghetto&quot; with Christian products galore marketed to us left and right.  Is today's material culture, even among Christians something that God would approve of?  All of these issues are brought up in this book.  But do not think it is only intellectual, at a base level, the story is also entertaining.  I enjoyed the characters, expecially Julia, and enjoyed watching the plot unfold on &quot;our&quot; side of the parallel universe.  So if your would like to be entertained but also be made to think, and maybe even have yout faith grow a bit, this is a book that you should pick up.	2001-02-24

However, this book had me from the beginning and I had no trouble staying interested until the end, even though it weighs in at about 700 pages.  Kevin Baker's secret is that he is so familiar with the historicl setting that he is able to write in such detail that you literally feel tranported to turn-of-the-century New York.  The reader gets to know the characters and care about them, even the more eccentric ones.  The story about the harshness of life is at times sad, funny, endearing, and even frightening.  All 700 pages are worth the read.	2001-02-19

I also read the other 2 books in this trilogy but I think that this one is the best of the 3.  It deals with coming of age in a humorous and often poignant way.  All the characters here are well-drawn and very engaging.  I loved getting to know them.  For all the humor in the book, it also manages to be sad sometimes as it deals with issues we all face in life.  Life is hard sometimes, and it can also be fun, as Tim Sandlin teaches us.	2001-02-19

There are no deep issues here, other than the love story, just an adventure that sweeps you along for 150 pages.  The main character is stranded on a foreign planet with no technology and when a space ship arrives he sees his ticket back to civilization.  The story that follows is filled with ships that &quot;sail&quot; on grass instead of water, cannibals, pirates, moving islands, and, of course, a love interest.  Put simply, the book is just a lot of fun.  <br />Unfortunately, the book is out-of-print.  But if you're willing to find an old copy somewhere, it's worth the hunt.	2001-02-19

The writing is good, the characters start off interesting and it seems the plot is going somewhere.  But as I got to about page 200 (or 2/3 through the book) I began to wonder what the author was trying to say.  What's the point?  That life is hard and you just have to get through?  I read one other review that complained that the character of Julie never changed.  I have to agree with that.  There was no growth for her througout the book.  There was no character development, at least for Julie who is supposed to be the protagonist.  And when you don't see growth in the character, all the hardships that are thrown in - the fire, the flood, the death of a child - they all seem pointless.  I have to admit though, some passages were a joy to read for the description and the words used alone.  But that doesn't make a book.  Others liked this book.  It left me scratching my head.	2001-02-18

Both this book and &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; deserve a place in any sci fi library.  One of the things I appreciate about Mr. Bester's books is how creative her is not only in content, but how he expresses that content in writing.  The last few chapters of this book are brilliant.  The main character is pretty disgusting.  He's a rapist and a murderer, but Bester gets you on his side and it's fascinating to watch him grow as a person.  In some ways this book is more a study in psychology than anything else.  Fascinating!!	2001-02-14

You can read the other reviews to find out the basic plot/premise, but I will say that it is at least interesting enough to keep you turning the pages to find out what is going to happen next.  And that's the most important thing in a murder mystery isn't it??  The only dissappointments were that I thought a couple situations (like how they found the coat) a little unbelievable and the ending seemed a little to neat and tidy after being led up to it for 650+ pages.  But other than that, the book was a good, fun read.	2001-02-14

In fact, if Hollywood is looking for a good story, this book would make a great movie.  But as literature I just found it a little uninspired.  Maybe I was expecting something else.  But if you just want a good read and are just looking for entertainment I am sure you'll enjoy the book.

The book starts off strong and  keeps your interest most of the way through, although the last 100 pages  are a bit slow and let you down after the fun read of the first part of the  book.  The book is still worth the read.     The strong point of the book  is the main character who is interesting enough to keep you interest even  when things slow down at the end.  Also, I appreciated the positive and  realistic portrayal of religious faith Grisham gives us.  Christianity is  not glamorized, but it isn't beat up on either like it usually is in books  and movies.  As a Christian missionary who is moving to Dourados, Brazil, I  found this depiction of faith refreshing.     This book can be a great read  if you let it be what it should:  A fun way to pass the time and keep you  entertained.  Just be ready for the (boring) ending.	2000-09-06

That is basically  what Walter Wangerin does in this engaging novel.  Staying true to Biblical  sources, Mr. Wangerin shows us Paul in a way that many people may have  never seen him before.  The Paul we see here is one who is often disliked  by his fellow believers, but always respected.  We see Paul as a man of  such strong convictions that people can't help but have strong reactions to  him, either positive or negative.  The only complaint I had about the book  was that it slowed down in places.  Otherwise, this is a very well-written  fictional account of someone who we know about only in Scripture.  This  novel does a neat job of taking you back to those times when God was moving  in his people and letting you play with the idea of &quot;I wonder what it  might have been like to be there.&quot;  It is well worth the read.	2000-09-06

This book turned a stroke of bad luck on our honeymoon into a honeymoon we will remember.  Our original plans were to do a 7-day cruise, but after flying to Miami and getting an hour out to sea, the engine on our ship  broke and the whole cruise was cancelled.  We flew back home the next day  and decided we would drive to New Orleans.  We picked this book up that  night and it helped us plan an entire new honeymoon at the last minute.  We  stayed at the Hampton Inn as described in Itinerary 16, which is just a  block and a half from the French Quarter.  Thursday morning we took the  excellent Cemetery and Voodoo walking tour found in Itinerary 6.  That  afternoon we had our own perfumes and colognes created for us at Bourbon  French Parfums (Itinerary 3).  Friday we attempted to follow Day Two of  Itinerary 16.  The Zoo is gorgeous and very romantic, but don't get fooled  into taking the timeshare tour that they will offer you at the harbor where  you get your zoo\aquarium tickets.  Saturday we stayed at the Victoria Inn  from Itinerary 27.  What a great place!  It's beautiful and moderately  priced.  The Bayou boat tour (also Itinerary 27) was the highlight of the  trip.  We got to see dolphins swimming right along the boat!  That night's  dinner at Restaurant Des Familles was very good too.  All of these ideas  came from this book and helped make our honeymoon a romantic and memorable  one.  If you ever plan on going to New Orleans, or returning, this is the  book to have.	2000-07-25

This book is not great literature.  But is it supposed to be?  All that it is trying  to do is be entertaining.  On that level alone, it succeeds.  Both the plot  and characters are interesting enough to keep you turning the pages and  wanting to know what will happen next.  So the dialogue is a little silly  at times.  So what?   It's fun and it's entertaining.  Just enjoy the  diversion the book provides.      The only thing that bothered me about the  book is that it is based on false doctrine.  I know the book is fiction,  but it is based on what the authors think might actually happen.   Unfortanately, they are way off.  The Bible does not describe a 7-year  tribulation period or a rapture as it is presented in this book.  If you  really want to learn about the return of Jesus, open up your Bible.  God  tells us Jesus is coming back once - to take those who believe to heaven  and send the others to hell.  are YOU ready?  No second chances.         As  theology and great literature, this book isn't much.  As entertaining  Science Fiction, it's worth a read.	2000-07-12
