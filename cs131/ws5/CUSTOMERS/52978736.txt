Remember \\"Hollywood Shuffle\\", Robert Townsend's send-up of Tinsel Town's ghettoization of black actors/actresses?  Well, this book does much the same thing to the publishing business, except that Everett wields a rapier with a velvet glove.  Not to be missed; superb in every way.	2005-03-09

This story is as much a sociological history of America as it is the story of one incredible man's life.  I can't wait to see the PBS production of this.  The soundtrack for the production, scored and performed by Wynton Marsalis, perfectly captures the time and mood of turn-of-the-century America.  All in, a real triumph.	2005-01-13

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	3	28	65	N	N	Analysis is off the mark; it's the GOP &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;	Thomas Frank correctly describes the end-result, but he misses the real driver, which is race in America. Every national election since 1968 has been a sub rosa referendum on race, with the GOP serving up the toxic brew of fear, bigotry, nostalgia and rank resentment to the unthinking masses in the &quot;Solid South&quot; and in the Great Plains states. As long as Republicans can convince these folks that they must stand with the elite against the aspirations of African-Americans and other citizens of color (in a word, that they are &quot;better&quot;), then these foolish working-class whites will repeatedly find themselves seduced and abandoned. It is no accident that Ronald Reagan kicked off his re-election campaign in 1984 in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where twenty years earlier three young civil rights workers were brutally murdered. There Reagan gave a speech that stridently extolled &quot;states' rights&quot; -a code for the continued subjugation of blacks. And in the 2000 election, this was the reason for Al Gore's losing his home state of Tennessee. The lack of critical thinking by those who continue to vote against their own interests is frequently pointed out by Michael Moore, who drives the right wing to hysteria. Mr. Frank provides an interesting and very readable book, but the underlying causes which he misses are right before our eyes.	2004-08-01

But the plotline is most troubling.  A promising young man  - who has recently graduated with first-class honors from Cambridge - of humble origin is sent to prison on the unsupported and false testimony of a hyperimaginative 13 year old girl?  McEwan doesn't even allude to the trial, which could have been a fabulous opening for some real drama.  And Cecelia, the thwarted older sister who suspects the truth, stands mutely by and allows this to happen to her lover, after her own privacy has been monstrously violated and she has been grievously wronged?  Instead of dragging Briony into an empty room and slapping the truth out of her?  And what kind of ludicrous police investigation would allow such an injustice?  Didn't the accused have a solicitor at trial?  Is this merely class bigotry writ large?  Not in 1935.  All of these issues are problematic.  The middle section of the book, concerning the BEF evacuation at Dunkirk, is much too long and overdone, a digression from the central theme.  And the conclusion is intellectually dishonest and unsatisfying after such a build-up.  In the end, there's no atonement at all, which makes the title a misnomer.	2004-04-20

Notwithstanding the transcendently ignorant reviews previously posted to this site, Mr. Robinson reprises his role of seeker and speaker of the truth.  Too many Americans are trapped in a history that they neither understand, nor desire to understand.  The America they think they know bears no resemblance to the America with which the rest of the world  - and both African-Americans and Native Americans - are painfully familiar.  Robinson writes with power and passion, and with the confidence that the facts support his vision.  This is a most illuminating work, a must-read for anyone who desires to confriont the plain truth of American history, minus the usual sugar-coating and rosy apocryphal.	2004-02-10

Ms. Dickerson did not live in a vacuum; she did not get to the Harvard Law School entirely on her own, as she seems to believe.  More than anything, her message reflects either a brazen dishonesty or a transcendent ignorance of the historic, economic, political and social forces that shaped this country and the destiny of black Americans.  This is a book that could have been written by Dinesh D'Souza, Shelby Steele, Thomas Sowell, or any one of a dozen other race hustlers.  It is a foolish waste of trees.	2004-01-26

Unfortunately, his ignorance of that history and its significance literally leaps off every page.  One previous reviewer absolutely nailed it: But for the liberals and civil rights groups who forced an end to racist US immigration policies by the passage of the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, D'Souza probably wouldn't be in this country.

Some critics attempt to minimize the message by  blathering about native Americans, but this does not ameliorate or soften  Mr. Robinson's powerful arguments, nor does it detract from his message:  That until America does the right and just thing with respect to the  enormous debt owed to African Americans, there will be no peace.  One  critic laments the truth that is told about Washington and Jefferson,  primarily because these mythical &quot;heroes&quot; are viewed as godlike,  beyond reproach, a &quot;product of their time&quot; and thereby exempt  from hypocrisy and intellectual dishonesty.  The great Samuel Johnson, a  contemporary of theirs, had this to say about them: &quot;How curious it is  that those who bray loudest about liberty are themselves the drivers of  slaves.&quot;  Mr. Robinson is an unabashed seeker and speaker of the  truth, and should be celebrated for his courage and honesty.

The authors of this book explore the reality-versus-image dichotomy more analytically than any other work I've  read.  And they're right on the money with respect to affirmative action,  which was developed as a counter-weight to racism, and those critics who  declare that it gives rise to white resentment. This position is akin to  using an experimental treatment for cancer, and then declaring that the  treatment CAUSED the cancer.  It is well settled that there was white  resentment long before the words &quot;affirmative&quot; and  &quot;action&quot; were ever used in the same sentence.

Shelby Steele was an obscure professor of english with second-rate credentials at a third-rate institution. He had done nothing of consequence in his field of scholarship, but obviously decided that playing the &quot;racial blame game&quot; was his ticket to a measure of fame. Saving his harshest criticism for the black underclass, Steele conveniently ignores the continuing crime of the first-instance: racism. Racial charlatans, from the Al Sharptons and Jesse Jacksons on the left, to the Shelby Steeles and Thomas Sowells on the right, have found great profit in this sophisticated hustle. And Steele is yet another academic who seems to believe that the real world operates with all the civility and politesse of the campus.

Reginald McKnight's latest collection of short stories is a disappointment. Although McKnight, a capable writer, is working with some very promising themes here, he frequently fails to deliver after using dramatic tension to build to a climax. There is a small-stakes, sometimes muddled, quality about the messages he seeks to convey, which leaves the reader with dashed expectations after having plowed through so much narrative.  Additionally, those stories written in the first-person all seem to speak with the same voice, injecting a disingenuous note. The sole exception is the final story, from which the collection takes its name, and in which McKnight paints a brilliant portrait of nascent bigotry and its various impacts.  The high-water mark for black-oriented short fiction remains James Alan McPherson's timeless collection of short stories, Elbow Room, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1978 and is back in print.  It can be ordered through Amazon Online, and is highly recommended.	1997-12-22

There is huge irony in the hyperbole here, and the lack of a moral centerpoint serves to drive this work to its inexorable conclusion. A superbly written, spellbinding read.

US	52978736	R2606MP532U6QO	014023716X	8734996	Volunteer Slavery: My Authentic Negro Experience	Books	5	4	10	N	N	Superb. Brutally honest, well written, eloquent.	Jill Nelson frontally attacks the denial, dishonesty and hypocrisy surrounding the issue of race in the corporate suites.  She will clearly make some people uncomfortable, which is precisely the point of this memoir.  Nelson is a seasoned, talented writer who has the guts to step out of racial orthodoxy (read: black accomodation of racism) in order to illuminate that which deafens white people and suffocates black people.  A fascinating, evocative account, not to be missed	1997-08-21
US	52978736	R2ZWP852EZ8ZQ5	0399142622	2832661	Straight, No Chaser	Books	5	2	6	N	N	Excellent. A much-needed jolt of plain-spoken truth.	Jill Nelson does not mince words, which is so refreshing in light of publishing's overly-censorious political correctness, especially in matters of race relations.  Nelson is both a seeker and a speaker of the unvarnished truth, an act viewed as practically seditious, especially when one considers the enforced marginalization of black writers who depart from the polite yet utterly dishonest orthodoxy.  If Jill Nelson's writing were put to music, it would sound like John Coltrane wailing on a solo. But for courageous people like Jill Nelson, many white people would continue thinking that most black people are fools. Too many white people shake their heads in amazement at the racial fault lines exposed by the O.J. Simpson verdict, then attack a Jill Nelson when she explains it all for them.  Go on, girl	1997-08-20

This one is a cult classic, a story with messages that resonate long after we've put it down.  One of my three or four all-time favorites. Brown has the gift of the storyteller's ear and voice, and an instinctive feel for the trope and rhythm of language.  If it were put to music, it would be a combination of Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane.  A cover-to-cover &quot;bright moment&quot;	1997-08-08
