I thought \\"American Gods\\" was a terrific book, but this sequel is much funnier, cleverer, and more imaginative. Gaiman takes his Anansi character and \\"kills\\" him off (although we know you really can never kill a god), leaving his sons to live up to his trickser legacy. Along the way, he skewers the London lifestyle, little old ladies in Miami, international money launderers and anything else he can think up. He also sets up a couple clever romances and turns a milktoast accountant (one of Anansi's sons) into a demi-god who can stand on his own two feet.<br /><br />Readers should be warned that this is contemporary fantasy, which means anything can happen, logical or not. So, if the idea of venegeful ghosts and invisible tiger gods bother you, don't pick up the book and expect it to make logical sense.<br /><br />Gaiman has a brilliant, creative mind and creates a world that's a delight to visit.	2005-10-03

I've been a fan of Sara Paretsky's ever since the first V.I. Warshawsky book came out. \\"Fire Sale\\" is certainly a fine mystery and it had me reading into the wee hours of the morning. The plot is carefully crafted and the ending is not something telegraphed at the beginning of the book. I even found myself suspecting someone who turned out to be innocent, which is the sign of a great red herring.<br /><br />However, I must say that I was bothered by the fact that she starts with a jarring scene and then takes about 50 pages of flashback to explain what Warshawsky was doing there. I never found the lover, Morrell, to be anything but a sketch of a character. And, most problematic, the villains are simply villains through and through. There is no sense that they have complex characters--they are simply racist, hypocritical fat cats. And that bothers me, because there's nothing like a multi-faceted villain to make a mystery shine.<br /><br />This is a good read, but certainly nothing like \\"Blacklist,\\" Paretsky's last mystery, which was very fine indeed.	2005-09-22

I consider myself pretty informed about political and social topics, yet I had little idea that Title IX does not just cover equality in sporting opportunities. Title IX, the brainchild of late Congresswoman Edith Green, actually mandates that schools may not limit the educational opportunities of students based on gender--and that includes admissions policies and access to classes. Title IX is the reason that half of all law students and medical students today are women.<br /><br />What a huge change from the early 1960s, the era in which Blumenthal opens the book with a description of swimmer Donna De Verona. The 13-year-old swimmer, long denied opportunities to participate in other sports she loved, finally decided to become a swimmer. Not only did she excel, but she became the most decorated high school swimmer in the United States. She won two Olympic gold medals and the adoration of the press. Then she graduated, and...nothing. No scholarships, no endorsements, no interest. Here was an 18-year-old brimming with talent and she hit a dead end because there simply were no rewards for women athletes.<br /><br />At the time De Verona was facing her bleak future, women all over the country were confounded by colleges that had strict admissions quotas. Many schools refused to enroll women in science and math classes. And legislators could get away with citing the need for \\"delicate\\" females to leave educational spaces open for men, who would be the \\"breadwinners.\\"<br /><br />Things changed, and they changed quickly. A little too quickly for institutions such as Harvard University, which comes off poorly in this book. These stodgy and hidebound schools tried their hardest to keep women from upsetting their little alumni-donation applecart (women alumni were said not to give money to the colleges). Coaches went ballistic when they realized they'd have to share space and dollars with female athletes. And shrill voices predicted shared locker rooms and the end of the feminine mystique.<br /><br />But then came Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs and the famous \\"Battle of the Sexes\\" tennis match. It captured the imagination of the nation and a generation was galvanized to not allow women second-class status any longer.<br /><br />Now, here we are in 2005 and the world has changed for the better. Title IX is still controversial with football coaches and a few other macho types who'd like all the money and attention focused on men. But America has taken to female soccer players (Mia Hamm), tennis favorites (the Williams sisters), basketball players (too many to mention) and also with female doctors and lawyers. It's all part of the current cultural landscape and there's no going back.<br /><br />Blumenthal does a great job bringing the law to life by providing mamny break-out boxes with stories of female athletes and legislators that made a difference. Would you believe Caspar Weinberger, Richard Nixon's conservative head of the old department of Health, Education and Welfare, was instrumental in getting Title IX signed and implemented? Can you believe that Nixon signed it? All these stories are true and come to vivid life in Blumenthal's straightforward style of storytelling.<br /><br />She doesn't pull any punches and she shouldn't have to. What was unfair needed to be rectified. Today's kids who are growing up in a nearly egalitarian society need to know that they are standing on the shoulders of some pretty courageous and forward-thinking human beings.<br /><br />I recommend that if you have a daughter, niece, grandchild, little sister, or just that cute neighbor girl down the street, this book would make an excellent addition to her library.eir little alumni-donation applecart (women alumni were said not to give money to the colleges).

But this one, \\"The Ice Queen,\\" is so unlike the others that I can hardly believe she wrote it. She deliberately chooses a rude, self-centered and irritating narrator who doesn't deserve the good treatment she gets from the people around her. The prose style is blunted with ugly sentence fragments just sitting there.<br /><br />What happened to the lyrical prose, the word paintings that Hoffman is famous for? I also missed the magic that mark her as a contemporary magical realist. Even the tempering effect on her character by novel's end doesn't ring true. If it weren't for certain interesting ideas and odd moments of revelation, I'd call this a dud. Certainly, I consider this far below her usual standards.	2005-05-29

Because this book is about a code also, it looked like a good bet to capture the same audience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book is mess. Essentially, it's nothing more than a knowledge core dump by a couple Ivy Leaguers who are eager to show what they learned in college. In the tangle of all the unrelated facts and gee-whiz philosophical arguments is the riddle of a book with Renaissance secrets. Some of the riddles are so ridiculously easy to figure out that I winced as I read on. Others are better constructed, but nothing is particularly convincing.<br /><br />Stylistically, the book just murders the device of present-tense story telling by diving into whole chapters of past-tense backstory. Hey, take a look at William Gibson's \\"Pattern Recognition.\\" He uses the technique correctly by continuing to move the action forward.<br /><br />The love story is hopelessly constructed and the ending doesn't really come to any conclusions whatsoever. The reader has to guess how the puzzle was solved and the fate of one of crucial characters is never explained adequately.<br /><br />I'd give the book one star if it weren't for the fact that the writers stumbled on a good idea. Had they acquired the kind of editor who could make their prose shine, they had a crack at creating a winner.	2005-04-28

Baker takes a few ideas from the 12-step programs, a few ideas from zen philosophy, and a little New Age thinking and comes up with something that is neither new nor Earth-shattering. He even contradicts himself many times. Over and over he counsels readers that it takes pain to make the good times feel good, which is wise advice. Then he quotes Nietzsche's \\"What doesn't kill me makes me stronger,\\" and calls it stupid! Old Friedrich said the same thing as Baker does, only in stronger language.<br /><br />Baker also goes on and on about the joy of possibilities, which is also good advice. Then he slams the \\"create your own reality\\" theory, which is about...choosing possiblities. Once again, same concept, different wording.<br /><br />I don't know. I'm sure to get slammed on this review, because it seems that Baker is writing what people want to hear.

Sporting a black cover and numbering more than 700 pages, it looks awfully forbidding, especially to someone who doesn't relish the idea of taking weeks to read a book.<br /><br />My advice: do it. There hasn't been a book since last year's \\"Pattern Recognition\\" By William Gibson that has been so totally absorbing for me. Author Susanna Clarke creates an entire world in those 700-some pages. And like all great fantasy writers, her magical world follows rules of its own that are oddly similar to, but not quite the same as, those of our real one. Or is her world the real one? By the time you finish reading, you might begin to wonder.<br /><br />As one who spend a week and a half inhabiting the universe of magicians Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, I was simply swept away by the exhilarting language, the lovingly created characters and the deliberately old-fashioned spellings. The book is designed to look as if it has been published in the early 19th century, and it's written with an omnisicient narrator who, curiously, seems like a character on his/her own. There even are a few instances in which the narrator says \\"I did such and such,\\" but we never find out who \\"I\\" is. The style, although touted as similar to Jane Austen in the jacket blurbs, is more like Thackeray with its wry humor and tongue-in-cheek view of English society.<br /><br />But it's the main characters who command the attention, and you are unlikely to meet figures who are as fascinating as the two magicians, Strange and Norell. And when I say magicians, I'm not speaking of the pull-the-rabbit-out-of the-hat variety. These are the real deals: magicians who can turn the rain into a vision of a British ship of the line or transport whole towns at will. Crazy? Maybe so, but you have to willingly submit to Clarke's logic for the drama to unfold. In this world, magic is real.<br /><br />The plot turns on an odd falling out between the two magicians and the mysterious disappearance of Strange's beloved wife, Arabella. There are tangles with fairies, trips to enchanted netherworlds, and a prolonged section in Venice, in which Strange flirts with madness to have his wife returned to him.<br /><br />It's all beautifully crafted, right down to the fake footnotes referencing phony books. The result is a book that almost makes you believe that the Duke of Wellington employed a magician to help him win the Napoleonic Wars.<br /><br />\\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" is a beautiful trip to a world the reader is sorry to leave, Much in the tradition of J.R.R.

The lead character Barney is much more macha than Stephanie and has spent time car racing, fixing engines, kickboxing and other unsual things. So, when the Cuban mafia is on her trail, she's a lethal weapon that they can't control.<br /><br />I rather prefer Stephanie's more feminine way of getting things done, but Barney is a hoot, especially when she joins forces with her gay friend Judey. The romantic lead, Hooker, spends most of his time being a narcissistic jerk, so it's a little hard to accept his sudden heroism. And some of the coincidences and rescues remind me of the cavalry coming around the corner--a little too neat to be believed.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed the change of scenery and the witty dialog. Evanovich is a master at getting how people really speak, a feat that's a lot harder than it looks.	2005-02-18

I vowed after reading that one that I'd have to start with No 1 and read my way up the list. The first novel, ONE FOR THE MONEY, is a wild, mapcap adventure with Stephanie just learning her craft, hurling herself into trouble with the cop Morelli (whom she just hates to love), and bungling  her way into a really blood-curdling duel with a psycho killer. The joy of Evanovich's writing is that it all looks effortless, although we all know she put plenty of art into it.<br /><br />Looking forward to number two, just as soon as Amazon delivers it.	2005-01-09

Not only is the author hilariously funny, but his view of the world of journalism is dead on target. As a reporter myself, I was amazed at how well Hiaasen describes the office politics, the infighting, the incompetence, and the odd love/hate relationship that journalists have with their profession.<br /><br />The mystery is a good one, although fairly easy to figure out, but it's the method in which he tells it that makes \\"Basket Case\\" worth reading. He creates a vivid portrait of the current rock scene, and leaves a bit of nostalgia for the rock 'n' rollers of days gone by.<br /><br />Read it when you're down; it's bound to pick you and get you laughing.	2004-12-18

Arthur Phillips pulls off the rather antique style of novel construction in vivid style, using journal entries, letters, and telegrams. While the mystery that is at the heart of this book is easy to figure out, what is more interesting is what drives the main character, the reputed Ralph Trilipush. He's clearly an unreliable narrator, capable of lying through his teeth while charming the ladies. Yet, there's something deep and and needy to his quest and he's hardly the con man that Aussie P.I. Ferrell--who's on his trail--imagines. I found myself caught up in the horror of the frenzied last half of the book, not wanting to read on but unable to put the book down.<br />  To those who look at this book as a mere mystery, it's bound to be a disappointment. I found many gaps in logic and the ending is clearly unbelievable--for how was Trilipush supposed to have written those last lines of his journal? His injury should have killed him within days. There's never enough of Ferrell's letters, which are the most entertaining of the entire book.<br />  The ending letters, while supposedly explanatory, never really fill the reader in on Trilipush's relationship with key figures. It leaves one to guess.<br />  However, as a work of pure artistic construction, the book is brilliantly done. I only would have recommended a heavy-handed editor to axe the flowery pages where Trilipush goes on about his grand plans too often.<br />  It's hard to say if I'd recommend this book to just anyone. It's fine reading for a fan of offbeat literature, but downright disappointing to a mystery buff.	2004-11-24

I had to admit that Hamilton pulled me into her fantasy world almost immediately, and I never read any of the Anita Blake novels. A number of people have objected to the sex in this novel, but I found it quite well done. Writing sexual scenes is probably one of the scariest things a writer can do. Use one clich&eacute;, one over-charged word, and the whole thing becomes ludicrous. These descriptions are exciting without being over-the-top.<br /><br />That said, I think she spends a little too much time on the sexual energy of the situations and darn little on the actual mystery at hand. I enjoyed the trip to the sidhe home court and the political machinations, but never really understood what happened with the case they left behind at the Gray Detective Agency.<br /><br />I also read the second book in this series and felt that it had more story and a little more depth. Here's hoping the new series will continue to pick up in style and polish.	2004-08-24

Point of View? All over the place. Character development? Fragmented and ultimately pointless. Really, Marcelle Clements has done little more than throw a bunch of characters together, have them tease each other sexually (but never really do anything about it) and then take them home to New York. I'd love to know what the point was to the whole thing--just as I'd like to know why the poor puppy was killed at the beginning of the book. If that was a portent, it didn't work. (I don't think I'm ruining anything for readers to reveal this minor point.) Someone else pointed out that the 24-year-old Billy was constantly treated as a child in this book, a point that I found extremely irritating. All the other characters (except for the Lolita-like au pair) are boring Baby Boomers who have forgotten what romance is all about.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Midsummer\\" is a time waster.

With roots in the days of McCarthy-era blacklisting, the evil plot that Warshawski must unfold takes place in the wealthy estates that Chicagoans will recognize as Barrington  (and parts beyond.) Most of the time Warshawski is sleuthing around dirty old tenements, so this is a surprising change of pace.<br />In order to solve the murder of an enterprising black reporter, Warshawski has to jump through numerous hoops, most thrown up by rich folks who don't want the status quo broken. She does so in masterful style (although my bones ached for all her injuries). The end ties up cleanly, albeit sadly.<br />This is a great read with throught-provoking questions about privacy and privilege tossed in along the way.

I'm tempted to call it the novel of the year, but 2004 has hardly begun.<br />  Niffenegger takes what could have been a prosaic contemporary slice-of-life and gives it vigor and pizzazz by making the male protagonist a time traveler. It's not a magic trick he does for fun--it's grueling, horrible, and leaves him naked and pennilesss for hours or days at at time. Eventually he learns to pick locks, steal clothes and somehow put up with his &quot;illness,&quot; but he doesn't turn into the kind of man you'd want to meet in a dark alley, either.<br />  Then, in his chronology, he meets Clare, a beautiful young artist. He follows her growing-up period and falls deeply in love. By the time they meet in real time, Clare has taught Henry how to be human and their love story is as magnificent as it is painful.<br />  By the end of the book, Henry has changed so much, become so kind and caring that we forgive his past, and mourn for Clare when she eventually loses her soul mate--that is, if anyone can lose anyone in a time-traveling world. This is a book I shall treasure always.<br />  One extra note: as a Chicagoan, I had great fun identifying all the places where Henry and Clare hang out. The author creates an powerful sense of place that keeps the love story grounded in the reality of a 21st century city.	2004-03-04

She insists that our positive or negative feelings create the reality we live in. While I don't think this is typical &quot;blame-the-victim&quot; mentality, it is a difficult concept for people to swallow. Did everyone at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon create their death scenario on Sept. 11th, 2001? I don't think so. But there is some karmic truth to what she says as it pertains to everyday life.<br />The information on positive thoughts is quite powerful. Her methodology does work, although it's extremely difficult to keep the practice of postive feelings going all day long. I need to refer to this book often to remember to stay positive.<br />I'd have given the book five stars, had it not been for irritating repetition of the word &quot;feeeeelings&quot; throughout the book. We get the message in the first few pages, but Grabhorn insists on repeating this word until your back teeth begin to grind. (And then that song of the same name starts playing in your head. Aghhhh.)

After reading the Take off Your Blinders review by a conservative, I feel even better about Al Franken's amazing book. No only is it extremely well researched (down to transcripts of television broadcasts), but the points he makes are unavoidable. Before W. were living in peacetime, there was an anti-terrorism plan in place, civil liberties weren't at risk, and we had a surplus. And now, our young people are coming home in caskets, we are stuck in a mess in Iraq, the world hates us, and we're supposed to pay $87 billion to get out of it.<br />My dad, a lifelong Republican, said &quot;we've got to get this guy out of there,&quot; referring to Bush. To him (and to the Blinders reviewer), conservatism has nothing at all to do with running up huge deficits and wanton spending (such as $8,000 for Ashcroft's curtain). He also points out that we won in Kosovo without losing one American life.<br />Franken is right on all counts, but he makes you laugh while you are pounding the armrest in anger. If he's done anything good this year, Franken has motivated a lot of people to get out and do something about this disaster we are in now.<br />Fantastic work.

So, that's why LILY'S Ghosts stands out. There's plenty more than a ghost story going on here. A young girl has been dragged all over the U.S. by her slightly ditzy single mother, Arden. As soon as a boyfriend disappears from Arden's love life, Ruby's entire life is disrupted again. Being the only new kid in class is becoming familiar to the poor pre-teen.<br />But when she enters the creepy house in Cape May, NJ, Ruby has a whole new set of problems. Ghosts, and plenty of them, are determined to keep a secret--unviolated by mere mortals--to the very end. A little detective work and some harmeless flirtation keep the story moving at a rapid clip.<br />Ruby's writing technique is refined and she shows her flair with fascinating passages from the viewpoint of the ghosts themselves.

Subsequent books have ranged from disturbing to unfulfilling, as she tackled such powerful themes as spousal abuse, hazing and identity change.<br />But this book returns her to the genre that suits her best: magical realism. The wonderful book spins the tale of a family of magical women, who pass psychic gifts from generation to generation. It's up the the latest of the Sparrow women, a rebellious teenager, to trace the disturbing history of this haunted family. Meanwhile, her mother, unhappily married and attempting to turn her back on the Sparrow gifts, learns from her daughter the terrible truth of the original Sparrow &quot;witch.&quot;<br />It's glorious reading and done in the lush style that Hoffman wears like a kid glove. Any Hoffman fan who has been disappointed in recent years will love this book, as will newcomers to Hoffman's work.	2003-10-24

Brilliantly excecuted in the style of high-style thriller, William Gibson's novel examines the frightened new world of post-Sept. 11th Western culture. Cayce (named after the famed psychic, but pronounce &quot;case&quot;) is easily his most memorable protagonist. A woman with a prounounced sensitivity to labels and marketing gimmicks, she is a professional Cool Hunter, on the lookout for the next trend.<br />But she also is haunted by the memory of a father who never returned from downtown Manhattan on Sept. 11th. Traveling from London to Toyyo to Moscow and back, Cayce feels her soul trailing behind her as she follows the coolest of cool, a series of films played out of sync on the Internet, and spelling out some sort of story that the world can only guess at. What she learns is less important than what she picks up along the way, a pronounced sensation of the world in flux, where no one can be trusted, and terrorism can even be found in objects of fashion.<br />This is the only Gibson novel that takes place entirely within the present, which rules out his usual sci-fi label. With PATTERN RECOGNITION, Gibson writes the literary/mainstream novel that contends with the best of the competion.	2003-10-24

Harrar's protagonist, Evan Birch, is a largely unlikeable character who is the only philosophy professor left at his university. Although a devoted family man and someone preoccupied with distributing his own book on a German philosopher, Birch finds himself suddenly suspected of kidnapping a teenager girl.<br />Memory becomes confusing. Odd images surface. Lectures become questions into the what Evan really believes about life. In perhaps the most telling of Harrar's scenes, the professor is forced to teach a &quot;Philosophy of Time&quot; class that no one in physics wants to teach. Completely adrift, he rambles on about time in a Newtonian way, completely ignorant of the new discoveries of quantum physics. Trapped in a linear way of thinking, Evan can't find his way out of his own predicament until he lets dreams, intuition and difffernet views of the past begin to surface, shedding new light on the crime.<br />Along the way, the reader begins to sympathize with his plight, although Birch always remains a man who's spinning in a reality he can't understand. An excellent novel.	2003-08-25

However, Schoch is not much of a writer, and even with a co-author, this book is about as exciting as your college physics textbook. The problem is over-research. I get the feeling the Schoch is so used to writing academic papers that he feels that every single fact must be documented and footnoted. In the popular press, the reader is willing to go along with some ideas as long as they are documented now and then.<br />Once you get past the format, it's not hard to apprehend Schoch's primary theme. He believes that the pyramid structure has not popped up all over the globe by accident, but that ancient mariners brought the ideas with them. He won't date the time of this migration, but it sounds quite a bit like an Atlantean diffusion. Schoch finds pyramids in China, India, Africa, the Mid-east and the Americas. There also are the mounds in North America.<br /> Schoch is convinced that the American pyramids came from China, although his reasoning here is not easy to follow. When even the Mayan legends themselves speak of settlers from the East, Schoch opines that the settlers actually came across the Pacific and worked their way east to the Yucatan. This I find completely unbelievable, especially in light of the underwater findings that have been sighted near Cuba. Clearly the migration was from east to west. Another problem is that Schoch sees pyramids where I can only make out conical towers. He claims that many Indonesian structures are pyramids, but they don't even resemble the stepped or triangular structures to me.<br />His last chapter refutes those who refute his Sphinx dating. It's dry in the extreme, but he certainly has the academic goods on his detractors. As a skilled geologist, he can easily rebuff Egyptologist Mark Lehner's absurb peeling and scaling theory.<br />This is a book to skim. It drags where it should inspire and reiterates what we already know. As for ancient boat migration, all he had to do was refer to Thor Heyerdahl's Ra and Kon-Tiki experiments. There's some good information here, but much of it is material you'll want to skip.s a book to skim. It drags where it should inspire and reiterates what we already know.

Pagel's newest work,BEYOND BELIEF, promises to take up where her excellent GNOSTIC GOSPELS takes off, but it doesn't even begin to seriously study the gnostic tradition. Instead, it is a lengthy comparison of the Gospel of Thomas (briefly referenced)and the Gospel of John (quoted far too for often). Essentially, it ends up being a history how one bishop and Emperor Constantine designed what our current Bible would look like, expurgating anything that was remotely unorthodox.<br />This in itself is powerful material, but Pagels writes from such a scholarly distance that it's hard to really become emotionally invested in the material. If the the Gnostic gospels, especially that of Thomas, were so explosive, why were they banned? And why did some unnamed soul feel compelled to hide them in a cave in Nag Hammadi?<br />Someone has mentioned that Pagels is trying to deconstruct Christianity, and nothing could be farther from the truth. There is nothing wrong with trying to find out what the original Christians believed, what was left out for political purposes, and how we may regain the essence of what Christ taught. It is also essential to understand why the Paulines succeeded when Peter's largely Jewish contingent did not. The gnostic idea that the divine is within all of us (once a heretical thought) is now accepted at some of the most mainstream churches. As society changes, so does much of the church.<br />But Pagels stumbles when she spends most of her time retelling old history and not explaining exactly what the Gospel of Thomas reveals to a new millennium.<br />I'd suggest sitting down with a copy of \\"The Lost Bible\\" or other accounts of the Apocryphia and draw your own conclusions.	2003-06-27

Although I'm a female who grew up pre-Title IX, I thought I could learn how to compete, but it just wasn't happening. No matter how much I learned about form and strategy, when it came to game time, I'd lose.<br />This book has helped explain what's going on in my head and what I can do to either win or just plain enjoy tennis for fun. It's going to take some time to put Braden's tips to use, but his common-sense approach simple to understand and the data he uses to back it up convinces even the skeptics.<br />Here's one tidbit that makes sense: get back one more ball, and you'll up your game-wining percentage by 33 percent. That's an amazing number and I find myself diving for balls now that I ordinarily consider hopeless.

For the most part, you do get a bit of factual information that's intriguing enough to get you thinking.<br />But the breathless pace of the plot is simply made-for-TV. There's not a moment to pause and really see into the characters. Each chapter is about three pages long and ends with some tantalizing little bit that reminds me of a blackout before a commercial.<br />The code itself is sometimes dazzling and sometimes impossibly obvious. There were times I had to snap the book shut in disgust because the supposedly brilliant protagonist couldn't solve a basic riddle or recognize Da Vinci's famous mirror writing. And frankly, Da Vinci really has not much at all to do with the plot.<br />One would think that a thriller directed at an educated audience would be written with a little more care, more realistic dialogue and a hint of verisimilitude. I really couldn't believe any of the bold escape plans. Plus, for a book so focused on female spirituality, why is the Sophie character so distant and never allowed to show her own sexual side?<br />It's not a total disappointment, but I found myself let down by the final pages. This book could have been brilliant. It's just average.	2003-06-03

While there is not doubt that the early Christians were nothing like the Roman Catholic church of today, it's hard to convince this reader that the entire cult was based on a gnostic myth.<br />  At the heart of this book, the writers try to display (as in their earlier writings) that Jesus never existed. The gnostics just imagined his story, and egged on by Paul, who never met the historic Jesus, they spread their story world-wide. And then the literatists turned myth into history.<br />  It's hard to grapple with. While their description of the gnostics is wonderful and their slight brush with the goddess Sophia (who became the Virgin Mary as an object for veneration in the traditional church), the essential theme remains suspect.<br />Writers with better reasoning powers and closer readings of Jewish midrash and Gospel research (Spong and Pagels) have shown that the first Christians were both gnostic *and* that Jesus was a real person. They also point out theat another branch of original Christians, led by Jesus' brother James, practiced a highly Jewish form of Christianity, keeping the laws and demanding circumcision. If Jesus were just a myth, why would this cul even have come into existence?<br />  When it comes right down to it, Freke's and Gandy's view is skewed, but makes some interesting reading. It just isn't convincing.	2003-04-20

Every time we pick up a cell phone when the car breaks down, pop an aspirin for a lingering fever, open a bottle of sports water, answer another telemarketing phone call, readers remember life in Appalachia in the early part of the 20th century. This was truly a world apart. No phones, no instant meals, not even a bookshelf of books to read.<br />  The world of this book is so deeply rooted in the past that when the Spanish Flu breaks out after World War I, the doctor arrives at one house with a mysterious powder--a wonder drug developed by Germans. It's aspirin, and it saves a character's life.<br />  In this remote world, we encounter Elizabeth Whitely, a girl who never knew her father, and who follow her mother along \\"birthing babies.\\" In an era when doctors were too remote and difficult interest in a birth, midwives were an essential part of life. The herbs, the twisti,g of tiny bodies in wombs, the signs of miscarriage, are all part of Elizabeth's young life, which she assumes will soon be hers.<br />  Then one day she uncovers the dirty little secret of midwives. Not everone wants their baby. And in an ironic look at the anti-abortion hysteria going on today, the wealthiest and most pious-looking clients look aside at such a shocking crime as infanticide. \\"We don't want her,\\" says one mother and the midwife has no choice but to smother the baby or let it die a more brutal death.<br />  Then there are the abortions or \\"knocking free\\" a baby with herbs. This is a simple, but possibly risky, treatment that so-called unschooled people have been doing for thousands of years. And I'm assured than in today's Belize, the jungle people practice it still. No marches, no banners, just a private abortion that no one discusses.<br />  Elizabeth isn't sure she wants any part of such an amoral world and does her best to avoid midwifery, which she never really does. Rebellious and often contrary to the end, she makes poor choices in her love life. But she is blessed in another way. Her stepdaugther--a \\"Miracle Baby\\" who should have died--becomes a healer and goes through her life re-affirming Elizabeth's own doubt that life and love are worth the struggle<br />  The end is predictable, probably, but in its own way, this is the only kind of ending this books could have. Life meets the modern world head on, and ready or not, it must join the age we know.<br />  Kudos to Laskas who writes of an area she knows and loves. If the language sounds odd to an urbanite, it's true to the soul of West Virginia.

Most of the time, it figured I was just getting too much information--both legal and forensic. But Turow has grown into a mature author who knows how to blend his legal knowledge with solid ficition writing.<br />This book is particularly interesting in light of the fact that Turow is one of the lawyers who fought tirelessly to free a convicted murder in Illinois who was sentenced to died, even though another man admitted to the crime and had a perfect DNA match. He uses the real-life local squabbling and legal manueveriing to create a story that rings with believablilty.<br />His characters are extemely good, especially the country prosecutor who's a tiny dynamo--fair on the court and unthinking in her love life. The defense attorney stuck defending a man on death row, Arthur Raven, comes across as Turow on a blue day. (All his heroes seem to be version of himself.) But the supporting cast is terrific the dumb-as-a-boulder condemned man to the conniving monster who really did the crime.<br />My only objections are, once again too much information of fingerprint analysis (I skipped a lot of that) and bit of an abrupt ending. And, heck, I know a lot of courthouse reporters and none of them are the vipers that Turow protrays.<br />But three cheers for Turow for shedding light on why innocent people end up on death row so often.	2003-03-27

It's bad enough that the book is written by one \\"Richard Powers\\" who suspiciously has a past similar to the author's. But the annoying and self-indulgent pattern of calling characters by single initials (C. for the lover) and of naming obivious locations by initials (B for Boston and U. for Urbana, Illinois) only serves to distance the reader from Powers' work. Are we supposed to take his story seriously, or as some kind of fable he's constructed from his true past? Is there something wrong with calling a town and town?<br />I found his characters fascinating, but best being Artificial Intelligence expert Lentz, a barely human creature who turns out to have a heart of sheer beauty. Others display the human foibles we all love. But C. is a sheer bore and the love story between her and the self-important \\"Powers\\" made me want to skip whole sections of the book.<br />There are far too many authors today determined to prove that they can improve on the simple act of telling a good story. Powers falls into the trap of trying to distance us, create a myth instead of an all-out fictional tale, turn machines into objects of love and desire.<br />The book has wonderful moments of mood and description, but the main character's disturbing ennui and the pathetic non-ending, made me sorry I even spent the time on this novel.

Immediately, I was delighted by the story of a reporter who's hired to make stories up for a sleazy tabloid rag. Here's a smart and funny way of turning the usual newspaper story on its ear: instead of looking for truth, the heroine avoids truth at all costs.<br />Along the way, we meet some fabulous characters: her blossoming pre-teen daughter, her ne-er do well absent hubby, a crazy hippy pal, parents who live to criticize, a love-torn co-worker. It all works well, especially when the Vera the reporter invents a story that turns out to be true. (And don't you love the name? Vera, which means true.)<br />The only reason I give this book three stars instead of five, is that the story complely fizzles out at the end. Fired for telling the truth, Vera goes on a long journey to get her life together, tries to reconnect with her husband, and essentially learns nothing. Unfortuntately, ths is Prose's worst flaw. She simply does not want to end the story, and certainly not in a satisfying way. Only in BLUE ANGEL, does she come to a real, albeit depressing, conclusion.<br />But for the first two-thirds of this book, it's beautifully and observantly written.	2003-02-22

Salmon narrates from \\"her\\" heaven (which Sebold is careful to differentite from any else's idea of heaven). Because of this creative device, the author can see into any mind and any life. This omnisicent viewpoint--once popular, but now out of favor--truly makes the book vibrate with feeling.<br />The characters are beautifully drawn and their reactions believeable. The writing, especially the descriptions of Susie's heaven is so lush and sweet. Susie is never bitter, never vindictive, never judgmental, just an impartial observer on what was too short of a life.<br />Some people feel the description of Susie's death is too grisly, but I found it sensibly succinct, without any lingering on gore or depravity. In fact, I doubt I've ever seen this subject handled better.<br />Tiny gripes: the bad guy is dispatched too cleanly, the cops are way too bungling to be believed, and there are some editing glitches when seasons get mixed up.

However, the essential points were well made and the diving stories were quite good. There's a nifty part where he takes skeptical geologist Wolf Wichmann down to the Yoganumi site and the two have a debate. It's quite well balanced.<br />I'd say this book is great reading for those who don't buy the Antarctica theory of Atlantis. Hancock figures that &quot;Atlantis&quot; was all the miles of shoreline swallowed by the end of the last Ice Age. A thrilling theory and one that really hasn't been explored. But the details! One could get mired in the minutea.<br />I read on his web site the reasons *why* he spent so much time on minute details. (He goes on for about 20 pages on the carbon dating of teeth in Malta. Unbelievable.) He said that &quot;Fingerprints&quot; was written as an book of advocacy, and he immediately was trounced for being one-sided. So this time, he's going to extremes to present the other side. If you ask me, he overdid it. But his critics are pretty vicious, so maybe he's protecting himself this way.<br />The photos by Santha Faiia are good, but I don't understand why the publisher didn't use the ones that are on his web site.

Big political deals are struck, a war veteran goes mad and dies, a young girl is nearly seduced by a missionary of shaky sexual orientation, and Mrs. Dalloway's former lover bursts upon the scene.<br />It's sometimes overpowering, because the sentences can ramble on for pages, but it never takes on that corny stream-of-consciousness style that so much American literature is riddled with. It's always lush and surprisingly rich with details, even when thee obversations are downright nasty.<br />It's easy to see why Michael Cunningham chose this as a basis for his own book, THE HOURS, which features its own tightly interwoven characters. Reading MRS. DALLOWAY will give Cunningham readers a better understanding of what he accomplished with is own stunning novel.	2003-01-10

I had to go to Amazon.uk to find his previous works. Good thing they are now readily availble in the USA.<br />GODS OF EDEN is one of those books that one needs to pick up periodically to mull over. It's nearly impossible to take in all of Collins' theories in one go. But he makes impressive arguments that the Egyptian culture is much older than traditional archeologists will admit. While kicking a bit of dust at the stodgy, old Egyptologists at the British Museum, Collins also deftly avoids the smoke and mirrors of \\"pyramidiots\\" old and new.<br />I admit he loses me a bit when he travels too far afield of Egypt, but I attribute the fault with myself and not with him. The book is copiously footnoted (they make good reading in themselves) and well researched.	2003-01-09

I was so eager to read UNDERWORLD that I sent away to Amazon.uk for it. What I received was an 800-page tome that stirred the mind as well as put me to sleep.<br />To summarize, Hancock theorizes that the end of the Great Ice Age ended with vast areas of precious real estate innundated by seawater. These often were coastal cities settled by civilized members of the Indus, Japanese, Maya and other cultural groups. The theory makes a great deal of sense, especially in light of the amazing findings a Russian submarine research vehicle has been finding off the coast of Cuba. <br />Surely, all combined, the vast, lost areas of Africa, South Ameerica, Asia and other continents could more than make up for a lost Atlantis. So, Hancock dives, searching for a lost civilization that all that traditional archeologists have ignored.<br />This is fine work, until Hancock gets bogged down with incredible details. We slog through a boring discussion of whether molars on Malta were Neolithic or not. We meander around India, never quite getting to the bottom of what lay between Ceylon and the mainland. Hancock swims over the famous Bimini Road in the Bahamas only to leave undecided whether the formation is natural or man-made.<br />To make matters worse, the usually fine photographs by Hancock's wife Santha Faiia are so murky and indistinct that it's impossible to make up one's own mind.<br />Hancock's done an impressive bit of scholarship here. And I'm glad he's dropped his previous pet notion that Antarctica was Atlantis that somehow \\"slipped\\" to the bottom of the planet. I only wish the book weren't so mired in trivia and digression. A good editor could have trimmed this book by more than half and produced an exciting, revealing work of nonfiction.	2003-01-09

Set in the time of the Arab/Israeli war, it tells the tale of a psychic, gifted young girl who has to walk the line between a world of tradition and a world of change.<br />Hamiliton does a wonderful job of setting a sense of place and creates dreamy, mesmerizing characters. She also shows how the women--seemingly powerless--exert a strong command over small villages.<br />Although I think the mystery portion of this book was never fully realized, I believe it is a splendid look at how women function and even flourish in a changing, evolving world.<br />I look forward to her next book!	2003-01-01

US	52515788	R2WP5SL8TX1DBP	0425184943	453088490	Blue Diary	Books	3	5	5	N	N	I'm a Hoffman Fan and I was disappointed	I really wanted to like this book, especially after Hoffman wrote with such power in \\"The River King.\\" But I simply could not buy the premise of \\"Blue Diary.\\" Hoffman can't have it both ways: her villain is either an ordinary man or he is an evil wraith. If he's an ordinary man, his selfless new life should be reason enough to exonerate him. After all, confession, remorse and forgiveness are at the core of our justice and religious systems.<br />But if he is a purely evil construct, Ethan should not be the object of so much pity. The reader is invited to care for him and his acts of contrition. Then the author yanks him back and proclaims him to be not worthy of our symptathy. The book sets him up as a straw man and uses a very suspect plot device (the trampy teenage girl) to make him look as if he never changed his ways. I just couldn't buy it.<br />This said, Hoffman's descriptions and scenes are so pure I feel I am there in a Mass. summer. Her characters, other than Ethan, are lovingly and realistically drawn. I wish she'd stop the head-hopping and concentrate on one point of view at a time, but the prose does flow so well, the reader often does not notice this flaw.<br />I'm hoping for better next time. So much more could have happened in this story. And I do believe in redemption and forgiveness, so if Ethan was human, he got a raw deal from the author.	2002-11-26
US	52515788	R1UD33CEF4YO7Y	0425158640	575127070	Idoru	Books	4	1	2	N	N	another win for Gibson	Once you get used to Gibson's trademark scene-switching and confusing locations, IDORU works beautifully. It has a fairly lean plot and an elegant device that eventually links the point of view of two rather disparate characters. Once again, the post-apocalyptic/sushi-bar/virtual-reality world sucks the reader in. Some of Gibson's descriptions are simply breath-taking, especially the description of a Venice virtual-reality program that evokes the essence of Venice in winter.<br />The only problem I had with IDORU is that it didn't go far enough and the action was over before the core concept (artificial intelligence merging with a rock star) ever took hold. It's also difficult to believe that the 14-year-old heroine has the wherewithal to travel to Japan by herself, but that's a relatively minor (hahaha) issue.<br />All in all, this book is a great one for anyone who enjoys a look at the possible future of computers.	2002-02-01
US	52515788	R2RPXIHUFOOFJI	0688007961	273650394	Ancient Egyptian Magic	Books	2	61	77	N	Y	a fairly dismissive account	Brier, who wrote the wonderful MURDER OF TUTANKHAMEN, has written a book that is clearly dismissive of the religions and high culture of Egypt. In Brier's eyes, Egyptian religion was nothing but a silly lot of superstition. In fact, there is a highly symbolic nature to a great deal of Egyptian spritual thought that goes beyond a literal meaning of the hieroglyphs. Indeed, sounds were believe to hold vibratory magic, and anyone with sensitivity can read this in the hieroglypic texts. To read Brier, one would think that all they did was wear amulets to prevent illness and prepare disgusting mixtures for miraculous healing.<br />Surely, there were a large number of Egyptians who believed in all sorts of superstions, but Brier does not balance this fact with any of the many graceful, beautiful prayers that adorn the tombs. Surprisingly, good old Sir Wallis Budge summarizes Egyptian magic much better in his EGYPTIAN MAGIC. Budge has been considered outdated for many years, but his work still forms the basis of modern Egyptology.<br />All in all, this book was disappointing.<br />Lynn	2001-10-29

From beginning to end, Gaiman hooks the reader with humor, history, fascinating little side trips on the road to the heart of America.

Having read everything from crazed ravings to dry-as-dust tomes by geologists, Brennan's book comes across as breezy, informative and somewhat sensible. He goes astray at the end, in my opinion, when he poses the possibility of a supernova fragment causing the Atlantis catastrophe. It's really just too wild for me. I'm more inclined to go along with writers such as Andrew Collins who believe Atlantis is sunken in the Caribbean, the victim of a comet strike.<br />Still, this book makes excellent reading. And it's the perfect introduction to the Atlantis question for anyone who's wondering about it.	2001-10-29

(Brier says Tut was Akhenaten's son by a secondary wife and the curator agreed.)<br />I found almost nothing left out of this book and the scholarship was impressive. Whether it was murder that killed Tut will probably never be known, but Brier presents a good case.	2001-10-29

I found the theme of an artist's development to be  rich and true. The characters were complex and driven and I found the  romance quite believable. Also the setting in Florence was wonderfully  described by a writer who surely loves the city. This is a remarkable work  for a first novel. The shifts in time and switches from present to past  tense were a bit jarring, but eventually the style won me over.	2000-08-24

There are passages of description that simply dazzle. The scene in which heroine Kate first sees the gathering of the Men of Quetzalcoatl,  where the beats of the drums seem to draw the soul from the earth, is  absolutely mesmerizing.<br />Yet for every memorable scene there are pages  and pages of wild romanticizing about native values, obscenely outdated  musings about race, and odd sentiments about marriage and women. Unlike  &quot;Women in Love,&quot; this book doesn't present love in a very good  light. Kate is seen as a woman torn between her need to be herself and her  need to be subsumed  by a man. And the answer is unclear at the end. I  found her to be a sympathetic character despite her annoying quirks (if she  hates Mexico so much, why doesn't she just leave?) and I felt the ending  didn't show her growing or changing. I also felt that the other main  characters (Ramon and Cipriano) became almost brutal by the book's end, and  this development was not  resolved in any satisfactory way.<br />I have to  admit being profoundly disappointed by the ending, and by the bizarre  theorizing about the soul of the &quot;dark races.&quot; But, I had to keep  remembering that this book was a product of the early twentieth century.  And the writing is what still makes it masterful.	2000-05-28

Of all the books I've read on physics and spirituality--from Michio Kaku's &quot;Hyperspace&quot; to Gary Zukov's &quot;The Dance of the Wu Li  Masters&quot;--this book takes the prize for its elegance, readability and  ability to shock the sleepy mind.

This had  deep significance to a race of people who believed ''as above, so below.''<br />The reader who claims that Bauval now refutes his own Orion theory is  sadly misinformed. Anyone who is interested can go read Bauval's letter to  the BBC at [...] Apparently, the ''Horizon'' program, in  its zeal to knock both Hancock (not a pseudo-scientist but a talented  journalist)badly mis-represented Bauval's theories to the British viewing  public.<br />But read it for yourself. I think the sequel, ''The  Message of  the Sphinx,''is even better.	1999-11-30

Instead of cramming everything she can into each of the short stories that make up this book, Alice Hoffman  lets the tales unfold on their own time. It might take three stories to  understand the motivation of one character, but it's worth the time it  takes to get there.<br />I don't think this book was intended to read as a  novel, so I am mystified at comments of supposed missing depth. Hoffman's  book is a connected series of stories in which the reader is free to fill  in the gaps. I give her credit for experimenting with this form.	1999-11-30

Although the historical information was quite good, the mystery was awful: cardboard characters, an obvious villian,  unbelievable dialog, overuse of the same adjectives over and over. The  author even interrupts the climax to explain the theme to us poor,  brain-dead readers.<br />This book only deserves two stars (rather than one)  for its excellent historical research, which is well presented. As a  mystery, it's horrid. I play to say far away from Lyn Hamilton in the  future. However, if anyone would like to read a good Mayan-history based  book, Pat Murphy's &quot;The Falling Woman&quot; (Tor) is a fantastic book.  It's not a mystery, rather a fantasy or magical-realism book, but it's  quite wonderful and has all the element that this book lacks.	1999-11-27

This time the bad guy was academia and they were conspiring to keep us from the truth about the Sphinx.<br />Thank  goodness I actually gave the book a try. It's incredibly well written, full  of well-documented facts and packed with footnotes and pictures. Hancock  and Bauval turn out not to be conspiracy cranks at all; they have found  amazing evidence about the age and orientation of the Sphinx and the  pyramids. The problem is that the evidence flies in the face of everything  that Egyptologists want to believe.<br />I went on to read source material on  the Sphinx and am now reading Hancock's &quot;Fingerprints of the  Gods&quot; and am now more convinced than ever that Hancock and Bauval  speak the truth.<br />Pseduo-scientists? Well, only if you think that you have  to be a PhD to do painstaking research. Sometimes all it takes is a  dediction to discovering the truth.	1999-09-24

What stories do they hide deep in their  souls?&quot;<br />It's not just Hamilton's study of a gay man that wins my  respect but her dead-on look at a woman (Susan) who can be cruel and  self-centered while she is a loving a true friend. Or the neighbor who is a  health-food freak and a chain smoker. Or the bi-sexual lover (Mitch) who  can enter a gay relationship and then suddenly drop it like yesterday's  newspaper. All of this is so real, so true to the way people really  are.<br />This is a marvelously sensitive book full of humor and little truths  that will have you nodding your head as you read.	1999-07-31
