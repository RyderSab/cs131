You would think Daisy's Father would have been outraged by the thought of Duncan and his young daugher's affair.<br /><br />I didn't really see the point of this story. I felt bad for Daisy in that she was so mixed up after her stepfather died and Duncan took advantage of her.	2005-05-25

He comes up with interesting characters and situations. The Fourth Hand was like nothing I have ever read.  The only thing I did not like about this book was I feel it could have done without that whole chapter on Dr. Zajac. It was boring. I did not need to know about Dr. Z's failed marriage, that he was too skinny, that he had an obsession with dog poo.  That whole chapter, to me, had nothing to do with the rest of the story.<br /><br />Other than that, great book.	2004-09-02

I give the book 2 stars(as opposed to one)because the plot idea is different.<br />It took me a while to get used to the time skipping and Henry being different ages. Also two Henrys in the same scene(especially the 15 year old Henrys......that made no sense what was implied they were doing together!) bothered me.<br />I would have stuck with it, tried to go with the flow of the book, but it was not holding my interest. The conversations Henry was having with Clare were dull. zzzzzzzz The story did not seem to be going anywhere, so, sorry to say, it was put aside and I started reading something else.	2004-05-16

For one, how did Mirella find out her husband had an affair? Did she get a letter?  Did Randi say something? It was never explained.  Did I miss something?<br />Second, what was the deal with Randi? I know she was getting overly attatched to Jacob, but I thought before the story ended I would get some sort of explanation as to why she acted that way. Seems like there was more to Randi that never was explained.	2004-05-13

My complaints about the book would be 1) There should have been explanation of what all the French sentences meant. I didn't know sometimes what was being said as I don't speak French. 2)Part 4 was the most dragged out/boring part of the book. Who cares about Madeline's job as a comedian or her lesbianism?  Luckily Part 5 was much better. 3)Some of the descriptions of things went on too long.<br />Didn't see the ending coming. A bit shocking.<br />Overall, good storytelling	2004-04-18

The first 1/2 was fair. Carrie Fisher put just enough humor and interesting people in the mix to keep me interested in the story. 3/4 through the book, my interest started to wane. The story got less and less interesting. There was too much of Suzanne's thinking once she was in the mental hospital. I couldn't make it throught to the end. I had totally lost interest.	2004-02-28

Well, I feel this book does not live up to the hype.<br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" started off promising, but went downhill from there. The book jumped from 1973 to 10 years later too quickly. I agree with A Reader from Massachusetts who stated there seemed to be no mourning over the loss of Susie except for the Dad.<br />There were too many extra characters in this book that where unnecessary, especially Ruth. I felt she had no reason to be in the story at all. Who cares about Ray's Mom? What was the point of her character? Hal, Samuel's brother is another unnecessary character. I found it hard to believe a guy like Hal would be wasting his time baking with Susie's grandmother. Ms. Seabold should have axed these extra characters and spent more time developing Buckley.<br />I was really bothered by the end where Susie takes over Ruth's body. To me, that sequence just didn't seem to fit into this book.<br />I was expecting something totally different when I started this book. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" wasn't the worst book I ever read, but it certainly was a disappointment.	2002-08-30
