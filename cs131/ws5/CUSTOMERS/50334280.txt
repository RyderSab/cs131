While everyone has different levels of education, duly noted, and of course, different perceptions of the messages contained in Revelation, it nonetheless served its purpose: to entertain, and possibly to inform.  One thing that does not help is to take the contents of \\"Breaking the Code\\" and become involved in pointless bickering over who is \\"right\\" or \\"correct\\" and who is wrong.  The whole point of the book is to stimulate thinking and to broaden, however slightly, one's perceptions of the Revelation.  How or what happens after that is based on semantics, and not whether one \\"triumphs\\" over another intellectually.	2005-01-23

For this reason, I recommend &quot;A Furnace Afloat&quot; to all college and university students as mandatory reading, given credit as humanities and social science.  This is one of the best writing styles I've ever seen.  I dare not spoil the voyage for you; start at the beginning and read this work, don't just skim over it.<br /><br />Once you are reeled in, the frightening encounters with starvation, madness and the surreal begin to grip your imagination, and you have to remind yourself that this fateful voyage really happened.  Makes me glad for what little I have.  Now I don't feel so bad for what I don't.  These men had life far tougher than any of us will ever have to endure.  Forty-three days at sea after the fire, woefully undernourished and short of supplies, the Hornet's survivors as detaild by Mr. Jackson allows us to tap into the unique experiences of the crew and apply that knowledge to our own lives.  As Mr. Jackson put it, &quot;...in life, we are all at sea.&quot;	2004-07-01

It is understood that to better appreciate anything in our modern life we need to go back to its origins.  Authors Lamm and Holls did that quite adeptly with a wonderfully organized automotive chronology...with the pages beautifully arranged.  Most striking is the contrast and resolution of the black and white photographs, which, as the professional photographer already knows, are often preferred over color for those very reasons.  Beginning with a light treatise on shipbuilding as a starting point, our authors lead us on a journey through coachbuilding, the \\"Nuts and Bolts of Early Automotive Fashion\\" (Chapter 2) and styling designs of the Big Three Automakers: Chrysler, Ford and General Motors.<br />This book is not, however, simply an encyclopedia or recalling of events.  It analyzes the overall effect that the lives of the designers themselves, and their families, had on our own modern culture.  These insights are precisely what sets this book apart from a simple narrative with pictures.  Consequently, we can then appreciate how much work is actually instilled into what we drive today.  This book basically teaches us that automotive design is at the very foundation of our modern heritage.<br />Covering 306 pages over fourteen chapters, highly illustrated and perfectly indexed, \\"A Century of Automotive Style\\" is practically an education by itself, or more specifically, that of the social and economic impacts of automobile styling on our American culture.  Knowledgeable, well-written and extremely detailed, this excellent work is clearly indicative of our author's background at GM's advanced design facility and formal schooling in industrial design.  ...  My top recommendation for all readers.	2002-11-07

Well-researched and beautifully written. I admire Braun's naturally-written, eloquently styled nonfiction work. He has a special talent to translate scientific research and discoveries into the vernacular, so that you and I can better understand advanced subjects so that we can better enjoy life (well, of course, unless you're already a scientist).<br />The excellence of Braun's work in \\"The Science\\" is manifested by his uncanny ability to properly define his subject. He stays within those boundaries, being careful not to stray into an extensive treaty on the nature of neurotransmitters, hormones and other electrochemical interactions not part of the main subject. This he does adeptly, starting out at Chapter 1, \\"Prozac: The Next Generation\\" by telling us about the past, present and future of this wonder drug--and how it actually works and what we can expect when the monopoly lifts. Chapter 2, \\"Set Point\\" starts off with the fascinating account of a lottery winner, and spends a good portion of the chapter discussing whether or not those with all the money they need are really happier than the rest of us. The other chapters, 3 through 6, describe \\"The Machine of Mood\\" (he doesn't mean to say that our moods are robotic like a machine, but rather as complicated and intricate as a machine), \\"Listening to Depression,\\" \\"Selling Happiness\\" and \\"Zen and the Art of Prozac.\\" This book doesn't bog us down with needless details, it only covers what is relevant to the book's title (and that's a skill that seems to be hard for some writers to grasp--albeit as simple as it sounds). No fluff, no useless anecdotes, no religious preaching. Most of the fun from reading books like this is watching the author work. Don't expect miracles from \\"The Science...\\" It doesn't treat any one area of human emotions or behaviors exhaustively. It's not about depression, or even evaluations of depression in conjuction with finding \\"happiness.\\" It was written only to whet your appetite for a deeper understanding of neurological occurrences in relation to human moods in general, based on generally accepted theories to date.with finding \\"happiness.\\" It was written only to whet your appetite for a deeper understanding of neurological occurrences in relation to human moods in general, based on generally accepted theories to date.	2002-03-10

Proven by whom is not asserted; it is assumed to be of \\"Health Recovery Center\\" for which Dr. Larson is the director.  I have few negative comments about any attempt at promoting recovery from alcoholism.  Dr. Larson with Keith W. Sehnert, M.D. want to catch the coattails of AA's success and ubiquitous big book.  Covering 12 chapters and three appendices over 335 pages, it offers their advice for breaking the habit of alcohol addiction through a specially modified diet.<br /><br />I found nothing harmful in \\"Seven Weeks,\\" except one exaggeration that claimed one naturally occurring supplement (GLA?) could \\"reverse aging\\" (I tried to find it again, but it's in there). There are also some practical mentionings of \\"research indicates that...\\" many times throughout the pages, although to which research they are referring is not indicated.  Most of the time, Dr. Larson does cite her sources, and that makes all the difference.  On page 44 there is a nice and simple comparison chart of a Swedish Study vs. HRC results; but in this chart, the HRC study is claiming a 100% recovery rate from alcoholic symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, tremors, dizziness and three others.  Can they really do that?  Is anything 100% effective?  Most of the information in \\"Seven Weeks...\\" is sound, although at times a little eccentric.  On page 108-109, for example, we read \\"Since most alcoholics suffer blackouts, it makes sense to assume that insufficient tryptophan is to blame and that it also underlies any depression and sleeplessness they are experiencing.\\"  In any kind of scientific work, it NEVER makes sense to assume anything.  It is either conclusive or it isn't.  On page 144, they also state, \\"Insulin is the fat-storing hormone.\\"  Insulin metabolizes sugar, it doesn't store fat (or, that it is an indirect action of insulin).  On pages 94-113, everything mentioned about the role of vitamins, minerals and aminos is believable, verifiable and duplicable.<br /><br />I believe this book can be helpful for recovering alcoholics, in spite of that the carbohydrate-restricted diets might be difficult to follow.  To cut out colas, coffee, bakery products, fried foods, margarine, taco shells, or anything made with hydrogenated oils from the diet--even diet sodas and nicotine--all at once may seem too much at once for someone in recovery.  (We've got to have something left!)  The proposed diet is rigid, taking a strong will to accomplish, but the price of sobriety is incomparable (did I give away my anonymity?)  Details of the HRC diet and \\"Week Three: Correcting Chemistry\\" are at Chapter 7, page 115.  I was particularly interested in the section \\"The Role of Adrenals,\\" in which the authors discuss the effects of placing to many demands for adrenaline on the system, leading many alcoholics to suffer additional stress and emotional instability, even for a time after early sobriety.  In this case, I can personally verify that, and it makes perfect sense.  At Chapter 8, \\"Week Four: Tailoring Repair,\\" many suggestions and formulas are given for certain vitamin, mineral and amino acid combination which assure the reader they will help to reverse the undesirable effects of alcohol abuse.  Given the few overstatements and yet unproven FDA claims for certain minerals (e.g., chromium), and a few borrowings from the big book, I found nothing malignant in \\"Seven Weeks.\\"  I won't dog anything meant to help people get off of alcohol.  It is not meant for the general public; it is meant to be used in conjunction with a doctor's help to break the addiction to alcohol. AA's big book was the first of its kind to offer a self-help plan with other alcoholics in attaining this admirable and monumental goal.  This book is another next step, advancing this and new knowledge for the benefit of the common good.<br /><br />I do not view comments, therefore, I do not respond to them.t view comments, therefore, I do not respond to them.	2002-02-25

Before I reviewed this book, I pondered over the one-star reviews.  Why would anyone degrade this book, I asked, unless they had some new basis in fact that Dr. Chopra was intentionally trying to mislead his readers.  In lieu of what the author does at his seminars, it does not have any bearing on what he wrote.  I found nothing in this book that \\"violated the Hippocratic Oath\\" or was meant to purposely cause harm.  Nothing.  I, too, noticed that the author lacked bibliographic references, but upon a deeper reading Dr. Chopra clearly embeds his references right in the main text.  On pages 245-246, for example, even as early as this book was written (1993, about when new scientific discoveries were being made about the roles and rhythms of neurotransmitters, hormones and genes and how they are involved in the total life process).  I also found nothing that \\"does harm to a patient\\" or \\"places an unfair burden\\" on him or her.  The purpose of this book is nothing more than to offer reasonably coherent philosophical advice, tied in with physiological and psychological processes.  There is nothing in \\"Ageless Body\\" that is malignant.  I also did not see one single inference to the author's allegations about \\"living to be 200 years old,\\" as one reviewer hastily mentioned.  (It really is unhelpful to cite something without a specific location if it mentioned critically; to say anything good leaves more room for generalities).<br /><br />What I did find in this book, in fact, was nothing short of very informative and helpful.  So what if it comes off as common sense to some?  Does that make the author any less intelligent or unworthy to write about it?  No.  On the contrary, each of the five parts in this book is explained simply with little pearls of wisdom that are meant to BENEFIT life--not to \\"take money from a gullible public.\\"  If the reader seeks clinical proof, and if actual time is given to an unhasty review, it is clearly PART of the main body text.  A basic understanding of liberal arts will also make a significant difference in accepting Dr. Chopra's assertions.  They needn't all be taken at face value.  As an educated, wise mind thinks, take what you need and leave the rest; don't discard the whole thing as rubbish!  What the author really means, I think, with his title of \\"Ageless Body, Timeless Mind\\" is not the physical body so much as it is the INNER body, or spirit.  At once, the ignorant, showing their annoyance and intolerance, cast their objections in the form of a one-star review.  Perhaps it is jealousy in that such a person didn't think of writing a book like this first.  Whatever the case, Dr. Chopra presents his advice and teachings brilliantly and focused enough, free of religious fanaticism, to the point where a continual sidetrack of footnotes would detract from his subject.  From Part One, \\"The Land Where No One is Old,\\" a captivating title, to Part Five, \\"Breaking the Spell of Mortality,\\" Dr. Chopra only seeks to enlighten and guide, not to deviate and destroy.  I suggest losing the negative frame of mind and opening up.  That is the true mark of character.  This book deserves the same.  Remember, many personas throughout history were mocked and ridiculed in exactly the same way as some people have done here, long before their work was finally recognized as genius.  Again, history repeats itself.  I suppose, to the uneducated or overzealous, a work such as this is not welcomed in its own time--such as the prophet not recognized in his own land.

Restak, M.D., with a section for further readings, is an excellent text about the then new brain research (1994), when both doctors and scientists were beginning to discover and disclose specific actions of the brain's neurotransmitters and the broad effects on the body.  Dr. Restak explains in technical, yet easy-to-understand terminology the critical functions of dopamine projection, serotonin projection, in addition acetylcholine projection in the brain--and what it all means to you and I.  Part I covers subjects such as \\"Disordered Thought, Disordered Molecule\\" (Chapter 1), and chapter 3, \\"Magic Intoxicants\\".  From there, he moves through other important material to \\"Clasping the Neuron\\" and \\"The Anatomy of Melancholy\\" at Chapters 6 and 7, respectively.<br />\\"At every level these messengers and receptors underpin the behavior by which we define ourselves.  This holds true for everything from the twitch of an isolated muscle cell to the formulation of a unified field theory in physics.\\", our author explains on page 29.  \\"The brain's marvelous performance is possible because of its organization.\\"  I particularly enjoyed the elegantly simply diagrams of a neuron and a synapse on page 20.  Part II deals with drug interactions and brain coding and decoding.  \\"Russian Dolls\\" at Chapter 8 details this nicely, since \\"At each of these levels--molecules, synapses, neurons, networks, maps, systems, and the brain as a whole--information coding and decoding reflect information from all the other levels.\\" (page 92).  From \\"Good Drugs, Bad Drugs\\" at Chapter 10, through \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" and \\"Mr. Guinea Pig\\" at Chapters 13 and 17, Dr. Restak succinctly describes historical personas and their discoveries, and how they evolved into what more we understand today.<br />It is clear that this book was written from a sincere love of trade.  I can tell Dr. Restak loves his profession (a neurologist and neuropsychiatrist), and it is apparent this book wasn't rushed to the marketplace as a piece paid by the word.  There really is no filler here; all 221 pages are neat and clean, educational and provide a solid basis of neurology for the layperson as well as Dr. Restak's colleagues.  It allows us to understand what we put into our bodies ultimately affects our moods and our chances for living longer--or not.  Our author has a real gem here, clearly and I won't be able to take it all in on one pass from my library copy.

We now have a believable, credible new sourcebook about \\"Mood, Self-regulation and Overeating\\" (Chapter 1), and also my favorite topic at Chapter 8, \\"The Biopsychology of Energy and Tension.\\"  Now we really know why diets don't work, for example, and furthermore why skipping meals doesn't help us to lose weight--instead it only makes us irritable and even more tense by throwing our rhythms out of whack.  An outstanding presentation, with elegant and simple charts!  Diet and nutrition students, you now have a new required reading book, one that you will find enjoyable and worthwhile.  It was a wonderful learning experience merely to watch the author work, as Dr. Thayer dissolved the walls of diet myth and folklore, leading us instead into the realm of knowledgeable, practical solutions for enjoying life and living longer.<br />\\"Not only are negative moods in general improved with exercise, but exercise helps us overcome specific moods, such as mild depression\\" the author tells us on page 47.  Dr. Thayer continues on page 69 with a similar note: \\"Our thoughts and behaviors are inexorably driven by eating habits when we are in the grip of these negative moods.  He doesn't stop there and leave the reader hanging, like some authors do with unfounded assertions.  Ka-chink!  Those beautiful superscripts come down, engraving themselves on the pages, and sending us unemotionally to Dr. Thayer's sources.  Even the cover is gorgeous, nearly a work of art itself.  \\"Calm Energy\\" is easy to understand, yet does not at all lack the details needed to effect dietary changes (along with the help of a dietician or physician).  It will take more than one reading session to fully comprehend the implications, but they are in no way beyond a reasonable understanding.  Later, other people will think YOU'RE the doctor when they ask you why you're looking and feeling so good lately.

What is the angle here, anyway?	\\"The Coming Storm\\" by Bob Reiss discusses \\"extreme weather and our terrifying future.\\"  Now there's something to cast a gloomy shadow over your day.  Reiss, formerly of the Chicago Tribune, writes 322 pages over an indeterminate number of chapters.  Of the many hundreds of books I've read in the last year and a half, this is the only one--in my entire life, for that matter--that did not have a Table of Contents.  What?  I looked all over, but didn't see one--an inexcusable shortcoming in a nonfiction work.  The title of itself is a slippery slope, totally unresearched hyperbole of how we're all going to die because of what we've done to the weather and the surrounding environment.  Okay, so he's made a conclusion.  But where are the footnotes?  The endnotes?  Any references or sources that we can check out?  Nothing!  I can't stand reading a nonfiction book without them.  In fact, this is one of the very few that I've encountered that was composed in a strictly essaical, you've-got-to-believe-me-or-else undertone.  Sorry, Bob.  That's not good enough.  What classification of book is this, anyway?  Fiction?  Nonfiction?  The perspective is shifted so much, I don't know what to believe.  The writing style is typical of some newspaper reports who lead you in with a few sentences, fragmented and not really saying anything, then draw you to the back of the paper which at least has a few specifics.  Anything that we do as the result of our existence is easily compensated for by Mother Nature, as if we were able to outsmart her and the way she manages the atmosphere as the result of our ecological indifferences or shortcomings.  I still haven't seen Reiss' final conclusion or what he's really trying to say.  It must be buried in here somewhere, but I don't have the time to dig for it.	2002-02-17

I was intimidated at first because of the knowledgeable depth she so aptly displayed, but gradually I began to appreciate Wosk's underlying message that women will no longer stand to be ignored in the roles of human history.  Free of resentments and bitter feelings, Wosk discusses the treatment and attitudes of women since times of \\"the spinning wheel to the electronic age.\\"  \\"Women...\\" makes an excellent sourcebook for book reports, covering \\"Women and the Bicycle\\" (Chapter 4), \\"Women and the Automobile\\" at Chapter 5.  From there she moves into \\"Women and Aviation\\" and \\"Women in Wartime\\" at Chapters 6 and 7, respectively.<br />This book is beautifully arranged with full color photographs, old advertisements, curios, mosaics and even art.  As a grown man myself, I feel men could develop a deeper respect of women's roles in modern history, as well as a well-deserved slice of humble pie.  We can say, \\"No, women are not mechanically incompetent, nor are they completely helpless without men in their lives.\\"  This book has proven that women are quite capable and adept, having had an important role in shaping the 20th century and beyond.  Remember Rosie the Riveter?  There's a picture of her in here.  That women played a vital role in our World War 2 victory is self-evident, having left the role of housewife and instead have helped to build our fighter planes, gun turrets and tanks--which the fighting men used on the battlefields.  Men, take note.  Women, take hope.  We are, after all, together part of making the world a better place.  It's not always men first.  Women sometimes have the last word, and we have to accept that.  \\"Women and the Machine\\" is nothing short of brilliant and provocative, completely unequalled to date.	2002-02-17

Finally, a doctor with a thorough grasp of the English language has written a book with solid, verifiable references that are used in the main text.  I am disturbed when authors fail to mention their sources--clearly not the case here--as if we're stupid enough to say, \\"Okay, I believe whatever you say...\\"  Dr. Williamson has a real gem here on EXACTLY the subject I've been looking for: \\"The surprising link between starches and sugars and: high blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol, diabetes and much more.  This is the brightest new entry into the ranks of neuro-physiological links between the diet and specifically how foods and hormones affect the body.  As a bonus, the publisher didn't get carried away with aggressive type faces that jump off the page at you or distract you with unrelated inserts.  We now have a well-written, elegant sourcebook, up-to-date on the latest research linking insulin resistance to secondary and tertiary physiological affects.<br /><br />What really makes the book believable is the unbiased style of the author, gloriously free of emotional undertones and the scolding dietitian who implies that we're going to die tomorrow if we don't quit eating this food or that.  Instead, Williamson adeptly presents her latest research and findings objectively and lets the reader decide which course of dietetic therapy we should seek, along with the indispensable help of a physician.  I actually reached conclusion about the dangers of too much sugar in my diet which I pointed out in my own book, since knowledge works in harmony together, even for a drivers ed book and drivers education that helped to develop a drivers bible, which helps to reduce bad driving and aggressive driving leading to road rage and traffic fatalities.  I haven't even scratched the surface of the detail that the author covers, and it will be a real treat to discover how she ties everything together in relatively jargon-free narrative prose.

Dr. Esther Sternberg from the outset tells us that she wrote this book \\"out of a question\\" that \\"seemed ostracized from the rest of the scientific community.\\"  Clearly, it seems that the information in \\"The Body Within\\" is a daring challenge to present new brain-immune connection information to the lay public, and is determined to not let it stagnate only among the doctoral elite.  I found all 11 chapters fascinating and richly detailed, gloriously free of slanted opinions and filled with highly intelligent questions.  All 250 pages inform, with its interesting anecdotes and illustrations, and my gratitude goes out to Dr. Sternberg for ensuring that some of us, even though we do not have a \\"Ph.D\\" attached to our name, are nonetheless able to grasp concepts as the workings of the brain, the immune system and the role of various hormones and neurotransmitters.<br /><br />As a result, I learned much about neurochemistry and neuroscience from Dr. Sternberg who helped me make irrefutable connections between foods, moods, hormones and neurotransmitters.

So there is a definite link between drivers education and neuroscience, although not readily apparent to the layperson.  \\"The Balance Within\\" is solidly founded in irrefutable facts \\"collected from rigorously performed experiments.\\"  It is a real treat to read about such things as Chapter 5, \\"It's a Two-Way Street: The Immune System Talks to the Brain and the Brain Talks Back\\" and Chapters 6 and 7, \\"When the Brain-Immune Communication Breaks Down\\" and \\"Can Stress Make you Sick?\\"  I could easily spoil the conclusions of this book, which I dare not out of pure respect for Dr. Sternberg, especially when she so adeptly investigates such ideas as \\"Can Believing Make You Well?\\"<br /><br />Gradually the walls between the public and the scientific community are crumbling down, allowing us to make up our own minds and deciding what is right for our own bodies.  This book is groundbreaking, indispensable and should not be out of your hands for another second.  You may encounter resistance at first, as the author put it, \\"Whenever a new field comes into being, it comes up against the older dogmas.

Well-written with sketches and illustrations throughout, its 206 pages detail ideas and plans of &quot;creating livable streets and vibrant communities,&quot; a modern utopia with street murals, neighborhood get-togethers complete with lawn chairs and throw rugs--right on your local street. Engwicht views urban streets not as automobile thoroughfares, but as &quot;outdoor living rooms.&quot;<br />The problems with the implications of such an idealistic society are numerous. First, traffic movement is proposed to be cut in half in favor of using streets as social meeting places. Next, block parties and events are encouraged to take the place of cars. It's like the author is trying to make a stitch in time by tying in lifestyles of a hundred years ago and supplanting them like a template over a modern infrastructure. He's cast a line back in time and is trying to pull a deeper-rooted social structure, like reeling in a big fish. &quot;Look at what I've got!&quot; he exclaims, full of cheer and joy that is almost enviable. He writes of how if children begin to play in the street more often, that drivers will get used to the idea, and use the streets less and less as thoroughfares. Really? Worksheets are provided to analyze individual trips, the amount of time taken and the number of stops. Unfortunately, the worksheets take time to fill out, and most drivers are too tired to do anything that seems like work--especially when it reminds them of driving. Engwich says that drivers are moving too fast, but that directly contradicts his outline of &quot;cutting traffic in half.&quot; He's trying to appease the driver through somewhat childish visions of traffic slowdown--but what he really wants is traffic replacement by bicycles and walking. But there's really no place for the traffic to go--they have to drive home!  And this is where the reasoning of &quot;Street Reclaiming&quot; becomes unreasonable.<br />Americans value driving a car above anything else, based on noticeable automobile proliferation.  Engwicht somehow believes that drivers in the United States (the book was written in Australia) will actually surrender the power and control of their vehicles and magically redevelop a new social order towards peace and community involvement, with the street that you live on as focal point. Most Americans simply want their televisions, deluxe ice cream, to drive their cars and then go home to enjoy them indoors with complete privacy--the exact opposite of what the author imagines could actually happen in today's world. As preposterous as the book sounds, I somehow wish we COULD reduce traffic flow and increase a sense of community spirit in favor of what are fundamentally selfish attitudes. When egos overshadow social life, we can never achieve the neighborhood harmony for which Engwicht yearns. The ideas are noble, but after the &quot;speech&quot; and laudatory reviews are over, the people are simply not willing to actually do anything about it. The author asks the driver to give up his, the strongest addiction in the world.<br />Since the book was written in Australia where they have infinitely more sunny weather than say, Seattle, with only 60 or 70 sunny days a year where you can actually sit outdoors without either freezing or getting soaked, the principles of &quot;Street Reclaiming&quot; cannot take the place of a highly individualistic society as in the United States. The main reason is that drivers will simply not give up their cars in favor of anything that takes such a pleasure away. In a land where privacy rules over active community gatherings, the ideas of painted concrete, rugs and sofas lining residential streets are relegated only to dreams and the imagination. When automobile registrations are 950 per 1,000 citizens, a reversal of crowded, yet accustomed, modern social and infrastructure trendsin today's world is highly improbable. In the next world, however, I am all for it--no joke intended.n today's world is highly improbable. In the next world, however, I am all for it--no joke intended.	2001-09-08

As I write this, I feel glad that I do not have to restrain my beliefs to satisfy an unbeliever, simply because I can relate to every topic and subtopic within these pages. Written in 1987 with twelve chapters covering 275 pages and larger-than-average print, even the simply black-and-gold cover is attractive enough to keep this book worthy of my library collection. The beauty of &quot;Facing Death&quot; (not meant to be a morbid contradiction) is that the reader need not be a Christian to understand that more is in store for each of us when we die--after we physically we leave our body. There is no &quot;nothingness&quot; or pure neutrality. Dr. Graham makes little attempt at conversion, furthermore, but more at mere recognition of death itself. For some, there is little reckoning; that's why this book will help you with your reconciliation. Chapter by chapter, starting at &quot;The Last Enemy&quot; and &quot;Death: No More Taboos,&quot; Billy whittles away at the extraordinary fear surrounding the very topic of death. If an honest reading is given to Dr. Graham's excellent and sound treatment, it would be a wonder, indeed, if the reader wasn't moved to be better prepared for the inevitable, inescapable next life. Real-life accounts with other people are testified in this book with Dr. Graham, where he has a believable answer to almost every cognizant question. It doesn't matter what you believe, as the author lays between the lines, when you die the end of the world has come for you alone. What a terrifying thought it is to be unprepared, hints Dr. Graham, through Chapter 7, &quot;Life and Death Choices,&quot; and Chapter 8, &quot;Groping Through Grief&quot;! I found chapter 10 to be the most interesting, &quot;Where Do I Go When I Die?&quot; where it is discussed if we do the actually deciding whether or not to go to hell or to heaven. But NOWHERE is it mentioned that there is a middle ground, a safe area from which any of us are exempt from God's watchful eye or one of only two final destinations. &quot;Facing Death...&quot; should be a part of every Christian's library, or even the would-be believer. It is inspiring, thoughtful, thoroughly engrossing and highly intelligent. Nowhere are other religions or beliefs downgraded or disrespected. Every time you skim over the text, the passages come to light in a new way to renew your faith and to be prepared to meet Jesus Christ face to face. Even preparation of a will is discussed. It is well-founded in the Bible, with perfectly placed Scripture passages throughout--but not saturated or overdone. Dr. Graham weaves a fabric of belief with the Holy Bible and his profound, not-to-be missed message of preparation, and defeat of negative, unbelieving attitudes. I was saddened to see that it is out of print. Dr. Billy Graham has a distinct honesty among Christian teachers that is becoming more and more rare these days.

Skillfully written by Frank Coffey and Joseph Layden, it has the most beautiful, full color photographs in a single work that I have seen in the last 12 months of my research.  From the early days of the automobile in the 1890's and prior to 1996 and beyond, it adeptly covers automotive development decade-by-decade.<br />The wonderful hardcover version is large, 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot;, covering 11 chapters over three parts.  Part I, &quot;Driving Force&quot; solidly reveals the growth of the automobile from the horseless carriage up through Chapter 4, &quot;Labor Pains,&quot; which narrates the beginning and early history of automobile labor unions.  At first, both sides were bitterly opposed.  Fighting occurred.  Bloodied and bruised, the workers and the unions gradually united and worked out their differences--for the time being.  After all, World War II was approaching.  &quot;Social Mobility,&quot; Part II, starts at Chapter 5, &quot;The War Machine&quot; and describes how automobile production all but ceased after Pearl Harbor.  Automobile manufacturing became manufacturing for vehicles of war.  Chapter 6, &quot;The Post War Room&quot; and Chapter 7, &quot;The Open Road&quot; take you through this difficult and trying period so well with the photographs that you can almost smell the factory smoke and rubber tires, and hear the wrenches clinking.  Part III, &quot;Car Wars&quot; details the post-war priorities of Detroit: retool the factories, design new automobile bodies--with chrome and fins--and develop new engines and conveniences to welcome the new age of freedom.<br />Without a doubt, this is the best and most complete source of information about automotive development in America.  It is a virtual pool of American Culture, brimming with helpful anecdotes and interviews of personalities who were there as they happened.  I cannot imagine anyone interested in Americana or cars in general who would not be fascinated and impressed by this monumental and definitive pictorial of automobility.  &quot;America on Wheels&quot; should be required reading by all students of sociology and American History, or for anyone who appreciates the art of quality bookmaking.  It is well worth the money, a book you'll want to keep as long as you live.  Inset quotes in old-time black and white frames are the chocolate syrup on the ice cream.  In this sense, you'll eat it up!  Highly recommended for all readers over 8 (exceptional reading level).

A Must Have!	&quot;Ford: The Men and the Machine&quot; is the most definitive and complete book about the life and happenings of automotive's greatest man, Henry Ford.  His accomplishments as cited cannot compare to any other single figure in automobile history (or even business itself).<br />The book is nothing short of epic: over 800 pages and 36 chapters, plus appendices.  It starts off with the author's assessment of Ford's total contribution to life, starting at Dearborn Michigan in 1831.  The details are all-inclusive and mind boggling, right down to Henry's Sister's comments about his early days repairing watches.  The book moves slowly and steadily through Part One, &quot;The Rise of Henry Ford&quot; to Parts Two and Three, &quot;Glory Days&quot; and &quot;Grass-Roots Hero.&quot; Here the reader is given the unbiased account of even the thoughts of young Henry, and how he became so fascinated with what was then the latest thing: the gasoline engine, which he saw in 1877 from a trip to Machinery Hall in Philadelphia.  We are given the full story behind Ford's rise to power over other prominent automotive men of his time, such as the Duryea and the Dodge Bros., and particularly Henry Selden.  I found it exciting to read about how Ford didn't give in to a greedy, money-hungry individual like Selden who had no real engineering talent, but wanted only to rake in the royalties from his so-called gasoline engine that he patented in 1895 (it didn't even work as illustrated in his diagram, and Selden didn't even have a working model in an automobile until 1904--it went five yards and died!).  Ford held out through more than 10 years of court battles over the legal implications of the Selden patent, and won.  After that, there was no doubt that Ford had firmly established himself as a &quot;man for the people.&quot;  The victory over the Selden patent allowed ALL automobile manufacturers to keep their prices affordable.<br />Part Four, &quot;Henry and Edsel&quot; describes the business relationship with his firstborn son, and their occasional public disputes over company policies and overall business strategies.  Henry bitterly opposed automoible financing, for example, but Edsel was all for it.  Edsel was right, too, it was the only way to sell cars to lower-income buyers.  Of course, the whole story behind the biggest flop in automotive history, the Edsel car itself, is revealed.  What happened?  How much money was lost?  What were the shortcomings of the Edsel that ultimately was its demise?  &quot;...The Men and the Machine&quot; will tell you, without room for doubts.<br />In fact, as part of the research I'm doing for an automotive book of my own, I noticed at least three other authors in my bibliography that referenced this same book, perhaps Lacey's greatest achievement.<br />Parts 5 and 6, &quot;Henry II&quot; and &quot;Henry and Lee&quot; gradually move more away from the business side of the Ford Machine--but not altogether away--and gradually reveal personal aspects of later Ford generations and their family relationships.  Discussed are the development and marketing plans of the Mustang and Pinto which, ironically, were diametrically opposed to each other as complete success and utter failure.<br />This book is worth double the money.  Sometimes I am amazed at the length Lacey went to get his sources, over 50 pages of specific and varied references.  I feel fortunate to have a copy that is in good shape.  Every time I open the pages, I learn something new.  Each page informs, educates and increases depth of thinking, in that sometimes what appears to be a single invention is only a hub to other spokes of development.  &quot;...the men and the Machine&quot; actually helps me to think better overall.  I can then apply the underlying techniques to all situations in life; consider that one thing leads to another, and if this happens, then it will affect that and that, and so on.

MacArthur is a good, solid nonfiction work aimed at refuting arguments of nonbelievers and for believers to be cautious about their church programs becoming more like the world.  MacArthur is a prodigy of Charles Spurgeon, a 19th Century preacher who had strong evangelic convictions of which MacArthur says we are short of today.<br />The book is easy to read for anyone with at least a high-school education, and provides provocative arguments and defenses of the Holy Bible.  MacArthur's position in 10-chapter, 251 page text is that as time progresses, the church becomes more like the world.  He does this by first defining &quot;pragmatisim&quot; and saying, much to my agreement, that it is &quot;inherently flawed.&quot;  The church becoming like the world is the opposite of what should be happening, the author indicates, as the goal of every Christian is simply to stick to the Bible and not allow the church program to proceed as if it were entertainment.  I can sense the author's disdain of the church services he describes that resemble current hit television events--&quot;wrestling&quot; matches, short services so as not to interfere with the start time of major sporting events, and church itineraries that are &quot;market driven.&quot;<br />This work is excellent for both personal and group study, as its no-nonsense approach to getting back on track towards fundamental, evangelical worship and Bible study is tantamount to an unshakable Christian relationship with God and people.  I'm sure that different readers would have different interpretations, but the underlying themes of Bible-founded principles remains constant and unshakable.  &quot;Ashamed of the Gospel&quot; is well-researched and thoroughly founded in the Bible, giving ample and well-organized references and quotations.  MacArthur's work is a wonderful and necessary compliment to a believer living in a modern world whose faith is endangered daily by the pleasures and &quot;programs&quot; of this world.  It's nice to see that other Christians--whether or not they have written a book--that prove to the world that we're not &quot;ignorant and uneducated.&quot;  This book will, in conjunction with the Holy Bible, help to keep you on track towards the ultimate goals of what the book points out and is understood: to get to the real heaven that begins within you without losing your rewards, and never let an unbeliever outsmart you--as it is our common goal to lead them to salvation.

Fascinating and richly detailed, it details the most important and influential invention of the nineteenth century, besides the telephone, and its impact on everyday life.  There are 20 chapters plus an epilogue, \\"The Future of the Automobile\\" in this indexed work, full of illustrations that take a logical flow of direction.  It begins with \\"The Automotive Idea,\\" giving the reader a knowledgeable base with which to understand that the automobile was not the creation of just one person, but of many brilliant minds over the past few centuries.  It is almost hard to imagine the extent that the automobile has undergone to arrive in its present state, a hybrid of early chariots, bicycles and, believe it or not, simple tools.  Despite what the car hater may think, Flink points out that, regardless of the minority opinion the development of the automobile was a requirement.  It had to happen.  Basically the development of the car was a collective effort with no other ultimate expression.  From Chapter 3, \\"The Emerging Industry\\" and Chapter 4, \\"Fordism\\", on through \\"Hard Times\\" in Chapter 11--citing the impact of the Great Depression on the automotive industry--and on to Chapter 17, \\"Japan as Number One,\\" the book is difficult to set aside as it educate about how foreign markets began to take over in the 1960's and 1970's what was thought to be a singularly American creation.<br /><br />\\"The Automobile Age\\" is a must-read for any automotive mechanic or driving school instructor.

It is a collection of short stories from various authors, making it a collage of driving cultural tidbits that inform and entertain.  The hardcover edition is nostalgical, appealing--a beautiful, classical cover with natural, thick pages--that made me want to head down to Route 66 from beginning to end, and hit every diner in between.  I'm glad to be a part of the American Culture, and especially the driving culuture, as peoples past could not have imagined--nor enjoyed--the thrill at travelling at a mile a minute as easily as putting on your clothes.  &quot;Road Trips...&quot; is a journey in itself, and I dare not spoil the trip for you.  Lindamood did a fantastic editing job by keeping her hands out of the mix unless necessary; she let the writer do the talking.  Great reading for all minds over 15 (language).

No other book even comes close to the scope of this important topic covered in such magnificent detail!  Nearly 400 pages in length encompassing seventeen highly informative chapters separated into five distinct parts, this jewel of nonfiction work by authors Bennett Alan Weinberg and Bonnie K. Bealer is sure to mark it's place in history as the best in its class.<br />Part I, &quot;Caffeine in History&quot; tells everything you could possibly want to know about this powerful, world's most popular drug, from the Arabian Origins to its refined, almost religious use in Europe, blending into Part II.  Part III discusses the role of caffeine from a cultural standpoint and works its way into Part IV, &quot;The Natural History of Caffeine.&quot;  Of particular interest to me is Part V, &quot;Caffeine and Health,&quot; specifically Chapter 15, &quot;Caffeine and the Body,&quot; Chapter 16, &quot;Thinking Over Caffeine: Cognition, Learning, and Emotional Well-Being&quot; and Chapter 17, &quot;Caffeine Dependence, Intoxication, and Toxicity.&quot;  The details of how caffeine permeates every cell in the body are clear, straightforward and very comprehendible.  This book was written in a classical narrative style, wonderfully free of slanted opinions and unrelated ramblings in an instructional tone.  This is one of the most beautifully arranged and printed hardbounds that I have found, so much that after only a few minutes I had to get my own copy!<br />It is clear to me now that there are far more benefits to caffeine than detriments.  It has been proven to increase alertness, improve concentration and even to help with weight loss, and much more.  According to the book, it would take almost 100 cups of coffee to reach toxic blood levels!  Even on a day where I crave two or three double lattes, I can now rest easier knowing that I'm far below toxic.  But even here the authors make it clear that even after two strong cups of coffee, some of the well-known side effects can take hours to wear off: nervousness, talkativeness and anxiety.  It even compares and cross-references other elements of caffeine, a member of the methylxanthine family, to other important naturally occurring compounds such as theophylline and theobromine found in cacao and yerb mate.  Absolutely fascinating!  The book also has me convinced that I'm hopelessly hooked to caffeine--and not just from coffee!<br />The message: watch your intake of caffeine levels by knowing how it works in your body and where it orginated, and how other peoples of the world regard its use.  No other singular work encompasses the knowledge of the world's preferred drug of choice.  There is more than enough information to include as well-founded research of your own, based on the rock solid references, informative notes, beautiful black and white photographs and perfectly placed, highly detailed illustrations.  The page layout is practically an art in itself, set in an older typeface reminiscent of a proprietary Garamond.

As the cover implies, your mind, memory and mood can be profoundly influenced by what you take in your body, key among it various herbs, tinctures and many supplements and remedies found in specialty stores, and more often, even in the supermarket.<br /><br />\\"Mind Boosters\\" will reinforce or strengthen your knowledge of what you may need to know most in your life. I have made irrefutable links between foods, moods, herbal supplements and driving behaviors, or just human behavior in general.  Dr. Sahelian is the authority on neurochemicals and the way in which hormones and neurotransmitters play a central role in regulating the body and fight to maintain a precise biochemical balance.  Dr. Sahelian points out the role of St. John's Wort, Ginko Biloba, 5-HTP, GABA, Kava, and lots more, including the role of fats in the diet (did you know that the brain is made up of 60% fat?).  All this perfectly spread over the 22 chapters. Part I starts right at the beginning with, \\"Using Your Brain...\\" and can have an ordinary person with reasonable capacity to take in new information beginning to understand some important functions about brain and mind and body interaction. It's like this doctor doing a basic, bare-bones sketch to brand new medical students--and the book does have great, easy-to-understand illustrations. For these reasons, this book will have you so smart by the time you are done that, if you follow the advice (with the help of a doctor), you will have little need to worry about suffering the effects of neglecting your body's precise chemical balances. Also discussed are the role of receptor sites, and how they can be intercepted by pseudo-neurons, or neurons that were \\"faking\\" the fingerprint of another.<br /><br />Dr. Sahelian is a terrific writer. Not one word is wasted, every sentence informs, every chapter educates. I've memorized most of the acronyms, and when you start rattling off these terms at a stressed, depressed or oppressed person because their diet is lacking, they stand back at their impression of your knowledge.  \\"I think you should start by cutting back on the coffee,\\" I tell them gently, and furthermore \\"pick up a good Vitamin-B complex, along with a choline and inositol supplement.  You might also consider some gamma-aminobutryic acid or dihydroepiandrosterone, along with a 50-mg. supplement of 5-hydroxytryptophan.\\"  They say, \\"Whoa!  I had no idea I needed those.\\"  The bottom line: the foods and drinks we assimilate are all precursors to hormones and neurotransmitters in the body.  So if someone is not eating right or getting enough fluids, well, would that explain why, for example, they are depressed, anxious, obsessed, frustrated or angry all the time?  Check your diet first!  \\"Boost your mind\\" is the cornerstone of Dr. Sahelian's work, in which he really knows his subjects. This book should be worth scholarly credits.

Wiley, at first had me glowing like a kid who just got a new train set for Christmas.  There are all kinds of interesting theories, personal anecdotes and zealous preachings, and some practical advice.  But I became suspicious when the contributing author (Bent Formby), a doctor nonetheless, was superceded by a layperson!<br />I then turned to the back of the book (as I often do first) and looked at an almost insurmountable one hundred pages of references with no annotations or links to the subject text.  Perhaps the author read all of these references, or perhaps Wiley just skimmed them over.  But no specific references or links are given to any paragraph in the text, which then places the reader in the position of verification.  Wiley is convinced, for example, that modern evils of violence are due, in part, to watching simulations of violence late at night (e.g., movies, television, video games) instead of sleeping: the absence of light during winter.<br />While it is understood, furthermore, that over-consumption of sugar (carbohydrates) plays a role in glucose levels, there is little mention of specific combinations of events with neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, melatonin, dopamine and insulin.  In this sense I would heartily agree with other (educated) reviews who demand more scientific, rather than slanted, presentations.  Credibility is the issue here.  The book does, however, give the reader ideas to think about: the key conclusions about the role of sleep and blood sugar in the body's rhythms.  I am intrigued at the mention of glucose levels to violence and aggression.  But to ignore nutritional requirements, even when coming from a layperson, is not acceptable in a work of this magnitude.  The reader then is given the (unfair) task of verifying what the author purports.  I nevertheless enjoyed reading the book objectively.<br />I cannot give less than three stars to anyone who went to this much trouble to at least get the book into print, and try to get a reasonable warning proclaimed about possible errors in our diets and our circadian rhythms which have been superceded by pleasure.  As far as the overzealous tone of the book, it is really out of place with its subject, although I admire the passion which I can sense at composition.  The editing, which requires almost as much work (if not more) than the making of the manuscript, should have caught the oversights that other reviewers spoke about.  A revised edition, Wiley and Formby, is in immediate order.  Then, we'll try it again to see if a change of lifestyles is indeed warranted.the book into print, and try to get a reasonable warning proclaimed about possible errors in our diets and our circadian rhythms which have been superceded by pleasure.

I've been through over 300 books in the last three months looking for a neuro-chemical link between aggression and violence, specifically &quot;impulsive&quot; aggression, that from which I have, at times, suffered its unpleasant effects.<br />Niehoff clearly shows her education and scientific background through her writing.  This book is throughougly and adeptly referenced down to the smallest detail.  Every sentence informs, every page educates.  I learned, for example, about the role of serotonin, the master hormone, and norepinephrine, and how they keep each other in check.  One controls aggression, the other fear, both having specific receptors which, it is to be discovered, sometimes receive signals from other neurotransmitters and hormones (and also caffeine!).  The role of environmental factors is given a fair and impartial comparison in conjunction with the actions of the body's hormones, increasing Niehoff's conclusion and credibility.<br />There is far too much information to be absorbed briefly; a detailed study is in order, well worth its rewards.  I have found this work to be monumental, and while not solving the total violence problem, will at least lead the reader to make better choices at the root: the diet (foods are converted to make certain hormones and neurotransmitters).  Also of interest is the treatment of insulin and its role in the body.  A complete, highly informative work, unparalleled in depth and understandability by the educated layperson.  Top recommendation!	2001-03-20

If you have the book, you may pick up a bit of homespun advice about driving in general, such as the author's sketches of braking systems and what happens to a car in a skid.  If you do not have the book, you should not feel that you are missing out.<br /><br />Pease's book is a detailed, personal perspective of what it's like to own a car, and all that goes along with it.  The subtopics are many, the focus is non-existent, but the effort is surely there.  Pease informs us that he felt eight publishers made a mistake by rejecting his book, so he decided to publish it himself.  I did not find the book helpful only because I knew everything about which he was writing. Perhaps if this book was released twenty years earlier it might read better.  Today's readers are probably two to three times more intelligent than before, due to the sheer volume and accessibility of driving knowledge and driving information today.  The word \\"I\\" is used more times than can almost be counted, and when trying to teach drivers, regardless of the subject matter, \\"I\\" statements take the focus off the subject and onto the author.  It is a mistake to let too many clothes into the wash, referring to the number of friends that Pease let review and edit his chapters.  If I were to have edited this book, I could easily cut the number of words in half, and eliminate the multiple perspectives (e.g., first, second and third) and the overstatements of the obvious (e.g., everyone knows that brakes stop the car, whether he or she drives or not).<br /><br />There are over forty chapters in Pease's book and of them, perhaps five percent have to do with the book's title.  This book would be better simply by changing the title to \\"Pease's Guide to Automobile Ownership,\\" or \\"On Driving\\" or \\"Robert Pease: A Driver's Perspective.\\"<br />--------<br />I do not view comments, therefore, I do not respond to them.I do not view comments, therefore, I do not respond to them.	2001-02-26

I should know, because I've been there. Automobile driving and driving psychology are passions of mine, not just because I want other drivers to better learn the rules of the road and develop a driver's code of conduct, but more importantly, not to become like the aggressive drivers or road ragers and rather to behave properly like a Highliner behind the wheel. In other words, in a sudden moment of clarity, I realized this book was for me without first understanding why. My lack of closure of past negative events helped me to learn not to take out my frustrations onto other drivers, but to act more like a human being behind the wheel and not an animal, and the result is a solid set of rules of the road and driver's code of conduct that will help to eliminate bad driving and lead to driving right and an overall good driving book that can boost driver's education and a solid driver's ed program on a personal level.<br /><br />Although this is an older text, it is still worth keeping on the nighttable as a refresher, or just when the edge of good driving is starting to dull again. The beauty of 'Steering Clear...' is that it is well written, direct and yet humorous at times, which means that even a driver without a college degree can benefit from its directions.	2001-02-08

However, King's work since 1990 has been a different story, so much so that I have quit reading him altogether. King's dialogue is just plain boring, and not much of it contributes to the backstory or keeps the plot moving. Often, I just give up after reading five chapters of say, \\"Insomnia\\" or \\"Dreamcatcher\\" or \\"Bag of Bones\\" that was banal at best. I need action, I need real suspense, I need to be engaged with what I read--not put to sleep.<br /><br />\\"On Writing\\" is more of a \\"do as I say, not as I do\\" kind of essay, and for that it has merit. Some parts were also amusing, and King tells his own story much better than his fictional characters. It's too bad, though, as the one lesson he did not teach would benefit would-be writers: length of itself is not a plus. Too many pages is a turn off. Say more with less, not less with more.<br />--------<br />I do not view comments, therefore, I do not respond to them.is the goal of all good books.  The journey itself exposes the tools of the knowledgeable writer: subject placement in apposition of the noun, words intentionally omitted, object of the preposition after the verb, sparing use of adverbs and perfect control of adjective placement (e.g., best before the noun it modifies).  &quot;On writing&quot; succinctly touches on a peeve of King's, namely good use of dialog; he disdains poor dialog, and begs the budding fiction writer to avoid telling the reader the obvious.  For example, do not write &quot;His teeth clenched tightly,&quot; for there is no other way for teeth to clench.  King also provides examples of how NOT to write dialog, which are quite amusing--and there you have an unexpected gift of writing well: humor.  That good humor is hard to find these days, always looking for originality, is another reason why my copy of &quot;On Writing&quot; will never see the second-hand store.<P>So, you are being shown how to write without being told you are being shown.  You are learning what's between the lines.  King gives perfect examples in the style alone of the declarative sentence, the balanced sentenced, the parallel sentence and the exclamation (&quot;Whoosh!&quot;), the interrogative (&quot;Which way did he go?&quot; and the mood of the subjunctive (&quot;I feel terrible!&quot;, or &quot;I sat behind that desk for six years with horrid hangovers...&quot;)--all of which are adeptly connected with the ordinary conjunctions of and, but and or--just like the unforgettable jingle commercials in the 1970's (&quot;Conjunction Junction, what's your function?&quot;).  There are many other examples of diction, syntax and style that jump right off the pages which had me saying, upon detection, &quot;Oh!  I get it!&quot;  On and on King and the reader travel, your journey being perfectly controlled by your host, until you arrive at the end of the book, almost unexpectedly.  You will then know just about all you'd need to improveyour writing, whether your genre is fiction or nonfiction.  Think like a writer.  Read Stephen King!  You should then know, once again, that the journey itself IS the lesson.  My absolute highest rating.  For readers 13 and over.  Buy it today!	2001-02-08

This is the only book of its kind, and made me want to immediately take a vacation--whether in an electric car or not!  Perrin's journey takes him across America with Solo, his converted Ford Escort wagon, and he writes about a good portion of American culture, right down to his thrill to spend only $21 for a night in a hotel in Utah.  He writes about all the questions posed him, the curiosities that were too irresistible to pass up, such as how expensive are the solar panels, what is the car's range, is it expensive to convert a regular car, and so on.  Although Perrin's book is already over eight years old (and I was saddened to see that it is out of print), it is clear there has been some progress since the electric cars that basically had only one power source that was cheap, reliable and had a reasonable life expectancy, albeit a dangerous one: lead-acid batteries.  I would feel uncomfortable sitting on top of (or near) 800 pounds of sulfuric acid.  Solo has a limited range, only 150 miles a day and can only get up to about 65 MPH.  The drawbacks come when accessories must be used: heater, lights, and defogger.  I wouldn't have the patience to drive such a car, but maybe driving such a car would teach me patience.<br />I loved this book!  Perrin makes nonfiction as literature an art, and breathes new life into travel writing.  His book is very helpful in itself about a good, consistent writing style, and I love it when the writer takes me to the places he visits: sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and so on.  In that sense, &quot;Life With an Electric Car&quot; has no equal yet, and the author knows it.  If you can find this book, buy it and keep it.  Perrin's book is like a good drink that is sipped, not gulped down.  Read it slowly.  You may begin to think that the days of gasoline powered cars are numbered.  That they are.  Highly recommended for readers 14 and over.ded for readers 14 and over.	2001-02-06

Reading this book is one of the few things today that makes me feel like I'm actually in the 21st century, not stuck in the 90's and never progressing.  The book has a wealth of information not found in any other book, and there are only a few books about the future of automobiles.  I had no idea that big automakers were not really in a hurry to give us a truly revolutionary car with a new power source; it seems the profit margin was less for holding off in research and development because of some link with oil companies.  I mean, come on, it's the year 2001!  Where are all the cars like we saw in Bladerunner?  Are we still stuck using twenty-miles to the gallon gasoline internal-combustion engines?  What is the message from automakers when cars depicted in video games, for example, seem more real than the actual future?  Why isn't there yet a car that is beyond what we have?<br />The book discusses much needed information about &quot;the race&quot; to build cleaner cars, and that a car with no emissions--a technological difficulty in itself--is actually possible.  The questions of fuel efficiency, speed, power and appeal of futuristic cars are also addressed, indicating the knowledgeability of the author.  Key among the topics of &quot;Forward Drive&quot; is affordability.  I would not pay $100,000 to drive a non-polluting car, simply because I'm not willing to pay that much just to drive.<br />Motavalli, editor of &quot;E:&quot; magazine, clearly shows his love for the craft of writing nonfiction.  &quot;Forward drive&quot; cannot be fully absorbed in only a skimming or a preview; it takes a dedicated block of time to actually read its pages carefully.  I have found it very helpful as a reference in the book that I am writing.  This book is one of those you don't want to bring to the second-hand store if you have any concern at all about the future--which is actually right now.  Highly recommended for intelligent minds.  It's about time we have some new information about something that affects the majority of Americans: driving.  Buy &quot;Forward drive,&quot; you won't be disappointed.h is actually right now.

Simpson Got Away With Murder	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Does What a Book is Supposed To Do  ^O^	Provocation is the only true mark of whether or not an author has an acceptable thesis.  \\"Outrage...\\" certainly does provoke its readers, whether for good or ill, and it is this provocation that makes Bugliosi's outline argumentative.  An argumentative conclusion makes far better reading to the intellectual mind over the dull and uninteresting, that which failed to take a risk.  While we cannot say for certain what would have made Mr. Bugliosi a better lawyer had he been allowed to prosecute the Simpson case, the leader is left with sufficient doubts about the quality with which the entire judicial process was handled at that time.  Judge Ito, defender Bailey and prosecutor Clark are all intricately and adeptly scrutinized, not to mention the suspect himself.  Whether or not Mr. Simpson was actually guilty is irrelevant, even though he was found innocent of the gruesome murders of which he was accused.  Whether Mr. Bailey, a highly-paid and well respected lawyer, was merely playing to the courtroom and television audience with dramatics does not matter.  What really matters is that the audience of \\"Outrage...\\" is left thinking, to wonder what could have been missed, and what actions left undone would have bettered the legal proceedings.  The book is compelling.  Brought to light are the fumblings of the Los Angeles police department and their bunglings at the Rockingham estate, in addition to the entire transcript of OJ's interrogation, verbatim.  It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.  Because Mr. Bugliosi's style is provoking, having weaved an intricate pattern of intelligent reflection on the Simpson case, is reason enough to read \\"Outrage...\\" as a thinking-man's curriculum.	2000-12-23

Roger Ames' translation leaves no room for doubt, and it is a great honor to have this beautiful and elegant book in my collection.  It was a treasured birthday gift.  Yes, you can believe all the good things people have to say about &quot;The Art of Warfare.&quot;  If you understand this book, you can readily overlay it on any situation in life: at work, while driving, at home, or at the coffee store.  The most important point I learned from this particular translation is the clarity of the interpretation of Sun-Tzu's constant philosophy of understanding correlative pairs (e.g., &quot;where there are birds gathered in the trees, the enemy is not encamped nearby; when he is near, the birds are not gathered; when you are ready, appear to be not ready.&quot;  There are dozens of such gems of knowledge that make me wonder why I didn't figure out something like this first.  I have not read other translations of &quot;The Art of Warfare,&quot; and, at this point, would not want to have what I have learned from Ames' translation diluted.  I highly value this book.  Whatever you pay, it's worth every penny.  I even love the smell of the paper and ink, the beautiful fonts within its pages, including the original scripts in Chinese (which I have little hope of understanding).  You can learn to write from reading this book, like I have, as there are no unnecessary words, no fluff, just 100% meat.  My absolute highest recommendation!  Do not think, just get it.  Read it, savor it, and then apply it to your life.  Others should then be able to tell if you did.	2000-12-19

There are no opinions here, only straightforward, &quot;this is how it is&quot; rules and anecdotes of English instruction. The underlying point, like all good English books, is that there really is no new way to say, &quot;it is,&quot; although overuse of &quot;be&quot; is a detriment to vivid writing.  Rather, the point is certain words and expressions fade out and must eventually be replaced, such as &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou.&quot;  The English language, like all human languages, change over time, but some standards must remain.  The use of plurals, capitalization, gerunds, prepositions, and so on, will still be the same.<br />This book can be read cover to cover in less than four hours by an &quot;average&quot; reader, and after several more passes, the what was once forgotten rule becomes a part of memory. It is enjoyable to read because there are no tests.  This book helped also me to write better.  Before I would sit at my computer for a writing session, I would have the cadence of &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; going through my head.  This book should be on the shelf of any would-be author, editor, word processor or office supervisor.  Get it, read it, memorize it. Learn the basics before you move on to more complex pieces of writing. You will become more confident for having done so, and your readers will be able to tell.	2000-04-03

If it was not for this book, I could not have written my first book nearly as well.<br /><br />It is said that brevity is the mark  of wit.  William Zinsser exemplifies this perfectly in this book, namely  that most adverbs are unnecessary.  In one chapter, he has three  complete  sentences in a row with only two words each, the subject of each understood  to be \\"you.\\"  Be content.  Be annoyed.  Be angry.  How can you be  slightly content?  Slightly angry?<br /><br />The key point of \\"On Writing  Well\\" is that every word you write which does not do useful work must  be removed, thereby improving the efficiency and clarity of your subject.  Why say, \\"at the present time\\" when you can say \\"now.\\"  Why say, \\"the fact that\\" when you can say \\"because.\\"  Do not be afraid to say, \\"It is raining\\" instead of, \\"At the  present time we are experiencing precipitation.\\"  I love advice like  that!  There are many other jewels of knowledge which turn a rough sentence  into a polished jem.<br /><br />The best chapter in this book is \\"Bits &  Pieces,\\" which does an excellent job of giving the reasoning behind  good and bad writing.  The chapters on travel, technology and criticism are  especially helpful, and the author, in the process, takes away the doubt  that can crush an otherwise good writer.  Mr. Zinsser does not try to sound  profound, but rather does a professional job of \\"instructing\\" the  reader as a student and collegue.  He writes from the presumption that you  only have a minimal understanding of English.<br /><br />This book is like having a  personal tutor every time you open it.  I have read it over at least five  times, and I occasionally find what the author was writing between the  lines.  It is not, by any means, to be compared with a boring textbook.  \\"On Writing Well\\" was written by a man who truly loves his work,  and it shows.	2000-02-24
