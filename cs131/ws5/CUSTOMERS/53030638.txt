I hear Jeremy Brett in every word of Holmes dialogue in these novels.<br /><br />As the fans of a television show will detail events going on offstage during an episode, Douglas shows us details of Holmes' investigations that would not have seemed pertinent to Conan Doyle as he wrote -- but he might well have been thinking of them. She twangs every Holmsian heartstring with her deft expansion of the Doyle tales.<br /><br />There is one difference though.  Douglas shows us a 21st Century woman in Irene Adler, a woman truly with A Soul of Steel (as this novel will be retitled in its December 2005 release,) a woman Doyle could never have written.  Adler's biography makes her attitude plausible, and we can easily believe she bested Sherlock Holmes more than once.<br /><br />Even if you've never read any Sherlock Holmes -- read these books.	2005-10-10

So the heros of my own novels tend to be male. I have to make a conscious effort to cast a woman in a heroic part in one of my sf/f novels, though I managed it in DREAMSPY they tell me.<br />I could never have accepted Sherlock Holmes as a woman in some alternate universe continuation.  Laurie R. King has found the perfect compromise -- an apprentice who is a)female, b)a love interest who becomes Holmes' wife, and c) oh, very much a hero in her own right, without losing the characteristics of a woman of her time.  (she reminds me of my grandmother)<br />Many of us think of the 1970's as the most significant period of feminism.  But the 1920's were pivotal in changing the way women think about themselves too.  JUSTICE HALL is set in 1923, in and around a ducal country house, a mansion slowly being taxed into a ruin.<br />The 1920's were an interesting time in England -- there was still a very strong feudal heirarchy in charge of everything, but the modern world was fast emerging from within that caste system.<br />Laurie R. King has captured the flavor of that era without an overburden of unnecessary detail.  She has used the correct words to name various things we don't see everyday in the 21st century.  She has transported us to a drafty, cold, impossible to heat, understaffed mansion and made us believe every word.<br />Here Holmes isn't even certain he has a case, and with Mary Russell on the job, he ends up solving 2 cases.<br />Over the course of this series of novels, we have seen Mary Russell become proficient in Holmes' &quot;methods&quot; -- and with that proficiency has come Holmes' trust.<br />In JUSTICE HALL as in many of the other novels in this series, they work the case separately, but with beautiful coordination.  I loved watching the two of them assessing the dual personalities displayed by their &quot;guides&quot; from O JERUSALEM. King has given us the vision of the deep cover secret agent's primary problem and made us believe every word.<br />One important point is contained in the author's afterword regarding the changes in the law pertaining to a soldier who deserts under fire or refuses an order under combat conditions. This is fiction rooted in historic reality, and yet still very definitely fiction.<br />What I like best of all I think is that now I get a chance to BE Sherlock Holmes by walking in Mary Russell's shoes!<br />I had the delightful experience of finishing JUSTICE HALL and starting THE GAME immediately.  For those new to these books, I'd recommend amassing as many of them in the correct order as you can and just reading them straight through.us the vision of the deep cover secret agent's primary problem and made us believe every word.  <br />One important point is contained in the author's afterword regarding the changes in the law pertaining to a soldier who deserts under fire or refuses an order under combat conditions.

I read 4 from the middle of the series in order, with some skips, then picked up 4 more and put them in chronological order.  I read Purity  -- then Reunion and Portrait, bracketing Purity.<br />Hey, folks -- I do seriously recommend nabbing this series as a set and reading them in their proper order.  There's a major story-arc involving the two main characters, Lt. Eve Dallas and a financier named Roarke, and piecing their story together is not nearly as enjoyable as reading it straight forward.<br />However, each book does stand alone as a Police Procedural Mystery.  And the Mysteries are solidly plotted and well turned at the end.  There's enough background of previous books so you can read out of context without being bewildered.<br />The third element in these novels that makes them of primary interest to me is that they are set in 2050's and beyond, where Earth has business interests on other planets.  I so far have not read a story where Eve goes offplanet with Roarke, but I saw a reference to such a visit.<br />But I don't have much hope for that novel because of the short-shrift given the third element in this series.<br />That third element is the weakest part of these novels, and if futurology matters to you, skip this series.<br />The author has not done the sf novelists' mental work -- extrapolation, or &quot;What if ...&quot;  So the series as a whole does not make a solid, well developed argument for future history taking a particular track.  The kick an sf reader looks for in a near-future novel just isn't there.<br />There are bits and pieces of what looks &quot;futuristic&quot; but isn't really.  Much of the fashion and computer technology assumes that things won't change as much in the next 50 years as they have in the previous 50 years.  Each futuristic item is apparently chosen from a different extrapolation line than the others, so they clash instead of adding up to a vision of the future.<br />At this point in the series though, I think Roberts/Robb is paying attention to complaints about the futurology and really trying to include some.  The strain shows, to those who look for the bits and pieces to explicate some sort of theme.<br />She knows how to use theme.  Her mystery plot has a thesis and makes a statement about that thesis.  Her romance plot zeros in tightly upon a very sharply defined thesis about Relationship and shows character development with a grace and style any writer could envy.<br />But she doesn't use those same skills on the futurology.<br />She has not even attempted the 3rd of 3 major requirements for writing an science fiction/ fantasy novel -- &quot;What if ...?&quot;  &quot;What if the Homeland Security department concept succeeds?&quot;  &quot;What if the Homeland Security department concept fails?&quot;<br />OK, she's inserted a historical event known as the Urban Wars -- but that doesn't qualify as good futurology without considerable support within the other elements of the story.  And she ignores today's headlines as sources of &quot;What if ...?&quot;<br />She has done &quot;If Only ...&quot;  (the 2nd of the 3 requirements for an science fiction/ fantasy novel).  Her Relationship extrapolation is definitely an &quot;if only...&quot; statement.  If only men and women could get along like this!<br />But she hasn't applied &quot;If Only ... &quot; to any other element in the story.<br />&quot;What if ...?&quot;  &quot;If Only ...&quot;  and &quot;If This Goes On ...&quot; are the 3 most important elements in sf/f.  A novel which has all 3 done to perfection is always considered a classic, and few writers achieve all 3 in one novel.  I would expect of a New York Times Bestselling author a much better performance than this.  OK, I am holding her to a very high standard, and perhaps that's unrealistic, but it's my expectation as both a professional sf/f writer and as a reader.<br />So for these lacks, I have to withhold a star at least, maybe two for some novels.  However, I have to give her credit for playing another game that sf/f writers and readers love.<br />She's playing up the in-group jokes for all they're worth.  She's borrowed from a number of classic novels, from TV shows, and other well-known sources. If you're not widely read you'll miss the best parts of these novels!<br />As I said in a previous review, she has given Ayn Rand a nod with the Roarke character's name, profession and attitudes.  And I doubt anyone has missed the Elizabeth Peters nod with the name of the Peabody character.  Amelia is of course an Egyptologist, so I keep expecting Peabody to turn up with some marvelous incidental knowledge that can be put to use.<br />However, Peabody does have these fascinating parents -- one of whom is a psychic Healer, the other very wise.  One of the disconnected and apparently random bits of futurology that doesn't &quot;add up&quot; to any statement but is &quot;borrowed&quot; from major sources is the way Peabody's father's healing talent is taken for granted by everyone.  And Elizabeth Peters doesn't shy away from occult undertones.<br />Yet Roberts/Robb does nothing with that except that fabulous concept Dallas gets healed so she can close a case.<br />This series is soooooo goooooooodddd!  &quot;If Only ...&quot; it's futurology was as good as the romance and mystery, it would be a solid 5-star all around great, an immortal series that would live forever.<br />As it is, I'd advise you to buy the paperbacks, even used copies, and not bother to try to save them for your grandchildren.  They will not understand what you think is so great about them.

GLORY IN DEATH was the first I'd read.  Yes, GLORY is #2 in the series and CEREMONY is #5 -- I'm skipping because these are the volumes I was able to lay hands on.<br />Despite the gaps in my reading, each book reads very well.  There's no confusion or disorientation because of the missing episodes.<br />As I said in my review of GLORY IN DEATH -- this is structured to become a television series using the long story-arc of the developing Relationship as the envelope and presenting a whole new mystery episode in each 1 hour drama.<br />If the futurology were worked into the mystery and relationship, IN DEATH would be as good as Babylon 5.<br />Up to CEREMONY IN DEATH, the futurology is almost entirely missing.  Though this series appears to be set in the future, the story, the romance, the mystery and the solutions could just as easily happen today.  There's no reason internal to the story for it to be set in the future.<br />For this 5th book in the series, this seems to me (a professional sf/f writer) to be a flaw, whereas for the 2nd book of the series the lack was a good teaser.<br />In CEREMONY IN DEATH, Robb/Roberts has taken the subject of ceremonial magic (another subject I know write about) and  has treated it well and fairly, bringing out the massive and very important difference between Satanism and the Wiccan Religion.<br />Still, both Satanism and the Wiccan Religion are treated with the same short shrift given to the futurology.  After you finish reading CEREMONY IN DEATH you have not learned anything useful about either Satanism or Witchcraft except that they're very different.<br />But here's the very fascinating thing about these novels -- even though I began reading them for my favorite things (futurology, galactic civilization, a touch of the occult), and it turned out these elements are barely there, I'm still looking forward to reading another one.<br />I think it's because I keep hoping we'll meet some real aliens -- a non-human detective that Eve Dallas would have a hard time making friends with, or an interstellar business situation Roarke would have to sprain his brain to understand and fight to get Eve to accept. But of course, that's what I write, not what J. D.

Robb title I've read, and yes it's the second in the \\"In Death\\" series.<br />Didn't matter -- it's a gripping, absorbing, riveting read even when you jump into the middle of the series.  I'm sure I'd still enjoy reading the prequel.<br />But that fact alone - that the mystery and character relationships \\"work\\" whether you've read the previous book or not - makes this series eligible to become a TV series like Murder She Wrote.<br />And there's more.  Nora Roberts has sketched her world as being in 2058 and beyond, and has said without showing that interstellar travel exists, interstellar business exists.  Presumably nonhuman civilizations must exist too because there's no way we could invent an interstellar drive and create major businesses out there in a mere 55 years.<br />But Roberts has downplayed that background -- at least in this early part of the series.<br />With such a very light hand on the futurology, she has left room for the Studios to decide how big a budget this TV series would need -- and how much solid sf futurology they want to show, and how much they want to leave fuzzy so they can use cheap sets and makeup.<br />In fact, in this novel, the sf part of the background would seem to any sf reader/writer to be non-existent.  Some people might complain about that, but I thought it to be a very astute commercial move.<br />It has made me want to read more of these novels in hopes that this background will appear.  I would like to see Eve Dallas travel with Roarke to an interstellar setting and solve crimes there -- like Isaac Asimov's Caves of Steel.<br />I did note the tribute to Ayn Rand in naming Roarke, and some oblique tributes to Faye Kellerman's Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series in the family issues approached from a totally different direction -- and I found echoes of Laurel K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series that I don't think anyone else would see in Eve Dallas's spunk and obvious emotional problems from early childhood.<br />And even beyond that I see a Relationship developing between Eve Dallas and Roarke that is rare and glorious -- a sexual relationship between two people who love each other because each sees the other as admirable.<br />In real life it is rare to see a man admire a woman and love her too though women often love those they admire.  This could become a model relationship among equals, mixing romance, mystery, and sociological-sf.<br />There's only one bit of backgrounding missing in this second book that's annoying me.  There is no explanation of how it could be that a cop (or in this case several cops) are left to handle a case where they have a personal interest.  A conflict of interests like that would be more than sufficient cause to block Eve from working the case she's on.<br />There's got to be some hidden backgrounding there, major changes in the law, major changes in oversight and checks-and-balances due to the use of computers and databases, and maybe due to the influence of non-humans from the galactic civilization that's lurking beyond the edges of perception here.<br />I will want to read the rest of this series as I can lay my hands on them, and I'm already recommending it to readers of my own novels.arly childhood.    <br />And even beyond that I see a Relationship developing between Eve Dallas and Roarke that is rare and glorious -- a sexual relationship between two people who love each other because each sees the other as admirable.  <br />In real life it is rare to see a man admire a woman and love her too though women often love those they admire.

Many people would not be able to get through it just for that.<br />The writing however is entirely competent, strong, controlled and forceful.  The author has used all the correct imagery -- carries the scenes forward with dispatch -- gives enough but not too much description and emotional interaction.<br />The subject matter is -- well, it's part of this Dark Ages series and if you like this kind of thing, this has to be a winner of a novel.  It is however, very very dark.<br />The protagonist, Zoe, is a vampire who has seen her sire murdered by a religious fanatic whose order stands against vampires on principle -- nevermind THIS vampire sire made beautiful things and that there are some vampire sects that don't always kill when they take blood.  This religious sect murders all vampires without a second thought.<br />So Zoe sets off across the landscape of an alternate 13th century France to chase down and take revenge on the man who murdered her sire.<br />We join her near the end of her quest when she meets another vampire who takes responsibility for her vampire education, and she becomes attracted to him and his philosophy.<br />I won't tell you what she does when she confronts her moment of revenge -- but to get there you have to somehow decipher 283 pages of invisible print (and yes, I squinted my way through it page after page, I admit, couldn't quit until I knew) -- but all through those pages the main, repeated, obsessive subject is revenge.<br />There are other points of view given, but the story doesn't wander and the revenge theme is tightly focused through everything in the book.

The series has a tight and complex story arc.  It is not at all like the typical Mystery Series with repeating motifs, not predictable like Murder She Wrote, Perry Mason or Columbo.  If that is what you're looking to read, you will probably be disappointed.<br />But like those series, this one does capture the attention and keep one thinking.  That's why so many science fiction readers and writers like myself also devour mysteries -- they make you think.<br />But Faye Kellerman also makes you feel.  Mystery reading is usually a cerebral exercise, but this series details the pressure-cooker life that so many police officers lead.  This series makes you feel the heat.<br />The Jewish family lifestyle is not just incidental decoration in these novels.  It is always, in every book, including STREET DREAMS, integral to the thematic substance of the novel even when it doesn't figure in the plot.  I've discussed this at greater length in my review column for December 2003.  Click my name to find out more about me.<br />Now in STREET DREAMS Peter Decker has taken a promotion and has become management.  But his daughter is in uniform and in danger.  The wisdom that he has gained through all these previous novels and from his religious studies lets him guide her through the mine field.  We have watched this man mature, and now we see him passing on the tricks of the trade.<br />STREET DREAMS takes place in the aftermath of the traumas we've seen both Peter Decker and his daughter Cindy survive in previous novels.  This whole novel, with all 3 mystery plots, is all about healing trauma during a time of peace.<br />The resolutions of the 3 mysteries are completely unpredictable if you follow only the plot.  Some veteran mystery readers will have their expectations disappointed by the ending, but actually the resolutions carry the real message of this book if you follow the emotional story line instead of the plot.<br />&quot;Time Heals&quot; -- trauma can be overcome only with enough time and enough intervening events to provide a new perspective.  If you look at events from a different perspective, the same facts lead to different conclusions, different feelings.<br />The ending of STREET DREAMS succeeds magnificently in portraying the riches available only in maturity.  It is all about perspective.<br />Most enticing is the hint of what the next novel will be about.

Well, Buffy is a strong story-arc show like Babylon 5 and Dallas -- but without the (perceived) broad audience appeal of those shows.  Buffy is about a young girl who kicks [butt]-- like Nikkita -- but going for a major network.  Buffy is a series about vampires -- but it has a teen protagonist.  Parents don't want their kids watching \\"that kind of thing.\\"  (or so they believed)  The list of taboos is almost endless.<br />The genius that Havens refers to is, I think, Whedon's deliberate, pre-meditated integration of 4 distinct genres, horror, action, comedy and drama, into a single cohesive and coherent story and then finding a way to sell this package to Hollywood despite violating all those taboos.<br />Candace Haven writes in Joss Whedon The Genius Behind Buffy: \\"This integration lies at the core of Buffy's appeal, but it made the show almost impossible to desribe in a way that movie and network executives understood.  How do you sell a show that doesn't fall into a clear genre?  For this reason, the movie version of Buffy was turned into a comedy, much to Joss's dismay.  As a television show, Buffy was rejected by the major networks.  Ultimately, the fledgling WB accepted Buffy as a cross-genre show.  This acceptance was either a result of WB's vision or of its executives' inexperience.  But the reality is that it's unlikely Buffy would have been allowed to proceed with its cross-genre approach on one of the more established networks.\\"<br />But WB did let the show become established as a genre-mix, and that is quite literally changing the whole fiction industry from movies, to television -- even to books.

N. Elrod's \\"The Vampire Files\\" series and here in the \\"Anita Blake\\" series, and in a mundane detective series like Faye Kellerman's \\"Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus\\", you are getting a Babylon5 (or Dallas) style \\"story-arc\\".<br />Some readers find that confusing, distracting or diluting, while others thrive on it.  \\"Anita Blake\\" is one of those series that moves at the pace of a soap opera, with about a year's progress in each novel.<br />In the first novel, Guilty Pleasures, 1995, Anita Blake is possessed by her self-image.  One cornerstone of the identity she thinks she has is her idea of who she will or will not sleep with.<br />In Cerulean Sins, we struggle with Anita through a collapse of that entire cornerstone of her identity.  She was so sure of herself. She was willing to die or to kill rather than do what she's doing in this novel.<br />Why is she doing this? Because over the course of these novels, Anita has acquired aspects of the magical creatures she's been dealing with -- vampires, werewolves and were-cats.  She has not become vampire or were-anything.  But she has these traits magically rooted into her identity, and that magic is forcing a change in her identity.<br />Now, in Cerulean Sins, she is a victim of a kind of sexual esurience as powerful as the vampire's bloodlust.  If she fails to have sex, she will go mad with it and force herself on someone -- possibly on someone she cares for or someone she hates.  She will have no conscious choice.<br />The very thing we originally marveled at in her character -- her absolute refusal to be anyone's or anything's victim -- is gone.  She is a victim of her own esurience for sex.  Worse.  This esurience has been forced upon her -- not exactly against her will, but still forced on her.<br />She is helpless against the results of the choices she has made.  Karmically, she has come to exactly the place she was headed to in Guilty Pleasures.<br />The sense of \\"confusion\\" and the difficulty in following the plot that some readers have had stems from the way Anita's internal loosing-battle has left her essential character in tattered shreds.  Anita is \\"confused\\" so we are confused.  Anita can't \\"follow\\" her own life, so we can't follow the plot.<br />Anita was a \\"winner\\" -- she's \\"won\\" every physical battle in all these books.  But with each win, she's lost something of \\"herself.\\"  And in this book, she's more loser than winner, very much aware that each win is an irretrievable loss.  She is on the edge of despair.  Considering who she used to be, that is massively confusing.<br />The background of this series is \\"fantastic\\" -- vampires with civil rights, werewolves who teach high school, weretigers, necromancy -- all of it is so \\"unreal\\".  Therefore the psychology of the characters must be impeccably \\"real\\" to the reader so that the fantastic will seem plausible.<br />The classic test for whether a novel is science fiction (or fantasy) or not is whether you still have a story when you remove the \\"science\\".  The \\"science\\" in the Anita Blake series is psychology.  Psychology is the core science behind all magick, as Dion Fortune and Marion Zimmer Bradley describe it.<br />If you remove the psychology from the \\"Anita Blake\\" series, or from P. N. Elrod's \\"The Vampire Files\\" series, you no longer have a story.  Therefore, these series are in fact Occult Fantasy -- just like Buffy The Vampire Slayer.<br />If you can't follow the psychology, you won't find any story here that you can get your ahem teeth into.<br />Live Long and Prosper,<br />Jacqueline Lichtenberg<br />...This esurience has been forced upon her -- not exactly against her will, but still forced on her.  <br />She is helpless against the results of the choices she has made.

Each novel has a whole adventure story in it involving new people we've never met before, their problems, and eventually a resolution of their problems.<br />But meanwhile, within each novel, Jack Fleming struggles to become a \\"better\\" vampire -- when he's not even sure what it means to be a vampire. He has problems that resolve at the end of the novel into even worse problems yet to come.<br />Charles Escott, Jack's human partner, struggles to keep his private investigating business going despite Chicago's gangsters and the depression.<br />Together, they are telling us a tale of two people assimilating trauma and overcoming it.  All right, those of you who've read my vampire novels like Those of My Blood know that's what I write, so it's no surprise it's what I prefer to read.<br />Charles Escott has had his psyche reamed and re-arranged by events -- from the first book where a vampire walks into his office in dire need of blood, to his Dark Sleep where he must confront his past.  And Jack wakes up murdered and now a vampire, and must confront the implications of his hypnotic powers and his bloodlust.  Every time he thinks he has it all together and stabilized, another case comes along and he learns he really has no clue what being a vampire is all about.<br />In COLD STREETS - we go with Jack to a whole new level of bloodlust -- learning, feeling, and knowing what it means when a vampire has all his blood drained out of him.  Is there anything he won't do to replenish himself?  And how can he live with it afterwards?  Will his human friends stand by him?  Do they know how to administer psychiatric therapy to a nearly catatonic vampire?<br />It seems to me this series is very much like the TV Series Magnum P.I.  -- with Jack Flemming as Magnum and Charles Escott as Higgins.  Instead of being set in Hawaii, it's in 1930's Chicago, and instead of being a caretaker of a large house, Charles is the owner of the house and the private eye.  But their relationship is very similar.<br />In COLD STREETS we've come to 1938.  I keep wondering what's going to happen when the war comes to America.  Will Jack enlist?  Will they draft him?  Will he dodge the draft and go overseas by himself on his own mission?  After all, Charles' family and friends in England are going to need help.<br />I do hope P. N. Elrod keeps writing these novels.  I'm dying to see what she plans to have happen next.  I guarantee it won't be what I would write -- but I won't be able to put it down once I get my hands on the next book.<br />Live Long and Prosper,<br />Jacqueline Lichtenberg<br />...nd the private eye.

US	53030638	R1MEI0O1HK23UB	0446529818	274633509	Night Blooming	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	St. Germain - an acquired - ahem - taste ...	This is one of the most popular vampire series on the market - and it's very existence flies in the face of common editorial wisdom. I know because I've sold a number of novels, including a vampire romance coming out in 2003, Those of My Blood, and the vampire related novels of Sime Gen such as The Unity Trilogy ASIN 1592220037.<br />Most professional editors will tell you that if you want to sell a book to an editor, you can't mix your genres. And if the publisher has any hope of selling to a wide audience, you really really must never ever mix genres.<br />Well, The Chronicles of Saint-Germain are Vampire-Romance-Historical-Feminist psycho-drama, as Those of My Blood and Sime Gen are also mixed genre.<br />Yarbro has blended the twenty-first century's terse style with that antique style of words for their own sake, images described for 10 pages in paragraphs two pages long, words and words and words that just ripple across the senses for the sake of evocation of strange places in the minds of those who have never been 20 miles from their birthplace and never met anyone they haven't known all their lives. Yarbro evokes that wordy style without a spare word anywhere.<br />Relying on the reader's modern experience, Yarbro transports us to \\"there and then\\" by capturing the attitudes and ideas, the viewpoints of those who lived in such a world.<br />These novels have no action. Even when the characters are running for their lives, there's nothing resembling the kind of \\"action\\" you see on tv or in films.<br />But you know what? That's exactly why I love them! How refreshing! A real, complex, deep, rich story told without depending on fight scenes the way \\"Walker, Texas Ranger\\" does. Yarbro uses plenty of danger, threats that materialize, angst,and conflict to give us insights into how our culture has become what it is today.<br />I've done a long review of Night Blooming in my review column focusing on how perfectly the story of Gynethe Mehaut, a woman who is a totally passive victim of her life, time and circumstances reveals the full complexity of the definition of Enemy. She's an albino raised by Nuns, and has accepted a life of nothing but penitential prayer. Then the Church investigates why her hands bleed with stigmata reminiscent of Christ's wounds. She is sent from convent to convent and eventually to Charlemagne's court.<br />She has solid emotional defenses against the life she's caught in -- until Saint Germain introduces her to the delights of the body. At one point, he uses a length of silk to pleasure her -- and offers her entre into his \\"life.\\" Shortly after that, she's tortured. It seemed to me that because he broke down her inner defenses, the torture was hundreds of times worse for her than it would have been.<br /> For the torture scenes alone, Night Blooming is a stunning achievement of the writer's craft. But aside from that, the book reveals the full meaning of the casual references sprinkled in some of the other St. Germain novels about the time Saint Germain was at Charlemagne's court.<br />If this is your first Saint Germain novel, I don't think you'll be able to rest without reading the others. Like watching just one episode of Forever Knight - it leaves you tantalized by so many questions.<br />Live Long and Prosper,<br />Jacqueline Lichtenbergtotally passive victim of her life, time and circumstances reveals the full complexity of the definition of Enemy.

Norton allowed me (and that's a story all by itself) to add a vampire to the Witch World.  That is one singular honor - but of course he had to be a \\"good guy\\" vampire.<br />After I wrote that story, the question just gnawed at me - what had this vampire done to merit such a cushy existence on the Witch World?<br />When Galaxy Magazine asked for short stories I found myself writing \\"Vampire's Fast\\" and \\"True Death\\" -- two stories which were published in the magazine and are now posted online for free reading on simegen dot com. The search engine should turn them up, but if you can't find them, email me.  If you read those stories, you will want to buy HEAVEN AND HELL, so you'd better order it first, then go read.<br />But I still hadn't finished the tale of how it came to be that this vampire merited life on the Witch World where he can walk in sunlight -- and I had never expected to have to come up with a humorous installment!  A funny vampire????  And so was created \\"Vampire's Friend\\" by Jacqueline Lichtenberg -- another reviewer here has the story attribution wrong.<br />Well, the vampire isn't funny here - and he does have some harrowing things to face.  However, the situation is (to me) hilarious.  The Friend of this Vampire happens to be an Angel - one of God's Messengers who runs up and down Jacob's Ladder from Heaven to Earth.<br />On Yom Kippur, he falls off Jacob's Ladder and lands next to the garbage can in the alley beside the human's house knocked out cold - the human who is the friend of this vampire. The human who is a reform Jew on his (very few) religious days.  Still, he picks up the limp Angel and carries him inside to tend to him.<br />For a long time now, this human has been estranged from the vampire - trying to make it on his own after living the adventurous life saving the vampire from horrors and helping the vampire do away with some really nasty people who dust vampires in the sunlight.<br />The very last thing on earth he wants to do is phone the vampire and ask for help.  But what would you do if you had an unconscious Angel of the Lord lying on your bed?<br />I never imagined when I started writing the story that a Vampire, an Angel and a Reform Jew would be breaking into an Orthodox Synagogue in the dead of night on Yom Kippur.<br />And this isn't the funniest story in this collection!<br />Live Long and Prosper,<br />Jacqueline Lichtenberg<br />ambrovzeor@aol.comn who is the friend of this vampire.

I saw an interview with Patrick Halley on the Fox News O'Reilly Factor and Halley convinced me to read this book -- just by being needled by O'Reilly.<br />He's an undistinguished seeming man -- could be a Secret Service Agent and blend into the crowd.<br />His voice has an even timbre, and his eyes are steady and true. He wasn't nervous - showed every sign of being an experienced public speaker.<br />I believed every word he said - and it wasn't really much more than you've read in the cover blurb or the amazon reviews above.  It wasn't just that he said he first signed on to be Hillary's front man because she's (quoting here from his own words in that interview - which I scribbled down as he spoke) \\"really different.\\"  It was the way he said it.  Matter of fact.  Not really trying to convince you that she's \\"different\\" -- but explaining why he ditched his whole life to go on the road with a political figure knowing full well what he was getting into.  He wouldn't have done that for most any other political figure.  But Hillary wasn't like the others -and after one small taste of what it would be like working for Hillary, he wanted to work for her.<br />Now, personally, I have little use for Hillary. As a writer, both fiction (put my name into the amazon search slot to see a list)and nonfiction (Biblical Tarot and Star Trek Lives! also available here), I have listened to her speeches and watched her delivery.  She presents herself as I would present a character of mine that I didn't want anyone to believe.<br />So I watched this interview with Halley very, very closely.  I have never seen anyone else say such positive things about Hillary in such a convincing way. Living in New York, I did see a lot of Hillary - and a lot of coverage on her.  What Halley was seeing was very different from what I had seen.<br />You could read the book a dozen times and still not be convinced the impression Halley says he had gotten of her is true -- after all, anyone can type words onto paper, craft and hone them until they seem sincere.  Halley could just be looking for another job -- or he might have been paid to say nice things about Hillary because nobody else wants to. But I was convinced he meant it.<br />He might be wrong, but I think he believed every word.<br />When probed about Hillary's response to the eruption of scandal, Halley said, \\"She's a very strong person (...) she realized it was important to carry on with the Clinton Agenda.\\"<br />He saw her as committed to Bill and Bill to her.<br />It didn't sound like a coverup to me.<br />Asked about how he could guarantee the crowds the press wanted to see at Hillary's appearances, -- did he pay people to show up and hold signs?  Halley said that he never paid people to show up and hold signs, but he did pay for the buses.<br />He went out of his way to make the point that the bussed in crowd was there mostly for the convenience of the press -- so they'd be sure they could get their shot and make their deadlines.<br />He said that the Press is the prism through which people are viewed, and he seemed to consider that it was his job to give them a clear view of Hillary to pass on to the Nation.<br />When asked at the end of the interview if she will run for the Presidency, he answered with perfect politician's aplomb that he hopes she will run.<br />That was the only point where I felt there was some more to be said that he wasn't saying.<br />Read this book -- if she plans to run as we all expect she does, this book will be the first advance campaign gambit.<br />People should also read this book if they don't yet know the difference between what a candidate says from the podium and what is really happening.  If you don't understand politics as show-business (something I learned about while traveling to collect material for Star Trek Lives!) you really need to read this book.<br />If you already understand what politics really is, and politicians never fool you, then you don't have toread this book, but you should remember that Halley - who worked with Hillary under the most trying circumstances, thinks she is a steady and strong person.<br />What would she have done if she were sitting in the Oval Office when the Twin Towers came down?<br />I think that's the question this book is giving you the material to answer for yourself.<br />Live Long and Prosper,<br />Jacqueline Lichtenbergver fool you, then you don't have to read this book, but you should remember that Halley - who worked with Hillary under the most trying circumstances, thinks she is a steady and strong person.  <br />What would she have done if she were sitting in the Oval Office when the Twin Towers came down?  <br />I think that's the question this book is giving you the material to answer for yourself.  <br />Live Long and Prosper,<BR>Jacqueline Lichtenberg	2002-09-12

Garreth Mikaelian is a fascinatingly different vampire, and maybe the most exciting one of all.<br />He lives on bottled blood, like most of the vampires I like  (Forever Knight etc) and write about (Those of My Blood, Dreamspy -- or even my fantasy vampire, Dorian St. James in the anthology Heaven and Hell from Speculation Press.)  But what makes him realistic for me and thus different is the way his ex-partner and family accepts what he is.<br />It's Garreth who has trouble accepting his human friends' acceptance.  His ex-partner's wife is especially interesting for her expertise with the I-Ching and Garreth's attitude toward her pronouncements.<br />Meanwhile Garreth is acquiring a new family - a vampire family.<br />This novel, Blood Games, takes us through a necessary transition phase in Garreth's existence, and it's a page turner with a complex multi-leveled plot and rich adult themes.<br />At the start, Garreth is settled into a stable, somewhat fulfilling and almost happy life.  Nothing has happened for years now as he works in the Sheriff's dept. in a small town and becomes well known and trusted.  Once again, Lee Killough paints us a picture of a normal person who happens to be a vampire.  You can easily picture yourself in his position.<br />But by the nature of his condition, it can't last.  And here in this book is the beginning of change.<br />The plot is all about chasing a serial killer or three who seem perhaps to be vampires (or think they are).  You aren't really sure about what Garreth is chasing until the end -- and neither is he.<br />He shows us once again that despite being a vampire, he's a cop.  It's what he's always been - it's what he wants to be.<br />And he's still able to use his original identity, but in this novel, he's facing the fact that he must soon move on. And that's the real conflict in this novel - the real developmental tension for these characters -- change.  The resistance to change, the confrontation with necessity, the anguished acceptance of change, and the whole new situation that results at the end of the novel -- is all about change.<br />The new situation at the ending puts me in mind of Fred Saberhagen's FRIEND OF THE FAMILY - the vampire that watches over generations of a human family.<br />I'm hoping that Lee will carry on Garreth's tale and let us meet up with his family's descendents as he watches over them.<br />But this book leaves us with a twist.

I was just a kid, and at that time hadn't really decided I would be a professional writer.<br />But I loved the book.  I don't write this particular style, true, but I enjoy reading it.  And I enjoyed it more as a kid.<br />As a budding writer, this book taught me the value of vivid characters who behave in a consistent manner.<br />I learned one of Robert A. Heinlein's rules from this book -- that what a writer is selling is entertainment.  That your work competes for the book-buyers beer money. Later, when I saw R.A.H. articulate that rule, I understood what he was talking about.<br />For myself, I slowly hatched the ambition to grow up to give other people the kind of sheer, soul-satisfying, good READ that Nelson S. Bond gave to me.  Of course, there were many other authors that contributed to that ambition, but you know what?  I bought this book at a convention at a premium price in the 1970's - and I still have it on my treasure shelf.<br />As a professional reviewer and teacher of writing, I recommend this book for readers in the 10-16 age group -- and those mature enough to be able to enjoy a book aimed at younger readers without being embarrassed.<br />If you like Farscape, Stargate SG-1, and/or Star Trek's new ENTERPRISE -- you really should read this book.  This is their source-material.<br />Parents should read this book with an idea to judging at what age their own children would be able to appreciate it. But they'll be asking you what you're laughing at, you'll be having such a howling good time reading.<br />This kind of writing is timeless and can appeal to readers of all ages, if they're mature enough to enjoy for the sake of enjoying.  And this is the kind of book no home sf/f library should be without.<br />Live Long and Prosper,<br />Jacqueline Lichtenberg	2002-08-01
US	53030638	RLPYCVJMVW6D5	0916360520	19774386	ASTROLOGY, A COSMIC SCIENCE-op	Books	5	63	65	N	N	Strewn With Hidden Gems Of Wisdom	The strength of this book is the deep, rich context surrounding each topic. But for many, that would be its weakness.<br />I use it as a reference book - when I'm stumped by a chart, I just page through this book looking for new associations to break the logjam in my mind. But in truth, this is a book to read cover-to-cover, pasting in post-it-notes to mark the bits and pieces of unrelated but illuminating wisdom tossed into various discussions.<br />For example, in one very illuminating section of this book, Hickey discusses each of the signs as it manifests as the Ascendant - then under each sign as the Ascendant, she discusses each of the signs that would be on the other House Cusps if there are no interceptions, or if you use equal-house methods.<br />She shows you how the rising sign synthesizes with the signs on each of the cusps - to create some of the characteristics of people with that sign rising, and to color the house involved. This explains WHY a particular ascendant tends to produce people who behave a particular way.<br />The book is worth its price for that section alone -- if you're willing to just sit for a couple of hours and read all the rising signs, one section after the other. The faster you read it, the more sense it makes. The section is laid out very systematically, and that system reveals vistas of astrological truths in and of itself.<br />However, at random throughout the section, a few sentences, \\"throw away dialog,\\" and offhand allusions are tossed into other topics to point you to bits of knowledge about how astrology works and what it's actually for. These bits are not taken up anywhere else in the book, not assembled, not set into a larger context, and not indexed. They just leap out at you as if outlined in soul-fire.<br />For example: In the section devoted to Capricorn Rising, which puts Libra on the 10th, Hickey says, \\"Venus's sign in Saturn's house is often loving for the sake of expediency. This is not true of the more evolved individual. Students often ask the question, \\"How can one tell the evolvement of an individual in the chart?\\" Character is shown by the signs in which the planets are placed. Planets in their sign of exaltation and in the signs they rule are indications of an evolved consciousness. Also the higher-octave planets -- Neptune, Uranus, Pluto, and Jupiter -- in the first, fourth, seventh, or tenth house show that the individual has had much soul experience in other lifetimes\\".<br />You see? For that alone, this is worth the cover price, and there are lots and lots of those throughout the whole book.<br />Maybe these bits of wisdom aren't actually true. But as you go, \\"Aha!\\" and pull out a dozen charts of people you know well to check out Hickey's theory, you learn vast amounts more about astrology than you ever would have without investigating that theory.<br />I came to amazon today looking for links to used copies of Hickey's book and was delighted to find it in print. I had been paging through this book at random the other day and it gave me a flash of inspiration. I used that insight to write two columns for my sf/f review column called ReReadable Books. Hickey had connected several sf novels for me, using the 7th House, the 6 of Swords and how they generate the art of storycraft. I'm a professional sf author, and teach writing online, and I needed to write a handout for the Writing Workshop at the World Science Fiction Convention. Before I leafed through Hickey's book, I had no clue in my mind what I could offer at that Workshop. Then I produced a 14 page essay which will probably be the October and November installments of my column.<br />So, the strength of this book lies in the context surrounding the facts, a context which assembles random bits of the universe in which you live into a pattern that makes sense. But that context material is so randomly placed - so \\"stream of consciousness\\" in the style of Hickey's writing that it's impossible to use this book just to find out, say, the signature of the advanced soul.<br />You'd never find it if you searched the index or the table of contents. You have to read the entire book. (stock up on post-its).<br />And if you like this style of astrology (with a karmic and spiritual bent) - you really need Hickey's book on PLUTO as MINERVA, and all about WISDOM. There's a lot in that book I don't agree with - but it surely makes you think.<br />Live Long and Prosper,<br />Jacqueline Lichtenberg<br />...book just to find out, say, the signature of the advanced soul. <br />You'd never find it if you searched the index or the table of contents.

The human is caught in a political trap by his Emperor -- because the Emperor is trying to force him to commit treason.  The Emperor wants this Noble's Estates, so to kick him into rebellion, the Emperor orders this very Honorable man to murder innocent civilians then accuses him of treason when he gives them quick easy deaths.<br />The alien is a kind of high nobility in his own area of the galaxy, but is here in human dominated territory, serving as First Officer on the human's ship where the human is Captain and rules an entire sector of space in the name of the Emperor.  The alien is waiting for the ripening of a revolution in his own territory and can't move until the rest of the strategy is in place back home.  So he waits.<br />The alien has an innate sense of Honor -- follows a code so strict he refuses to issue orders in his Captain's name, because it's not his own name.  If defeated in ritual combat, he will allow himself to be killed rather than making a last ditch stand as a human would.  His people consider it dishonorable not to surrender completely when defeated.  He's one of the few who understands humans don't think it dishonorable to keep fighting no matter what.<br />The alien's species has no mechanism for engaging in friendship -- this is not just cultural, but a trait of their nature.  But this particular individual is an empath, and can read human emotions -- even those he doesn't yet understand.<br />Each of the two has secrets to keep from the other -- one of which is revealed in this novel, and nearly gets them both killed.<br />Through the course of this novel, the alien gains a solid notion of what friendship means, and the human begins to understand the nature of &quot;alliance&quot; -- which is the alien's concept of their relationship.<br />They share a common goal -- avoiding war between their species -- but neither is really certain the other cherishes that goal.<br />The fate of the galaxy depends on them becoming sure.  But in this novel, things begin to get very complicated as two new characters enter the mix.<br />Both new characters are human women chosen by these two men for their attractiveness (not physical beauty -- traits of personality). They're also interested in sex (well, they are men!).<br />This novel could have failed abysmally because both main characters are at a point in their lives when they can not and must not do anything to change their intolerable situations.  They are waiting.  Strategically, that's the right thing to do.<br />Ordinarily a novel about heros who just stand around waiting, in anguish over a situation but completely unable to act to change that situation becomes very boring.<br />This novel is a thrilling, &quot;can't put it down&quot; read -- because although they can't do anything now about the real problems, their current actions are forging new options for the future.<br />The novel leaves off with a definite feeling there will be a future, and that there will be many options for them to choose from -- options we can't now foresee -- options provided by these two remarkable women who have entered the scene.  They will topple the Evil Emperor and save the Galaxy from war that could only end with humanity enslaved.<br />Or maybe not - maybe humanity will lose the war, and become enslaved, and then their task will become to save the aliens from the human's natural response to slavery -- breaking free and destroying the enslavers.  The honorable aliens would never expect that!  After all, the defeated must surrender honorably.<br />The novel is not flawless, but it's so good I didn't care, and I don't remember the nits I found that needed picking.<br />Live Longand Prosper,<br />Jacqueline Lichtenbergicking.  <br />Live Long and Prosper,<BR>Jacqueline Lichtenberg	2001-09-30

And it is exceptionally well-done of its kind.<br />TIME FUTURE has a plot that qualifies as Intimate Adventure Genre - email me for a link to the definition - because the resolution of the problem requires soul-baring emotional honesty, and not just at the moment when the Hero confronts her ex-husband who is trying to con her (maybe).<br />As with many aired Classic Star Trek episodes, and even more Star Trek fanzine stories, this novel tests the female hero to near destruction.  Since it's told in the first person, you get a &quot;Sam Spade&quot; or &quot;Anita Blake&quot; effect from the narrative, and it becomes easier to ask yourself if you could be this tough in similar circumstances.<br />I found it a page-turner and a very good read, but I suspect it may have been trimmed, condensed and cut to the bare bones because the pacing is so fast there's very little room for character-development nevermind anything as complex as Relationship.  All the key Relationships in this novel are already estabished and functioning, and they don't grow and change (much) during the novel's events.  So you don't get a dynamic Relationship driven story narrative.<br />If the Situation of defending a cut-off outpost space-station from aliens, both inside and out of the station, doesn't &quot;grab you&quot; all by itself, you won't find much to be interested in.  The author didn't have space to develop answers to the question, &quot;Why does this space station matter to me(the reader)?&quot;<br />I suspect there is room for a sequel where that question will be answered in detail, and Relationships will start to mature, so watch for this author's name.<br />Live Long and Prosper, Jacqueline LichtenbergRelationships will start to mature, so watch for this author's name.  <br />Live Long and Prosper, Jacqueline Lichtenberg	2001-08-12

Since my teens are now in their 30's, I doubt I'd have noticed this book otherwise.<br />And I would have been the poorer for it.<br />This is one of those deceptively simple books -- it is much more than it appears on the surface.<br />Most books about surviving the raising of teens into adults are about do's and don'ts -- about advice.  About how to handle common situations.<br />&quot;A Bewildered Parent's Guide&quot; is about the process of becoming the parent of a 30 year old who used to be your teenager. This is the book to read BEFORE you read the &quot;how to&quot; books.<br />It requires as much shift-change-growth on the part of the parent as it does on the part of the teen. Every time the teen changes, the parent and the parenting-style have to shift to make room for the changes in the teen.  Every time the parent changes, the teen is then forced to shift-change-become more mature.<br />This book describes that process without actually talking about it.  This book shows us in objective language that doesn't trigger fulminating emotions what that process is -- without telling.  That &quot;show don't tell&quot; is one of the keys to good writing we teach at the WorldCrafters Guild.<br />If you want to be told, choose from among any number of books on raising children.  This is the best book I've seen based on showing.<br />&quot;A Bewildered Parent's Guide&quot; describes the principles, issues, and processes behind the advice you find in other books.  It's the kind of book you'll use, then save to give to your kids when they have kids.<br />Live Long and Prosper, Jacqueline Lichtenberg	2001-06-11

This review is about the Abridged version recorded by Theodore Bikel.<br />I remember sitting on my father's lap and listening to the radio.  &quot;The Creaking Door&quot;  &quot;The Shadow&quot;  &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;  And I remember being read to, wonderful adult books with &quot;hard words.&quot;<br />Audio-only is a form of entertainment that is enjoying a Renaissance today -- perhaps because our jobs consist of staring at a computer screen all day and we want to be entertained with our eyes closed after that.  Or perhaps because we get stuck in traffic and use that time to &quot;read&quot;.  Or now, you can download some of these audio-books into your pc or palm-top, or burn the recording into a CD and take it anywhere.<br />&quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; is 4 audio tapes, 45 minutes to a side.  Each piece starts with some marvelous Medieval church chanting --and goes directly to the voice of Theodore Bikel.  Then ends with more church music.  There are no other &quot;FX&quot;.<br />On this tape, Bikel only reads -- this is not like some of the audio-books that have been recorded for Star Trek spinoff novels, where several actors play the characters, as in a radio drama, complete with sound effects.<br />This tape is a single voice - but oh, what a voice!  What a reader!  I doubt anyone else could have brought this book alive for us.  You want this tape if you loved reading the book because this reading illuminates the meaning of the story in new ways. Bikel also has a number of other books he's recorded.  Search &quot;Theodore Bikel&quot; for the page full of them.<br />Bikel reads in the First Person, as Brother William's assistant, and gives us a deep insight into the character of Brother William, the ex-Inquisitor with a mind like a scientist.  It could not possibly have been read better.<br />And I suspect the abridgement could not have been done better -- but still because this is such a long novel, with so much philosophical material in it, the condensation creates a problem the author probably winces at.<br />As a professional writer and writing teacher at simegen.com, I want to explain what happened in this abridgement, and thus perhaps help you to decide if you want to buy these tapes.<br />Some of the reviews of the novel note (either with praise or vexation) that the novel contains long passages about various Monkish orders and their philosophies and rival theologies.  Some reviews note the long passages of description, either with delight at how this transports you to the ancient world, or with frustration at how it impedes the mystery narrative. Some love the philosophy, as dense as it is, and some find it too opaque.<br />There is a reason the author supplied all this extra detail, all this discussion and background and history.  There is a reason this novel is as long as it is in print.<br />There are seven characters who die, and even more suspects.  It's a complex mystery -- no, it is 7 mystery novels in one, because from the available evidence you don't know how many crimes or criminals or accidents you might be dealing with.  Each murder requires the mystery-reader to know something of the victim's own background, and something of the backgrounds of the suspects in order for the reader to have a fair chance at guessing the solution to the mystery.<br />This is not only difficult to write, it's very difficult to read.  You must keep all the characters straight in your mind and juggle them all against an unfamiliar background.<br />The material which some readers found intrinsically fascinating and revealing and others found boring or distracting is the material which the writer designed to help the reader keep everyone straight -- and which feeds the reader the information necessary to solve the crime themselves.  And of course, some of that material is just amusing and distracting -- designed to make the reader guess wrongly at who murdered whom and why.<br />In the abridged audio version the &quot;extra&quot; material that contains the philosophy, backgrounds of the various orders, and intricate descriptions had to be condensed or deleted.  It is whittled to the barest bones.<br />The result is too many characters crammed too closely together, without thinking or breathing space, and without context.  Well, no not wholly without context.  The bare essentials are still there - the abridgement is well done -- it's still possible to solve the mystery before the detective does.  And Bikel's reading adds nuance and depth beyond the mere words. I cried over the library burning, even though I knew it was coming.<br />But to keep the characters and their names straight, juggle the mystery clues in your head, and follow the philosophy -- well, it takes some concentration.<br />But, hey, you can do it with your sore eyes closed.<br />Yes, this is the kind of audio-book to use for that hour before bedtime when you'd love to read yourself to sleep, but just can't make your eyes focus anymore. But you won't fall asleep to Bikel's reading.  He makes every word a 'can't put it down' experience. Then having been transported away from your everyday cares, you'll be ready to sleep.<br />I don't think these tapes are the best choice for &quot;reading&quot; while driving.  You can't afford to miss any of the words or you'll lose track of the story and never understand the solution to the mystery.<br />But if you're on a long cross-country drive, this is the right book to take into a motel with your portable tape player.  You won't go to sleep with that white-line unrolling behind your eyelids - you'll be in a vaulted chapel with sunlight streaming through stained glass windows and monks chanting devoutly while plotting murder.  You'll wake up gnawing on the problem the mystery poses and have something to think about while driving the next day, knowing you have another installment for the evening.<br />The 8 45-minute sides are enough to take you from New York to Los Angeles without breaking the speed limit.<br />Live Long and Prosper, Jacqueline Lichtenbergemselves.

This one reads like a good, solid, science fiction novel or one of the very, very best Fantasy novels.  The reader never gets jarred out of the story by dischordant or anachronistic details -- if there were any I missed them.<br />I did notice one item that bothered me as I read -- a forest dwelling tribe of nomads who casually bake bread for their celebrations.  Turned out that was a plant by the author designed to foreshadow a discovery we will make in a later volume about that tribe of nomads, where they came from and how they got to be forest nomads. Some of it is hinted at in this volume -- just enough to whet the curiosity.<br />Beyond that I found nothing amiss anywhere -- and I have never read a book published and touted as a romance that was so solid -not even Kay Kenyon's books (which are outstanding!).<br />Other finely crafted elements in this novel are the characterizations and the conflicts among the characters which drive the characters to grow and change and develop.  Most romances have only one or two things the characters learn -- fairly simplistic lessons of life.  These characters, however, are fraught with criss-crossing lines of conflict that fairly seethe with possibilities.<br />For example, in Chapter 4, the Hero is told about the ESP talented woman he must deal with:<br />--------------  &quot;Her adoptive parents were violently prejudiced against Nomads and were determined to 'save' her from the 'flaws' in her nature.  She grew up so indoctrinated with the belief that her people are evil, immoral animals that she would have suppressed her innate abilities completely if Nature hadn't insisted otherwise.&quot;<br />  Randrik knew enough about Nomads to understand.  all of them had Power, and it manifested the moment they reached puberty no matter how hard someone might try to prevent it. What he didn't know -- and was no longer sure he wanted to know -- was what any of it had to do with him.  -------------<br />Now isn't that a choice set of &quot;Famous Last Words?&quot;  Here is the portrait of a man backing up into a beartrap of monumental proportions.<br />So if you've read some e-books before that proved not to be worth their price -- screw up your courage and try this novel.er how hard someone might try to prevent it.

It's a reference book, one that will soon be bristling with post-it notes.<br />This edition is particularly valuable because it's printed in nice large print on very good paper, with sturdy (though paperback) binding.  The printing is crisp, so the illustrations, woodcuts, line-drawings, and sigils and Magical Seals, are sharp enough to read so you can copy them in every detail.<br />The numerous color plates are on heavy foolscap, bright, shiny and true-color.<br />As for the content -- The Tree of Life is to Magick as the Periodic Table is to Chemistry.<br />Where did I get that idea?  Well, I'm a chemist &amp; sf/f writer who got so &quot;into&quot; Tarot I wrote a book called &quot;The Biblical Tarot: Never Cross a Palm With Silver&quot; which you can buy on amazon.com, and have more to write in that series.  Over the 25 years prior to writing that book, I taught Tarot.<br />And I discovered that I could lecture for three hours and at the end ask the students to define &quot;Tree of Life&quot; and they had no clue. So I hit on this way of explaining it -- by relating the function of the Tree of Life in the study of Torah and Magick to the function of the Periodic Table in the study of Science.<br />Chemistry being a branch of alchemy (as science is a branch of Magick) people can usually see immediately that the Periodic Table (that underlies all science) must be a branch or subset of something larger that tabulates the components of Magick. That something larger is the Tree of Life -- the Bible itself.<br />The link between Tarot and the Bible is the Tree of Life.  &quot;Etz Haim&quot; is an appelation of the Torah which is the first Five Books of Moses.  In other words, the Bible is the Tree of Life to us, and as a tree's sap nourishes the leaves, so the Tree of Life brings us (the leaves) the pure Energy of the Eternal.<br />If you're just starting to learn Cabbalah and want to start with Regardie, there are several things to take into account before you decide to buy this book or before you read it first.<br />Regardie was a member of the Golden Dawn -- a Secret Magickal society in England around the turn of the 20th Century.  Dion Fortune and Alistair Crowley were also members -- they all knew each other.  Regardie admired Crowley.<br />Crowley betrayed his oath and broke the Group Mind of that Secret Society.  Then Crowley taught Magick in a way that would tend to unleash the power and Will of any hapless initiate -- without the safeguards many practitioners deem necessary. Then he died a very sick and ugly death -- many say because of his practices. Hence he has become connected with Black Magick which always destroys the practitioner -- and I personally do not recommend any beginner get anywhere near any of Crowley's books, or his Tarot Deck, or any of his desciples.<br />And Regardie is connected to Crowley.<br />That said, this book is still a piece of scholarship that belongs on the reference shelf of a wide variety of professionals, not just those interested in Magick.<br />It is a writer's handbook (I also teach writing online) of Magick and the alleged connections with &quot;Egypt&quot; -- some of which are valid and actually refer to the real historical Biblical Egypt (at least as the British conceptualized it around 1900 or so.  In the early 20th Century, much of what we think of as archeology was done by wealthy amateurs not by scholars.  So they missed a few points here and there).<br />Regardie's book is a reference for the Magickal concept of how the Universe is structured.  People writing stories set in Medieval times need this book -- it's a whole different mindset than we are used to.  If you want your fictional characters to seem real, they need to think like Regardie, not like you and me. (If a character thinks like a real Medieval person, no 21st century reader would understand him.)<br />The book contains extensive discourses on Theurgy and Abremalin the Mage, and a wide range of topics -- and it even touches briefly on the Tree of Life used as a Pagan focus for ceremonial and meditation.<br />There are diagrams of the Tree Glyph in color and some line diagrams that show the relationships among the parts of the Tree.<br />In other words, this book -- like much Golden Dawn literature -- ranges far and wide among the most pagan and most monotheistic of Earth's religious traditions, as if there were in fact no difference among them.<br />This may reveal to you an eclectic and higher Truth -- or it may only seem philosophically confused beyond redemption.  But taken within the Golden Dawn's historical and social context, it makes perfect sense.<br />There at the turn of the century when the wealthy of England were holding Seances led by famous Mediums, it was socially unacceptable but yet absolutely necessary to explore The Unseen.  In that England, the Church of England held sway absolutely.<br />Therefore, these well educated and well to do people banded together to try to break the chokehold on their subconscious minds that Christianity had gotten.  They became convinced they were not Christians.<br />Yet, if you are not Christian, you can read what they have written and see how very, very Christian their brand of Paganism was.  Their denial of Christianity was strident and very strained, and nowhere is that more evident than in Dion Fortune's (wonderful and highly recommended) books and in Regardie's writings -- &quot;The Tree of Life, An Illustrated Study in Magic&quot; being a good case in point.<br />Altogether this is an edition well worth it's cover price if you are at the right point in your studies or need a reference for the anti-Christian or for the mindset of the Pagan just being converted to Christianity.<br />If you're looking for a place to start studying the real Tree of Life and Cabbalah, you might do better to visit the School of Philosophy in the WorldCrafters Guild at simegen.com and explore some of those links first.nsive discourses on Theurgy and Abremalin the Mage, and a wide range of topics -- and it even touches briefly on the Tree of Life used as a Pagan focus for ceremonial and meditation.<br />There are diagrams of the Tree Glyph in color and some line diagrams that show the relationships among the parts of the Tree.  <br />In other words, this book -- like much Golden Dawn literature -- ranges far and wide among the most pagan and most monotheistic of Earth's religious traditions, as if there were in fact no difference among them.  <br />This may reveal to you an eclectic and higher Truth -- or it may only seem philosophically confused beyond redemption.

As  a teacher of Tarot from a Cabbalistic perspective, I have worked with a wide variety of meditation techniques, and I find the kundalini/chakra model very effective and definitely worth learning.<br />The Chakras are laid out along the human body in a pattern very close to the pattern used by the classical Tree of Life Glyph.  For more on that see my review of Israel Regardie's &quot;The Tree of Life, an Illustrated Study in Magic&quot; here on ....<br />Kundalini is defined in this book as spiritual energy that rises through the seven Centers called Chakras.  Activating each chakra up the spine in turn energizes different parts of a person.<br />For example, Kundalini rises from the First Chakra at the root of the spine, to the Third which awakens an awareness of the paranormal where one gains first hand knowledge of the higher realms through out of body experiences or nightly dreams.<br />Between the 6th and 7th chakras, Kundalini triggers a flowing toward perfect health.<br />Going higher than that, people may become so absorbed with the inner realms they leave the material world behind for Self-realization.<br />This state of mind that can be created by the practices that raise Kundalini allows one to see the similarities underlying all religions.<br />And you don't have to be Hindi to do this.  This little book would be a good place to start learning about it -- but I would definitely advise you to explore much more widely before embarking on any practice involving Kundalini.  It can be very dangerous to your psychological health, or it can heal ills that as yet modern science can't even define.re embarking on any practice involving Kundalini.

I was trolling amazon fishing for good books for the students in our writing school, WorldCrafters Guild at simegen.com, when I found the 'forthcoming' page for Romance.<br />As it happened, our Romance Reviews columnist at simegen.com, Darlene Kendall, was on AIM -- so I hailed her and asked for a recommendation from amazon's forthcoming page by pasting the link into AIM. As a reviewer, Darlene often gets books before they're published, so she had already read these books.<br />She chose BACK IN BABY'S ARMS, keyboarding to me, &quot;BACK IN BABY'S ARMS gives readers a wonderful heroine who grows into the perfect match for such a delicious hero.&quot;<br />Now, I do love stories about characters who learn emotional lessons and grow because of the events in the book.<br />But I tell you -- this new online world is just what an avid reader needs -- not Instant Messages -- INSTANT RECOMMENDATIONS on next month's books!	2000-12-26

Yes, they're simplistic, and yes they're out of date, and yes the new editions have lost something in translation, BUT - Lewi's approach can convince your friends you are not wasting your time fooling around with this stuff.<br />The amazing thing about these two books is that, despite the simplifications, they produce astonishingly accurate results.<br />I have just used Lewi's explanation of the Saturn Cycle which is presented in ASTROLOGY FOR THE MILLIONS in an essay &quot;Astrology for Writers&quot; on simegen.com aimed at convincing writing students to explore the potentials of this powerful tool in fiction writing.  Thirty years, and I can't put this book down.  I'm glad I bought it in hardcover to begin with!<br />I still have the charts I made out thirty years ago, following the directions in the book and using the chart forms the book provides for spotting the crucial years when transits co-incide.  The results match the results of the Matrix Software I currently use, but I STILL read those charts on myself.<br />I recommend all the Grant Lewi titles to my writing students and my astrology students, but especially to those who are both.	2000-10-27

By reading a few paragraphs of his work, you can probably decide if his approach is for you.<br />As a mystic who is also a science fiction writer trained in Chemistry, I find that Tyl modernizes astrology by correlating and re-interpreting the Ancient Wisdom in terms of what modern science has discovered about the human psyche, personality development process, and the scars left by even the most benign upbringing.  In the Tyl approach, nature, nurture and karma come together into a picture of the whole person, and the wholeness of Life as an ongoing developmental process.<br />ASTROLOGICAL TIMING OF CRITICAL ILLNESS is not a book that can be easily read and understood outside the context of Tyl's basic approach.  This one is an advanced book for the student of Tyl's version of astrology.  It would seem opaque even to an accomplished practicing professional astrologer if that astrologer were steeped in a different set of assumptions about Life and where astrology can fit into Life.<br />If your skills aren't up to comprehending an advanced astrology textbook on an extremely specialized branch of astrology, buy this book and put it away on your top shelf.  You'll get to it eventually, and it could save someone's life.  So many of Tyl's books are out of print, I wouldn't let the chance to stock this one go by.<br />In the meantime, read it quickly for the definition of the quindecile aspect and the way Pluto tends to show up as a harbinger of a health-challenge.  Then notice those elements in the charts you analyze, take notes, track your clients, and see if these clues help you help them.  If so, sit down one weekend and really read this book cover to cover.<br />To get the most out of this book you'll probably need to follow the footnotes that refer to many of Tyl's other works -- on midpoints, developmental deficit and the moon's nodes, and especially on the Pluto involvement in extreme Prominence and fame (which is treated in Synthesis &amp; Counseling in Astrology : The Professional Manual by Noel Tyl ).<br />Most of Tyl's life work in astrology consists of contributions which are just the start of a line of research that will have to be carried out by teams with serious funding at their disposal. Some enterprising medical student may one day use this book to design a project and apply for a research grant.<br />Even if you don't like or subscribe to Tyl's approach, you should come to understand his theories so you'll understand that research when it's published.

He's a &quot;good interview,&quot; articulate and well spoken, obviously in full and complete mastery of his subject.  And he has hit on a thesis that is a headline-grabber, and thus is getting him on television where he can use those traits to sell books.<br />As president of a new startup dot-com, (simegen), running an online writing school (to teach people to sell books they write) using the advertising supported model to run the dot-com, (truly a venture in capitalism) I have a very personal, vested interest in averting the economic power-dive Mandel predicts.<br />In two years of operation we've already changed our business model twice and seen our revenue sources shift alarmingly, and suffer from a shortage of tech skilled people.  So from the inside, I can say that Mandel has done his research well.<br />From the outside, as a professional science fiction writer, with over 40 years of futurology behind me, I have to say that his predictions leave out too many vital factors.<br />Human nature is driving the dot-com mania -- it's the human need to communicate.  It drove the printing-press revolution, the building of railroads, then the automobile, the telephone, and now the internet.<br />If you don't understand the businessman's term &quot;venture capital&quot; you really should read Mandel's book.  If you own any mutual funds with tech investments, you should read this book. If you work in any industry where your job would be at risk if business had to abandon the internet build-out, (as it well might) you must read this book.<br />Don't discount what Mandel is saying -- it could happen.  But - understand that this book is a piece of journalism like Alvin Toffler's FUTURE SHOCK or my own STAR TREK LIVES!.<br />There is a reason that journalists write books like this.  If you understand that reason, you will understand what factors they leave out of their arguments, and what factors they emphasize, and why. You'll understand what editors who buy books have to do with the journalist's choices of emphasis, and what TV interviewers have to do with editorial choices. Then you can think for yourself rather than run scared before a doom-sayer, even one who's right.<br />This is a book about economics, Wall Street, and the Internet Revolution.  The &quot;Internet&quot; became a &quot;Revolution&quot; when corporations started pouring billions of dollars into it. (I remember; I was on the net before that.)<br />Why did they start pouring in those billions?  My answer is &quot;Human Nature&quot; -- having noticed how humans will sacrifice anything to gain communication with other humans, some humans see an opportunity to make a profit.  (which isn't a bad thing; it has its place after all)<br />If profiteers succeed, others notice and soon you have a gold-rush.  That's what we're seeing in the internet now -- desperate attempts to stake claims.  Some of the properties are worthless, and some are mother-loads. Which is which?<br />Ask yourself what drives a gold-rush, what brings it to a halt, and what happens after the gold-rush? Mandel is describing one possibility -- what happens when the gold-fever breaks.  If you don't remember what happened after the gold-rush in California (or Alaska), go read up on it.  Answer the question, then read Mandel's book.<br />Fifty years after the gold-rush, which families end up as the elite of the wealthy? The prospectors like you and me?  Or those who sold them tools and transportation? Once you have that firmly sorted out for yourself, then you must read this book.<br />Read this book, but not to decide if you agree or disagree, and certainly not to believe it as a prediction of the future.  Read this book as an analysis of a set of current trends.<br />If you understand those trends, you too can make a profit by reading this book -- but not if you don't understand human nature -- the need to dominate, the need tocommunicate, the need for the ascendency of me-and-mine at the &quot;Center of Things,&quot; the need for attention.<br />If you're starting a dot-com of your own, calculate on the probability that Big Business and Venture Capital will indeed abandon the mountains of the dot-coms.  But humans will still passionately seek communication.<br />Read Mandel, think about what he's saying, and construct your business to thrive in the scenario he describes, both before and after the gold-fever abates.  To figure out when the gold-fever will abate for sure, read The Roaring 2000s : Building the Wealth and Lifestyle You Desire in the Greatest Boom in History by Harry S., Jr. Dent which analyzes these trends as a function of the demographics of aging.  No one book, no one journalist, can give you the whole picture.dominate, the need to communicate, the need for the ascendency of me-and-mine at the &quot;Center of Things,&quot; the need for attention.  <br />If you're starting a dot-com of your own, calculate on the probability that Big Business and Venture Capital will indeed abandon the mountains of the dot-coms.

Suzette Haden Elgin has written a number of sf/f novels illustrating the  principles explicated in GENDERSPEAK, but here you can learn them in a  matter of a few hours reading.  As a professional sf writer as well as an  online teacher of writing, I have found her insights to apply not only to  daily interactions among people, but to the understanding of anthropology  and social speech patterns that every writer must grasp to create dialogue.<br />GENDERSPEAK and the other Verbal Self-Defense books by Elgin are lucid,  clear, easily applied manuals of how to conduct a conversation without  turning it into mortal combat for control of the agenda or power over other  people's emotions, or conversely how to turn any innocent exchange into  mortal combat at the drop of an intonation or idiom.<br />It isn't just the  verbally abused who need to read these books and take her course.  This  book is most truly vital reading for those who know no other way of dealing  with people (intimately in family interactions or in the business world)  without putting them down, undermining their self-confidence, or attempting  to dominate.<br />Each of us has a speaking style that is both ideosyncratic  and belongs to a short list of stylistic patterns which Elgin identifies.  Read this book to learn the pattern you are using, and you will gain  command enough to change that pattern and thus your destiny in life.<br />Read this book to raise your consciousness of how speech patterns mark  us as victims or abusers.  Non-native speakers of American Standard English  need to read this book.  It will solve many mysteries for you.<br />Give  this book as a gift to your friends who are not getting the promotions they  deserve on the job, or who fight agonizingly with their spouses.<br />Live  Long and Prosper, Jacqueline Lichtenberg	2000-08-11

With only  visualization, nothing will happen.  Without visualization, nothing will  happen.  Visualization must be transformed to emotion, which must power  action, then results happen.<br />The trick to applying Grabhorn's method is  to understand that the 'choice' Grabhorn says we all have to  &quot;feel&quot; certain ways is a choice made by the subconscious mind,  not the conscious.<br />The subconscious mind is &quot;programmed&quot; by  the kind of fiction we imbibe regularly -- which is why the content of our  children's TV shows is so important to who they will become in life.<br />Grabhorn's book is not so much about us, the adults, but about the  children we are raising.  Every parent should read this book and understand  what it means about the emotions their children spend most of their time  feeling -- especially while watching cartoons.<br />ambrovzeor@aol.com	2000-07-31

Actually, my full review appears in The Monthly Aspectarian in my sf review column (usually posted at [...] the May '98 issue.  However, in brief, the subject matter of this novel is near and dear to my heart and the writing style gives it that extra something that glues me to the page and fires my imagination.<br /> I also have (as those who've read my own novels know) an affinity for human/alien love stories, and this book contains one of the best I've seen in a very long time.<br /> Much of the enjoyment of this 'good read' depends on the suspense developed so don't read too many reviews before you read the book.<br /> If you like Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake novels, I think you'll probably like Katie Waitman's work -- but for entirely different reasons.  Ostensibly, they're complete opposites, but they carry much the same kind of appeal for me.

More, she's done it without any false moves.  She handles the core matters of the spiritual disciplines behind The Art with firm authority -- so you hardly notice they're there.<br /> That is the mark of the highest level craftsmanship in writing.  It's what makes for a 'good read' -- and Neason has delivered that.<br /> In addition, she has crafted a novel which embraces my favorite aspects of Duncan's character.
