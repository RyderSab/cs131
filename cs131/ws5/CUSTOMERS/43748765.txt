In 1978 the British mini-series \\"Lillie\\" ran on PBS with Oscar Wilde played by Peter Egan.  Egan's performance ranks up there with George C. Scott's in \\"Patton,\\" it was that good!  After that marvelous visual introduction to Wilde I read Richard Ellmann's \\"Oscar Wilde,\\" it was great--one of the best biographies ever.  Now McKenna's book delves into those aspects of Wilde's life that those discreet earlier accounts glossed over.  Not that I'm gay (I'm not) or even interested in poetry (I'm not), but Wilde's life is an interesting story and this explicit book fills those gaps in a graphic but non-judgemental way.	2005-06-04

The idea of a mad scientist creating a human monster was a great idea--especially in the year 1816.  However the book is boring...implausible...over-written...under-edited...and boring.  So why is is so famous?  Let's face it, today nobody would have heard of, much less read, this book if the 1931 movie hadn't made it famous; yet the book and the movie have very little in common.  So why does it get such great reviews?  Again, let's face it, the title is so famous that most people don't want to say that they don't get it.  But there's very little to get, other than what you read into it--the emperor has no clothes!  But credit to Shelley for a truly great idea.	2005-03-29

I had also felt that something was missing from all those accounts of Hitler's Germany:  Just how did he do it--what was the attraction?  This book finally  answers that question.  Hitler was a great artist, and Germany was his stage.  His art was a series of spectacles: pageantries of flags, parades, uniforms, massed formations of men, and skillful oratory--all surrounded by searchlights reaching towards the sky like luminous Roman columns.  I can see now how so many people were mesmerized by his show.  That's a warning for us today--pay more attention to the message and less to the medium.	2005-03-25

Ever!  I first came across the story in the \\"Classics Illustrated\\" (#133) comic form in the 1950's.  That was pretty good, especially the cover art.  Then came the 1960 George Pal movie with Rod Taylor.  Taylor was good, but the story was weakened by changes.  Changes such as the time traveler moving through the 1st World War, then the 2nd World War, and finally, the great atomic war of the 1960's--remember that one?  When will Hollywood stop \\"improving\\" a really good story?  Then came the 2002 movie with Guy Pearce.  The only thing that movie had in common with the Wells story was the title, and Guy Pearce was no Rod Taylor--maybe a Don Knotts.  Want to see Wells'  future?  Then go back to his original story.  It's not long, the hardcover edition in our library is only about 75 pages.  It's not a polished work, he was in a hurry for publication, but that's OK--real life is unpolished.

However, Tompkins cannot answer the three key questions of how, why, and when. How were they were built? For that see Joseph Davidovits' \\"The Pyramids: an enigma solved.\\"  His answer is simple, ingenious, and convincing.  As for why, read Zecharia Sitchin's \\"The Wars of Gods and Men\\" for a speculative but intriguing thesis.  When were they built?  I havn't found a good book on that subject, other than the speculations of conventional Egyptologists, although the readings of Edgar Cayce seem intriguing.  Tompkin's book really is great, but I think he would agree that all the mysteries of the pyramids are nowhere near being solved.	2005-03-07

Why?  The title of course--Behind The Flying Saucers!!!  Think of it, a book that would tell what's \\"behind\\" those mysterious objects in the sky!  But the guy knew nothing about flying saucers or outer space, except that the earth was the fourth or fifth planet from the sun.  But what a great title!  Scully was a writer for \\"Variety,\\" the entertainment tabloid.  However, the book was written more in the \\"National Inquirer\\" tabloid style.  I know that that description has become a cliche, but this was the kind of writing you'd expect to find sandwiched in between photos of the baby with two heads and the wolf-boy from Brooklyn.  Absolutely nothing of interest in the whole book!  As bad as the book is (real bad), it was a best seller in its day (1952, I believe) because of its catchy title, and as such, is a collector's item from the flying-saucer-crazy 1950's.  Five stars as memorabilia.	2005-02-24

Could the light that many people claim to encounter during a near-death-experience be something other than a being of love and forgiveness--as they seem to assume--perhaps actually something malicious and deceptive? Thats the warning in Rawlings' book.  The author bases his belief on the numerous accounts he has collected of NDE returnees who related hellish experiences.  Could it be that not everything is as rosey on the \\"other side\\" as we have been led to believe by other NDE books?   <br /> <br />Yes, the book could use some editing.  Yes, the author does get off on tangents such as CPR, his religious beliefs, and judgements of other religions.  Yes, there is a shortage of these negative NDE's in the book.  Finally, I found his experience with an out-of-body-experience while piloting a private plane suspiciously similar to that written by Charles Lindgbergh in \\"The Spirit of St. Louis.\\"  But these criticisms are very minor compared to his new perspective on NDEs, and the very possible value of his warning.	2005-02-16

Rand's genius was in formulating ideas and putting them down in a powerfully lucid form, not in setting a personal example.  I can't say having read Barbara's and Nathaniel's books has affected my view of Rand's Objectivist philosophy--and why should it?  A good idea is a good idea, no matter what the faults of it's author.      As for the authors, both Barbara's and Nathaniel's books are first rate.  While I can't vouch for the accuracy of the details, they seem to ring true.  While Barbara's was a true biography, Nathaniel's was his tell-all of his long-running affair with Rand. This difference in perspective allows the books to compliment one another.  Even after many years I still can't decide which one was better.	2005-01-23

This book is a must for anyone interested in lucid dreams because it presents such a complete overview of the subject.  However, there are several shortcomings.  First:  The style is somewhat dry and academic, which is fine if you're only interested in the facts, otherwise it might seem a bit boring.  Second:  Laberge give numerous tips for inducing lucid dreams, but success seems to depend more on a positive attitude than technique--they do help, but the results are often minimal.  Third:  This last criticism concerns the out-of-body experience, or OBE.  Laberge seems to consider the OBE as just another dream.  But for those of us who have experienced one, there is a subtle but real difference.  Perhaps the subject was too esoteric for Laberge, but for those interested in both, Oliver Fox's \\"Astral Projection: A Record of Out-Of-The-Body Experiences\\" contains a personal account of Fox's attempt at distinguishing the two.  Read Leberge first, then Fox for an eyeopener.	2005-01-16

How this came to be controversial was a mystery to me until I read this book.  He explains that women with high levels of testosterone are more like men. These women tend to be more aggressive and exhibit other masculine traits.  Of course these are most often the women who do the studies, write the books, and set the femminist agenda that say there are no differences between the sexes--perhaps never quite realizing that most other women are just naturally feminine.  For the other side read \\"Same Difference: How Gender Myths Are Hurting Our Relationships, Our Children, and Our Jobs\\" by Rosalind Barnett and Caryl Rivers.  I could be fooling myself, but the other side seems to be based more on what the authors want the world to be, rather than what it is.

That solves a lot of problems:  No need for a massive ramp larger than the pyramid to haul the blocks up.  Rubble was passed upwards in baskets from man to man.  No need to explain how the Egyptians carved millions of perfectly shaped blocks with only copper tools.  No need to explain why some blocks in the second pyramid weigh two hundred tons.  When you're hauling blocks, smaller is better, but when you're pouring, one large block is quicker. <br /> <br />The author give numerous other bits of confirmation:  The perfect fit of the blocks because they were poured against each other.  The distorted pattern of fossils in the blocks caused by dumping in thousands of fragments.  Air bubbles near the tops of blocks caused by air in the still fluid cement migrating upwards. <br /> <br />Why hasn't this theory become widely accepted?  In a way it's too good--who in the field of Egyptology wants to admit not seeing this simple solution for himself?	2004-12-13

Hancock also speculates that the memory of this civilization was lost due to a world-wide cataclysm.      However a major part of his evidence is the famous Piris Reis map that shows parts of North and South America along with a part the Antarctic drawn from pre-Columbian sources. Hancock says that this points to that prehistoric world-wide culture that explored and mapped the world long before the European age of discovery.  With the publication of Gavin Menzies' \\"1421: The Year China Discovered America,\\" a whole new light is thrown on the Piris Reis map.  We no longer have to go back to pre-history to account for early maps; the Chinese drew them and they found their way to Europe.  Columbus and Magellan both claimed to have had maps that showed them the way.  Now we know where they got them.

Because the earth is rushing up to meet the balls, both seem to fall to the ground at the same rate.

Weinstein treats the case like an onion, he peels off one layer, then another, then another....  His treatment of when the Hiss typewriter was manufactured would fill a small book in itself. The same is also true of the transfer of Hiss's car to the communist party, the Soviet gift of a carpet to Hiss, the dating of Chambers' microfilm, and so on.    So why didn't Weinstein go on to become another Bob Woodward?  Probably because his conclusion that Hiss was, in fact, a communist spy was unacceptable to so many people at that time.  This was a great injustice to a man who told the truth and was himself suprised that the facts so heavily vindicated Chambers.    With the publication of Sam Tanenhaus's \\"Whittaker Chambers: a biography,\\" the truth of Weinstein's conclusion has now been, finally, accepted by most people-even on the left.  But why Tanenhaus's book, which  contains hardly anything new, should have changed anybody's view seems odd.  I suspect that with the passage of time, Tanenhaus's softer tone, and Hiss's death, many Hiss supporters felt the time had come to concede an unpleasant truth.	2004-12-01

Dembski's book is poor reading because it mixes the two.  This is the same mistake the Darwinists make when they confuse their ID opponents with creationists.  While the ID position shares much common ground with creationism, that position is strongest when it relies on it's scientific strengths, as with Michael Behe's \\"Darwin's Black Box: The Bio-Chemical Challenge To Evolution\\".  If the argument for Intelligent Design is ever proven, then the question of whom the designer is can be addressed, until then the emotion-laden issue of God's existence should be put aside.  Science and religion may one day come together but that day is not here yet.	2004-11-29

However, after only a few pages, my eyes began to glaze over.  With all the possible material to choose from, the author chose to focus on the \\"Baltimore Affair.\\" I had never heard of this \\"affair\\" before, but now know that I didn't miss much.  The entire book is written more in the dry style of a academic paper than one for the general reader. While it may appeal to some insiders in the research community, to capture any wider audience the author needed to inject some spirit, graphic images, personalities, atmosphere, humor, drama, or anything into his account to spark some reader interest.  Fraud in science is a great idea for a book, but the author having grabbed the ball...dropped it.	2004-10-22

The title quote above is one example of her style that took my breath away while reading the first fifteen chapters.  However, when I continued reading the next day, all that magic had disappeared. I'm not sure whether the author had lost her spark or if my feminine side had just become saturated, but what had seemed, at first, such a sparkling book had become merely tedious.

For a Darwinist response to Behe read Niall Shank's \\"God, the Devil, and Darwin: A Critique of Intelligent Design Theory\\" and see just how weak the \\"science\\" on the other side is.    P.S.  Another reviewer (January 16, 2005) criticized me as being \\"oblivious to the science involved\\" in this problem.

I just finished \\"Unfit For Command\\" so I thought I'd read the other side of the story.  The first suprise came with Brinkley's account of Christmas Eve.  Not only was there no trip to Cambodia, but the entire day was fully accounted for by a \\"special breakfast\\", the beginning of the Christmas cease-fire, a mortar attack and fire-fight, a Christmas greeting to his commander, and then, back at base, letters home.  This seems a little too much for Kerry to have \\"forgotten\\" and then to have \\"remembered\\" as a trip to Cambodia.  Another suprise was that any mention of Kerry's trip (trips?) to meet with the North Vietnamese in Paris while a peace activist was omitted. But overall I found the book fairly well written and more interesting then I had expected, except for the strong political bias to be found in any campaign book.  One major shortcoming:  After finishing the book I found that not even a hint of Kerry's character had shown through.  Throughout the book he was just a dark silhouette.  I wonder, is something missing from the book or from the man?	2004-09-30

I was also reading Perrett's book at the time, so I flipped ahead to page 387 to compare his Battle of the Crater with the movie's.  I Found:  \\"Thousands of black soldiers found themselves pushed into a pit 30 feet deep.\\"... \\"Hundreds were slaughtered and hundreds more captured.\\"  Actually General Grant had been stricken with a bad case of \\"political correctness\\" just before the attack and had replaced the black division, specially trained for the assault, with white troops unfamiliar with the objective.  Grant hadn't wanted to be accused of uselessly sacrificing black troops.  He wasn't.  The Civil War has been over now for almost 150 years, but apparently Perret still hasn't gotten the details on this battle. Apparently the editorial reviewers also failed to notice the sloppiness in Perret's \\"research\\"- that was left up to the Amazon costumers.  The book is also superficial with nothing new except the errors.  I would like to say something good about the book but nothing comes to mind, so back to \\"Cold Mountain.\\"  Except for the battle scenes at the beginning, it might have been written by Perret-it's bland and boring.  Whenever it got too boring a bunch of really nasty guys would ride in and rape, murder and/or torture, just for the pleasure of the viewing audience.  If you liked the book you might even like the movie.	2004-08-14

I am also sure that conventional theories of evolution and histories of man have missed much and that Cayce gave clues that may help fill in those blanks.  However, Church based this book not only on the readings of Edgar Cayce but cherry-pickings from Blavatsky, Nostradamus, the Bible, and many other esoteric sources - which he then cements together with his own speculations.  So this book is not really Edgar Cayce's story.  The style also leaves much to be desired.  Church repeatly brings up subjects only to tell the reader that he'll get to that later.  The author also constantly refers to his text as a &quot;journey&quot; that he and the reader are going on.  That style might be appropriate when delivering a slide-show to grade-school students, but seems condescending to me.  Consider this book an introduction to the subject until a better one comes along.	2004-07-19

I also believe that the book is basically a truthful account of Monroe's experiences because several of those  experiences he relates closely parallel my own.  For example: I clearly remember as a child being sent to bed for a nap and then finding myself under the bed floating a few inches above the floor while resting on my fingertips.  This is not the kind of detail that someone else could dream up independently; but Monroe tells of having that identical experience.<BR>However the book does have two major flaws.  First: Monroe never seems to have heard of lucid dreams.  While other authors, such as Oliver Fox, spend considerable effort to distinguish  LD's from true projections,  Monroe seem to consider all his nighttime adventures as OBE's.  Second: His style is stiff and has a pseudo-scientific air to it.  This second criticism is especially unfortunate because, having listened to a number of his tapes, his natural down-to-earth storytelling ability would have made this book more of a pleasure to read.  Thats why his book is a flawed classic.	2004-03-06

Robert Bruce introduces the reader to his concept of the &quot;mind split.&quot;  This mind split is what makes OBE's so seemingly difficult to achieve.  It's not that we don't have them, it's that we don't remember them, and if you don't have the memory, it's as if nothing happened.  He goes on to explain that the projected body carries with it it's own projected mind, and that it is this mind that experiences and remembers all that happened OOB.  The trick is to get this projected mind to down-load the OOB memories to the physical brain on return to the body.  This is the best new idea to help understand OOB's to come along in many years.  This section of his book alone makes the purchase price worthwhile.  <BR>Unfortunately the rest of the book is not so orginal or interesting.  The style is bland, filled with fuzzy mystical terms, redundancies, and personal experiences that seem a bit contrived.  The book is also overly long because of it's attempt to be an explain-all of the OOB phenomenon.  Someone once said that it takes two to make a great painting; the artist to paint, and someone to tell him when to stop painting.  This goes for writers too.	2004-03-01

The other is Herbert Greenhouse's \\"The Astral Journey.\\"  These two books compliment one another because while Greenhouse draws on the accounts of many people, Fox keeps his story very personal.  Of the two styles I prefer that of Fox.  While his firsthand accounts lack the scope and detail found in Greenhouse's larger volume, he somehow captures the atmosphere of the astral state.  This subtle mood of Victorian spiritualism is what makes his book such a pleasure to read.	2004-02-07

At least the best I can remember is that I was probably about 10 years old at the time. We lived in an old house on Pa Route 611 with the Delaware river just below our back yard.  The place was really run-down, but I couldn't imagine wanting to grow up anywhere else.  Looking out the hallway window at dusk I would watch cars going down 611, their taillights glowing red when they braked rounding the curve.  Back in my bedroom I could look out the window and see down through the tree branches onto the Delaware.  Across the river was the Baker Chemical plant with its tall smokestacks pumping out white clouds.  Back in my room a plaster ceiling panel had been ready to fall for years, while the rest of the pale blue ceiling was stained with gold watermarks from a fire long ago.    Late one afternoon I was laying on my bed looking at those water-marks and trying to imagine what objects they resembled, like I would do outside with clouds.  Then a funny thing happened.  Without any transition I found myself floating above the bed with the ceiling just two or three inches from my face.  For some reason I didn't feel afraid nor did it seem especially strange.  I looked to my left out the window, down through the trees onto the river and then to my right at the opposite wall.  Except for being up by the ceiling eveything seemed normal and I remember saying to myself \\"Hey! This is neat!\\"  Then I thought \\"What if one of those big black spiders comes out while I'm stuck up here?\\" and with that fear I found myself back on my bed.       Laying on my bed I tried to figure out what had happened.  It never occurred to me to ask my mother, or anybody for that matter, it was just something that I needed to figure out myself.  I had always thought I could come up with an answer for anything, maybe not the right answer, but at least some kind of answer.  This was different.  No matter how hard I tried I couldn't come up with an explanation.  Well maybe I had telescopic vision like Superman and the ceiling had only appeared close!  I didn't really think that was the answer because the angle from which I looked out the window was down from the ceiling.  But I still remember going back and laying on the bed the next day and trying to activate my \\"telescopic vision.\\"  Well it didn't work.  It hadn't been a dream, so what was it? It really bothered me.  I thought hard and often with no answer.  As the months and years passed I grew so frustrated that whenever I got thinking about that time I would shake my head and push the thought out of my mind.                   Twenty years later I was going through the local Walden's Bookstore.  I  couldn't find anything of interest in the non-fiction dept. so I strolled over to what was then called the \\"occult\\" section.  There I found Greenhouse's \\"The Astral Journey.\\"  I didn't buy it that day because I certainly didn't believe in that sort of thing.  After all, everybody knows that we evolved in some kind of prehistoric soup and the idea that we have a soul or astral body or spirit that can leave the body is... well... dumb.  I did buy the book several weeks later if only to prove to myself that I was open-minded enough to examine the other side.  I opened the book to chapter 1.       I can still remember the scene that night perfectly.  I was seated in the cafeteria of the American Can plant where we made plastic Dixie Cups.  I remember the windows to my left, the doors to the production floor on my right, and the lunch-pail rack just in front of my table.  The title of the first Chapter was \\"A Trip to the ceiling\\" where the author described his astral journey to the ceiling of his bedroom.  If anybody had been watching me as I read those words they probably would have seen a light bulb go on over my head.  In the first chapter of the first book I ever read on Out-of-body-experiences I found the answer to that experience that had troubled me for so many years.       This book covers the whole spectrum of the OBE from apparitions to Zoroastrianism.  Actually at times I found that spectrum a little too broad, being fairly skeptical about the claims of Uri Geller, Ted Serios and some others in the book.  However, better too much than too little.  A tip: always keep a yellow highlighter handy when reading this or any other OBE book, because now and then you'll come across passages that bring back memories of little anomalies that you long ago pushed from your mind.  What better way to learn the truth of anything than by discovering that you have already experienced it yourself?	2004-02-05
