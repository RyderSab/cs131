I never would have dreamed that some doctors would take their knowledge of a particular medicine and use it to kill.<br />For example, the doctor who injected his wife with a type of &quot;instant cancer&quot; then amusingly watched her die just so he could be with his mistress. Another doctor, a plastic surgeon, who performed a majorly botched liposuction on his wife, resulting in her death. A jealous doctor who tortured his wife with acid to &quot;take her beauty away&quot; over an imagined affair. And more.<br />These are all true stories. It chills me to the bone to think that if a doctor ever snapped, they would be so coldblooded.	2004-06-28

Jory is the complete opposite. When the mysterious &quot;Woman in Black&quot; moves in next door, things get really interesting.

UGH. All the talk about phalluses made me queasy.<br />And the handfasting ceremonies in this deal with the bride and groom cutting themselves and then mixing their blood?

If you're someone who is following a wiccan path but not all light and flowers, this is definetly the book for you. Proves once and for all that dark does not equal evil. That is not what the left hand path is at all. You still keep the standard beliefs and ethics, you just work with dark god/desses and in the dark of moon. After all, the dark deities need to be acknowledged too. If there was no crone, there would be no rebirth.	2004-06-25

It is advanced knowledge and mostly for teachers and coven leaders. I am neither a teacher nor a leader but this was still an important book for me. Grey Cat sometimes resorts to using minor cuss words to get her point across and she does a great job of getting her point across in that way. She writes in a way that is easy to understand and, at times, is very humorous. <br />The first half of this book is deeper knowledge, which I was hungering for, and the second half is for organizing and leading rituals. I am not at that point yet but it is still good material to know because who knows when you may become a high priestess? It may be alot sooner than you think.<br />Grey Cat keeps alot of general how to out of this book and I really appriciated that. I am at the stage where I am no longer a beginner but not really advanced yet and alot of the stuff that she writes was easy for me to understand. Overall,I would recommend this book to anyone who is tired of reading the same beginner material over and over and wants a little bit deeper knowledge.	2003-07-05

Sometimes we cannot work with the physical animal itself so we have to work with them on the astral plain, ie meditation.

The roller coaster capitol of the world started as a small amusement park with just a water slide and this book plots it's history through the beginning, the depression, the 50's and 60's all the way up to the 90's. It's so interesting to find out the history of some of the most popular amusement parks and this one is one of the best I've ever read.	2003-07-05

It contains scrying, tea leaves, and using regular playing cards to tell the future. Doesn't go into a lot of detail on everything but is a good place to start if you are a beginner. I love the way the book is fashioned, kind of like a personal diary.	2003-07-05

Beware though, some of the spells seem kind of unethical to me, but then again you can always alter them. Contains folklore, charms, and a few potions. Some of the spells are only a couple of lines long but the whole page is devoted to that one spell. Seems kinda like a waste of paper to me. Overall a good book for spells but if your looking for a religious experience, look somewhere else.	2003-07-05

The artwork is good, the companion book is very in depth, and the readings are great. <br />In the beginning of the book, it tells you how to use the cards to discover your very own totem animals. After you discover what animals are your totems, you flip to the page the animal is on and find out all about the animal as well as what the animal has to teach you. The book is also very good to use if you see an animal in the wild or if you have visions. Pay close attention. These animals have alot to teach you.<br />This is one of my favorite divination decks as well as teaching animal medicine. The deck also includes some blank cards so you can include animals that may not appear in the deck. Don't get me wrong, the companion book is not the only book that can teach you about certain types of medicine, but if you don't have any other books, it is a good start. The animals never stop teaching us.	2003-07-05

The artwork is amazing and the companion book is very accurate. A little bit different from traditional tarot but still very accurate. Each card has a different goddess on it and each goddess may have a different message for you. Good as a daily one card oracle or a regular tarot deck, this deck is one of my favorites!	2003-07-05

It's about a girl who finds a niche with a wolf pack. After studying them for a while at a distance, she becomes one of them. The story is heartwarming and,to me, shows that humans and animals can help and understand each other.	2003-07-03

The artwork is beautiful and the booklet is very well written. The fact that the meanings are written on each card helps the reader from having to look up meanings to much.

Complete charts in the back of this book make it simple and easy to plot your own astrological chart. The chapters then tell about each aspect of the chart. I have been interested in astrology for a long time but all the other books I read made it to complicated to plot my own chart. This book is definitly a great reference book and a big helper if you plan to plot charts for other people.	2003-07-02

She expains the three aspects of the triple Goddess in detail, complete with myths and lore. The untrue myth that the dark goddess is all about gloom and doom is completely shattered in the section on the Crone. The Goddess is to be respected in all her aspects and is essential to birth, death and rebirth. This book also contains meditations to meet with and understand all three of the Sacred Mother's faces. A definite keep in my library!	2003-07-01

What is a \\"slut\\"? The word really has nothing to do with sex. The author's own story as well as other women's stories in this book had nothing to do with sex. This label that people put on women is really just an insult out of jealousy because of developing early, an outcast, or someone who is confidant in their sexuality. Really it is put on another person out of jealousy. This book is definitly recommended to anyone who has ever been called a slut or just to get more of an idea about the double standards between males and females.	2003-06-29

This is generally an encyclepedia of every magickal thing you can think of. Great for teenagers. However, it is not the only book you should have. You need to have basic knowledge of the craft beforehand. A great reference book to have on your bookshelf.	2003-05-27

Tells about the author's real life journey on the path to wicca. Because it is based on real life experiences, anyone who reads this book will know that the craft is not an easy path to follow and working magick will not get you out of hardships by just twitching your nose. A beautiful book about the path to true wicca.	2003-05-27

Not only magick, but the history of the craft. The only complaint I have about this wonderful book is it focuses on Gardnarion a little bit too much. Aside from that, you can adjust various rituals and rules in it to suite your tradition. It also includes questions at the end of each chapter to test what you have learned. An excellent book whether you are a beginner or 3rd degree.	2003-05-27

I am not a satanist but reading this book taught me that satanism is not what most people think it is. Everyone who thinks satanism is evil should read this book. It really puts everything into perspective. Anyone who has a warped image of what satanism is should read this book. It is really just a \\"looking out for number one\\" type of \\"religion\\". The only person you can rely on is yourself. The picture of Anton Levey isn't bad either. I think the bald head is [nice].	2003-05-27
