Jenkins, who wrote SF under the pseudonym Murray Leinster. The stories range from as early as 1934 (The famous &quot;Sidewise in Time&quot;, about alternate history lines parallel to ours) till 1956 (&quot;Critical Difference&quot;) and amongst them are classics as &quot;First Contact&quot;, ground for an idealogical flap with Soviet writer Yefremov back in 1959, and &quot;A Logic Named Joe&quot;.<BR>The book shows Murray Leinster at his best, being the writer of entertaining short fiction. Compared to some other writers of his period his work hardly seem dated and considering that his earliest story was sold in 1919 (!) that's quite a compliment.	2003-06-08

How come? <BR>One: it's [inexpensive], but the content isn't. <BR>Two: it has good photographs, especially when compared against it's contemporaries. <BR>Three: as a bonus it contains the complete original 96 page flight handbook! (Being brought back to 4 pages flight handbook in one page of the Len Morgan book). <BR>There are better books about the T-bolt/Jug/Juggernaut, but if you want a collection of different books about this plane you sure have to buy this one. If you're lucky you can even get a hardcover.<BR>Apart from the manual (AAF Manual no. 50-5), this book has something else to set it apart from all other Thunderbolt books: it has an overview of every surviving P-47 up to 1963, plus photographic material of most of them, including some vintage Confederate Air Force shots from the time they only had 9 fighter planes and still painted their aircraft white.	2003-03-29

Must have at least 20 books about the P-51 by now, but as photobook alone this one still stands out. The 160 pages have not the usual black-and-white pics, but some in color as well. But this books has other strenghts as well. The text is very informative and covers not only the WW2 history of this all-time American great, but also tells the Korean story. Some of the text chapters are written by co-authors who tell their own use and history from actual (combat)experience, even a ferry pilot tells her story.	2003-03-11

It is indeed a welcome addition to &quot;Attack of the Airacobra, Soviet aces, American P-39s &amp; the War Against Germany&quot;, because the latter book may not suffer from extreme thinness, but has an meager photographic section. 'P-39 Airacobra Aces' bridges that gap, because most Airacobra aces were Russian, hence a lot of Russian planes in the sideview section, and quite a lot of photographic material about Russian aces as well. A welcome addition for both modeller and historian and a good book about an underrated plane and its faithfull pilots. If I'm not mistaken this book is also translated into the Russian and part of the 'War in the Air' series of Tornado Publishers (no. 45 of that series), a fitting tribute to the quality of this book.	2003-02-07

This books tells a relatively unknown story, the story about how American Lend-Lease aircraft were transfered to Russia. From the 14.500-odd planes that went to the Russians during WW2, almost 8.000 went by the ALSIB route (Alaska-Siberia). 2.618 of these were Airacobras, 2.397 of them Kingcobras. This book describes how it was done and by whom, both in English and in Russian. The focus is not on the planes, but on the people from those two great countries who helped each other against their common enemies: the cold and the Germans. Apart from the text, there are also many photo's describing the harsh conditions which both Americans and Russians had to face, most of the depicting the people, but there are some good shots of Airacobra's and Kingcobra's as well, though not as much as I hoped there would be. There is also room enough for other types, you'll find B-25's, A-20's, C-47's, P-40's as well. Good background material for the serious WW2 aircraft historian, giving a look behind the scenes and insight that not many other books about WW2 aviation can hope to match.	2003-01-30

Though modellers might probably prefer the Osprey &quot;P-39 Airacobra Aces of World War 2&quot;; the Squadron/Signal aircraft in action  no.43 &quot;P-39 Airacobra in Action&quot; or even the Aircraft in Profile no. 165 &quot;The Bell P-39 Airacobra&quot; for the color sideviews and paint schemes or will value the Squadron/Signal &quot;P-39 Airacobra in detail and scale&quot; for it's description of the various kits which are available, plus the detail photographs.<BR>This book however is more in the line of Rick Mitchell's &quot;Airacobra Advantage: The Flying Cannon&quot;, one of the best overal books about the Airacobra. Compared to this book it is better illustrated and has a more pleasant layout, comparable to two books about the Airacobra who are sadly not easily available: the Polish AJ-Press &quot;Monografie Lotnicze Nos. 58 and 59. <br />Amongst all these books this book still manages to offer me new facts, photographs, overviews and drawings, a remarkable fact considering that it is by far the cheapest book around for this plane.	2003-01-18

This book provided me with some background and development history, but above all it shows what a remarkable variety of painting schemes were used by the Japanse Army Air Force in their different theatres of operation. Though the quality of the -many- photographs leaves something to be desired at times, they are the real thing, and Mr. Bueschel must have gone through many lengths in acquiring them from their Japanese sources. <BR>The original Osprey book was published in the early 1970's and the value and demand was apparently such that Schiffer books has republised it, and they claim theirs is the revised and updated version of this book, one of the all-time Osprey classics about Japanese aviation.	2002-10-17

If aircraft (and aircraft books) could be compared to PC's, the Kawasaki Ki-61 Tony could be considered a clone (using the same engine as the German Bf 109), and the final variant, the Ki-100 (taking a very different radial engine), a major upgrade. <BR>This book is meant to be an upgrade to the earlier book with the same title and author, published in the early 1970's by Osprey. In this case it is a long overdue re-issue of a book that for many years was the virtualy the sole source of supply in both visual history of the plane and of its painting schemes, both of which this book has ample supply. Maybe Schiffer can be talked into re-publishing the whole Aircam line?	2002-09-29

The fact that the plane acquited itself very well there remained relatively unknown to most people, and Mr. Mitchell was one of the first to put things right in his book. <BR>It is a good book about the Airacobra, with history of the plane and it's Nephew/successor, the Bell P-63 Kingcobra, a nice comparison section to put things in perspective about the various fighter planes, personal accounts, a part about surviving planes and a thorough bibliography. <BR>The only thing missing for me was a color art section, showing about the plane's camouflage and markings, but there are special books for that. The fact that the copy I bought was the second printing of March 1995 -the first being of March 1992- prooves that there is a steady market for books of this quality.	2002-09-20

The JAAF however had it's own 'Zero': the Nakajima Ki.43 Hayabusa (allied code name 'Oscar').<BR>This plane is the subject of three remarkebly similair books: this Osprey/Aircam no.13, the ARCO/Aircam no.15, and the Schiffer Books 'Nakajima Ki.43 Hayabusa I-III', the second volume in their series about Japanese aircraft. How come? The British book is the original, the ARCO/Aircam is the Americam edition of it and the Schiffer Books' version is the revised and updated edition of the original. Together with the 'Aircraft in Profile no.46' (to be found in 'Aircraft in Profile vol.2') and a Hayabusa book by Merriam Press they form pretty much everything that has been published about this plane in the English language. It is done in the usual Aircam-style: 50 pages crammed with black-and-white photographs, 8 pages of colour art and a text portion of 8 pages in his case.<BR>A must for the modeller, lots of painting schemes can be done with this book at hand. If and when you're fluent in Polish you can buy two Polish publications about the Nakajima Ki-43 hayabusa as well (AJ-Press \\"Monografie Lotnicze\\" and Ace Publications \\"Pod-Lupa\\"). If your knowledge of languages extends to Japanese there is a wealth of other sources, amongst them three different editions of the Bunrin-do's Famous Aicraft of the World series.	2002-09-06

Top of the market in my eyes is 'Warplanes of the Third Reich' by William Green (672 pages!), but this book can serve as a nice companion or indeed as a replacement if your budget is a bit tight. The main advantage this book has compared to William Green masterpiece is the colour artwork, which is sadly lacking in the Green book. The only thing in which the comparison falls out negative against Green is the amount of information about each individual plane, but there is more general information about the Luftwaffe in WW2 to make this up. Highly recommended indeed.	2002-09-02

Nevertheless it remains one of the best quick references for silhouetes and open airframe drawings, which have been used by Mr. Green over and over again in his later standard references such as the ten volume \\"Warplanes of the second World War\\" or the twelve volume \\"WW2 Aircraft Fact Files\\", both published by Macdonald and/or Jane's	2002-09-01

Whatever you might think of what is being done to those last surviving WW2 warbirds at Reno, fact is that some of the most spectacular paint-shemes are flown there, the cover of this book only giving a glimpse of the beauty of what is inside. For the ones of us who like to see just how the world-record holders level flight for piston engines looked like there can be no better book in my opinion, and this book shows them all: Mustangs, Bearcats, Corsairs, Thunderbolts, a Lightning, Furies, a Warhawk, an Airacobra, Kingcobras, Spitfires and even a Yak-3.	2002-09-01

The quality of the colour photographs of the surviving 'Forts' is good to very good and this book gives you 128 pages full of them, showing all surviving (?) 'Forts' in almost every known colour they ever flew.<BR>The only thing missing is some WW2 material, and some background text, for the book is focussing soley on photographs of surviving Fortresses. This is hardly surprising as you know that Michael O'Leary took all photographs himself and saw his first Fortress in the early 1960ies. Other Michael O'Leary titles I know of -and own- in this series (all of the same high quality) are about the P-51 Mustang, the Grumman cats and a book about both the P-47 Thunderbolt and the P-38 Lightning. I look forward to buy even more books from him.	2002-08-31

The only dissapointment for me in this book was the mistake to name the Bearcat by its right name, naming it F8F Wildcat, but that is the only thing I found that I didn't like. The book gives an excellent full colour overview of all Grumman survivors that served in WW2, up to and including the 'Duck' in the paragraph 'Turkeys and Waterfowl'<BR>As with other Michael O'Leary books in this series the focus is on photographs of surviving planes, all taken by Michael O'Leary himself, so don't expect to see original WW2 colour photographs or some Korean ones for that sake.	2002-08-31

Most of these books share the distinction that they are out-of-prints (OOPs), but both the Squadron/Signal issues will soon follow. Amongst the books which in my eyes offer more are <br />&quot;Bf109, Classic aircraft no. 2, their history and how to model them&quot; (offers a wealth of information about the early Bf109's); <BR>&quot;Messerschmitt 0-nine gallery&quot;(offers a wealth of information about the later Bf109's); <BR>the three books in the Monogram close-up series (Gustav 1 and 2 and Bf109K) and <BR>&quot;The Ausburg Eagle, a documentary history&quot;, <br />but generally these books are bigger and therefore able to pack more information.

There are in my eyes three good books written which combine both religion and serious science fiction, and apart from \\"A Case of Conscience\\" by James Blish and \\"Deus Irae\\" by Philip K.

Now, almost forty years later, there is a little more known on this subject, but back then this must have been the standard reference for quite a while, with some additional information to be found in books such as \\"Aircraft in Profile no. 234, Heinkel He 177 Greif\\" and in more general titles such as \\"Men & Machines, volume 9: German Air Force Bombers, vol.2\\"; \\"Famous Bombers of World War Two\\"; Warplanes of the Third Reich\\"; \\"German Aircraft of the Second World War\\" and so on. Not only does this volume deal with all variants of the He 177, its succesors, the He 274 and He 277, get mentioned and phographed as well.<BR>The book gives some good detail photographs as well as some good shots from a He 177 tested by the British after the war. All in all, I would buy this book just for the historic interest alone, it being the first good monograph about this plane.

It includes 10 stories, ranging from &quot;Road to Nightfall&quot; (1954) to the 1971 Nebula Award winning &quot;Good News from the Vatican&quot; (1971). The book has a foreword by Barry Malzberg, who gives a good review of the work, and the importance of Robert Silverberg up to that point. Robert Silverberg himself does an introduction to his stories, which were taken from at least seven different collections. Two of the stories -&quot;Hawksbill Station&quot; and &quot;Nightwings&quot;- were later expanded to succesfull novels, Nightings also won a Hugo Award as a short story. There is yet another award-winner included: &quot;Passengers&quot;, winner of the 1969 Nebula Award. But it is up to yo, the reader, to decide whether the award-winning stories are indeed better than the seven who did not. To the reader who has read more from Silverberg it is to say whether these stories are indeed 'The Best' that Robert Silverberg produced over that period, because he had some nineteen (!) collections done up to that point and I for myself at least found several who I dearly missed in this one. A definitive &quot;The Best of Robert Silverberg&quot; over that period compiled by me however would have some 30-40 odd stories, just too much for the average 'The Best of'.	2002-07-13

Loads of photographs, splendid (color)artwork, and also very informative. This one has even 8 extra pages compared to the earlier title.<br />I don't understand this policy of Squadron/Signal, they should name this one &quot;Lightning in action, Volume 2&quot;, I had to ask the shopowner where I bought my copy whether there was any difference between the two books with the same title and he assured me that when the numbers differ, the contents differ also.

You get to know how the testing was done and just what the hazzards of flying the Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot; were.

Though the book is published in Britain, the writers all hail from the USA -as does Curtiss Aircraft- and these gentlemen give you the history of each and every 'Commando' ever built and a lot of black-and-white photographs of this plane. The 146 pages of this book are printed in a rather small typewriter font, so there is more information than you should judge just by mere size of this book.	2002-07-03

When it appeared in Germany as \\"Bv 138, der Fliegende Holzschh\\", the German publisher Podzun Verlag had tried to get all remaining photographic material. They didn't use all available drawings though, you can find some additional ones in books as \\"Warplanes of the Third Reich\\" or \\"Warplanes of the Second World War, Volume five, Flying Boats\\", both by William Green or in \\"German Aircraft of the Second World War\\", by J.R. Smith and Antony Kay.<BR>But you won't get much more information from those books on this plane, and hardly any extra good photograph.<BR>On the whole I would say that with a bit more unit history and a good colour art section this book might earn its fifth star.	2002-07-03

So now we have a German book, probabely published some years earlier than 1992. If you own one one the more recent books about the Me262 there is a chance that you develop a strong deja-vu feeling looking through this one. On the other hand, if you already own several of the classics about the Me262, you get the same feeling reading one of those 300+ pages blockbuster about this plane as well.<BR>My advise: there are worse things you can buy about second world war aviation than the Schiffer Military History series, and having a complete set of schiffer books is quite a collection to have. Compared to the brand-new reference bibles about the Me262 it is quite affordable too.	2002-07-02

If however you want a good bookabout the Me262, spend your money on another book. To buy that six-volume blockbuster: bring lots of money, but you'll have everything about the Me262 you can think of, apart from the original plane itself.	2002-07-02

I always wondered if Mr. Bueschel would write more about Japanese planes, or whether Osprey or Arco would publish more from him in their -now abandonned- series. <BR>It might be possible to write a better book about the Hayate, and maybe there is a book in Japanese that is better than this one, but if that is the case, how come that we don't know about it?<BR>So congratulations to Mr. Bueschel and Schiffer books for the fact that they found each other and that Mr. Bueschel is able to continuate -and even expand- his series about Japanese planes in the second world war, for some time the only reference about these planes together with the book Japanese Aircraft of the Pacific War by Ren Francillon and the book about the camouflage and markings of Japanese Army Air Force planes by Donald W.

It's the Aircam, the Profile and this one Aero Publisher's Famous Aircraft No.2, and it is the oldest of the three. The recent Schiffer publication is a slightly revised and updated version of the Aircam and is probably the best book available in English, but if you come across this one, be sure to take a look at it. You'll find some unique, large, high quality photographs of the \\"Frank\\" of the Air Museum you won't find anywhere else, and in close detail as well. This book's text is its major weakness: a mere two pages, and in a rather large font as well. Still, it was state of the art in 1965. I wonder what Japanese aviation buffs think of this book....Bunrin-do publishers must have published at least three different editions about this plane in their \\"famous Aircraft of the World\\" series.<br />A nice touch is the review of the then excisting model planes of the Frank on page 32, focussing on the old 1:72 Revell kit -which I build myself thirty years ago- and the 1:50 UPC/Marusan.	2002-07-01

The revised 1984 edition had a different ISBN number, and I hope more pages and a better text. Nowadays there are two publications about the Corsair with the same number of pages -both with the same title, same writer and from Squadron/Signal- who manage to give the impression that they offer you twice the material published in this book. The sole reason for keeping this copy for me is that there are photographs only to be found in this book. If the 2nd edition is revised and enlarged, and has all original photographs then that should be the version for you to go after. If you suffer from 1960ies nostalgia, buy this one.	2002-06-30

Together with ist supplement this 1970 book has something to offer, it becomes 90 pages of information together with good photographs and a good text. Without the supplement it loses much informational value about the units who flew this plane, where and when, something the Squadron/Signal book can't offer in its 49 densely photo-packed pages. Compared to earlier books in the Aero series this one stands out by having far more and better textual information by the writing duo B.R.Jackson and T.E.Doll, who also wrote the book about the Devastator in this series.	2002-06-30

This was mainly because of the time it went to combat, too long after it had been put into service. When it entered service, it was one of the most modern planes in the world as this book explains. Good text, lots of good photographs and splendid artwork plus the fact that there is not much to choose between for with this plane are the main reason for the four stars, its is by any way far superior too the sole other book specially about this plane, Aero Series No.23 from Aeropublishers, from 1973 till 1989 the only monograph devoted to this plane.	2002-06-30

The first in this joined PSL/Airfix series not to serve as elaborate background material for one of the later company's 1:24 kits, it still has a nice modelling section, describing e.g. how to convert your Lancaster into a Lancastrian or a York. The cover of this book is a colour photograph, not as with the previous five books the same painting as on the Airfix modelbox, an easy distinction. Later books in this series (Mosquito, B-17) were even more like common aviation books in outward appearance, though they all shared the same format. It is a shame that such a good serie has come to an end. <BR>Funny thing is that a likewise and very recent series by SAM publications starts with the same aircraft as this series.

Even the maimed leftover struck me as very good, so I bought it a year or two later in London. It is a book by itself, not just another book about the Hurricane with lots of photographs. The atmosphere created can only rivaled by 'Hurricane Aces', as both books are more about the men than about the technical backgrounds, while other Hurricane books are more about the military history of the Hurricane and its units.

The series was centered upon Airfix' new series of 1:24 model planes, which were very good. These books were even better, they took far less space and were very good value for money. Seven of the chapters deal with the Spitfire history and the final three deasl with the model itself, plus eventual conversions you might want to make. All this you get with lots of photographs, both of the actual plane and, in the last three chapters, from the model. The writer of this part doesn't act as the marketingteam of Airfix, but gives his honest opinion as to the do's and don'ts. In britain this book has at least seen some two reprints -I own the 2nd reprint of september 1976- and later paperback reprints seem to have been made of this series, though I have only seen the first four of them that way (Spitfire, Bf109, Mustang, Hurricane).	2002-06-28

With so much sideviews in just 38 pages you can imagine the depth of the text, but you can also say that the story of the battle of Britain is told in another book, and that this special is only for the modeller who wants his/her Hurricane, Spitfire or Messerschmitt to look different from the standard Airfix or Matchbox kit. <BR>The artwork in the book is good for its time (1970), but since then a lot of water has passed the bridge.

And that all has to fit in just 49 pages...there we have the main weakness of the 'in action' series; there is simply no room for much text in the formula they have chosen for this series and any writer with more material than can be put in the space available will just have to write yet another book. Credit to Squadron/Signal: they let that book be published as well.

Though the texts are rather short, and there are no colour paintings or photographs in the book - as with all other books in the Putnam series -, really all Japanese planes get mentioned.

To really top it off you could also buy the eight Osprey/Aircams about Japanese planes, or all 16 'aircraft in profiles', which would give you more additional information about colour schenmes and markings, and also some aditional photographs, but the backbone of your Japanese library would still be the book by Ren J.

US	38546666	R14OBYIGZ8FT3S	184176289X	534700511	Gloster Gladiator Aces (Osprey Aircraft of the Aces No 44)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Gloster Gladiator Aces	Compared to it's successors, the Hurricane and the Spitfire, the Gloster Gladiator hasn't been much published. This book shows that this plane deserves far more than it got attention-wise. Quite a few of the great names flew Gladiators, the RAF's last fighting biplane and one of the best ever produced. This is a distinction that only the Italian Fiat Cr42 could hope to match as you learn in this book, one of the few about this plane since the classic \\"The Gloster Gladiator\\" from Francis K. Mason in 1964, which set the standard about publishing this plane for the last 38 years. This year not only saw the book by Andrew Thomas, but a book by Alex Crawford as well...	2002-06-25
US	38546666	R5SN03AOWBMJ8	0816865795	430520895	Japanese Army Air Force Camouflage and Markings World War II	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Japanese Army Air Force Camouflage and Markings World War II	When this book appeared in 1968, it set the standard for other books to follow. At that time there was not much published about Japanese planes in English, and this book gave an excellent overview of most of the planes used by the JAAF, plus their camouflage and markings, which untill then was an unknown area outside of Japan itself. For todays's standards the 'aircraft in profile' section might leave something to be desired, at the time of publishing there was only one way to get more material; buy each and every of the &quot;Aircraft in Profile&quot;series about Japanese planes and each every Osprey/Aircam about Japanese planes as well, a rather costly excercise and also quite time-consuming. Together with the companion volume &quot;Japanese Naval Air Force Camouflage and Markings World War II&quot; from the same author and also published by Aero Publishers, it is still one one the standard references about this subject.	2002-06-25

The only thing that in today's eyes could have been better is the artwork of the 'aircraft in profile' section. It lists all of the planes that were used operationally by the JNAF and most of the planes that were tested, and that is including types as the 'Kikka', the Japanese Naval jetfighter. Today's enthousiasts must be prepared to pay a hefty price for this book though, ...	2002-06-25
US	38546666	R2S4LEQ0S4542E	0668022981	845639471	Mitsubishi A6M1/2/-2N Zero-Sen in Imperial Japanese Naval Air Service (Arco-Aircam aviation series, v. 1, no. 18)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	ARCO/Aircam 18, Mitsubishi A6M1/2/2n Zero-Sen	When this book was published in 1970, it became the standard reference for everyone who wanted to know what a Mitsubishi Zero looked like. Still one of the most densely packed photograph-books about the Zero, it is now no longer available from its publisher, and one has to find it on the second hand market. As with all books in the Osprey/Aircam series -in the US published as Airco/Aircam- it is well worth searching for. One would hope that the publisher would consider a re-issue every 20 years or so, but until now that has not been the case. That is even more to be regretted as one consideres that the volume about the Zero was a volume 1, implying that they had more material and that a volume 2 was also considered.	2002-06-24
US	38546666	RH7IO6FWA3OR	0897471415	195151125	A6M Zero in Action - Aircraft No. 59	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A6M Zero in action, Squadron/Signal No. 59	Though officially out of print, this book can still be bought by the persistent enthousiast. Its strenght -as in all books in this series- lies in the abundance and quality of photographic material, considering the number of pages, fifty. The photographs compare very well to the other main source of Zero/Reisen photographs, the Osprey/Aircam No.16 written by Richard Bueschel in 1970, definitely out of print, and far harder to get. This Squadron/Signal book is together with &quot;Zero&quot; by Robert Mikesh and &quot;Zero Fighter&quot; by the same author THE standard A6M reference for me.	2002-06-24

Of all publications about the Me 262 that I own it is the only one that still can be bought, a tribute to its quality. Though riddled with small (printing?)mistakes in the German words used in the text -only to be spotted by people speaking that language I hope-, it remains a good and affordable book, specially when compared to the latest blockbusters about the Me 262.	2002-06-24
US	38546666	R2X4P90GQ23FG1	087938915X	806655799	Zero: Combat and Development History of Japan's Legendary Mitsubishi A6M Zero Fighter (Motorbooks International Warbird History)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Zero, History of Japan's Legendary A6M Zero Fighter	When you are not fluent in Japanese, there are not very much other publications about the A6M Zero I could recommend you to buy. This book has it all: splendid photographs - both historical and of surviving planes-, an indepth text which not just tells the allied side of the story - there is a forword by Zero Ace Saburo Sakai himself -, and a good bibliography of 27 earlier publications about this plane, proving that the author can read the original language himself because most of them are in Japanese. It also list all the classics in the English language up to publication date, only missing the ARCO/Aircam No. 18 by Richard M. Bueschel, published in 1970 and since long out of print, though updated and reissued by Schiffer Books in 1995. The Polish/British Mushroom Publications brought out a Zero monograph by Artur Juszczak as well in November 2001, more focussed on modellers, which can also be used as a sort of 'Walk Around', because there are shots of almost all parts and angles of the plane, something which it has in common with another Polish 'Zero' book by Arthur Lochte.	2002-06-24
US	38546666	R3BP7ZATVVCRS5	1857800834	875884976	Soviet Combat Aircraft of the Second World War, Vol. 1: Single-Engined Fighters	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Soviet Combat Aircraft of the 2nd World War	On of the pleasant surprises of the fall of the iron curtain is that the interest for second world war aviation appeared not to be restricted to the western world. Since then there is a steady flow of books about Russian aviation and aviation on the Russian front, viewed from the Russian side. <BR>Up until the fall of the iron curtain the main source of photographic material about Russian aircraft seemed to come from captured Russian planes flown by Finland, or from a very small collection of the same photographs which were used over and over again by everyone writing about the subject. Not so in this book. There are a few well known photographs, but there is also plenty of new material, new drawings and even new planes compared to older -western- books about the same subject. I was extremely lucky to buy this one second-hand for as little as 27 Euro -who wanted to depart from this book?- but I'm afraid that I'll have to pay the full price for volume two about multi-engined fighter planes, attack aircraft and bombers. Will there be more? A volume of the same quality about Russian flying boats or transport planes would be very welcome.	2002-06-24

I/IV in Royal Air Force & Foreign Service (Arco-Aircam Aviation Series, No. 33)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Hawker Hurricane Mk.I/IV, review of a modeller's standard	Though since long out of print (OOP), it remains one of the standard works for modellers who want to change their standard Hurricane kit in a different version. The paintings of Richard Ward were for long years the standard in aviation side-views, and there is quite a lot of them, fourty-eight to be exact, inside plus an additional four on the front cover. The books is also packed with black and white photographs of the plane and has a comprehensive text about the plane's history.<BR>Note: This book was published both by Osprey as no. 24 of their Aircam series and by Arco as no. 33 of their Arco/Aircam series!	2002-04-26

All colour illustrations are new, most of them of the few surviving Hurricanes, of which this book gives an excellent overview. The black and white ones are all of the best quality and together they give you a thorough look both around and in the airplane itself. I'm dumbfolded about it being out of print.	2002-04-23
