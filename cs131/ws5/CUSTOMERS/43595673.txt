My department's hiring practices were in need of overhauling, and this book served as great guide.  Readers will find a description of the hiring process that really mirrors software development itself.<br /><br />The book begins with an overview of the hiring process, and then it looks at the various stages in detail.  A hiring process should begin with an analysis of the job for the position you are trying to fill.  Then you design a job description, ads, and interview questions.  Next you implement the interivew questions with phone screens and on site interviews.  Finally you extend offers and bring candidates in for their first day.  All along the way, you evaluate what you are doing and let new information feedback into the previous steps.  It really follows the pattern of iterative software development.  As a bonus, the author provides templates for forms that you can use along the way during the process.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is faced with implementing a hiring policy that they don't understand or who feels unprepared for the process.  I found it to be quite helpful.	2005-05-30

It looks at the job from a number of angles.  Readers a given a foundation of what leadership is followed by examination of the roles and duties of the front-line manager.  The author uses character and principles as the foundation for his philosophy on management.<br /><br />In this book, one can find practical advice for things ranging from managing staff and project manangement to customer interaction.  Having spent two years as a front-line manager before being promoted, I can say that what Dr. Peeling has written rings true based on my experience.  I also really liked that he gives not only the what, but the why as well.  It is an excellent experience based guide that people can return to as the need arises.	2005-05-30

I came across this book when I was looking for something to add to the basic knowledge that I had.  Don't worry though, the first two chapters go over the basics.  If you are not familiar with MBTI, this will get you started.  If you are familiar with it, it serves as a good review.<br /><br />Then the heart of the book takes you through three tools for identifying peoples preferences:  type preference as a whole, temperament, and extraverted/introverted feeling.  After putting all of these together, the authors present you with some case studies where you use the various techniques to try to identify the types of the people involved.  They are simple but useful.<br /><br />The book closes with some detailed advice for interacting with the four different temperaments in general and then specifically the four individual type preferences within a given temperaments.<br /><br />The final chapter is titled \\"How Will I Ever Look at People the Same Way Again?\\"  Truthfully, you won't.  You will notice things about people, and hopefully these things will help you improve your interactions with the people you come in contact with.	2005-03-08

Karten does a good job of laying the foundation of communication in the first 4 chapters where she talks about the roles of senders and receivers in communication.  Nothing in these chapters is really groundbreaking, but it sets the field for what is to come.  Chapters 5-8 relate communication to the building of relationships.  There are important ideas about how to build strong foundations, appreciate differences in people, trying to see the other person's point of view, and maintaining relationships.  In these first two sections, one of the repeated themes is paying attention to the other person.  Other people are different than we are, and we need to allow them to be themselves.<br /><br />The last two sections of the book deal with customer service and managing change.  The customer service section seemed pretty straightforward to me.  If you are having problems with your customer interactions, chapters 9-11 have some good ideas for improvement.  Chapters 12-13 deal with managing change.  Most people have a hard time with change.  In chapter 12, Karten presents a few models for explaining change; however, she focuses on the Satir model.  The main takeaway for me was that people will struggle with change, and you cannot expect otherwise.  Chapter 13 presents some good tips for how to communicate effectively when leading change.<br /><br />The advice in the book is practical, but it will require discipline to make the changes necessary to improve your communication skills.	2005-03-08

It is ideal for current software developers who think they might be interested in leadership.  It begins with some basic ideas about leadership and how they will relate to the rest of the book.  The real meat of the book is in sections 2, 3, and 4 which are dedicated to Innovation, Motivation, and Organization - the three key components of being a technical leader.  Weinberg does an excellent job of explaining these topics as well as the barriers to them.  Each chapter ends with a list of questions.  You will not get as much out of the book if you do not take the time to think through and write down your answers.  Also, you will be asked to begin keeping a personal journal in one of the chapters on Innovation.  You will not regret taking the five minutes a day to do this.  It is well worth it.  The book ends with some advice to help you implement changes necessary to become a technical leader as well as understand why you want to do it.  The book asks a lot of its readers, but it gives a good return on the investment.	2005-01-17

However, when positioned as the third installment of the Space Trilogy, it is a square peg being placed in a round hole.  There are a number of things about this book that break the harmony with Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra.<br /><br />1.  Dr. Ransom is not the central figure of the story.  There are vague references to him earlier in the book, but it is at almost the halfway point that we see Ransom interact with the rest of the characters.  Some may find this similar to the way The Two Towers is written, but the big difference between the two is that all but one of the characters in The Hideous Strength are brand new.  Even Devine is going by a different name.  At least in The Two Towers, you were reading about familiar characters for the first half.<br /><br />2.  The number of characters in this story is significantly large in comparison to the other two books in the trilogy.  You meet as many characters in Bracton alone as you see in the entire length of Perelandra.  That doesn't even take into consideration the characters at Logres and the N.I.C.E.  This seems to take away from the cohesiveness of the Trilogy and almost detaches it from the other two stories.<br /><br />3.  The role of the Oyarsa is quite different.  Given that the story is set on Earth, this is somewhat expected.  However, never having them speak just doesn't seem fair after their involvement in the other two stories.  Lewis should have let the Oyarsa from Mercury and Saturn impart wisdom as Mars and Venus did.<br /><br />Again, this *is* a good book if you take it by itself.  There are even some things related about the differences between men and women that are quite funny but true.  Look for MacPhee's comparison of how the two sexes use nouns.  Married people will get a chuckle.  However, given that this is supposed to conclude a trilogy, it really fails in that regard.  If you are expecting something that performs like Return of the King, you will be quite disappointed.omething that performs like Return of the King, you will be quite disappointed.	2004-08-14

Whereas &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; relates the story of Ransom's self-discovery, &quot;Perelandra&quot; is the story of Ransom discovering his purpose for being sent to Perelandra. Perelandra is a young planet, and Ransom finds himself in the middle of an innocent world with only two humans. It is a wonderful tale of how this version of the Garden of Eden unfolds. There is a good balance of action and adventure with reason and beauty.<br /><br /> The only knock I have against the story is in how it is organized. The beginning is in chapter 1 while the end is in chapter 2. The remainder of the book gives the detailed account of what happened in chapter 2. I found this somewhat odd, and it takes some of the tension/suspense out of the story because you already know how it ends.	2004-08-03

I came across this book and decided to give it a shot.  I knew that Lewis and Tolkien were contemporaries so I expected a work of quality.  I was not disappointed although there is definitely a difference in writing style between this book and LOTR.  First of all, Lewis has far fewer characters in his tale - I would say that there are only 6 that are given significant detail.  This is helpful because you have to focus much more on the scenery and alien beings.<br /><br />As for the story, you get to take a journey of self discovery with Dr. Elwin Ransom - the central figure of Lewis' Space Trilogy.  It is difficult to say too much about the story without giving away the plot - so I won't.  Let me simply say that the story is thought provoking from a moral and religious point of view, and there is plenty of adventure.  If this sounds like the kind of book you like, give Out of the Silent Planet a try.	2004-07-31

However, I also realized that there were a number of things mentioned that I wasn't doing.  That begs the question: Is the material that simple and obvious?  Maybe not.<br /><br />Maguire gives some simple, practicle advice for improving the development environment that a manager is responsible for.  For example, he recommends starting each day by asking, &#34;What can I do today that will help keep the project on track for the next few months?&#34;<br /><br />I also found the section on feedback loops to be interesting.  The suggestion that you have a person stop feature work to fix a bug that they created as soon as it is found is a way to emphasize quality and make it in the best interest of developers to produce high quality code.<br /><br />The chapter on attitudes is also very good.  Much of the time, there isn't a lot knowledge wise that separtes good and bad developers.  The difference comes in attitude.  Attitudes such as, &#34;We can't do that!&#34;, &#34;The users won't care!&#34;, &#34;Bugs are going to happen!&#34; need to be rooted out.<br /><br />This book gives good insight as to what you as a manager can do and help your developers do in order to have smoother projects that are high quality and on time.	2004-06-14

The best thing to do is read the first half of the book (through chapter 9) and then skip around to what interests you.  As others have mentioned, you will have to modify the code in the examples to get them to work because of the use of globals.  This is not impossible to overcome if you write the message board for the book at [...]  However, it is annoying.  There are other errors too, but it doesn't take much in the way of trial and error to get around them.  The three chapters on MySQL are the most useful.  If you've worked with databases in other scripting languages, e.g. Perl, Python, or Ruby, it's simply a matter of looking up what you want to do.  There are some good style examples on structuring PHP code - use of an &quot;$action&quot; variable to drive the behavior of the site from a single page.  The book also stresses putting reusable code in include files.  The author dismisses classes/objects as not really being useful in PHP, but the use of classes elimates the need for the &quot;global&quot; declarations in many of the common include files.  All in all, this is an adequate book, but noting profound.  If you have programming experience, this book will get you up and running quickly.	2004-05-26

The references to the intercom paging system definitely date the book.  I doubt this is really an issue anymore, but I am glad that it is not.  Also, most companies are not going to allow the control over office space that is recommended in the book.  This is where the book goes a little &quot;pie in the sky&quot; to me.<br />There is still a lot of good material for managers to consider.  The authors make a very good point in the &quot;true story&quot; about the manager that brought soup in to an ill employee who was trying to meet a deadline.  Management's job is to make it possible for people to work - not just to make them work.<br />I also found the information on teamwork to be very true based on my experience.  I've seen defensive management at its worst, and how it was terrible to the team environment.  Defensive management is a result of not following one of the earlier concepts of hiring the right people.  Ultimately if you don't trust people to get the job done, why did you hire them in the first place?<br />Most of the information is not new nor is it really profound.  However, that is the kind of thing that is usually taken for granted.  The authors have given the material a good treatment and encourge the readers against this very thing.	2004-04-18

However, putting XML in the context of something familiar, i.e. Perl, made it much more accessible.  This book gives a nice overview of XML parsing using event based and tree based parsers that are available as Perl modules.  The book presents SAX and DOM standards compliant modules as well as modules with more Perlish interfaces, e.g. XML::Grove and XML::Twig.  It discusses the pros and cons of event vs. tree parsing of XML as well as a few advanced technologies such as database integration and SOAP.  The only knock I have on the book is that the examples are a bit contrived and do not show how to solve meaningful problems.	2004-02-14

If you are a software developer, buy this book for your boss.<br />Much of what DeMarco says goes against &quot;traditional&quot; management practice, but that is the point of the book.  Software development - or the broader term knowledge work - does not present a traditional management problem.  Trying to use such an approach robs organizations of their ability to change in response to the situation at hand as well as burning out their developers.<br />Many organizations treat software developers as interchangeable cogs in the machine that cranks out software.  The author explains that the people who write software are not such fungible resources.  Matrix management is also exposed as not being a great idea for software developers.<br />The author also points out how the overly busy organization is often driven by fear and control.  Much of this is a result of  the dreaded &quot;agressive schedule&quot; and the pressure that comes with trying to meet it.  DeMarco also explains why Taylor's model that helped manufacturing really doesn't apply to software development.  Scientific management used for software development is the square peg shoved in a round hole in an attempt to give management a sense of being in control.<br />Then, DeMarco goes to explain what can happen in organizations that have slack.  He focuses on the middle management layer as the place where leadership and vision of change for improvement can happen.  Sadly, though, this is exactly what many organizations have cut out in the layoffs that have happened over the past few years.  The author goes on to relate how trust and safety are necessary for change to happen, i.e. failure cannot always be treated as a bad thing.  People learn from mistakes.  It takes slack to allow for mistakes and learning to take place.<br />The closing section on risk and risk management were a good conclusion to the book.  Building on the notion of the &quot;agressive schedule&quot;, he goes on to explain how each risk is assumed to have a 0% chance of happening in these situations.  The tradeoffs and payoffs of risk mitigation are also shown.  With risk mitigation, the earliest possible completion date moves out by some amount, but the latest possible completion date moves in greatly.agressive schedule&quot;, he goes on to explain how each risk is assumed to have a 0% chance of happening in these situations.

Although presented in the context of work performed on Microsoft Visual C++ 1.0, the author does a good job of generalizing specific experience.  McCarthy gives us an honest look into the ups and downs without sugar coating or promising silver bullets.<br />Presented in a format similar to Meyers' &quot;Effective C++&quot; books, the text flows very well and is a pleasure to read.  When you read many of the pitfals presented, you may think &quot;Duh!&quot;.  However, these are things that I see happen regularly.  Here are some of the highlights.<br />Rule #2 &quot;Get Their Heads Into The Game&quot;.  This sounds like a very simple rule.  Everyone on the team needs to be contributing ideas toward creating intellectual property.  However, most people know this is easier said than done.  McCarthy goes on to explain the barriers to the flow of ideas.<br />Rule #4 &quot;Don't Flip The Bozo Bit&quot;.  This rule is necessary to keep #2 working.  The author deals with the natural tendency that people have to become defensive when criticism is offered of their ideas.  This can actually cause both the critic and the one being criticized to tune each other out.  The author suggests that team members call each other on it when the Bozo Bit is being flipped.<br />Rule #25 &quot;Don't Accept Dictation&quot;.  This topic is addressed in many other texts, but that fact should tell us that we aren't getting it.  McCarthy reminds us that it is foolish to accept dictation of scheudle, features, and resources.  The &quot;Holy Triangle&quot; has to be balanced and tradeoffs are required when changing any one of these three.  Managers are encouraged to be strong and take a stand when they find themselves in this situation.  Eight years after this book was published, I still see this very thing happening.  Until something changes, we will continue to see this issue addressed in software management texts.<br />Rule #31 &quot;Beware Of A Guy In A Room&quot;.  Software development is a collaborative effort.  Don't let people isolate themselves.  There is no opportunity for feedback or help when problems arise, and this can derail the project.<br />The appendix on &quot;Hiring And Keeping Good People&quot; is also very helpful.  If you are like most managers, you didn't get to hire most of the people that work for you.  Here you will find practical advice for letting your superstars reach their potential and getting something out of everyone.ule #31 &quot;Beware Of A Guy In A Room&quot;.

I'll highlight the ups and downs below.<br />Good Stuff:<br />The author does a good job of explaining Taylorism, why it works for manufacturing, and why it doesn't work for software.  Taylorism assumes that a problem is predictable, controllable, and therefore needs mere optimization.  Software does not fit this mold.<br />Another thing that the author presents well is the lack of silver bullets.  He presents his material as a \\"lead bullet\\" and warns against hype.  This is not new or novel, but something that we need to be reminded of.  He also admits that agile methods have their faults, but suggests that they are a better approach than the traditional manufacturing based software methods.<br />Bad Stuff:<br />There's really no other way to put it than the author goes way out in the weeds for his main premise to support growing software.  He bases his arguments on complex adaptive systems as applied by Stuart Kauffman to biological evolution.  This is a theory that cannot be proven, and an odd metaphor to apply to software development.  However, I will let the author himself give the most incriminating testimony:<br />\\"Regardless of whether or not Kauffman's hypothesis is true for biology, the idea holds interesting possibilities for human interaction in trying to solve messy problems.\\"<br />Miller spends the entire chapter outlining Kauffman's theory only to say in the end that it might not be true.<br />There are much better works on taking an alternative approach to software development that lack the flaws of this book.  Give Pete McBreen's \\"Software Craftsmanship\\", Tom DeMarco's \\"Slack\\" or Poppendieck and Poppendieck's \\"Lean Software Development\\" a try instead.	2003-09-02

The author is correct in identifying &quot;code and fix&quot; as a bad way of developing software, but the material here is swing too far in the other direction.  McConnell suggests that certification and licensing for software engineers is the way to improve software along with adherence to ISO and/or CMM.  Certification only implies that someone can pass a test, but it does not show that they can create quality, useful software.  Also, the rate of change of technology for software development is too high to support licensing.  The ACM pulled out of the SWEBOK effort for this reason.<br />&quot;Code and fix&quot; is a problem, but McConnell does not present a reasonable solution.  Look at Pete McBreen's &quot;Software Craftsmanship&quot; for a better alternative and more information as to why certification and licensing is not the way to go.<br />I will say that the chapter on Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator for software developers is very intersting, and it gives some insight into the kind of people that excel at developing software.  Even books that are way off base can provide a good nugget here and there.	2003-09-02

One of the great things about this book is the approach that it takes.  Rather than giving a prescription of &#34;do this, and you should get these results&#34;, they give a framework for thinking through the issues and making good decisions.  Each chapter concludes with a section called &#34;Try This&#34;.  My organization has already benefited from the suggestions for identifying waste.  Again, they don't tell you what waste to eliminate, but rather how to go about looking for wasteful items.<br /><br />Another thing that the authors have cleared up is the improper distinction between principles and practices.  The authors claim that many of the problems in software today come from the fact that manufacturing *practices* have been applied to software development rather than manufacturing *principles*.<br /><br />The principles that are explained throughout the book are based on successful companies outside of the software business, e.g. 3M and Toyota, and how in turn these can be applied to software.<br /><br />One of the best points that they authors make - and they make many good ones - is that local optimization within an organization can actually slow down the overall process.<br /><br />The overall tone of the book is very pragmatic, and it is definitely going to be a shock to the system for anyone who is accustomed to CMMI or ISO certifications.  However, the potential results from this shift in thinking are worth it.	2003-07-25

Chapters 6, 7, and 8 are the only things of value to someone already familiar with the UML.  The previous chapters try to give the database designer an overview of using UML for all project aspects; however, this is done much more cleanly in other books like UML Distilled or Visual Modeling With Rational Rose 20XX and UML.<br />The authors also present things with assumptions made about how the organization is structured: separate application and database design teams.  This slant requires that the reader translate what is written to their particular situation. A more useful book would have stated principles that can be applied to various organization structures with appropriate practices.<br />Also, there is no advice given as to how to actually implement any of these UML extensions for database design in the available tools.  This makes the ideas presented hard to put in practice and makes the book much more theoretical than practical.<br />Bottom line, there is not enough unique information here for the book to stand on its own.  It would be better to roll this information into texts like the ones I mentioned at the beginning, and also give examples using currently available tools.	2003-06-25

As long as new people are making the shift to OO devleopment, this book will be of great benefit.<br />First of all, the authors give a very objective view of OO devleopment without a bunch of hype.  Then, the book begins by addressing the non-OO way of developing client/server applications and explains how objects can fit in.<br />After giving a road map of the possible ways to introduce objects into existing systems, the authors go in great detail of client, server, and &quot;glue&quot; OO development.  The glue is essentailly the communication mechanism used between the client and server.<br />To round out the book, the authors give good introductions to object persistence, performance, scaleability, and security.  These are all important topics with books dedicated to each of them.  Readers will be ready to read the more advanced material after having read what the authors present.<br />The last two chapters are more speculation than fact, and it would be nice to have a second edition of this book to account for the changes since the book was published in 1998.<br />As a final note, managers with a techincal background but no OO experience will find the material very useful in coming up to speed on OO client/server development.	2003-05-06

For software organizations that deliver applications internal to their company, the process in this book is probably a bit more than is needed.<br />That being said, the &quot;process framework&quot; hinges on iterative development.  The author does a good job of showing why the traditional waterfall process does not work in today's environment, and this is applies to all organizations.<br />Then the author goes on to outline how software development breaks down into phases and iterations within phases.  He also talks about the activites and artifacts that belong in each phase.  Additionally, he talks about how organizations should be structured to support the process and how to taylor the process to a specific organization.<br />The case studies support the claims made throughout the book making it well rounded and logically sound.  This process will work very well in the correct situation.	2003-05-06

Kyte has written a masterpiece in advanced Oracle knowledge.  He does three things very well in this book: tells you what is important in Oracle, why it is important, and what happens if you do things the wrong way.<br />Kyte starts out giving the foundations for Oracle databases, the architecture, locking schemes, and table and index considerations.  He gives a good treatment of the types of tables and indexes that Oracle offers including the appropriate times to use them and the trade-offs to weigh.<br />Another key topic that he covers is redo and rollback.  These features are handled in a unique way in Oracle, and a lack of understanding can lead to inefficient and incorrect databases and applications.<br />Armed with the foundations, Kyte then takes the reader through performance tuning and optimizing databases.  The best advice in this section is that performance cannot be thrown in at the end.  The design decisions for a database will determine how it performs and scales.  As he says, &quot;There is no fast=true setting in the init parameters.&quot;<br />Then the book tackles some more advanced features, such as autonomous transactions, dynamic sql, and C and Java extensions for stored procedures.  Kyte again gives good advice for when these are appropriate over standard PL/SQL stored procedures.<br />The size of the book can be intimidating at first glance, but it is pleasant to read.  Kyte uses a conversational style rather than a lecturing delivery.  This book has a lot to offer, and you won't find yourself tired after reading it.	2003-04-22

But what does it mean?  McBreen gives a well structured argument that Software Engineering and Software Craftsmanship are two different things.  The former is for large scale, mission critical projects, where as the latter is for business applications.  Having worked on both kinds of systems, I can say that the author is dead on.  The typical government/defense project uses large (over 100 engineers) development teams with cutting edge software and hardware.  These situations call for the engineering approach because the software is not the dominating cost.  However, business applications are usually built by small teams using stable technology (or they should be as the auther points out).<br /><br />The craft approach emphasizes delivery high quality, easily modified applications by teams lead by master craftsmen.  The craftsman puts his reputation on the line each time his team delivers an application, for he is responsible for the journeyman and apprentices that work under him.  This accountability to the customer builds trust between the two.  Too many applications are built and handed off to someone else to maintain.  Not so in the craftsmanship model.  The team that developes the application stays with it through its lifetime or until they have sufficiently trained the next maintainer.  The auther draws a strong parallel to Open Source development to support this concept.<br /><br />While the concepts the author presents ring true, it is going to be difficult to switch on a dime from software engineering to software craftsmanship.  Luckily, the final chapters of the book give some gradual steps that can be taken toward the craft approach: hiring people that you know to have a good reputation, design for testing and maintenance, and continual learning.  These would also benefit software engineering, but they are necessary for the craft approach.	2003-04-14

This is a great collection of wisdom for the new manager, especially Chapter 7 - First Things First: A Project Manager's Primer.  As this chapter says from the start, most people are promoted without much if any training.  This is a good starting point.  The close of the book - Chapter 45 - was also one of the highlights.  This is Constantine's advice to new leaders and those who wish to become leaders.  He makes a nice distinction between pure management, to which he claims to have nothing new to add, and leading software development.<br />The book is broken down into 6 areas (It's About People, Project Management, Under Pressue, Quality Required, Processes and Practices, and Leadership and Teamwork) each containing about 8 chapters.  You may think that is a lot of ground to cover in a book, and it is.  The chapters in Quality Required didn't seem to be as relavent to their area as the others did.  Quality means a lot of different things to a lot of different people so this is difficult no doubt.  I found the firt two and last two areas of the book to be the most helpful.<br />This may seem contradictory to the above paragraph, but I felt the book was too long.  Compared to other books such as &quot;The Manager Pool&quot; and &quot;Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering&quot;, this book is hard to finish in short bursts.  Five pages was about tops for a chapter in the other books while it was typically the minimum for this book.  That doesn't make Beyond Chaos a bad book.  As I've said it has great information.  Just don't expect to breeze through the information.	2003-04-07

I will comment about its usefulness.  In short, this book is truly valuable to the developer who has recently been promoted to team leader.  While developers would benefit greatly from this book, the reality is that most developers would rather read books like &quot;Effective C++&quot;, &quot;Design Patterns&quot;, &quot;Expert One on One Oracle&quot;, etc.  To the new manager, though, this book is a gem.  The book talks about specific management issues as well as the development life cycle and quality.  In short, the book focuses exactly on what the team leader does and the team leader's team.  In addition to the material presented in the book, the author gives a great number of sources and reference for further reading.	2003-04-04

The concepts are interesting and reasonable, but I don't think the state of things is as bad as the author suggests.  Section II wraps up by stating that business rules *should* be able to be expressed in constraints, but the SQL vendors have let us down in this area.  I find that most of the constraints that the author describes are supported by Oracle 8i which is not a new release of the product.  Much is made of automating business rules using Rule Engines, but it seems that these can be handled in the DBMS.  The advice on data modeling in the last chapter is good, and I think you can come away with a different way of looking at things.  After reading the book, though, I am not overwhelmed with the urgent need to have my team invest in a Business Rules Engine.	2003-03-17

This was one of my choices, and I was not disappointed with it.  I was drawn to this book because of its ties to the Software Patters Series because I was interested in patters as a developer.  It is questionable whether or not this book belongs in a patterns series, and the authors even admit that some of their patters are theorized rather than observed.  This does not make it a poor text, but it probably does not belong in this series.  Be that as it may, the book is broken down into five categories of patterns:  Psychological and Retentive, Behavioral and Expulsive, Strategic, Tactical, and Environmental patterns.<br />While I do not agree with everything that the authors have to say, everything in the book is good food for thought.  Many of the patterns are common sense, such as \\"21. Get A Guru\\".  Nothing makes a manager's life easier than having an expert.  \\"23. Overtime Detox\\" should be common sense, but it speaks of the state of software development when most software management books have to speak out against manditory overtime. One pattern that I really question is \\"24. Defense de Pisser\\".  This pattern suggests that drug tests in the work place should be completely done away with.  Even if I didn't agree with this in principle, it is not practal.  Many companies are in the defense or transportation industry where employees are required by the government to pass drug tests.<br />I could go on for quite a while on what the authors have written, but I'll stop at giving you a peek at the book.  While I don't agree with everything that the authors wrote, it was still worthwhile to read it from cover to cover.  For each issue they present, I suggest first deciding whether or not you agree with them.  Then answer the deeper question of why or why not.  You will be better off for your efforts if you do.	2003-03-15

One of the things covered is the &quot;Myth of Reinheitsgebot&quot;.  Beaumont explains when this is important and when it is not.  I also found the section on food pairing helpful because it gives parallels to wine and food pairings.  With the exception of Pislners and Amber Ales, most styles of beer are explored with a couple of prime examples given.  For each beer, Beaumont talks about good food pairings or good times to enjoy the style of beer as some are not as suited for mealtime.  The wonderful pictures make the book truly enjoyable.

The authors give a good treatment of the various ways to execute queries with performance tradeoffs.<br />Chapter 7 is only useful if you are working on a Windows platform.  My database is on Solaris so this wasn't something that I needed.<br />As I said, though, what's there is good, but I there is definitely something missing.  I needed to be able to call Oracle stored procedures as well as executing simple SQL queries.  It would be nice to include some examples of calling stored procedures using the major vendors: Oracle, Informix, Sybase, etc.  This information is hard to come by on the web.  There are subtleties in using inout parameters in stored procedure calls that require some extra work in perl.  You have to size variables large enough to store the largest value that is in the database.  Since perl handles all string sizes dynamically, I used sprintf to force the strings to be large enough before calling the stored procedure.  I don't know if you would run into these issues with outher databases, but it would be good to have this information with the rest of this text.  That would make this fine book complete.	2002-05-08

The book gives information on two main topics:  why boys are the way they are and the dangers that boys face in the world around them.  The views presented by Dr. Dobson are based on the Bible, and you will find that our culture does not accept much of what he says.  However, you must ask yourself if you want to raise your children based on the whims of society that are constantly changing or on the unchanging priciples of Holy Scripture.  With this in mind, here are some highlights from the book:<br />Chapter 2 & 3 -<br />Dobson presents the differences between boys and girls.  The two lists \\"Girls Are More Better Than Boys\\" and \\"Why Boys Are More Better Than Girls\\" point out these differences in a very lighthearted way as taken from letters Dobson received at Focus on The Family.  Then, Dobson goes into how testosterone plays a big factor in accounting in the difference between boys and girls.  The higher levels of testosterone make boys more likely to take risks.  Dobson discusses the implications of this fact to close out this section.<br />Ch. 4-6:<br />Here, Dobson discusses the roles that mothers and fathers play in the lives of their boys.  One of the things Dobson points out is that at 18-36 months of age, boys tend to gravitate away from their mothers toward their fathers.  That is not to say that either parent is loved less, but their is a natural transition from the intense motherly nuturing needed in the early months to the model of who the boy seeks to imitate.  Boys learn what it means to be a man from their fathers.  Of great importance in this section is how the absence of a father or father figure affects the development of boys during their lifetime.<br />Ch 9, 12, 14:<br />These chapters deal with the dangers that our boys face: homosexuality, anti-male attitudes, and sexual preditors.  Homosexuality is cut and dry.  It is forbidden by God, and Dobson tells about pre-homosexual signs that you can look for in your boys.  I found chapter 12 rather enlightening.  Pay attention to the commercials and tv shows that you see.  How many of them portray males as moral, intelligent family men?  It will make you think twice about what you want your boys to see.<br />I hope that this information helps you decide whether or not you are intersted in this book.  I happen to agree with what Dobson says based on the Bible.  If you want to base how you raise your boys on principles from Holy Scripture, I highly recommend this book.  If you are in opposition to these views, challenge yourself.  Why don't you agree with them?  In either case, your strengthen your parenting skills.and Dobson tells about pre-homosexual signs that you can look for in your boys.  I found chapter 12 rather enlightening.

The concepts that the authors attempt to relate are things that most people could use in their software development:  static and behavioral object modeling, abstraction, components, packages, architecture, and frameworks.  The problem is the Catalysis Approach.  Unfortunately, many of the terms and diagrams used are similar in name but different in meaning from what is typically written in UML.  I have numerous other books published by Addison Wesley on object modeling - Design Patterns and Refactoring to name a couple - and they tend to lean more toward the Rational or Unified Process.  It is very difficult to take the information that the authors present in Catalysis and see how it relates to the work of the GOF without a lot of translating.  This is not to say that there is not room for other processes or methodologies in the software community; however, the average engineer sitting at his desk is going to have a hard time mining the information in this book because of the presentation.  Catalysis may be a very effictive process, but it should be examined to see if it can use UML in ways that most software developers are accostumed to seeing.	2002-02-01

Like the first, this is an advanced text, and a solid working knowledge of C++ is necessary to get the most out of this book.<br />For those without experience with Sutter's previous book, this is divided into &quot;Items&quot; grouped together by broad subject area.  Unless the the items make up a series such as Items 13-16, they can be read independently and in any order.  This layout is helpful to the reader who doesn't have a lot of time to read a book from cover to cover.  One can sit down and spend 30 minutes with an item and gain valuable insight into the specific subject matter Sutter deals with.<br />I enjoy the author's writing style because he tends to be more conversational than lecturing.  He interjects humor - albeit it geek humor - from time to time.  The presentation makes learning advanced techniques, dare I say, fun rather than dry and cumbersome.<br />It is also worth noting that being advanced doesn't preclude being practical.  Sutter deals with everyday topics such as the STL, exception safety, and inheritance.  If you are ready to make the step to advanced C++ programmer, this book will guide you on your way in a practical, enjoyable manner.	2002-01-30

If you have the Meyers books down cold, this is the next stop in your C++ journey.  This book is in a similar format to the Meyers books with sections and items; however, Sutter takes a different approach.  He presents you with a C++ puzzle at the beginning of the item.  You have a chance to come up with your answer and then compare it to the author's.  Some of the items make up a logical series, but beyond that they can be read in any order.<br />As for the content, this is good stuff.  My favorite is Item 21 on Overriding Virtual Functions.  The contrast that Sutter reveals between the static binding of default parameters versus dynamic binding of virtual functions shows how you can get yourself in trouble and write code that is truly unfriendly.  Other items deal with using the STL, exception safety, compilers, namespaces, and much more.<br />I don't recommend trying to read this in one sitting unless you are on the same level as Meyers, Coplien, or Stroustrup.

Cockburn gives a good exposition on the various levels and types of use cases that people use.  There is also excellent advice on how to keep from repeating yourself in use case and to keep from cluttering your use cases with conditional logic that is hard to follow.  The notion that extensions to use cases include both exceptional and optional behavior simplify use case writing greatly.  I have used these techniques and received good responses from my coworkers.  Another improvement is splitting the traditional postcondition into minimal and success gaurantees.  This idea frees you from the struggle between terminating a use case with a failure and meeting the postcondition.  The advice is sound and the examples provide good illustrations for the concepts the author presents.  This book is a must read for anyone serious about Writing Effective Use Cases.	2001-09-20

Vlissides does a lot of tying together of the work presented by the GoF.  Chapters 2 and 3 give excellent concrete examples of how to attack a design with patterns (ch. 2) and how to deal with some of the issues that come about with various patterns (ch. 3).  While I do not work with code generation tools, I can appreciate the usefulness of the Generation Gap pattern for those situations.<br />The other three chapters (1, 4, and 5) pull back the curtain a little bit on how Vlissides (and the rest of the GoF) approach patterns.  You will gain new insights and a better appreciation of for the material.  The dialogue between the members of the GoF on Multicast/Observer/Typed Message shows that these folks really are as mortal as the rest of us and have candid debates.<br />Pattern Hatching is enjoyable to read, and it will begin to take your understanding of patterns to the next level.	2001-09-11
US	43595673	R3RPJIIXG0K6OO	007212606X	72313394	Oracle PL/SQL 101	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Excellent place to start for PL/SQL	This is one of the best books that I've bought recently.  I've been a programmer for 4 years, but I just recently started working with relational databases, specifically Oracle.  This book is clear, concise, and very accessible.  The writing style is very engaging, too.  The author manages to present the material in a way that keeps your interest without sacraficing quality.  Consequently, the book is fast to read, but of great value.<br />The chapter on using SQL*Plus is of great value.  It helped me to more effective look at what is in our databases to get a feel for the results from the programs that I was testing.<br />After reading this book I felt like the author gave a solid overview of the PL/SQL language without being overly rigorous.  If you are looking for an academic treatment with lots of theory, this is not the place.  Those books are very import to broaden your understanding, but this book bridges the gap to make the advance texts accessible.<br />This is the place for Oracle beginners to get their hands dirty.  There are plenty of examples that run throughout the book to demonstrate the concepts.  As you work with PL/SQL and SQL*Plus, you will find yourself referring back to this book often as you come up to speed.  It is definitely worth the money and the time.	2001-09-05
US	43595673	R3U7SJHF5EA038	0201715945	442680947	Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A shift in thought process	This book is valuable in that it gives you new ways to approach object oriented design using design patterns. The authors derivation of the Bridge Pattern in chapter 9 was the most enlightening chapter in the book. Part III and Part IV are the best sections of the book. Part V is a little rushed especially with the last few patterns that seem to have been thrown in without much exposition. Chapter 1 and 2 are of little value to experienced OO developers; however, this seems intentional. They mention using design patterns to teach OO design so these terms are necessary. The good news is that you don't need a lot of OO experience for this book to be accessible. The main reason I hold back 5 stars is the short comings of Part V. If the patterns in this section were given the same detail as those in Part III, this would definitely be a 5 star book.	2001-08-31
