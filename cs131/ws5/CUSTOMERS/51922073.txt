With the 6th edition of &quot;Don't Go...&quot; she has compiled and reviewed almost every single like of cosmetics and skin care out there. This book is a must have for anyone who uses makeup. Each product is tested and reviewed thoroughly.  <br />Sadly, Paula says this will be her last edition although she will continue to publish her bimonthly newsletter. Oh, the injustice.  It is a shame that she takes so much heat for doing this thankless job when all she is trying to do is help the average consumer. I, for one, have saved much money by reading her reviews and purchasing only what I need based on her comments and recommendations.<br />Thanks to her, I am now an informed consumer and am no longer ignorant of topics such as sun damage, BHA's and Botox.<br />My only (small) complaint is that some cosmetics lines did not make it into this book (ie Mary Kate &amp; Ashley, Becca) I wonder why?	2003-02-03

You think you've got it bad? Has anyone ever prevented you from using the restroom facilites when your bladder was full, just because they could? Has anyone hung you from a tree just for looking at a white woman the &quot;wrong&quot; way?<br />What white America did (and still does to a certain extent today, they just aren't as obvious about it anymore) to the black community is revolting, disgusting and stomach churning.<br />I found myself closing the book in several passages because I couldn't bear to continue reading about the absolute delight white men and woman took in berating, insulting, ignoring and torturing black people.<br />You will be distubed and sickened while reading &quot;Black Like Me&quot; in which a white man uses pills to darken his skin in order to pass as a black man while traveling through the deep South. What he experiences pure evil behavior from whites (with a few exceptions). However, time and time again, he is amazed by the kindess and courtesy shown by his &quot;fellow&quot; black man. <br />Perhaps faith in humanity can be restored by witnessing how kind your fellow man can be, but you will be appalled at how cruel others can be. <br />A must read for everyone.	2001-07-11

Her stories perplex, confuse, amaze and just plain make you happy that people can write like this.<br />Her short stories are a given on any English professor's syllabus, and with good reason. Not only are they well written and chock full of metaphors and symbolism, but they speak a multi-generational and multi-regional dialect all their own.<br />Personal fave: Why I Live at the P.O.	2001-07-11

Perhaps Grafton is tiring of the Alphabet series, Perhaps she has run out of ideas for Kinsey, Perhaps she forgot to finish this novel ( I, too, kept turning the page thinking there was more and wishing for a &quot;Respectfully Submitted&quot; ) Perhaps this is Grafton's new format of letting a confusing subplot overshadow the main plot. I don't know. It's not a horrible novel, it just isn't as grand as her others.<br />And by the way, doesn't Kinsey have any damn friends that aren't over 80? I mean for God sakes, give this woman a friend already! Someone to have drinks with, someone to pal around with. Sheesh! Doesn't she get sick of hanging out with Henry, William and Rosie?<br />Anyway, perhaps Grafton is throwing her readers for a loop and we are all missing a huge secretive thing that she has included without our knowledge. Perhaps we'll all grow to love this new style of writing. Perhaps not.	2001-06-27

How can a novel that mixes religious cults, media frenzy, public backlash, crisis hotlines, child abuse, slavery, poisoning, suicide and celibacy make sense? I don't know, but it does and in a most exciting, amazing way. Absolutely entrancing to read, Survivor is one of the best books I've read this year.

Somehow these stories are just funnier when they originate from her unique voice. They fall flat on the printed page, not giving emphasis to the write words, like Vowell would speak them.

I read.  Never have I laughed out loud so much when reading.  David Sedaris' life growing up in a big family in North Carolia is either real or fiction, I don't care. Read it and enjoy.

This book will stay with you for a long time.  While you're reading it, it doesn't quite register that you might be witnessing the decline and decimation of an average, American family.  Only when you've finished does the power of Oates' writing slam you in the face like a car against a brick wall.	2001-01-24

Using flashbacks interspersed with present day, newspaper clippings with daydreams, Atwood brings the reader into the story of the Blind Assassin so smoothly one does not realize they are so involved in the story.<br />I have to say though that I did skim the novella within  the novel. I don't like science fiction, and it didn't hold my attention.  Don't let that stop you though. This book is well worth your time.	2001-01-20

The book describes  the tough life faced by Julie and her husband Hank, as they face poverty  (true poverty), floods, death and other trials of Appalachian living.       Yes, there is repetition in the description of the meals, in her cleaning,  and in her and Hanks daily lives, but that's to reinforce what Julie's  reality is: There are no diversions, that is her life!
