Every Time	Well written (though translated from the french) introduction to the capetian kings of france.  Appears on \\"Cantors 150\\" list of books about the middle ages.  Interesting to see how the practice of diplomacy, not the use of force, was critical in establishing the territorial boundaries of the french nation.  Maybe our own leaders could benefit from reading this book?  Loses a couple of \\"stars\\" for being overly schematic in organization and deadly dull. <br /> <br />Has some nice pull out maps of france in the middle ages.	2005-09-30

Maybe if you're a grad student in history	Maybe if you're a grad student in history, this might be an \\"introduction\\".  If you're a lay reader, this might be a tad much in the detail department.  Blair commands the material, but the material itself is a tad on the dry side.  I say that as someone who's read a fair amount of books about \\"late antiquity\\" and the \\"middle ages\\".  Part of that is attributable to the obvious fact that Anglo Saxon england was a brutish, hobbseian kind of place.  Certainly its a thorough read, but it lacks fun and is a slooooow read for a book of 350 pages.	2005-09-25

To a degree, this book is essential for a well rounded understanding of the era (it is included on Cantor's Canon of 150 books about the middle ages that every student should read).  On the other hand, I'm not convinced that this book doesn't overlap, to a significant degree, with volume two of Marc Bloch's \\"Feudal Society\\".  Nor, for that matter, was I particularly impressed with the writing style.  In fact, I would call this book a snoozer, and I'm not using that term lightly.<br /><br />Keen's basic analysis revolves around three interrelated aspects/facets of chivalry: social, military and ecclesiastical.  So, if someone asks you \\"What's Chivalry?\\" you can feel pretty save by answering, \\"it was a value held by segments of the land owning classes in europe during the middle ages.  it had different aspects that had various degrees of importance over the time period in question.  These aspects include social, military and ecclesiastical.\\"<br /><br />Anything more then that and you'll actually have to read the book.  One fact that suprised me was the lengths to which the church went to to discourage tournaments.	2005-09-14

The histoiographical method- his use of various sources and willingness to give voice to many which \\"traditional\\" history ignored, is most impressive.<br /><br />Considering that this book was first published in 1957,Cohn was ahead of his time in his presentation of a social history of the \\"Pursuit of the Millennium\\".<br /><br />The cast of characters is colorful, to say the least: ranters, flaggelants,  the brotherhood of the free spirit, taborites, anabaptists.<br /><br />You could almost call this a history of the \\"pre reformation\\".

Cantor in \\"the inventing of the middle ages\\".  I doubt I would ever have come across this book without the help of Cantor's guide to the literature.<br /><br />This book is translated from the German... in the sixties, but Fictenau is writing about the 800's, so you shouldn't be put off by the age of the book.  The copy that I bought is a reprint by the \\"mediaveal academy for teaching\\".  It has a plain red orange cover and lacks charm.<br /><br />The basic idea of the book is that the Carolingian Empire managed to combine a number of conflicting trends through the strong personality of its leader... Charles the Great.  After the death of Charles, the conflicts were brought to the front, and the empire disintegrated.  So lay off on on Louis the Pious, OK?  It wasn't his fault that the Carolingian Empire fell apart!<br /><br />This is a very manageable book (170 pgs.) on an immense topic and I recommend it as an introduction to the subject.	2005-08-27

Cantor puts Huiznga in his \\"outriders\\" section at the back of the book.  While he candidly acknowledges the populairty of the \\"waning of the middle ages\\" among undergraduates, he takes issue with Huizinga's scholarship.<br /><br />I think Cantor does Huzinga a disservice, for I found \\"Autumn\\" to be eye opening both for its adept analysis and its innovative method.  Huzingia is a fore runner of later developments in social history, both in France and the United States.  He anticipates the field of \\"Cultural Studies\\" in his blend of source materials and thematic chapter arrangement.<br /><br />It's hard not to think of Foucault as one meanders through three hundred pages of tossed off analysis if how people thought about allegories five hundred years ago in northern france.  As Cantor says, Huzingia wrote this book with sources available in any \\"second tier library\\".  Pretty much any criticism one might have of Foucault's scholarship one might apply here.<br /><br />It is the speculative nature of Huzingia's scholarship that is both the greatest strength and weakness of \\"Autumn\\".<br /><br />This  book is heavy treading.  The quotations are printed in their original language, with a footnote at the bottom.  The translators have added end notes to explain the more obscure cultural references, but they are END notes, so of little use during the reading.  This is not really a \\"read on the go\\" type of book.  I found I had to focus on reading 20-30 pages a night for a couple of weeks.	2005-08-17

Herrin focuses on the transistion from \\"late antiquity\\" to the early middle ages, aka from about 550 AD to 850 AD. She is specifically concerned with answering the question of \\"what makes western europe different?\\"  Her answer is that western is europe is unique in its division of power between temporal and spiritual authority (i.e. church and state).  Does her answer sound familiar?<br /><br />Herrin delves into the gradual seperation of Rome from Constantinople both in terms of theology and military force.  On the former subject, you had better be prepared for a ton of information on the debate over iconclasm v. iconophilism.  The later topic is a bit easier to grasp: Byzantium was pressed by Islam, which led to an abandonment of military responsibility in the area surrounding Rome, which led to the Popes soliciting assistance from the Franks, which led to the Holy Roman Empire, more or less.<br /><br />It's an interesting subject, and this is a well written book, but at a nearly five hundred pages, it takes a great deal of rigor to penetrate.	2005-08-02

Specifically it discusses the thinkers themselves and the institutions that birthed them.  The main word to keep in mind here is that this an \\"overview\\" of medieval thought.<br /><br />Still, making your way through it requires considerable intellectual work.  Knowles gives you a page or two of biographical summary (easy going) followed by three or four pages of text about the particular thinkers' attempt to square neo-platonism with Christian aristotlianism.  I can't say that I got all the finer points in the text-- far from it.<br /><br />That aside, the basic evolution is clear, with the high point coming in the thirteenth century as the complete works of Aristotle were rediscovered and absorbed by various thinkers, leading up to the work of Thomas Aquinas.  Thereafter, there was a retreat from the project of synthesizing theology with philosophy.<br /><br />I recently had the occasion to re-read this book after a trip to Italy.  I found it much easier sledding the second time through, and it def. helped to have in mind the Italian Renaissance for context...  Most of the activity here precedes the Quattrocentro, and most of the action takes place in France, not Italy (though Italy does play a strong role.)  I advanced my rating from four to five stars to reflect the fact that I liked this book enough to read it again five years later.	2005-07-12

Brucker does an excellent job of using the ample primary source materials located in Florence itself: his text is chock full of merchant's account books, diplomatic letters and funeral arrangements.  His treatment compares favorably with Hibberts book on the Medici, which covers much the same ground but with little or no use of primary sources.<br /><br />At the same time, the tone of the book is conversational.  Brucker doesn't let his sources get in the way of readability.  This book is one of Norman F. Cantor's \\"Core 150\\" books on Midevial studies and Cantor himself edited it as part of the \\"Historical Cities\\" collection.  Although \\"Renaissance Florence\\" was written in the mid 60's, it still feels vibrant and up to date.  I think this quality is attributable to his reliance on primary, rather then secondary source material.<br /><br />\\"Renaissance Florence\\" is broken into six chapters: the renaissance city, the economy, the patricate, politics, the church and the faith and culture, with an epilogue \\"the last years of the republic\\".  This approach provides a cohesive portrait of the Florentian golden age without unduly emphasizing the painting and sculpture of the fiftteenth century.<br /><br />I found the sections on the economy and politics more interesting then the section on culture, which is a testament to Mr. Brucker's fine scholarship.	2005-07-12

Emperor: The Life of Frederick II	This book is generally acknowledged as an excellent, recent account of the life of Frederick II.  Frederick is famous in the German-speaking world for being an inspiration to the Nazi party.  The earlier biography by Kantorowicz(who later taught in America), was seized on by Nazi's and Nazi sympathizers in support for a strong, mystical leader who would bring Germany back to greatness.  Although Abulafia notes this troubled history in the notes, he account is mostly concerned with Frederick II's actual life and times.  In a way, he is trying to debunk the superstition and legend that was built up around Frederick II in the early part of the twentieth century.<br /><br />So who was Frederick II?  He was the heir to the kingdom of Sicily and the Holy Roman Empire.  He managed to unify his vast kingdom during his lifetime, he re-conquered Jerusalem without a fight, he wrote a subperb book on Falconry, corresponded with Arab scholars and, oh yes, fought bitterly with a succesion of Popes who just hated his guts.<br /><br />In fact, these Popes, more then Frederick himself, emerge as the focal point of this book.  More then anything it was their unreasoning hatred for Frederick's power that defined his life.  Particularly, it seemed like Frederick spent the majority of his life fighting rebels in Lombardy who were supported by the Pope.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-07-11

This actually could have been a three star review, but I have to give credit to the thuroughness of the scholarship, the excellent photographs and the superb 200+ end notes, which are a mini-book in themselves.<br /><br />Orsi's book is \\"revisionist\\" if it is proper to call a thesis that glorifies a massive American corporation \\"revisionist\\".  I suppose that it qualifies if one is taking the scholarship of major American and French universities from the sixties onward as the standard.<br /><br />Simply put, Orsi's goal is to set the record straight about the Southern Pacific.  No \\"Octopus\\" in his eyes, the Southern Pacific was an important innovator in the area of agriculture, conservation and scientific forestry.  Indeed, without the Southern Pacific, California and the west as we know it would not have been possible.<br /><br />Aside from rewriting bits of history from the railroad's perspective, Orsi's main scholarly contribution is his access to the Southern Pacific's own corporate records.  Certainly this is an approach that gives a more complicated picture of the corporations motives and morals then the simplistic \\"Octopus\\" portrait of Frank Norris.<br /><br />Orsi also has access to better statistics then scholars operating in the past had (i.e. the railroad's internal statistics), so that allows him to fairly castigate those who have painted an unrealistic portrait of, say, the size of the Southern Pacific's land grants.<br /><br />Although I am sympathetic to his attempt to rehabilitate the image of the Southern Pacific, I found some of the assertions regarding the tremendous difficulties the S & P had in carrying out its good intentions hard to take.  If one was to rely on Orsi's book as one's only source, you might believe that the Southern Pacific was a money losing venture, operated out of sheer philanthropy of the \\"Big Four\\".<br /><br />I'm serious about that comment: There is no mention about the tremendous personal fortunes of Stanford, Huntington and Co., let alone any discussion of the profit of the railroad as a whole.  On the other hand, Orsi goes out of his way to demonstrate expenditures the railroad made in support of the common good.<br /><br />Of course, I can hear the authorial response: Everyone already knows about the money that was made, I'm trying to fill in the stuff that everyone doesn't know.<br /><br />Still, one example: The S & P operated the Pacific Land Company, which operated at the behest of the Big Four by subdividing land for sale.  Orsi says that there wasn't any record of how much money that Land Company made and says it's impossible to even determine how the land and profit was accounted for within the S & P.  Is that so? I find it curious, as I found the curious the almost complete lack of (positive) financial data.<br /><br />On the whole, I thought Orsi does a great job. However, I would have liked more balance, even if he is writing this book to even the score.untington and Co., let alone any discussion of the profit of the railroad as a whole.

Augustine spanned the gap between the classic world and the emerging world of the middle ages.  He started life as a Manichee and flirted with neo-platonism before settling down to life as the bishop of Hippo in Roman Africa.  His was a very \\"Roman African\\" kind of career (a phrase which meant nothing to me before this book).  Roman African Christianity was a \\"purer\\" form that was less influenced by decadent Roman/Italian ways.  In fact, the main schism of Augustine's time, the Donatists, had split from the Catholic church over the issue of Christian collaboration with Roman pagan authorites.<br /><br />Throughout his career Augustine stood for the religion of church and parishioner (as supposed to the religion of the monastaries).  His theology emphasized original sin and supported baptism at birth.  Humans needed Christianity as a weary traveller needs an inn.<br /><br />He was a prolific writer, but always anchored his writing in current events.  For example, City of God was written after the sack of Rome by Alaric the Visigoth(love those names) sent patrician Romans(who were Pagans) scurrying to Africa for succor.<br /><br />I felt I got a better sense of the \\"life and times\\" of Augustine as supposed to his thought and ideas.  Not that I have a problem with that.  Augustine is an important transitional figure between the classical and christian worlds, and his times give the reader of what it was like to live during the fall of the western roman empire.<br /><br />I recommnend it for people interested in Augustine himself or the time period in general.	2005-06-22

Mission accomplished.  Thomas Becket, the 12th century english politican/archbishop/martyr/saint, rose from semi-obscurity to become chancellor of england under Henry II and then became Archbishop of Canterbury.  After becoming Archbishop, he promptly got into it with the King (his buddy) over whether religious clerks could be subject to the king's punishment (among other issues), fled to France and spend five years arguing with Henry II over who was right and who was wrong.<br /><br />Upon his long awaited arrival in England to resume his position as Archbishop, he was promptly murdered by some over zealous nights.  The rest, as they say, is history.  He was soon made a saint because his blood had miraculous healing properties(eww.)<br /><br />Barlow knows his primary and secondary sources.  When the sources are unclear, he says so.  When the sources are absent, he tells you. It is clear that Barlow is not overburdened with a love of Becket or King Henry.  His understanding of 12th century politics and religion (really the two were inseperable) is unimpeachable.<br /><br />In summation, I found this book just as interesting for its portrait of 12th century society (albeit the elite side of society) as for the story of Thomas Becket.  I doubt I will ever read another book about Becket after reading this one.	2005-06-14

Here are answers, or at least well-phrased hedges about the most important questions surrounding William's life and conquests: Did William introduce feudalism to England or adapt existing social structures?  Was his victory in the Battle of Hastings attributable more to the exhaustion of the English after fighting off the Norwegians or more to William's superior conquest? and so forth.<br /><br />Douglas has read the primary sources in English and French (and Latin, and Italian, etc), he has read the secondary sources, he has, in short, done his homework.  I mean, how many books have you read that have quotes from reviewers on the back that say, \\"the author has set about to self conciously create a masterpiece on the subject... and he has succeded.\\"<br /><br />The funny thing about this book is that even though it is supremely scholarly, it is also suitable for the general reader.  Provided: that reader has either taken an undergraduate course in Midevial history or has done reading on his/her own on the subject.

As other reviewers have already noted, Bloch was one of the initial members of what grew to become the \\"annales\\" school of western history, though, to be fair, he died before you could call it a \\"school\\" or \\"movement\\".<br /><br />Volume one of the two volume set looks at the growth of feudalism in western society, and by western I'm talking about Northern France, Western Germany, England and Northern Italy.  Bloch's main concern in this volume is setting the conditions which led to the developmen of feudalism from 800 AD to 1000 AD and then describing the various forms that feudalism took.<br /><br />The book is well translated, and I found it hard to argue with much of the thesis.  I too have read Norman Cantor's \\"the Making of the Middle Ages\\" where he calls Bloch a Marxist (and  maligns the entire Annales school).  I've also read more recent productions from the Annales school.  I have to say, based on this particular book, I don't really see where Bloch is a)romanticizing the peasant (another Cantor criticism) or b) a marxist.<br /><br />It seemed to me that Bloch's explanation for the growth of feudalism was, basically, that central government decayed  to the point where various muck a mucks needed to find an alternative way to \\"rally the troops\\" in the face of frequent small to mid size invasions.  Feudalism, with its emphasis on individual obligation and quid pro pro, was an attempt to remedy the lack of communication over long distances and lack of central authority.<br /><br />The peasants didn't really figure in this book at all, except near the end.  Certainly, one wouldn't accuse this book of being filled with marxist/post-modern/decontructionist gobbeldy gook.  This is a must read for those interested in the field, especially lay men.	2005-06-01

After all, he's covering a period of time from the 10th to the 15th century. His basic answer is that there were \\"reanscences\\" prior to the Renaissance, but that the Renaissance was unique in that it was akin to a cultural \\"mutation\\" whereas the earlier renascences were more like revivals.<br /><br />Panofsky is not afraid to quote latin without translation, nor is he afraid to put greek in the text without providing the alphabetical version of the word or words. Also, he quotes books from at least four different languages in his subtitles.<br /><br />I understand that one does not read Panofsky for his easy accesibility, one reads him for his mastery.  None the less, the \\"readability\\" issues in this book prevent me from giving the full five stars;; just as his obvious mastery of the subject prevent me from giving it three stars.  Truly, it was the longest 200 page book I ever read, and I doubt I shall dabble further in the Renaissance (or renascences), but at least now I have a firm idea of the parameters surrounding the long running debate.<br /><br />I had the occasion to reread this book during a recent trip to Florence, Rome, etc. and I was pleased to find even more interesting and relevant then the first time.

Southern's \\"The Middle Ages\\" focuses on the period between 900 and 1200 A.D. His geopgraphic focus is mostly northern france, with some asides to Germany, Italy, Southern France and England.  His main thesis is the idea that this period saw the emergence of a personal devotion to faith via monasticism that in turn prefigured the rise of invdividual identity in western culture.<br /><br />No small accomplishment, that thesis, and no small accomplishment this book.  Southern's style of writing is charming and concise.  You don't get the thesis till the last chapter, but the preceding chapters are entertaining, enjoyable reading.<br /><br />The author who turned me on to this book was the recently deceased Norman F. Cantor in his dishy \\"The Making of the Middle Ages\\", which I also recommend for any one who is reading on this subject outside the academy.  Cantor's main point was to show how the empire building mind set of the \\"Annales\\" school of the history of the middle ages (which concentrates its focus on the role of the peasant in the society of the middle ages), had deprived other \\"schools\\" of much needed oxygen.  Well, he didn't put it that way exactly, but that's what he said.<br /><br />Cantor, of course, studied under Southern, so the bias is there. None the less, having read several books from the Annales school and none from Southern and his progeny, I would have to say that the two compliment one another (and Southern cites Marc Bloch, the much revered founder of Annales school).<br /><br />So read this book if  you want to learn more about the history of the middle ages and the growth of invdividualism in the west.  You won't be dissapointed.	2005-05-17

This book was close to a god send for me.  I've been reading almost exclusively out of the Annales school, like a blind man, having no idea that there were other areas to explore (more accurately, what those avenues might be).<br /><br />Cantor uses the personalities and backgrounds of the major midievialists to explain their works.  Along the way he offers excellent summations and critiques of the various works.  He includes a list of 125 books that provide a \\"core collection\\" of the subject.<br /><br />If there is a thesis or over riding theme in this book is that the great tragedy was the triumph of the instutition builiding Annales school at the expensive of the more talented (and English) R.W.

Cantor goes so far to present Southern's refusal to create an institute in his image as an \\"Arthurian tragedy\\".<br /><br />I understand what he's talking about since I've been reading on the subject for over a year and have yet to come across anything other the annales school and their decendants.

The first two hundred and fifty pages are as dull as any social science you're likely to read and the last hundred and fifty pages lack anything like a conclusion or summary chapter.  None the less, you have to give credit where credit is due and acknowledge the majesty of this work.<br /><br />Bailyn, in exhausting detail, uses records maintained by the British crown between 1774-1776 to document the who, what, where and why's of British migration to the colonies in the years immedietaely proceeding the revolution.<br /><br />His main thesis can be summarized by stating that there were, in fact, two parallel migrations.  The first was of unattached, single men from the area around London to the middle states of Maryland and North Carolina.  The second migration was of families from the british midlands and Scotland.  These migrants used Pennsylvennia and New York as a jumping off point for their population of the back country.<br /><br />Baiyln backs up the thesis with tons of charts, graphs and maps. This was a much heavier read then I expected.	2005-05-04

The book is, as it states, a serious of transcribed lectures that Bailyn delivered to college undergrads.  You can tell that these are lectures, but Bailyn has provided ample footnoting at the back of the book.<br /><br />Understand that this is a short book.  It should only take about a couple of hours (maybe less) to read.  \\"Voyagers to the West\\" runs about 800 pgs, so you'd probably want to read this before that, just to make sure this is what you are interested in.<br /><br />Bailyn uses four \\"propositions\\" to frame the themes of his lectures.  The propositions boil down to the idea that the received wisdom we have about the peopling of the British colonies in America is wrong and that the process was more complex then we thought.  I would refer those unfamiliar with this approach (that of framing \\"propostions\\" for historical inquiry), to the work of the Annales school in France (Marc Bloch, Phillipe Aries, etc).<br /><br />Fans of David Hackett Fischer's \\"Albion's Seed\\" will want to check this one out.	2005-03-21

Freedom	Patterson, a Harvard Professor who made his bones writing about slavery in the New World, turns his focus to the roots of the \\"value complex\\" we Americans call \\"freedom\\".  Although this is volume one of a two volume set, the author himself refers to the second volume as a \\"footnote\\" in the history of freedom.<br /><br />Patterson discusses four different time periods and their impact on the development of freedom.  First, the Greeks, next, the Romans, third, Christianity and fourth The Middle Ages.<br /><br />Cabining his discussion of all four time periods are two guiding precepts.  FIrst, that western freedom consists of three constituent elements which combine to make Western freedom \\"chordal\\".  The elements are sovereignal, civic and personal freedom.  Patterson goes to great length to demonstrate that while modern thinkers (post enlightenement) equate  \\"freedom\\" with personal and civic freedom, the type of freedom most people were familiar with back in the day was, in fact, \\"sovereignal\\" freedom, which can be described as \\"freedom through absolute devotion to a god/king/emperor/leader\\" through which the followers remain free.<br /><br />The second main insight is that a \\"slave society\\" is a pre condition for the development of freedom.  In other words, freedom developed from the yearnings of slaves to escape bondage.  In that way, freedom, the west's greatest achievment is bound up in the unspeakable evil of slavery.  I found that particular insight illuminating.<br /><br />Worthy of a read, although it takes a while to muddle through.  Patterson is fond of both the academic \\"we\\" and citing extensively from specialist scholars.  On the whole a worthwhile investment of time.  Extensively footnoted for follow up reading	2005-03-07

Not just for scholars...<br /><br />I was referred to this book by the bibliography of History of Private Life vol. I.  This is really more of a short (120pp.) essay on the title subject then a full treatment of the topic.  As a non-specialist, I found quality to be appealing.<br /><br />MacMullen sketches out a thumbnail portrait of Roman society during the republic.  It is not a complex picture.  The wealthy comprised one ten thousandth of one percent of the entire population, but they controlled almost all of the wealth.  Below them were their often wealthy slaves and on the bottom were the \\"free romans\\".<br /><br />Life in Roman times was nasty, brutish and filled with oft-violent conflict.  In fact, the Pax Romana was anything but \\"pax\\".  MacMullen's portrait of Roman life (at least in the rural areas) sounds like something a social Darwinist writing in the 19th century would approve of.  Wealth was derived from land, and conservatism in all things economic was the rule.<br /><br />Note on the other review posted: I'm not sure how one could read the same book I read and say \\"not enough detail and support\\" for the statements made.  The notes and appendixes are almost as long as the text itself!  The notes contain references to over 380 works on ancient roman life, so I think the below reviewer was not paying attention.<br /><br />I recommend this book for non specialists.	2005-02-11

The History of Private Life, vols. I-V, is concerned with the project of demonstrating private life in the west (read: France) from its Roman origins to the present day.<br /><br />Volume IV concerns itself with the 19th century.  The 19th century, with the emergence of industrialization, democratic feeling and the bourgeois, is where modernity begins. It should come as no surprise that the 19th century is also where the modern conception of \\"private life\\" began as well.  After reading volume IV, I was left wondering whether this set of five books might have read better as a set of three books: Volume one would contain Roman life, the middle ages and the renaissance/early modern period, volume two would be this book and volume three would be the twentieth century.<br /><br />Not to say that I found vol's I-III irrelevant.  However, those volumes were more concerned with antecedents of \\"private\\" life and it is only in this volume that \\"private\\" life takes center stage.<br /><br />I noticed a shift in the style of writing in this volume.  Whereas the previous three volumes were straight forward with only occasional prose that lurched into the familiar (and oft incomprehensible) style of the \\"theorists of social control\\"(Foucalt, etc).  This volume sometimes descends into the circular logic and incomprehensible theory of that school.<br /><br />None the less, this is the one book of the five that I would most recommend.	2005-01-19

[...] This five volume history of the victorian bourgeois follows a freudian schematic: the first volume dealt with love, the second with sex, and this volume with agression.<br /><br />This book was my favorite of the three I've read so far. Gay picks apart the Victorian penchant for cloaked agression with admirable scholastic fortitude.  His discussion of Foucault's theory of prisons is a high light for this entire five volume set.<br /><br />His critique of what he calls the \\"social control\\" theorists is that they fail to take into account the ability of the powerful to delude themselves into thinking they are doing the right thing, even when they are most assuredly not.<br /><br />Why stop here?

Fischer uses quilts, flags, photos, paintings, sculpture and pretty much anything else under the sun(toilet decorated with a bald eagle, anyone?) to illustrate this thesis.<br /><br />Clearly, Fischer is concerned with the idea of America.  What is most novel about this book is the way that Fischer tries to assimilate some of the newer teachings of social history with the the method of traditional history(focus on military events/political leaders).<br /><br />Never one to shy away from histiographical concerns, Fischer illustrates these varying approaches in a short appendix.<br /><br />This book is of high quality, copiously illustrated and is published in conjunction with a touring museum exhibition that is travelling as far west as St. Louis (as a Californian, I am a little upset that it isn't coming out farther).<br /><br />The chapters of the book are short to the point of being anecdotal: two pages on Emerson, four pages on Thoreau, three pages on Martin Luther King.  However, that is in line with Fischer's central concern which is to document the imagery of the ideas of liberty and freedom in American history.<br /><br />The heavier intellectual lifting is towards the front of the book.  In the first hundred pages, Fischer produces a nifty chart that documents the differing origins of the concepts of liberty and freedom (Did you know that liberty derives from the Roman republic/empire whereas Freedom comes from Germanic/Anglo tribal roots?).  He then relates these concepts to the cultural groups that settled America (and to which Albion's seed is entirely devoted).<br /><br />While it is possible to quibble with the result, I will save that for the real historians. Suffice it to say, this book is an awesome achievment, and Fischer is once again to be commended, not only for his attempts to bravely reconsile two competing schools of history, but also for his large spirited message, that groups which turn away from the concepts of liberty and freedom ultimately lose the battle in America's \\"marketplace of ideas.\\"<br /><br />A must for cynics and believers alike.achievment, and Fischer is once again to be commended, not only for his attempts to bravely reconsile two competing schools of history, but also for his large spirited message, that groups which turn away from the concepts of liberty and freedom ultimately lose the battle in America's \\"marketplace of ideas.\\" <br /> <br />A must for cynics and believers alike. <br />	2005-01-04

My reviews of the first two books in this series have garnered a fat total of 0 votes, positive or negative, so I'll make this review brief.<br /><br />This book charts the transistion from the middle ages to the beginnings of the modern period.  In the introduction by Aries (who's scholarship is the inspiration for this project), he makes a claim that this time period deserves to be treated as a seperate \\"early modern\\" period.  It's a noble thought, but the book reads more like one would expect: a lot of the middle ages and a little of modernity, but a lack of the coherence that one sees in volumes I, II and IV.<br /><br />The authors are mostly concerned with discussing two (seemingly)contradictory trends: the attempt by families to develop \\"private space\\" and the attempt by the state to intrude on that private space.  Chapter two deals mostly with the first statement, chapter three with the second.<br /><br />You have to keep an open mind with the Annales school of scholarship.  The writers favor open ended generalizations to conclusive statements and are just as interested in providing ideas for further study as they are in answering questions.	2004-12-28

Normally, I can see how  a reader might shy away from the prospect of reading five volumes on a single subject (any subject).  However, given the time span covered and the all encompassing nature of the topic, private life, this is one five volume \\"history of\\" set that is worth the time invested.<br /><br />In volume two we move to the late middle ages.  Gone is the semi-alien world of Rome, now we are emerging into the more familiar middle ages of western europe.<br /><br />Duby;s introduction discusses the different meaning of \\"public\\" and \\"private\\" power in the Middle Ages.  I'm afraid the discussion was a tad techinical for me on the first read, but the theme seems to be the gradual emergence of the state (as supposed to the family) as the center of power.<br /><br />The second chapter discusses the world of feudal (northern) france and pre-renasissance tuscan italy.  Both segments are, to my mind, what this series is all about.  I found the section on tuscan italy to overlap nicely with my reading about the Medici family.  The differentness between our world and theirs is well apparent.  For example, the Tuscan Italians(not that they would call themselves that), kept their unmarried women locked up in their homes.  the author repeatedly compares this world to the modern muslim world to give the reader a sense of what he is talking about.<br /><br />The section on \\"Exploring Literature\\" is a yawner, up there with the chapter on \\"Roman Architecure in Africa\\" from the first book.<br /><br />This book ends with a hint of the modern period which lies ahead, but all in all it is content to dwell in the midevial times and is careful not to jump the gun on the topic of modernity. I appreciated that.<br /><br />Next up, volume three!	2004-12-09

It says so on the cover of the book.<br /><br />Husband and wife team of (amateur?) scholars, synthesize recent scholarship (from mid 60's on) on the middle ages for your reading pleasure.<br /><br />As the title hints at and the subtitle: Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages, spells out, the focus is the manner in which technology and invention transformed society in the area soon to be known as \\"the West\\".<br /><br />The broadest service this book provides is to cue the reader in to the massive scholarship on the subject that exists outside the English speaking world of academia.  The French in particular have made many developments in this field of study, but their work seems to be only occasionally translated.<br /><br />The Gies' are careful footnoters and their method is fairly rigorous.  Because they rely on the scholarship that is anywhere from 10 to 200 years old, there are bound to be statements that are inaccurate.  This does not effect the merit of the book.<br /><br />This book provides and excellent introduction to the scholarship on the history of the middle ages, specficically as it relates to technology.  However, the bibliography points the interested reader to a fuller picture of the available scholarship, and therfore Cathedral, Forge and Waterwheel, is useful in that sense as well.<br /><br />Probably not for strictly \\"general\\" readers, nor for scholars/academics, this book is best for the motivated lay reader.	2004-11-23

Founded in the late 20's, the Annales school pioneered the use of the methods and teachings from other schools of social science in the service of history.  This approach spurned a focus on wars and politics in favor of a focus on \\"everyday life\\" i.e. the life of non-presidents and generals.<br /><br />The general editors of this book (Durby and Aries) were pioneers of the approach, along with it's most famous author: Braudel.  See his work on the mediteranean, or Aries' classic \\"In the Hour of Our Death\\".<br /><br />These authors are second and third generation.  The work is, on the whole, excellent, but it's a distinct style of scholarship, which may account for some of the confusion in the other reviews.<br /><br />Each chronological segment is written by a different author.  The section on Rome is an anchor to the whole five volume series.  The secton on late antiquity is a bit brief.  I skipped the chapter on roman domestic architecture in africa.  The period on the early middle ages is rich and fascinating, but too brief.  I could have read a whole book on the Merovinigian empire in northern Gaul!  The chapter on the Byzantine empire focuses on the later empeire (900-1200(?) and the source material for the last chapter seems to consist almost of entirely of information on monastery life.<br /><br />Over all, one is struck by the dramatic, though gradual, shift from pagan rome to early christianity.  It is a unique book, and well worth reading.	2004-11-02

Same goes for at least one of the reviews below.<br /><br />This series by Peter Gay chronicles the \\"Bourgeois Century\\", roughly 1820 to the first world war. Gay's approach is anchored by a commitment to Freudian theory and a cross-cultural approach that takes in British, French, German and American culture with equal interest.<br /><br />His scholarship is careful and nuanced.  He draws equally adeptly from primary and secondary materials and this volume see saws between able synthesis and novel (re) interpretations of primary sources.<br /><br />As the subtitle states, this volume focuses on \\"the education of the senses\\", which is a euphimism for the process by which a young victorian (man) learns about sex.  That is not to say that Gay focuses exclusively on the experience of men, far from it.<br /><br />Education of the Senses begins with a general introduction that I assume applies to all five volumes.  Gay is careful to explain the background of the nineteenth century: i.e. that it was a period of ferocious change and that people were greatly affected and disturbed by that change.<br /><br />The subtitle of Education of the Senses is \\"Bourgeois Experiences, I: An Erotic Record\\", and that it precisely the territory covered by this volume.<br /><br />First off, he discusses the diary of Mabel Loomis Todd, an east coast American bourgeois.  Her story is that of the woman who marries and is unfaithful to her husband.  Gay uses her experience to demonstrate that the sex life of the Victorian was more complicated then previous scholars thought (this is the overriding theme of all of his work in this area).<br /><br />Gay marches through Bourgeois attitudes towards sex within marriage (i.e. women were not sexually anthesthic), the role of feminism in Victorian culture, the place of birth control and birth, the role of the medical establishment in promoting half truths about sex, the place of pornography and the place of private family life, among several other topics.<br /><br />Gay is judicious in his use of Freudian theory, I found it interesting, not overwhelming or dogmatic.  His writing style is fluid.  First rate cultural history.  Can't wait for volume two, though I probably will wait for a while...ent in promoting half truths about sex, the place of pornography and the place of private family life, among several other topics.<br /><br />Gay is judicious in his use of Freudian theory, I found it interesting, not overwhelming or dogmatic.

As a resident of California who has visited Washington (Seattle), Oregon (Portland, Bend) and Idaho (Boise, Sun Valley), I decided to get this book because it treats the three states as a region.  I figured it would be more efficient then reading seperate histories of the three states.  I wasn't dissapointed.<br /><br />Schwanter does a good job differentiating the three states while at the same time making the case for the area's treatment as a region.  Most of the writing is workmanlike.  Rarely did I find myself transported to a different time and place.<br /><br />The most interesting sections were the early settlement of Oregon and the section dealing with the politics of Oregon in the twentieth century.<br /><br />Good introduction to the history of the area, but it didn't compel me to do any follow up reading.  Kind of seems like a community college text book at times.	2004-10-21

Werth's treatment of the tale is reminiscent of the genre of non fiction I like to call \\"The Expanded New Yorker Article\\".  That's fine, I love the New Yorker, but the weakness endemic to the genre is the feeling that 150 pages would suffice (and you're reading a three hundred page book).  Regardless, I read the whole book and don't regret it.<br /><br />Werth's treatment of Arvin's tortured feelings about his own homosexuality are sad.  Arvin's own betrayal of his friends and lovers at the hands of the authorities is pathetic.  The fact that the \\"Homosexual Scandal of Smith College\\" (of which Arvin was the primary figure) dates to 1960 is astonishing.<br /><br />It's impossible not to have sympathy for the man, but the bottom line is that he snitched on his comrades(i.e. he named names and testified for the prosecution in a co-defendant's appeal), and that taints his legacy.<br /><br />I would imagine this would mostly appeal to young academics (and would be academics).  That probabaly explains why there are 13 reviews of this book on Amazon!	2004-10-21

Important to be realistic about who writes books in the first place.<br /><br />Second, Freud was a prolific writer, and the book doesn't shy away from in depth analysis, so really it's like two three hundred page books.  Now, if that's too much Freud for you, you're probably not that interested in the first place.<br /><br />I like to read biographies of thinkers who left behind copious amount of published work.  That way, it's easier to get a sense of what you want to read (if anything) by the author.<br /><br />Because much of Freud's work revolves around family life, his family life is more then usually interesting.  It's impossible to appreciate the originality of Freud's thought without having a firm context for HIS everyday life.<br /><br />This book provides a balanced reading of Freud's controverial life.  I found the bad to be included as much as the good.  Freud's influence on the 20th century has been so profound that even if you completely disagree with the man (over, say, his attitude towards women), it is still rewarding to learn about his thought.	2004-09-27

Schindler).  The book consists of biographical essays on each architect (the Greenes are handled together) and various photos and sketches of buildings they each designed.<br /><br />This book is more like five little books; one for each individual architect.  There is little attempt to provide any linkages between them (although some links are so obvious that the style of treatment reveals them none the less); and little attempt to provide context.  The style of writing is heavy on anecdote.  \\"Five California Architects\\" gives the reader a good sense of the kind of men these architects were, but less of a sense of the position they occupied in the development of modern architecture.<br /><br />Despite its short comings, this book is a must have for those interested in the development of modernist architecture in California, and I would recommend it to all those interested in the subject.	2004-08-27

Warner is focusing on a period of time that most contemporary American's would not equate with the process of \\"suburbanization\\", but it is this very approach that makes \\"Street Car Suburbs\\" so interesting.<br /><br />Warner shows that the street cars and suburbs were both linked to the increasing wealth in the Boston area after the civil war.  Capital was looking for places to be invested and both the wealthy and middle class found it in their interest to lay the foundation for suburban growth.  The wealthy developed street car lines.  In response, many members of the middle class engaged in small scale suburban \\"developments\\".  Perhaps it the small scale of the street car suburb that will most intrigue the modern reader.<br /><br />For the most part, the builders of street cars didn't develop the housing market.  One explanation for this seeming discepancy is that the mortgage market for residences was most primitive during this time period.  Warner shows that most of the small scale \\"developers\\" carried the mortgages of the buyers of their newly developed properties!  This is a far cry from our world of today!<br /><br />Warner's photos of various homes are excellent, and they make a fine counterpoint to the text.  This book is an interesting treatment of a little known period of American suburban development.	2004-08-27

This is a ?cultural history?, though as Jones points out in his preface, he takes great pains not to define ?culture?.  Age of Energy is organized around the thesis (or theme) that the conclusion of the Civil War unleashed a hurricane of American energy upon the physical/psychic/artistic landscape of America.  It was a hurricane that had its roots in the industrial revolution and the railroads.<br /><br />Jones is more concerned with the history of ideas then the history of events, an approach that I found rewarding.  As early as the first chapter he discusses the primary conflict between evolution and theology in post Civil War, this uneasy state of tension between two conflicting ideas (and the attempt to resolve them) characterizes many of his discussions of intellectualism during this era.<br /><br />Chapter 4, called ?Energy, Expertise and Control? is a real stand out. In this chapter, he discusses the significance of the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and provides a stand out discussion of the increasing importance of the concept of ?conspiracy?.  His chapter on the ?Genteel Tradition? introduced me to a much dismissed period of American culture.<br /><br />His conclusion is that Theodore Roosevelt was the apogee of the age of energy, and I thought that a bit trite.  The rest of the book is too good for him to come to such a pedestrian conclusion.  However, I found this book to be a comprehensive introduction to an era I had previously known little about.	2004-07-30

Like Smith in &quot;Virgin Land&quot; and Marx in &quot;The Machine in the Garden&quot;, Trachtenberg ranges across disciplines (literature, economics, sociology, etc.) to develop a nuanced thesis.  Although he approaches his thesis ellipitcally (in true American Studies fashion), it is hard to deny the power of his observations.  In its simplest terms, Trachtenberg attempts to show the way in which the corporation became the dominant force in shaping American identity.<br />Importantly, he does not treat this development as a foregone conclusion.  THrought the book, he develops the idea of a counter definition of America, one that draws on the tradition of Indian culture and American Populism, to show how much the corporation had to overcome in order to dominate America's definition of itself.<br />Along the way, he tackles not only the history of the corporation itself, but the way business took over the political system and the way corporate america co-opted the artistic elite.  It is this last observation, which Trachtenberg describes via his incredible analysis of the &quot;White City&quot; at the Chicago World's Fair, that I found most revelatory.<br />Check this book out!

Hayden, a professor of architecture and urbanism and professor of American Studies at Yale, knows what she is talking about.  It was clear to me that this book is written for a general, rather then specialized audience.<br />Hayden's writting style is easy to understand, and she provides multiple in text illustrations and photographs to illuminate the text.  The book tracks the historical development of suburbs in time (the subtitle is &quot;Green Fields and Urban Growth 1820-2000.)  She starts with &quot;Borderlands&quot;, then covers &quot;Picturesque Enclaves&quot;, &quot;Streetcar Buildouts&quot;, &quot;Mail-Order and Self-Built Suburbs&quot;, &quot;Sitcom Subrurbs&quot;, &quot;Edge Nodes&quot; and &quot;Rural Fringes&quot;.  This historical approach is book ended by an introduction with two chapters and a conclusion with two chapters.<br />Hayden includes excellent end notes and a selected bibliography that is worthwhile to have on your shelf.  Since this book was written in 2003, the bibliography is chock full of RECENT books on urban studies that allow the student or casual reader to follow up in any number of directions.<br />Worth checking out.	2004-07-16

By &quot;western&quot; were mostly talking &quot;French&quot;, although Aries does include digressions into German, Italian, Spanish, English and American culture.  I didn't find the intense focus on France to detract from the overall majesty of this 600+ page opus.  For most of the thousand years, the &quot;attitude towards death&quot; that Aries is describing crosses national boundaires.<br />Aries divides his study into four overlapping historical periods: &quot;The Tame Death&quot;, &quot;The Death of the Self&quot;, &quot;The Death of the Other&quot;, and &quot;The Invisible Death&quot;. The Tame Death roughly corresponds with the pre-Christian and early middle ages. This period was characterized by a meek acceptance of passing into a long period of sleep.  Death is social, and the death ritual has a central place in the society.<br />&quot;The Death of the Self&quot; is moves more into the middle and late middle ages.  Here, death is used by the mendicant orders of Christianity to convert a quasi-pagan population. Thus, there is a corresponding rise in individual's concern with their own death.  Also during this period, there is a rise in materialism, which creates a duality between the love of things and the renunciation of the material world which is supposed to preceed death.<br />The Death of the Other and the Invisible Death are familiar to most modern folks.  The Invisible Death is corresponds with the post WWII American model, and the Death of the Other largely corresponds to the romantic movement (lots of weeping, lots of drama).<br />Aries basic thesis delves into &quot;the Invention of Tradition&quot; territory, i.e. that modern attitudes towards death are just that, modern, and largely without antecedent in history.  Aries also points out that pre-Christian traditions of death have persisted far longer in the west then one might suppose.  His main illustration for this contention is the observations that the concept of &quot;purgatory&quot; was not fully accepted until well into the 17th and 18th century (purgatory being an exclusively Chrisitian concept).<br />The research and execution can only be considered awe inspiring, but the thesis less so.  Any modern reader of history is aware that &quot;tradition&quot; is invented.  Aries is less concerned as to why this might be the case, but for me, the &quot;why&quot; is the interesting question.ain illustration for this contention is the observations that the concept of &quot;purgatory&quot; was not fully accepted until well into the 17th and 18th century (purgatory being an exclusively Chrisitian concept).<br />The research and execution can only be considered awe inspiring, but the thesis less so.

Makes for a light, enjoyable read, but Beam rarely teases out the interesting insights that arise from his excellent access to the inner workings of America's &quot;Premier&quot; mental hospital.<br />This book will make you think about the (troubled) history of psychiatry/ treatment of mental illness, and Beam's portrait of this institution caused me to shed no tears for the fall of this fabled refuge for blue blooded loons.<br />Reading interviews with &quot;graduates&quot;, its hard not to question the assumptions that underlied McLean's very reasons for existence.  Few of the individuals profiled within seem like they were ever a &quot;danger to self or others&quot;.  Indeed, when a rash of suicides hit McLean a couple of decades ago, the staff were singularly unprepared to cope.  Perhaps this is because the &quot;inmates&quot; were not as bad off as one might suppose?<br />Makes an interesting companion piece for Goffman's &quot;Asylums&quot;.	2004-07-06

This is that book, although the publishing date on my copy was the early 70s, making this book more than 30 years out of date.<br />Book provides interesting coverage of the area, including little known details like the prehistoric oyster fields in the imperial valley and the old haunts of &quot;desert Steve&quot;.  Main criticism, aside from the age, is the complete lack of any maps.  I believe a guidebook should include maps for the covered area.<br />It would be nice if there was something more recent in print for this area.	2004-06-28

This is the third book by Goffman that I've read (others: Stigma, Asylums).  In this book, Goffman elucidates a &quot;dramaturgical&quot; theory of self, which he claims is an additional method of explaining human action.<br />First caveat, I've not read any books by Talcott Parsons, or Manheim, and there were several sections in this book that were heavy enough in theory to make me give up.  Despite these difficult sections, Goffman's style is breezy and interesting enough to make th is book worth reading for a layman.<br />Roughly, Goffman sets up a model of human interaction that takes most of its metaphors from the realm of theatrical performance.  Human interaction takes place between performers and audiences, interactions happen front stage or back stage.  This theatrical metaphor is joined by the idea that human actors interact in teams that share similar motives and values.  He joins this &quot;team&quot; idea to the theatrical metaphor by emphasizing the difference between performers and audiences.<br />After laying out his framework, Goffman then uses examples from literature, his own research, and other researchers to illustrate his point.  It is in this section that his writing can seem a bit dated.  For example, he repeatedly discusses how college educated women will &quot;play dumb&quot; for their boy friends.  I'm not saying this doesn't (still) happen, but the example could use somet updating.<br />One of the main insights that I took away from this excellent book is that humans largely exist as social beings through their interactions with other creatures, and the idea of a person as an &quot;individual&quot; is, itself, largely a construct. This largely contradicts much of the books/music I imbibed as a teen and young adult (Ayn Rand, punk rock, I'm looking at you).<br />It also seems to me that this &quot;dramaturgical&quot; perspective is a thesis that has been widely adopted by the self-help movement.  Perhaps I will now explore some of that (voluminous) literature.  Perhaps not.<br />This book is not without it's more disquieting moments.  One thought this book led me to is that the important thing in life is the maintaining of whatever appearance one is required to maintaining.  So long as that appearance is maintained, what lies underneath (i.e. the traditional concept of self or personality) is effectively unimportant.  If we are only what are interactions with others make us, then what we think/feel on the inside and don't share with others, matters not at all.<br />Goffman himself explains that the dramaturgical perspective is merely another aspect of a larger attempt to explain human action in terms of human INTERaction, but for me, it has great explanatory weight.a thesis that has been widely adopted by the self-help movement.

Dense but short, \\"Changes in the Land\\" gives a close reading to the ecological impact of British colonization in New England.  As Cronon states in his conclusion, this transformation has ramifications far outside New England, since the environmental degradation that accompanied early colonization forced settlers farther and farther afield.<br />Twenty years after it was published, the scholarship is still, what I would consider \\"cutting edge\\".  Cronon cuts across disciplines and primary sources to produce a nuanced model of the interrelationship of humans and the environment.  Cronon's work is just as interesting for his (to me, anyway) novel technique of writing a history where the personalities of humans take a back seat to the consequnces of their decisions.<br />The effect is at once radical and main stream.  Radical, in that Cronon strips away traditional justifications for human decisions that reinforce the implicit assumptions that cause those same decisions.  Main stream, in that he manages to stay away from the hyperbole and argument that plague revisions of history.<br />I've also read Cronon's \\"Nature's Metropolis\\", which is his book about the development of the city of Chicago. I would recommend that book, as well as this one, to anyone interested in the subjects that Cronon covers.  His scholarship is top notch.	2004-05-27

Handy to have around.  Certainly the most comprehensive (and only) guide to San Diego architecture that I've been able to find. Well organized with plenty of pictures and addresses.  Also contains several mini-narratives of regional history.<br />Sutro isn't biased towards one or more specific time periods as compared to other time periods.  This suprised me, but I guess it reflects his attempt to be even handed (I also noted that the Publisher is supported by several developers).  Whatever, Sutro's credentials are bonafide as a journalist, so I won't quibble.<br />Still, it was a little bit shocking to hear him waxing enthusiasticly about some of the more recent condo developments downtown.<br />Also, I saw an unaddressed picture of a Victorian in the Bankers Hill section of the book that has been moved to Golden Hill.  I wasn't sure what was up with that.<br />Perhaps the coolest part of this book is reading about the past (often bawdy) history of some of the buildings in Downtown and the East Village.  For instance, they used to keep zoo animals in the basement of the Granger Building (5th and Broadway), and the Jerome's Furniture warehouse at fifteenth and Broadway was once a venue where people watched boxing and wrestling matches!<br />Another highlight is his section on the East County region.  I was fairly dissapointed with the coverage of areas like Del Mar and National City.<br />All criticism aside, the subject matter, clear organization and over all usefulnesss make this book a &quot;must have&quot; for anyone interested in the subject.	2004-05-25

Folkways are the &quot;ways of life&quot; that combine to create a distinct cultures.  In turn, those distinct cultures combine to create our society.<br />Fischer identifies four relevant folkways: the Puritans of New England, the Cavaliers of Virginia, the Quakers of the Delaware Valley and the Borderers (or Scotch Irish) of the back country.<br />The most extraordinary part of this long, long book was the manner in which Fischer was able to unpack the regional cultures of the British Isles.  As Fischer himself remarks, British historians and social scientists have devoted negligible time and attention to regional culture (as supposed to strictly &quot;local&quot; culture, which is often covered in Britain).<br />Once Fischer links up the regions in England with their counter parts in America, the once obscure has become obvious.  This, I believe, is one of the hallmarks of excellent scholarship.<br />It's almost impossible to critize anything about this book until the last hundred pages, when Fischer blithely asserts that all events for the past three hundred years are eminently explainable in terms of the four folkways of this book.<br />I was suprised to see him reach so far, especially since this is &quot;volume 1&quot; of a &quot;proposed five volume set&quot;.  Since this book was published fifteen years ago, I guess we'll have to be patient while we wait for, &quot;The Ebony Tree: African Folkways in America&quot;<br />, volume two of the set.<br />Still, this book was near revelatory in both method and analysis.	2004-05-21

As the existnece of this book indicates, McDougall answered his own doubts.<br />The book is built around the central thesis that &quot;America is a nation of hustlers&quot;.  McDougall's central insight proves to be fresh and interesting enough to carry subject matter that has (as the author admits) been covered many times before.<br />His sythesis of recent scholarship in the field of American History is top notch, and the notes alone make the book worth the cover price.  Interested readers will find hundreds of jumping off points for further exploration in the field of merican history.<br />McDougall is cognizant of the diversity of &quot;histories&quot; which have multiplied in recent years.  He includes citations to and summaries of gender and ethnic histories that demonstrate his familiarity with recent scholarship.<br />At the same time, he drops footnotes lauding Huntington (a historian favored by conservatives) and certainly doesn't shy away from the &quot;great man&quot; school of scholarship.<br />I especially enjoyed the treatment of the links between intellectual history in Britain in the pre-revolutinary era with the developments in America leading up to the revolution.<br />On the whole, this is a balanced, nuanced reading of American history and I anticipate the next chapter(this is projected to be a three volume set).	2004-04-26

I was impressed, frankly and I think I'll read more.<br />Set in the 1880's/90's in Nebraska, this book chronicles the relationship of a young boy/man and the wife of a wealthy local luminary.  As the boy turns into a man, his early admiration for the lady turns into contempt.  Is this about a human relationship or rather a metaphor for the rise and decline of the plains economy in the aftermath of the railroad?  Maybe both.<br />One interesting aspect about this book, and, I suppose, all of Cather's work, is that she is writing about a period some twenty or thirty years prior to the era when she was writing.  I thought that was pretty cool.  She seems like an early example of the &quot;New Yorker&quot; style fiction writer.<br />Good stuff.	2004-04-09

Yes, this certainly is a classic in urban history.  Fogelson succicently tells the story of Los Angeles, from it's beginnings as a Mexican backwater berg to the enormous Metropolis it became.  Fogelson includes chapters on all of the important subjects: L.A. and its Mexican roots, the quest for water, the signifigance of new modes of transportation, the failure of the light water system, the development of the board, the conflict with San Diego, the public utility movement and, of course, the progressive movement.<br />Fogelson's history is academic in tone, but it's just such concise and well documented writing that you have to love it.  A must for readers of Southern California history.  I might add that although this was a book about L.A., the chapter on the L.A./SD conflict for Southern California supremacy was actually the best thing I've been able to dig up thus far on San Diego history!  How about that, huh?<br />I might also add that you might want to track down a first edition  hardback of this book, rather then paying for this overpriced reprint.  The original hardback is handsomely designed and makes a fine edition to your book shelve.	2004-04-08

Starting in the neolithic era, Mumford marches through all of recorded time and place (place being limited to the Near East, Greece, Rome, Europe and America) to bring, you, the reader, his thoughts on the role and &quot;prospects&quot; of the city.<br />In the beginning, it's an exhilerating ride.  Mumford is not shy about advancing bold arguments.  Although the book starts with sections on the city in Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, he doesn't really get excited until he gets to Ancient Greece.  I'd say it's clear from the text that Mumford is a fan of Ancient Greece, particularly Athens between the 7th and 6th century B.C.<br />Then it's off to Rome.  Mumford is a harsh critic of Roman culture.  His critique of the Roman method of burial (take bodies just outside city limits, dump, bury) contrains so much righteous indigination you might think the Romans were still pottering around when he wrote this book.<br />After Rome, we get an equally stirring defense of the Middle (don't call them &quot;Dark&quot; around Mumford) Ages.  Mumford is a big fan of the city in the late middle ages.  As an example, Mumford uses Amsterdam.  Specifically, what Mumford likes about this time period is the community involvement by the ruling elites.<br />Like many other social critics, Mumford is not a huge fan of the impact that capitalism and industrialization have had on the modern city.  Unlike some of the other reveiwers below, I don't really hold that against him.  He was writing in the sixties, people!!!<br />However, I do admit that by the last hundred or so pages, when Mumford starts despairing of the future of the city, the whole tirade started to get tired.<br />I'm not sure I would recommend this for a general reader.	2004-04-05

Starr hits his stride in this, his third in his epic series on the history of California.  At last, Starr is free to focus on the subject that any reader can tell is &quot;near and dear&quot; to his heart: The emergence of Los Angeles as a full blown titan of a city.  Although the subtitle to this book is &quot;Southern California Through the 1920's&quot;, once again, it would be be more appropriate to hone in on the main subject and retitle the book &quot;Los Angeles and Two Chapters on Santa Barbara Through the 1920's&quot;.<br />Again, not that I'm complaining.  Perhaps because of Starr's intent focus on a single city, his talent really shines in this volume.  This is one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in the last year.<br />The first section of the book deals with Southern California and Water.  His sub chapter on the Imperial Valley is a real barn burner.  I've never read such a complete account of the events in Imperial Valley in the early 20th century, and I would recommend the book for that reason alone.<br />The second and third sections tackle the emergence of Los Angeles society.  Here, Starr goes on the offensive, tackling the idea that L.A. is a cultural wasteland.  You can almost hear the voice of a professor lecturing undergraduates.  Starr starts at economic institutions, discusses the people of Los Angeles and ends with a discussion of cultural institutions.  The end of the third section deals with the &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; alternative.<br />For me, these two chapters were the least enjoyable in the book.<br />Fortunately, Starr rebounds with his treatment of literary and &quot;biblio&quot; society in LA.  These chapters make for fascinating reading, and were a high point of the entire series.  I certainly did not know that LA was a center of the rare book trade!	2004-03-17

Even though I don't really enjoy reading him at times, I can't stay away.  This is the third Dreiser book I've read (The other two: The Titan, and Sister Carrie).  I would certainly recommend Sister Carrie over The Financier, but I would recommend this book over its succesor, The Titan.<br />The Financier is the by now familiar tale of the rise/fall/rise of an aspiring financial tycoon.  The only difference between Frank Cowperwood (protagonist of The Financier) and the Gordon Gecko of 80's &quot;Wall Street&quot; fame, is that Cowperwood is working in the 1860's , not the 1980's and he lives in Philly, not NYC.<br />Cowperwood is the son of a bank vice president.  He posseses a preternatural gift for finance and an, ahem, well developed, sense of self interest.  Cowperwood is the sort of Spencerian/ Darwinian/Nietchzian &quot;super man&quot; that is as common in early twentieth century American fiction as the self obsessed yuppie has become in early twenty first century American television.<br />Cowperwood's catch phrase during this book is &quot;I satisfy myself.&quot; Personally, I found that phrase a tad redolent of omanism, if you know what I mean, but I'm sure Dreiser had the purest of intentions at the time.<br />The plot of the book concerns machinations involving Cowperwood and his handling of city bonds.  I know, it sounds dry.  Well, it is dry, and boring, especially for the first hundred and fifty pages, where Dresier seems intent on teaching the readers all about the operation of financial markets in Philly in the 1860's.<br />The story picks up when a fire hits Chicago, and Cowperwood's shenanigans are detected.  Cowperwood is then tried, convicted and sent to prison.  It's a good time.  Makes for fun reading.<br />Of almost equal importance is Cowperwood's penchant for the illicit affair.  His courtship of Aileen Butler, the daughter of one of his patrons, absorbs a good forty percent of the book.  In &quot;The Titan&quot;, Butler becomes his wife when they move to Chicago.<br />Overall, I'd say the book is worth checking out if only for Dreiser's reportage.  You can practically taste the 1860's.  Also notable is his expert discussion of financial markets in that period, and I might add, his lovely descrption of conditions at the Eastern Pentitentiary.<br />Check it out.<br />If you like this book, you might also want to check out the Titan, Sister Carrie, Frank Norris's &quot;The Pit&quot; and that same author's &quot;The Octopus&quot;, for similarly themed work.ler becomes his wife when they move to Chicago.<BR>Overall, I'd say the book is worth checking out if only for Dreiser's reportage.

Not that I have a problem with that.  This is the second volume in Starr's definitive six volume history of California.  Starr writes history that combines straight forward &quot;who, what, when&quot; facts with digressions into literary criticism and pyschologlogical speculation.  This is a blend that is quite apt for California, and I have found volume one and two to be rewarding.<br /> Starr (who is also the state librarian for California) also includes excellent essays on his sources for each chapter, which makes further reading a snap!  For example, after reading his first volume &quot;Americans and the Californian Dream&quot;, I read &quot;The Octopus&quot; by Frank Norris and &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; by Dana.<br />This book covers roughly the same time period as the first volume, and there is some overlap.  After all, there wasn't THAT much going on in California from 1850 to 1900.  However, while the first volume focuses almost totally on Northern California, this volume focuses almost totally on Southern California.<br />And by Southern California, I mean Los Angeles, with a little bit of Riverside thrown in.  As a native of San Francisco and a current resident of San Diego, I simply couldn't believe at how little San Diego county came in for mention.  Again, I'm hesitant to label this as a criticism, since I did love the book, but I just wonder what San Diego did (or didn't do) to get left out.<br />Starr spends ample time covering pre-American Southern California history.  He charts the development of California agriculture, talks about the &quot;Craftsman&quot; movement and, as his wont, spends entire chapters talking about the artists and boosters of the time.  Personally, after reading this book I have resolved to read at  least one book of Mary Austin.<br />Towards the end of this volume Starr dishes out a hefty dose of the history of the Progressive movement in California.

Well, I'm in the market for a car, and reading this book was sort-of an eye opener.  Bradsher indicts SUV's for a host of crimes, but I can't imagine his case converting many who didn't agree with his charges prior to reading this book.  You might want to file &quot;High and Mighty&quot; in the &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; section with &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; and &quot;Earth in the Balance&quot;.<br />That being said, it is a well researched, informative book.  Bradsher isn't afraid to criticize the environmental movement, which he believes was co-opted by the sophisticated marketing of the auto industry.  His chapters on the history and development of the SUV are first rate.  Also interesting was his thorough documentation of the POSITIVE effect the SUV has had on communities in the United States where these behemoths are built. These descriptions, coupled with a tendency for Bradsher to assert harms in the future tense, combine to diminish the strength of his over all argument: that SUV's are baaaaaaaaad.<br />One thing is for certain: SUV's benefited from a series of regulatory loopholes designed to benefit &quot;light trucks&quot;.  The very existence of these loopholes are detrimental to the safety and health of American drivers, and action should be take to amend them forthwith.	2004-02-10
US	52547402	R1FCPCVVHJMUR5	0140187707	727863547	The Octopus: A Story of California (Twentieth Century Classics) (v. 1)	Books	3	8	10	N	Y	A Novel Rich with Loamy Irony	Certainly a novel with a capital &quot;N&quot;, from a time when authors wrote grand, sweeping, &quot;epics of the soil and those who work the soil&quot;.  Norris was inspired by the work of French novelist Zola, which is funny because some of his harshest writing takes to task San Francisco society matrons attempting to appreciate French style landscape art.<br />I read this book after reading Kevin Starr's &quot;Californians and the American Dream&quot;.  While this novel does culminate in a retelling of the infamous &quot;Mussel Slough&quot; shoot out, where a group of &quot;squatting&quot; ranchers shot it out with representatives of the U.S. government and the Marshalls, it is most notable for its classic descriptions of California ranch life circa 1880.<br />The character's at the center of the Octopus are broad: Vanamee, the &quot;Hebraic&quot; looking sheep herder/mystic who yearns for the sweet embrace of his departed lover; Presley, the would-be poet who gets wrapped up in the affairs of the world, only to turn away from the world in the end; Annixter, the rough-hewn young rancher who is transformed by the love of a woman.<br />The Octopus is also notable for the supporting cast of minor characters.  They reveal as much about life in California in the 1800's as do the major characters.<br />Still relevant for its historical value, but let's face it... the prose is dated.  Also, I agree with other reviewers in that this book is too long by about a hundred pages.  Probably a must read for people who are serious about the history of California.	2004-01-29

Huzzah!<br />This book is a survey of the role of gentleman in English society through history.  Castronovo &quot;opens up&quot;(a favorite phrase of his) the gentleman as a concept.  Central to this book are the different layers of &quot;what it means to be a gentleman&quot; throughout time.  He starts with midevial times, tracing the evolution of the word &quot;gentleman&quot;.  He then talks about the gentleman as nobility, the gentleman as property owner, the gentleman as a rich person, and so on and so forth.<br />My favorite section of the book (by far) was his treatment of the gentleman as dandy.  His description of the life of Beau Brummell left me clamoring for more (&quot;People would come and watch his extraordinary toillete each morning&quot;).  Fun!<br />This book is short (130 pages) with a full accompaniment of notes and an excellent bibliography that makes purchase of this book worthwhile, in and of itself.<br />There are also a section of black and white photographs that document the gentleman in (English) art.<br />I also note that the same author has published a companion book, the &quot;American Gentleman&quot;.	2004-01-22

Jacobs received extraordinary access to prisoners, guards, staff and records at Stateville. This access, coupled with his dual background is sociology and law, makes for a compelling book.<br />I held off reading this book for a month after I received it, mostly because I was concerned that it would be dated.  The book ends in 1975.  None the less, I still came away with a sense that age takes nothing away from Jacob's thesis.  Jacobs uses a historical approach to document several phases in the life of the prison as an institution.<br />He starts in the early 20th century, when the prison was used as a source for political patronage and &quot;anarchy ruled.&quot;  This phases was followed by the authoritatian regime of Warden Ragen.  Ragen takes center stage as the most compelling figure in the book.  While one might expect Ragen to come across as an midevial ogre, quite the opposite is true.  Jacobs demonstrates that while Ragen had his harsh moments, prisoners were actually treated as well and sometimes better during his 25 year long tenure.<br />Ragen's &quot;authoritaianism&quot; is followed by the emergence of the bureocratic &quot;legal-rational&quot; regime of the 60's and 70's.  Again, where one might expect Jacobs to be most sympathetic, he suprises.  He paints a picture of an insitution in decline.  Although the ideology of the new regime is &quot;prisoner friendly&quot;, the prisoners actually suffer from a decline in quality of life.<br />The final phase of the prison concerns the introduction of Chicago &quot;super-gangs&quot;.  In this section, Jacobs is like a man standing at the lip of the Grand Canyon.  Obviously, you don't need to be a sociologist to know that gangs are THE story in corrections over the last thirty years.  You can hardly blame Jacobs for not focusing more on this theme.  After all, gangs had just begun to infiltrate in the time he was writing.<br />The conclusions of this book will suprise most readers.conclusions of this book will suprise most readers.	2004-01-20

I believe this book is widely acknowledged as a classic in the field of California history, and I certainly wouldn't disagree with that judgment.<br />Prof. Starr attempts to illuminate the psychology of early California by providing mini-biographies of important California residents.  These biographies are linked together by several recurrent themes.  It is these themes that provide the thesis (theses?) of the book.<br />The themes are:  The dark side of the optomism which characterizes the &quot;California&quot; personality; the harsh conflict in early times which affected the development of a Californian &quot;civilisation&quot; and the melding of cultures (Mexican and Californian, Northern and Southern) that produced Californian culture.<br />Starr focuses more on cultural rather then economic or political figures.  Starr also shows a fondness for somewhat Freudian explanations for behavior (repressive parents, absent parents, neglectful parents).  Given the age of the book (1975) it's hard to quibble with the inclusion of a perspective tilted towards psychological explanation.<br />On the whole it was a worthwhile read, and not too dense either. Recommended for those interested in the history of California and it's culture.	2004-01-13

Can't say I regret the experience, though.  Truly , this is a masterpiece, both in terms of its substance and its approach.  I could quite easily write more then a thousand words on this book, but hey, this is Amazon, right?<br />Before I begin, I would like to state up front that I am not a historian or a graduate student of history.  Please forgive me if my review contains incorrect statements.<br />&quot;The Making of the English Working Class&quot; is precisely what its (awkward) title describes: a history of the developments leading to the emergence of the modern industrial working class in England (and Scotland, sort of.  Wales and Ireland are excluded, although Irish immigrants living in England to figure in some parts of the book).  The time period covered is roughly the 1790's to the 1840's.  Thompson starts with a description of &quot;Dissent&quot;, discusses the influence of the French Revolution on that tradition (Dissent), spends a good chunk of the book describing the effect of the industrial revolution on the lives and lifestyles of the workers in industrial England, and then spends an equal amount of time describing the reaction of the workers and their leaders to this adjustment in circumstances.<br />Along the way, Thompson takes a hatchet to historians on the left, right, and center.  His section on the change in circumstances of the workers in England is most critical of writers like F.A. Hayek, i.e. those writers who try to say that the industrial revolution &quot;wasn't that bad&quot; or &quot;wasn't bad at all&quot; for the workers.  He devotes a good part of Part II of the book to attacking the methods of statistical or economic history.  His preference is to use documentary evidence of the time.  In this way, the book (published in the 60's) is a forerunner of historical &quot;postmodernism&quot;(Oh, please forgive me for the term), where authors abandon &quot;objective&quot; evidence (economic statistics) in favor of &quot;subjective&quot; evidence (pamphlets, letters and newspapers).<br />I guess that's hardly a revolutinary arguement now-a-day, but back then, I can hardly imagine.<br />His section on the reaction of workers to the industrial revolution is rather more critical to historians of the left and center, who sought to discount the violence associated with the Luddite movement as somehow unrepresentative of the working class movement in England.  Thompson's revisionist history of the Luddite movement is a tour de force.  Really, it's breathtaking.<br />In my opinion, the book kind of loses steam after that section. Thompson has some harsh words for the London based &quot;leaders&quot; of the workers movement, and I felt his discussion of Owenism left too much to the readers imagination.  I don't suppose this book was meant for someone with only a loose grounding in English history, but none the less, that's what I have, so I'm just stuck.<br />To the extent that I have anything critical to say about this book, it's that Thompson at times presupposes a graduate level education in English history.  I haven't read AJP Taylor or Hayek or any of the other authors Thompson attacks.  IN the end, though, I felt like it didn't hurt my enjoyment of this book.  I would highly recommend it, although you should set aside a good chunk of time to make your way from beginning to end.;objective&quot; evidence (economic statistics) in favor of &quot;subjective&quot; evidence (pamphlets, letters and newspapers).<br />I guess that's hardly a revolutinary arguement now-a-day, but back then, I can hardly imagine.<BR>His section on the reaction of workers to the industrial revolution is rather more critical to historians of the left and center, who sought to discount the violence associated with the Luddite movement as somehow unrepresentative of the working class movement in England.

Rothman advances an argument to explain why America turned to instituionalization of different classes of people during the Jacksonian period.  His basic thesis is that medical elites feared the growing democratization of American society and therefore advanced the idea that institutionalization could make unproductive citizens productive and simletaneously serve as a model for the rest of the society.<br />In Rothman's model, the &quot;Discovery of the Asylum&quot; was both a progressive and deeply conservative event.  This conflict is never resolved, and was ultimately at the root of the great failure of the rehabilative model of insitutionalization in the post civil war period.  Rothman persuaively argues that by the 1880's, the idea that individuals could be rehabilitated by the process of instituionalization had been abandoned in favor of a &quot;custodial&quot; model.<br />Rothman looks at the examples of poor houses, pentientaries, orphanages and insane asylums to explicate his thesis.<br />Fans of Foucault's &quot;Discipline and Punishment&quot;,  Goffman's &quot;Asylums&quot; and Sykes &quot;The Society of Captives&quot; should find this book enthralling.<br />Highly recommended	2003-11-26

Abbott is a symbol for the excesses of New York style limosine liberalism.  Wealthy author becomes pen pals with convicted felon, publishes book of felon's letters, felon becomes cause celebre, author gets felon out of prison, felon kills someone while out, felon goes back to prison.<br />The main thing I'd like to address is the idea of Abbott as a &quot;hardened criminal&quot; as he is referred to repeatedly in the other reviews.<br />Nowadays, folks in the know don't call people &quot;hardened criminals&quot;.  The modern term is &quot;career offender&quot;.  I find both terms interesting.  For the first term, I would like to ask the question: What is the difference between a &quot;hardened&quot; criminal and a &quot;Non-hardened&quot; criminal?  Well, a hardened criminal has been to prison.  Also: When does a regular offender become a &quot;career&quot; offender?  Not to belabor the point, but once a prisoner becomes &quot;hardened&quot; or a &quot;career offender&quot;, the odds are that he or she will spend the rest of their lives behind bars.<br />People who have not been convicted of a felony like to judge those who do.  Judging others makes us feel better about ourselves.  It's harder to empthasize with the stigmatized then with normals.<br />I think it is important to point out that the juvenille justice system in which Abbott came of age was, by modern standard, barbaric.  Abbott was obviously insitutionalized from a very early age, and he stayed that way.  How can we blame Abbott for internalizing the message that society sent him from the time he was twelve?<br />Abbott should be celebrated, if only because he struggled against the label society gave him.  That he failed in his struggle speaks not to any weakness of character on his part, it just means that he's a normal person who doesn't always succeed.al person who doesn't always succeed.	2003-11-11

I was suprised by how brilliant &quot;Asylums&quot; was, so I picked up &quot;Stigma&quot;.  I was similarily impressed with Stigma.<br />Where &quot;Asylums&quot; dealt with the relationship of individuals and institutions, &quot;Stigma&quot; deals more with inter personal relationships.  The role of instituions in forming identity is noted in footnotes throughout, but the primary focus is in discussing the relationship between identity and stigma.<br />Goffman, of course, defines the dickens out of his concepts.  If you gain nothing else from this book, you will have a thorough understanding of what it means to have a &quot;stigma&quot;.  The heart of the book consists of Goffman defining a five phase process which individuals with stigma go through.  First you learn what it is to be &quot;normal&quot;.  Then you learn you're not &quot;normal&quot;.  Then you learn to control disclosure of information about your stigma, then you learn to &quot;pass&quot; as someone without a stigma and then you learn how to &quot;voluntarily disclose&quot; your stigma.<br />I don't have a degree in sociology, so I'm not sure about the theoretical backgrounding of this approach, but it made sense to me.<br />The best part of this book was the end, where Goffman argues (persuaively, I thought) that even &quot;Normal&quot; people have to deal with some sort of stigma at some time in their life.  In that way, by studying people with stigma we study the interactions of &quot;normals&quot; with each other. So really there's no difference, just a continuum of stigma, ranging from those who are always suffering frm stigma, to those who rarely ever have to deal with it.<br />I thought that was an interesting insight.  I recommend this book highly, and I look forward to reading his classic: &quot;The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.&quot;/>I thought that was an interesting insight.

I highly recommend it for all of those interested in American History, Cultural Studies and Sociology.<br />The purpose of this book is to demonstrate the development of the American myth of the &quot;Garden of the World&quot;.  Smith argues (persuaively) that the idea of the American continent as a garden: fertile, lush and tamed(or tameable), deeply influenced the course of American history.<br />As Leo Marx said in his similarly awesome &quot;The Machine in the Garden&quot;, the brillance of this book lies in how Smith demonstrates how ideology drives action (or, alternatively: how ideas drive behavior).<br />Smith divides &quot;Virgin Land&quot; into three parts.  Part One &quot;Passage to India&quot; describes the initial path westward and the philosophy of the individuals who pushed for westward expansion (Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Hart Benton, Asa WHitney, William Gilpin and Walt Whitman). By way of a prologue, Smith notes that the idea of &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; did not develop as soon as the settlers arrived, but rather was developed by American Philosophers and Politicans (and land speculators).  In the first Part, Smith describes how the initial push westward was justified via the idea that a passage west would increase trade with the Orient.  Smith notes that this idea dervied from 18th century Mercantilist economic theory and was therefore &quot;archaic&quot; (a favorite term of Smith's in this book) from the very beginning.<br />The Second part of the book (&quot;The Sons of Leatherstocking&quot;) uses the literary character of Leatherstocking as an entry point for a discussion of the development of the western hero figure in literature.<br />A highlight of the book comes in Chapter Ten when Smith discusses the &quot;Dime Novel Heroine&quot;. I found his discussion illuminating.<br />In the third and final part of the book, Smith lays out the characterstics of American Agarianism which would come to define westward expansion after the Civil War.  Smith outlines the conflict between Southern Pastoralism and Nort/Western &quot;Yeoman&quot; Agarianism and notes how the Homestead Act was singularly influenced by this second conception of American settlement.  He also documents how this same philosophy of agarianism prevented later reform of the Homestead Act even after it became clear to many that the Homestead Act had failed miserably in its goals.<br />Smith also discusses the struggle by authors to develop authentic western &quot;characters&quot; and relates that struggle to the emegerence of the &quot;Garden of the World&quot; symbol.<br />This really isn't the forum to tease out all the different issues presented, thoughtfully, in this classic book.

US	52547402	RR6GC6OWUEWFW	0520031946	981090241	Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait	Books	5	27	27	N	Y	Brilliant, A Classic: A Must Read for Weber Fans	I want to give a shout out to Henri Edward Dongieux who authored the Amazon.com guide to &quot;get to know Weber and Habermas&quot;.  I want to give my stand disclaimer: I am not a sociologist or a student of sociology, just a general reader with an interest in the history of ideas.<br />Funny story about this book: I bought Weber's theory of social and economic organization (with the foreword by Talcott Parsons).  I don't know what I was thinking there.  I read about thirty pages of Parsons introduction to Theory and was like, &quot;forget this.&quot;<br />So then the next day I'm surfing around Amazon trying to figure out how I'm going to figure out Weber and I see the above mentioned list.  Well, Henri was right: this book is THE place to start if you're looking to access the ideas of Weber.<br />One further digression before I actually review the book itself: Weber is hard to access for a couple of reasons: First, all his stuff has been translated from the German.  This is compounded by the fact that Weber, despite his highly rigorous thought, was kind of making up terminology as he went and also by the fact that German has tons of words that don't translate well into English.<br />Second, Weber kind of died before he finished pulling together the various strands of his grand theory together, leaving his work uncomplete.<br />So, preliminary matters aside, I will move on to a description of the book.  Since this is the first review of this work on Amazon (and how can that be?). I will provide a non-judgmental description of content and then a few observations.<br />The book is divided into three Parts. Part One is called &quot;German Society and The Protestant Ethic&quot;.  Part Two is &quot;Society, Religion, and Secular Ethic: A Comparitive Study of Civilisations&quot; and Part Three is &quot;Domination, Organization, and Legitimacy: Max Weber's Political Sociology&quot;.  Before Part One, Bendix includes an introduction and a chapter on Weber's &quot;Career and Personal Orientation&quot;.  That first chapter is most illuminating and serves to ground Weber in place and time.<br />The first part of the book is divided into two chapters.  The first chapter talks about his very interesting early studies of eastern german agarian society and the various german stock exchanges. Bendix refers to these two early studies over and over through out the book.  The second chapter of the first part of the book discusses Weber's most popular and well known ideas about the protestant work ethic and the spirit of capitalism.  Having laid out the touchstones of Weber's work, Bendix moves into part two, which concern Weber's studies of world religion.<br />Part two deals exclusively with Weber's interest in world religion.  Bendix devotes a chapter each to his studies of China, India and Palestine.  Bendix notes that it is obvious that Weber's main interest was in the roots of the west that he found in Palestine and so the chapters on China and India are of limited use (except as a guide to what Weber THOUGHT about China and Indian religion.  Bendix concludes part two with a chapter summarizing Weber's &quot;sociology of religion&quot;.<br />Part three has a similar structure to part two. Bendix runs off a couple of chapters on charsmatic domination and traditional domination as a means to explicate Weber's theories of &quot;Legal Domination&quot; which represent, perhaps, Weber's main achievment.  Again, Bendix points out that Weber's interest in chasmatic domination and traditional domination are really only &quot;foils&quot; for his overriding interest in &quot;legal domination&quot;, in the same way that his studies of India and China are foils for his interest in the society of ancient Palestine.<br />In part three, Bendix also includes a couple of chapters that tie the book together and link the three parts, as well as a further attempt to ground Weber in the thought of his day.<br />OK, so that is the descriptive part.  Now, some observations:<br />First off, as someone who really didn't know anything about Weber's thought (outside of a cursory understanding of his thesis in the &quot;Spirit of Capitalism&quot;), I found this book to be immensely compelling.<br />One can dismiss all of Weber's substantive conclusions about the nature of society and government and still be Wowed by the tremendous influence he has had on all social thinkers in the past century.  I now see Weber's influence everywhere I look!<br />I also feel like any further attempts to read Weber will be made about a thousand times easier becaue I have read this book.<br />Although I read all but about twenty pages of this five hundred page book, I believe one could derive the same meaning from reading chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12,13, and 15, while skipping the rest.<br />This book also has a handy index!ervations:<br />First off, as someone who really didn't know anything about Weber's thought (outside of a cursory understanding of his thesis in the &quot;Spirit of Capitalism&quot;), I found this book to be immensely compelling.  <br />One can dismiss all of Weber's substantive conclusions about the nature of society and government and still be Wowed by the tremendous influence he has had on all social thinkers in the past century.

I can honestly say that my understanding of this work has grown with each reading, but that growth in comprehension has come more from my reading of other books either discussing or related to Discipline and Punish.<br />Specifically, I would recommend Jurgen Habermas's critique of Foucault, although I now forget which book of his contains his critique.  I would also recommend Goffman's &quot;Asylums&quot; and Sykes &quot;The Society of the Prison&quot; as works which can illuminate Foucault's oft dense prose.<br />Foucault's main thesis is that the transistion of society into modernity has resulted in institutions which are increasingly devoted to the control of the &quot;inmate's&quot; time.  The instituions use this control of time to develop discipline.  Discipline is then used to both reinforce the strength of the instituion and also to expand the reach of institution's into the community.<br />As other reviewers have noted, this book isn't really about Prisons.  Rather, the development of the modern prison represents the pinnacle of the relationship between power and discipline.  Foucault leads up to his discussion of the prison by examining developments in other instituions: the work shop, the school and the barracks.<br />I really would encourage admirers of this work to read Goffman's &quot;Asylums&quot;.  The two books overlap to a considerable degree, but they both complement one another.	2003-10-06

Hard to believe given the number of used copies available.  Surely many have read &quot;Society of Captives&quot;?<br />Sykes uses the sociological framework of Talcott Parsons to analyze the &quot;life of prison&quot; in terms of its effects on the inmates.  Sykes was obviously a key reference point for Goffman's work in &quot;Asylums&quot;.  Sykes works around the idea of describing a maximum security prison as a &quot;total institution&quot;, but fails to really nail the concept down.<br />He makes some interesting observations about the conflicting motives of guards on the front line of the prison.  I found troubling his conclusion that the level of control sought to be imposed upon the prisoners was ever elusive.  This seemed, to me, to be a justification for the behavior that goes on behind prison walls.<br />His interesting discussion of prison riot and rebellion prefigures some of Foucault's analysis in &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;.  In fact, I picked up my copy of Discipline and Punish immediately after (and during) reading this book and found the effect to be akin to a light bulb going on in my head.<br />While Sykes lacks the conclusions of Foucault, his simplified analysis of the structure of prison makes reading Foucault's &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; about 100% easier.<br />Here is not the place for a more detailed comparison between the two books.  None the less, any committed reader of Discipline and Punish should feel compelled to digest this book: After all, it only costs a buck and can be read in a single afternoon!	2003-10-03

Rothschild is important not merely because he generated a truly epic amount of wealth for his family, but because he serves as a symbol of the manner in which capitalism changed the lives of those who practiced it.<br />Certainly, the Rothschild clan has been the focus of much anti-semitism and conspiracy theory.  As a Jew, I always felt such talk was ridiculous, but I was interested to find the so-called &quot;grain of truth&quot; which, coupled with a long standing, virulent history of anti-semitism served to transform the Rothschilds into a focus for so much bile.<br />For example, the Rothschild's lent signifigant amounts of capital to the family which held the postal monopoly for the Holy Roman Empire (&quot;Thurn and Taxis&quot; Post).  This relationship enabled the Rothschild's to take advantage of the &quot;intelligence gathering&quot; capabilities of the Postal system to their benefit.<br />This was a theme at the heart of Thomas Pynchon's excellent novel &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;.  Which I recommend to those who enjoyed in this book.<br />Like Niall Ferguson's two part saga of the family history, this book was written in cooperation with the Rothschild family.<br />I recommend this book both for the portrait of the man as well as the portrait of the place and time.	2003-10-02

I read about this book in David Orland's, Prisons: Houses of Darkness, where Orland often referred to Goffman's work in this book.  I was not disappointed.<br />Goffman uses a mixture of field observation and references to literature to describe and critisize the theory and practice of the &quot;Total Institution&quot;.  As the reviewers note below, a &quot;total institution&quot; is an elastic concept.  Goffman focuses on &quot;strong&quot; examples of T.I.'s: the mental hospital, prison, a 19th century man of war, monastery.  Through these &quot;strong&quot; examples he fairly describes the concept and applies it well.<br />Less clear is the implications of Goffman's concept to those institutions which are either &quot;weak&quot; total institutions or non-total institutions with total institution tendencies.  After reading this book, I saw aspects of &quot;total&quot; institutions in almost every institution I cared to think about: schools, churches, courts, etc.<br />I think it is fair to say that &quot;All institutions dream of being total institutions.&quot;  Therefore, this book has application beyond the world of &quot;strong&quot; total institutions. I recommend it highly.	2003-09-30

In that book, Goffman, a sociologist, discusses the rise of \\"Total Institutions\\", i.e. institutions that totally control the lives of those within.  Melville's \\"White Jacket\\" is a book that Goffman often referred to in order to illustrate different aspects of life within the total institution.<br />The introductory essay to this book discusses White Jacket in relationship to the growing bro-ha-ha over slavery, but I thought the book was much more interesting then that.<br />What was most suprising to me, having never read Melville before, was how funny some of the chapters were.  Episodes involving Surgeon Cuticle amputating the leg of an unwilling seaman recall the funniest moments of television shows like Monty Python or the Simpsons.<br />Melville's accurate portrayal of life within the \\"T.I.\\", reminded me of Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\".  There, the setting is an insane asylum, here it is a Man O' Wear, but both books deal with the tactics and strategies an individual might employ when faced with an oppressive living environment.<br />Although I am not sure when, or if, I might try to tackle author's masterpiece 'Moby Dick', I did come away from this book with a profound respect for Melville's capabilities as a writer.  I will no longer take for granted his status among the pantheon of American writers.	2003-09-30

Thus, I would refer all readers of this review to that review.<br />Marx's thesis, roughly stated, is that:  Americans applied idea's developed about landscape in the old world to the landscape they discovered in the new world.  In doing so, the landscape became a &quot;repository of value&quot; (value meaning economic, spiritual, etc.).  The main idea about the landscape that travelled with them from Europe was the idea of &quot;pastoralism&quot;.<br />Pastorialism, roughly expressed, represents the yearning by civilised man to occupy the space in between &quot;art&quot; and &quot;nature&quot;. Marx does an excellent job of explaining the pre-modern understanding of &quot;art&quot; (which is different then our modern understanding of the word).  Marx also distinguishes the a &quot;simple&quot; conception of pastoralism with a &quot;complex&quot; conception.  Using the writings of Jefferson, Marx argues that Americans were more comfortable with the idea of a &quot;complex&quot; pastoralism that acknowledged the conflict inherent in the occupation of a &quot;middle landscape&quot; between art and nature.<br />Marx then attaches the concept of pastoralism to the symbol of the &quot;garden&quot; as representing a mediating space between art and nature (apply &quot;arts&quot; to &quot;nature&quot; and produce a garden).<br />After a further differentiation between the idea of the garden-as-continent vs. garden-as-garden, Marx moves on to the idea of the &quot;machine&quot;.<br />What Marx means by the &quot;machine&quot; of the title is a relationship between culture and industry that was irrevocably altered by the industrial revolution.  He details the attempts by writers to deal with the looming conflict between pastoralism and industrialization.  Perhaps the most interesting portion of the book comes when Marx discusses the period when many saw NO conflict between the &quot;machine&quot; and the &quot;garden&quot;.<br />However, the tour de force comes when Marx analyzes this conflict as it appears in the works of Emerson, Thoureau, Hawthorne, Melville and Fitzgerald.<br />Personally, I thought the analysis of Hawthorne's &quot;Ethan Brand&quot; was first rate.<br />Marx concludes by congratulating the authors he uses for &quot;clarifying&quot; the situation of Americans and noting that the ultimate resolution of the problem of the machine in the garden is not for writer's but for politicans.<br />In this way, the book is significantly more political then one might expect.  It really belongs to the genre of &quot;American Studies&quot;, even though my 1970's edition refers to it as belonging to &quot;Literature&quot;.<br />Marx achieves greatness by tenaciously explpicating the troubled relationship between America and its technology.  Although written in 1964, this book retains great relevance.<br />I highly recommend &quot;The Machine in the Garden&quot;.&quot;machine&quot; and the &quot;garden&quot;.<br />However, the tour de force comes when Marx analyzes this conflict as it appears in the works of Emerson, Thoureau, Hawthorne, Melville and Fitzgerald.<br />Personally, I thought the analysis of Hawthorne's &quot;Ethan Brand&quot; was first rate.<br />Marx concludes by congratulating the authors he uses for &quot;clarifying&quot; the situation of Americans and noting that the ultimate resolution of the problem of the machine in the garden is not for writer's but for politicans.<br />In this way, the book is significantly more political then one might expect.

I picked this bad boy up at the museumstore at SF Moma.  It is a handsome, weighty book, with a beautiful, interesting cover.  The book made a good impression on me.<br />My wife and I decided to buy this book because we have been interested in the theme of \\"landscape as witness\\".  This is a concept we read about in Nancy Spector's accompanying essay in the Cremaster Cycle Guggeinheim museum catalog.  Basically, the idea as it is expressed in Barney interpreted by Spector is that the landscape is a character in the narrative created by art.<br />As a brief survey of Amazon.com will reveal, Lippard is a well regarded writer on art.  Honestly, I'd never heard of her before.  This could have something to do with me not being intimately familiar with the New York City art scene or otherwise involved with the art world except as an occasional museum goer.  Art is sort of at the periphery of my set of interests.<br />None the less, I found this a comprehensive, at times brilliant, survey of both artistic theories about the concept of place as well as a thorough documentation of the specific expressions of these theories in art work.  Lippard's scope of reading and breadth of knowledge about art all over the United States (this book is entirely about the U.S.) is nothing short of stunning.<br />The actual form of the book is a little difficult to explain,  The book has a five part structure, each part with a title: Around Here, Manipulating Memory, Down to Earth: Land Use, The Last Frontiers: City and Suburbs and Looking Around.  Each of these parts contains sub-chapters that are titled with various aspects of the five parts.  Lippard's style is basically to situate each chapter with a brief survey of what other writers have said about the \\"subject\\", followed by a description of different acts of arts intermingled with commentary.  Each of the pages also contains images with substantive critical passages.  Along the top of each page, there is a running essay about the author's experiences growing up in Maine.<br />I found her work to be fairly comprehensive: Although she has end notes and a thorough bibliography, I found myself doubting that any of them so totally nailed the relationship between art and the concept of place.<br />If the author or her representatives are reading this, I would recommend updating this book in another couple of years.<br />Lippard is a self-declared liberal.  Although I did not always agree with her analysis, I admired the manner in which she was able to outline her bias in a non-intrusive way.  She could be more forceful with her arguments.  I don't think anybody could begrudge her opinions.or's experiences growing up in Maine.<br />I found her work to be fairly comprehensive: Although she has end notes and a thorough bibliography, I found myself doubting that any of them so totally nailed the relationship between art and the concept of place.<br />If the author or her representatives are reading this, I would recommend updating this book in another couple of years.<br />Lippard is a self-declared liberal.

So what else is new?<br />One complaint that has already been voiced about this book is that it is not reall \\"about\\" San Francisco at all, but rather makes a point about all cities.  That complaint is true in that author's theoretical underpinings for his argument extend to examples outside of San Francisco.  Really though, what else would the author do?<br />Personally, I found authors attempt to relate San Francisco to Rome and other cities to be interesting and relevant.<br />Another complaint voiced in these reviews is authors tone. That tone has been described as \\"shrill\\".  I would have to concur with that complaint.  I found the tone of this book to be distracting.  I would venture to guess that anyone, ANYONE who reads this book is likely amenable to his \\"Cities suck\\" thesis.  To belabor the point in the manner that author does is just beating a dead horse.<br />In defense of author, he doesn't present himself as a true \\"academic\\" but as a sort of journalist/academic cross-trainer.  I found that perspective refreshing.  Author is impassioned about the subject of book in a way that makes you put up with the occasional hectoring and shrillness.<br />One fundamental problem I had with the substance, rather then the style of the book:  Author repeatedly discusses various civic improvement schemes as plots to \\"increase real estate values\\". Query: Is that really such a nefarious scheme? If you look at California today, property ownership is hardly the exclusive province of the elite.  In this way, I think the book unwittingly lends supports to an alternative, and contradictory hypotheses: That the actions that economic elites take in their own self interest ultimately benefit those outside their own social class.<br />So, that's something to think about.	2003-08-27

You'll probably have to buy this one, regardless of your feelings about the shortcomings of this one.  As a defense attorney practicing in federal court, I deal with conspriacy all the time.  How nice it is then, to have a little portable book that is compact and durable enough to bring to counsel table at a motions hearing!  I mean really, that's just a useful thing to have.  Author is a former AUSA, not that that is a BAD thing, necessarily.  My bottom line is that you really do need a good treatment of the relationship of the law of conspriacy to the law of evidence.  Maybe I'm just taking a short cut here, but I think it's pretty handy.<br />The rest of the sections are all right. You could probably sum up the law of conspiracy in two words, but I'm fairly sure that Amazon won't print one of them...	2003-08-25

This book documents the &quot;Mormon Blood Atonement&quot; killing that took place in Kirtland, Ohio during the 80's.  Kirtland, of course, is the sight of the original Mormon Temple built by Smith and Sidney Rigdon.<br />I should say that I read Jon Krakauer's &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot;, which deals with the same subject, so I may compare the two during the review.<br />The MOST interesting part of this book is that it takes you inside the Reorganized Latter Day Saints, a &quot;splinter&quot; faction of Mormonism that stayed behind in the Mid West when the Mormons trekked to Utah with Brigham Young.  The RLDS (as it's called) is headquartered in Missouri.  It's prophet was(at the time of this book) a lineal descent of Joe Smith.  The chruch is also notable because it rejected polygamy (one of the main doctrinal reasons it split from the larger church.<br />Jeffrey Lundgren is the &quot;prophet&quot; at the heart of this book.  He is one sick twist.  I'm not going to get into it here, but this book is an NC-17 type of story. Do not read this if you are faint of heart!<br />Early has a news-papery writing style that fits the subject matter.  His sourcing for the tale is outstanding. He managed to interview most, if not all, of the major players.<br />Unlike Krakauer, Early doesn't cut away from the action to full chapters about the history of Mormonism.  His focus is tight on the story.  As a result, you do get a fuller picture of Jeffrey Lundgren, but I believe that Early let the RLDS off the hook.  Lundgren worked as a tour guide for the RLDS in Kirtland for several years as he assembled together his cult.  The back drop to the story is the split in the RLDS between church &quot;liberals&quot;, who voted in the '80's to allow women to be ordained in the church, and fundamentalists (like Jeffrey) who wanted to keep things old school.<br />I believe all of Jeffrey's followers were RLDS members who would describe themselves as &quot;fundamentalist&quot;.<br />I'd have to say this book is just a touch &quot;much&quot; for most people.

Media executives, models, celebrities of all sorts, and all those who worship at their feet.  In fact, to these people, and to the people who want to be like them, cool is  good. Everybody wants their own good.  Most people think of it in terms of  their &quot;happiness&quot;.  So, to the extent that all people want to  have their own good, and to the extent that for celebrities (and others)  the good can be maximized by being cool it is easy to see why being cool is  so important.  Bret Easton Ellis understands how important being cool is  in America.  I don't think he likes it.  His books strip coolness down and  exposes it as the morally bankrupt personal philosophy that it truly is.  Glamorama is his best book yet.  To the extent that an indivdual cares  about being cool, she (or he) owes it to herself to read this book.	1999-01-11

The basic plot revolves around Jammu, an Indian law-woman who is made police chief of St. Louis.  The mystery side of the book is largely pedestrian.  What is interesting is the way the Franzen weaves in the theme of suburban seperation from the inner-city.  This theme is quite prescient given recent thought-media coverage of emergent suburban &quot;pods&quot; (see Atlantic Monthly Aug. 1998 for details).  This book is ultimate vacation reading for post-modern elitist types.	1998-07-30

That being said, this book is also pretty &quot;heavy&quot; in that Franzen is not afraid to abandon the ironic detachment so common in young writers.  But no matter.

Benedict is at his finest when a) describing the lust West Virigina hill country that he seems familiar with. and b)creating violent imagery. On these merits alone, I recommend this book and would compare it to, oh, Elmore Leonard and Brett Easton Ellis.  The plot of the book seems rather tangential to what Benedict is trying to achieve.  The story, such as it is, seems to serve as an exscuse for Benedict to show off his talent and his choice of venue. Benedict, to me, seems similar to Bret Easton Ellis in that he enjoys portraying grotestque situations with a peculiar kind of flatness.  Character's speak with strange inflections (by this I don't mean sterotyped hillbilly drawl) and motivation is not always evident. This book is a fascinating read, particularly for those of us who don't interact, on a regular basis, with crazed Hill Country drug lords.  I'll be interested in his next book.	1998-07-30
