US	50279011	RYGCZ5YJX42S9	097417405X	747171206	The Song of an Emerald Dove	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A Unique Read	Not only does the story itself grab you, but the twist and turns of the plot keep drawing you in. One of the things I found particularly intriguing was how the timeline was handled. The author managed it in such a way that is essential to the story yet doesn't make the reader go back and forth to catch up. I could rant enthusiastically about other features of the book and the way it's written but it would give away too much.  <br /> <br />It certainly spoke to the Witch side of me even though I don't practice the way the characters do. But that didn't put me off in the least. In fact it made it that much more intriguing. However anyone that enjoys a good story that keeps you wondering what's going to happen next will have a good read in this one. Witchy or not. <br /> <br />I'm so happy to see that there is a publisher out there like Harvest Shadows who promotes not only this kind of story but the format too. It's about time that these kinds of books are given a chance to reach readers who are hungry for intelligent, well written stories that are not of the boring, mainstream, cookie cutter genre.	2005-09-29

Easy to follow, this book is a good place to start learning about growing and using herbs. In addition to clear explanations on making tinctures, poultices, teas, baths, etc. there are recipes and suggestions for seasonal celebrations.  The fact that it covers not only medicinal uses but also culinary and gift making makes it a valuable beginners book on the diverse uses of herbs. <br /> <br />As a green witch,  I liked the chance to learn about herbs commonly used in magick from a different perspective.  It gave me ideas on how to use these gifts from the Earth in a way that still represents my beliefs yet allows me to share it them with others in different forms other than incense or potions.	2004-11-16

With comprehensive lists of key words that signify all the diverse meanings of each card, interpretations of the symbolisms and what it all means in readings - this book is worth it (!) just for these things alone.  I've never come across such a complete, clear and non-archaic collection before.  I'm sure that even those who are already familiar with the Tarot will find refreshing new insights into the meanings. <br />  <br />For those learning the Tarot, this book contains lessons that are more like having a knowledgeable teacher guiding you instead of boring drills of memorization.  They follow a logical and easy to follow pattern that makes sense.  <br /> <br />The tables and lists of associations are great tools for beginners and advanced students alike.	2004-11-05

It includes detailed information on what kinds of plants do best in sun or shade, with the focus being on those that a witch would use most (moonlight gardens too).  Tying into this are chapters on flower, tree and grown cover magick.  <br /> <br />The chapters on flower folklore, faery magick and specialty gardens are \\"good to knows\\", especially for green witches.  Those on the Esbats and Sabbats contain something for any witch interested in working with their gardens and what they produce during these times.	2004-11-03

There is additional helpful information such as each herbs own recipe and incredibly valuable tables for increasing / decreasing amounts. The lists of associations are handy for double-checking what feels right to use. I also appreciate the inclusion of scent descriptions which saves a learning the hard way when making incense.	2004-10-28

Besides color pictures of crystals (some in more than one version), this book includes information on color, appearance and where it originates from.  Something which is good to know if you are concerned about the mining practices of certain countries.     Each crystal also has a section on how to use it for healing, including where to place on the body and what aliments it's used to treat. However Pagans and Witches will also find the information on attributes a great resource for developing their own use of crystals in spells and rituals.	2004-10-28

Covering not only a wide variety of herbs but some trees and shrubs as well, this book contains easy to follow instructions for successful growing. Just as important it tells you how to properly harvest so that the plant is not harmed and how to dry so that the essential qualities are not lost.  <br /> <br />It also includes sections on the eastern and western use of herbs in healing, creating your garden, and an unfortunately too small area on making tinctures, lotions, salves and the like.  The only other thing that I would have found helpful is a cross reference on ailments as it takes some time to find the right herb for the problem. But that is only because there is so much good information to sort through.	2004-10-28

Which is good because the focus is on the beautiful rituals which make up a good portion of the content.  Besides those for growing healthy plants and dedicating your garden as sacred space, the author has included very special ones for the Sabbats that really highlight the connection of nature and Wicca. I thought the one for Mabon was particularly good in the way she ties all the elements as well as the God and Goddess into the tending of the garden.<br /><br />Because of the rituals, ideas for laying out gardens in witchy styles and the fairly extensive list of plant correspondences this book goes into my top ten list of most often referred to books.	2004-10-20

This book does make a good addition to a reference library as there is a lot covered.  A plus is plant associations for other pantheons besides Roman and Greek.  However I didn't find it logically laid out and there are long paragraphs that would have better served the reader in grid format. I also found too much mythology and old wives tales mixed in with the really helpful bits.  There are chapters dedicated to these topics so it could have been better organized.  Still, there is enough useful information to make it worthwhile as long as you are willing to spend a little extra time looking for it.	2004-10-20

Not only does she have a good writing style, the author clearly demonstrates her extensive knowledge of Wicca and sacred sexuality.   <br /> <br />This book responsibly includes easy to follow instructions about creating sacred space and circle casting along with explanations of why doing so is important.  So that even someone just looking for a book of love spells (not familiar with Wicca / Witchcraft), are given the opportunity to use the information in a proper form. <br /> <br />The spells, rituals, recipes, associations and tips are helpful to seasoned Witches as well, especially when looking for fresh ideas on magick for relationships.  This book contains a little of everything...but in just the right amounts and with a unique perspective if you're already familiar with these things. <br /> <br />I particularly liked the basic framework the author put together for the Great Rite. The simplicity makes it one of the best I've come across. The section on a magickal evening...sensuous!	2004-10-09

If I was rating this book strictly on the title I would have to give it a poor mark.  More like the authors dissertation on what is wrong with Wicca and how he would fix it, there isn't a lot of content about \\"Wicca for  Couples\\". <br /> <br />It should be re-titled and marketed more appropriately for the content. The author does make a lot of good points and has strong arguments that are unfortunately lost in the mix of this particular book. <br /> <br />However the few rituals included are well thought out and could be a very nice starting point for developing your own.	2004-10-04

First off, no matter the subject matter this book is incredibly well written.  It \\"dares\\" to openly discuss the many nuances of  sex practiced in the incredibly varied Pagan community (yes, Ms. Hunter really does cover Paganism and not just Wicca).  Material that could be considered sensitive in some context is handled candidly yet without being titillating just for the sake of sales.  The author takes a very complete big picture view, not holding back when it came to describing the myopic practice pagans sometimes take against one another no matter what we preach.    The well chosen and diverse selection of contributors are intelligent, well spoken and educating. Not being people that I would normally run into (a loss for me), their comments introduced me to new ways of thinking about my sexuality and my spirituality. And how the two can and should be blended into each other.    As a solitary who doesn't have a lot of contact with other Pagans this book was an enlightening look into the diversity of the larger community and in way that I didn't expect, the spirituality that brings us together.	2004-09-27

Selene Silverwind kept things simple yet powerful.  She covers many aspects of love and relationships, not only the sex. Although she does offer suggestions for that area too - all in tasteful form. Respectful of not only the participants but of the Goddess and God as well. <br /> <br />Even those who don't follow the Wiccan path would find the healing and bonding rituals helpful. Those who are Wiccan will appreciate the rituals as they fit so perfectly into the belief system.	2004-09-01

Explaining how the Goddesses have evolved, this book includes modern translations of invocations used in the past. Using these invocations, the author suggest rituals that make you feel as if you are reaching back through time and are celebrating the glory of the Goddesses with our brother and sisters centuries ago.  <br /> <br />What I especially liked is that she included The Muses and The Maenads. It's refreshing to come across an author who appreciates and understands their power and importance along with the other more well known Goddesses. <br /> <br />At the end of each section there are questions and activities to help you identify and draw closer to that particular Goddess. Although many books include the same, these are the best ones I have come across because you can really understand why the author wants you to work on these areas. In other words, they make sense! <br /> <br />Overall, this book is well written, informative and a should be on the bookshelf of those who follow the Goddess's path.	2004-08-13

While this is a book meant for the advanced, there are quite a few very good points made that should be covered in Wicca 101 books which are sadly left out. <br />  <br /> I really like how the book is laid out with the chapters corresponding to the various elements. A nice touch I have not come across in other books. <br />  <br /> The only reason I did not give this book a 5 is because I thought some of the subject matter verged on &quot;how to&quot;, which detracted from the very good (and wise) advice given and points made about BEING an advanced Witch. <br />  <br /> This author really gained my respect by what she says in the second paragraph of the afterward.

While there is certainly nothing wrong with this, I don't think it's a good starting off point for someone new to the Path who may not realize that what is in this book is not the &quot;way&quot; it is for everyone. <br />  <br /> However I did like the last section on setting up your house although I don't see how it relates to Wicca. Sounded more like Feng Shui.	2004-08-04

It gives an excellent view of the Wicca Path; covering just about everything but doesn't go into so much detail that the book is dragged down. It gives the reader a good starting off point from which to explore other books that are more focused on a particular subject.<br />Well written, and informative, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Wicca	2003-06-28

Of all the books that I have read (a lot) since I got back into riding, this is the one that was most worth the money.  The explanations of horse behavior, the reasons and what the response of the human should be are  written in such a special way that isn't clinical or condescending to the  reader. The beautiful photos are an added bonus to an already worthwhile  book.	2000-07-16

I like the idea of connected riding but I found the exercises that you do at home a little too much. Those suggested for when your on the horse would work better if you can ride more than once a week in a lesson.  I got the  most out of the last couple of chapters and would have understood the whole  principle if those were first instead of at the end.	2000-07-16

Although this is not normally the kind of horse and/or riding book that I read, I'm glad that I made my way through the entire three book series.  Since I've finished them I've put into practice that what I picked up and  have seen a difference in the relationship that I have with my riding  partner.  There's something to be said for age and experience especially  when it comes from someone with \\"horse sense\\".	2000-05-30

I ordered this book only after reading enough other reviews that suggested it. But although I found the writing style a little to \\"old fashioned\\" for me there is some much you can learn from a guy like this that I'm glad I  did.  On to the second book in the series...	2000-05-30

While I was reading this book there were many times that I read and re-read certain lines and even whole chapters just because the words made such perfect sense.  I really enjoyed getting the views and experiences of  so many top riders from all aspects of the equestrian world with the author  putting it all into perspective.  The last chapter about losing your friend  and riding companion was so well written that even though I was reading it  through tears I could feel the compassion and complete understanding of the  author. This book goes on the top shelf of my library and I know I will be  going back to it again!	2000-05-30

Although the writing style and the frequent repetition in the text sometimes distracted from getting the point that was being made, the advice and lessons within the book are well worth digging for.  I found the last  few chapters had the most to offer with the last couple lines of the book  really summing it up.	2000-05-30

The same as the first book in this series, I sometimes got a little impatient with the writing style but then also once again I still got a lot out of it.  On to the last book...	2000-05-30
US	50279011	R3Q8BZ7U3BJC5Y	0851317391	7308610	A Mental Attitude to Dressage	Books	5	4	5	N	N	The best book for the real &quot;insides&quot; of riding dressage.	This is an absolute must read for those serious about dressage at any level. Well written, clear to understand and best of all it makes sense! Not only a &quot;how to change your attitude guide&quot; but the reasoning behind it is explained as well. Follow the good advice in this book and  you're sure to see a difference in your riding and how you communicate with  your hoofed partner.	2000-03-14
