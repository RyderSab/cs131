If you have not yet read \\"Bitten\\", do so! It is a novel that will appeal to fans of any genre and has become one of my favourite novels of all time. Because of this, I knew that \\"Stolen\\" would have a very tough act to follow. Well, I am thrilled to report that Kelley Armstrong has succeeded in creating yet another riveting and unputdownable tale, proving what a talented novelist she truly is and that she is here to stay. \\"Stolen\\" is an enchanting and hugely suspenseful tale that continues the captivating story of werewolf Elena Michaels. It is guaranteed to grab and hold your attention from start to finish, and leave you applauding the amazing Ms. Armstrong! <br /> <br />\\"Stolen\\" begins where \\"Bitten\\" left off. Elena Michaels has finally come to terms with what she is and has found a happy and fulfilling life living with her ultra sexy, intense, and often infuriating lover, soul mate, and fellow werewolf Clayton Danvers. Elena and Clayton (who by the way compose perhaps my favourite couple of all time, and trust me, you'll love them too) live in New York State at Stonehaven, the estate of their pack alpha Jeremy.  <br /> <br />One of Elena's roles in the pack is to police all werewolf information circulating throughout the country, and to deal with anyone who comes too close to discovering the truth of their existence. So when Elena finds an article on the internet with information that is disturbingly close to the truth, and with more for sale, she immediately heads out to investigate. But she is shocked to discover that the two diminutive women who are selling this information posses powers that rival Elena's supergirl strength, powers she doesn't begin to understand. Especially when they explain that they are witches, which Elena knows don't exist. But the fact is that Ruth Winterbourne and her niece Paige really are witches, who save Elena from the nasty hunters on her tail and then introduce Elena and her pack to a clandestine world of half-demons, vampires, sorcerers, and shamans.  <br /> <br />And Armstrong describes this remarkable supernatural world and its inhabitants with incredible originality and verve. She gleefully thumbs her nose at all the conventions associated with vampires and other paranormals, creating a fresh and intriguing new set of rules where almost everything we thought we knew about the supernatural is no longer true. <br /> <br />But then Elena is kidnapped by a sociopathic business magnate and a team of scientists who have amassed an entire collection of supernaturals, determined to harness their powers even if it means killing them. And now Elena is in their hands, helpless and imprisoned deep within the earth. Completely cut off from her pack, Elena must rely on her own wits to see her out of this situation alive. Unsure of who she can trust, it's essential that Elena choose her allies carefully, for one wrong move will mean the difference between life and death. <br /> <br />Armstrong has crafted a truly thrilling story that had me tearing through the pages all night long. The suspense builds as the book progresses until your adrenaline is pumping furiously. The plot is taut and wonderfully innovative and the story flows smoothly from beginning to end. And amidst all the danger, intrigue, and nail-biting suspense is the continuing story of Elena and Clayton's romance. The love these two share is truly beautiful, and their scenes together are always passionate, highly arousing, and really manage to touch my heart.  <br /> <br />Kelley Armstrong has penned a winning tale in \\"Stolen\\" that I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone and everyone, along with its predecessor, \\"Bitten\\". Whether you're a man or woman, romance, mystery, or science fiction fan, it does not matter, this book is just plain great. \\"Stolen\\" is a fabulous novel that is guaranteed to entertain and satisfy. And I believe that the characters of Elena, Clayton, and Jeremy are the real magic of Armstrong's books. They are vivid, complex, flawed, and fascinating, and they have completely captured my heart. I fell in love with these three extraordinary individuals from the first, and they have become unbelievably real to me. So do yourself a huge favor and buy Kelley Armstrong's \\"Stolen\\" today!	2005-06-10

Kelley Armstrong's debut novel, \\"Bitten\\", is an unbelievably good book that captivated me from start to finish. I utterly adored this book and could scarcely make myself put it down from the minute I started it (which caused me to lose an entire night's sleep, but WOW was it ever worth it). \\"Bitten\\" is one of those books that you read at lightning pace, then flip right back to page one when you reach the end because you can't bear to part with the characters yet. It's that great. In my humble opinion, \\"Bitten\\" is one of the best werewolf books out there today. Filled with romance, horror, mystery, and some of the most compelling characters I've come across in a long time, \\"Bitten\\" will enthrall, delight, and electrify readers everywhere! <br /> <br />Elena Michaels has spent the last year living a relatively normal and quiet life in Toronto. She has a steady job as a journalist, a nice apartment, and a caring boyfriend. But Elena is no ordinary woman; she is, in fact, the only female werewolf in existence. Bitten by her werewolf fianc and defeating the odds by surviving, Elena has never gotten over his betrayal. After nearly ten years with her pack in New York State, Elena decided to leave them and try to make the stable, happy life she has always dreamed of. And things have been going just fine for the last year, until her pack leader, Jeremy, leaves her an urgent message, summoning her home to deal with a pack emergency. Determined not to be pulled back into her old life, Elena heads off to New York, resolute that she will find out what the problem is and then go back to Toronto. But upon arriving at Jeremy's estate, Stonehaven, Elena feels the unmistakable joy of coming home. <br /> <br />But there are many things to deal with at Stonehaven. Perhaps the most difficult for Elena is dealing with her ex-fianc and lover, Clayton. Clay is still and always will be deeply in love with Elena, though he is an incredibly complicated man. Bitten as a very small child, Clay somehow survived the Change and lived alone as an animal for years before Jeremy found him and took him in. Though he is brilliant, Clay is ruled by his animal instincts, making him a passionate, but often volatile man. But Elena cannot deny the pull she feels towards Clay, and the passion and love they share is both incredibly erotic and achingly beautiful. I absolutely fell in love with Clay and Elena as a couple, and was rooting for them the whole way through. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for Elena, dealing with her confused and powerful feelings for Clay is the least of her worries. A group of non-pack werewolves, known as mutts, have invaded the pack's home, killing humans and leaving them in Jeremy's forest. The mutts are bent on exposing and destroying the pack, and they are coming dangerously close to succeeding. The entire pack is called to Stonehaven to help, though they are only seven strong, including the steadfast Antonio and his fun-loving playboy son, Nick, the considerate Peter, and Elena's good friend Logan. Werewolf genes are passed down only through the males of the species, and women who are bitten virtually never survive the Change. As the only female werewolf, Elena is a very sought after woman, and the entire pack knows that the mutts will try to take her for their own if they get the chance. <br /> <br />Unable to leave her pack when they need her, Elena works with Jeremy and the others to try and figure out what the mutts are really up to and how to stop them. But the mutts are strong and ruthless and they take a deadly toll on the pack. Armstrong weaves a hugely suspenseful tale, and readers will become engrossed in the pack's fight to destroy the mutts before the mutts destroy them. The pack's fight for their territory and their lives is absolutely gripping, and is mixed seamlessly with the evolving relationship between Elena and Clayton. The tale builds towards an exhilarating climax that is sure to have readers on the edge of their seats, and Armstrong provides a wonderfully satisfying conclusion. <br /> <br />\\"Bitten\\" is a downright superb novel, a sparkling and inspired tale of love and suspense that will make every reader an instant Kelley Armstrong fan. It's delicious and sinful, and is best described as a compulsive page-turner! Armstrong provides readers with a fascinating and perceptive view of wolf society, and when the characters are in wolf form, their actions ring true. Each character is vivid, real, and brilliantly portrayed, from the controlled and compassionate pack alpha, Jeremy, to the fabulously strong, stubborn, and loyal heroine Elena. The suspense quite literally had my heart pounding and the adrenaline pumping through me, and the story came vibrantly to life inside my head. \\"Bitten\\" is an original and outstanding novel, and it's hard to believe it's Armstrong's first one. Kelley Armstrong has breathed new life into the werewolf genre and I just can't praise this book enough. So read \\"Bitten\\" for yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about. Trust me, you'll love it!	2005-06-10

I have been a big fan of Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse series since the first book, \\"Dead Until Dark,\\" and the series shows no signs of slowing down now in the fifth outing.  \\"Dead as a Doornail\\" finds Harris, and Sookie, in fine form for another fun, fast-paced, highly entertaining adventure.      Sookie Stackhouse, small town girl, barmaid, and telepath is a wonderful heroine.  Plucky and vibrant, as well as smart and extremely likeable, Sookie is easy to relate to.  She never purports to be a hero, she is simply an average woman with a useful \\"disability\\" who often finds herself in the midst of extraordinary creatures and events.    In \\"Dead as a Doornail\\" Sookie has a lot on her plate.  A sniper is targeting shifters in the area, including her boss Sam who is shot and badly injured right before her eyes.  Sookie's house is set on fire by an apparent anti-vampire fanatic, and to top it all off, the Were's packmaster is killed in an accident and Sookie finds herself caught up in the politics of choosing the successor.    Through it all, Sookie is joined by a delightful cast of supernatural characters who Harris brings convincingly from legend into reality.  My personal favourite remains Bill the vampire, and though I was at first dismayed by Harris's breakup of Bill and Sookie in book three, \\"Club Dead,\\" it's clear that it was a necessary development in order for Sookie to grow as a character and find her personal strength.  Truth be told though, I still have a very strong hope that Bill and Sookie will reunite in a later instalment of the series.  In the meantime, I find Eric, Bill's vampire boss, to be great fun, and I enjoy Sookie's were and shifter suitors as well.    All-in-all, \\"Dead as a Doornail\\" is a great read.  I finished the book in a matter of a day or two; I was utterly captivated, as always, by Harris's vivid alternate reality.  The plot was hugely entertaining despite the fact that the final villain was relatively easy to peg.  \\"Dead as a Doornail\\" receives my highest endorsement and is an ideal summer (or winter!) read.  The future of this dynamic series, and Harris's career, is bright indeed, and she will have a fan in me as long as she turns out books like this one!	2005-06-05

As a relatively new fan of Nora Roberts, I have made it a mission of mine to acquire all of her classic novels, the ones written before I discovered this amazing author about five years ago.  I have enjoyed every story I have managed to get my hands on, but the two tales in \\"Born O'Hurley\\" really stand out for me.  The O'Hurley family consists of two entertainer parents who live their life on the road, an older brother, and fraternal triplets Chantel, Abby, and Maddy.  Nora has created a wonderfully complex, vital, and compelling family in the O'Hurleys, and they had me hooked from the very first page! <br /> <br />The first of the O'Hurley triplets to have her story told is Abby, the quiet but strong middle (by just a few minutes) sister.  After a difficult and unhappy first marriage to well-known racecar driver Charles Rockwell, Abby has been left a widow struggling to raise her two sons on a small farm in Virginia. <br />But the steady routine of her life is irrevocably changed when author Dylan Crosby comes into her life to write the biography of her deceased husband. <br />Dylan soon finds he is far more interested in the lovely Abby than in the job he came to do, and he becomes determined to discover who she truly is.  Because if Abby really is the honest, kind, and determined woman she seems to be, she is everything Dylan has ever dreamed of but never hoped to find. <br />Roberts has written a wonderful tale here, filled with powerful emotions, captivating romance, and engaging characters.  \\"The Last Honest Woman\\" is truly a Nora Roberts gem. <br /> <br />The second half of \\"Born O'Hurley\\" delves into the life of the youngest triplet, Maddy O'Hurley.  Maddy is an incredibly vibrant and open young woman, and she is a character you can't help but love.  After leaving her role as the lead of a Broadway hit, Maddy has taken on a new and challenging role in another musical. <br />And when Maddy meets the financial backer of the production, Reed Valentine of Valentine Records, she finds herself drawn to him.  Reed and Maddy are polar opposites in almost every way.  He's conservative and completely focused on business, she's full of life and colour and wears her emotions on the surface for the world to see. <br />And though Reed finds himself irresistibly attracted to Maddy, he has a troubled past and issues with trust that stem from his childhood. So while Maddy has fallen head over heels in love with Reed, she realizes that he may never be able to overcome his past and give her what she needs, his heart. <br />Both the effervescent Maddy and the reserved Reed will pull at your heart and you will feel for each of them as they struggle to find a way to each other.  Infused with sizzling romance, energetic dance sequences, and the family unity and dynamics that Nora is such a master of \\"Dance to the Piper\\" is a triumph. <br /> <br />\\"Born O'Hurley\\" comes with my top recommendation so if you've never read the stories of Abby and Maddy, buy this delightful omnibus today.  I've also had the chance to read the other two O'Hurley novels; Chantel's tale in \\"Skin Deep\\" and the prodigal brother Trace's story in \\"Without a Trace\\" and they are equally wonderful.  Look for them to be re-printed in \\"O'Hurley's Return\\" in February 2005.   <br />I promise that you will love this incredible family as much as I do, so don't miss out on getting to know them! <br />	2004-08-15

It's a moving and highly satisfying story and I for one am very grateful to Silhouette for giving me the chance to enjoy it!<br />&quot;Temptation&quot; introduces Eden Carlbough, who has been forced to make a new start in life after her father's sudden death.  Faced with a mountain of unexpected debts, Eden has sold off her family home and possessions, and moved from her plush house in Philadelphia to a cabin in a summer girl's camp.  Partnered with her best friend Candy, Eden has started Camp Liberty, and is determined to make it work.  Terrified but resolute, Eden sets out down a path of self-discovery.<br />And one of Eden's discoveries is her camp's handsome neighbour, orchard owner Chase Elliot.  After falling from one of Chase's apple trees and into his arms, Eden finds herself flooded with new and powerful feelings.  But a recent failed engagement has destroyed Eden's faith in men, so she hides and fights the love that blooms in her heart for Chase.  <br />But Eden has found her way into Chase's heart as well, and he isn't about to let her slip away from him so easily.  He can see that Eden must prove to herself that she can make it in the world on her own, but he's determined to make this vibrant and courageous beauty his own.  However it won't be easy for Eden and Chase to get their happily ever after.   Eden's mistrust of men and her fear of depending on anyone for support may just keep these two apart, and stop them from finding paradise in each other's arms!<br />Nora Roberts' greatest strength lies in her characters; she creates people that we can identify with and care for, whose triumphs and failures become our own, and though her early works lack a bit of the maturity of her later works, this gift shines through regardless.  Roberts expertly renders Eden's plight, and her resilience and tenacity make her a character one can't helpbut love.  Together, Eden and Chase make a perfect pair, and their romance is sure to bring a smile to readers' faces.  &quot;Temptation&quot; is a heart-warming tale of love and understanding, a quick and pleasing read, and it comes well recommended.	2003-10-11

Robb, is an utterly delightful novel, melding present day romantic suspense with futuristic police procedural into one spectacular whole!  &quot;Remember When&quot; is sure to thrill this author's multitudes of dedicated fans, and will, without a doubt, win over legions of new readers as well.  With its hip dialogue, exhilarating mystery, and steamy romance this novel undoubtedly lives up to the extremely high standards we have come to expect from both Nora Roberts and J.D. Robb.<br />The first half of &quot;Remember When&quot; is set in the present day (2003) and sets the stage for a mystery that will take more than half a century to solve.  Laine Tavish is the owner of a small and modestly successful antique store in Angel's Gap, Maryland, where she has built a quiet and comfortable life for herself.  But Laine isn't just a shopkeeper in small town, USA, she's also the daughter of con man &quot;Big Jack&quot; O'Hara, and spent the first half of life following in her father's footsteps.  Laine believes she has left that side of her life behind long ago, but it all catches up with her when her father's best friend dies right outside her shop, dragging Laine into a multi-million dollar diamond heist.  <BR>Private Investigator Max Gannon is on the trail of these missing diamonds, and his path leads him right to Laine Tavish.  Though determined to find the diamonds, Max soon discovers that he needs Laine a whole lot more, and the two begin a whirlwind romance as they both tumble headlong into love.  Laine and Max's relationship is exciting and enticing, and though it all happens extremely fast, Roberts' deft hand makes it all seem believable.<BR>But the trail that led Max to Laine has led a ruthless murderer to her as well.  A madman who will do anything to recover the diamonds he thinks Laine can lead him to!  <br />The second half of &quot;Remember When&quot; jumps forward to NewYork in the year 2059, and a good portion of the diamonds have still never been found.  Max and Laine's granddaughter, Samantha, has just published a book about the diamond heist, and returns home from her book tour to find her home ransacked and her housesitter dead.  Which is how the case comes to the attention of Lieutenant Eve Dallas, who is now bound and determined to solve the case, catch the new culprit, and recover the missing diamonds.  <BR>The cast of characters we have come to know and love in J.D. Robb's  &quot;In Death&quot; series are back in this installment and better than ever, including Eve's charming, ultra-rich, and always helpful husband, Roarke and the Lieutenant's faithful sidekick, Peabody.  And though the guilty party is essentially revealed to us halfway through, the story itself keeps the reader completely enthralled and tearing through the pages.<BR>So with the help of her husband and co-workers, it is up to Eve Dallas to solve this mystery once and for all, and close a circle that has brought about violence, deceit, and murder for more than fifty years!<br />The very idea of this book was a stroke of genius in itself, and Roberts has smoothly brought that idea through to fruition.  &quot;Remember When&quot; is a hugely entertaining tale, filled with sympathetic and admirable characters who readers can really root for.  I cannot recommend this book enough, so don't hesitate over the hardcover price, buy it today!  Nora Roberts and J.D.

US	43021965	R168DYSNEN08C6	0373983255	922817467	Nora Roberts Special Collector's Mixed Prepack: Blithe Images, Untamed, and From This Day	Books	4	63	63	N	N	Three Charming Nora Roberts Classics!	As an avid fan of Nora Roberts, I am always thrilled when Silhouette reprints her older tales, and these three were a delight to read.  It's fascinating to get a look at Nora's writing from early in her career and to see how much she has grown and evolved.  Each of these books is short, sweet, and enjoyable, and any romance or Nora Roberts fan will likely agree.<br />&quot;Blithe Images&quot; is the oldest of the three and it lacks the maturity and flow of Nora's later work.  It tells the story of Hillary Baxter a small town girl who has made it big as a fashion model in New York.  And when the owner of the prestigious Mode magazine, Bret Bardoff, hires her to do an extensive layout, she tumbles headlong into love with him.  But Hillary lacks the confidence of the sophisticated women in Bret's life, and feels that she will never be able to compete with them.  She is oblivious to how alluring her innocence and enthusiasm truly are, although Bret most certainly is not.  Will Hillary and Bret find a way to tell each other how they truly feel?  Or will Hillary's doubts and Bret's interfering &quot;friend&quot; Charlene keep them from finding a lifetime of love in each other's arms?<BR>This is a quick and fun little story that I really enjoyed, though the writing did tend to jump around in a bit of a disconcerting fashion.  Despite this, I still had a great time reading &quot;Blithe Images&quot;<br />&quot;From this Day&quot; introduces BJ Clark, the manager of a cozy little Vermont Inn, and though it is only a year older than &quot;Blithe Images&quot; it shows a considerable improvement in Nora's style.  BJ's Inn has recently changed ownership, and she is sure that Taylor Reynolds plans to destroy her perfect little haven and turn it into another of his fancy resorts.  So when BJ meets Taylor, she is prepared to do battle.  But what she isn't prepared for is the powerful attraction she feels towards him.  Taylor and BJ are a wonderful pair and Nora tells the tale of their romance in a delightful fashion.  BJ knows she has lost her heart to Taylor, but will he return her love and fulfill her every dream?  Or will BJ lose both her inn and her one chance at happiness?<BR>&quot;From this Day&quot; is a sweet and amusing tale that kept me captivated from start to finish.  It's a lovely little gem that any Nora Roberts fan will not want to miss.<br />&quot;Untamed&quot; is the final book in this 3 pack and definitely my favourite.  Jovilette Wilder is the Queen of the Jungle Cats in Prescott's Circus Colossus, and when the beloved owner of the circus dies, he leaves it to his estranged son.  So when Keane Prescott, a successful Chicago attorney, arrives to inspect his new acquisition, Jovilette goes at him with her claws bared.  And though Jo resents Keane, she can't deny the passion he awakens inside her or the pull he has on her heart.  And despite her bravery in the ring with her lions, Jo is terrified of revealing the love she holds for Keane in her heart.  Not wanting to be hurt and not knowing what Keane's plans are for the circus, Jo keeps her feelings to herself.  And when Keane starts to distance himself from her, it looks like Jo is destined to live her life without the man she loves!<BR>Nora has done a fabulous job in &quot;Untamed&quot; of creating a brilliantly vivid picture of this traveling circus and everyone in it.  The romance between Keane and Jovilette is utterly enchanting and readers will undoubtedly find &quot;Untamed&quot; well worth the read!<br />Each of the books in this 3 pack is filled with the magic of Nora Roberts' writing, and early in her career or not, anything by Nora is sure to entertain and satisfy.  &quot;Blithe Images&quot;, &quot;From this Day&quot;, and &quot;Untamed&quot; deliver exactly what they should, a light-hearted and fun-filled romantic journey that is sure to be enjoyed by all!	2003-06-15

Well, what is there to say about the incomparable Nora Roberts, writing here as J.D. Robb, except for WOW!  This woman continues to amaze me, creating one utterly enchanting novel after another, so I think, \\"surely she can't top this one\\".  After reading and loving every book in the \\"In Death\\" series, I picked up \\"Portrait in Death\\" with very high expectations, and fell in love with Eve, Roarke and everyone else all over again!  What a fantastic novel!  \\"Portrait in Death\\" contains a thrilling and compelling mystery along with some of the most absorbing and well-written character development that we have seen to date in this series.  And, of course, it's really our fascination with the characters that keeps us coming back to this series over and over again, and does \\"Portrait in Death\\" ever deliver!<br />The story takes place during the sweltering hot summer of 2059, and Robb skillfully creates a sense of time and place so that readers feel as if they themselves are there, more than 55 years in the future.  And when a bright young college student is murdered and thrown in a recycler like so much trash, the tenacious Lieutenant Eve Dallas is, once again, determined to stand for the dead and find the killer.  But perhaps most disturbing about this particular case, is that prior to the discovery of the body, a package of photos of the murdered girl were sent to Eve's friend, Nadine Furst, a well-known TV reporter.  It's clear that the killer photographed the victim for some time before her death, without her knowledge, and it's also clear that in the final, perfect picture, the girl is already dead.  <br />The killer wants Nadine's help in showing his glorious work and the miraculous final outcome of that work to the world, but the killer will have to deal with Lieutenant Dallas if that work is to be finished.  Fueled by the surety that her killer won't wait long to strike again, Eve launches into another fascinating investigation, ably assisted by her faithful aide Peabody and her usual team including EDD's Captain Feeny and Detective McNab.  All of these recurring secondary characters continue to amuse and intrigue me with their ever-evolving relationship dynamics, though in \\"Portrait in Death\\" the spotlight falls undeniably on Eve and her super-sexy, ultra-rich husband Roarke.<br />As is clear from my description of him, Roarke is every woman's fantasy man, a role that has always made him seem a bit larger than life and a bit too perfect to be human.  But in \\"Portrait in Death\\", we discover a whole new, much more human side of Roarke, which was absolutely wonderful to explore.  Indeed, the most compelling thread in this expertly woven tale begins when Roarke discovers a shocking and long-kept secret about his parentage, which knocks his feet right out from under him.  Confused, guilty, and in great emotional turmoil, Roarke deals with the whole situation unbelievably badly.  So Eve finds herself in unfamiliar territory.  In previous books, it has always been Roarke taking care of Eve, but now it is up to Eve to make things better for Roarke and help him get his feet back on solid ground.  And I was completely captivated watching Eve, for perhaps the first time ever, put her work aside for the sake of her husband.  Eve really comes through as a wife in \\"Portrait in Death\\" and it was a beautiful thing to see.  We all know that Eve is a fantastic Lieutenant, and it's always a pleasure to watch her work her way through a case and see justice served, but in this book, we discover that Eve is also a fantastic wife.  Eve's sensitivity and tact in dealing with Roarke's situation amazed me, and this insightful and touching storyline made \\"Portrait in Death\\" an enormously rewarding read. <br />Robb seamlessly mixes the emotional tale of Roarke's newly discovered background with Eve's suspenseful pursuit of a killer to create one magnificent novel.  I loved every moment of \\"Portrait in Death\\" and I just can't praise it enough.  \\"Portraitin Death\\" gets my whole-hearted recommendation, though I hasten to add that readers will get far more out of this novel if they have already read the rest of the series.  And it's not that newcomers won't be able to follow the story, it's just that the events of previous books make Eve's development as a person and Roarke's newfound humanity incredibly gratifying to those who've been with them from the start, an element that just won't be appreciated by first time readers.  Nonetheless, \\"Portrait in Death\\" is a superb novel, sure to be enjoyed by each and every reader.  So don't hesitate, buy this captivating book today!	2003-04-17

A Quick and Enjoyable Read!	\\"Full Tilt\\" looks to be the start of a fun, fast-paced, and exciting new series, co-authored by the fabulous Janet Evanovich and her friend Charlotte Hughes.  It is a very quick read, but one that I really did enjoy.  As a follow up to \\"Full House\\", released last year (2002), it works well, and the key to enjoying both of these novels is to take them and like them for what they are; light-hearted, highly entertaining tales that aren't supposed to be deep or thought-provoking, just good, clean fun.  \\"Full Tilt\\" is heavier on the mystery and somewhat lighter on the romance than its predecessor and I would definitely recommend giving it a try, even to those who were a bit disappointed with \\"Full House\\".<br />\\"Full Tilt\\" begins the story of Maximillian Holt, who we met in \\"Full House\\" as an unmanageable yet brilliant sixteen-year-old.  In \\"Full Tilt\\" Max is all grown up, and his genius has led him to great heights.  A sexy and mysterious millionaire, Max drives around in a car he created himself, with a hugely amusing and downright opinionated AI computer named Muffin who is equipped with every technological luxury imaginable.  The story begins when Max buys into Jamie Swift's struggling small town newspaper, and comes roaring into her nice, orderly life.  Engaged to a wealthy and handsome man, Jamie thinks she has her life all mapped out, until Max arrives and turns things inside out.  There is an undeniable attraction between Max and Jamie, and Jamie just doesn't know what to do about it.  Especially when Jamie discovers that beneath Max's highly inflated ego is a kind, considerate and caring man who keeps doing nice things for her.<br />But Max has made the trip to the town of Beaumont, South Carolina for more than one reason.  Beaumont is now the home of his flaky, but compassionate older sister Deedee and her long-time husband Frankie Fontana.  An ex-wrestler, Frankie is now running for mayor, and has received some unsettling threats.  And when Frankie promises tolook into the town's missing tax dollars, he stirs up some serious trouble. Amidst bombs, bullets, two assassins, and an ex-military nutcase things couldn't get much more dangerous!  <br />And Max is determined to keep Jamie safe, which means keeping her close.  But their proximity to one another means that the feelings Max and Jamie have for one another become harder and harder to deny.  Add in Deedee, who is in serious denial about what's causing her hot flashes (because it certainly isn't menopause), Deedee's flamboyant personal assistant, and several of Frankie's old wrestling buddies, and you have the recipe for a highly amusing, wacky, and off-the-wall mystery romance that will keep you smiling from start to finish.<br />\\"Full Tilt\\" is a madcap adventure filled with suspense and romance, and a great cast of characters.  Max and Jamie are both interesting and compelling people who readers will enjoy getting to know, and I am already looking forward to their next escapade in...\\"Full Speed\\".  \\"Full Tilt\\" isn't quite up to par with the Stephanie Plum series, but then, what is?  \\"Full Tilt\\" is however, an engaging, humorous, and thrilling tale that will give readers several hours of pure pleasure.  And so I recommend \\"Full Tilt\\" whole-heartedly to everyone who can enjoy a light, tremendously entertaining, and undemanding book for what it is.	2003-02-11

If you have not yet read \\"Bitten\\", do so!  It is a novel that will appeal to fans of any genre and has become one of my favourite novels of all time.  Because of this, I knew that \\"Stolen\\" would have a very tough act to follow.  Well, I am thrilled to report that Kelley Armstrong has succeeded in creating yet another riveting and unputdownable tale, proving what a talented novelist she truly is and that she is here to stay.  \\"Stolen\\" is an enchanting and hugely suspenseful tale that continues the captivating story of werewolf Elena Michaels.  It is guaranteed to grab and hold your attention from start to finish, and leave you applauding the amazing Ms. Armstrong!<br />\\"Stolen\\" begins where \\"Bitten\\" left off.  Elena Michaels has finally come to terms with what she is and has found a happy and fulfilling life living with her ultra sexy, intense, and often infuriating lover, soul mate, and fellow werewolf Clayton Danvers.  Elena and Clayton (who by the way compose perhaps my favourite couple of all time, and trust me, you'll love them too) live in New York State at Stonehaven, the estate of their pack alpha Jeremy.  <br />One of Elena's roles in the pack is to police all werewolf information circulating throughout the country, and to deal with anyone who comes too close to discovering the truth of their existence.  So when Elena finds an article on the internet with information that is disturbingly close to the truth, and with more for sale, she immediately heads out to investigate.  But she is shocked to discover that the two diminutive women who are selling this information posses powers that rival Elena's supergirl strength, powers she doesn't begin to understand.  Especially when they explain that they are witches, which Elena knows don't exist.  But the fact is that Ruth Winterbourne and her niece Paige really are witches, who save Elena from the nasty hunters on her tail and then introduce Elena and her pack to a clandestine world of half-demons, vampires, sorcerers, and shamans.  <br />And Armstrong describes this remarkable supernatural world and its inhabitants with incredible originality and verve.  She gleefully thumbs her nose at all the conventions associated with vampires and other paranormals, creating a fresh and intriguing new set of rules where almost everything we thought we knew about the supernatural is no longer true.<br />But then Elena is kidnapped by a sociopathic business magnate and a team of scientists who have amassed an entire collection of supernaturals, determined to harness their powers even if it means killing them.  And now Elena is in their hands, helpless and imprisoned deep within the earth.  Completely cut off from her pack, Elena must rely on her own wits to see her out of this situation alive.  Unsure of who she can trust, it's essential that Elena choose her allies carefully, for one wrong move will mean the difference between life and death.<br />Armstrong has crafted a truly thrilling story that had me tearing through the pages all night long.  The suspense builds as the book progresses until your adrenaline is pumping furiously.  The plot is taut and wonderfully innovative and the story flows smoothly from beginning to end.  And amidst all the danger, intrigue, and nail-biting suspense is the continuing story of Elena and Clayton's romance.  The love these two share is truly beautiful, and their scenes together are always passionate, highly arousing, and really manage to touch my heart.  <br />Kelley Armstrong has penned a winning tale in \\"Stolen\\" that I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone and everyone, along with its predecessor, \\"Bitten\\".  Whether you're a man or woman, romance, mystery, or science fiction fan, it does not matter, this book is just plain great.  \\"Stolen\\" is a fabulous novel that is guaranteed to entertain and satisfy.  AndI believe that the characters of Elena, Clayton, and Jeremy are the real magic of Armstrong's books.  They are vivid, complex, flawed, and fascinating, and they have completely captured my heart.  I fell in love with these three extraordinary individuals from the first, and they have become unbelievably real to me.  So do yourself a huge favor and buy Kelley Armstrong's \\"Stolen\\" today!	2003-01-19

But upon her arrival, she finds herself utterly captivated by a portrait of a Highland warrior named Duncan MacGregor, painted in 1745.  A previous owner of Glengarren, Rachel feels inexplicably drawn to this long dead man, and begins to worry about her sanity.

Both tales are fun, fresh, and beautifully romantic and I was completely enthralled by them.  Roberts has created four fascinating and sympathetic main characters and placed them in two totally engrossing and irresistible stories.  What a pleasure it was to read this book!  &quot;Truly, Madly Manhattan&quot; is 500 pages of pure enjoyment, so don't wait another minute to buy it!<br />The first of the two tales, &quot;Local Hero&quot;, introduces Hester Wallace, a single mother who has just moved to a new apartment to be closer to her new job as a bank loan officer.  Her 10-year-old son Radley is the one and only priority in her life, and she has long since determined that she needs and wants nobody but herself to depend on.  But Hester's narrow view of her future is suddenly turned on end when she meets her handsome new neighbour, Mitch Dempsey.  Mitch is a successful comic book writer, a profession Hester has trouble taking seriously, but he's also the creator of Radley's hero, Commander Zark.  Mitch immediately forms a strong bond with Radley and is intrigued by the coolly polite Hester and her great legs.  And Mitch soon discovers what an incredible and warm woman Hester really is, and he falls madly in love.  Hester is undeniably drawn to Mitch, whose thoughtfulness and tenderness weaken her hard won defenses.  In addition, Mitch's obvious love for her son touches her heart and makes her wish for things she has vowed to live without.  But Mitch isn't about to give up on the woman he wants to love and cherish forever, though it won't be easy to convince her to let him into her life.  Hester has sworn never again to trust or depend on a man since her ex-husband's careless and crushing abandonment 6 years before, and she's petrified of having her life shattered by a man again.  Will Mitch be able to prove that he's committed to Hester and Radley for life?  Or will Hester's painful past keep her from finding a future filled with love?<br />The second, equally fantastic tale is &quot;Dual Image&quot;, in which we meet Ariel Kirkwood, an outgoing, compassionate, free-spirited woman and a talented actress.  When Ariel gets chosen to play the leading role in screenwriter Booth DeWitt's newest movie, she gets much more than she bargained for as she finds herself falling hard for the mysterious and reluctantly caring Booth.  But Booth has modeled Ariel's movie character on his cruel, cold, and duplicitous ex-wife, who has instilled in him an innate mistrust of actresses.  And the better Ariel plays the part, though the calculating character is the antithesis of Ariel's generous, loving, and guileless true self, the harder it becomes to convince Booth to trust in her.  In love with Ariel but terrified of being played and used again, Booth tries to distance himself from her.  Ariel makes Booth feel things that he's convinced himself he has no desire for, and more, she gives him hope that honest and unconditional love really does exist. But these powerful emotions make Booth very nervous, and he still doesn't quite believe that his trust won't be rewarded with betrayal.  And though there is a lifetime of happiness waiting for Booth in Ariel's arms, he may just turn away from his one and only chance at love everlasting.<br />&quot;Local Hero&quot; and &quot;Dual Image&quot; are both fabulous stories, and the romances between Hester &amp; Mitch and Ariel &amp; Booth are touching, passionate, and perfectly written.  The characters in both stories are real, lovable and just plain wonderful and I adored them.  Nora Roberts, in my humble opinion, is nothing short of a genius and she has a true gift for creating characters and stories that come vividly to life in her readers' minds and hearts.  &quot;Truly, Madly Manhattan&quot; is sure to exceed your expectations and make you sigh with pleasure.  Both tales are totally satisfying, equally excellent, and utterly entertaining and this is a book you most definitely do not want to miss!	2003-01-12

I became utterly absorbed in the story right from the start, and Feehan's passionate storytelling kept me turning pages well into the night.  The main characters are intriguing and well matched, and Feehan's take on the classic Beauty and the Beast tale becomes something original and wickedly enticing under her talented hand.  \\"Lair of the Lion\\" is an all-around solid effort that is sure to be enjoyed by a wide range of romance readers.<br />Isabella Vernaducci is a courageous young aristocrat who has had everything that once belonged to her family stolen away by the ruthless and power-hungry Don Rivellio.  On top of that, the pitiless Don has imprisoned her brother Lucca and sentenced him to death.  Desperate to save her brother, Isabella makes the treacherous journey to the home of the powerful and mysterious Don Nicolai DeMarco in the Italian Alps.  Don DeMarco is the only man who can save Lucca's life, but no outsider has ever survived the journey to his palazzo.  Supposedly the victim of a terrible curse, Don DeMarco is rumoured to have the ability to control the heavens and to make the beasts on earth do his bidding.<br />But when Isabella arrives at the palazzo of Don DeMarco, she meets a man unlike any other she has ever met.  His intense tawny eyes, flowing mane of hair, and devilishly handsome face make her heart pound double time.  Though his commanding presence fills Isabella with fear, she is undeniably drawn to Don Nicolai.  And she does not see the monstrous and heartless beast of legend when she looks at Nicolai, but a dedicated and compassionate man who has worked tirelessly for his people. <br />Don Nicolai DeMarco promises to save Isabella's brother on one condition, that she becomes his wife.  Though the palazzo is a less than hospitable place, with huge lions roaming all around and permeated by a dark and malevolent presence, Isabella is captivated by Nicolai.  But she soon finds out that the DeMarco curse is no legend, but a grim reality.  Though she can see Nicolai as a handsome man, all others see him as a beast, a beast that is destined to destroy the woman he loves.  But Isabella won't give up so easily on the man she has fallen in love with, and resolves to find a way to break the curse.  Nicolai and Isabella's romance is portrayed in typical Feehan fashion, it's incredibly erotic, passionate and beautifully tender (and you may need to open a window to cool off while reading the love scenes).<br />Unfortunately, danger awaits Isabella at every turn and she's going to need every ounce of courage she possesses to save both herself and the man she loves.  Unexplainable \\"accidents\\" occur almost daily, and they're all directed at Isabella.  Feehan builds the suspense very effectively, and Isabella and Nicolai must stand together against the evil that seeks to destroy them, and hope that their love will be strong enough to triumph.  Will Isabella find a way to defeat the curse and banish the evil that haunts the valley?  Or will she end up sacrificing her life and Nicolai's soul?<br />\\"Lair of the Lion\\" is a wonderful historical romance filled with passion, thrills, chills, and intrigue.  The atmosphere is unabashedly dark, brooding, and, well, gothic, so if you are not a fan of gothic fiction this isn't going to be your cup of tea.  Personally, I thought it was great and I thoroughly enjoyed the gothic flavour of it all.  Feehan has created a fascinating cast of rich and vivid characters, from the irresistible and charismatic hero, Nicolai, to his misunderstood and charming sister, Fransesca.  The palazzo itself is a fabulous labyrinth of hidden passageways and shadowy corridors, providing the perfect setting for this riveting tale.  \\"Lair of the Lion\\" is a tantalizing and suspenseful tale of first-rate gothic romance, and I recommend it whole-heartedly.	2003-01-04

Though \\"Blood Debt\\" is my least favourite of the five books, due largely to the drastic change in the relationship between Henry and Vicki, I still loved it, and will greatly miss Vicki, Henry, and Mike now that the series has come to an end.  Filled with vivid and fascinating characters, a top-notch mystery, romance, and tons of danger and suspense, \\"Blood Debt\\" will appeal to a wide range of readers.<br />The book revolves around three main characters, Vicki Nelson, a Private Investigator and ex-cop, her lover, homicide detective Mike Celluci, and her ex-lover Henry Fitzroy, 450-year-old vampire, romance writer, and bastard son of Henry VIII.  Henry has been living in Vancouver for a year now, while Vicki and Mike have remained in Toronto.  Vicki and Henry have not seen each other at all during that year, but when a handless ghost begins haunting Henry, demanding vengeance against those who murdered him, Henry knows he needs Vicki's help to solve the mystery.  Especially when the ghost begins playing a deadly game.  Each night when Henry awakes he may ask the ghost one question.  If the answers is yes, the ghost will leave, but if the answer is no, an innocent victim will die.  At his wits' end, Henry breaks the rule he has lived by for nearly five centuries and asks Vicki to come to Vancouver.<br />When Vicki arrives with Mike, she and Henry have a hard time just being in the same room together, but as time passes, a strange thing happens.  The more time they spend together, the easier it becomes for Henry and Vicki to get along, though their relationship is rather violent.  So Vicki, Henry, and Mike work together to discover who killed Henry's ghost and why, and end up right in the middle of a perilous and volatile situation.  Huff provides her readers with an intriguing and exciting mystery to solve, set amidst the ever-changing and always interesting love triangle ofVicki, Henry, and Mike.  <br />I can't reveal too much of this book because it would ruin the ending of the fourth in this series, \\"Blood Pact\\", for those who have not yet read it.  \\"Blood Debt\\" is a wonderful read that mixes horror, mystery, and fantasy seamlessly, while exploring the fascinating new dynamics of the relationship between Vicki and the two men in her life.  I wished for a happier ending for Henry and Vicki (the couple I was rooting for through all five books), but Huff at least leaves her readers with the impression that things will work themselves out in the years to come. Tanya Huff is a very talented writer with a vibrant imagination and I cannot recommend this series enough.  \\"Blood Debt\\" is a satisfying finale for this series and is a guaranteed page-turner.

Kelley Armstrong's debut novel, \\"Bitten\\", is an unbelievably good book that captivated me from start to finish.  I utterly adored this book and could scarcely make myself put it down from the minute I started it (which caused me to lose an entire night's sleep, but WOW was it ever worth it).  \\"Bitten\\" is one of those books that you read at lightning pace, then flip right back to page one when you reach the end because you can't bear to part with the characters yet.

Filled with romance, horror, mystery, and some of the most compelling characters I've come across in a long time, \\"Bitten\\" will enthrall, delight, and electrify readers everywhere!<br />Elena Michaels has spent the last year living a relatively normal and quiet life in Toronto.  She has a steady job as a journalist, a nice apartment, and a caring boyfriend.  But Elena is no ordinary woman; she is, in fact, the only female werewolf in existence.  Bitten by her werewolf fianc$B!&(Band defeating the odds by surviving, Elena has never gotten over his betrayal.  After nearly ten years with her pack in New York State, Elena decided to leave them and try to make the stable, happy life she has always dreamed of.  And things have been going just fine for the last year, until her pack leader, Jeremy, leaves her an urgent message, summoning her home to deal with a pack emergency.  Determined not to be pulled back into her old life, Elena heads off to New York, resolute that she will find out what the problem is and then go back to Toronto.  But upon arriving at Jeremy's estate, Stonehaven, Elena feels the unmistakable joy of coming home.<br />But there are many things to deal with at Stonehaven.  Perhaps the most difficult for Elena is dealing with her ex-fianc$B!&(Band lover, Clayton.  Clay is still and always will be deeply in love with Elena, though he is an incredibly complicated man.  Bitten as a very smallchild, Clay somehow survived the Change and lived alone as an animal for years before Jeremy found him and took him in.  Though he is brilliant, Clay is ruled by his animal instincts, making him a passionate, but often volatile man.  But Elena cannot deny the pull she feels towards Clay, and the passion and love they share is both incredibly erotic and achingly beautiful.  I absolutely fell in love with Clay and Elena as a couple, and was rooting for them the whole way through.<br />Unfortunately for Elena, dealing with her confused and powerful feelings for Clay is the least of her worries.  A group of non-pack werewolves, known as mutts, have invaded the pack's home, killing humans and leaving them in Jeremy's forest.  The mutts are bent on exposing and destroying the pack, and they are coming dangerously close to succeeding.  The entire pack is called to Stonehaven to help, though they are only seven strong, including the steadfast Antonio and his fun-loving playboy son, Nick, the considerate Peter, and Elena's good friend Logan.  Werewolf genes are passed down only through the males of the species, and women who are bitten virtually never survive the Change.  As the only female werewolf, Elena is a very sought after woman, and the entire pack knows that the mutts will try to take her for their own if they get the chance.<br />Unable to leave her pack when they need her, Elena works with Jeremy and the others to try and figure out what the mutts are really up to and how to stop them.  But the mutts are strong and ruthless and they take a deadly toll on the pack.  Armstrong weaves a hugely suspenseful tale, and readers will become engrossed in the pack's fight to destroy the mutts before the mutts destroy them.  The pack's fight for their territory and their lives is absolutely gripping, and is mixed seamlessly with the evolving relationship between Elena and Clayton.  The tale builds towards an exhilarating climax that is sure to have readers on the edge of their seats, and Armstrong provides a wonderfully satisfying conclusion.<br />\\"Bitten\\" is a downright superb novel, a sparkling and inspired tale of love and suspense that will make every reader an instant Kelley Armstrong fan.  It's delicious and sinful, and is best described as a compulsive page-turner!  Armstrong provides readers with a fascinating and perceptive view of wolf society, and when the characters are in wolf form, their actions ring true.  Each character is vivid, real, and brilliantly portrayed, from the controlled and compassionate pack alpha, Jeremy, to the fabulously strong, stubborn, and loyal heroine Elena.  The suspense quite literally had my heart pounding and the adrenaline pumping through me, and the story came vibrantly to life inside my head.  \\"Bitten\\" is an original and outstanding novel, and it's hard to believe it's Armstrong's first one.

Though it's a very quick read I found this book to be fun, intriguing, and suspenseful.  The mystery kept me turning pages, and Kinsey is a wonderful creation, portrayed in a realistic and interesting manner.<br />Kinsey Millhone is a 32-year-old Private Investigator living in Santa Teresa, California.  She's a solitary and independent woman, and a fascinating character.  One day, Nikki Fife, who has just been released from prison after doing 8 years for the murder of her cheating husband, Laurence Fife, approaches Kinsey and requests her help in finding the person who really killed Laurence and let her take the fall.  After careful consideration Kinsey decides to take the case, and so she begins to investigate.<br />Almost immediately, Kinsey finds out about another murder committed only days after Laurence's that is strikingly similar.  The victim was the accountant for Laurence's law firm, a woman by the name of Libby Glass, and she was killed using an identical method, oleander poisoning.  Determined to discover the connection between the two murders, and find out who committed them, Kinsey gets to work, but the trail is 8-years-old and she knows it won't be easy to find the truth.<br />Never one to be discouraged, Kinsey gets to know the key players.  There's Charlie Scorsoni, Laurence's law partner at the time of his death, a magnetically attractive older man who Kinsey finds irresistible and who soon becomes her lover.  There's also Gwen, Laurence's rather bitter first wife who was tossed aside when Nikki came along and was financially ruined in the divorce.  Kinsey is also intent on tracking down Sharon Napier, Laurence's inept secretary, and the only person who Laurence ever tolerated attitude from.<br />So Kinsey begins to build a picture of the people involved and the circumstances that lead up to Laurence's murder.  But whoever has been sitting pretty for 8 years while Nikki paid for the murder is not too pleased with Kinsey poking around and uncovering facts that could lead her to the truth.  Indeed, Kinsey is in serious danger, and as she struggles to put the puzzle together, someone is working very hard at making sure she doesn't.  Grafton builds the suspense effectively, and the lead up to the climax of the story had me tearing through the pages, dying to find out how it would all be resolved.<br />\\"A is for Alibi\\" is, quite simply, a great mystery, though I would have liked it to be a little longer.  With great characters and a tight plot full of twists and turns this book left me satisfied and looking forward to my next visit with Kinsey.  \\"A is for Alibi\\" is well worth reading, so pick it up today and get ready for a fabulous mix of murder, betrayal, passion, and suspense!	2002-12-08

I have been utterly delighted all year by not only Nora's new works, but also her old reprinted works that up until now I haven't been able to find.  I hope that Silhouette doesn't stop until ALL of Nora's old works are back in print, because I will buy every one.  The theme of this book, danger, works beautifully in tying these three tales together.  Each story is unique, exciting, and romantic, and there isn't one I didn't like.  <br />\\"Risky Business\\" introduces Liz Palmer, who owns a dive shop on the idyllic island of Cozumel in the Mexican Caribbean.

And Jonas Sharpe, Jerry's twin brother, has come to Cozumel to find out who killed his brother and why.  Immediately drawn to the lovely Liz, Jonas knows he needs to stay close to her if he's going to solve this mystery.  Somebody thinks Liz knows more than she's saying, and Liz knows her life is in danger.  So she agrees to work with Jonas to find Jerry's killer, hoping she can get her life back to normal in time for her 10-year-old daughter, Faith, to come home for the summer.  But as Jonas and Liz work together, plunging themselves into a very dangerous situation, they fall in love.  Their romance is nicely portrayed by Roberts, and readers will find themselves caught up in it.  But Liz has been hurt terribly in the past by Faith's father, and her fear of reliving such unbearable pain may just cause her to give up the one man who can make her whole again!<BR>\\"Risky Business\\" is a fabulous tale of romantic suspense.  With characters who readers will root for and a thrilling mystery to solve amidst the romance, this story is sure to captivate and satisfy.<br />\\"Storm Warning\\" is by far the shortest story out of the three, but Roberts packs a whole lot of excitement and passion into it.  Autumn Gallegher has come to her Aunt Tabby's lovely inn in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains for a relaxing family visit.  But she never expected to come face to face with the man who brutally broke her heart three years earlier, acclaimed author Lucas McLean.  After three years, Autumn's feelings for Lucas haven't changed, and it's impossible to deny the love that still burns brightly in her heart just for him.  But all is not well at the Pine View Inn, and on the night of a particularly fierce storm, one of the guests is found murdered.  The group staying at the inn is a mixed bunch, and everyone's a suspect.  The stress of dealing with Lucas and his strange mood swings, as well as the murder, has Autumn on the edge.  And when the evidence begins to indicate that Lucas may be guilty of the murder, Autumn doesn't know whether to believe it, or to trust in the man she loves.<BR>\\"Storm Warning\\" is a fantastically suspenseful tale and Roberts creates a brilliantly tense and chilling atmosphere.  As Autumn tries to get to the truth about the murder and about how Lucas really feels about her, the reader becomes completely absorbed in her dilemma.  Will Lucas and Autumn find a way to be together?  Or will murder and past hurts keep them from rekindling their love?<br />\\"The Welcoming\\" is the final story, and it is superb, my favourite of the lot.  Roman DeWinter is an agent with the FBI, sent to Orcas Island in the San Juans for what appears to be a routine assignment.  A criminal organization has been running out of an island inn, and it's Roman's job to bring it down, along with whoever is working from the inside.  The Bureau believes that the guilty party is the owner, Charity Ford.  Charity hires Roman, who claims to be an out of work drifter, as her handyman, allowing the investigation to proceed smoothly.  But Roman never counted on falling in love with Charity, and on her falling in love with him.  Convinced that Charity couldn't possibly be a part of the criminal organization, Roman sets about finding a way to prove her innocence.  Charity and Roman's romance is utterly engrossing, filled with love, tenderness, and red-hot passion.  But Roman is constantly troubled by the thought of how he is deceiving Charity, and is terrified that she won't be able to forgive him when she finds out the truth.  Will their love be enough to overcome any obstacle?  Or will Roman's dishonesty destroy Charity's faith in him forever?<BR>\\"The Welcoming\\" rounds out this anthology perfectly, leaving readers utterly sated and yet desperate for more from the incomparable Nora Roberts.  Charity and Roman are strong, well-developed characters, and Roberts weaves their romance with the suspense and danger seamlessly.<br />The fact of the matter is, I have only good things to say about \\"Dangerous\\" and I can't recommend it more to other readers.  Roberts always manages to transport me into the lives and hearts of her characters, making them seem so incredibly real that I wouldn't be surprised to meet them walking down the street.  Silhouette did a marvellous job of choosing three stories that fit together brilliantly; linked by the common element of danger, but were different enough that each one was distinctive and totally original.  This is a Nora Roberts anthology you don't want to miss, so buy it today!	2002-12-06

Suspenseful, Intriguing, Ingenious!	&quot;Laws of the Blood: Deceptions&quot; is my first Susan Sizemore novel ever, and though I came in on #4 of the series, it was surprisingly easy to become engrossed in this dark and seductive world of vampires.  &quot;Deceptions&quot; is a gripping tale peppered with sporadic and brutal violence, smart writing, wit, humour, and some kick butt characters!  I must add, however, that the story seemed a bit slow to get going, though this may be a byproduct of my coming in on the 4th book in the series.  But once the story did get going, I couldn't put the book down.  Upon reflection, I think I would enjoy the first hundred pages much more a second time around.<br />&quot;Deceptions&quot; tells the story of Olympias, an immensely powerful vampire who has long reigned as the Enforcer of Washington D.C.  She was once the wife of Phillip of Macedon and mother of Alexander the Great, and her age can be measured in millennia.  But Olympias is in for some trouble.  A gifted psychic and his team working on a top secret government project are on the verge of discovering the existence of vampires, and it's Olympias's job to make sure they don't.  Which normally would be a simple enough matter, only she has fallen in love with the leader of the project, military man Mike Falconer.  To make matters worse, Mike is the very same man that one of the baby vampires in the area has chosen for her companion.  Add in Olympias's human servant, Sara, questioning her master's choices and becoming dangerously preoccupied with a suicidal vampire, and things are starting to get uncomfortable for Olympias.<br />And into this scene rife with unrest has walked a very dangerous man, Roger Bentencourt.  He's the companion of one of the local nest leaders and he bears a deadly grudge against Olympias. Determined to bring about Olympias's destruction, he'll use every problem and frustration to his own advantage.  And while Olympias is preoccupied by her complicated romance with Mike Falconer and dealing with a dozen situations begging for her attention, Bentencourt may just succeed!<br />&quot;Deceptions&quot; is fast-paced, exciting, and entertaining.  The characters are strong and well developed and I really grew to like both Olympias and Falconer.  Olympias's much-loved hellhound, is wonderful, and is one of my favourite characters! This book is not for the faint of heart, but Sizemore has created a fascinating and original society of vampires, known as the Strigoi in this series, that vampire fiction and fantasy fans will NOT want to miss.  &quot;Deceptions&quot; is compelling, riveting, and sometimes shocking fare, and I, for one, loved it.  I'd like to see Olympias get a second book, as she most certainly deserves, if not demands one!  So read this book, it comes highly recommended.	2002-12-03
US	43021965	R336H8LJZG7DO2	0671015575	777171397	The Plot Thickens	Books	4	95	96	N	N	Enjoyable Mystery Anthology!	\\"The Plot Thickens\\" is an anthology containing eleven stories from eleven of today's top mystery and suspense writers.  To be honest, I hunted this book down solely for Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum short story, but found I enjoyed the whole thing.  \\"The Plot Thickens\\" was written for a great cause, to raise money to fight illiteracy in the U.S., so you can feel good about where your money is going.  Some of the stories are better than others and individual opinions will undoubtedly vary, but each tale includes a thick fog, a thick book, and a thick steak, and it's fun seeing how each author chose to work in those three elements.<br />1. \\"How Far it Could Go\\" by Lawrence Block is probably my least favourite story of the anthology.  A man and a woman meet in a restaurant to discuss using violence to dissuade the woman's ex-husband from suing her, but how far will it go?  Thin on plot, but Block creates an interesting mood. **1/2<br />2. \\"Foolproof\\" by Edna Buchanan tells the tale of an ancient Egyptian mummy autopsied and fingerprinted for interests' sake.  But the findings bring to light a millennia's old unsolved murder and cast doubt on the only foolproof form of crime scene evidence.  An intriguing and enjoyable story. ****<br />3. \\"The Man Next Door\\" by Mary Higgins Clark is a great, suspenseful story.  When a young woman becomes the latest unwilling houseguest of her serial killer neighbour, the race is on to find her before it's too late.  A well-written and exciting tale. *****<br />4. \\"Too Many Cooks\\" by Carol Higgins Clark introduces a struggling young actress who gets a break when she's chosen to play a cook in a steak sauce commercial.  But she soon finds herself caught up in some real life drama and betrayal.  A fun and entertaining story. ****<br />5. \\"Revenge and Rebellion\\" by Nelson & Lauren DeMille is a deliciously twisted tale.  When a woman gives her treasured autobiographical manuscript to her good friend who works as a literary agent, he getsa disturbing glimpse of the world through her eyes.  But the aspiring author doesn't take criticism lightly, and lost in her own delusions, there's no telling what she'll do.  A very good story. ****<br />6. \\"The Last Peep\\" by Janet Evanovich is a Stephanie Plum story well worth tracking down.  This time, bounty hunter Stephanie is on the trail of a burg resident with a penchant for peeping in windows and showing off his personal wares.  But when she discovers his dead, naked body, which subsequently disappears, she's thrust into the middle of an exciting, and very amusing, mystery.  A mystery that she is bound and determined to solve, with a little help from sidekick Lula and Grandma Mazur.  A hilarious, well-written, and wonderful story. *****<br />7. \\"Going Under\\" by Linda Fairstein is a fun and original tale.  An ambitious young police officer gets her big chance to make detective, as long as she's willing to let a dentist with wandering hands have his way with her once he puts her under!  I really liked this story. ****<br />8. \\"Thick-Headed\\" by Walter Mosley is a good story, though a bit tough to follow.  When a man hired to transport a car finds a dead body in the trunk of that car, he goes to his closest friend for advice.  And the two of them get themselves in deeper and deeper with angry mobsters, more bodies, and criminal schemes. ***1/2<br />9. \\"Love's Cottage\\" by Nancy Pickard is an original and enjoyable tale.  A black servant details her arrival in a strange new household with her husband, and the events that led to a terrible tragedy. ****<br />10. \\"The Road Trip\\" by Ann Rule is an excellent story and one of the anthology's best.  When a newly divorced woman heads on a business road trip, it provides her with the welcome opportunity to get away from her maniacal, jealous, and possessive ex-husband.  But instead of getting some much-needed relaxation, she finds herself in the midst of a new and infinitely worse nightmare when she becomes the next target of an infamous serial killer.  A tightly plotted and thrilling story. *****<br />11. \\"Take it Away\\" by Donald E. Westlake rounds out the anthology nicely.  When an FBI agent on a stakeout of a notorious art thief goes to get fast food for his team, a coincidental conversation with the next man in line turns out to be much, much more than it seems.  A fun and intriguing tale. ****<br />Overall, \\"The Plot Thickens\\" is an entertaining mystery anthology that will satisfy readers.  My favourite stories were the ones by Mary Higgins Clark, Janet Evanovich, and Ann Rule, but each and every one was worth reading.  So give \\"The Plot Thickens\\" a try, and do your part in the fight against illiteracy.	2002-11-27

It's shocking and affecting, it tore at my heart and made me cry, and it horrified and amazed me.  I absolutely could not put this book down and stayed up all night to finish it.  \\"Blood Pact\\" is a book you don't want to miss; it's suspenseful, frightening, thought provoking, and heart-rending.  But most importantly it is, quite simply, a highly entertaining, great read!<br />\\"Blood Pact\\" begins with Vicki Nelson, ex-cop and now Private Investigator, receiving the news every child, no matter how old, lives in fear of.  Her mother, whose phone calls she has been avoiding recently, has died suddenly of a heart defect.  Wracked with guilt and already annoyed with the two men in her life, 450-year-old romance-writing vampire Henry Fitzroy and homicide detective Mike Celluci, Vicki leaves Toronto for Kingston to lay her mother to rest.<br />Unfortunately, Vicki's coping skills are failing her, and dealing with her mother's sympathetic co-workers isn't helping.  Luckily, Henry and Mike both discover what has happened, and head off to Kingston to support Vicki in the midst of this tragedy.  But things just keep getting worse, as Vicki's mother's body is stolen from the funeral home.  Convinced that the police will not put much effort into the case, Vicki sets out to find her mother on her own, stubbornly refusing to grieve for her loss or even acknowledge her pain, and heading straight for a nervous breakdown.  Henry and Mike are truly frightened about Vicki's mental state, and the two of them decide to put aside their differences and work together, in hopes of preserving Vicki's sanity.<br />But then, one terrible night, the unimaginable occurs.  Sitting in her mother's apartment Vicki hears a noise at the window and opens the curtains to reveal her mother on the other side of the glass, unmistakably dead and yet somehow horribly alive.  This grim discovery leads Vicki, Henry, and Mike on a disturbing and perilous hunt for a group of scientists experimenting with resurrecting the dead through the use of bacteria.<br />And Huff's portrayal of this group of scientists is genuinely disturbing.  Indeed, the real monsters in this book are not the zombies at all, but the humans creating them.  Their utter lack of humanity and their clinical indifference to the suffering they cause is appalling, and Vicki's mother is just another experiment to them.  Sickened by what she has discovered and all the more determined to bring those who stole her mother to justice, Vicki leads Henry and Mike into very dangerous territory.  The story is full of twists and turns and heart-pounding suspense, as Vicki, Henry and Mike must deal with a situation that seems more nightmare than reality.  <br />\\"Blood Pact\\" is an utterly riveting read with a shocking surprise ending.  The final chapters are full of thrills and chills and unspeakable horrors, and yet at the same time are a testament to the undiluted beauty and power of love.  Huff manages to elicit a diverse range of emotions from her readers, and her moving tale had tears streaming down my cheeks.  It is impossible not to become completely wrapped up in the lives of Vicki, Henry, and Mike, and the tension created by their strange love triangle is intense.  \\"Blood Pact\\" is a brilliant mixture of horror, mystery, fantasy and romance, and it is sure to take you for a ride you won't soon forget!	2002-11-24
US	43021965	RUVX5N5XSUO2V	0312983271	746882277	Full House (Max Holt No. 1)	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Light and Fun for Romance Fans, Mystery Fans Beware.	\\"Full House\\" by Janet Evanovich is a re-printed and re-written version of an early romance novel by the author of the hugely popular Stephanie Plum mystery series.  And in my opinion, it's because of the fact that the majority of the people buying this book are mystery fans, not romance fans, that \\"Full House\\" has gotten such a bad reputation.  It is mismarketing by the publisher and bookstores to house this book in the mystery section, which was where I found it, but as light and fluffy romances go, \\"Full House\\" is not half bad.  And this book is undeniably a romance novel.  As far as a rating goes, I'm wavering between three and four stars.  I honestly did enjoy the story and found myself completely entertained by this light and amusing tale.  But there were a few things that took away from my enjoyment, most notably, the atrocious editing job.  There were glaring errors scattered liberally throughout the book, including the changing of some main characters names!  I'd like to give \\"Full House\\" four stars, because I really did like it, but because of the markedly poor editing I'm dropping it down to three (if I could I'd compromise with ***1/2).<br />\\"Full House\\" tells the story of Billie Pearce, a divorced mother of two who finds herself lonely and bored when her children go away on vacation with their father.  Deciding to try something new, Billie signs up for polo lessons.  The actual polo is a disaster, but her polo instructor, wealthy playboy Nick Kaharchek, is another story.  After having her foot stomped on by a horse, Billie is taken to the hospital by Nick, and their fascination with one another begins.<br />Used to sophisticated and snobby women, Nick is drawn to the lovely, warm, and real Billie.  And Billie finds Nick irresistible, though she's sure a handsome, rich, and exciting man like him would never be interested in her.  But there is an intense chemistry that sparks between them, that neither Nick nor Billie can deny, and they begin a fun, romantic, and somewhat unusual courtship.<br />Things start to get crazy when Nick convinces Billie to let his cousin Deedee stay with her until her upcoming wedding, and Billie inherits a redheaded whirlwind!  Billie finds Deedee utterly exhausting, and quite annoying, not to mention the presence of her enormous fiancé, wrestler Frankie the assassin.  Billie's not quite sure how things got so out of control, but she knows that Nick Kaharchek is to blame.  Not that she's able to stay mad at him.  <br />And Nick has lots of problems worse than Deedee, including her cousin Max, a young genius in hiding on Nick's vast property, on a mission that involves blowing things up and generally running amok.  Billie finds this a little frightening, but she has other things to worry about too, like Nick's jealous and nasty ex-fiancée.  Add in Billie's bug-killing neighbour and a touch of mystery near the end, and you have yourself an offbeat, light, and pleasant romance.  <br />There isn't a whole lot of conflict between the main characters, nor in the story as a whole, really.  It's just a quick and fun read that can be read, enjoyed and then most likely forgotten.  \\"Full House\\" isn't a fabulous, standout novel, but it's not awful either.  My advice is that even if you're a big Evanovich fan; if you don't like romances, don't read this book.  But if you enjoy romances and non-demanding, feel-good tales then \\"Full House\\" is worth the read.	2002-11-20

It contains a thrilling and suspenseful plot perfectly blended with the tantalizing love triangle between Private Investigator Vicki Nelson, 450 year-old vampire romance writer Henry Fitzroy, and homicide detective Mike Celluci.  \\"Blood Lines\\" is an excellent addition to the series and is sure to be widely enjoyed.<br />The story begins with the arrival of an Egyptian sarcophagus at the Royal Ontario Museum.  The staff is excited about what and who it may contain, but they don't know the half of it.  For the mummy lying inside is an ancient Egyptian wizard who challenged the gods at the height of his power and was subsequently entombed alive.  For thousands of years he has lain in darkness, unable to escape his living death, until now.<br />Strange and frightening things begin happening at the museum after the sarcophagus is opened and the mummy uncovered.  Two men die sudden and inexplicable deaths and then the entire museum staff selectively forgets that there ever was a mummy.  Because the ancient wizard, now awake and planning his overthrow of the city and the reinstatement of his dark god's reign, has been growing stronger by feeding on the lives of those around him.  Armed with knowledge of the 20th century stolen from his victims, the mummy takes the name Anwar Tawfik and goes out into the city.  And so this ancient evil is loosed upon an unsuspecting Toronto.<br />Mike Celluci, Vicki Nelson's ex-partner on the force and sometime lover, can see that something is not right.  He finds clues at the museum that deny the statements given by the museum staff, and after the things he's seen in the recent past, Mike's willing to believe in a supernatural explanation.  Henry Fitzroy, Vicki's other lover and the bastard son of Henry VIII, no less, is haunted by dreams of a blazing desert sun.  And being a vampire, this is pretty terrifying for Henry, whobelieves that his recurring dream signifies some hidden desire to commit suicide.  So Henry enlists Vicki's help to watch over him and keep him from frying himself, and Mike recruits her to help him find out what is going on.<br />As Tawfik becomes more and more powerful, he gains control of some people in high places, leaving Vicki, Mike, and Henry to fight him all alone.  And it's not long before the clues, Henry's instincts, and some blind luck add up to give these three a fairly accurate picture of what's going on.  Tawfik is so power hungry that he is prepared to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, and his plans include a ceremony that will make him almost unstoppable.  <br />So it's up to Vicki, Mike, and Henry to find a way to stop Tawfik and save Toronto.  The suspense builds very effectively, and Huff takes her readers on a thrilling adventure.  \\"Blood Lines\\" is intriguing, tightly plotted, and exciting.  Not to mention the fabulous romance between Henry and Vicki (my favourite couple) and Mike and Vicki, which provides some intense sexual tension along with some highly amusing moments that balance the horror and suspense perfectly. <br />All in all, \\"Blood Lines\\" is an entertaining and worthwhile read.  Vicki is a fantastic heroine.  She's strong and stubborn, but not without vulnerabilities.  I adore Henry, and can't help but like Mike.  The story is a fascinating mix of horror, mystery, fantasy, and romance and Huff makes it work beautifully.  The entire \\"Blood\\" series is worth reading, though I strongly advise you read them in order.  \\"Blood Lines\\" will not disappoint, so pick it up today and enjoy!	2002-11-19

The much-anticipated tale of Seth Quinn has finally arrived, and it was well worth the wait.  Nora Roberts has written a romantic, insightful, and touching tale that stays true to the original trilogy and is sure to have readers everywhere cheering and begging for more.  <br />Seth Quinn, the troubled and angry young boy adopted by Cam, Ethan, and Phillip after the death of their father, Ray Quinn, is all grown up and coming home.  Now a successful painter who has conquered Europe, all Seth wants is to return to the big white house on the bay and be with his family.  Troubled by a secret that has weighed on him heavily for more than a decade, Seth needs the peace that only home can bring.  <br />And it is absolutely wonderful to see all of the characters we fell in love with in the previous three books.  We see the most of Cam and Anna, because Seth lives with them, but Ethan and Grace, and Phillip and Sybill are never far away.  Though 18 years have passed, not a whole lot has changed as far as the Quinn family dynamics are concerned (though the family has grown considerably), which I was immensely relieved to see.  Grace and Ethan's daughter Aubrey is all grown up as well, and is a very important part of Seth's life.  <br />Though some things never change, like the love and support Seth's family will always provide, there have been some changes in his hometown of St. Christopher.  The most fascinating of which is the arrival of Drusilla Whitcomb-Banks, who has moved from D.C. and opened a flower shop.  Intrigued by the beautiful Drusilla, Seth sets about trying to get to know her better.  Dru, who comes from a wealthy and influential family, has come to St. Chris to get away from the demands of her previous life.  Seth is determined to paint the lovely Drusilla, and as he convinces her to pose for him, and spends asmuch time with her as possible, the two of them begin to fall in love.<br />The romance between Seth and Dru is beautifully rendered and sure to touch readers' hearts.  Drusilla is slow to trust and wary of relationships, but her misgivings are no match for Seth's charm, warmth, and love.  Seth and Dru make a fabulous couple, and I was completely caught up in their developing relationship.  <br />But trouble is brewing on the horizon, and the painful secret that Seth has been hiding for years is about to come back with a vengeance.  Linked to his painful past, Seth's secret has the ability to destroy his new love and hurt his family.  Conflicted, unhappy, and determined to keep Dru and his beloved family out of the mess he is in, Seth is heading for disaster.  Will Seth trust in Dru's love, bite the bullet, and tell her and his family the truth?  The tight knit Quinn clan always sticks together when one of them is in trouble, but they can't help Seth if they don't know what's wrong.  Will some visitations from the ghost of Stella Quinn be enough to convince Seth to share his burden?  Or will Seth let his past destroy his newfound love and happiness?   <br />\\"Chesapeake Blue\\" is a truly heart-warming and affecting tale that had me smiling and wiping away tears throughout.  Seth Quinn is a great hero, and readers are guaranteed to fall in love with the sensitive, strong, and fun-filled man who grew from a scared and angry boy.  Dru is, likewise, a great heroine.  She's independent, determined, and a very loving person when you get below the surface.  Add in the amazing Quinn clan from the previous three novels, and you've got yourself an incredible and complex cast of characters.  Nora Roberts has an undeniable gift for creating families that readers would love to be a part of, and the Quinns are one of her greatest triumphs.  \\"Chesapeake Blue\\" is a superb read, and it focuses just as much on the love and importance of family as it does on the romance between Seth andDru.  Nora Roberts has really outdone herself with this one, so buy \\"Chesapeake Blue\\" today.	2002-11-12

On page one I was immediately transported to Trenton, NJ, and remained glued to the pages until the story came to a close.  Indeed, my only complaint is that it is far too short!  At just under 150 pages, \\"Visions of Sugar Plums\\" is over before you know it.  But one thing is for sure - I'll reread this novella several times before Christmas (and after), and it's sure to be added to the category of Holiday Classic by one and all!<br />\\"Visions of Sugar Plums\\" begins four days before Christmas, and Stephanie Plum, Trenton's favourite bounty hunter, is having trouble getting into the Christmas spirit.  She hasn't bought a single present, there's not a Christmas tree or twinkle light in sight in her apartment, and she's having trouble tracking down the elusive Sandy Claws, a toy maker who's missed his court date.  Stephanie is feeling a little stressed by the whole situation, and then, as if she needed more to deal with, a strange man suddenly appears in her kitchen.  And sure, people are always just popping up in Steph's house, but this one's different - he literally appeared out of thin air!  <br />It seems Stephanie's new visitor, Diesel, is there to get her into the Christmas spirit.  Is he a ghost, alien, vampire?  Steph doesn't know, but what she does know is that he's impossible to get rid of.  Whatever he is, he's the sexiest supernatural phenomenon that Stephanie has ever met (okay, so he's the only supernatural phenomenon she's ever met, but he's still really sexy!).  The distractingly attractive Diesel becomes Stephanie's temporary sidekick, and together, they set about trying to find Sandy Claws.  <br />But things just keep getting weirder and weirder.  Diesel meets Stephanie's family, and gets to bear witness to some serious Plum family dysfunction.  The always hilarious Grandma Mazur has a newstudmuffin, sister Valerie has a shocking Christmas surprise, Steph's niece Mary Alice doesn't believe in Santa anymore, and mom's dealing with all of this by knocking back tumblers of Red Roses in the kitchen!  Stephanie still doesn't have any presents or any Christmas spirit for that matter, and now she has to worry about a very bad guy, Mr. Ring, who is out to get Sandy Claws and Diesel.  Add in a pack of vicious little elves who assault Stephanie with cookies and a series of mysterious power outages, and you have the fabulous \\"Visions of Sugar Plums\\", guaranteed to lift the spirit and split your sides with laughter.<br />I really, really enjoyed this book.  Joe Morelli, Stephanie's gorgeous cop boyfriend makes several appearances, though fellow bounty hunter Ranger is absent, and Stephanie's usual sidekick, Lula, the 200+lb ex-ho, provides some uproarious comedic moments.  I honestly haven't laughed so much at a book in a long time.  The Grandma Mazur teeth fiasco near the end had me laughing so hard it hurt, and there are countless other priceless moments that are utterly hilarious.  Janet Evanovich has a gift for the witty and the absurd, and it's easy to see why she's so popular when you read this hugely entertaining and all-around superb novella.  The bottom line is, \\"Visions of Sugar Plums\\" is a holiday treat you do NOT want to miss.  So don't hesitate, buy this book right now, and get ready for the most fun you'll have reading a book all year!	2002-11-08

The characters are all likable and interesting, and the fact of the matter is, nobody writes romance like Nora Roberts.  I thoroughly enjoyed both of the stories that make up this book and find myself halfway in love with both the heroes.  Though I giggled at a few of the references that place these stories firmly in the eighties, these few instances are to be expected from books written more than 15 years ago and could not take away from my enjoyment of these stories as a whole.  <br />The first tale, \\"Summer Desserts\\", introduces Summer Lyndon, a world-renowned French pastry chef whose life is spent jetting from one exotic locale to another to prepare a single stunning dessert before moving on.  Summer has always avoided tying herself down to any one place, so when American hotel magnate Blake Cocharan III asks her to remodel and manage the restaurant of the Philadelphia Cocharan House, Summer's not quite sure why she doesn't just dismiss his request right away.  But the truth is, Summer can't dismiss this proposal or Blake himself.  There is an instant attraction between the two, and Blake is just as fascinated by Summer as Summer is by Blake.  Deciding it might be a welcome change in her lifestyle, Summer agrees to take the job, and gets down to work on the restaurant.<BR>But the dangerously [good looking] Blake is highly distracting to Summer, and though it's against her better judgement, she can't deny the attraction between them any longer.  A passionate and exciting romance ensues, and Blake finds himself falling in love with Summer.  Knowing his own heart and that Summer has become his life, Blake proposes, only to be rejected by a terrified and confused Summer, who has sworn off marriage because of her parents.  But though she has effectively thrown Blake out of her life, it's not so easy to get him out of her heart.  Will Summer come to her senses and realize thatsometimes love is forever?  Or will her fear of commitment keep Blake and Summer apart, and miserable, forever?<br />The second tale, \\"Lessons Learned\\", tells the story of Summer's best friend, Carlo Franconi, a world class Italian chef and notorious playboy.  Promoting his newest cookbook, Carlo travels to the U.S. where he meets his pretty publicist, Juliet Trent.  The unfailingly organized and proper Juliet intrigues Carlo from the first, and she finds him gorgeous [good looking]and totally off limits.  The two begin Carlo's three-week book tour across America, and the chemistry and tension between Carlo and Juliet intensifies each day.  Juliet never mixes business with pleasure, but the sight of dozens of beautiful women latching onto Carlo at every stop brings on an unexpected, and unwelcome, flare of jealousy.  As the tour goes on, Carlo finds his interest in other women waning rapidly, as his desire for Juliet grows.  It takes a while, but a romance between Carlo and Juliet begins.  Juliet is surprised by Carlo's innate generosity of spirit and compassion, and the tenderness and passion he shows her begins to break down her emotional defences.  <BR>It's not long before Carlo realizes that Juliet means more to him than any woman before her, and he discovers a deep vulnerability where she is concerned.  Carlo desperately needs Juliet to trust him, but that is one thing she cannot do.  Influenced by his past as a womanizer, Juliet finds it impossible to believe in Carlo's love for her.  As the tour comes to an end, Carlo is frantic not to lose Juliet, so he asks her to come to Rome with him and be his wife.  But Juliet just can't, or won't, believe in Carlo's sincerity, and so she turns her back on the only man she'll ever love.  Will Juliet come to her senses and see what's really in Carlo's heart?  Or will she stubbornly refuse to see the truth, forsaking Carlo, and her happiness, for all time?<br />\\"Lessons Learned\\" was perhaps my favourite of the two, though I loved both stories.  Reading about Carlo's demonstrations and recipes gave me an intense craving for pasta, which just goes to show you how vivid and engrossing Nora Roberts' writing is.  If you enjoy a good love story then this book is for you.  With handsome and considerate heroes and strong, independent heroines, \\"Table for Two\\" is sure to satisfy your craving for romance.  You just can't miss with Nora Roberts, and I hope Silhouette doesn't stop until ALL her old books have been re-printed.  \\"Table for Two\\" will tantalize the senses and warm the hearts of readers everywhere, and I most definitely recommend it!	2002-11-07

A Captivating Read!	\\"Summer Knight\\" by Jim Butcher is the fantastic fourth instalment in the Dresden Files series, and it may just be the best book to date.  Butcher has once again created a hugely entertaining mix of genres, blending fantasy, mystery, horror and comedy into one witty and compelling tale.  \\"Summer Knight\\" is a fun-filled and riveting read that had me turning pages all through the night, and I can't recommend it enough!<br />\\"Summer Knight\\" begins with our hero, Harry Dresden, Chicago's only professional wizard, in a deep depression.  He has spent nearly all his time of late down in his sub-basement lab, trying to find a way to reverse what happened to his girlfriend Susan, who he lost to the vampires in the last book, \\"Grave Peril\\".  Not only is he mourning the loss of the woman he had just discovered he loved, he is also dealing with the guilt of starting a deadly war between the White Council of wizards and the Vampire's Red Court.  Attempts on Harry's life come almost daily, and he is barely able to survive them in the sorry state he is in.  Harry still has a few friends left in the world, including the Alphas, a group of young adult werewolves who we first met in \\"Fool Moon\\", and Lieutenant Karrin Murphy, head of Special Investigations in the Chicago PD.  <br />But Harry's few remaining friends aren't going to be able to save him from his own people.  The White Council is coming to Chicago to deal with Harry and the mess he has caused with the Vampires, and they are none to pleased with him.  And when you factor in Harry's less stellar past with the White Council, it seems Harry may not have to worry about the bad guys at all.  Because unless he can figure out something fast, the White Council is going to get rid of Harry permanently.<br />Then Mab, the Winter Queen of Faerie, makes Harry a proposition he literally can't refuse.  All Harry has to do is find out who murdered the Summer Queen's Knight, retrieve what was stolen from him, and prove that Mab isn't responsible.  If Harry can do that, Mab will give the White Council free passage through the land of Winter Faerie in the Nevernever, which would give them a huge edge in their war against the vampires.  Harry needs to do this to keep himself from being executed by the White Council, but getting involved in faerie politics is a potentially fatal endeavour.  Not that Harry has much of a choice in the matter.<br />So Harry sets about trying to solve the mystery of the Summer Knight's death, enlisting the help of the Alphas and Murphy whenever possible.  But someone definitely doesn't want Harry to figure this out.  Attacks on Harry and his allies occur with a frightening regularity.  In addition, Harry must speak with the five other Queens of Faerie, each of whom might just murder him on sight!  With so many complications, Harry has to pull himself together and think fast, which he does.  In \\"Summer Knight\\" Harry seems to come into his own, finally taking charge and giving the bad guys a run for their money.  And it's darn important that he does so, because the fate of the mortal world depends on Harry solving this mystery and preventing the impending war between Summer and Winter!<br />\\"Summer Knight\\" is action-packed and filled with thrills and excitement.  The suspense builds to a gripping final showdown that will have readers tearing through the pages.  Harry's wonderful self-depreciating sense of humour and dry wit are present throughout, creating the perfect atmosphere for the story.  Butcher has penned an absolutely fabulous tale, with a well-thought-out out plot and characters who readers can't help but be intrigued by.  \\"Summer Knight\\" is an all-around excellent read, and you'll be sorry if you miss it.  I guarantee you'll love Harry Dresden and all his adventures, so buy this book today!	2002-11-01

Butcher has yet again created a compelling mix of horror, mystery, fantasy, romance and comedy, and these elements are expertly blended into one un-put-downable tale.  Our hero, Harry Dresden, Chicago's only professional wizard, continues to evolve as a character, and his tongue-in-cheek narration is a delight.  Harry is an immensely likable hero, and despite his haplessness, readers will really enjoy getting to know him.<br />\\"Grave Peril\\" begins with Harry and his friend Michael, a Knight of the Cross with a sword blessed by God, running all over Chicago trying to control an outbreak of malicious spirits.  Indeed, the spirit world has gone postal, and countless rampaging ghosts have been attacking unsuspecting individuals.  As the book opens, Harry and Michael must rush to the hospital in order to stop a dangerous ghost with an unhealthy affection for infants.  Their attempt to destroy the ghost doesn't go as planned, and Harry and Michael are forced to follow her into the Nevernever.  And though Harry eventually succeeds in destroying this particular spirit, his troubles are only just beginning.  He discovers that these ghosts aren't going crazy of their own accord, that someone or something is placing a torture spell on them.  And while Harry's trying to digest that disturbing bit of new information, he has a terrifying run-in with his faerie godmother.  Harry made a deal with Lea, his godmother, when he was much younger and in a lot of trouble, and now she wants to collect her payment.  The only thing is, it's Harry she wants to collect!<br />After managing to escape from the Nevernever and his godmother (for now) Harry sets about trying to discover who could be responsible for the horrifying torture spells being placed on Chicago's spirits.  Evidence of a frighteningly powerful and vicious spirit has Harry feeling distinctly nervous, since this spirit has done things that just shouldn't be possible.  And then Harry is accosted by two vampires representing madam Bianca; the vampire Harry made a mortal enemy of in \\"Storm Front\\".  Bianca has been promoted in the ranks of the Vampire's Red Court, and as a member of the White Council of wizards, Harry is obliged to attend the celebration.  Harry's girlfriend Susan, a reporter for a paper specializing in the supernatural, is desperate to attend for the story, but Harry knows just how much Bianca wants her revenge and that attending is out of the question.  So Harry just won't go right?  Wrong.  A series of disasters and nasty encounters leaves Harry between a rock and a hard place.  Whoever is doing these torture spells is now putting them on people as well, Harry's friends no less, and Harry needs to catch the culprit right away.  After nearly getting killed several times and losing Michael's holy sword, making things even worse with his godmother, and letting a young and frightened girl who he agreed to protect fall into the hands of some very nasty people, Harry's last hope is to attend Bianca's party, where he's sure the person or thing causing all of this will be.<br />From this point on, \\"Grave Peril\\" takes readers on a thrilling and suspenseful adventure filled with unexpected twists and turns.  Harry gets himself and those around him into deeper and deeper trouble as the story builds towards a gripping climax.  \\"Grave Peril\\" kept me riveted the whole way through, and I couldn't wait to start the next in the series, \\"Summer Knight\\", when it came to a close.  The secondary characters, such as Harry's friend Lieutenant Karrin Murphy and Bob, Harry's over-sexed air spirit assistant residing in a human skull, are wonderful and always amusing.  Harry is a fabulous character, and his witty narrative makes \\"Grave Peril\\" just that much more enjoyable.  So take my word for it, Jim Butcher's Dresden Files is a series you don't want to miss.  \\"Grave Peril\\" is a fun, exciting, and hugely entertaining mix of mystery and fantasy, so buy it today!	2002-10-30

The three tales that make up this book are wonderfully matched and I loved each and every one.  I can't even choose a favourite; each one was unique, compelling, and fun to read!  I was utterly charmed and satisfied by this Silhouette reprint and I'm sure you will be too.  <br />\\"Unfinished Business\\" introduces Vanessa Sexton, a hugely successful but strung-out concert pianist, who is returning to her small home town for the first time in 12 years to get some answers from her estranged mother.  But the one thing Vanessa never expected to find was her high school sweetheart Brady Tucker, who broke her heart on the night of his senior prom.  Brady had his reasons for what happened that night, but after only minutes in Vanessa's company this bad boy turned doctor realizes there's a lot of unfinished business between them, and that Vanessa can still turn him inside out with one of her pouty looks!  <BR>Vanessa slowly begins rebuilding a tentative relationship with her mother, while trying to sort out the powerful emotions Brady stirs up in her.  Vanessa knows that she's still intensely drawn to Brady, despite her lingering hurt from what happened 12 years ago.  Confused and in emotional turmoil about her life, Vanessa finds that Brady is the best person to turn to.  And the more time they spend together, the more Brady and Vanessa come to see that they never stopped loving each other.  <BR>But Vanessa is feeling lost and uncertain as to what her future holds for her.  Though her music is a vital part of who she is, she's not sure she wants to continue with the stressful life she's been leading.  Vanessa is afraid that what she and Brady feel for each other is only an echo of remembered love, and her insecurities about herself lead her to start pushing Brady away.  Will Vanessa see through her self-doubt to the truth and find love and happiness in Brady's arms?  Or will she turn her back on the only man she'll ever love?<br />\\"Island of Flowers\\" tells the story of Laine Simmons, a young boarding school teacher from France who has traveled to Hawaii on a whim in hopes of finding her father.  Laine is awed by the paradise in which her father lives, and Roberts' brilliant descriptions make the island of Kauai come alive.  <BR>And though Laine didn't expect her estranged father to greet her with open arms, she was totally unprepared for his sexy, and hostile, business partner, Dillon O'Brian.  Dillon believes Laine has ulterior motives for this reunion with her father, and a misunderstanding regarding years of unreceived gifts and correspondence leaves Laine without a way to clear her name.  So she simply goes about trying to get to know the father she never had, but while he's busy with work at his airport, Laine spends a lot of time with Dillon.  <BR>And despite his suspicions about Laine's intentions, Dillon just can't stop thinking about her.  As they get to know each other, Dillon falls hard for the unbelievably innocent and sweet Laine.  And the lovely young Laine finds herself caught up in a storm of unfamiliar and intense emotions, as the passion between her and Dillon grows.  But even though they have both fallen in love, they won't admit it to each other.  Afraid of Dillon accusing her of being a gold-digger, Laine stubbornly keeps her true feelings to herself.  So when a terrible misunderstanding sends Dillon into a hurt rage, it prompts Laine to take her broken heart and leave.  Is there any way to overcome the pain and misery that Dillon's mistrust has caused?  Or will they be denied the lifetime of love and happiness they could have found together?<br />\\"Mind Over Matter\\" introduces Aurora \\"A.J.\\" Fields, a tough and respected Hollywood agent.

A.J. and David spend a lot of time negotiating a deal, and the more time he spends with her, the more David becomes intrigued by A.J.<BR>A.J. too feels a strong pull towards David, and she tries to fight the attraction at first.  As time passes, David gets to know Aurora, the soft, vulnerable and unsure side of A.J.'s personality, totally at odds with her prickly agent persona.  No woman has ever made David feel the way A.J. does, and he doesn't know what to do about it.<BR>But A.J. has what she considers a terrible secret burden.  She's inherited her mother's psychic abilities, and even a lifetime of burying them as deep as possible can't close them off.  A.J.'s first and only love rejected her because of her abilities, labelling her a freak, and A.J's terrified that now David knows of her talents, he'll either abandon her or want to dissect her mind.  David's not sure how he feels about A.J.'s gift, but he knows he wants to break through the wall she keeps firmly between them, and show her how he feels about her.  Will David be able to accept A.J. for who she is, and convince her that he means it?  Or will A.J.'s fear of rejection ultimately destroy their love?<br />\\"Going Home\\" is an excellent read, containing three stories that will amuse, entertain, and satisfy the romantic in all of us.

I loved the first book in this series, \\"Blood Price\\", and so was thrilled to discover that the second book was just as good, maybe better.  With three central characters who I have really come to care about and a storyline that gripped me from page one and wouldn't let go, \\"Blood Trail\\" is an immensely entertaining and satisfying read!<br />The series revolves around Private Investigator Vicki Nelson, an ex-policewoman forced to resign from the force because of her failing eyesight.  Vicki is a wonderful heroine, a tough and determined woman who readers can respect, but at the same time she has plenty of vulnerabilities which make her seem all the more real and allow readers to identify with her.  In \\"Blood Trail\\", Vicki's friend, Henry Fitzroy, 450-year-old vampire, romance writer, and bastard son of Henry VIII, comes to her with a plea for help.  Henry's good friends, a large family called the Heerkens, are being murdered one by one, and they can't go to the police for help because they have an amazing secret, they're werewolves!  The two members of the family who have been killed so far were shot at night in their fur-form, which makes it all the more complicated, since Vicki is completely night-blind.  But once Vicki meets two of the younger Heerkens, twins named Rose and Peter, she just can't refuse.  So Henry and Vicki head out of Toronto into the countryside around London, Ontario - Vicki planning to do the day work and Henry the night.<br />But as Vicki begins to investigate, it soon becomes clear that the Heerkens haven't been as careful as they thought.  Someone knows just what they are and is planning to murder them all.  After a close examination of the area, Vicki discovers where the killer did his/her shooting from, but it doesn't bring her any closer to finding out who it is.  And from the location the shots were fired, the killer has to be an Olympic calibre marksman, which doesn't bode well for the wer, who refuse to limit their freedom.<br />And as time goes by, Vicki becomes more and more attached to the Heerkens, and more and more determined to catch the monster who is murdering these good people before anyone else dies.  Huff does an excellent job of portraying the wer society, making it highly similar to that of real wolves.  All of the wers are beautifully portrayed, and Huff makes them seem incredibly real; from Stuart and Nadine, the alpha pair, all the way down to Daniel, the youngest child and an exuberant little cub.  <br />And amidst the mystery and suspense, Vicki's relationship with Henry (the main reason I like these books so much) is developing and growing into something very important to both of them.  It's great watching Vicki and Henry interact, and the character interactions get REALLY interesting as Mike Celluci, Vicki's best friend, former partner, and sometime lover, arrives to find out just what is going on.  Mike, still a cop with the Toronto police, is convinced that Henry is involved in organized crime, and plans to prove it to Vicki.  Of course, when Mike arrives, he has a serious coping failure when he discovers what Vicki has gotten herself involved in, and things get a little crazy.<br />\\"Blood Trail\\" builds in suspense, and as the conclusion gets closer, it becomes harder and harder to put the book down.  I was utterly absorbed in the story and was amazed when I finished and realized I had read the whole book in one day!  Huff has created another winning tale that is sure to please readers everywhere.  Vicki, Henry, and Mike will compel you to read about them, and the wers are just the icing on the cake.  \\"Blood Trail\\" is a fabulous read, containing a perfect blend of mystery, fantasy, and romance.  So don't miss out on the fun and excitement, buy \\"Blood Trail\\" today!	2002-10-09

Add in Henry Fitzroy, a 450-year-old vampire romance writer and bastard son of Henry VIII and Mike Celluci, Vicki's ex-partner on the force and sometime lover, and you have the recipe for a compelling, exciting, and fun story.  Huff has created an intriguing group of main characters and set them in the midst of a suspenseful and well-written mystery.  Sure to please readers of fantasy, mystery, and even romance genres, \\"Blood Price\\" is one great read. <br />Something is stalking the streets of Toronto at night, tearing out throats and draining bodies of blood.  After Vicki discovers the first body in a subway station, she is reunited with Mike Celluci, the primary homicide detective on the case, who she hasn't seen in the eight months since she resigned from the force.  These two can't seem to talk to each other for long without yelling, but underneath all the anger, they still hold a deep affection for one another.<br />Vicki quickly begins to believe that the killer is far from human, but Mike stubbornly refuses to believe in a supernatural possibility.  The media has started crying vampire, which is where Henry Fitzroy comes in.  He has long since learned to survive without killing, and happily co-exists with the 3 million citizens of Toronto.  However, the vampire frenzy the media has created is exactly what Henry doesn't want, for it is more than likely to bring about his demise.<br />Vicki and Henry meet under less than ideal circumstances when Vicki comes across Henry leaning over the newest mutilated body.  In order to convince her he's not the killer, Henry reveals his secret to Vicki, who he immediately feels drawn to.  It's not long before these two team up, and start hunting the killer together.  Henry knows just what it is, a demon, being called into service by an unknown human.  And what's worse is that this lesser demon is the minion of a greater demon, and the killings are writing the name of that greater demon on the city of Toronto.  Once the name is complete, it will open the doorway to Hell on Earth, and the start of Armageddon.<br />And the world's only chance lies in the hands of one vampire, who can't work days, and a night-blind ex-cop.  But Henry and Vicki make a great team, and they aren't about to give up without a fight.  The chemistry Huff develops between Vicki and Henry is electric, and I can't wait to see what develops between them in later books.  Vicki is a wonderful heroine, she's got plenty of vulnerabilities but she's still very tough and very determined.  I adore Henry; he is a refreshingly different kind of vampire, and a fascinating character.  The flashes of his past are expertly handled and really help the reader understand him better.  Mike Celluci is also well drawn, and his interactions with Vicki are often humorous and always interesting.   The story effectively builds to a thrilling climax and Huff provides readers with a satisfying conclusion.<br />\\"Blood Price\\" is a hugely entertaining and tightly plotted book.  The story is filled with suspenseful brushes with death and chilling scenes of undiluted evil, but Huff skilfully blends these with some very funny moments to keep the tone from getting too dark.  \\"Blood Price\\" is just an all-around excellent read, sure to amuse, intrigue, and entertain readers everywhere.  It's a book you don't want to miss and I most definitely recommend it!	2002-10-04

But when Duncan's men come to collect Arianna, it's Duncan's trusted warrior, Lachlan MacLean, who steals Arianna's heart.  And though Arianna has found true love, she knows that once they reach their destination, she will be trapped in a loveless marriage for the rest of her days.  It seems there is no way for Arianna to escape her bleak future and find happiness with Lachlan, but fate might just have something to say about that!<BR>Langan's story isn't the best of the anthology, but it's still an entertaining and enjoyable read.<br />Finally, Marianne Willman's &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; rounds out the book beautifully.

I have some mixed feelings about Anne Rice's \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", but all things considered, I truly believe it is a worthwhile read.  In this follow-up to \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", we are told the life story of Lestat de Lioncourt, and I was bothered by the inconsistencies between the two books.  Lestat tells us that Louis has lied about all kinds of things, and the cruel and cold-hearted villain we came to know and love in \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" becomes a moral, soft-hearted, and tortured soul, always trying to do the right thing and find the answers to life's mysteries.  Hmmm.  I think if I had not read \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", I would have found \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" far more enjoyable, because then I would have been blissfully unaware of the transformation of Lestat's character.  With that said though, \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is a compelling, if lengthy and somewhat verbose, tale, and in the end I was glad I read it, because it has many redeeming qualities.<br />The book purports to be Lestat's autobiography, and we are taken on a lush and erotic journey through Lestat's long and eventful life.  From his youth as the son of a marquis in pre-Revolutionary France when Lestat befriends a troubled violinist named Nicolas, to the crowded streets of Paris where his life is changed forever by a solitary vampire named Magnus, who gives Lestat the dark gift before deserting him forever.  Shocked and amazed by what has befallen him, Lestat, begins to learn what it is to be a vampire.  Questions about the why and how of what he has become torment Lestat, but there is nobody for him to turn to.  Lestat's story has many twists and turns; as he saves his mother from her deathbed with his immortal kiss, meets a hostile coven of Satan-worshipping vampires living under a cemetery, and ultimately goes off on a quest for a legendary ancient vampire named Marius in hopes of finding some answers to the questions that haunt him.  And through it all we are treated to Rice's memorable and moving prose.  However, the author's tendency to become overly descriptive is in evidence here, and there were some portions of the book that were a bit hard to get through.  <br />As I've already stated, my feelings about \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" are a bit ambiguous.  But despite my criticisms of this book, I actually did like it a lot.  Lestat's story is affecting, intriguing, and entertaining, and in the end I could honestly say that I enjoyed it.  Many people adore this book, and it's easy to see why, and on the other hand quite a few people hate it, and I can understand their point of view too.  I can't guarantee anything to anyone picking up this book, because Anne Rice's writing is hypnotic and beautiful to some, and deadly boring to others.  Personally, I would have been sorry if I'd missed \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", since I really did become quite engrossed in Lestat's tale.  So give this book a try and see what you think, you may just be pleasantly surprised!	2002-09-30

The characters we met in \\"Storm Front\\" are back for a second adventure, and in \\"Fool Moon\\" Butcher does an excellent job of fleshing them out into intriguing and well-rounded individuals who become very real in the eyes of the reader.<br />\\"Fool Moon\\" begins six months after the end of \\"Storm Front\\" and Harry Dresden, wizard for hire, is still having trouble paying the bills.  His relationship with his friend and head of Special Investigations in the Chicago PD, Lieutenant Karrin Murphy, is still very strained because of Harry's decision to withhold dangerous information from Murphy on their last big murder case (\\"Storm Front\\"), which resulted in a rather disastrous outcome.  But when vicious and obviously inhuman murders start occurring, Murphy has no choice but to call in Harry for help.  The scenes of the grizzly murders speak for themselves; mauled bodies covered in teeth and claw marks, and enormous wolf-like bloody footprints.  The experts say that the prints are too large to belong to a real wolf, and conclude it must be a hoax. <br />But Harry knows better, and so does Murphy.  They both know they're probably dealing with some rampaging werewolves, but there are all kinds of problems keeping them from solving the crime.  Murphy is already in a precarious position as a result of the questionable goings-on from \\"Storm Front\\", and Internal Investigations is trying to get her to slip up so they can kick her off the force.  In addition, some very nasty and territorial FBI agents are making it hard to even get near the crime scenes, and Murphy doesn't want to make any more enemies than she already has.  <br />So Harry, who suffers from somewhat of a hero complex and feels responsible for Murphy's predicament, is determined to catch the killers and save Murphy's career.  After a consultation with his always-hilarious assistant Bob, an over-sexed air-spirit residing in a human skull, Harry's problems multiply.  It seems that there are all kinds of werewolves; regular werewolves, hexenwolves, loup-garous, and lycanthropes, and Harry has to figure out what exactly he's dealing with so he can figure out how to stop it.<br />The story really takes off from here, and Butcher treats his readers to a wild, brilliantly suspenseful, well-plotted and magical mystery.  The character interactions begin to get really interesting in \\"Fool Moon\\", and Harry's relationship with paranormal reporter Susan becomes much more important.  Mobster \\"Gentleman Johnny Marcone\\" is back again, along with some new characters, including a pack of werewolves who throw in with Harry.  Harry runs into a lot of trouble in \\"Fool Moon\\", and there is plenty of violence in this instalment of the series.  Poor Harry is beaten, shot, attacked, and beaten again, but through it all he continues fighting for what he believes is right.<br />Harry Dresden is a wonderful character who readers can really root for.  He is extremely likable, very unlucky, and has a habit of leaping first and looking much later.  But despite his flaws, Harry is sure to find a place in every reader's heart.  Harry has a wonderful dry wit that makes the story fun to read, and his self-depreciating sense of humour gets a lot of smiles out of me.  Overall, \\"Fool Moon\\" is a highly enjoyable read, and I expect that if you give it a try, you will be pleasantly surprised!	2002-09-27

I was impressed at how well the chapters flowed together, and became totally absorbed in this soap opera-like mystery.  \\"Naked Came the Phoenix\\" is not a serious murder mystery, and it's not supposed to be.  What it is, is an immensely enjoyable tale filled with twists and turns and outlandish characters that was created for a very good cause.<br />The story revolves around Caroline Blessing, a congressman's wife and cellist, who has taken a trip with her very difficult and newly widowed mother, Hilda Finch, to the exclusive Phoenix Spa in Virginia.  Caroline hopes that their time at Phoenix Spa will give her mother and herself a chance to heal after her father's death, and maybe even a chance to bond.  Unfortunately, Caroline's dreams of a relaxing and healing vacation go up in smoke when the spa's owner, Claudia De Vries, is found murdered in one of her own mud baths!<br />Caroline realizes that everyone at the spa is a potential suspect and a potential victim.  The spa's guests include a model-waif and her manager, an aging rock star, a short and stout grey-haired psychic, a dried-up Hollywood producer, and a beautiful and successful actress.  They all have their own hidden connections to Claudia and secrets aplenty.  Not to mention Claudia's own husband, the half-naked pool-boy, and the rest of the spa's staff.  Everyone has something to hide, and these 13 talented authors take us along on a fast-paced and thrilling mystery filled with strange clues, red herrings, blackmail, and incest.  <br />And when more people start turning up dead, the very likable police detective, Vince Toscana, goes into overdrive trying to find the culprit.  Not only is Caroline overwhelmed by what's going on around her, but she also must deal with some crushing news about her supposedly devoted husband Douglas.  Caroline resolves to take her life back into her own hands and find out what's really going on, but there is nothing that can prepare her for the staggering truth behind the murders!<br />\\"Naked Came the Phoenix\\" is an outrageous and exciting murder mystery that is sure to entertain.  I found the first chapter, by Nevada Barr, a bit tough to wade through, but after that every other author was great.  This book is just good clean fun, and if you read it with that in mind, I have no doubt that you will enjoy it enormously.	2002-09-26

A Magical Mystery!	\\"Storm Front\\" by Jim Butcher is the first book in a promising new series that already has me hooked.  Butcher has come up with a fun and entertaining idea, and has crafted likable characters that readers can root for.  Harry Dresden is a wonderful creation and I look forward to many more adventures with him.<br />\\"Storm Front\\" introduces Harry Dresden, the only wizard in the Chicago phone book, who is currently having trouble making ends meet.  You'd think that being the only \\"out\\" wizard in the country would mean Harry was in demand, but unfortunately, people in the 21st century would rather pretend those unsettling things that science can't explain aren't really there.  Then Harry gets what he believes to be a stroke of luck - a woman whose husband has disappeared wants to hire Harry to find him AND his friend Lieutenant Karrin Murphy with Special Investigations in the Chicago PD calls Harry in to consult on a murder case.  Two paying jobs in one day has Harry thinking that things are looking up, but in truth, Harry's trouble is only just beginning.<br />The murder scene Murphy shows to Harry has him feeling distinctly nervous.  Someone very powerful has used Black Magic to murder two people in a violent and horrifying way, and the only way Harry can help Murphy is to figure out the spell the killer used.  Not a good idea when Harry is already under the Doom of Damocles, a kind of magic probation, from the all-powerful White Council, whose job it is to ensure that those who abuse magic are dealt with swiftly and permanently.  Morgan, the White Council representative monitoring Harry, would just love to nail him for messing with Black Magic.<br />And Morgan and the White Council aren't Harry's only problem.  Gentleman Johnny Marcone, Chicago's top mob boss, warns Harry to keep his nose out of this case, which of course Harry can't do.  Especially when he somehow becomes the top suspect in these Black Magic murders.  Now Harry has to get to work fast and find the real wizard who is committing these atrocities, otherwise, Harry's not going to live to see another week!<br />Butcher crafts an original and compelling mystery, and readers will become utterly wrapped up in Harry's dilemma.  In the course of his investigation, Harry runs into all kinds of supernatural beasties, including faeries, demons, vampires, and giant scorpions!  Add in Harry's hilarious assistant, Bob, an air spirit with an overactive libido who lives in a human skull and just a dash of romance and you have the recipe for a wonderful and exciting read.<br />\\"Storm Front\\" is an amazingly good book considering that it is Jim Butcher's first.  I became an instant fan of Butcher while reading this book, and intend to read the rest of the series very soon.  \\"Storm Front\\" contains a suspenseful and well-written mystery, but at the same time, Harry Dresden has a wonderful self-depreciating sense of humour that got quite a few chuckles out of me.  If you enjoy mysteries or fantasy writing of any kind, give \\"Storm Front\\" a try, you'll like it a lot!	2002-09-25

Suspenseful and Fun!	\\"Hard Eight\\" by Janet Evanovich is the latest instalment in the fantastic Stephanie Plum series, and it is well worth the hardcover price!  Evanovich leads Stephanie, our favourite bumbling bounty hunter, on a dark and dangerous adventure that had me utterly captivated the whole way through.  \\"Hard Eight\\" is certainly one of the darkest books in this series, but not to worry, the laugh-out-loud humour that we have come to expect from a Stephanie Plum novel is there too!<br />In this eighth instalment of the series, Stephanie gets a request that is really not in her field of work.  It seems that Evelyn Soder and her young daughter Annie have gone on the run, leaving behind a hostile and very angry ex-husband who's about to invoke the child-custody bond on Annie and cause Evelyn's grandmother (Stephanie's parents' next-door-neighbour) Mabel Markowitz, to lose her home.  So as a favour to Mabel, Stephanie agrees to look into things and try to find Evelyn and Annie.<br />But it soon becomes evident that this is a really nasty situation, nastier than anything that Stephanie has been up against before.  Eddie Abruzzi, a very shady and scary local businessman and Evelyn's landlord, threatens Stephanie to give up her search for Evelyn immediately when she has a run-in with him while checking out Evelyn's home.  But why would Abruzzi care if Stephanie finds Evelyn?  Abruzzi's reaction has Stephanie very suspicious, and when she refuses to drop this case, Abruzzi declares war on her.  Hunh??<br />It seems to Stephanie that Abruzzi is more than a little nutty, but when someone leaves a bag of snakes on her doorknob, tarantulas in her car, and a dead body is left on her couch she realizes she is in serious trouble.  So, it is time to get some help, and the best person for the job is her mentor Ranger, who Stephanie already owes too many favours.  At the end of \\"Seven Up\\" readers were left wondering what would happen between Stephanie and Ranger, and in \\"Hard Eight\\" things between these two really heat up.  But Joe Morelli, Stephanie's ex-fiancé, isn't entirely out of the picture, and he ends up getting involved in this case too. <br />But Ranger and Morelli aren't the only ones trying to help Steph.  Evelyn's correspondence school lawyer, the annoying yet lovable Albert Kloughn, has latched himself onto Stephanie and just won't go away.  We get to know Stephanie's sister Valerie much better in this book, and Grandma Mazur is hilarious as usual with her utterly inappropriate comments and her unique attitude towards life in general.  Lula, the 200+lb ex-hooker is along for the ride too, and she always manages to make me laugh.  It is always a pleasure to read a Stephanie Plum novel, and spend time with Evanovich's hysterically funny, eccentric, and perhaps most important, likable characters.  No one wants to read about people they don't like, and Evanovich has created a wonderful cast of characters who readers can root for and relate to as they follow them through their adventures.<br />\\"Hard Eight\\" is a great read, and I loved every minute of it.  As Stephanie gets more and more caught up in the terrifying games Abruzzi is playing with her, while still following the trail that leads to Evelyn and Annie, the suspense builds very effectively.  The climax of this book had me quite literally on the edge of my seat, and I was so absorbed in it I wouldn't have put the book down for love nor money!  But Evanovich expertly balances the darkness in this book with plenty of light moments, and the result is one highly compelling and all-around fabulous read.  \\"Hard Eight\\" is a book that you really don't want to miss, and I highly recommend it!	2002-09-24

Filled with the eccentric and quirky cast of characters we have grown to know and love over the last six books, \\"Seven Up\\" provides another wonderful dose of the world of bounty hunter Stephanie Plum.<br />In this seventh instalment, Stephanie is given a seemingly simple FTA (failure to appear) to pick up.  Eddie DeChooch, an aging and nearly blind mobster, missed his court date after getting busted smuggling cigarettes.  It shouldn't be too hard to pick up an old man, but Stephanie soon finds out that Eddie DeChooch still has a few tricks up his sleeve, after several attempts to bring him in fail.<br />Stephanie's life, which was left hanging in the balance at the end of \\"Hot Six\\", is hugely complicated by a sort-of engagement to her sexy cop boyfriend Joe Morelli and a growing attraction to fellow bounty hunter and mentor Ranger.  Not only is Stephanie confused about the two men in her life, she's also being trailed by two of Choochy's elderly friends, who keep breaking into her apartment.  Not to mention Stephanie's spaced out, pothead friends from high school, the lovable Mooner and Dougie, who keep showing up at odd times and letting themselves in.  And then Steph's perfect sister Valerie suddenly arrives from California with her two daughters and the astonishing news that her perfect marriage is over.<br />With so many things going on in her life, Stephanie isn't having much luck finding Eddie DeChooch, who is driving around in a big white Cadillac and should be simple to find.  Things start to get fun, however, when yet another of Steph's cars is destroyed, and she and her sidekick, the 200+lb ex-hooker Lula, end up riding around on a Harley!  But Stephanie's interviews with horny nephews and mud-wrestlers get her nowhere, so she goes to Ranger for help.  And sure Ranger will help, but only if Stephanie agrees to spend a nightwith him.  Oh boy!  Not the kind of thing a sort-of-engaged girl should agree to.<br />Grandma Mazur is in top form in \\"Seven Up\\"; full of gossip from Stiva's funeral parlor and getting involved in all kinds of bizarre and hilarious situations.  But things start going bad fast when one after another of Stephanie's friends start disappearing, and it becomes clear that there's a lot more going on than cigarette smuggling.  So it's up to Stephanie to solve the mystery, find her missing friends and save the day, and if she wants Ranger's help, she's all too aware of the price she'll have to pay.<br />Well what can I say about \\"Seven Up\\" except for what fun!  This book is filled with all the wackiness and excitement we have come to expect from a Stephanie Plum novel.  \\"Seven Up\\" is another uproariously funny adventure that kept me laughing the whole way through and sent me straight out to the bookstore to buy \\"Hard Eight\\" when I was done.  \\"Seven Up\\" is another excellent read in this fabulous series and I recommend it without reservation.	2002-09-22

After six books in the series, Evanovich shows no signs that this series is getting stale, providing readers with another fast-paced and exciting read.  Trenton New Jersey's most incompetent bounty hunter, Stephanie Plum herself, is back and better than ever, ready to once again sweep readers up into her immensely entertaining life.<br />In this sixth instalment, Stephanie is faced with something she never expected to happen.  When Homer Ramos, the son of black-market arms dealer Alexander Ramos, is found shot in his father's fire-gutted office building, the only person on the security cameras with Homer is Stephanie's fellow bounty hunter Ranger.  But Ranger has disappeared, and he missed a court date in the process, so Vinnie asks Stephanie to find Ranger and bring him in.  Well not only is Ranger a former mercenary who won't be found if he doesn't want to be, he's also Stephanie's mentor and friend and Stephanie will have nothing to do with trying to catch him.<br />But of course Stephanie's bound to get involved one way or another, and when Ranger starts making late night visits to her apartment, she soon finds herself doing rather disastrous surveillance on the Ramos family and getting closer and closer to the wrong side of the law!<br />Stephanie's problems start piling up, and though she thinks her life is a disaster, we get an uproariously funny and suspenseful read as we watch Stephanie get herself into one mess after another.  Grandma Mazur has moved into Stephanie's apartment after having a big blow-up with Steph's father, which is utterly ruining Stephanie's sex life with her sexy cop boyfriend Joe Morelli.  Grandma Mazur is just as eccentric and amusing as ever, providing great comic relief.  Lula, the 230lb ex-hooker is along for the ride too, and she always manages to make me laugh.  Not to mention Bob, the hilarious golden retriever with an eating disorder who bounds into Stephanie's life one day and doesn't want to leave.<br />But things quickly turn serious, and Stephanie finds herself being tailed everywhere she goes by two goons who are expecting Stephanie to lead them to Ranger.  And if she doesn't, they promise Stephanie that very bad things are going to happen to her.  An FTA wanted for murdering his wife gets given to Stephanie since Ranger is out of the picture, and he is no walk in the park to deal with.  And it's not long before Stephanie is once again surrounded by corpses, wrecked cars, and terrifying threats.  She's got the zit from hell, she's worried about herself and Ranger, and she is totally sexually frustrated.  Tough for Stephanie, but tons of fun for readers!<br />\\"Hot Six\\" contains an intriguing and well thought out mystery, and Evanovich provides her readers with a conclusion that will satisfy, but at the same time leave readers begging for \\"Seven Up\\".  Evanovich has a great sense of humour, and she knows just how and where to use it to make us laugh.  She also has a gift for blending a tight and suspenseful mystery with the humour that she does so well into one fabulous creation that works beautifully.  \\"Hot Six\\" is a fantastic read and it comes very highly recommended.	2002-09-20

This fifth instalment in the uproariously funny Stephanie Plum series may just be the best yet.  A well-written and suspenseful mystery is blended perfectly with Stephanie's hilarious misadventures to create an all-around wonderful read.<br />\\"High Five\\" begins with Stephanie, Trenton's \\"bombshell bounty hunter\\", in the midst of a financial depression.  She is not making nearly enough money picking up FTA's to make rent and she needs to find a solution fast.  It's not a whole lot of use to Stephanie when her family enlists her help to find her missing Uncle Fred the cheapskate, because there's no bond money involved when and if she does find him.  But family duties cannot be ignored, so Stephanie sets to work trying to find out what happened to Uncle Fred, and why he disappeared on his way to the garbage company to settle a dispute over $2.  Right at the start her investigation, Stephanie comes across some disturbing photos of body parts in garbage bags found in Uncle Fred's desk, which makes it clear that Fred had become involved in something very nasty.<br />But searching for Uncle Fred won't pay Stephanie's rent and when she turns to her mentor and fellow bounty hunter Ranger for help, he hires her as part of Rangeman Enterprises.  This leads Stephanie to a string of disastrous and dangerous jobs of dubious legal validity that will have readers laughing out loud.  Add to that a very small FTA named Randy Briggs who wants nothing to do with being brought back into the system and you have the recipe for a hilarious read.<br />But \\"High Five\\" has a dark edge to it as well.  Benito Ramirez, the sociopathic boxer with a penchant for mutilating women who stalked Stephanie in \\"One for the Money\\", is out of jail and back to harassing poor Stephanie, who is justifiably terrified.  On top of that, a series of mysterious murders all related to Uncle Fred's garbage company and a bomb planted on Stephanie's car,lead Stephanie to the conclusion that she is in the middle of something very serious, and that someone besides Ramirez wants her dead.  Evanovich skilfully builds the suspense, and readers will be swept along with the intriguing mystery to a satisfying conclusion.<br />All the characters we have grown to know and love throughout the series are back and better than ever in \\"High Five\\".  Gun-toting Grandma Mazur and 200+ lb ex-hooker Lula are guaranteed to keep readers laughing, while the sexual tension between Stephanie and the two men in her life, sexy vice cop Joe Morelli and enigmatic bounty hunter Ranger, is sure to tantalize and fascinate readers.<br />You just cannot miss with \\"High Five\\".  Evanovich has crafted an enticing and exciting tale that will keep readers captivated and will leave them begging for more.  It is downright impossible to dislike the intrepid Stephanie Plum, whose unique, sassy, and witty point of view makes this series so great.  \\"High Five\\" comes very highly recommended.	2002-09-15

Stephanie Plum, our favourite bumbling bounty hunter is back again, with the usual cast of eccentric and comical characters plus a few new faces you're going to love!<br />This time, Stephanie is after first time offender Maxine Nowicki, who missed her court date on an auto theft charge initiated by her boyfriend, and now needs to be found and brought back into the system.  Sounds simple, right?  Only nothing is ever simple for Stephanie Plum, which is why she's so much fun to read about.<br />While going through the rounds, talking to the friends and family of Maxine Nowicki, Stephanie is hired by Maxine's ex-boyfriend Eddie Kuntz, who wants Stephanie to find Maxine so he can get back something of his that Maxine has, and he claims that something is love letters.  Hmmm.  But Maxine is having some fun with Eddie in her quest for revenge against him.  She knows how bad Eddie wants what she has, and she's sending him on the treasure hunt from hell.  And the thing is, Maxine's clues are in a code that Stephanie can't decipher.  So that's how we meet Sally Sweet, a 7 foot tall (with his heels that is), very hairy transvestite, who joins Steph's team as the clue decoder.  Sally is a hilarious and very welcome addition to the already colourful cast of characters. And Sally brings with him his neurotic roommate Sugar, a fellow transvestite who tries to bake all his troubles away.<br />But as we all know, nothing ever goes smoothly for Stephanie Plum.  Not only is she not doing so great in her search for Maxine, she is also now competing with her archenemy Joyce Barnhardt, who cousin Vinnie hired as a part time bounty hunter and who is out to catch Maxine as well.  Stephanie and Joyce have hated each other for years, but Stephanie's dislike of Joyce reached an all time high when she caught Joyce and her now ex-husband playing hide the salamitogether on her dining room table.<br />But Stephanie isn't the kind of woman who gives up when things get tough, and she continues with her search for Maxine.  And it isn't too long before she finds herself caught up in the middle of something very ugly.  Stephanie has to deal with chopped off fingers, mysterious murders, counterfeiters, a blown up car and firebombs, one of which lands right in Stephanie's apartment.  It seems that someone wants to get rid of Stephanie permanently, and she better be careful if she doesn't want them to succeed.<br />So with the help of ultra sexy vice cop Joe Morelli, 200+ lb ex-hooker Lula, and gun toting Grandma Mazur, Stephanie sets about getting to the bottom of this mystery.  Things really heat up between Stephanie and Morelli in this instalment, much to my delight!  And alongside the suspenseful mystery is the ever-present humour and witty repartee that makes this series so much fun to read.  <br />\\"Four to Score\\" is another winning entry in an already great series.  Evanovich blends the mystery with the comedy brilliantly, and the result is a downright wonderful read.  I am utterly hooked on Stephanie Plum, and am extremely grateful I found her.

Our favourite inept bounty hunter, Ms. Plum herself, is back in action, surrounded by all of the eccentric and quirky characters from Trenton, New Jersey that we have grown to know and love.  Fast-paced and full of laughs, \\"Three to get Deadly\\" is a book you don't want to miss.<br />Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter extraordinaire, is on a new case that she really doesn't want to have.  Usually her FTAs (failure to appears) are not the finest society has to offer and nobody minds Stephanie hunting them down.  Unfortunately, this time Stephanie is looking for Moses \\"Uncle Mo\\" Bedemier, Trenton's favourite citizen and their beloved neighbourhood candy store owner.  It seems strange to Stephanie that Uncle Mo jumped bail on the minor charge of carrying concealed, which would more than likely only have gotten him a slap on the wrist.  Despite the hostility she's generating searching for Uncle Mo, Stephanie sticks with it, though it isn't easy to get even a single lead with all of Trenton banding together to protect Mo.<br />But Stephanie has an uncanny knack for walking right into the middle of things, and while taking a unauthorized tour of Uncle Mo's candy store, Stephanie gets knocked out and wakes up next to a dead man.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that there's something more going on here than a concealed weapon charge, and as local drug dealers start turning up dead all over the place, it leads Stephanie to believe that good old Uncle Mo has become an anti-drug vigilante.  <br />The mystery in this book is top-notch, and it is blended perfectly with the laugh out loud humour that is so prevalent in this instalment.  With Lula, the 230lb ex-hooker as Stephanie's sidekick, gun-toting Grandma Mazur always wanting to help out, and dangerously sexy vice cop Joe Morelli never far away, this book is downright hilarious, not to mention filled with sexual tension.  But when terrifying men dressed in ski masks and coveralls start threatening Stephanie and her hamster, Stephanie realizes her life is once again in serious danger.  And so, with a little help from mysterious and sexy fellow bounty hunter Ranger, it's up to Stephanie and her motley crew of bounty hunters in training to catch Uncle Mo and these masked men before Stephanie catches a bullet in the head.<br />\\"Three to get Deadly\\" is another great read in a truly wonderful series.  Evanovich has a fabulous dry wit and impeccable comedic timing, which combine to make one really funny book.  Stephanie Plum is so likable and so much fun to spend time with that I have read the first four books in this series in less than a week.  Evanovich has created a marvellous character in Stephanie Plum; she's the kind of person you'd like for a friend and she makes this series what it is.  \\"Three to get Deadly\\" is a fun-filled and suspenseful read and it comes highly recommended!	2002-09-10

Tons of Fun!	\\"Two for the Dough\\" is the second instalment in Janet Evanovich's delightful Stephanie Plum series.  An intriguing and suspenseful mystery is seamlessly blended with laugh-out-loud humour, to create one great read!<br />Stephanie Plum, possibly the most inept bounty hunter ever to hit the streets, is on a new case, now armed with a stun gun, pepper spray, and her .38 Smith & Wesson (of which she is terrified).  Stephanie is looking for bail jumper Kenny Mancuso who just shot his best friend.  Kenny is from the same neighbourhood as Stephanie, Trenton's burg.  He is fresh out of the army and he seems to have recently come into a lot of money.  Very suspicious.<br />With a little help from Ranger, Stephanie's mentor and fellow bounty hunter, Stephanie sets about finding her newest FTA.  Of course, well meaning help comes from several directions.  Stephanie's Grandma Mazur, whose favourite pastime is heading to a viewing of Trenton's latest deceased, comes in handy when Stephanie's search requires she check out all the local funeral parlours.  Grandma Mazur provides great cover, but she is also absolutely hilarious as she causes all kinds of bizarre corpse related accidents.  And vice cop Joe Morelli and his overactive libido are never far from Stephanie's side.  With Stephanie's blind luck and Morelli's honed cop instincts, these two make a pretty good team.  However their personal relationship is a whole other story, usually consisting of intense but terribly incomplete sexual episodes followed by confusion, distrust, teasing, and denial.  The relationship between Stephanie and Morelli is always fascinating and never predictable.<br />But as we laugh our way through Stephanie's various misadventures, we are also kept riveted by a thrilling and fast-paced mystery.  Stephanie, for all her mistakes, has good instincts, which lead her right into the middle of a very perilous situation.  Stephanie finds herself knee-deep in corpses, caskets, and stolen military firearms.And things really get scary when she starts receiving embalmed body parts in the mail.  If Stephanie doesn't watch out, the frightening threats she's been receiving could easily turn into reality!<br />Evanovich skilfully crafts her well-thought-out mystery, tying all of the threads together in an exciting and satisfying conclusion.

Read this Book!	\\"One for the Money\\" by Janet Evanovich introduces Stephanie Plum, a wonderfully quirky, down on her luck Jersey girl who readers are guaranteed to love.  I have the Amazon recommendations to thank for introducing me to Stephanie Plum, and I am eternally grateful!  Evanovich skilfully blends the humour, mystery, suspense, and a dash of romance into one of the wittiest, funniest, and most compelling books I've read in a long time.<br />Stephanie Plum has lost her job as a discount lingerie buyer and if she doesn't make some money soon, she's going to be in serious trouble.  She's already had her car repossessed, has had to sell almost all her furniture and appliances, and she just drank her last bottle of beer for breakfast.  So what's the answer?  Meet Cousin Vinnie, bail bondsman.  Though the filing job Stephanie was thinking of has already been filled, the job of apprehending FTAs (failure to appears) for $$$ a pop is far more appealing anyway.  After blackmailing cousin Vinnie into giving her the job, Stephanie gets down to some serious bounty hunter business.<br />The thing is, the FTA she's after is Joe Morelli, a Vice cop charged with Murder One for shooting an unarmed man.  But Stephanie and Morelli go way back, coming from the same neighbourhood in Trenton.  In high school, Morelli was irresistible to all the girls, including Stephanie.  He took Stephanie's virginity while she was closing up at Tasty Pastry when he charmed the pants off of her behind the éclair case, and then he never called her again.<br />So, Stephanie is determined to get her man, the only problem is she doesn't have a clue what she's doing.  A couple of quick lessons from fellow bounty hunter Ranger just aren't enough to turn Stephanie into a pro, but she is nothing if not persistent.  It is a hoot watching Stephanie bumble through her work, and Evanovich's perfect timing and dry wit make for many laugh out loud scenes.<br />Unfortunately, Stephanie has a bad habit of leaping first and looking later, and it seems that she has leapt right into a very dangerous situation.  In addition to the terrifying threats coming from an unknown source, Stephanie ends up with a sociopathic boxer with a penchant for mutilating women after her.  So if Stephanie doesn't watch out, her career as a bounty hunter, and her life, may be cut painfully short!<br />The mystery and the suspense are expertly rendered and they fit seamlessly with the lighter scenes in the book.  Evanovich has created a wonderful and colourful cast of characters, one of the best being Stephanie's Grandma Mazur.  But it's Stephanie who keeps us reading and it's Stephanie who readers are rooting for.  Evanovich has created a perfectly down to earth, realistic, and likable character in Stephanie, and female readers will really be able to relate to her.  <br />\\"One for the Money\\" is an all-around fantastic read, and it left me craving much more of Stephanie Plum.  It is darn near impossible to read this book and not have a great time, so buy \\"One for the Money\\" today.  A word of advice though, have the next few books in the series (\\"Two for the Dough\\" at least) readily available when you finish reading \\"One for the Money\\", because believe me, you are not going to want to wait to read more about the irresistible Stephanie Plum!	2002-09-04

Robb's addictive In Death series and it is fantastic.  All of our favourite characters are back in full force in this utterly riveting read that kept me turning pages into the wee hours of the morning.  Robb's prose flows like water throughout the entire book, and her innovative and exciting plot is sure to keep readers totally engrossed.<br />Tough-as-nails Lieutenant Eve Dallas is one of the top cops in the NYPSD.  In the hot and sweaty days of July 2059, tempers are flaring all over the city, and keeping the police busy.  Louie Cogburn has spent three days holed up in his apartment, and when a neighbour knocks at his door, he picks up his baseball bat and starts swinging.  The first cop on scene kills Louie with a simple stun that shouldn't have caused termination, and Eve knows that something isn't right.  The only clue is a strange message left on Louie's computer screen \\"ABSOLUTE PURITY ACHIEVED\\".  And when a second man dies under very similar circumstances it leads Eve to a vigilante terrorist group and the terrifying conclusion that she is dealing with a virus capable of spreading from computer to man!<br />Along with Robb's intriguing mystery is the ever-evolving relationship between Eve and her sexy billionaire husband Roarke.  These two are one of my favourite couples of all time, and in this book Robb does a brilliant job of reminding me why I love them so much.  The dynamics of Eve and Roarke's relationship are always interesting and it amazes me that after 15 books I still find them so fresh and intriguing.  Eve and Roarke's romance is very real, filled with red-hot passion that will steam up your windows and poignant tenderness that will touch your heart.<br />In \\"Purity in Death\\", Robb brings in a number of characters from previous books, and for me, a dedicated fan of the series, this was a real bonus.  First time readers may find it a bit tough to follow all of the characters without knowing the history that goes along with them, though Robb does provide all the essential background information.  Even if you haven't met any of the characters before, I guarantee it won't take long to get to know them and love them.  Indeed, I believe that long-time fans and first time readers alike will be thrilled with Robb's latest effort.  <br />\\"Purity in Death\\" is yet another winner that Robb can add to her list.  I was completely captivated from start to finish by the story and by the characters I have come to know and love.  Robb has a true gift for making the characters she creates come alive for her readers and it's hard to believe that Eve, Roarke, Peabody, Feeney, McNab and all the others aren't real people.  \\"Purity in Death\\" is a first rate mystery filled with romance, suspense, and all the fascinating futuristic gadgets from 2059.  You do not want to miss out on Robb's latest triumph so buy this book today and enjoy!	2002-08-28
US	43021965	ROFNY90W8GDC5	0345337662	494921316	Interview with the Vampire	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Darkly Delightful Tale!	\\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is the book that started it all, the first instalment in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles.  Having seen the movie first, I wasn't sure how much I would get out of this book.  I decided to give it a try and found that it was indeed worth my while.  The story is compelling and the characters are well drawn, so that Rice's lengthy descriptions and occasional slow passages are worth the work it takes to get through them in order to enjoy this darkly seductive tale.<br />Louis became a vampire in the year 1791.  His early years were spent on his family's plantation in New Orleans, until he met the vampire Lestat and underwent his metamorphosis.  Louis' first years as a vampire were filled with anguish and torment as he tried to fight his very nature, which insisted that he must kill to survive.  Louis quickly grew to resent his maker, Lestat, who seemed cold and utterly heartless in Louis' eyes.  Louis struggled terribly with questions about the why and the how of what he had become, with no one to guide him or give him answers. <BR> <BR>And as Louis' contempt for Lestat grew, Lestat created a child vampire named Claudia to keep Louis from leaving him.  Claudia quickly captured Louis' heart and the two of them became inseparable.  But as the years passed, Claudia began to see her tiny body as a prison from which she would never escape.  Her discontent continued to increase, and she yearned to be free of Lestat to discover the world with Louis.  Claudia is a fabulous character, and Rice does an amazing job of portraying this woman trapped in the body of a child.  In my opinion, Claudia is one of the best characters in this book.<br />I don't want to give the rest of the story away to those who are not familiar with it, but Louis continues to search for answers about why vampires exist and his quest takes him far from New Orleans to search for other vampires in the Old World.  Louis' tale is filled with heart-pounding danger, sensuous encounters,exotic new vampires, and heart-rending sorrow.  We as readers become completely caught up in Louis' triumphs and failures, and are swept into the dark and seductive world of these remarkable vampires.<br />I found \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" highly entertaining and full of wonderful surprises that weren't even hinted at in the movie.  As I stated before, some of Rice's passages can become a little tough to wade through, but on the whole this book will capture your imagination and leave you looking at vampires in a whole new light.  I imagine Anne Rice's style just isn't for everyone, but \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is a great book in which to sample Rice's writing.  So give this book a try, you may find it's just what you've been looking for.	2002-08-27

Though the plot seems a bit stretched and quite improbable at times, I still found \\"The Second Summoning\\" to be a hugely entertaining and fun read that I would have been sorry to have missed.<br />Claire Hansen is a Keeper, whose life is dedicated to sealing holes in the fabric of the universe where evil is trying to escape.  As the story begins Claire is traveling with her very old and very opinionated talking cat, Austin, and Dean, a Bystander she met in her first adventure.  And though Dean really shouldn't be allowed to know that Keepers even exist, a brief and utterly disastrous separation proves that Claire is a danger to herself and the universe when Dean isn't around.<br />But when Claire and Dean reunite after their miserable weeks of separation, they come together with such enthusiasm and passion that they create an excess of positive feelings in the world.  Now this would usually be just fine, except that Claire's younger sister Diana, a fellow Keeper, had recently created a huge happiness amplifying snowflake for her school's Christmas dance, which turned Claire and Dean's happiness into a giant bubble of goodness.  This bubble then fell under the influence of Diana's friend Lena, who was at that moment trying to manifest an angel in her bedroom.  And guess what?  She succeeded.<br />However, something went terribly wrong, and though everyone knows that angels are sexless, Lena's angel appeared with a very impressive, fully functional male's body, complete with raging teenage hormones.  And as if trying to deal with the angel wasn't enough, the laws of the universe dictate that for every flow of wonderful goodness that enters the world there must be an equal and opposite flow of evil to balance it out.  So, in a backwoods area of rural Canada, a demon, fully endowed with the attributes of a normal teenagegirl, materializes.  (See what I mean about the plot being a little out there?)<br />Anyway, both the demon and the angel are thrown completely off balance by the unfamiliar feelings and emotions their new bodies are capable of.  And soon downtown Toronto is thrown into turmoil by an angel who wants to help but isn't very good at it and a demon who wants to cause as much havoc as possible, but isn't sure how.<br />So, it's up to Claire and Diana to solve this problem, and get the demon back to Hell and the angel back to Heaven.  Unfortunately, Diana is opposed to Claire's planned method of dealing with this problem, which makes for some serious complications.  <br />\\"The Second Summoning\\" is an action-packed, fun-filled romp through an enchanting fantasy world, and you don't want to miss it.  Austin is as amusing and witty as he was in the first book, giving readers a hilarious running commentary.  With compelling and lovable characters and a storyline that will keep you on your toes, this book comes highly recommended.	2002-08-19

Huff has created a fascinating fantasy world that sets the stage for this delightful tale of supernatural excitement and otherworldly romance. <br />Claire Hansen is a Keeper, which basically means that her life is devoted to travelling from place to place sealing leaks in the fabric of the universe where evil is trying to escape.  As the book begins, Claire receives a summons, which leads her to the Elysian Fields Guest House, a run-down old B&B run by an unpleasant little man.  Claire and her very opinionated, far from young talking cat, Austin, rent a room for the night, and the next morning Claire is shocked to discover that she is the new owner of the B&B.<br />But it's not just any old B&B that Claire has inherited.  The Elysian Fields Guest House comes complete with a hole to Hell in the furnace room and a very, very evil and very, very dusty Keeper who's been sleeping in Room 6 for decades.  In addition to these supernatural extras Claire also has to deal with her new employee, the gorgeous yet innocent caretaker/cook/handyman/Newfie, Dean McIssac.  With her hormones already in overdrive, Claire soon finds out she also has to contend with Jacques Labaet, a lusty French-Canadian ghost who wants to be the man in Claire's life.<br />While trying to figure out how to close the hole to Hell, Claire finds herself renovating the B&B, dealing with her infrequent but always exciting guests (I liked the retired Olympians best), and figuring out what on earth she should do about her undeniable attraction to two men, one who is far too young and the other who is far too dead.<br />Of course Austin, when not telling someone to \\"feed the cat\\", always has some commentary to make about Claire's life and the situations she gets into.  Indeed, Austin has some of the best lines in the book, which more often than not had me laughing out loud.<br />But the precarious balance keeping all Hell from breaking loose (quite literally) is put in jeopardy when Claire's younger sister Diana, a fellow Keeper with far more power than sense, arrives at the B&B to help out.  Disasters seem to follow Diana wherever she goes, and the very thought of Diana in the same house as Hell strikes fear into Claire's heart.  But Diana is there to stay until the problem is resolved, and she manages to start a chain reaction that makes for some fantastic reading and an explosive conclusion!<br />\\"Summon the Keeper\\" is, quite simply, a great book.  Each and every character was vivid and intriguing, and I found myself completely caught up in the adventures of Claire, Austin, Dean and Jacques.  You do not want to miss out on this hugely entertaining read, so buy \\"Summon the Keeper\\" today.  I promise you will not regret it!	2002-08-13

When I decided to read &quot;The Ivy Tree&quot; by Mary Stewart, I was hoping for an engrossing mystery that would keep me captivated.  Unfortunately, this book just never managed to grip me, and I found myself struggling to finish it.  I'm aware that my opinion is in the minority here, so I guess it comes down to the fact that Mary Stewart's writing just isn't my cup of tea.<br />The story revolves around Mary Grey, a woman who has recently come to England from Canada, and who looks amazingly similar to glamorous missing heiress Annabel Winslow.  &quot;The Ivy Tree&quot; starts out with a great first chapter as Conor, a distant relation of Annabel's who now runs the farm at Whitescar, verbally attacks Mary believing her to be Annabel.  But once the misunderstanding is straightened out, Conor begins to see what an asset Mary could be.  <br />Conor is convinced that Annabel's ailing grandfather is not planning to leave him any part of Whitescar when he dies despite all the long years that Conor has worked there.  So, he hires Mary Grey to come back claiming that she's Annabel, so that she will receive most of Whitescar in the old man's will and then can give it to Conor.  The only thing that could present a problem is Annabel's cousin Julie, who will almost certainly be in the will as well, but Conor is confident that she won't get in the way.  After convincing a reluctant Mary to go along with his scheme, they put their plan in motion.<br />But things don't run as smoothly as they should.  Tensions run high at Whitescar when Julie arrives for a visit.  Conor begins to show a violent and unsettling side to himself that makes Mary wonder what kind of man he really is.  And Mary herself is hiding a shocking secret that could put her in serious danger if anyone, especially Conor, were to find out!<br />The ending of &quot;The Ivy Tree&quot; really picks up, but for me, the majority of the book just dragged on and on without enough action to keep me genuinely interested.Though the quality of writing is good and the characters are well developed, this story just didn't hold my attention.  But even though I found this book a bit hard to get through, I did still enjoy it, and I would recommend you form an opinion on &quot;The Ivy Tree&quot; for yourself.	2002-08-09

I am eternally grateful to Silhouette for re-printing Nora's older, out-of-print books so that I can have the pleasure of reading them all these years later!<br />&quot;Second Nature&quot; tells the story of Lee Radcliffe, a highly successful reporter for Celebrity magazine.  Lee is determined to get an exclusive interview with notoriously reclusive Hunter Brown, highly acclaimed author of horror fiction and one of the nation's most popular authors.  When Lee gets a tip that Hunter will be speaking at a small writer's conference, she jumps on the opportunity and signs herself up.  But when Lee finally gets to meet Hunter, he isn't at all what she expected.  He has the most intense and unnerving eyes that seem to see right into her most private thoughts and he is dangerously handsome.  <BR>Hunter is intrigued by the stunningly beautiful Lee, who wears a thin coat of confidence over an excess of ever-present nervous energy.  Hunter decides to agree to the interview on one condition, that Lee must join him on a two-week camping trip in Arizona's Oak Creek Canyon.  Not one to let a little adversity keep her from her goal, Lee agrees and her journey with Hunter begins.<BR>But as time goes by, Lee finds it harder and harder to deny her intense attraction to Hunter.  Not only that, but as she learns more and more about Hunter, she begins to fall for the complex, intelligent, sensitive, and passionate man he keeps hidden from almost everyone.  Lee and Hunter inevitably become lovers, and their romance will surely entice and satisfy readers.  It's not long before Hunter realizes he has fallen irrevocably in love with Lee.  But when Hunter asks Lee to spend her life with him, she is overcome by doubts about leaving her work in L.A. and taking a step into the unknown.  So Lee pushes Hunter away and returns to the life she knows.  <BR>Will Lee sentence both herself and Hunter to a life of loneliness and longing because of her fear of failure?  Or will she follow her heart, take the risk and find a lifetime of love and happiness in Hunter's arms?<BR>&quot;Second Nature&quot; is a wonderful tale filled with fascinating characters and breathtaking descriptions that make you feel as if you are right there alongside Hunter and Lee!<br />Though I really enjoyed &quot;Second Nature&quot;, &quot;One Summer&quot; was my favourite of the two.  Lee's good friend, Bryan Mitchell started her career as a photographer for Celebrity magazine, but has now turned to freelance work.  When offered the opportunity to travel across the country and create a photo essay on summer in America, for Life-style magazine, Bryan is thrilled with the prospect.  The only problem is she has to take on a partner if she wants the assignment, brooding and cynical photojournalist Shade Colby.  <BR>Shade isn't too pleased with having to take on a partner either, being a man who is happiest working alone.  But because the assignment is so appealing, they both grudgingly agree to work together.  <BR>Unfortunately, Shade and Bryan have trouble agreeing on anything, and as they start their journey each grates on the other's nerves.  But as time and states go by, Shade starts to appreciate Bryan's innate goodness and warmth, and learns to admire, if not agree with, her ability to look at only the positive side of life.  Shade finds it harder and harder to control the raging desire he feels for Bryan and eventually he and Bryan can't deny their feelings any longer.  Shade and Bryan's romance is filled with tenderness and affection as well as red-hot passion.<BR>Though Bryan and Shade are both deeply in love with one another, neither of them seems capable of sharing those feelings.  As the end of summer draws closer and closer, Bryan feels her heart break a little at the thought of losing Shade.  Intending to make it easier on both of them, Bryan plans to fly home immediately once the assignment is done.  <BR>But will Bryan follow through with her plan and never let Shade know how she really feels about him?  Or will fate intervene and give Shade the strength to show Bryan what's really in his heart?<BR>&quot;One Summer&quot; is an undeniably great read.  I loved both Bryan and Shade, and I found the storyline utterly absorbing.  I was truly sad to see this story come to an end.<br />In short, &quot;Summer Pleasures&quot; is a perfect summer read that will give readers several hours of pure enjoyment.  This re-print is well worth your time and money, so buy &quot;Summer Pleasures&quot; today and get ready for some hot and satisfying summer romance!	2002-08-07

I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy, but \\"Secret of the Wolf\\" is something really special.  Krinard has created an amazingly insightful, touching, and thought-provoking novel that I could not put down (I was even reading it at stoplights in my car!).<br />Amidst the lush vineyards and rolling hills of the picturesque Napa Valley is Dr. Johanna Schell's Der Haven, a place where those who know the pain of being different can come to live in peace.  Well ahead of her time, Johanna uses hypnotism as one of her main tools to treat her patients' mental illnesses.  The patients at Der Haven are a diverse bunch: Lewis, the obsessive compulsive former Reverend, Harper, the catatonic ex-soldier, Irene, a middle-aged ex-theatre actress who thinks she's still a star, May, an incredibly shy and nervous young girl who rarely shows her face, and Oscar, whose mind will forever be child-like.  Krinard paints all of these characters with compassion and realism, and as a result they become almost as intriguing as the primary characters.<br />The story begins when on her way home after a trip, Johanna finds a man unconscious on the path leading to Der Haven, reeking of liquor.  Unable to ignore anyone in need, Johanna brings the man to Der Haven, where she goes about treating his condition.<br />When Quentin Forster finally wakes, he doesn't have a clue where he is or how he got there.  But that is nothing new to Quentin, who has been suffering from terrifying spells of amnesia that leave him with nothing more than a impression of violence.  But Quentin is no ordinary man; he is one of the last survivors of a race of werewolves or loups-garous, noble and majestic creatures that have kept their existence hidden from the human world. Quentin has been running from his personal demons for years,but he finally may have found a place where he can stop running and begin to heal, if only he can find the courage to face the shadows that haunt him.<br />As time passes and Quentin settles in at Der Haven, Johanna is amazed at his ability to draw out the other patients, especially May.  But the biggest issue Johanna must face is her intense attraction to Quentin, which becomes harder and harder to deny, and threatens to interfere with Quentin's treatment.  Though afraid of what he may discover within himself, Quentin has great faith and trust in Johanna and her ability to make him whole again.  And it doesn't take long for Quentin's trust to become something deeper and more permanent - love.<br />But Quentin has many demons to face before he can even start to think about building a life with Johanna.  While hypnotized, Johanna is shocked to discover that Quentin becomes violent and evil, and also suffers from delusions that he is a werewolf. But worst of all is the emergence of an entirely separate personality, Fenris, the embodiment of all of Quentin's fear and hatred, created during his years of childhood abuse and torture.  Realizing she is in over her head and allowing her emotions to cloud her judgement, Johanna begins to doubt her ability to help Quentin.<br />But trouble is heading Johanna and Quentin's way.  Dr. Feodor Bolkonsky arrives in Silverado Springs under the guise of wanting to discuss hypnotism with a fellow doctor.  But it isn't long before Johanna discovers that Bolkonsky is really there to return May to her sexually abusive father.  Determined to keep May away from her father Johanna begins to construct a plan, and when Quentin finds out what's happening, he is determined to protect May at all costs.  However, Bolkonsky has another and much more sinister hidden agenda, and Johanna must find the courage within herself to trust, heal, and love Quentin in order to save him!<br />\\"Secret of the Wolf\\" is an affecting tale of love, self-discovery,and redemption.  Krinard shows amazing insight into the inner workings of the minds and hearts of her rich and vivid characters and these fascinating characters kept me utterly absorbed in the story because I cared so much about them.  Susan Krinard is one of the best paranormal romance authors out there, and \\"Secret of the Wolf\\" is a terrific read that does the genre proud.

Determined to make his own destiny, and not allow his life to be dictated by fate, Conal tries to push Allena away, and may just be throwing away his one chance at happiness and true love!  <BR>Being a Nora Roberts story, &quot;Ever After&quot; is undeniably a fabulous read.<br />&quot;Catch A Falling Star&quot; by Jill Gregory is a wonderful historical romance with just a dash of magic thrown in.  Princess Lianna of Penmarren has promised to marry Ambrose the Barbarian to keep peace in her father's land.  But Lianna is terrified by the prospect, as Ambrose is a ruthless warrior who supposedly murdered his first wife.

But soon the day Lianna has dreaded comes, when she learns the attack on Crow's Keep is imminent.  Will Lianna find a way to save Ambrose's home?  And will Ambrose believe that Lianna truly loves him, or will he be too shattered by her apparent betrayal to see the love she feels in her heart? <BR>This was an excellent tale, that had me really caring about Ambrose and Lianna, and praying for a happy ending.<br />&quot;The Curse of Castle Clough&quot; by Ruth Ryan Langan tells the story of Lord Robert Cameron.  Rob's heartless and incredibly wealthy ex-brother-in-law, Griffin Mackenzie, lent his late father fifteen million pounds for his many debts.  Knowing Rob will never be able to come up with that much money, Griffin gives him one month before Castle Clough becomes his.

As Estelle and Rob search for a way to save Castle Clough, they get a glimmer of hope from their spirit helper, the ghost of a young boy named Jamie.  If Jamie can just lead them to the &quot;Star of Scotland&quot;, a priceless diamond lost hundreds of years ago; their problems would be solved.  But does the Star of Scotland really exist?  And if so, will they be able to find it before Castle Clough is lost to the Cameron family forever?<BR>This was a heart-warming tale containing a truly lovely romance and just the right dose of fantasy.  I loved everything about it! <br />&quot;Starry, Starry Night&quot; by Marianne Willman is an excellent tale that rounds out the book perfectly.  Lily Kendall is on a much-needed vacation in St. Dunstan's village in Cornwall.  When she takes a nighttime walk along the beach, she gets caught by the rising tide, and narrowly escapes a watery grave because of a star-shaped window and the help of a handsome and mysterious man.  The man, Rees Tregarrick, takes Lily home, leaves her with his housekeeper then rudely disappears.  But when Lily awakes the next morning, she is no longer in Rees' home, but instead in a museum where Rees Tregarrick lived over a hundred years ago.  Confused and off-balance, Lily is convinced it was all a dream.  <BR>Several more encounters with Rees, however, convince Lily that she has somehow found a doorway into the past.  But Lily has fallen deeply in love with Rees, and wants to spend her life with him.  Are Rees and Lily destined to spend separate, lonely lives yearning for what can never be?  Or is their love strong enough to overcome time itself?  <BR>This is beautifully written and captivating tale that left me sighing over the magic of true love.  <br />&quot;Once Upon a Star&quot; is a superior romance anthology that doesn't contain even one poor story.

With a thrilling plot full of twists and turns and vivid and sympathetic characters, &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot; is a book you don't want to miss.<br />Syracuse Detective Vince O'Mally made a promise he knew was a mistake.  When the mother of two missing children made her umpteenth appearance in his office, Vince promised her he would find her son and daughter and bring them home.  So when Vince and his partner follow up a tip on a bad smell coming from a run-down house, Vince is shattered when he finds the savaged bodies of little Bobby and Kara Prague.  The only clue is a children's book hidden under the floorboards, &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot;, borrowed nearly twenty years ago from a library in a small town called Dilmun in upstate New York.<br />Vince is haunted by this case day and night, and when the FBI takes the case from the local police, Vince is furious.  Concerned with Vince's run-down appearance and obsessive behaviour, the Syracuse Chief of Police orders Vince to either take a month long vacation or see the police psychiatrist for an hour a day until the shrink deems Vince okay.  Unable to let this go, Vince takes the forced vacation, traveling to Dilmun to follow up on his only clue.  <br />The small town of Dilmun, located on Cayuga Lake is a close-knit and quiet community.  Upon his arrival Vince meets the beautiful and troubled Holly Newman, whose own sister was abducted and murdered twenty years ago while carrying the book &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot;, the very same book found in the house with Bobby and Kara Prague.  But the thing is, the man who killed Holly's sister confessed and is currently sitting in prison for the crime.  Seems open and shut, right?   Vince doesn't think so.  In fact, Vince is convinced that the man who killed Holly's sister is the same man who killed Bobby and Kara Prague, and he thinks that person lives right there in Dilmun.<br />Vince knows that Holly is the key to solving this case, and that the answers he so desperately needs are locked somewhere in her mind.  Vince spends more and more time with Holly as he tries to help her uncover the memories she has suppressed for all these years.  And though he has told himself over and over that the seemingly fragile and needy Holly isn't any good for him, Vince falls completely and hopelessly in love.<br />In addition to the two fantastic main characters, &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot; is filled with intriguing supporting characters too, such as retired and reclusive movie star Reginald D'Voe and his troubled niece Amanda.

US	43021965	R1ESB6VJYYUZ7I	0505524503	376574179	After Twilight	Books	4	13	13	N	N	A Great Anthology!	\\"After Twilight\\" is a satisfying paranormal romance anthology containing three well-written tales of mysterious and powerful men and the women who love them.  Though the first and last stories were a little uneven at times, that did not take away from my enjoyment of these darkly seductive tales.<br />\\"Masquerade\\" by Amanda Ashley tells the story of Jason Blackthorne, a vampire who has walked the earth utterly alone for the last three hundred years.  But a ray of light reaches his tortured soul when he sees Leanne performing in the play \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\".  Leanne bears an uncanny resemblance to Jason's long lost love, and as he gets to know her, she brings to life feelings in Jason that he thought were gone forever.  For once in his long existence, Jason has found happiness, but he knows that he loves Leanne far too much to inflict his dark curse on her, and he fears how she will react if she discovers what he really is.  Terrified that he will end up hurting Leanne if his bloodlust becomes too strong, Jason knows he must end their relationship.  Will losing Leanne destroy Jason's soul forever, or will the power of Leanne's love save Jason from an eternity of darkness?<BR>Though Jason was somewhat of the clichéd tortured monster, Ashley's compelling story still kept me turning pages.<br />\\"Dark Dream\\" by Christine Feehan is by far the best story in this anthology, and the main reason I bought it.  We are once again taken into Feehan's fabulous world of Carpathians, immortal beings who drink blood to survive but never kill those they feed on, can shape-shift into just about anything and can communicate by telepathy.  Falcon is one of the most ancient Carpathians, who was sent out by Prince Vladimir before the prince's untimely death to protect mortals and immortals alike from vampires, monsters without equal who were once Carpathians but chose to give up their souls for the momentary rush of the kill.  <BR>Falcon has long since lost his emotions and the ability to see in colour, as all male Carpathians do after a few hundred years of life, and the only thing that can save him from the darkness slowly consuming his soul is finding his lifemate, the one woman made specifically for him who can balance out his darkness with her light.  Convinced long ago that he would never find his lifemate, Falcon poured his heart out to her in a diary.  And now, when Falcon knows he is close to the edge, he is on his way back to his homeland to meet his new Prince and his once human lifemate before he ends his existence by greeting the dawn.  But on his journey, Falcon meets a woman in an alley in Romania, and suddenly he is bombarded by colour and emotion.  But just as suddenly as she appeared, the woman is gone, so Falcon sets out to find her.<BR>Sara Marten has spent the last fifteen years living a nightmare.  Her entire family was murdered by a vampire, and the terrifying monster now follows Sara wherever she goes.  So when she sees Falcon drinking the blood of a man, she believes he is a vampire too.  But when Falcon finds her and she gets a look at him, she sees the familiar face of her Dark Angel.  Because Sara found Falcon's diary fifteen years ago, and she has loved and cherished the words he wrote for her ever since.  <BR>Falcon and Sara are a fantastic couple, and the passion that sparks between makes for some wonderfully sensual reading.  Together, Falcon and Sara are determined to find and destroy the ancient vampire that has tortured Sara for all these years and the reader is treated to some thrilling and suspenseful scenes.  The story builds to a heart-pounding climax and as an extra treat; some old favourites from previous \\"Dark\\" books make an appearance!  \\"Dark Dream\\" is a wonderful read that really deserved a full-length book, but was still great just as it is.<br />\\"Midnight Serenade\\" by Ronda Thompson introduces Rick Donovan, a country veterinarian who is tormented by a curse - he's a werewolf.  When wildlife advocate Stephanie Shane rescues an injured wolf from some illegal hunters, she is bitten while trying to help the animal.  But this is no ordinary wolf, and Stephanie follows the trail of blood right into Rick Donovan's house.  Rick is terrified that he may have given Stephanie his curse by biting her, but as these two get to know each other, he can't help falling in love with her.  Stephanie too loses her heart to this handsome and reclusive vet, and their romance is both passionate and sweet.  But when Stephanie starts experiencing some strange changes, Rick knows his worst fears have become reality.  Will Rick have to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the woman he loves?  Or will fate intervene and allow these two to be together?<BR>Once again, we are given somewhat of the same old tortured monster, but the story had enough originality and interesting enough characters that I was still able to enjoy it.<br />\\"After Twilight\\" may well appeal to some readers more than others, but with the excellent Feehan story and the highly entertaining Ashley and Thompson stories, I think there is something in this anthology for everyone.  Each of these tales is a quick, romantic, and intriguing read and comes well recommended!	2002-07-18

Though \\"Hot Ice\\" is certainly not one of Nora's best works, it is still a fun-filled, exciting, and romantic read that I had trouble putting down.  So give this book a try, you may be pleasantly surprised.<br />Doug Lord is used to living his life on the run, due to his chosen profession - larceny.  Doug is great at what he does, but it looks like his luck may be running out since he crossed a terrifying and some say omnipotent criminal named Dimitri.  Injured and running for his life, Doug surprises New York heiress Whitney MacAllister when he leaps into her car, right before the bullets start flying.  Tired of her sheltered and smotheringly boring life, Whitney decides to help Doug, at least for a little while, and see where it takes her.  After losing the black sedan chasing them, Whitney brings Doug back to her apartment.<br />Doug knows money when he sees it, and he figures Whitney may just be his ticket to finding the treasure of a lifetime.  Doug has in his possession the stolen documents that lead to a legendary hidden fortune dating back to the French Revolution.  Whitney has the cash and the connections Doug needs, but the only way Whitney will agree to help Doug is if she becomes his partner.  Doug never works with partners, having been burned one too many times, but he figures he can bring Whitney along until he has what he needs from her and then ditch her.<br />So Doug and Whitney's adventure begins.  With Dimitri's hired muscle always right behind them, Doug and Whitney need to be smart and fast.  Their dangerous encounters with Dimitri's men make for some wonderfully suspenseful scenes that will have readers on the edge of their seats.  <br />The stolen documents lead Doug and Whitney to Madagascar, where their journey begins in earnest, but complications abound.  Whitney doesn't trust Doug one little bit, and Doug surely doesn't trust Whitney.  But as time passes, the ever present spark between them gets brighter and brighter, until it's nearly impossible to resist.  Doug knows that letting himself fall for Whitney could very well cost him his big break, but in the end, his heart doesn't give him much choice.  Whitney too finds herself falling in love, as she gets to know the intelligent, determined, perceptive, and funny man underneath Doug's sexy exterior.  So as these two race through the exotic lands and rainforests of Madagascar with hired killers never more than a step behind, Whitney and Doug find a passionate love in each others arms that they never expected to find.  But Doug knows a thief like him has no future with a classy lady like Whitney.  Unfortunately, that's not the biggest problem on Doug's mind, because the dangerous game he and Whitney are playing may end up being fatal!<br />I thought Doug was a wonderful character.  He was smart, handsome, intriguing and very real.  Though Whitney's character sometimes grated on my nerves a bit with her occasional spoiled rich girl attitude and her annoying little account book, for the most part, I was able to overlook her flaws and see the sensitive and strong woman beneath.  Whitney and Doug undeniably make a great team, and their amazing adventure kept me glued to the pages.<br />Overall, \\"Hot Ice\\" was a very enjoyable read.  The story never stops, and is filled with thrilling suspense and red-hot romance.  I am extremely glad I decided to take a chance and buy this book when I found it, because otherwise I would have missed out on some great entertainment.  So don't believe everything you read, buy this book today and form an opinion for yourself, I most certainly did not regret it!	2002-07-17

Well Worth the Wait!	\\"Cordina's Royal Family\\" is an omnibus of three stories written by Nora Roberts in the mid-1980's.  I have searched for these three out of print tales for years, so imagine my delight when I discovered that they were to be re-printed in a special 3-in-1 collector's edition.  Well, I am happy to report that it was worth the wait.  Nora's three tales of royal romance and palace intrigue are, in a word, fantastic!<br />First is \\"Affaire Royale\\", which introduces the reader to Her Serene Highness Princess Gabriella de Cordina.  Gabriella has just lived through a terrifying ordeal - being kidnapped.  But Brie can't remember anything.  Not who kidnapped her or how she escaped, not who her father and brothers are, not even her own name.  Concerned about the safety of his only daughter, Prince Armand hires bodyguard Reeve MacGee to protect Brie.  <BR>Lost in a sea of concerned, unfamiliar faces, Brie finds a lifeline in Reeve.  Reeve sets about helping Gabriella regain her memories, and as time passes he falls hard for the classy, determined, and remarkable Brie.  Though he tries to remind himself that letting his emotions get involved will only cloud his senses while trying to protect Gabriella, Reeve well and truly loses his heart.  But Reeve also knows that a guy like him has no future with a princess, and so he keeps what is in his heart to himself.<BR>Though she is confused and scared and trying to find herself, Brie knows that the one thing that's real in her life is the love she feels for Reeve.  Trying to accept that he doesn't love her the way she loves him isn't easy, though Gabriella was never one to give up when she wanted something.  The passion that burns between Reeve and Brie will thrill and entice readers.  But the threat to Brie is closer to home than anyone realizes, and though Reeve believes he has to let her go, he would never recover if the kidnappers' violent plans for Brie succeed!<br />Next is \\"Command Performance\\", which is even better than the delightful first story.  His Royal Highness Prince Alexander is the heir to the Cordinian throne, and as a result he must always keep his emotions, and his temper, on a tight rein.  Regal and enticing Eve Hamilton, the one woman Alex truly desires, has always seemed just out of his reach.  Seemingly in love with his younger brother Bennett, when Eve comes to Cordina at his request, Alex knows a frustration unlike anything he has ever known.  Eve, the manager of her own theatre troupe, is commissioned by Alex to put on four plays to benefit a children's charity.  Though Alex is forever rubbing Eve the wrong way, she knows her troupe's first international performance is an opportunity too great to pass up.<BR>But all is not perfect in Cordina.  The man behind Princess Gabriella's kidnapping several years earlier, Deboque, is terrorizing Cordina with bombings.  Next, Deboque begins using Eve to threaten the Royal Family.  Alex is terrified for Eve's safety, but Eve is resolute that she will remain in Cordina and do her job.  <BR>As the misunderstandings that were keeping them apart are worked out, Eve and Alex are finally able to admit their true feelings for one another.  Alex knows he will never love another woman the way he loves Eve, and their romance is full of sensuality and tenderness and is highly satisfying.<BR>But both Alex and Eve are in grave danger.  When Deboque issues a serious threat, it has everyone on edge.  But what everyone doesn't realize is that Eve herself has become a target and the happiness she has finally found with Alex may well be snatched away from her!<br />Last, but certainly not least is \\"The Playboy Prince\\", which tells the story of dashingly handsome ladies man Prince Bennett.  When reserved and conservative Hannah Rothchild arrives at the palace, Bennett can't figure her out.  She couldn't be less his type, and yet something about her intrigues him.  Hannah wears no make-up and her clothes are unflattering, and yet she is irresistible to Bennett.  So for once in his life, Bennett finds himself compelled to look beyond what is on the outside of a woman in order to find out who she is on the inside.  <BR>In truth, Hannah is on a secret and dangerous mission and the attention Bennett keeps giving her is not good for the job she has come to do.  But her treacherous heart skips a beat each time Bennett is near, and the woman behind the boring and unattractive facade longs to feel Bennett's arms around her.  However, Hannah has never failed on a job before and she's not about to let Bennett keep her from doing this one.  Still, Hannah can't keep herself from falling for the \\"Royal Rake\\" and Bennett too falls in love with the sweet and shy Hannah he knows.  <BR>So when Bennett discovers the real reason Hannah is in the palace, he feels completely betrayed and is hurt beyond words.  Hannah feels her heart break at the contempt Bennett now feels for her, and she is consumed by guilt.  But the game Hannah is playing is incredibly dangerous, and now Bennett knows that.  Despite all that has happened, the thought of anything happening to Hannah turns Bennetts blood to ice.  Roberts builds this last tale to a thrilling climax that will have readers on the edge of their seats, and a most satisfying conclusion.<br />Once again Nora Roberts has created a family that readers will come to love and cherish as if it were their own.  \\"Cordina's Royal Family\\" is a fun-filled and exciting read that you don't want to miss.

My New Favourite Series!	\\"Dead Until Dark\\" by Charlaine Harris is a phenomenal read filled with intriguing, likable characters and a wonderfully original storyline that made this book impossible to put down.  I was utterly absorbed in this fast-paced and thrilling story and loved EVERY minute of it!<br />Sookie Stackhouse lives in a small town in rural Louisiana and makes her living working in a bar called Merlotte's.  But Sookie has a kind of disability, she's a telepath, though most people just think she's crazy.  The truth of the matter is that poor Sookie is nearly DRIVEN crazy by all the thoughts belonging to other people whizzing around in her head all day long.  Which makes it pretty hard for Sookie to have a normal dating life.  It's not that she isn't pretty, because she is, it's just that Sookie finds it hard to get in the mood with someone who is critiquing her ... or wishing she was someone else.<br />Then one day, Bill the vampire walks into her work and sits down, and all she hears from him is . . . NOTHING!  There is a blissful silence in the region where Bill's thoughts should be invading her mind and Sookie is overjoyed.  But when she listens into some human thoughts she finds out that Bill is in serious danger.  Sookie manages to save Bill's life (or should that be death?) and then Bill and Sookie's relationship grows from there.<br />But strange things are happening in the sleepy little town of Bon Temps.  Young women are turning up dead, strangled, and each of them has vampire bites on her body.  And though Bill and Sookie are growing closer by the day, Bill hangs out with a seriously creepy bunch of vampires who are suspected of these murders.<br />Bill and Sookie are one of the BEST couples I have encountered in a long while.  They have an intense chemistry with each other that makes for some amazingly erotic and sensual encounters to tantalize readers.  But in addition to that passion, Bill and Sookie come to truly love and care about one another and I had a hard timeremembering that they weren't real friends of mine.<br />So while Bill and Sookie become more and more important to one another, many circumstances try to tear them apart.  The head honcho vampire of the area, Eric (a former Viking) wants Sookie to use her telepathic skills to help him find someone who's stealing from him, and he wants Sookie for himself.  The murders that keep occurring make hatred against vampires a common thing in the town of Bon Temps, which could spell disaster for Bill.  Sookie's boss, Sam, suddenly decides to make a play for Sookie when he sees that he is losing her to Bill and in addition to all this, Sookie thinks she may be next on the murderer's list, as a waitress from her work becomes the next victim.<br />All of these complications build towards a thrilling climax and, very sadly, the end of the book.  Luckily for me I had \\"Living Dead in Dallas\\" as well so I didn't have to wait to read more about my new favourite vampire, the undeniably sexy Bill, and the witty, quirky, and just plain wonderful Sookie.  And by the way \\"Living Dead in Dallas\\" is just as good as \\"Dead Until Dark\\", I'd give them both 6 stars if I could!  <br />All-in-all, you just don't want to miss \\"Dead Until Dark\\".

Unfortunately, one of those DPI \\"scientists\\" is the guardian of Tamara, one of The Chosen (a rare human who has the two properties necessary to be changed into a vampire).  Though all vampires feel the need to watch over and protect The Chosen, there is always one specific vampire who feels that pull more strongly than all the others.  Which is exactly the case with Eric, who has always felt drawn to the lovely Tamara.  And though he is overwhelmed by the terrible loneliness of his existence, Eric fears what will happen if he claims Tamara for his own.  But when she repeatedly calls out to him in her anguished dreams and begins to believe she is losing her mind, Eric can do no other than go to her and try to ease her suffering.  The chemistry between Eric and Tamara sizzles in the air, and Shayne skilfully pulls her readers into their story until it's impossible to put the book down.<br />\\"Twilight Memories\\" tells the story of Roland, Eric's oldest and dearest friend, who lives a life of self-imposed solitude in a huge old castle in France.  Roland has sworn to protect a young boy named Jamey, one of The Chosen, and when the DPI arrives in his small French town, he knows there's going to be trouble.  Especially when Rhiannon, a three thousand year old vampire from ancient Egypt, who has flitted in and out of Roland's life for centuries, arrives to help him protect young Jamey.  Roland is constantly exasperated by Rhiannon's carelessness with her own safety, which she does mostly to prove that she is worthy of Roland's affections.  But because Roland fears the darkness that dwells deep inside him, a bloodthirsty demon he holds rigorously in check, he constantly thwarts Rhiannon's attempts to seduce him.  Unfortunately, Roland's constant denials leave Rhiannon feeling hurt and rejected, and thinking that Roland believes she isn't good enough for him.  As the dangerous threat of the DPI closes in around them, Roland and Rhiannon struggle to keep Jamey safe.  And when the boy is kidnapped by the DPI, they will do anything to get him back.  But will they be able to admit their true feelings to one another and finally find happiness in each other's embrace?<br />Finally, \\"Twilight Illusions\\" introduces Damien, the oldest and greatest of his kind, six thousand years old and capable of many feats others of his race can only dream of.  Damien is a magician who lives a life devoid of friends for fear of losing them as he did his dearest friend Enkidu thousands of years ago.  But at one of his shows he senses one of The Chosen and chooses her to be his volunteer, even though he knows the feelings she evokes in him can only bring him pain.  But Shannon is a woman on a mission, a PI investigating the death of her best friend, Tawny, who died the night she volunteered at Damien's magic show.  Shannon believes Damien may have murdered her, and when she follows him home and confronts him, Damien fears he may have killed Tawny without knowing it.  But he knows if he didn't, Shannon may well be next, so despite his better judgement he is determined to watch over her and keep her safe.  As Shannon gets to know Damien, she realizes that he could not possibly be capable of murder, and finds herself falling for him.

Darius is an immensely powerful Carpathian, but after losing his emotions and the ability to see colours hundreds of years ago, he is dangerously close to turning vampire, one of the vile, soulless creatures he has spent his entire life hunting and destroying.  The only thing keeping Darius from turning is his desire to keep his family safe and his own code of honour.  But there is only one thing that can save Darius and ensure he never turns - finding his lifemate, a compassionate woman to balance out his darkness with her light.<br />Darius' sister Desari is a famous singer and as a result their family unit is constantly travelling.  In order to maintain a human image, Darius and his family travel using human transport, including a large bus that is constantly breaking down.  To remedy this situation, Desari convinces Darius to let her hire a mechanic to travel along with them.  <br />Desperate for money and a place to stay, Tempest, a small red-headed mechanic, responds to Desari's ad.  When Darius first lays eyes on Tempest, his world explodes into colours and he is bombarded with emotions.  After all these centuries of darkness, Darius has finally found his lifemate, but she is human, not Carpathian (though she does possess psychic abilities).  Tempest is undeniably drawn to Darius and his piercing black eyes, but she knows that he is different and immensely powerful.  When Tempest discovers what Darius and his family really are after Darius drinks her blood, she is terrified and attempts to run away.  But Darius is not about to let his one chance at salvation get away and he inevitably finds her and brings her back.<br />As time passes Tempest begins to feel like she belongs with Darius, and though she still fears him, she also begins to respect and love him.  The passion Darius feels for Tempest is almost too much for him to bear, and when these two act on their feelings for one another the reader is treated to some wonderfully sensual scenes.<br />Darius has finally found the happiness he so deserves, but he knows that his happiness is fleeting, for Tempest will age and die just like any normal human.  Darius knows he will not be able to survive without Tempest, and if he converts her to a Carpathian he runs the risk of turning her into a deranged vampiress.  So Darius makes the decision to age and die with Tempest, much to his family's distress.<br />Darius and Tempest must find a way to balance Darius' overpowering need to control Tempest and keep her safe with Tempest's need to be free to make her own choices and be her own woman.  Tempest has a penchant for finding trouble wherever she goes, which is bad news with a secret society of vampire hunters closing in on them.  These horrible vampire hunters do not understand or care about the distinction between Carpathians and vampires, and are out to destroy them all.  And now that they know of Tempest's association with Darius and Desari, she is in grave danger. <br />\\"Dark Fire\\" is an exciting and erotic read that will keep readers captivated.  It is wonderful to see such a mighty Carpathian as Darius undone by the thoughtfulness of a small red-headed human.  Will he make the ultimate sacrifice and end his life with Tempest?

But Julian isn't about to let his one chance at salvation die, so he gives blood to Desari to keep her alive.<br />It's not long before Julian makes a second shocking discovery when he finds out that Desari is indeed a Carpathian, and that she and four other Carpathians including her brother Darius have been alive and well for centuries without anyone knowing of their existence.<br />Desari is wary of Julian at first and is disconcerted by the power he has over her.  She feels an intense physical and emotional pull towards him, but she does not know for sure if she can trust him.  Desari is extremely powerful in her own right and is determined to maintain her freedom.  Julian on the other hand desperately wants to keep his lifemate safe, and believes that her singing in front of thousands of people is just asking for trouble.<br />Though Desari is not sure what to make of Julian, she cannot resist the feelings he brings to life inside of her.

There is lots of tension between Julian and Darius, much to Desari's dismay, and these two powerful Carpathians slowly but surely come to terms with one another.  And it's a very good thing that they have learned to work (grudgingly) together, because a painful secret from Julian's past is about to come back to haunt him, and it's going to take all of Julian and Darius' combined strength to destroy the ancient evil they are about to confront!<br />\\"Dark Challenge\\" is a truly wonderful read.

Though Gregori was perilously close to turning vampire without Savannah's light to counteract his growing darkness, he selflessly decided to give her five years of freedom before claiming her as his lifemate.  And now that those five years are up, nothing and no one will stand between Gregori and his destiny.<br />But Savannah is terrified of Gregori, an ancient with unequalled powers feared by all of her kind.

Enchanting!	\\"Face the Fire\\" by Nora Roberts is the final instalment in the enchanting Three Sisters Island trilogy, which has captivated me from book one.  Staying true to its predecessors, this final book does not disappoint.  Full of vivid and insightful characterizations, steamy romance, and just the right dose of fantasy, \\"Face the Fire\\" will leave you believing in magic.<br />Mia Devlin is a strong, determined, and savvy businesswoman and an immensely powerful witch.  She has great friends, especially Nell and Ripley, her sisters of the heart and fellow witches, a beautiful home and garden, and a wonderful bookstore that does great business, but Mia isn't truly happy.  Ever since Sam Logan walked out of her life eleven years ago, leaving her young heart in pieces on the ground, she has closed off a part of herself that she never plans to open again.<br />Everything is going fine with her plan to keep her heart blocked off from ever being broken again, until the day that Sam Logan strolls into her bookstore and back into her life.  But Mia greets Sam, who has returned to Three Sisters to reclaim her, with painfully polite icy indifference.  For though the energy still snaps and sparks in the air between them, Mia knows she just won't survive having her heart torn out a second time.<br />But Sam is here to stay, and he won't give Mia up without a fight.  The interplay between Mia and Sam is expertly rendered by Roberts, as we watch Mia's range of reactions to Sam's persistence.  When they are together, Mia and Sam all but send sparks from the pages, sometimes in passion and sometimes in pure frustration and anger.  <br />But no matter what Mia decides is in her heart, she had better do it fast, because the deadline for breaking a centuries old curse is mere months away.  Mia can feel the evil forces hovering around the edges of her world, and if she doesn't win the fight against that evil, the people she loves will be in great danger, and the Island she so loves will fall into the sea.<br />\\"Face the Fire\\" is a fantastic read and I will most definitely read it again.  It was wonderful to see lots of Nell & Zack and Ripley & Mac in this novel (the main characters from the two previous books in the trilogy).  Mia is a wonderfully strong and courageous heroine who readers will become very attached to.  And though it's fun watching Sam squirm when he first arrives on Three Sisters, he will win readers over with his sincere devotion to Mia and keeping her safe.  This book is full of magic and romance, and contains a lovely tale of true love and destiny that I found irresistible.  \\"Face the Fire\\" comes highly recommended, so buy it today!	2002-06-03

A Must Read!	\\"Dark Desire\\" by Christine Feehan, the second instalment in the \\"Dark\\" series is an utterly captivating and beautifully written tale that far surpasses its already excellent predecessor.  I recommend that readers who are new to Feehan's series start with the first instalment, \\"Dark Prince\\" which provides the necessary background information on the Carpathian people.  <br />Carpathians are a separate race of people who require blood to survive but never kill the humans they feed on.  Carpathians are immensely powerful immortal beings, gifted with telepathy, the ability to shape-shift into any form, and the ability to communicate with and control animals.  However, the Carpathian race is dying out.  There are very few female Carpathians left and almost all of the babies born are male.  After several centuries, if a Carpathian has not found his lifemate, he loses the ability to see in colour and feel emotions.  As time passes the temptation becomes greater and greater for the Carpathian to turn into a vampire, the feared creature of folklore, who kills his victims for the rush of feeling the kill provides.<br />\\"Dark Desire\\" begins with the book's hero Jacques in the hands of the merciless and evil vampire hunters.  He is endlessly tormented and finally buried alive.  In his little slice of hell, Jacques' only link to the outside world is through a woman many miles away in America.  He is able to link with her for short periods of time and attempts to call her to him.  When she does not respond, he assumes that she is one of the humans who had a part in torturing him, and determines that he will have his revenge.<br />Shea O'Halloran thinks she is going crazy.  She constantly dreams of a frightening man with jet black eyes who seems to be calling out to her.  She experiences terrible bouts of unbearable pain, that even she, as a doctor cannot begin to explain.  After seven years of these strange occurrences, Shea feels compelled to travel to the Carpathian Mountains, hoping that she will be able to find a cure for the strange blood disorder she suffers from in the land her unknown father came from.  A blood disorder that keeps her on the run from a couple of dangerous fanatics convinced that she is a vampire. <br />When Shea arrives at her destination, she feels a deep connection with the land around her and a sense of rightness that has always eluded her.  A strange compulsion leads her out into the forest where she finally comes upon an abandoned and burned down cabin.  Inside, buried in the wall, she finds Jacques who bites her savagely thinking that she is the enemy.  But Shea feels that she must help this poor, injured man, and manages to transport him to her cabin where she begins to tend his horrific wounds.<br />As time passes, Jacques realizes what an amazing and compassionate woman Shea is.  His fractured mind also knows that this red haired beauty is his lifemate.  The relationship between Jacques and Shea is brilliantly rendered.  Their struggle to come to terms with each other and themselves is truly affecting, and the love they share is passionate and intense.  Jacques' struggle with the beast inside him is vividly drawn.  Likewise, Shea's struggle to balance intimacy with her need for independence is incredibly vivid and very realistic.<br />But while Jacques and Shea try to deal with their emotions, they must also deal with dangers all around them.  Jacques must learn to trust his fellow Carpathians again (and it's great to see Mikhail, Raven, and Gregori from \\"Dark Prince\\"), because they need to come together to fight the ruthless vampire hunters lead by a powerful vampire who are determined to destroy them all!<br />\\"Dark Desire\\" is a fantastic read that will leave you craving more of the sexy Carpathians.  The characters are rich and well developed and the storyline is well thought out and completely fulfilling.  I was really impressed by this book, and will certainly be looking for more of Christine Feehan's work.  So buy this book today and get ready for an intense, suspenseful, and very sensual read.

The premise for the Dark series is highly original and very entertaining.  With a dark and dangerous hero who all but sends sparks from the pages, this sexy tale will leave female readers breathless.<br />Feehan has created a fascinating race of people with her Carpathians.  Carpathians are immortal beings at one with nature who need blood to survive but never kill those they feed on.  They have many special gifts such as the ability to shape-shift into any form, telepathy, and the ability to communicate with animals.  However, the Carpathian race is dying out.  There are very few female Carpathians left, and nearly all the babies born are male and do not make it through their first year.  After centuries of life, male Carpathians lose the ability to see in colour and to feel emotions.  The only way to remedy this is to find their lifemate, their female counterpart and the light to their darkness.  If the Carpathian cannot find his lifemate, he must either seek the sun and kill himself, or turn into a true vampire, a creature that kills its prey mercilessly, in order to receive the rush of feeling the kill provides.<br />This tale begins as our hero, Mikhail Dubrinsky, prince of the Carpathians, is about to seek the sun and end his life.  He can no longer stand the isolation and monotony of his colourless life, and so plans to end his existence.  In his bleakest hour, suddenly a human woman makes contact with his mind.  The human woman, Raven, convinces Mikhail not to take his life, and Mikhail is so intrigued by her that he seeks her out.  Mikhail quickly realizes that since his contact with Raven he is seeing in colour and is feeling real emotions for the first time in centuries.<br />Could this tiny human be Mikhail's lifemate?  She is unlike any woman Mikhail has ever met, so lonely and yet so filled with compassion and goodwill.  Raven gives Mikhail a gift more precious than any other, the gift of hope for the future.<br />Raven Whitney is visiting the Carpathian Mountains on a well-deserved vacation.  She is taking a break from her job of telepathically tracking serial killers, wanting to rid herself of the taint of the sick and twisted minds she has been inside of.  But when she meets Mikhail, it seems that relaxation isn't in the cards for her.  Raven knows that Mikhail isn't like other men.  He is intense and brooding, and seems to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Raven is overcome by the powerful feelings she develops for Mikhail in such a short time.  And likewise, Mikhail recognizes that Raven is the only woman for him.  She is his soul, his heart, his life, and he is hers.<br />But many things stand in the way of Mikhail and Raven's happiness.  There is a group of ruthless vampire hunters in the area murdering those they think are vampires and hunting Mikhail's family and friends.  Mikhail knows that Raven will be in danger from these assassins and he is determined to protect her at all costs.  Mikhail knows he must hunt down the assassins and stop their evil and fanatical campaign, despite the danger to himself.<br />Mikhail longs to make Raven Carpathian like him, for if he does not she will age and die like any human and will take him with her to the grave.  Without Raven there is no Mikhail, but every human that they have tried to convert has gone mad and has had to be destroyed.  Will Raven be able to deal with the change to Carpathian?  Or is insanity all that awaits her?  Her psychic gifts may help her through the transformation, but is Mikhail willing to take the risk?<br />As Mikhail tries to keep his people and Raven safe from the fanatics, he must decide what the future holds for himself and Raven.  But a horrible incident takes the choice out of Mikhail's hands and now all he can do is wait and see if Raven will survive, and if so, if she will ever be able toforgive him.<br />\\"Dark Prince\\" is a wonderfully sexy tale, full of passion and tenderness, danger and suspense.  Mikhail is a fantastic hero who readers will fall in love with.  Likewise, Raven is a truly beautiful heroine, inside and out, and it's impossible not to love her.  Feehan has created an exciting and deeply sensual fantasy world that will captivate readers.  This story is fresh and fun and comes highly recommended!	2002-05-01

It took me several days to get through the first 200 pages, which is absolutely unheard of for me.  But after that it really picked up and I was captivated by the story, until I had finished the entire second half of the book in one sitting.  So, though the first two hundred pages were slow reading, I feel that Krinard redeems herself with the exciting and well-written conclusion.<BR>Lady Rowena Forster wants nothing to do with her werewolf - or loups-garous - blood.  She fled England to New York several years ago, to escape an arranged marriage to a man she has never met.  However, ironically, once in America, Rowena was wooed and is now engaged to the very man she was determined to avoid.  Her fianc, Cole MacLean, a fellow werewolf and wealthy financier, is a man who hides his cruel and murderess practices behind a veil of manners and wealth.  Rowena would be appalled at the blood on her fianc's hands, but she is completely unaware of who Cole really is.<BR>Tomas Randall, also known as \\"El Lobo\\", is a lifelong enemy of Cole and the entire MacLean family, who murdered both his parents and stole his family's land.  This dashing outlaw has dedicated his life to having his revenge on the MacLeans, and has decided to steal Cole's soon-to-be wife out from under his nose.  Tomas convinces Rowena to go West with him, telling her that her twin brother Quentin needs her help.<BR>But once Tomas has kidnapped Rowena, who hides behind her \\"Lady of Ice\\" exterior, he begins to see her less and less as a means to an end and more and more as a lovely, courageous, and compassionate woman.  Rowena too finds her Lady of Ice appearance melting under the heat of the passion she feels for Tomas.  And though they both fight against the tender and unfamiliar feelings they have for each other, they don't stand a chance against the power of their love.<BR>But many things stand between Tomas and Rowena's happiness.  Cole MacLean is determined to find his fianc and get her back, because nobody, especially not a Randall, can get away with stealing something that belongs to him.  And Cole will use any method necessary to catch \\"El Lobo\\" and claim his woman.  So while they must find a way to neutralize Cole MacLean's threat, Tomas and Rowena must also work through their own insecurities and issues, and find the courage to express what they are feeling.  Because neither of them are willing to tell the other how they truly feel, and they may just let their one chance at happiness slip away!<BR>This western romance, set in 1878 contains a provocative and engaging love story, once it gets going.  The beginning of the book may seem to drag on, or it may not, depending on the individual reader.  It's not so much that the first half contains poor writing, it has beautiful descriptive settings and great character development, but it's just that nothing much really happens until the second half of the book.  I've wavered back and forth between a three and a four star rating for this book (if I could I'd rate it ***1/2 stars), but in the end, I feel that the second half went a long way to redeeming the entire book, so four stars it is!  \\"Once a Wolf\\" is an original and enjoyable book, and it is most definitely worth the read.	2002-04-17

For years Braden has searched for the lost branch of the Forster family, hoping to find his distant cousins and restore them to The Cause, but to no avail.<BR>Cassidy Holt, the distant cousin Braden is seeking, is the half-human daughter of a werewolf mother, born and raised in America.  Orphaned at the tender age of seven, before her mother had a chance to teach her how to be loups-garous, Cassidy was taken in by her human father's brother, Jonas.  Life with her human aunt and uncle was always unhappy for Cassidy, who was constantly aware that she was unwanted and feared.  For years Cassidy dreamed of finding her mother's family in England, a family who could teach her all about being loups-garous.

Cassidy finds herself undeniably drawn to Braden, and bravely stands by him even while he tries to push her away.  <BR>Past betrayals have left Braden scarred both physically and emotionally, and he is not eager to open himself up for that kind of hurt again.

Krinard skilfully absorbs her readers into the lives of Cassidy and Braden, making their trials and triumphs palpable.  This wonderful story of love and redemption is a truly satisfying read.

Unbeknownst to him at the time, that small silver lady was one of the Three Fates, three long-separated and priceless statues.  The Fate Felix saved from sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean became a family heirloom, passed down through the generations.<BR>Fast forward to 2002, as Malachi, Gideon, and Rebecca Sullivan are determined to recover their great-great-grandfather's treasure from an unscrupulous antiquities dealer, Anita Gaye, who stole it from underneath their noses.  They plan to reunite all three of the Fates, and will do everything in their power to keep them out of the wrong hands.<BR>Their quest will take them from their home in Ireland to Helsinki, where the eldest brother, Malachi, meets a lovely, brilliant, but neurotic professor, Tia Marsh, whose vast knowledge of Greek mythology will be a great asset to their search.  <BR>Next, Gideon travels to Prague, where he tracks down Cleo Toliver, an exotic dancer and the ancestor of a reputed contact to the Fates.

Hamilton's first published novel, and it is, for the most part, well written and highly entertaining.  This book is action-packed and filled with interesting characters who live in an intriguing fantasy world.  <BR>\\"Nightseer\\" is a little slow at the beginning, and it takes a while to become familiar with the alternate reality Hamilton has created, but once the story gets going it moves at a lightning fast pace.<BR>The story revolves around noble half-elf Keleios Nightseer, skilled prophet and master enchanter.  Upon reaching adulthood, Keleois found herself gifted with the power of sorcery, and so she was forced to relinquish her master status and return to the magic school at Zeln's Keep to learn to control her new power.<BR>Entering a state of prophecy, Keleios has a terrible vision - the Keep under attack and on fire and the students and masters taken prisoner or killed.  Keleios barely has time to warn the residents before the attack is under way, the Keep betrayed by Keleios' roommate Fidelis, a student of Harque, the evil witch who killed her mother years ago. Keleios manages to assemble a small group of survivors, consisting of herself, Tobin, a young prince, Lothor, a dark healer who agrees to help Keleios only if she agrees to be his consort, Master Eroar, a shape-shifting dragon, and Poth, a cat with powers of sorcery.  These five must fight against the demonic forces threatening to destroy them.  Keleios, who once walked the pit of Hell in a quest of revenge for her mother, bears the mark of demonic corruption, which gives her a certain power over demons.  <BR>Keleios and the rest of her team are betrayed by a ruthless High Councilman, and delivered into the hands of Harque.  Now Keleios and her friends must struggle to free themselves from the evil witch and her demonic minions.  And Keleios seeks to have her revenge on her mothers' murderer.<BR>\\"Nightseer\\" is full of non-stop action and thrilling suspense.  Hamilton has created yet another fascinating world that her readers can immerse themselves in.  Though there are some flaws in the plot, it is on the whole a very impressive first effort.

For the last ten years, he has enjoyed his quiet, peaceful life as Nathan King, Boston antiques expert.  But his life is suddenly turned upside down when he sees a fuzzy photograph in the paper of a woman who looks like his beloved Nidaba, who he lost over 4000 years ago.  The article describes a miracle in which this woman fell from the roof of a building and survived.<BR>Natum immediately travels to the mental hospital where the mystery woman is being held, and comes face to face with the love of his life, Nidaba.  Unfortunately, she has been drugged into a state of catatonia and seems unaware of Natum's presence.  Natum begins to concoct a plan to get Nidaba out of the hospital secretly, so as not to alert the Dark Immortal Witches as to the whereabouts of this immensely powerful, but currently helpless, Immortal Light Witch.  What he doesn't know is that the Dark Witch Puabi is already there, and is planning to take Nidaba's heart at her first opportunity.<br />Only Natum stands in the way of Puabi's success, but he first must rekindle the love he and Nidaba shared, so they can stand united against their evil enemy and face their destiny together.<BR>Shayne skilfully blends the present day romance and suspense of Nidaba and Natum, with fascinating flashbacks to their life together in ancient Sumer.

Hamilton's new series about faerie Princess Meredith NicEssus, and it does not disappoint. This book picks up where the first of the series \\"A Kiss of Shadows\\" left off, and focuses on developing the intriguing characters we met in the fantastic first book. This is a sexy, dangerous, and fun-filled adventure that you won't want to miss!<BR>In order to fully appreciate this novel, it is actually quite important to read \\"A Kiss of Shadows\\" first. This book jumps right into Merry's world without much preamble, and without the background from the first of the series, it would be tough to follow.<BR>Meredith NicEssus, Princess of Flesh and co-heir to the Unseelie throne has returned to LA from her home in Illinois to continue her life as an investigator for Grey's Detective Agency. But she has not returned alone. Merry has brought five members of the Queen's royal guard and a half-sidhe goblin along with her. These fearsome and beautiful sidhe warriors are auditioning with pleasure for the role of future king, as Merry desperately tries to conceive a child in order to gain the throne. <BR>Merry's evil and unbalanced cousin, Prince Cel, will do just about anything to keep Merry from becoming queen. Whoever can produce an heir first, Merry or Cel, will become the next Unseelie ruler.  Luckily for Merry, she has a six-month head start while Cel undergoes a punishment for his crimes against her.  But even with Cel out of the picture, Merry is far from safe.  When Merry agrees to assist an exiled Seelie goddess, Maeve Reed, she angers the ruler of the Seelie court, King Taranis, who has forbidden any sidhe to have contact with Maeve.  <BR>In addition to this, a creature known as the Nameless, made up of all the most bizarre and formidable powers of all the Seelie and Unseelie fey has been set free.  And chances are that someone has loosed this unstoppable monster in an attempt to murder Merry.<BR>With all the danger she is in, Merry needs each and every one of her guards, who we really get to know in this book.  I love all of Merry's men, and though she is intimate with six men, she has deep and sincere feelings for all of them.  Hamilton has done a fabulous job in this book of fleshing out Merry's lovers.  Doyle and Frost are my two favorites, and I just can't get enough of them.  These two add great depth to the story.  Rhys, Galen, and Nicca, the other three guards, are also very interesting characters.  Another of my favorites is Kitto the goblin.  He is sooo cute, and his growth throughout the novel was wonderful to see.<BR>So, while Merry tries to stay alive, deals with Unseelie court politics and forms alliances, she is building some very complex and intimate relationships with her guards.  And it is this bonding and the way Merry and the men interact, that makes this story so interesting.  Hamilton has created a wonderful cast of characters in Merry's magical world. These characters are so skilfully rendered and so fascinating, that readers will desperately want to get to know them better. <BR>I really enjoyed \\"A Caress of Twilight\\". Merry is an exceptional character who promises great things in books to come. You don't want to miss this new series; it is tons of thrilling and sensual fun, so buy both of Merry's books today!	2002-04-02

Hamilton finds our heroine, Anita Blake, necromancer and vampire executioner, at a crossroads in her life.  Can she live with the things she has done?  How far has she fallen from God's graces?  As Anita examines her life, she is involved in yet another dangerous adventure, which sweeps the reader away into Anita's weird and wonderful world.<BR>I have trouble saying this book was excellent, because I am not a Richard fan, and though I have tried really hard to like him, I just can't do it.  So, because Anita betrayed Jean-Claude, her super sexy vampire lover, with Richard, who could not be more wrong for her, the entire book was tainted for me as a result.  With that said, however, it is still a thrilling and fun-filled read that I did enjoy, just not as much as all the others.<BR>In this 8th instalment of the series, Anita receives a call informing her that her ex-fianc, Richard Zeeman, junior high science teacher and alpha werewolf, has been arrested for rape in Tennessee.  Anita drops everything and goes to help Richard, despite the fact the local Master Vampire has forbidden her to enter his territory.<BR>When Anita arrives, she starts trying to solve the mystery of who would want to frame Richard for rape and why.  It becomes immediately obvious that the local police are corrupt, and are trying to run them out of town.  But that's not all Anita has on her plate.  Colin, the Master Vampire, is giving Anita and her entourage serious problems, threatening them and harming their people.  Anita also has to observe the appropriate werewolf politics as she deals with the local werewolf pack.  Add in several of Richard's angry ex-girlfriends and a demon and you have one heck of a story!<BR>One thing I really enjoyed in this book was getting to know some of the secondary characters better.  We get to see a lot of Anita's wereleopards, Nathaniel, Cherry, and Zane, Jason and Jamil the werewolves, and two of Jean-Claude's vampires, Asher and Damian.  Though I liked the inclusion of these seven people as integral characters in the story, I couldn't help but miss Jean-Claude.<BR>\\"Blue Moon\\" is most definitely worth reading despite the problems I had with it, which are more due to my personal opinion than actual flaws in the story.  Hamilton has once again created a fast-paced and exhilarating tale that will completely absorb readers.  When you need to escape from your everyday troubles, Anita's wild world of vampires, werewolves and zombies is the perfect solution.  So don't miss out on the fun, buy this book (and all the others) ASAP, I guarantee you won't regret it!	2002-03-26

This addictive series will leave you craving more, until you've bought all 10 Anita Blake books regardless of whether you can afford them or not (it happened to me!).<BR>This instalment in the series finds Anita, hard-boiled necromancer, animator, and vampire executioner, enjoying her budding romance with Richard Zeeman, junior high science teacher and alpha werewolf.  But when she finds out that Richard is involved in a life and death struggle for leadership of the pack, she is furious with him for not telling her about it.  However, Anita doesn't have long to dwell on it because, as always, more trouble comes her way.<BR>The police beep Anita, requesting her expertise on a preternatural murder, but on her way to her car, Anita has a nasty run-in with Gretchen, one of Jean-Claude's vampires.  Gretchen is hopelessly in love with the incredibly sexy Master of the City, Jean-Claude, and she sees Anita the one thing standing between her and her true love.  Anita manages to get away, but not before Gretchen has promised to kill her!<BR>Anita finally makes it to the murder scene, where the deceased appears to be the victim of a lycanthrope attack.  Unfortunately, however, Anita has walked right into the middle of a police turf war between the local sheriff's dept. and her squad.  Guns are drawn and harsh words exchanged before they come to a tense agreement and allow Anita to see the body.<BR>Arriving home ready to end her night, Anita is forced into a meeting at the Lunatic Cafe with the current werewolf pack leader, Marcus.  Surrounded by dozens of other were-creatures, Anita doesn't feeltoo secure, but Marcus has a strange request for her.  Eight shapeshifters (lycanthropes) have disappeared recently, and Marcus wants Anita to find out what happened to them.  She reluctantly agrees to look into it, and quickly becomes entwined in the strange and violent world of lycanthrope politics.  <BR>The story really takes off from here, sending the reader on a fabulous adventure alongside Anita as she deals with the two men in her life, fights off Gretchen the jealous vampire, helps the police solve their murder, and tries to find eight missing lycanthropes.  <BR>With so many different things happening at once, one might think that the book would become confused and hard to follow, but Hamilton skilfully ties all the different threads together into one fantastic story.  Anita's adventures are always thrilling and suspenseful, sometimes quite sensual, and will keep readers glued to the pages.  <BR>Every visit with Anita and the gang is like a holiday to a magical new world, where you can forget all your troubles and get completely caught up in the alternate reality Hamilton creates so brilliantly.

Hamilton's new series revolving around Meredith NicEssus, a faerie princess of the Unseelie Court.  This book is a wonderful, sensuous read, full of rich and vivid characters in a thrilling storyline that will keep you turning pages all night long.  This is a very promising beginning to what seems to be another highly addictive series by LKH.<BR>Princess Meredith NicEssus has been hiding out in Los Angeles for three years under the name Meredith Gentry, working as a private detective specializing in the supernatural.  Merry is hiding because her aunt Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness, wants her dead (and being half-human, not full sidhe, Merry is  mortal and easily killed).<BR>When Merry takes a case involving faerie magic, she ends up the victim of a spell that destroys the careful disguise she creates using glamour, and the secret is out that Princess Meredith is in LA.  It doesn't take long for her aunt's guards to come searching for her, and after some suspenseful and exciting scenes, Meredith is finally forced to return home.  Luckily for Merry, however, she has finally come into her own power, inheriting the \\"hand of flesh\\" from her father, and making her a power to be reckoned with.<BR>But a surprise awaits her when she arrives home.  It seems that her aunt no longer wants her dead.  In fact, due to some unknown falling out with her unbalanced and cruel son, Merry's cousin Cel, Queen Andais gives Merry a chance to inherit the throne.  Whoever produces an heir first, Merry or Cel, will become the next ruler of the Unseelie Court, and Merry may have her pick of all the Queen's guards as lovers.<BR>This sounds great in theory, but the truth of it is that someone wants Merry dead, and she isn't home an hour before the first attempt on her life occurs.  Merry is nearly positive that it is her cousin Cel, trying to ensure that he inherits the throne, but the Queen always looks the other way for her only son, so Merry's lifeis left in extreme peril.<BR>Hamilton does a fantastic job of portraying the Unseelie Court, and all the politics that go along with it.  The Queen's guards are all fascinating characters, and I look forward to learning more about them in future books.  Doyle, the Queen's darkness, and the most feared of all the guards is my favourite.  His interactions with Merry are intriguing and skilfully rendered, and his commitment to her, to keep her safe, is quite touching.  The other guards, such as Frost (The Killing Frost), Rhys (once a death god), Barinthus and Galen, are also utterly loyal to Merry, and are all interesting characters who add depth to the story.<BR>Merry herself is a great character.  She is small and tough, like Anita Blake from Hamilton's Vampire Hunter series, but that is where the similarities end.  Merry is an innately sexual being, comfortable with her sexuality and not afraid to show it.  These views on Merry's part, and the inherently sexual nature of the fey, make for a lot of erotica in this novel, which I really enjoyed.  I found the sex scenes tasteful and highly sensual, not to mention essential to the telling of the story.  <BR>Once again Hamilton has created a new, magical world in which readers can immerse themselves.  Merry's world of breathtakingly beautiful and grotesque faeries, multi-eyed goblins, brownies and ghosts is wonderfully imaginative and hugely fun to read about.  I truly enjoyed this book and went into work completely bleary-eyed two days in a row, because I simply could not put this book down.  Hamilton is a wonderful storyteller, and this new series already has me hooked.  So don't miss out on the fun, buy this book today!	2002-03-18

Filled with biting wit, heart-pounding suspense, and passionate romance, this book is sure to please.<BR>Walter Pettibone's surprise birthday didn't turn out as planned.  At exactly 8:45pm, a server named Julie Dockport handed Walter a glass of champagne filled with cyanide.  The grieving family has no idea who this woman is, but Eve Dallas, hard-boiled Lieutenant in the NYPSD, does.  Ten years ago, Eve was on the team that brought Julie down for poisoning three husbands.  Released from jail for good behaviour, Julie is out for the ultimate rematch with Eve; planning to destroy all the lives she can before her grand finale, taking Roarke's life.<BR>But Eve is as feisty and as determined as ever, and she will do anything and everything to bring this woman down and protect what's hers.  As the two women hunt each other, suspenseful and thrilling scenes abound, but it's the final confrontation that takes the cake - it is wild!<BR>Eve and (her husband) Roarke's relationship is still as touching and passionate as ever.

I think Robb did a fantastic job on this book - I found myself laughing out loud at the witty repartee between characters, I cried watching Eve facethe nightmare of her past, and I caught myself biting my nails during the action.  What more could you want from a book?  <BR>After 14 novels in a series, you might think an author would lose her edge, but J.D. Robb proves that does not have to be true.  I was sucked into the year 2059 and the world of Eve and Roarke, and was enthralled right to the end.

There have been numerous vicious vampire murders in the city of St. Louis of late, and Nikolaos wants Anita to find whoever or whatever is responsible.

Jean-Claude is expertly portrayed by Hamilton - he's smooth-talking, a little wicked, and oh so sexy!  <BR>As Anita works desperately to solve the murders, with Nikolaos becoming more and more threatening, she begins to realize that her only way out of this whole mess is to kill Nikolaos.  Anita seeks the assistance of her \\"friend\\" Edward, a cold-blooded assassin, and together they concoct a plan to destroy Nikolaos. <BR>The suspense builds to a thrilling climax that will have readers on the edge of their seats.<BR>One complaint I have is that I would have liked \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" to have been longer, as it ended up being a very fast read (only 266 pages).

Hamilton elicited some mixed responses from me, but for the most part, I thought it was great.  I was captivated by the story, and barely put the book down until I was finished.  After reading an excerpt of this book in \\"Out of this World\\", I thought I would not buy it, but when I found it at a used bookstore, I decided to give it a try, and I have not regretted it! <BR>The story begins when Anita Blake, hard-boiled necromancer and vampire executioner (among other things), is called in to save two of her were-leopards from an S & M club where they are being held captive.  She seeks the help of her sometimes boyfriend, Master Vampire Jean-Claude, who she has not seen in 6 months.  Upon meeting her at the club, 'Narcissus in Chains', Jean-Claude insists that they must marry the marks that bind them together, so that Anita will have a chance of surviving this fight.  Richard, Anita's other sometimes boyfriend and werewolf king, arrives also, and three of them partake in a highly sensual and magical moment as they solidify the connection between them.<BR>While trying to save her were-leopards, Anita is seriously injured, and quite possibly infected with leopard lycanthropy.  When she regains consciousness, Anita finds that there is a new man in her life, when the Nimir-Raj of another were-leopard pack, Micah, comes to her aid.<BR>From this point on, things get violent and complicated for Anita, and Hamilton takes her readers on a wild and wonderful adventure alongside Anita.  There are a lot of new characters introduced and there were a couple of times where I had to stop reading and wrack my brain as to who this person was and why he had suddenly appeared again, which I found a little annoying.  Besides that, however, I liked many of the new additions, especially Micah and his pard.  <BR>Due to the marrying of the marks, Anita inherited lots of powers from Jean-Claude and Richard, but she was also given a curse - Jean-Claude's ardeur(his need to feed off lust).  Because of this, there is a lot of sex in this book, but I personally was not bothered by it.  I didn't feel that the plot was merely there as a vehicle for the sex scenes.  I thought the sex scenes were an integral part of the book, showing Anita's long overdue acceptance of what she really is.  Yes, the scenes were quite explicit, but I personally found them wonderfully sensual and erotic.  <BR>One complaint I have is that the Epilogue covered some issues in one or two lines that could have made up several enjoyable chapters, and several comments posed more questions than they answered.  None-the-less, when the book came to a close, I was sated and happy with my purchase. <BR>So, did I like \\"Narcissus in Chains\\"?  Yes.  Is it perfect?  No, but what book is?  <BR>The reason I read is because I love to be swept away into a different world for a few hours and not worry about anything else. This book did exactly that.  I was absorbed into Anita's weird and wild world and simply enjoyed being there.  If you go into \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" planning to look for all its flaws, you probably won't like it, but if you just suspend your disbelief and read it for pure enjoyment, just to get away for a few hours, you will love it like I did.	2002-03-05

Hamilton is an enthralling addition to the Anita Blake series. It is filled with expertly rendered horror and action sequences that will have readers nervously looking over their shoulders for days!<BR>In this 9th instalment of the series, Edward the cold-blooded assassin calls in the favour Anita owes him for killing one of his back-ups some time ago. Edward, alias Ted Forrester, needs Anita, tough-as-nails necromancer and vampire executioner, to come act as his back-up in a case that has him seriously spooked (and Edward being spooked is absolutely unheard-of!).  So, Anita packs her bags and travels to New Mexico.<BR>  Anita is horrified when she sees the gruesome and gory murder victims and the even more horrific \\"survivors\\".  Everyone is at a loss as to what would be capable of committing these atrocities.  In hope of gaining some insight into the case, Anita seeks the help of the local Master Vampire Itzpapalotl (English translation: Obsidian Butterfly), a self-proclaimed Aztec goddess.  From that point on, Anita runs into all kinds of nasty people and preternatural creatures, and readers are treated to some fantastic (and violent) action-adventure sequences. Anita is determined to stop whatever is committing these heinous crimes, and as she tries to do just that, she has to fight her way through many perilous situations. The non-stop conflict builds to a wonderfully simple but thrilling climax that is sure to satisfy readers.<BR>I really, really enjoyed this book. I thought it was a fascinating departure on Hamilton's part, though it is certainly not appropriate for the faint of heart. \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" provides a refreshingly different storyline and a very interesting up-close look at the inner workings of Edward. Edward is a highly intriguing character, and his contrasts and mysteries, along with the exciting storyline make the nearly 600 pages of this book fly by. I couldn't help but miss Jean-Claude a little, but the strengths in this story more than made up for his absence. Anita continues to grow and evolve as a person, and I think she is a fabulous character. \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" is truly wonderful entertainment, so don't miss out. It is suitable for first time readers of the series as well as long-time fans, and is sure to be enjoyed by all!	2002-03-04

When Raven revives beside her dead mother, she is overcome by grief, but follows her mother's instructions and travels to the New World to start a new life.<BR>However, danger awaits her at every turn, because there are Immortal Dark Witches as well, who survive by taking the hearts from Light Witches such as Raven.

The suspense builds effectively to a thrilling climax, and the ultimate battle between good and evil.<BR>\\"Eternity\\" is a book that will touch your heart.  Personally, I found it hard to read at times because of the cruelty that was directed towards Raven when she was suspected of witchcraft.

Indeed, with characters that make readers love them and a storyline that will keep readers enthralled, \\"Eternity\\" is a book that won't soon be forgotten.

She is also policing the local werewolf pack, acting as their lupa, despite her split with Richard, the pack's alpha.  In addition to this, Anita suddenly finds herself as the protector/leader of the local wereleopard pack (Anita killed their alpha, Gabriel, in an earlier novel).  <br />Then Anita's boyfriend Jean-Claude, the city of St. Louis' super-sexy Master Vampire, has his home invaded by the immensely powerful and frightening Vampire Council, the ruling body for all vampires.  Anita and Jean-Claude confront them together, and must defend themselves against wild accusations claiming that Jean-Claude is a threat to the hierarchy, planning to set-up his own rival council.  They also must explain how they were powerful enough to destroy a Council member some months ago. <BR> <BR>The Council members present, the Traveler, who inhabits the bodies of those around him, and Padma, Master of Beasts, and their many violent and twisted associates have been torturing and raping Jean-Claude's people.

This is a sweet tale of a North Pole elf named Holly Berry who just doesn't fit in, so she is sent on a special mission to fulfill an orphan's Christmas wish.  Holly is hired as nanny for the orphaned Natalie, who wrote to Santa asking for a wife for her \\"Unca Drew\\" so she could have a mommy.  Unbeknownst to Holly, she is the perfect woman for the job, and Natalie's Uncle Drew is starting to agree.  This is a truly lovely, fanciful story that will have you believing in magic!<br />Dee Holmes' \\"The Unexpected Gift\\" is by far the weakest story in this anthology, although it is still enjoyable.  Sabrina McKay and her young son are having their first Christmas since Sabrina's divorce.  Sabrina's son finds what he believes is a body in the front yard, but who turns out to be Sabrina's high school boyfriend, Zach Danforth.  Spending time in each other's company rekindles the flame between Sabrina and Zach, and together they find the true meaning of Christmas.  The problem with this story is that nothing really happens in it - there is no real conflict, no suspense, no nothing.  It is, however, a sweet story about the true spirit of Christmas.<br />Third is Susan Plunkett's \\"Christmas Promises\\", which is a really excellent story.  FBI Agent Jake Rimsa reunites with his ex-fiancé, Marne York on their way to a shared Christmas celebration.  Marne has changed dramatically from the rich, pampered girl Jake remembers into a fierce advocate of abused women.  When Marne is suddenly enlisted to help find a missing child, their holiday plans are put on hold.  As these two work together, it becomes painfully clear that Jack and Marne never stopped loving each other, but Marne is carrying around a painful secret that ended their engagement 4 years earlier and may destroy their chances for happiness now.  Marne and Jake are very well developed and intriguing characters, and the plot of this short story is fresh and exciting and will keep you turning pages.  <br />Saving the best for last, we have J.D. Robb's \\"Midnight in Death\\" which is fantastic.  We catch up with Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD as her Christmas is interrupted by murder.  Serial killer David Palmer, who Eve caught and locked away three years earlier has escaped, and is out for revenge against everyone who put him away, especially Eve.  He has already killed the judge who sentenced him, and Eve goes into overdrive trying to catch this madman before he gets to the other people on his hit list.  Eve's sexy billionaire husband Roarke is right by her side, helping with the case and keeping his `Darling Eve' safe.

Indeed, the story is especially fresh and thrilling and will keep you turning pages all night long.<br />In this instalment, Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD (in the year 2059) is tracking a killer who courts his victims in Internet poetry chat rooms.  Upon meeting his woman of choice, the killer slips a nasty date rape drug into her wine, takes her home and rapes her on a rose-petal strewn bed, then administers a final dose of drugs that proves fatal.<br />Eve is disturbed by this current case, as it dredges up memories of her own abused childhood.  But anyone who knows Eve Dallas knows that she will find justice for the dead no matter what, and she begins the process of tracking her killer.  The drugs administered to the first victim were valued at over a quarter of a million dollars, so who would have access to such a rare (virtually unheard-of) and expensive drug?<br />Eve is determined to stop the killer before countless more women are terrorized and killed, and when the opportunity arises, Eve decides to go undercover as bait in order to get her man!<br />I truly enjoyed the mystery Robb has crafted in this book.  She used a slightly different format this time, letting the reader know the killer's identity early on.  This in no way detracted from the suspense, however, as it was extremely exciting watching Eve put the clues together and come closer and closer to finding the killer.<br />As always, Eve and Roarke's relationship is fulfilling, passionate, and heart-warming.  It's wonderful to read about these two, and see their devotion to one another.  Robb has an immense talent for creating vivid and intriguing characters, and Eve and Roarke are two of her best ever.  The secondary characters such as Peabody, Eve's aide, the E-Detectives, Captain Feeney and Detective McNab, and many others, are equally vibrant and always lots of fun to readabout.  You will fall in love with all of them!<br />\\"Seduction in Death\\" is a suspenseful and well thought out book, containing Robb's brilliantly rendered characters, in a fascinating futuristic setting.  I guarantee this book and the entire rest of the series will entertain and satisfy you - so don't miss out!	2002-01-28

Puabi puzzles over the strange and tender new emotions she is feeling, and her romance with Matthew is fresh and passionate.  But things are not as they seem, and a dark force is looming close, waiting to destroy them.  Now Puabi and Matthew must pull together and fight for their newfound love!  I really enjoyed this story, and never once felt confused, even though it is the first piece by Shayne I have ever read.<br />Finally is Laurell Hamilton's &quot;Magic Like Heat Across My Skin&quot;, which is merely an excerpt from her newest book.  I think I enjoyed this the least.  I really liked Anita Blake, the necromancer, and her lovers Jean-Claude, the Master Vampire, and Richard the Alpha Werewolf.  I thought the dynamics between these three were great and that the magic of &quot;merging auras&quot; was fascinating.  However, at times Hamilton seemed to be more interested in describing the dominance and submission, sadism and masochism than in telling the story.  Perhaps this is supposed to be an important part of vampire/shape-shifter culture, and since I haven't read any of her books, I can't be sure, but it seemed excessive.  I was also highly frustrated by the way the story ended, with no resolution at all.  But then, I suppose that was the point, hoping that we will rush out and buy &quot;Narcissus in Chains&quot;.  Overall, the characters were interesting and well-written, and I found them very compelling, but I was irritated by the story's lack of resolution and its emphasis on disturbing sexual practices.<br />All-in-all, I really enjoyed &quot;Out of This World&quot;.  Robb's story was my favourite, and Krinard's and Shayne's stories really caught my interest.  Hamilton's 'excerpt' had some intriguing aspects, and though I will not buy &quot;Narcissus...&quot;, I may have a look at some of her earlier works, which are reputed to be much better.  Of course, my opinions won't be shared by all, due to the diverse range of genres included in this anthology.  This book provides a wonderful opportunity for readers to sample new authors, and I believe it is most definitely worth the read!	2002-01-16

Robb's &quot;In Death&quot; series, and this book might just be the best yet.  The world in 2058 is a fascinating place, but the real intrigue in this story lies in the characters.<BR>Robb has an amazing ability to paint vivid and realistic characters, and then explore those characters so that we, as readers, come to feel like we really know them.  This is exactly what has happened for me with Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke.  Each book delves a little deeper into these two, as individuals and as a unit, and I am completely addicted to reading about them.  In fact, I would say that Eve, the independent and emotionally troubled cop, and Roarke, the dangerously handsome and charming billionaire, are my favourite couple of all time!  Their relationship continues to grow and flourish as they adjust to their overpowering feelings for each other, and the passionate scenes they share all but send sparks from the pages!<BR>In this particular instalment, Eve is working a new case involving a twisted killer who commits unspeakable acts of torture on his victims (two so far) and then, after hours of torment, murders them.  In each case, the killer sends the police a taunting riddle, which Eve solves just too late to prevent the murder.  As Eve delves into the investigation, it becomes apparent that the link between the two victims is her husband, Roarke, and a dark secret from his past involving Summerset's murdered daughter.  Now Eve must walk the thin line between protecting her husband and finding justice for the dead, before another life is lost!<BR>This book will draw you in right from the start and keep you captivated until the end.  The plot is suspenseful, thrilling, and completely absorbing.  I highly recommend each and every book in this series, and this one will leave you craving many more visits with Eve and Roarke.  I guarantee it!	2002-01-15

Robb is the third instalment in the &quot;In Death&quot; series and it does not disappoint.  We continue to learn more about Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD and her billionaire fianc, Roarke.  The book is set in the year 2058, and though there are many cool new gadgets and technologies, human nature remains the same.  The futuristic setting adds a fresh new perspective, yet never detracts from the main storyline.<BR>In this book, Eve's flamboyant best friend, Mavis Freestone, has been accused of murdering a top model.  Eve is determined to find the true killer and prove Mavis' innocence, and so she goes into overdrive doing just that.  Eve turns up a connection to a new illegal drug, which benefits the user with restored youthfulness, but is also highly addictive and fatal!  Now it is up to Eve to connect the dots that lead to a killer, and save her best friend!<BR>This book is thrilling, suspenseful, fun, and full of great passion between Eve and Roarke.  Robb blends the romance with the suspense seamlessly and I am in awe of her ability to create vivid and true-to-life characters who become completely real to the reader.  Eve is a wonderfully strong woman, with a past full of dark and troubling secrets.  Roarke is the perfect match for her and getting to know these two has been a wonderfully rewarding experience.

Robb continues to impress me with her &quot;In Death&quot; series.  &quot;Ceremony in Death&quot; continues the tradition of excellence, providing an exciting, unsettling, and entertaining read.<BR>We receive new insight into the main characters, Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD and her charming billionaire husband Roarke, with each book in the series.  These two are a wonderful couple, and their dynamics become more complex and fascinating in this novel.  When Eve and Roarke are together the sparks fly, and they have some highly erotic, yet never distasteful scenes.<BR>In this instalment of the series, Eve is investigating a case that involves satanic cults and lots of deep, dark secrets.  The sinister atmosphere of this novel is expertly woven, causing Eve's encounters with evil to send chills up the reader's spine.  <BR>Although we know who the bad guys are pretty much from the beginning.  We do not have the mystery properly solved until the very end, and there are many thrilling and suspenseful scenes to keep the reader turning pages.  I truly enjoyed this book, and with its romance and suspense, its intrigue and futuristic police procedure, there is something in it for everyone!<BR>I am in awe of J.D. Robb's incredible skill at writing continually superior books and I will continue to buy and recommend them as long as she keeps writing them!	2002-01-09

I started reading Robb's books when I ran out of Nora Roberts books (literally, I read all the available titles) and I have NOT been disappointed.  I recommend these books to anyone and everyone because the seamless mix of genres (mystery, suspense, romance, police procedure, science-fiction) means there's something in these books for all types!<BR>In this book, newly married Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD and billionaire Roarke are interrupted on their off-planet honeymoon by an apparent suicide.  A young engineer working on Roarke's new resort (where E&amp;R were honeymooning) seems to have come home for the day, made a noose and hung himself.  However, the look on his face, one of utter rapture, disturbs Eve.<BR>Upon Eve's return to New York, two more apparent self-terminations occur, and after being present at one of them, Eve is quite sure that these are not what they seem.  Eve is thrown into the world of virtual reality and mind control, where your own mind can become someone else's weapon.  Eve is determined to find the murderer responsible for these deaths, but the closer she comes to the truth, the more danger she, and Roarke, are in!<BR>As always, Robb's mystery is thrilling and fun.  Eve and Roarke's romance continues to steam up the pages.  Eve and Roarke are among my favourite couples of all time - Eve's reluctant tenderness, Roarke's utter devotion to his &quot;Darling Eve&quot; and the mind-numbing passion and life-altering love they share make them fascinating to observe.  Getting to know Eve and Roarke has been a rewarding experience; one I plan to continue until there are no more books to read!  This book is fantastic.  So don't hesitate, buy the entire &quot;In Death&quot; series today (I'm up to book #10 and still am LOVING every one) - you won't regret it!	2002-01-07

I should be so lucky!<BR>Immediately the author's style seemed choppy and trite, and as I went on I became more and more annoyed by her excessive use of the exclamation point.  She turned about every third or fourth statement into an exclamation, which at most times was completely inappropriate.<BR>As well as this terrible grammar, Fran, the heroine, is dull and irritating, and her best friend Rosie, for whom she sets up this &quot;Valentine Vendetta&quot;, is truly awful.  Indeed Rosie turns out to be a lying, self-indulgent drunk who has NO redeeming virtues that would inspire such blind and misplaced loyalty from her friend Fran.  <BR>The one redeeming quality of this book is the hero, Sam Lockhart, who is handsome, mysterious, and full of good humour once you get below the surface.  But why this all-around good guy would fall for the uptight and dull heroine is truly beyond me.<BR>Anyway, I wish I had the 2 hours it took me to read this book back, ANYTHING I did would have been more productive.  So take my word for it and save yourself the frustration.	2002-01-04

One day, Johanna's uncle and legal guardian, Blaise Cheney, shows up for a visit and soon discovers how he has neglected his niece, who is fast becoming a young woman.  He plans to take Johanna with him to his home in France where she can make her debut into society.  Blaise then makes a very unorthodox offer to Flora, asking her to become his wife in name only for a two year period, during which time she will act as Johanna's mother.  Seeing it as a means of escape from her past in England, which appears to be closing in on her, Flora accepts, and thus begins her journey.  <BR>But neither Blaise nor Flora counted on falling in love.  In Blaise's chateau, Flora finds out about the terrible curse that has plagued the Cheneys for generations, and must deal with Blaise's interfering maiden aunt and a rather unfriendly maid.  But her love for Blaise knows no boundaries, and she finds herself swept away by her dashing new husband.<BR>But Blaise is hiding a shocking secret regarding the true reason for his deal with Flora.  Fate takes matters into its own hands before Blaise can explain things to Flora, and consequently she is devastated when she discovers the truth.  Will Flora be able to forgive Blaise for his betrayal?  And what other, perhaps more mystical forces are at work here?<BR>You'll have to read the book to find out, and it is most definitely worth the read.  &quot;The Mermaid's Song&quot; is an outstanding historical romance, with a healthy dose of the fanciful and a touch of suspense added to the mix.

I thought it was great. \\"Once Upon a Rose\\" contains four lovely tales of mythical lands and happily ever afters.<br />The first tale, \\"Winter Rose\\" by Nora Roberts, is fantastic.  Prince Kylar of Myrdon has been injured in battle, and wanders into a land cursed with eternal winter.  He is saved and nursed back to health by Deirdre, Queen of the Isle of Winter.  Deirdre is a healer and a hard-working queen, but the curse that has frozen her land has also frozen her heart, so she cannot love.  Kylar is fascinated by this dedicated and selfless queen, and vows to find a way to break the spell and win her heart.  This tale will delight readers!<br />\\"The Rose and the Sword\\" by Jill Gregory introduces Brittany, the long lost princess of Palladrin, who has been protected from the evil wizard Darius, who murdered her family many years ago, by a spell that will end on her 20th birthday.  Now, only a few days before that fateful day, Brittany's only chance is to seek out and marry her betrothed, Prince Lucius of Marric.  Lucius has a special jewelled sword, which raised with the hidden Rose Sceptre, can defeat Darius.  Lucius and Brittany must journey to find the Rose Sceptre together, or all will be lost.  When Brittany finds Lucius, he is in a sorry state of self-pity, and seems incapable of heroism.  But after only a short time in Brittany's company, love blooms in Lucius' heart and changes everything!<br />Ruth Ryan Langan's \\"The Roses of Glenross\\" is the weakest story in this anthology, although it is still an enjoyable read.  It is set in a war-torn Scotland, and begins with the courageous Jamie Morgan rescuing Alexa MacCallum from the barbarians who have just murdered her family.  Jamie and Alexa end up recuperating at the same abbey, but they both have huge emotional scars that will be hard to overcome.  Alexa speaks to no one at the abbey except for Lady Anne, the beautiful ghost who haunts the garden.  Alexa spends her days working tirelessly restoring the rosegarden to its former splendour, and Jamie finds himself fascinated by her.  Jamie is determined to get Alexa to befriend him, and these two soon find that the power of love heals all wounds.<br />\\"The Fairest Rose\\" by Marianne Willman is fabulous.  It is by far the longest of these four tales and is tied with \\"Winter Rose\\" as my favourite.  The evil sorceress Lady Bryn has captured the heart of newly appointed King Gilmore of Airan with a spell.  As a result, Gilmore forgets his true love, Deirdre, and years later has no idea that he has an 18 year old daughter, Rosaleen.  Rosaleen, called Mouse by all who know her, has been protected since birth by a spell cast by the village wisewoman, Elva, that all who would do her harm shall forget her.  Mouse works as a weaver in the castle, and has no idea of her royal heritage.  Tor, a great warrior, travels to Airan castle in hopes of winning the hand of the King's other daughter, Princess Camaris.  To do this, Tor must bring the egg of the legendary phoenix to the King, and only Mouse, who is madly in love with him, can help him on this quest.  But Tor can't stop thinking about Mouse, and his heart and his head are pulling him in opposite directions, which will he choose?  This is a wonderful tale that I guarantee all readers will love.<br />I truly enjoyed all the stories in this anthology, especially \\"Winter Rose\\" and \\"The Fairest Rose.\\" However, with a book such as this, certain stories will appeal to different individuals more than others. I do not believe that this book deserves a one or two star review, as all of the stories are well written with intriguing characters. I absolutely recommend this anthology - it is fun, fanciful, and utterly enchanting!	2001-12-17

The story is absorbing and well-written and contains a mix of fabulous, complex characters.<br />&quot;Sanctuary&quot; is the story of three siblings, Jo Ellen, Brian and Lexy Hathaway.  Jo Ellen is a successful photographer and a workaholic.  She suffers a nervous breakdown when she receives a photo from an anonymous sender of her mother, thought to have abandoned her family and run away with another man 20 years ago, looking young and beautiful, naked, and unmistakably dead.<br />When Jo Ellen is released from hospital she returns to Sanctuary Inn, her family home on an island off the coast of Georgia.  Jo Ellen sets about rebuilding her relationships with her brother Brian, the inn's chef, and her ever-jealous sister Lexy, an aspiring actress working as Sanctuary's waitress.  She is also looking for some stability and a place to regain her sanity.<br />Enter Nathan Delaney, who was with his family on the island the summer that Jo Ellen's mother disappeared.  Jo Ellen and Nathan are drawn to each other and develop a relationship.  But Nathan is tormented by a dark secret that has attracted a killer to the island and has put Jo Ellen in more danger than anyone suspects.<br />Add to the mix a romance between Brian and the pretty island doctor, Kirby, and a romance between Lexy and her long-time friend Griff, and you have the recipe for a highly entertaining book.  The suspense builds effectively and the clues provided will keep the reader guessing.  Jo Ellen and Nathan's romance, which is the main focus, is by turns sexy and moving.<br />I have noticed some complaints from reviewers who thought there were too many characters and storylines, but I personally never felt this was a problem.  Each storyline is fully developed and all of the characters have their motivations well explained.  I really enjoyed watching all three of the Hathaway siblings finding someone to love and depend on in the midst of the disturbing events taking place on their island.<br />&quot;Sanctuary&quot; is a fabulous, fun read, containing well-written romances and an exciting and suspenseful mystery.

In the first one, &quot;Courting Catherine,&quot; tomboy C.C. Calhoun meets Trenton St. James III.  C.C. is a mechanic and when she fixes Trent's car for him, she soon discovers that he's the man who is trying to buy her home, a wonderful but dilapidated mansion called The Towers, and turn it into a hotel.  C.C. immediately tells Trent just what she thinks of him, but as these two spend time together the sparks begin to fly.  This first story also introduces the mystery of the missing emeralds belonging to Bianca Calhoun, great-grandmother of the 4 Calhoun sisters.  This is a lovely romance with an intriguing mystery added to the mix.<BR>The second story, &quot;A Man for Amanda,&quot; tells Amanda Calhoun's story.  C.C. and Trent are now an item, and they have decided to turn one wing of The Towers into a special getaway, while keeping the rest of the home for the family.  Enter Sloan, the architect Trent has hired for the renovations.  His first meeting with Amanda doesn't go too well, but he finds himself completely taken with the obsessively organized and beautiful Mandy.  The romance between these two is wonderfully written - when they aren't steaming up the windows they are arguing and taking shots at each other.  However, Amanda soon discovers that she can't live without this handsome southern gentleman and wonders how she managed to lose her heart to him.  The unbalanced and dangerous thief, Livingston, who is intent on stealing the Calhoun emeralds for himself, is introduced in this book.  He causes all kinds of trouble (and danger) for the Calhouns.<BR>C.C. and Amanda's stories are sure to please readers.  Nora Roberts does a fantastic job of weaving the present day romances with the mystery of the emeralds and tying them to the long-ago story of theunhappily married Bianca Calhoun and her true love Christian.

After several days of recuperation, Max begins working with the Calhouns in an attempt to recover the emerald necklace.  Max finds the stunning Lilah quite a distraction.  The steamy romance Max and Lilah share will keep readers turning pages.  Readers will love our hero Max, the bookish professor with a heart of gold.  Lilah, a wonderfully strong and determined heroine, will also win readers over.  The mystery of the emeralds and the havoc that the evil Livingston causes add some fun and excitement to the romance and make for a truly enjoyable read.<br />&quot;Suzanna's Surrender&quot; is the best of the series.  The heartbreaking story of Bianca, the original mistress of &quot;The Towers,&quot; and her lover Christian has been told throughout the Calhoun series.  In this fourth book, the Calhouns track down Christian's grandson, Holt Bradford, and ask for his help in finding the emeralds.  When Suzanna goes to speak with Holt, he is rude and uncooperative at first.  Holt has always thought of Suzanna as the beautiful princess in the tower who is way out of his league.  However, the attraction is very strong from Suzanna's side as well and they end up acting on their powerful feelings.  Suzanna has two young children to care for, and has had her faith in herself as a woman destroyed by her cruel ex-husband.  Fortunately, Holt is just the man to help herout.  Holt is a wonderful hero.  His prickly exterior covers a generous and caring man.  Holt's relationship with Suzanna's children will touch your heart. <BR>With the help of Holt, the Calhouns come closer and closer to finding Bianca's emeralds.  But the dangerous Livingston is close by, and will stop at nothing to possess them himself.  <BR>This book provides a satisfying end to the mystery of the emeralds.  It also contains characters that you will really come to care about and a romance that will leave you feeling fulfilled.<br />One note of warning though - I suggest you read these books in order, &quot;Catherine and Amanda&quot; and then &quot;Lilah and Suzanna,&quot; as the story of Bianca and the story of the emeralds builds from one book to the next.  Overall, I highly recommend the Calhoun stories, they are great!	2001-12-11

Together, in the culmination of a thousand year spell, these two must fight an evil sorcerer who can only be conquered by true love.  Calin must return Bryna's love freely, or the evil sorcerer will triumph and all will be lost.  This is written in true NR style and will have readers captivated.<br />Next is Jill Gregory's &quot;Castle Doom,&quot; in which Arianne sets out on a mission to save her brother Marcus from his evil captor, Julian.  She finds an ally in Nicholas, an old friend of her brother, and together they must fight the evil Julian in order to save Marcus and free the people from his tyranny.  In the midst of their dangerous plight, Arianne and Nicholas unexpectedly fall in love.  This story was suspenseful and romantic and highly entertaining.<br />In &quot;Falcon's Lair&quot; by Ruth Ryan Langan, Felicity travels from her home in America to Ireland to help Oliver, an old friend of her father, with a terrible curse.  Something is not quite right in this majestic old castle and Felicity finds help from a handsome spirit (Gareth).  With Gareth's help Felicity begins to see that this home is filled with betrayal and sets out to save Oliver and his son.  However Gareth and Felicity fall in love and break the rules that govern Gareth to be together, for which there will be dire consequences.  This story will touch your heart and leave you believing in magic.<br />The final story is &quot;Dragonspell&quot; by Marianne Willman and I think this one was my favourite (it's just so hard to choose because they are all so good!).  Princess Tressalara, with the help of 2 sorcerer's apprentices and a dashing and dangerous rebel named Cador, sets out to reclaim her kingdom from the evil usurper, Lector.  Tressalara joins Cador's rebelcamp originally as Trev, a young boy, but Cador immediately sees beneath her plain clothes and dirty face to the beautiful woman beneath.  Cador and Tressalara fall head over heels in love with each other and enjoy a wonderful romance that readers will love.  This tale will sweep you away to the magical land of Amelonia and leave you feeling fulfilled and satisfied.<br />This is an absolutely superior anthology.  If you enjoy a good &quot;happily ever after&quot; and a bit of magic then you will LOVE this book.  All four stories are well-written and lots of fun.  You will be sad to see this one come to an end!	2001-12-10

Both are wonderfully romantic and fun-filled visits with one of NR's most beloved families.<br />The first book, &quot;Playing the Odds,&quot; begins Daniel MacGregors legacy of matchmaking.  Comanche gambler Justin Blade meets the violet-eyed Serena working in the casino on his vacation cruise.  These two are immediately and undeniably drawn to each other.  Only later does Justin discover that this feisty woman is Rena MacGregor, daughter of his business associate Daniel MacGregor, who encouraged him to take the cruise in the first place.  Serena tries to resist Justin's advances, but something about him keeps her coming back for more.

Serena and Justin just can't stay away from each other and a sizzling romance ensues.  Justin and Serena are a perfect match for each other, and readers will fall in love with both of them.  Of course, true love conquers all and these two overcome everything that stands in their way to be together.<br />In the second book, &quot;Tempting Fate,&quot; Serena invites Justin's estranged sister, Diana, to visit them.  Diana remembers Justin only as the big brother who abandoned her and left her to be raised by her cold and uncaring aunt.  As a result, she keeps all her emotions buried deep inside and presents a very cool, detached woman to those around her.  Serena's handsome brother, Caine, picks Diana up from the airport and is immediately fascinated by this cool and collected beauty.  Caine and Diana have much in common, as they soon discover they are both lawyers and both attended Harvard.  In fact, Diana has heard all about Caine MacGregor, the notorious playboy, and Caine must work at convincing Diana that his reputation is far exaggerated.  <BR>When Diana discovers the truth about what happened with her brother all those years ago, she realizes she has made a terrible mistake about him.  All of Diana's realizations about her life bring her emotions to the surface, and it is Caine who she turns to for comfort.  As Caine earns Diana's trust and admiration, he discovers the passionate and loving woman beneath her icy exterior.  Diana and Caine are a lovely couple and readers will truly enjoy the romance they share.<br />Although &quot;Serena-Caine&quot; is a relatively light read, if you approach it as what it is meant to be, a fun and romantic escape, you will most definitely enjoy it.	2001-12-10

Michael is concerned that he is becoming too attached to Laura and her daughters, because he feels that he isn't good enough for them and can't possibly keep them in his life. <BR>As Michael romances Laura, he shows her feelings and desires she didn't even know she had.

This is done for the benefit of people like me who have only recently discovered this exceptional author.  It does not say &quot;first time in print&quot; as all of her new books do, and I personally think that finding these older books is like finding a wonderful gift.  So to avoid any confusion, just make sure that you check the copyright dates before you buy a book if you do not want to buy a previously published one.<BR>Anyway, these two books were great!  The first book introduces Lindsay Dunne.  Lindsay is an extremely talented ballerina, but she has left the spotlight and returned home to care for her mother after a debilitating accident.  Lindsay keeps busy teaching dance and caring for her mother.  Seth Bannion, a famous architect, arrives in town with his recently orphaned niece, Ruth.  Seth and Lindsay create all kinds of sparks when they are together, not all of them good, but they both find each other irresistible!  Ruth begins ballet lessons with Lindsay, and Lindsay immediately recognizes her incredible talent.  As Lindsay tries to convince Seth that Ruth needs to go away to dance school it creates a rift between them that may ultimately tear them apart!<BR>This is a wonderful story of finding love and following your dreams.<BR>The second book meets up with Ruth several years later, dancing at one of the best dance companies in the country with her mentor and Lindsay's former partner, Nick Davidov.  This temperamental and gifted man is a delightful character.  His relationship with Ruth is exciting, emotional and very original.  This tale will have the reader captivated.  Ruth and Nick are two of the most memorable characters I have ever met and I am confident that you will enjoy their story as much as I did.<BR>You don't have to like ballet to love this great 2-in-1 publication, and I guarantee you will love these characters.  So read this book and enjoy!	2001-12-06

I thought it was smart, provocative, and fun.  So please, don't turn down this book because of the negative reviews.  Whatever its faults, I firmly believe that its strengths make up for them.<BR>This is a lovely sweeping tale of three generations of passionate women and the men who love them.  When &quot;La Signora&quot; (Tereza Giambelli) decides to merge the Giambelli winery with her husband Eli's MacMillan winery, the company is thrown into turmoil.  Tereza's granddaughter, Sophia, head of public relations and advertising is no more pleased about the merge than Eli's grandson, Tyler MacMillan, who is in charge of the vines and the distilling process.  &quot;La Signora&quot; decrees that Tyler and Sophia must work together, and that each must learn to do the other's job.  Although neither is enamoured with the idea, they get down to work, only to find out that they have a powerful attraction to each other, which is hard to keep under control.  <BR>Sophia's mother, Pilar, has let herself be a doormat for Sophia's deadbeat father, Tony Avano, for years.  After years of separation, Tony finally asks for a divorce so that he can remarry.  But Avano does not enjoy his marriage for long, as he is found murdered in Sophia's apartment.  Poison is found in bottles of Giambelli wine, which throws the company into upheaval.  Someone is trying to destroy the Giambelli-MacMillan winery, and the race is on to find out who.  <BR>Amidst this murder and mayhem, Tyler and Sophia's relationship heats up, but Sophia isn't the only one with a new romance.  The new COO of Giambelli-MacMillan, David Cutter, finds himself quite taken with Pilar.  David begins to win Pilar's trust as he heals a lifetime of her emotional hurt and Pilar attempts to win over David's two teenagers.  Their romance is touching and complex, while Sophia and Tyler's romance is exciting and fresh.<BR>To sum up, this is a suspenseful, witty, and fun-filled book and I found it very enjoyable.  Many reviewers felt that there were too many characters for any to be developed fully, but that is just not true.  All of the characters are distinct and have their motivations and feelings well explained.  The many characters involved added depth to the story and I thought this was a refreshing new angle for Nora Roberts to use.  This book will entertain and satisfy you if you just enjoy it for what it is and stop looking for faults.	2001-12-06

Byron's support and faith in Kate help her get through these tough times.  Laura and Margo, Kate's two best friends, show her unwavering loyalty, and the friendship these three share is the foundation of this entire trilogy.

She has lived with Laura Templeton, the daughter of the wealthy and powerful Templetons and Kate, Laura's orphaned cousin nearly all of her life.  Margo manages to make a name for herself, using her stunning good looks, in the modeling world, but she returns home after a scandal destroys her career.<BR>Many reviewers have criticized Margo for being a selfish and unlikeable character.  I have to disagree.  Although she does have quite an ego, she is also an excellent and loyal friend who would do ANYTHING for Laura and Kate.  This book is about Margo's growth as a person and her self-discovery.  A character without flaws is just plain unrealistic, and Margo's faults only make her seem more human.<BR>The romance that blooms between Margo and Laura's brother Josh is truly lovely.  Margo and Josh have been in love with each other for the better part of both of their lives, although neither of them was aware of the others feelings.  The tale of these two finally finding each other was quite captivating.<BR>Despite Josh's riches and trust funds, he is a generous, hard-working man and a very likeable hero.  Margo and Josh are really great together and the reader is treated to some wonderfully sexy scenes.<BR>This book starts an absolutely fabulous trilogy, and it is most definitely worth reading.  So don't listen to the negative reviews, just enjoy these characters for who they are and join them on their journey to find true love!	2001-12-04

To top it off, MJ isn't talking, not even when Jack discovers that she has one of the three Stars of Mithra in her purse (a huge blue diamond).<BR>The chemistry between Jack and MJ is highly entertaining and they are both wonderful strong characters.

And Seth figures Grace is just a spoiled and selfish little rich girl.  But as Seth gets to know her, he realizes that Grace is not at all what she seems.

NR's writing has reached new levels of excellence in this provocative romance.  This book held me from the minute I picked it up, and I couldn't put it down until it was done.  <br />Ripley Todd is happy with her quiet life on Three Sisters working as a sheriff's deputy.  She enjoys life without complications, which is made difficult for her by the fact that she has incredible powers that confuse and frighten her.  She has become great friends with Nell, who has just married her brother, Zack, and remains at odds with Mia Devlin, her childhood friend and the island's known witch.  <br />When MacAllister Booke arrives on Three Sisters to research the stories of witchcraft, Ripley originally scoffs at him and his work.  But Ripley's tough exterior doesn't prevent Mac from falling head over heels for her.  Nor can Ripley deny that she feels something powerful for this handsome researcher.  In addition to their intense attraction, Mac senses and soon confirms that Ripley is no ordinary woman.  He is fascinated by her struggle to deny the power that she holds inside her and embarks on a journey to help her accept who she is.<br />When Mac and Ripley are together the scenes really sizzle.  There are a number of highly sexy scenes that these two share, but their romance is also quite touching.  As these two fall in love, the walls Ripley has built up around herself begin to fall down.

In order to fight this centuries old evil that threatens their island, Ripley must embrace her power and come together with Mia and Nell before it's too late!<BR>  <BR>This is one of the best books I have ever read.

This story revolves around Ethan and his relationship with Grace Monroe.  Ethan has had perhaps the most disturbing past of the three boys adopted by Ray and Stella Quinn, but he has managed to become a wonderful, caring man and successful fisherman.

This story is full of love and sadness, romance and fulfillment, as Grace and Ethan finally come together.  It is a truly touching and lovely story, and is probably my favorite of the three.<BR>Seth's story is also continued in this installment, as his mother begins to pose more of a threat to him.

Although it is one of her less reality based stories, her ability to draw the reader into the world she has created stops this from being an issue.  The two main characters are likeable and well-developed and the story is full of excitement.  This book kept me turning pages half the night!<BR>The beginning of the book is incredibly heart-rending and upsetting.  The reader is introduced to Phoebe Spring, an american actress who has left her world behind to live with the man she loves, Abdu, in his native country of Jaquir (a fictitious Muslim country).  When Phoebe gives birth to a girl and subsequently finds out she can no longer bear children, Abdu decides that he no longer has any use for her.  He takes away the &quot;Sun and the Moon&quot; a priceless necklace containing a giant pearl and diamond, that was his bride gift to Phoebe.  Abdu takes more wives and regularly beats and rapes Phoebe.  On top of that, King Abdu despises Princess Adrianne, his first-born child, because she is a girl and because she came from Phoebe.<BR>When Adrianne is 8 years old, Phoebe risks life and limb to escape from Jaquir and give Adrianne a life of freedom in America.  Phoebe tries to return to a career in acting, but Abdu has broken her spirit and she suffers from terrible depression until she eventually dies from an overdose of pills and alcohol.  This part of the story is very well-written. <BR>We pick up the story with Princess Adrianne as an adult (in her twenties) living a life of glamour as a prominent figure in society.  But this is just a front to cover up the fact that she is really a master jewel thief.  Princess Adrianne then meets Phillip Chamberlain, a retired jewel thief who now works as an investigater for Interpol.  The relationship that develops between these two is fresh and heart-warming, and as they learn to trust each other their scenes together really sizzle!<BR>But Adrianne has never forgotten herfather's cruelty to her mother and plans to get the ultimate revenge on him by stealing the &quot;Sun and the Moon&quot;, his most prized possession.  Together, Phillip and Adrianne travel to Jaquir to bring justice to Phoebe by punishing Abdu for his brutality.  But their mission is the most dangerous either has ever embarked on, and any mistake will mean death for both of them!<BR>This book is a great read.  It is full of adventure and romance, and really keeps the reader's attention.  So pick up this book, forget your troubles for a few hours, and get completely wrapped up in the lives of Adrianne and Phillip as they take their Sweet Revenge!	2001-11-21

I could not put it down and finished it in less than a day.  Honestly, I can't understand how the people who gave mediocre or negative reviews of this book can have been reading the same book.  This book has shot straight to the top of my list of Nora Roberts favorites - it is SO good.<BR>I found the story completely and utterly captivating.  Declan Fitzgerald has been obsessed with Manet Hall in New Orleans for 11 years.  When he hears it has come up for sale, he buys it right away and leaves his job, fianc, and family behind in Boston to move in and restore the hall to its former grandeur.  Declan soon discovers that he is not alone in Manet Hall, as several ghostly presences make themselves known.  Declan has strange visions and feelings of complete terror associated with certain rooms.  Declan also meets Lena Simone, a stunningly beautiful, and fiercely independent bar owner.  The attraction is instant and mutual.  But there's something more than that, a kind of recognition deep inside.  The relationship that develops betweeen these two was wonderfully written and very real.<BR>The flashbacks to the past, and the story of the doomed love of Abigail and Lucian, are a wonderful and heartbreaking addition to this story. The history adds to the main storyline, rather than confusing it or detracting from it.  Some of these sections had me in tears.<BR>The supporting characters are all wonderfully written.  For example, Miss Odette, Lena's grandmother is a lovable and colourful character.  And Lilibeth, Lena's mother, is so vile and amoral she makes your skin crawl.<BR>But it's the story of Lena and Declan that kept me turning pages.  In order for these two to find happiness with each other, they must uncover the horrible events that took place a hundred years ago and come to terms with them.  Until they do that there is no chance for Declan and Lena, but what they uncover may tear them apart!<BR>I could go on forever about how much I love this book, but instead of doing that I'll simply suggest that you read it yourself, you won't be disappointed!	2001-11-13

Well, I only discovered Nora Roberts about a year ago, and since then I have read every book of hers I can get my hands on.  However, Nora's older works are incredibly tough to find, so I really appreciate it that they have re-issued some of her older works so that I can enjoy them all these years later.<BR>Personally, I really enjoyed the three stories that make up &quot;From the Heart&quot;.<BR>The first story, &quot;Tonight and Always&quot; was probably my favorite of the three.  Kasey, a renowned anthropologist, comes to work for Jordan, a successful author, in order to help him write his latest book.  Kasey is a wonderful and lovable character.  She is eccentric, energetic, and compassionate.  Jordan is a dashingly handsome hero, who learns a whole lot about himself from the outgoing and outspoken Kasey.  The romance between these two is fresh and fun.  Jordan is also the guardian of his deceased brother's 11 year old daughter, and her incorporation into this story added a whole other element to it.  I thought the storyline involving Jordan, his niece, and Kasey was touching and well-written.<BR>The second story, &quot;A Matter of Choice&quot; introduces the reader to Slade and Jessica.  Slade, a cop, has been assigned to protect Jessica from the smugglers who the police believe are operating out of her antique shop.  Slade thinks Jessica is going to be just another spoiled rich girl, but it only takes one meeting to change Slade's view completely.  This story is lots of fun and is full of murder and mayhem! <BR>The final story &quot;Endings and Beginnings&quot; is about two reporters, T.C. Thorpe and Liv Carmichael.  These two keep stepping on each others toes professionally, but they soon find it hard to deny their attraction to each other.  The romance in this story does not develop as quickly as in the previous two stories because Liv has a painful past that she has still not gotten over.  Thorpe, however, is a wonderful hero, and his patience and understanding with Liv show just how sweet he really is.  <br />These aren't serious, heavy stories, but they are fun and entertaining and I think they are most definitely worth reading.  So sit back, relax, and enjoy!	2001-11-07

The story takes place around the time of the ill-fated battle of Colloden, at a time when Scotland and England were very politically unstable.  The main characters, Serena and Brigham, are fabulous.  Serena is no typical woman of her time, she is a wonderfully strong character, off-set perfectly by Brigham, the British Lord who walks into her life one day holding her wounded brother in his arms.  The history of this story was rich and fascinating, and the love story between Serena and Brigham was unlike any other I have read.  There was NEVER a dull moment in this book.  The supporting characters in this book, such as Serena's parents - Fiona and Ian MacGregor, Serena's siblings - Coll, Gwen, and Malcolm, Brigham's valet - Parkins, etc. are very well-developed and all play an important role in the story.  The reader can't help but become fond of all of these supporting characters.  I was swept along by the story that unfolds in this book and could not put it down until it was done.  This book is a very satisfying read, well-written and full of romance and excitement.  So, pick this book up if you can find it, it is well worth your while!	2001-11-07

I have noticed a lot of criticism regarding Daniel's chauvanistic ways, but I thought it was an important part of the story to show that Daniel had to change his views and grow as a person in order to find happiness with the feisty Anna Whitfield.  &quot;For Now, Forever&quot; is a lovely romance and I found it to be both touching and amusing.  &quot;In From the Cold&quot;, the second story in this book, goes back a few hundred years to tell the story of one of Daniel's ancestors, Ian MacGregor.  I thought this story was wonderful!  Ian and Alanna made a great pair and I really enjoyed the historical aspect of it.  I would have happily read a much longer story about these two, but as it was it was still great!	2001-10-30

It is the first in Nora Robert's series about the Gallaghers of Ardmore.  This first installment introduces the reader to the oldest brother, Aidan, who has taken over the family pub.  Aidan is a great, well-developed hero.  Jude Murray arrives in Ireland feeling lost and alone.  She soon finds that her pretty little cottage and the village of Ardmore are fast becoming home to her.  The story Nora weaves is completely enthralling.  I could not put this book down.  I loved watching Jude and Aidan come together, and it was also great seeing Jude grow as a person and gain confidence in herself.  The fantasy elements of the book are just fabulous.  The story of Carrick, prince of the faeries, and Gwen, the lovely ghost who haunts Jude's cottage is touching and compelling.  This book is great all-around, and I highly recommend reading it, as well as the two that follow.	2001-10-30

Gallery owner Rogan Sweeney takes an interest in Maggie's fabulous glass creations, and soon after takes a personal interest in Maggie herself.  Maggie is a wonderful character, stubborn and flawed, yet still caring.  Nora does a fabulous job of developing Maggie, and does it in a way that she seems like a real person.  Rogan is an extremely likeable hero.  Maggie's sister, Brianna, is her complete opposite; quiet, sweet, and calm.  The relationship between the two sisters, however, is very touching and very real.  This book is full of colourful characters, some we love and some we hate.  The romance between Rogan and Maggie is wonderful.  Basically, I just can't say enough good things about this book.  You will love it!	2001-10-30

Kelsey &amp; Gabe are great main characters, both well-developed and likeable.  <BR>Kelsey has been told for her entire life that her mother died when she was a child, but she finds out differently one day when a letter shows up from her supposedly deceased mother!

Kelsey has to deal with her family's strong disapproval, especially from her grandmother, but decides that she really must meet the woman who gave her life.  Kelsey arrives on the farm and slowly begins to bond with her mother and the handsome man who owns the neighbouring farm, Gabe.  This story is full of betrayal, sabotage, romance, and excitement.  Overall, a highly enjoyable read.	2001-10-29

The story between the beautiful and flirtatious Darcy and the american businessman Trevor is fresh and fun.  I also have truly enjoyed the subplot of Gwen and Carrick, prince of the faeries, which was finally resloved in this final installment.  It was great to watch Darcy grow as a person and realize that finding a man with money was not going to be the answer to her happiness - that she would rather have love than riches.  Trevor was a well-developed and enjoyable hero.  All-in-all, this is a great read, as were the other two books in the trilogy, and I highly recommend it.	2001-10-26

It is always enjoyable for me to have a visit with the MacGregor family, but these two stories could stand alone on their own merit, even if the characters weren't members of one of my all time favorite families. <BR>Shelby and Alan's story is full of fun and romance. These two are complete opposites, Alan so dignified and tactful and Shelby so flamboyant and outspoken, but they soon find out that opposites really do attract and it's lots of fun to watch them come together.<BR>Grant and Gennie's story had me enthralled. Just the scenery alone is magnificent, but when it's added to the tumultuous romance between Grant and Gennie it makes the story a knock-out! Grant is a loner who chooses to live miles away from civilization, but when beautiful Gennie must seek refuge in his lighthouse during a storm, Grant's entire world is turned upside down, with steamy results!<BR>So, if you are looking for a few hours of pure enjoyment, it is more than worth your while to get this book.	2001-10-25

The book tells the story of three cousins, Morganna, Sebastion, and Anastasia, who just happen to be witches.  Each of the three stories is filled with fun, romance and just the right dose of fantasy.  The three cousins certainly don't have it easy as they try and explain their special powers to the people they are beginning to love.  These stories are touching and funny.  If you want to curl up in bed or by the fire, this is one of the best books you could have with you.  It is a nice light read and is also very tough to put down.	2001-10-24

This book is about three very different sisters who have never met each other before, who must live together for a year on their father's ranch in order to each receive their inheritance.  This story could easily have become typical, boring and hokey, but Nora keeps the reader on their toes and makes the characters seem very realistic.  The reason I'm not giving this book 5 stars is that there are some rather graphic and disturbing scenes that I could have done without.  I also would have preferred it if the story had concentrated on all three sisters equally - Willa gets most of the book to herself and I personally wanted to see more of Lily and Tess.  None-the-less this book is a worth-while and very satisfying read.	2001-10-24

I always love Nora's series because we get to revisit old friends.  In this case we are reunited with Travis and Dee from \\"Irish Thoroughbred\\", Nora's first book. This story, however, is about Travis and Adelia's daughter, Keeley Grant.  \\"Irish Rebel\\" is full of fun and romance and it keeps the reader's full attention from beginning to end.  <BR>Keeley's parents, Travis and Dee, the owners of the renowned racing stable \\"Royal Meadows\\" have just hired a new horse trainer, Brian Donnelly.  Brian has come all the way from Ireland to work for the Grants because he has a remarkable gift for training champions. <BR>When Brian first arrives, he believes that Keeley is a spoiled princess who has never had to work for anything, but he couldn't be more wrong.  Keeley is a strong-willed and compassionate woman who teaches under-privileged and abused children to ride.  <BR>Brian and Keeley grate on each other's nerves, but they can't deny the powerful attraction they share.  Keeley has never had much time for men in her life, and has never found a man who could hold her attention, but with Brian she seems to have met her match.<BR>As Brian discovers more and more about who Keeley really is, he finds himself falling in love with her.  Now this Irish rebel, who has spent his life moving from one place to another, wonders if it's finally time to stop running and put down some roots.  Will love triumph and keep Brian at Keeley's side?  <BR>You'll just have to read the book to find out!<BR>\\"Irish Rebel\\" is a truly entertaining and enjoyable read.  The romance between Keeley and Brian is fresh and passionate, and all of the characters are richly portrayed and very likeable.  This is a wonderful and well-written romance and I guarantee that you will love it like I did.  You will get more out of \\"Irish Rebel\\" if you have read \\"Irish Hearts\\", which contains the two previous books in this series, but it can easily stand alone.  Sosit back, relax, and enjoy this fantastic book!<BR>I hope that Nora Roberts will write the stories of Travis and Dee's other children very soon.	2001-10-24

It is the second book in the trilogy of the Gallagher siblings of Ardmore, Ireland and it is NOT to be missed!  Rich and vivid characters, gorgeous settings, a heart-warming romance, and just the right dose of fantasy all combine to make for a superb reading experience.<BR>Shawn Gallagher has spent his entire life moving at his own relaxed speed, daydreaming along the way.  He is an extremely talented musician and songwriter, but he has never put his gifts to good use.  This handsome man is content working as cook at his family's pub and writing songs for his own benefit.  However fiery-haired tomboy Brenna O'Toole, who has known Shawn nearly all her life, can't comprehend why he lets his immense talent go to waste.  Shawn and his daydreaming are a constant frustration to Brenna, who has had a secret crush on Shawn for years.<BR>Shawn has always treated Brenna like a little sister, which she has had just about enough of.  So, Brenna finally decides to confess her true feelings to Shawn.  This particular scene in the book is absolutely hilarious. <BR>From this point on, Shawn and Brenna begin their romance.  They have many obstacles to overcome, and their romance is full of ups and downs, passion and tenderness.  Shawn and Brenna are both wonderful, lovable characters, and readers will come to care deeply for them.  Roberts skilfully renders Shawn and Brenna's courtship, making their relationship so interesting that readers will be hard pressed to put this book down!<BR>Another fascinating part of the story that will keep readers glued to the pages is the subplot of Carrick, prince of the faeries, who must help all three Gallagher siblings find true love in order to break a centuries-old spell that keeps him from his one and only love, Lady Gwen.  Roberts does a fantastic job of incorporating these fantasy elements into the story and Carrick and Gwen's heart-breaking tale enriches the entire book.<BR>\\"Tears ofthe Moon\\" is one of my favourite Nora Roberts books ever.  The interaction between the three Gallagher siblings, Aiden, Shawn and Darcy, will warm your heart and make you laugh.  This is a beautiful and highly satisfying tale that you won't soon forget.  So buy this book today.  It is a magical read and I highly recommend it, along with the other two books in the series.	2001-10-23

I have nothing but good things to say about it.<BR>I am a big Nora Roberts fan, but I still always approach each book objectively, and the bottom line is, this book was highly enjoyable.<BR>Both stories are romantic and quite funny at times.  I found myself laughing out loud at Caleb and Jacob's reactions to the twentieth century.  <BR>I certainly wouldn't call this novel one of Nora's very best, but it was original and it was lots of fun to read.  I did not get bored by it, nor did I find the love scenes too long.  <BR>So don't listen to all these critical people, just sit back, relax, and join Libby &amp; Caleb and Sunny &amp; Jacob on their incredible journey through time to find true love.	2001-10-11
