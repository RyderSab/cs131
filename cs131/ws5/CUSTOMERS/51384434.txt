As a national workshop leader Glenn combines his own experience as a business owner with the experiences and research from more than 100,000 managers from Forture 500 companies and small businesses alike.  The author writes in a very straight forward manner -- and I like how he does not pull punches with addressing difficult employee behavior issues.
