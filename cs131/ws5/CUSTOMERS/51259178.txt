It  is incredibly entertaining for both the children (young AND old) and  myself. After reading it once, its almost guaranteed that you'll be reading  it again and again, it never gets tiring! Kids will be rolling on the floor  w/laughter after reading this! Not only is this book really fun, it teaches  a really good lesson! Just because Tacky is and odd bird, it doesn't stop  him from being a hero. This will teach kids that they can be proud to be  themselves! I definitely, definitely reccommend this book to anyone who is  around kids!	2000-08-08

Okay, I'll start by saying that this book is definitely blunt. But... in  honesty, as embarrassing as a lot of the information is, its very useful  and helpful. Being a teenager myself, I think that every teenage girl can  benefit from this book. My mom skimmed through it a little with me and she  thought that although some parts were unesecary, she felt it important that  I knew the majority of what was in it. It really answers a lot of questions  that you may be too scared to ask. I really recommend it for teenage girls  (probably the older, the better!)	2000-08-08

Being a teenager I enjoyed this book 1000x over! I constanly found myself smiling and recalling moments when I too, might have found my Sex God!

I found Jenna's character very easy to identify to, being a teenager myself. <br />Although she may not be the most good looking or charming 16 yr old, she  definitely knows how to sell shoes!  When the owner of the shoe store she  works for hires her to be her personal driver... Jenna is in for the  journey of her lifetime. She learns a lot about herself, as well as others.  In the end, she is a true hero. <br />I think any teenager would enjoy this  book! Definitely pick it up... you won't be sorry!	2000-07-12

She overcomes  many challenges to endure the days. Her love for baseball player Tom Gordon  (#36) keeps her going. She conserves her walkman's batteries to be able to  listen to the broadcast of their game every night.<br />The ending wasn't too  good, but the book in itself is good enough so the ending doesn't ruin the  book.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone. Its very fast reading (I read  it in one night) and although its a little over 200 pages... it seems like  a lot less.	2000-06-23

Although some issues may be a little too &quot;perfect&quot; the characters all resemble characteristics we possess! Whether its Jenna's undying love for Miguel, or  Nicoles obsession w/weight... we can all relate on some level. I really  recommend all teenagers to try this series out. The books are extremely  entertaining and definitely light-reading.	2000-06-07

It was extremely repeptitive... telling us again and again how the mother left. This got kind of irritation considering you were reading the same thing over and  over again with different wording. It was alright in some parts though... I  do have to say. But it was definitely not a wonderful book. Okay, I guess.  If I were to have rated this book without reading the ending it may have  been a higher rating but the ending made it absolutely idiotic. It made not  sense whatesover. If you are really into poetry and stuff you may like it a  little more than I did... but not to much more. It uses a lot of subliminal  meanings and metaphors and stuff. So, whatever. Read if you want, but most  likely your wasting your time.	1999-07-28

If your as big a fan as I am though... you've probably heard this stuff before.... but it doesn't hurt to hear again. I think some of the things written may not be completely  accurate when comparing them to the official book (which was written by 'N  Sync) but it seems pretty close. It is a really fast read and I suggest  buying it if you love JC!!	1999-07-28

I found it really hard to follow. I didn't understand what was happening at all during the 70 pages I read. Maybe it got better  at the end... I don't know. I honesty could not continue reading it though.  This is one of the first books that I haven't been able to finish. I feel  bad that I'm giving it a bad rating but it's what I honestly feel about the  book. Sorry.	1999-07-28

It had all the cheesy lines and plots but, was entertaining. It is a quick read and was pretty enjoyable. The ending was quite abrubt though, and I think the  author could have built it up a little more. Oh well! Read it if you want a  slightly scary story!	1999-07-28

It is very emotional and gets you to feel for the characters. Wally Lamb is a wonderful author and I love his writing style. I hope he will continue to write more books.  He is certainly my favorite author. The book is definitely long but trust  me... it is worth your time. No matter how long it takes you... READ IT!

As the rest of the books in this series, Ben's in Love was good but... after reading #3 in the series (which was excellent by the way) I had expected something better.
