I have many Yoga books and videos and I think this book is by far the best book to start with if you want to learn Yoga. The instructions and the pictures are clear and easy to follow and the book is so well  organized.<br />You do Yoga every day for 28 days and you slowly learn more  and more postures and you constantly review the one you learned so far, you  just follow the plan for the day you are on and you don´t have to flip the  pages back and fourth.<br />There are lots of books that deal with Yoga in  more depth but they are often not so good for the beginner or not as  clearly organiced as this one.<br />The book ends with all the exercices  organiced into three day practise routines which I have been using for many  years with Good results, Highly Recomended.<br />Also recomended Yoga  Journal´s Yoga for beginners.	2000-06-13

This book is from 1968 but it´s still a very good book to start your Odd Time studies with. You have to know how to read music to use it (if dont know how to do that you could check out the books by Robert  Starer).<br />Although written by a very famous drummer this is not a drumset  book, but an exercise book written to develop your sight reading skill and  understanding of Odd Rhythms, and it is suitable for everyone no matter  what instrument you play, the examples are not melodic, just written on one  note, so the focus is on the Rhythm, and the examples are from simple to  quite complicated.<br />The book deals with Rhythms in 3,5,6,7,8,9 and 12,  with either the quarter or eighth or sixteenth note as the basic pulse.  There are sections dealing with changing metres also. The book is about 130  pages so there is a lot of stuff here, the exercices start simple and then  gradualy get more complicated.<br />A fine book, Highly Recommended.<br />Other  good rhythm book Authors are Alan Dworsky, Gary Hess, Peter Magadini,  Reinhard Flatichler, Gary Chaffee and Gavin Harrison.	2000-06-11

This is of  course also central in the Spiritual Traditions of Taoism , Zen and  Yoga.<br />Krishnamurti rarely says anything definite about God, but instead  tries to help the seeker to prepare himself to get some insight into the  Sacred.<br />This book is exellent like all his books are, but if you have not  read any of his books I would Recommend to start with Freedom From the  Known.	2000-06-11

This book is an excelent reply from Mary Lutyens to the book, lives in the shadow with J.Krishnamurti, by Radha Rajagopal Sloss.<br />Mary answers the accusations made against Krishnamurti with a clear and precise arguments,  something that probably was not very difficult to do because Sloss book is  realy quite Silly. If you put on glasses made of Jealousy, Ignorance and  thirst for Revenge then of course that is how you will see the world and  that´s obviously the glasses that Sloss wears most of the time, in her book  you get the impression that Krishnamurti and his Friends are all liars and  the Rajagopals are Always telling the truth, how simple her world must  be.<br />One must ask oneself this question, if Sloss is telling the Truth,  Then all those other people who have written about Krishnamurti are Liars,  and we´re talking about a lot of people here, all who have similar and  Positive things to say about Krishnamurti, And there is only one person who  has something to defend, and that is of course Radha Rajagopal Sloss, so go  figure!<br />So if you want to look into the world of the Spiritual and  Famous, And the Jealous and Ignorant read these books, But what is much  more interesting is to read some of Krishnamurti´s books like his Notebook  or The Awakening og Intelligence, Or what is probably the most important  thing have a look at yourself and Be you own Light.	2000-06-10

One gets the impression from reading this  Wonderfull book that Sunanda was a warm hearted, sincere and intelligent seeker of spiritual truth.<br />Since her first meeting with Krishnamurti in 1947 to her death in  1999 she did a lot of work for Krishnamurti and the Krishnamurti foundation  in India. This book is a collection af meditation on the Spiritual Search  and the influence of Krishnamurti and his Teaching on her.  She says that  she often got a sense of the Sacred around Krishnamurti and in situations  like that it´s so easy fo fall into the Guru trap and to stop thinking for  oneself and just relying on the words and influence of others, But as  Krishnamurti said to her  &quot; I can tell you that there is a lovely  garden beyond the hill. I can hold your hand, But You have to walk and  climb the hill.&quot;(p-11). <br />This book is inspiring  and gives one a lot  to think on, and her writing is Poetic and Clear.<br />Also recomended are the  Krishnamurti Biograpy´s by Pupul Jayakar and Mary Lutyens and some of  Krishnamurti´s books like his Notebook and Freedom from the Known.	2000-06-10

This book is from 1970, so of course it is a bit dated but this is a book about the fundamentals of foil fencing and that has hardly changed for a very long time, we still use the same basic parry´s and riopste´s that were  developed around 1600 or so. The best thing about this book are the stop  action photos which you can see by flipping the pages back and forth and  that is unique (I think) in a fencing book, that kind of thing may seem  useless in these day´s of video but unfortunately good videos about fencing  are still hard to come by. The book is organized into 5 chapters which deal  with the basic priciples and structure of fencing, stance and attack, all  the basic movement and the art of deception.<br />Of course there are a lot of  more modern and up to date books about foil fencing available today but  this was the first book about fencing I got so perhaps I´m a bit  sentimental about it but like I said the stop action photos make this book  unique and fun.	1999-09-30

The System is a wordless story about a live in a big,ugly, sleazy city. In The System Kuper creates a complicated story of many lives and how they interact whith each other, all told in pictures with hardly any words, and the pictures are fabulous, Kuper has a very individual style which I think is brilliant. This is not a comic book for kids it touches on themes of racism, violence,love, sex, organiced crime,corupt cop´s, injustice and of course the endless search for freedom from all this.<br />Many people seem to think that comics are just for kids and not a serious art form which can say anything to adults, this is just one of many comic books available today that totaly demolishes that bogus wiew, if you have not read a comic since you were a kid, give this a try I dont think you will be disapointed.	1999-09-29

This is one of the best books to start with if  you want to study rhythm but I also highly recomend it to all musicians (I  had been playing the piano for many years when I read it and it tought me a  lot).<br />You should also check out Flatischlers great drum band  &quot;Megadrum&quot;, it includes one of the greatest percussionist on this  planet, excellent stuff.<br />Three other recomended rhythm books &quot;The  healing drum&quot; &quot;The drummers path&quot; and &quot;A Rhythmic  vocabulary&quot;.	1999-09-20

I think rhythm study is highly neglected in modern western music education, I studied piano for many years and of course you have to learn how to read rhythmic notation to be able to read music but there  was no  study of rhythm itself in all my studies. I felt a need to learn more about  rhythm and I started to play the djembe and  I certainly do not regret it,  for apart from learning to play the djembe I have become a better pianist.  This book is  great to begin rhythm studies, I wish I had had this book  many years ago, I highly recomend it for all musicians regardless of  instrument because there is more to music than just melody and harmony, you  have to have a good understanding of rhythm also.<br />But I want more,there  are available tons of thick books about harmony but hardly anything about  rhythm so I hope the author writes another book.<br />(I read somewhere that  the late French composer Messiaen had compleated a big book about rhythm  just before he died, I hope this is true and that it will be published  soon).	1999-09-20

I had been playing the piano for many years and wanted to learn more about rhythms and I picked up this book in a local bookstore and within a year I had started to learn to play African rhythms on the Djembe and Djun Djun.  This book really opened my eyes to the beauty and complexity of traditional  African rhythms and how they influenced the rhythms of both North and Latin  America.<br />The book does not teach any rhythms but teaches all the basic  principles af playing the drum and the mental/spiritual aspect of  it.<br />Highly inspirational and Higly recomended.<br />Two other good books   about the philosophical aspect of drumming are Diallo´s &quot;The Healing  Drum&quot; and Reinhard Flatischler´s &quot;The Forgotten Power Of  Rhythm;Taketina&quot;.<br />And a good book who teaches a lot of rhythms is  &quot;A Rhythmic vocabulary&quot; by Alan Dworsky&quot;	1999-09-20

It was wery interesting for me, a guy from Iceland to read this book, for Dialo´s life in Africa was so totaly different from growing up here in Iceland, but what we do have in common though is a deep love and respect  for drumming, music and the power of both to heal. I would like to add,  that though there is a big difference on the surface it is interesting to  see how similar humans are underneath the surface.<br />I recomend this book  for all who have interest in traditional African music and culture, and for  all those who play the Djembe this book is a must.<br />For those of you who  are studying drumming and/or rhythm I also recomend Sule Greg Vilson´s  &quot;The drummers path&quot;, Reinhard Flatichler´s &quot;The forgotten  power of rhythm&quot;, And &quot;A rhytmmic vocbulary&quot; by Alan  Dworsky.	1999-09-20

Herges Tintin comics are classics and probably the best of the genre. They really are for all ages,some of my best childhood memories are of reading Tintin or Tinni as he is known in Iceland and I still enjoy reading these  books today. What makes the Tintin books so good is they seem to have  everything in it that make up a good comicbook,originality, interesting  characters,adventure,suspense,great humor and well thought out storys.  If  I had to chose only one Tintin book to take to a desert island I think the  seven crystal balls would be it. The book is masterfully drawn like of  course all the Tintin books and the story is not just an adventures  thriller but it has a mysterious atmosphere to it which i really like.	1998-12-15
