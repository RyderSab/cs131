No one in the past has dug deeper into the Asian woman psyche than she has in her book.        Asian women are far from being simple or submissive, as the tale goes. They are not only subtle and gentle, but also complex, goal oriented, calculating and can be domineering. They have been known to topple kings, emperors, and governments in the past without even holding officially a position of power. They therefore are not weak, but simply display self-controlled inner strength. In Vietnam, they are known as the Noi Tuong (Minister of the Interior: they run and control the household) compared to the Ngoai Tuong (man: Foreign Minister dealing with outside business). Their real power lies in their pulling the strings behind the scenes, in an unsuspected, unacknowledged, and at times Machavellian manner.         The author's book, which attempts to unravel the Asian woman psyche, is an important tribute to the often misjudged and underestimated Asian women. It is a work of art and labor as well as a literary achievement. In time I'm sure it will turn out to be a bestseller.	2005-04-26

This is probably one of the best, if not the best book I have read about that huge topic of LOVE. Among all the books dealing with this topic, this one stands out because of the depth of its explanation and the poetry of its wording. <br />  <br />  Welwood suggests that love is not simply a pure physical attraction. It could lift lovers to another level: the discovery of oneself. Love, according to the author is a journey, a path toward understanding oneself and one's partner. From there, if could lift lovers to a state of communion: they become warriors who travel on the same road toward spiritual enrichment. Viewed from this angle, love seems to be divine. It has the power of transforming people like any other thing in the world.  <br /> <br />  This is part of the eastern philosophy that has suggested back in the 6th century AC that: <br />    \\"Love enjoyed by the ignorant <br />     Becomes bondage. <br />     That very same love <br />     Tested by one with understanding <br />     Brings liberation.\\"  <br /> <br />  Using a combination of poetry, eastern philosophy (one ground two paths, alliance of warriors, suchness...) and western psychology, Welwood has been able to weave a tale inner fight and self-discovery that could lead lovers to enlightenment. Enlightenment, not in its religious sense, is defined as a constant state of happiness without suffering. And that is what we are searching for in our human condition. <br /> <br />  This book should be read by anyone falling in love for the first or the hundredth time.    <br />	2005-01-25

The author advises us that by accepting the impermanence of life, we can also realize its beauty and the need for us seek enlightenment and to care for other beings in order to gain happiness now and in the afterlife. <br /> <br />The writing is very personal, deep and meaningful.

She then discusses the work of the colonizers and the role of native and French women in the colonies. The work ends with the battle of Dien Bien Phu, the exodus of the boat people, and the revisiting of Indochina.<br />She did not go into details about the exploitation of the country resources or of the natives, except to mention about French brutal colonial past. One error is to think that the Vietnamese presently living in France were submissive and apolitical.

The editor has brought together five people who were directly or indirectly involved in the war including McNamara. <br />The authors discussed how the war changed the way America saw itself and the world. The war also nudged the military system to dramatically change its ways in order to better adapt to different modalities of warfare.

Inability to adapt to the complexities of running a country during peacetime caused severe economic problems as well as charges of corruption. Harsh criticisms and even rebellions from the people, members of the party, and Buddhists occured as a result but were violently suppressed.

Chasing the American Dream could be dangerous to your health. People with extrinsic goal orientation (i.e. chasing fame, fortune, recognition, and good looks) were more likely to be depressed than the rest of the population.<br />The richest citizens on earth (Americans) had a higher infant mortality and lower life expectancy than 25 other economically developed nations. A high infant mortality and low life expectancy correlate with an inequality in income distribution. <br />Americans also took less vacation time and worked five to ten weeks more per year than people of other countries. This correlates with a high incidence of depression and other medical conditions including obesity and diabetes.<br />The authors concluded that economic inequality, relentless competition, escalating consumption threatened the health of the people and the nation.	2004-03-01

The author argues that the government could raise its defense spending up to 5-7% with much grumbling from the population. However, the U.S. saddled with a high debt rate, a slow recovery, and 40 millions of uninsured would face tough choices: as Greenspan has recently suggested, if tax cuts are to be made permanent, social security entitlements would have to be cut down. In the end, something has to give: world domination or economy.<br />Although war can be brilliantly executed as in Iraq, pacification would be an expensive and lengthy undertaking. Without pacification, a war success could only be transient and meaningless. The U.S. are usually unwilling to fight a long war due to a drain of its human and economic resources and potential resistance from its people if the war lasts longer than expected.<BR>    <BR>The power of pure force will not last forever: just look at the examples of Babylon, Rome, Greece, Egypt, England, France, China, the Incas and other countries that had once ruled over the world.	2004-02-27

An American cyclist during his bike journey from Saigon to Hanoi in 1993 fell in love with a girl in the ancient imperial city of Hue. He was given a year to win her heart, which in the end was not that difficult. Although the environment was idyllic with its temples, its river, its old colonial houses, and its bare simplicity, he soon realized the gulf between the two worlds (America and Vietnam) was large. Bridging this gulf was difficult, although not insurmountable.<br />The hurdles caused by the communist bureaucracy on the other hand proved to be overwhelming. One has to live in Vietnam to understand how archaic and corrupt the regime turned out to be: the police one day bluntly told him his visa had expired while it was still good for two more months, and so on. The hurdles kept coming and anyone other than Sullivan would have quit a long time ago.<br />This is a love story from a third world country: it is beautiful for its simplicity, its purity, and the difficulties the lovers had to overcome to achieve their goal.	2004-01-24

This is the first attempt to quantify the accomplishment of individuals and countries worldwide in the fields of arts and sciences by calculating the amount of space allocated to them in reference works. This is quite an achievement, as the writing no doubt requires a lot of reading, analyses, and work.<br />Although the book is very instructive, I have problems with the methodology used. It is very difficult to compare Shakespeare to another writer like Homer, or Voltaire and Rousseau, as they were from different times and wrote about different topics, some in verses others in prose. It is even more difficult to compare the achievements of Newton to those of Galileo, Faraday, Laplace or Euclid. It would be difficult to make the assertion that Pasteur or Fleming are more or less influential than inventors in other fields.<br />It is also difficult to compare Chinese achievements to those of the Europeans for two simple reasons: 1) western inventions are well publicized in the English literature while eastern works are rarely translated into English, 2) westerners are more dynamic and outgoing than their Chinese counterparts who in the last two millenia are more interested in moral issues than sciences. It should be noted that for many centuries, the Chinese have made tremendous advances in sciences and arts (gunpowder, ink, wheel, and so on) only to suddenly decide to achieve moral perfection rather than pursuing scientific achievements. The world would have been different had they not changed their minds.<br />I have learned a lot from the author: his work gives me a visual and global assessment, although somewhat biased, of the achievements of the giants in history. It is also one of the most original and probably controversial books I have ever read. It will certainly cause a lot of ink to flow; therefore, it will have its own place in history.	2003-10-30

This book presents beautiful pictures of famous and enticing modern women: but to call them \\"femmes fatales\\" would be to mischaracterize them.<br />By definition, the term \\"femmes fatales\\" was coined to gorgeous women whose actions were detrimental or harmful to their men or partners. Thus, in real life a woman could be gorgeous without being fatal, or vice versa, she could be fatal without being exceptionally gorgeous. Cleopatra was one such woman, who although not extraordinarily beautiful, was able to charm two Roman generals and to lead them to their downfall.  <br />Although hairstyle was an important component of a woman's appearance, it was certainly not the unique feature of a person. Her eyes, smile, demeanor, sleek appearance, and clothing also played important roles. Therefore, to reduce a woman's character to her hairdo, as the hairstylist-author had suggested, was to overly simplify the matter.<br />The women photographed in the book were certainly &quot;chic,&quot; although not necessarily &quot;fatal.&quot;	2003-10-28

It is generally thought that Confucianism tends to subjugate women by promoting a patriarchal system and erasing them from official discourses and records. Revisionist Ko and collaborators attempt to show that women were \\"neither victims nor rebels within these Confucian societies (China, Japan, Korea) for they embraced aspects of official norms while resisting others.\\" In other words, women were willing participants in the Confucian orthodoxy.<br />While agreeing with some of these thoughts, it comes to my mind that there is no mention in their book about Vietnam, which was a full-fledged Confucian society as of the first century B.C. Whether this omission is related to a lack of or difficulty in locating experts in the field of Vietnamese Confucian society is not known.<br />A cursory look at premodern Vietnam reveals that this brand of Confucianism had not only deprived women of their basic rights, but also promoted a strict Confucian patriarchal system that was not conducive to the recognition of their talents or dignity. The two best Vietnamese literary works \\"Luc Van Tien and Kim Van Kieu\\" were written by men who extolled the virtues of women faithful to Confucian norms. The patriarchal atmosphere was so overbearing that women had to embrace the norms in order to survive. Anyone who refused to comply with the rules could be dismissed as heretic or unfaithful and cast out of the society. Confucian Vietnamese women, therefore, cannot be described as willful participants of the Confucian system.<br />Ko and al. throughout their book have not convincingly dispelled the notion that Confucian women, except for Japanese women, were not victims in their societies. On the contrary, their discourses have only showed that women were relegated and confined to an \\"inner-domestic sphere\\" in all these Confucian societies. The fact that women accepted their assigned roles does not mean they liked it. Being subdued by males, they did the best they could: they collaborated withmen so that they could survive within the male dominated society.<br />While disagreeing with the authors' conclusions, I believe their work is an important contribution to the study of Confucian women.	2003-10-03

Others came to conquer: there were the French, the Japanese, the Americans, and the communists. They came and left behind destruction, misery, but also change. One of the writers did not fail to notice that everyone had written about Saigon, including writers from north and central Vietnam, except the southerners themselves.<br />The Saigonese had endured the 20-year-long war and the harsh communist occupation. They not only survived all these tragedies, but also had prospered. The city remained attractive and vibrant despite its vices and slums and its citizens are as industrious and resolute as ever.<br />Despite all odds, Saigon remained the economic engine of the new Vietnam.

Her father was an ARVN grunt who went on to become a handyman, then a gardener in the US. His past, however, troubled him. He kept on starring at the sea across the ocean trying to make a sense of his tumultuous life in Vietnam: his years fighting the enemy during the war and then his incarceration in communist reeducation camps, his escape by boat, the memory of his drowned son, and the lack of news from his extended family stranded in a communist land. <br />This is a moving story of one family of boat people trying to survive in a foreign land while battling with the horrors and demons of the past.	2003-07-13

What brought Ed Gargan to explore the Mekong river was not only his interest in Southeast Asia, but also the desire to exorcise his war demons. During the Vietnam War, he was one the many conscientious objectors who protested against the war and ended up in jail.<br />Gargan spent a whole year traveling the Mekong from its source in the Tibetan mountains to its mouth in Vietnam. What resulted from this year of solitude and disconnection from western civilization was a beautifully written and detailed analysis of the people who lived along this mighty river. <br />He visited Tibet, a country invaded by the Chinese, then southwest China, Burma, Laos, the golden triangle where opium was mass produced, and finally Cambodia, and Vietnam.<br />In Vietnam he journeyed through the delta towns of Can Tho, Chau Doc, My Tho, and Ben Tre where he described the activity of the floating markets and took the pulse of the local people. He visited with a bui doi, product of an American soldier and a Vietnamese woman then talked to a former South Vietnamese translator for the US Army who spent three years in a reeducation camp after the fall of Saigon. The father of a businesswoman he met in Can Tho was also interned and died in a communist reeducation camp. <br />He noticed that, while southerners were straightforward, northerners were at best vague, if not duplicitous. Southerners, with their sense of identity and culture, deplored what they called the invasion and occupation of their land by northerners who \\"brought a rigid authoritarianism that has stunted the lives of Vietnamese.\\" <br />This is a tale of war, suffering, and destruction. This is also a moving account of postwar East Asia and Indochina where people attempted to rebuild their lives and struggled for survival under communist control while still yearning for the world beyond (read freedom and education).	2003-07-11

This is a truly impressive work from the part of the author who has apparently interviewed more than 350 people from all sides, although only half of the stories have appeared in the book. I have the few following comments:<br />First, I hope he would make the rest of the stories available to all of us. Second, the Vietnam war remembered from all sides seems to be a misnomer since the proportion of interviewees was slanted in favor of the Americans (71%) and North Vietnamese (22%). South Vietnamese and others shared the remaining 7%. This uneven distribution no doubt would distort the views about the war, unless one would characterize it as an American-North Vietnamese war.   <br />Third, the author has warned us the book is about recollections of the war and as such, everyones memory is partial, selective and faulty. He has also indicated that since Vietnam remains a one-party state that does not allow full freedom of speech, we should expect North Vietnamese interviewees to tow party line rather than expressing their true beliefs. I am, therefore, not totally surprised when a North Vietnamese talked about the corrupt South Vietnamese regime (1954-1975), but failed to mention anything about the badly corrupt present communist regime.   <br />Fourth, the chapter about the South Vietnamese commando who was dropped into North Vietnam in the 60s and ended up becoming a captive for the next 22 years turned out to be was one of the most interesting stories of the book. He is a true patriot. However, there was no mention about the two million South Vietnamese who left their country following the fall of Saigon and the millions who were interned in reeducation camps throughout South Vietnam.<br />Fifth, the fact that the ARVN suffered 224,000 deaths and more than one million wounded contradicted the assumption that the U.S. did all the fighting (58,000 deaths) while the South Vietnamese did everything to avoid it. Hanoi had to bear the consequencesof sending 1.1 million youths to their deaths. In addition, 2 million civilians (one each from North and South) died during the war. The total casualty was estimated at 3.34 million people (9%) of a combined population of 37 millions (1975). General Giap was appropriate to call it the most atrocious conflict in human history, although he should remember he was one of the instigators of the war.   <br />Despite all these drawbacks, this is by far one of the best books I have ever read about the war. It deals with almost everyone involved in the conflict from grunts to generals, war resisters, civilians, Vietnamese and Americans, and those who, within the U.S. government, argued for and against the war.    <br />I hope the reading of this excellent book would open our eyes to the different points of view that circulated around the world and make us wiser.	2003-06-24

I have read many books written in English about Vietnam, but found only a few that clearly reflect the soul and spirit of the Vietnamese: \\"The tapestries\\" is one of them.<br />The story took place between 1916 and 1932 in a small village near Hue, the Imperial City of Vietnam. This is a book about commoners, middle class people and royalty. It deals with a wicked magistrate and his granddaughter Mai but also a heroine Ven, who at age 15 was given in marriage to then seven year-old Dan. There are also a minister, a eunuch, the queen's lady-in-waiting, and a time-teller (similar to Quasimodo in the Hunchback of Notre Dame).                         <br />The story then moved to Hue and we are given a glimpse of the slowly fading monarchy. There were plots, murders, injustice, hate, love, and redemption throughout of the book. The plots were as thick as the tropical jungle (like any Vietnamese story) with a twist at every corner. The author kept us guessing (wrong most of the time) and held us in suspense until the next chapter.<br />I found the novel remarkable and I am certain the reader will appreciate and thank the author for bringing something exotic to the American public.	2003-01-09

This novel written between 1953 and 1955 has been made into a new film, which has been recently released by Miramax. This is the story about the early stages of the American involvement in Vietnam. Although simplistic, it captures the essence of the political turmoil of Vietnam in the fifties: the French trying to hang on to their colony, the Americans trying their hands in a new country, the \\"third force\\", the communists, the peasants, and so on.<br />It deals with an American idealist, Pyle, who without knowing its true colors tried to help the \\"third force\\" fight the communists in Vietnam. Fowler, a seasoned English reporter questioned Pyle's real motives. He suspected, like the British had done in Burma years earlier, the Americans would soon get tired of the involvement, leave the natives fight for themselves, and let them be slaughtered by their enemies. This was a fascinating prediction, which came to be true 30 years later. How Graham Greene could predict that event back then still puzzles me? The plot, however, thickened as Pyle tried to lure away Fowler's Vietnamese mistress.<br />I have to concede the novelist had more insight than many of our politicians. Since the novel raises important issues, it should be a \\"must read\\" book for many Americans.	2003-01-06

In this book, Dr. McKelvey wrote a detailed and intimate account of the South Vietnamese military officers' fates after the end of the Vietnam War. <br />The message is troublesome but not surprising: the military personnel were rounded into re-education camps and suffered untold tragedies from humiliation, torture, mental degradation to physical impoverishment within a communist prison system. The majority of the officers were jailed from ten to fifteen years; one officer was detained for a total of 22 years.<br />While 70,000 former political inmates and their families were allowed to immigrate to the U.S. through the ODP (Orderly Departure Program), many more are still living on the fringes of the Vietnamese communist society. A former major drives a pedicab for a living. In this McKelvey's book, we heard the voices of a doctor, a tailor, a politician, an engineer, a spy, a pilot, and a teacher. They all endured \\"grueling and unforgiving ordeals that only the strongest would have survived.\\" Family members were ostracized for being related to the political prisoners; their wives suffered uncounted financial, emotional, physical hardships, their children barred from a decent education. <br />The book is one of the few that deal with the long-term psychological effects of the incarceration on the inmates and the sufferings of their relatives.<br />The author concludes that: 1) War does not end when peace treaties are signed because the negative rippling effects of war and destruction affect many generations to come. 2) The U.S. should be very careful about intervening militarily in any part of the World. 3) The U.S., if it does go to war, cannot simply abandon friends and allies to the mercies of common enemies.	2003-01-06

This is a detailed account of the U.S. consul's last months in Can Tho, South Vietnam and his risky escape by boat on the Mekong River in April 1975. As the collapse of Saigon was nearing and as the airlift of Americans and third country nationals from Can Tho never materialized, McNamara himself took charge of guiding more than 300 people to safety on military barges along the Mekong River. He was recognized for his bravery and given a medal in 1977. <br />The book was also a tribute to General Nguyen Khoa Nam, the IV Corps South Vietnamese commander who refused to be evacuated and remained at his post until the last minute. McNamara had known him for over a year as a brave and dedicated officer and a man of honor. General Nam and his deputy General Hung killed themselves instead of surrendering to the enemy a few days later.<br />This is an interesting perspective of an American's last weeks in South Vietnam, his dealings with the Americans, the Vietnamese, and the CIA.	2002-12-31

Three long years (1976-1979) in the communist reeducation camps of Da Ban and A-30 have opened the eyes of this former South Vietnamese Liaison Officer to U.S. Forces in Vietnam. Had he told the communists about his former association with the U.S. Forces, he would have been suspected of being a CIA agent, therefore, kept in jail much longer.<br />He wrote about the 10 hour-a-day and 7-day-week-work under adverse conditions (rain, typhoon), the 200 grams of rice daily ration, the constant beating he and the other inmates had suffered, and the tribulations they endured after their release. Details about life in communist Vietnam are supported by graphic illustrations. <br />This is a difficult topic to write about and Lu Thanh has done a great job in conveying to the reader his feelings about this forced incarceration, the mistreatment he has endured, and his difficult escape by boat out of Vietnam during which he almost lost his life.	2002-12-31

It is packed with so many social and historical facts I have to digest each data before moving to another chapter (the reader, however, could skip these sections if he/she did not want to delve into these details).<br />Besides the usual digressions about Tet (Vietnamese New Year) and the Tet offensive, the Trung sisters (see book under the same name), the Mongol invasion, the story of the betel nut, and so on, the book could be broadly subdivided into two sections dealing with daughter and mother's recollections about the war. This is one of the rare books that approach the Vietnam War from the natives' point of view. <br />The year was 1975, when both daughter and mother landed in America shortly before the fall of Saigon. We were given a glimpse about their new life in a foreign land, their adjustment to new customs, ways of thinking, and schooling system. We learned about the story of a U.S. colonel who almost had been killed in Vietnam a few years earlier and who now sponsored the two refugees to the U.S. <br />The most interesting section, however, was the one related by the mother: she opened our eyes to colonial Vietnam, the system of provincial landlords and peasants, and the Viet Cong. Behind the façade of a plain housewife, the mother slowly unveiled the dark family secrets she had been trying to hide from her daughter all her life. This is a story with a twist that made the reading exciting and worthwhile. How the author has been able to weave together the stories of a U.S. colonel, the Viet Cong, the landlords and peasants, and the refugees together in a short book is simply remarkable.<br />This is the Vietnam War many Americans did not know about until now.	2002-12-27

I bought this book with high expectation after having seen it mentioned on the PBS station. What I have found is disconcerting.<br />The author mentions the northern farmers built \\"substantial homes of cement and brick designed to last a life time.\\" Is it really true? I have been told they are still poor with a yearly income of less than $US300 and can barely make ends meet. I wonder how they could build substantial homes under these circumstances. <br />He is only aware of 40 reeducation camps set up to intern 400,000 southerners after the war: this makes 10,000 inmates per camp. The literature reports more than 1,000 camps holding an excess of one million inmates at one time. One Hanoi official even puts the number at two and a half millions.<br />If the southerners have \\"no longer to fear their government as long as they aren't interested in making any political statement\\", 1) they must have lived in fear of the Hanoi regime since 1975 and 2) they still do not enjoy political freedom and the freedom of speech. The statement also implies elections in today communist Vietnam are not free.<br />He also mentions about the South Vietnamese burning Pleiku to the ground in March 1975. This is a far cry from the truth. How could they have time to burn the town down when they were trying to escape from the communists who were pursuing them? To alert them they were getting out of town?<br />The author thinks propaganda does not have a \\"negative connotation\\" in Vietnam because \\"people are too ignorant to decide for themselves the merits of an issue.\\" I take this as an insult to the Vietnamese in general. The people certainly are not ignorant, but simply fearful of the Hanoi regime: as mentioned above, they are not free to make any political statement without being harassed by the regime.<br />And the list of \\"misstatements\\" goes on and on. It is fair to assume the author either repeats verbatim what the communists had told him or he has been thoroughly brainwashed by them during his five-year stay in Hanoi. Anyway, this is not good reporting and I, therefore, cannot recommend this book.	2002-07-23

Dommen elucidates the perspectives of all the parties involved in the conflict, namely North and South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. He thinks the fates of the Indochinese countries are intertwined and the loss of the nationalists to the communists in Laos and Cambodia has adversely affected the war in Vietnam.<br />Dommen begins his story in 1626, but the fratricidal war actually started in 1600 when duke Nguyen Hoang broke away from the then Thanh Long (Hanoi) regime, settled in present-day central Vietnam. and thus founded South Vietnam. North and South fought against each other for 50 years from 1627 to 1677 followed by one hundred-year peace. It was only in 1778 when the southern general Nguyen Hue reunited the whole country. He unfortunately died young at the age of 40 and another southerner Nguyen Anh reunited the country for the second time in 1802.<br />Dommen also looks at the war as a struggle between communists and non communist-nationalists that eventually went the communist way. The assassination of President Diem, the US take over of the Vietnam War, Kissinger's machiavellian ploys to extricate the Americans out of Vietnam, and the eventual fate of the nationalists are carefully analyzed. He hopes the latter could recover one day the sovereignty that has been stolen from them by Hanoi, a regime of \\"mendicity and mendacity.\\"<br />The author is to be congratulated for his in-depth review of this long and agonizing war, for which many lives have been lost, certainly not in vain. The lessons are still vivid and it is hoped we can learn enough from them to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.	2002-07-23

This is a very readable, detailed, and lengthy account about the author's 1,632 days in various reeducation camps in South Vietnam after the collapse of Saigon. He was not judged nor convicted of any crime: he was just thrown into a camp for having been a military officer from the defeated army.<br />This is not the typical treatment for a convicted felon or criminal, but the deliberate incarceration and harsh punishment of a prisoner of war. Some stories are laughable, while other are bitter and painful. The treatment of the prisoners is repugnant and marked by constant beatings, forced starvation, excessive hard labor, indoctrination, and inhumane treatment. Inmates are dehumanized and victimized by the wardens who are simply sadistic and just look for reasons to inflict punishment. Many of the inmates simply died of starvation, lack of medical care, and from infection.  Others could not stand any longer and took their own lives. One could understand why, once released from the camps, they all looked for ways to get out of the country.<br />The sheer number of information the author has been able to recollect and relay to us would be useful to those who are interested in learning about the communist system.	2002-05-21

This is, by far, the most authoritative work in English about the history of Vietnam from prehistory to 974 AD.<br />The Vietnamese (Lac people as they were called at the time) were part of the Dong Son civilization, which was characterized by its bronze drums depicting aquatic scenery. Over the years, they brought to the Asian culture the \\"pho\\", the \\"ao dai\\", various musical instruments, poetry, and so on.<br />But what defined the Vietnamese is their indomitable aspiration for freedom. They just wanted to be left alone, therefore, were not always seen as \\"actors\\", but \\"reactors\\"  to events around them. Despite being dominated for along time by the Chinese and the French, they yearned to live in a free country.<br />Sandwiched between giant China in the north and the kingdoms of Champa and Khmer in the south, they knew a long time ago they were not Chinese and, therefore, refused to remain enslaved by them. The Trung sisters (see book of same name) revolted against the Chinese and reigned as the first and only Queens of Vietnam until 42 AD. Defeated by Ma Yuan, they fell back under Chinese influence until 939 AD until Ngo Quyen was brilliant enough to recover the country's independence.<br />The period covered by Taylor represented the difficult times the Lac people went through to mature into an organized society strong enough to free themselves from the Chinese. Besides the Trung Queens, many others had tried unsuccessfully over the years to free from the Chinese yoke. The birth of Vietnam was thus not a smooth and normal one: it was the result of a series of abortive rebellions until its final success in 939 AD.	2002-05-21

In a mere 165 pages, Professor pipes was able to convey the essence of communism: the quest for an elusive social equality that had gone haywire.<br />It all started with a bad idea that went worse each time the communists tried to tinker with it. In order to promote equality, they, on one hand, suppressed private property, free press and free elections; but on the other hand, they established a new class: the &quot;Party members&quot; to carry out the execution of the program. The latter received special treatments in form of nomenklaturas: they were able to buy high quality items in special shops while common people had to line up to buy scarce, low quality merchandise in government stores. This, among other things, ran counter to the equality program.<br />They then coerced people into working more but receiving less in form of wages and benefits: this was another contradiction of the system. In the end, the privileged few were powerful and had total control over the silent majority. The Soviet Union then diverted 30 to 40% of its GNP to build up a strong military system at the expense of draining the nation's limited economic resources. Bureaucracy led to economic insufficiency, decreased production and further impoverishment of the people; it also led to man-made starvation.<br />The system finally imploded resulting in the breakdown of the Soviet Union. The cost of the experimentation was staggering: 85 to 100 million people died as a result.	2002-05-21

There was also a king, but he was powerless.<br />North and South were warring against each other like during the 1954-75 war and the people were poor. The brothers revolted against the southern warlord and displaced him all the way to the southernmost tip of Vietnam. Nguyen Hue then moved against the northern warlord and chased him into China.<br />The Chinese invaded Vietnam at the request of the northern warlord. Nguyen Hue beat them handily and enthroned himself as king Quang Trung. The brilliant strategist not only was able to defeat the warlords but also the Chinese and to reunify the country in 1788. He unfortunately died in 1792 at the age of 42. His empire rapidly unraveled after his death.

Even after release from the camps, they were watched closed, lost their human rights and were returned to jails at the slightest infraction. Unable to live under this suffucating environment, they escaped abroad.<br />An ex-colonel detailed his incarceration in a northern camp where 12 inmates out of 500 died of dysentery (a curable form of intractable diarrhea) and others hunted for and ate mice and crickets \\"raw\\" in order to survive.

The author proposes to study more than 1500 good companies and select criteria which would make a good company GREAT. Companies and their CEOs, in general, are more than ever focused on making money without making decent products or providing good service. They might be viable in the short time, but never became great in long range. The great companies, however, prospered because they did both.<br />The book illustrates a few basic points worth remmbering:<br />#1. The CEO should work for the company, and not the other way around.<BR>#2. He should look for the right people, instead of filling his Board with friends or cronies in order to have total control of the company.<BR>#3. The company should have discipline: disciplined people, thought and action.<BR>#4. The company should have basic core values.<br />If all the companies just follow a few of these rules, they not only would be immensely successful, but also won't have to fudge their books.	2002-05-21

Using primary and secondary sources, the author has been able to document the organization set up by the communists in South Vietnam from 1975 to 1982 to coerce the South Vietnamese into following the Marxist theory.<br />Socialism was brutally introduced to South Vietnam with eradication of private property, commerce and trade, and nationalization of the industry.<br />The chapter about religious suppression is particularly interesting: priests and monks opposing the new regime landed in jails or were sent to reeducation camps. Buddhists who were treated fairly leniently under the Thieu regime, were forever silenced. Politicians advocating a neutral Vietnam and communists opposing the Hanoi regime were also imprisoned. Basically no dissention was tolerated.<br />Millions of former military personnel and thousands of southern officials landed in reeducation camps with no set date for release. Millions of civilians were sent to new economic zones to work on virgin lands without tools, fertilizers, or even seeds. Their houses and belongings were confiscated and given to northerners who came in to administrate the conquered South.<br />This was not only a complete wipe-out of a democratic state, but also an overall socialist restructuring of the society. Alas, the experimentation turned out to be an utter failure and a quarter of a century later, the communists just hung on to power by force.<br />Although written in 1983, the book remains a classic and an excellent source of information for researchers and students alike.	2002-05-21

The forces, which have been pulling the Vietnamese community apart since 1920, came to a head-on battle in 1945-50.<br />During the 1954-1975 war, the northern yang being stronger and more refined than the southern one led to a northern invasion and collapse of South Vietnam. The hegemony and repression of the north, however, caused a violent reaction of the southern yin during the post 1975 years: exodus of hundreds of thousands of boat people, and refusal of farmers to participate in the collectivization of the agriculture causing a decrease in productivity. Those who could not escape survived by peddling their belongings at flea markets, which over a period of time grew into a vibrant capitalistic system thanks in part to the money sent home by relatives abroad, especially in the U.S. A decade later, the southern economy rebounded while the northern counterpart floundered. This led to a reversal of the dogmatic northern policy and implementation of the \\"doi moi\\" policy in 1985. <br />The author also suggests that happiness and prosperity cannot come to Vietnam unless true freedom and basic human rights are respected.<br />The American Library Association has voted \\"Understanding Vietnam\\" the 1994 Outstanding Academic Book.	2002-01-26

This New York Times reporter has won a Pulitzer Prize award for his reports on the boat people in the late seventies. The present book is a good review of postwar Vietnam from the reeducation camps, the differences between Saigon and Hanoi, the arrogance of the communists to the hope for a better future under the \\"doi moi\\" policy.<br />His interviews with Can Giao, a nationalist who has been imprisoned 21 times by all the different regimes, Duong Thu Huong (Paradise of the Blind), and Bao Ninh (The sorrow of war) are enlightening. All these people who are either former communists or sympathizers are presently not very happy with the communist regime. The author also believes that the 1975 diaspora represents the \\"severest judgment the Vietnamese had expressed about the communist regime\\".	2002-01-25

The author left Saigon right before its fall in 1975 and twenty six years later she is an author, a chef, and the owner of the Lemon Grass Restaurant in Sacramento, CA. In this book, she shares with us her ways of cooking Vietnamese foods.<br />Although her recipes appear to be simple and basic for a Vietnamese, they are not always straightforward for an American. What a native might find simple such as rolling an egg roll or preparing &quot;pho&quot; noodle soup could be very confusing for a foreigner. The best way to utilize this book (and any other cookbook) is to learn the basics from a native (Vietnamese in this case) before delving into the cooking of a complex meal.	2002-01-25

This is a very succint but adequate history of Cambodia, which started some 2,000 years ago with the Funan empire (1st to 6th centuries AD) and reached its peak with the Khmer empire (9th to 13th centuries AD) and its famous Angkor monuments. From then on, it was a steep downward slide into oblivion.<br />One just has to wonder how such a brilliant civilization could have disappeared even from the minds and memory of its own people. A Frenchman, Henri Mouhot, rediscovered the Angkor complex in 1860.	2002-01-25

The author was a North Vietnamese &quot;bo doi&quot; who was sent south to liberate Saigon. He participated in many battles in central Vietnam.<br />The world of the &quot;bo doi&quot; like that of any soldier was dominated by fears of death, desertion, drug use, and nightmares. Ghosts haunted them almost daily and forests scared them.<br />Despite their sacrifices, they did not get any recognition when they came home from the war: no drums, no music and had to resign to live with &quot;broken dreams and with pain&quot;. The stress of the war was too much for many of them: they got drunk, fought with their wives or girl friends, experienced nightmares, wild mood changes, and rage.<br />They suffered from the full range of post traumatic stress disorders American soldiers were experiencing on their return from the war. And above all, they questioned themselves whether the war was worth it.	2002-01-20

These are the views of seven people, Americans and Vietnamese, who in the early sixties contended that the US should pursue a counterinsurgency approach instead of a full conventional war against the Viet Cong, only to be brushed aside by the Johnson/McNamara group. They suggested that once the &quot;war for the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people&quot; was won, the communist threat should disappear.<br />Although I do not believe counterinsurgency war alone is the only valid approach because of 1) the presence of 200,000 Viet Cong left behind in South Vietnam by Hanoi in 1954, 2) the determination of Hanoi to conquer Saigon, 3) the opening of the Ho Chi Minh trail , this unconvential approach should have been tried first. Had it been combined with a complete interdiction of the trail, victory would have been more likely with less deployment of US troops.<br />What we have to remember is that the unique, and only goal of Hanoi was to conquer Saigon, no matter the cost in human lives and the time needed to achieve this goal.	2002-01-20

The author, born in England, spent three years in Vietnam as a correspondent for France press.<br />He characterized general Giap as &quot;ferociously driven, vain, indifferent to battle losses and to the suffering of his people&quot;. He talked about &quot;the poisoned and scorch earth left by American bombings&quot;, the sepulchral world of the Communist Party of Vietnam with &quot;its wild menagerie of fiefdioms, provincial power bases...&quot; and about greed, graft, and nepotism in Hanoi. He also mentioned about &quot;the melancholy tribe&quot; of the overseas Vietnamese and noticed Hanoi was &quot;never magnanimous in victory and tried to erase the very existence of South Vietnam.&quot;<br />When the communist Party claimed to represent the people he talked about &quot;an absurd act of ventriloquism&quot; and noted that communist Vietnam was slowly drifting into senescence.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-01-20

From 1975 to 1996, more than one million people have made the trip from Vietnamese shores to other Southeastern Asian countries braving weather, hunger, dehydration, storms, and pirates. About 500,000 others have drown or died at seas. In spite of these ordeals, these people keep rushing to the seas to flee communism. Had they had the means, the majority would have left their country.<br />    These are the stories of 19 people who left their homeland on rickety boats, their ordeals at seas, their lives in refugee camps, and their relocation in western countries. They risked their lives to look somewhere else for FREEDOM they could not find in their country.<br />    There are many waves of refugees throughout the years. People from the first wave were mostly professionals and went almost immediately to the U.S. or other western countries. Refugees from subsequent waves traveled in rickety boats, were less well schooled and spent a longer time in the Asian refugee camps.<br />    The authors are to be congratulated for bringing this topic to the forefront.	2002-01-13

The Vietnam War instigated by Ho Chi Minh caused 12 million people to be forcibly relocated: one out of two South Vietnamese had been a refugee at some point in their lives.<br /> Anti-communist ideology was the cause of the 1954-55 exodus during which one million left North Vietnam for the South. From 1966-72, artillery, bombing, communist repression forced peasants to leave their villages to migrate to cities. The atrocities of the Viet Cong during and after the 1968 Tet attack caused people &quot;to vote with their feet&quot;: they ran away as soon as they heard communists were coming. This was also the cause of the 1975 diaspora during which two million people escaped Vietnam on rickety boats. At least 500,000 others drowned or died from other causes at sea.<BR> <BR> The author who is to be congratulated for his in-depth analysis of this important problem.	2002-01-06

As an Anthropology student at the Australian National University, Taylor spent two years in South Vietnam (92-94), then returned to this country in 95, 98, and 99. Faced with a unique southern identity, he decided to define the &quot;idea of the South&quot;.<br />  North and South Vietnam despite decades of postwar communist control are two completely different countries from the political, social, economical, and even musical aspects. In the first decade after the 1975 fall of Saigon, the communists controlled everything down to the toothpaste the Vietnamese used. Faced with poverty and income loss, southerners began to peddle their cherished belongings to the black market in order to survive. While goods in state stores were scarce, everything was available on the black market. Goods and money sent home from overseas Vietnamese swelled this illicit economy. As a result, the southern economy rebounded. A southern reformist, Nguyen Van Linh spearheaded the doi moi (renovation) policy officially moving the country to free market economy. The &quot;modern&quot; South thus replaced the &quot;backward&quot; North.<br />  This unique southern free enterprise spirit did not sit well with Hanoi, which did everything to undermine it and ironically to profit from it at the same time. &quot;Corruption, abuses of power, and administrative incompetence&quot; became the hallmarks of communist Vietnam. However, the free southern spirit traced back to the pionering spirit of the South Vietnamese who settled in the Mekong delta some four centuries ago, lives on. If Saigon lost the war in 1975, it won the peace a decade later. Despite acknowledging past &quot;errors&quot;, the communists still refused to release their grip on power.<br />  The author is to be congratulated for his most interesting study and his keen observations of the South Vietnamese mind.	2002-01-06

In this book, the author wrote about the way women FEEL, then act. They in general act according to their heart and, most of the time, without any logic or reason. This book is about women's feelings, impressions,and fears but, not about hard scientific data. It, however, offers invaluable insight into the &quot;thinking process&quot; of women. The French scientist Pascal once wrote:<BR>  &quot;The heart has its reason,<BR>   that reason does not understand.&quot;<br />  The author, however, does not discuss the &quot;give and take&quot; situation in a relationship. Men who are goal oriented, need women to be loving, understanding, and realistic. They have different and sometimes contradicting priorities in their lives: spouse, children, work, religion, social and political interest/ambitions, but not necessarily in that order. And women should learn that they could not be number ONE all the time within this context, if they want the relationship to last for a long time.	2001-12-12
