This is what didn't work for me: 1)charcterization was lacking here. Lilly was a challenge to begin with since she was an assassin and Lucas was a fast car, fast life, fast women kinda guy who is divorced with two grown children who enjoys the adrenalin rush of the job. I didn't much like Lilly or Swain. 2)The unprofessional attitudes of the characters - each are described as professional but are not. Lucas Swain - coming from another assignment in South America, is ordered to bring Lilly in and does so but decides to have a fling with her first. This is a romance novel after all but I didn't care for it. 3) Repeated introspection - I was tired of reading repeatedly about Lilly's love for Zia. It was rather annoying. 4) The writing style of \\"telling\\" more than \\"showing.\\"<br /><br />Good points about the book were the 1)Paris setting and the 2)Prologue which was quite suspenseful and well done. A book fails entertain me when it doesn't have the most important elements of a first-rate novel: characterization and good plot and good dialogue. The dialogue here was fine but not great.<br /><br />My favorite Linda Howard novels in no order: Now You See Her, Open Season, Kill and Tell, Son of the Morning, Cry No More, After the Night and McKenzie's Mountain just to name a few. I am a Linda Howard fan but unfortunately, I didn't care for this book. Not recommended. My grade, C-/D+	2005-01-04

I enjoyed MONKEEWRENCH and the Monkeewrench crew who took center stage and helped Gino and Leo solve the Monkeewrench murders. In LIVE BAIT, the crew is more secondary and the story this time focuses on solving of the crime and trying to guess the culprit. Well, it wasn't that hard to guess the suspects. The authors didn't have many red herrings and certain secondary  characters just stuck out.<br /><br />What didn't work in this novel for me were several things 1) the withholding of information to build suspense. It didn't work here. The prologue and the last 25 pages were the most gripping. I skimmed the middle. 2)The story started to wander and become repetitive. More than half the book was read and there were still obvious holes in the plot that were not coming to light. At that time, I was disgusted and just started skimming. 3) Solving the crime took too long and the motive behind them were over the top. It was just unbelievable to me.<br /><br />The strength of the novel is in the writing but the problem was the disjointedness of the plot and that barely there presence of the Monkeewrench crew who are more on the periphery of the story this time around. What did I like about this novel? I liked the interactions between Grace McBride and Leo Magozzie. I hope their relationship will fill up the sagging middle section that was the problem with this book. I have high hopes that the next book will be better. My grade, C+. Overall, they had a great debut but a ho-hum follow-up. I'd like to see how they do with the third book before moving on to somebody else.	2004-11-14

It was good but the other books in the series were too cliched and predictable. ONDINE is a great example of a book that has a nice balance of mystery, romance and intrique. I did like the fact that the couple seem to work  together and communicate with each other and there didn't seem to be ridiculous plot contrivances for the sake of having one in the plot. I really enjoyed this novel and think it is a buried treasure of a read. Highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Other authors I would recommend: Kathleen Eagle, Laura Kinsale, Connie Brockway and Judith Ivory.	2004-08-06

After reading several historical mysteries, I chanced upon this copy and read it and enjoyed it very much. My grade is based on the fact that the author recreates the time period very well, the characterizations were top-notch, the plot had twists and turns that were not expected and after an initial slow start, the book does gain some momentum for the climax.<br /><br />If your a fan of historical mysteries, don't pass this one up. There are currently three books in the series that is published in the US. I promise you, that you when you finish reading this book, you'll want to find the other two novels and devour them.<br /><br />Authors who I think are similar: Ashley Gardner, Tracy Grant and P.B.

She writes believable characters, great dialogue and great suspense. INDELIBLE just proves once again that Slaughter knows how to write a mystery novel and has plenty of surprises in store for the reader. What I enjoy most about Slaughter's novels is that there are always disturbing issues that are in your face and realistic. Implausible? I don't think so. This woman writes about the ugly side of life that many people don't either know about or don't want to face. No matter how graphic or disturbing, her books are captivating reads. I like her voice and she is original and again, the real deal. She deserves blockbuster status for continuing to write and improve with each new book. I applaud you Ms. Slaughter for your consistent characterizations, realistic dialogue and an all around great read. I highly recommend this novel if characterization is important to you as well as realistic dialgoue and realistic plots/actions/scenes. One of the best female suspense writers around. Read her. You won't be disappointed. As for trying to compare her to other established writers - don't. She's in a class all by herself.<br /><br />Other authors I enjoy: Julia Spencer Fleming, Michael Connelly (who has praised Slaughter as well), Clinton McKinzie and last but not least, Anne Frasier.	2004-07-30

Theresa Weir has a &quot;style&quot; to her writing that is hard to compare with any other author. I miss her romances but her suspenses under Anne Frasier are very good and she seems to thrive and do very well in that genre.<br /><br /> This book was a quick read. The h/h had plenty of sexual chemistry/tension between them and the story/plot took unexpected twists and turns. The only problem I had was with the heroine's obsession with the voodoo doll that she received as a gift from her best friend. Her downfall at times was actually believing that Dylan loved her because of the voodoo doll. Otherwise, a quick read, a great find and a recommend.	2004-07-30

I found the characters compelling, the plot was interesting. This book was GREAT in that you had two very interesting leads with very interesting backgrounds and baggage. I was especially intrigued by ex-FBI agent, David Gould. Talk about a wounded soul. He was the big draw for me and the main reason why I loved this book so much. Elise Sandburg was just as interesting. Plot was good, great atmosphere with the vodoo and the black magic and spells. Loved that.

I had not enjoyed her previous Troubleshooters due to the WWII flashbacks and multiple storylines but with the focus on one storyline, the story did begin very slow. The plot of the book took too long to execute. Again, we have a secondary relationship that is slowly developing between Sophia and Deck who were more compelling and had more chemistry when compared to the principal characters Nash and Tess. I liked Tess. She was no nonsense and stood her ground but she was infactuated with Nash and 80% of the book has them going back and forth with their feelings along with the assignment that they are working together. Deck and Sophia had more electricity between them and their story promises to be a good one since Sophia has some baggage.<br /><br />The negative reviews could stem from the changes that Brockmann incorporated in her novel that worked for me: the one storyline and more action and suspense. The romance is secondary and there are no overlong sex scenes which is a plus for me. If Brockmann is aiming at suspense fans, I'd suggest she work on a plot that is more plausible and executable in a reasonable time frame. The mission in this book too long to excecute. The last 50 pages or so were more compelling that the previous hundred pages.<br />My grade, B and the reason is that after the initial beginning, the story did drag and I could put this book down and forget about it. I am glad to see that Brockmann seems to be concentrating more on the suspense and less on the usual conventions of romance. She just needs to work on the plot and lose the surfer dude voice which was quite annoying when you have everybody talking like that, it's distracting and if your writing suspense, you'd have to be rid of that first and foremost. A good book.	2004-05-11

Only about the last 1/4th of the book is devoted to the romance. But don't worry. You won't miss it. I had some LOL moments from this book. It is a great book. I'm buying another copy.	2003-11-27

I really enjoyed this novel as it now features Tommy T aka Thomas Warrior, now a famous comic strip writer. At an auction for White Bull's ledger drawings, Thomas finds himself competing with another fan of White Bull's drawings as well. As they compete, Thomas gives up and defeated, he leaves the auction a bit angry and bemused. Cassandra, after winning the ledger drawings for her gallery, is excited to have them and find them inspiring. The mysterious man who wanted them makes her curious about him. There is a spark between them but each go their separate ways after acknowledging each other after the auction.<br />Less than a month pass before Angela, Tommy T's adoptive mother asks him to mentor a friend's nephew. The aunt, Cassandra, of the said nephew happens to be none other than the woman who outbid him for the ledger drawings. Their mutual attraction sparks and sizzles. The trademark Eagle sexual banter flames up hot and intense between them all throughout the book. They made a great couple.<br />The suspense of the book was pretty strong. Someone threatens Cassandra and her nephew Aaron from the shadows. It is unexpected and the upcoming events tests the relationship between Cassandra and Thomas and involves an innocent little boy. The ending was touching. The secondary characters help round out the story. Jessie and Angela's romance is rather subtle. You assume that they are happy with each other but so much tension still exists between all of them with Tommy T. The past keeps rearing it's ugly head. Jessie tries to help when things start to heat up and eventually, the two men do come to terms with the past and I would like to think that their relationship is on the mend.<br />This was a great novel. A vast improvement over Eagle's last book. Ms. Eagle, we love your stories. We love that you take real life sometimes and create stories out of them.

This would be a great book to start with for those who have never read Catherine Asaro. In the prequel, Asaro gives us more background information or fleshes out the characters that helped establish The Ruby Dynasty, a family of psions who have the one advantage over their Eubian adversaries and that is acess to the web. It is this one advantage that keeps them from being completely destroyed. Roca and Eldri's romance is more in the forefront and the politics that so dominates the series as with the previous books plays a minor role here. We do learn more about Kurj and his relationship to his mother and the demons that continue to plague him along with his strenous relationship with his step-father, Edldri. I did like this book overall but wanted more depth, more complexity to the story that was presented here. For those readers who have never read Asaro, this would be the book to start with and for those who are already familar with the history of the Ruby Dynasty will learn nothing new in this book. I do look forward to TRIAD and hope it is a book with more depth and intrigue and suspense, all that was missing in this installment. My grade, C+.	2003-10-22

I've read in a week, Blood Work, The Black Echo, The Concrete Blonde and finished The Last Coyote. I decided to post my review and my feelings for his work up to this point. Connelly is a refreshing writer and an author I waited too long to read. What I enjoy about the series so far is his protagonist, Harry Bosh, a flawed, lonely cop who has a standard for his job that he sticks by: everybody counts or nobody counts. Another strength of the series is the focus on solving the case, the politics within the police department and the level of violence in his novels are not as bad as some of the writers I've come across.<br /><br />In THE LAST COYOTE, Connelly starts off with slowly, with the decision by Harry to investigate a case that is personal to him. As he slowly goes over the case and starts asking questions, he stirs up a hornet's nest of trouble. I love Harry Bosch. He only wants to do what is right. This book started off slow and picked up speed after the first three or four chapters. The ending was a complete surprise. Bosch was warned that the case would do more harm that good and it does cost Bosch emotionally. If I had to describe this installment in the series, it would be haunting.<br /><br />If you haven't tried Connelly yet, this is not where you want to start. I usually don't read books in order but with the Harry Bosch series, I highly recommend that you do read them in order. My grade, A. Thank You Mr. Connelly. You are an excellent author. So far, THE LAST COYOTE is the best of the series thus far. Reading order is below:<br /><br />The Black Echo (1992)<br />The Black Ice (1993)<br />The Concrete Blonde (1994)<br />The Last Coyote (1995)<br />Trunk Music (1997)<br />Angels Flight (1999)<br />A Darkness More Than Night (2001)<br />City Of Bones (2002)<br />Lost Light (2003)<br />The Narrows (2004)<br />The Closers (2005)<br />Echo Park (2006)<br />The Overlook (2007)<br />The Brass Verdict (2008)<br />Nine Dragons (2009)<br />The Reversal (2010)<br />The Fifth Witness (2011) (one page brief appearance)<br />The Drop (2011)<br />The Black Box (coming November 2012)<br /><br />provided by Michael Connelly's website.he Overlook (2007)<br />The Brass Verdict (2008)<br />Nine Dragons (2009)<br />The Reversal (2010)<br />The Fifth Witness (2011) (one page brief appearance)<br />The Drop (2011)<br />The Black Box (coming November 2012)<br /><br />provided by Michael Connelly's website.	2003-09-27

The story moves at a fast pace, never letting you go. A page-turner. If characterization and realistic dialogue are key to what you enjoy most out of your fiction, Slaughter is the author for you to try. I found her first book engrossing and her second book was a page-turner. The third is no different. She is an author to watch. I find her style unique and original. She is one of the few authors that I anticipate a new novel from and buy & read without reading reviews.<br />She is not overrated as some reviewers have stated. I find her voice refreshing and yes, the violence level was extremely high in this book but overall, it did not shadow my enjoyment whatsoever. Lena's still struggling to find peace within herself and might have stepped over the line in this installment. She meets her match in Ethan, who seems to identify with her on some level that only the two of them understand. The friendship and respect between Jeffrey Tolliver and Lena Adams is stretched thin here stemming from events from the previous installment and in this book as well. At times it was exhausting to see Lena's struggle to find herself, to come to grips with her past. Sara Linton and her ex-husband, Jeff Toliver are still together and might even be thinking of marriage again. Their romance is nice.<br />If this is your first time hearing of Karin Slaughter, this is not the book to start with and I recommend that you read them in order to get a better feel for the atmosphere, the characters. I am amazed that a few reviewers who posted seemed to think that the characters are unlikable. I don't agree. Slaughter is only one of the few writers who puts out thrillers with the emphasis on her characters. She gets great endorsements from authors I've enjoyed and respected like Michael Connelly who I just discovered this year and love.<br />My grade was an A. Outstanding follow-up to last year's KISSCUT and I look forward to INDELIBLE. If I had any problems with this installment---it was the violence. It was excessive and often I wondered if the author was trying to see how much she could gross us out as there were quite a few gross out moments. Overall, great book Ms. Slaughter. The series is very well written thus far. I only hope that the violence level is toned down in future books. Thank You.look forward to INDELIBLE.

I'm puzzled by the statements from readers claiming this to be her best book. I've enjoyed quite a few of Stuart's books, Night Fall and Shadow Lover to name a few but INTO THE FIRE was contemporary reader's nightmare. First of all, the heroine is TSTL= too stupid to live and Dillon was a so-so bad boy. I've read better. Many have argued that the heroine in this book is a basket case, go figure.<br />I thought ALOT of her actions were rather stupid. Driving to find Dillon who she SUSPECTS of murder, driving 1000+ miles in a car that could barely get to her to WORK. She gets there and then decides to LEAVE. Situation changes and she is forced to become a DETECTIVE (yes, there's a mystery in here, too). I love Anne Stuart. I want to read those gothics so I hope this book does well for her. Would I read her again? Sure. I personally thought this book was not her best effort. If your new to Anne Stuart, she does the BEST bad boys around but avoid this book or should I say, after reading this book and you find yourself disappointed, read some of her earlier suspense books like RITUAL SINS or NIGHT FALL. This book gets ZERO STARS from me.	2003-08-23

I tried to slow down my reading, savor the time I was spending with these characters but couldn't---I had to finish it and then go back and reread it again. This was an outstanding follow-up to last year's The Edge of Justice. Anton and his brother Roberto are back as are Anton's boss, McGee Ross and his lover, Rebecca. In this installment, Anton is bodyguarding a prosecuter from a stalker who seems to want to hurt her very badly. There are other subplots including his brother 'Berto who shows up to offer escape the only way the Burns brothers know how: climbing. Also, there is the trouble between Rebecca and Anton that in end seems a bit rushed to me;everything between them resolved a little too quickly. McKinzie will go very far with his writing and I look forward to his next novel. Run to get this book. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll love the second one. I read this book in a day if that says anything---wonderful page-turner. Highly recommend and my grade would be A-.

I had quit reading due to the ongoing predictable circumstances in this series. Roarke still is a billionaire who own everything in the world on/off planet and he will always be involved in Eve's cases and continues to provide Eve with the best sex she's ever had in her life. Without him, I guess we wouldn't have much a series (which I strongly disagree if more effort was put forth to make this series more original). In this installment, we learn more about Roarke's past, about a past he thought was true but turns out to be only a facade. When he investigates the truth about his heritage, he withdraws into himself and shuts Eve out. This is where the novel gets interesting in that Roarke almost always has Eve as his balance. In this case, he feels he must deal with this problem alone but Eve does aggressively knock down a few of the barriers that he puts up and together, they face the future and the truth and move on with their lives.<br />The usual characters from previous books make an appearance. McNab and Peaboy are still burning up the sheets and Sommerset still gives Eve eye-twitches. A good book and my last. I wish there was more depth to these characters but I guess you can't have everything. This is a great series but I just wish Robb would do more.	2003-03-09

Anton Burns is a breath of fresh air. He's not a supercop, but a mountain climber/peace officer in exhile. I can't wait to read the prequel to find out why he is in exhile. I recommend this book, highly. It was more realistic in that Burns went through ALOT of trials and tribulations and I loved that he wasn't some supercop who could control each and every situation he was in. Often, the injustices that occured were very fustrating to read but realistic regardless. I think this book would appeal to those who are tired of the same ole thing. Characterizations were strong and memorable. Look forward to his next book.<br />Keishon	2003-01-19

I loved Hingston's writing style and I look forward to reading her next book, The Affair. This was a great romance with memorable characters, highly recommend this book.<br />Keishon	2002-12-24

I loved the original version of this book and recommend that you find that one to read.<br /><br />I should have read the author's note which was at the back of the book and paid closer attention to the front cover that had &#34;revised&#34; on it because indeed, this novel is revised from the original novel that was released before Johansen went to bestselling stardom with her suspense novels. Before suspense, she wrote romance, historical romances at that and was pretty good at it. Since Long After Midnight and Ugly Duckling, she's now writing straight suspense.<br /><br />Reap the Wind is the third book in the Wind Dancer trilogy that is set in contemporary time. It has a very lovely romance in it with various love scenes that today, with the revised edition, the author saw fit to edit out a couple of them. Also, what's edited and changed are the actions of the characters from the original publication. As I was reading this book again (as I had bought a new copy to be put up with my other keepers) I started noticing differences that I didn't really care for and thus I quit reading it out of frustration and anger. I went back to find my original copy and indeed, the author made changes that really bothered this reader---a lot. Why certain scenes/characters/ending needed to be changed is beyond me and I didn't find that it was all that necessary but that's me. If you've already read this book, and had previously read this book when it was first published, you will be disappointed. If you've never read Johanssen, this book will not disappoint you. This book was a keeper for me so I was horrified that the author went back to make some key changes that affected plot and character.<br /><br />Reap The Wind is a favorite of mine so I strongly disagree with the changes/additions to please her suspense fans but to each his own. Just to note that this is a really big peeve of mine when authors go back to their previous books and make changes that they feel, may give them a wider audience, but meanwhile, you're angering your previous audience with the changes. Go figure. I'll still read Iris Johansen. I just didn't t like what she and her publisher did with Reap the Wind (1991) version.<br /><br />2015 Update: I noticed someone questions what could have been &#34;left out&#34; of the 1991 version since the page count went up. Let me clarify something. Iris Johansen edited out love scenes and she changed parts of her story and added extra stuff. That's why I titled this review as the &#34;revised edition.&#34; Some authors think it's okay to just &#34;revise&#34; an earlier publication and expand it and since I've read both, I know what changes she did and didn't much like it. Hope that this info helps.books and make changes that they feel, may give them a wider audience, but meanwhile, you're angering your previous audience with the changes. Go figure.

HUSH is dark and chilling and had my heart racing for practically the whole book. The characters were fleshed out and real. You can tell that Ms. Frasier has done her research. The detailed information she provides to make this seem real is very impressive. If your looking for a book that will make you sleep with your light on, I recommend you read this book if you like being held in suspense and never knowing what's going to happen next. This book was absolutely captivating. Not for the weak at heart and those who scare easily. Good Job Ms. Frasier!<br />Keishon	2002-05-19

One of those romances that make you feel ridiculously happy when you've reached the end of the story.  Also, Night into Day is a novel that deals with the serious subject of Rheumatoid Arthritis and gives you a glimpse of what it is like to live with this painful and unpredictable disease.<br />Alex Farrell has suffered from arthritis for 10 years and has been hurt by a previous lover who had managed to destroy almost all of her self-esteem but not her independence and will to move on and live her life.  Then enter Patrick O'Casey. Famous football player who is charming and cocky and did I say charming? He first sees Alex and is captivated by her smile and asks her to dance but he doesn't realize until it's too late that she has a cane and cannot dance.  Patrick makes many bloopers many of us would make when dealing with a disability we know nothing about or how much it limits your freedom to do what everyday normal people do and take advantage of.  I was touched and saddened by Patrick's stumbles and the awkwardness of having to face that Alex is different than everyone else but she's also a woman with feelings and needs like everybody else, too.  Patrick is much simpler than Alex in that he's looking for a woman who will search deep enough into his soul and fill in the void that no other woman has bothered to find or fill. He's drawn to Alex, to her strength, courage, her beauty and smile.<br />Patrick and Alex court and fall in love.  The only conflict is that Alex doesn't want to loose her independence and is always compromising and thinking of everybody else but herself.  She thinks that marriage is a &quot;drastic&quot; step and wants to leave the &quot;door open&quot; for Patrick if he so desires to leave her.  Patrick is hurt by this and tries to convince her otherwise.  Eventually, they both realize that they love and need each other and finally marry.<br />This book has one of the best endings I'd read in a long time.<br />I like the fact that Patrick thought of the implications of being involved with someone with a disability, the emotional ups and downs that would be involved. He realizes this and yet when his mind is made up and he accepts Alex, flawed and all and then he pursues her and falls in love with her. Patrick also doesn't hedge about his feelings.  Alex is the one who is hesitant to believe that someone would fall in love with her and the previous disappointment with love, you can certainly understand her hesitation and wariness.<br />My grade for this book is an A+.  It is OOP but worth tracking down.  If you see this book, grab it and read it. You won't regret it. This book sits on my keeper shelf.  Thank you Ms. Canfield for writing this extraordinary story of courage and love.<br />Keishonead in a long time.  <BR>I like the fact that Patrick thought of the implications of being involved with someone with a disability, the emotional ups and downs that would be involved.

The ending was just horrible. Why was it even necessary?  Overall, the story was good but not extraordinary and you really could wait for it in paperback.

This book has just about everything, history, passion, political intrigue, adventure, betrayal, secrets, and a tortured hero that you will come to love with all of your heart.  I took many things  away with me from reading wonderful, wonderful book: to appreciate my family and love &amp; live life to the absolute fullest.  Tania and Alexander make this book worthwhile to read over and over and over again.  A 600+ page book that took me three days and nights to read.  Plenty of reread moments in this book.  Believe me, you will not be able to put this book down.  Thank You Paullina Simons.  For you have written a beautiful story that soars.  I await the sequel.<br />This book is a keeper.	2001-07-20

I was no fan of Four to Score, Hot Six and now Seven-Up.  The marketing ploy with the cliffhanger at the end is ridiculous.  I'm afraid that this will be my last book. Also, I don't care for the direction she is going with this series, this love triangle between Morelli and Ranger needs to stop.  What started out as a mystery series has started out into something else entirely and I do not care for it.  Happy reading to those who have read something else while I wasted my time reading this. I highly recommend that you WAIT to buy this book in paperback. The best books in this series were the first three, and High five.  That is it.  I had such high hopes....such high expectations.....don't waste your money.	2001-06-22

It's easy to jump  on the bandwagon and say this book was terrible because everybody else said  so but I ask each of you that read this review: read the book and decide  for yourself.

A Whole Lot of Love was a very touching novel novel dealing with the issue of Alzeimer's disease and the heroine being a bit overweight.  I liked the fact that she made up her mind to accept her weight and demand that  everyone accept her for who she is.  Ethan is a wonderful hero who helps  her see her self-worth.

First, J.D.'s best is above average expectations, meaning that when she's average, she's still better than most. With that said, I've  also read all of the previous &quot;In Death&quot; books and find that  Loyalty in Death is just average.  I skipped several pages, the ending was  a bit too pat. Her best novels of this exceptionally wonderful series has  to be the first one, Naked In Death, followed by Glory In Death, Rapture In  Death.  I based that on the sleepless nights I had reading them. All the  others weren't bad.  I just didn't read them all in one sitting.  It's  takes a very talented writer to substain this type of momentum with their  readers giving them glorious reviews for each and every book.  What is  this? The 9th book? I'm impressed.	2000-01-30

I was truly impressed with this first effort by Annette Reynolds.  The characters are fully realized,the story was memorable. There were a few  scenes that I went back to reread.  This was an excellent novel, worth  finding and keeping.  On my nightstand sits Laura Kinsale's Flowers From  the Storm, Prince of Midnight, Karen Robard's One Summer and Annette  Reynold's Remember The Time.  Remember The Time had one of those satisfying  endings that left a grin on my face and a sense of everything is right in  the world attitude.  I reread the ending, often.

The characters were memorable and the plot is really nothing new but Eagle seems to make it work: the summer fling,the secret child that results but there's plenty of  other stuff going on as well. WHERE THE HEART IS is a great lovestory, full  of insight, passion and folklore.  The book doesn't really grab you until  your several chapters into the story.  The sexual banter between the hero  and heroine seems to be Ms. Eagle's trademark and you'll find it in almost  all of her stories. I enjoy it. Her characters  leap right off the page.  There are no silly conflicts to keep the lovers apart and several scenes  made me grin.  Some readers may find the folklore boring but I found that  it enriched the story. Also, the hero plays professional basketball! If  your not familiar with Kathleen Eagle, I wish there were words that I could  say to convince YOU to read her.&lt;G&gt;  And if your already familiar  with her work, you won't be disappointed.  WHERE THE HEART IS, is simply  one of the most beautiful lovestories of last year.  I am eagerly looking  forward to reading Ms. Eagles next masterpiece. And a note to  Ms. Eagle: I  hope we don't have to wait long! Ok, I've said all the nice things, now buy  this book! &lt;G&gt; Also, I **highly** recommend REASON TO BELIEVE and  SUNRISE SONG.	2000-01-18

My favorites are KISS AN ANGEL and NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE.  The latter story was a bit silly but it was funny.  I didn't care  for the hero in Dream A Little Dream.  Reminded me too much of Linda  Howard's earlier work, Sarah's Child, another story I didn't like by  another talented writer.  I couldn't finish this book, if that tells you  anything.  I thought the hero a jerk and just couldn't sympathize with him  despite the circumstances.  I just don't care for plotlines like this one  and will avoid them all in future.	2000-01-14

Hey, I didn't  want to but nothing was happening! Also, I didn't have any trouble liking  the characters.  Judith Ivory delivers as usual  but there were several  quibbles I had but none that would warrant any space here.  It's a good  story but if your asking me to compare this to her previous work like  BEAST, it doesn't come close to the excellence of that story.  The  characters are fleshed out, the dialogue--sharp, an all around feel good  read.  Did I mention the kissing? A lot of that.  Plenty of sexual tension  and as for sensuality, I'd say it is rather warm.&lt;G&gt;  Hope you enjoy!	2000-01-10

After reading the customer reviews, it's hard to believe that we  all read the same book!  Richard is one of the sexiest heroes I've come  across in awhile and Sweeney was a great heroine.  I loved them as a  couple. I think many of the people who enjoy a good book to read would not  be disappointed. Also I would like to mention that Sweeney's paranormal  powers were explained in the Epilogue.  I agree that there were a few loose  ends but it was nothing I cared about.
