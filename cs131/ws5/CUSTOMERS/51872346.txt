This is a cookbook like no other.<br /><br />Young Mo Kim began his adventures in baking when he was 17 years old. His passion brought him to pastry arts school. Before he was 30 years old, he opened his first bakery in Seoul, Korea. Currently, he has four bakeries and one cafe. Not only does he teach baking at culinary schools as well as to home bakers, he is also a celebrity chef on television. He is currently the president of the Korean Bakers Association. This is his third baking book, and the first one in English.<br /><br />Not only are there fantastic photos of the finished product for each recipe, but also photos of each stage of creation, totally over 1000 photos! I find this extremely helpful when trying a completely new recipe.<br /><br />Young Mo Kim's experience at teaching home bakers is quite evident. He explains the method to each recipe so well, anyone can try these recipes.<br /><br />Chapters included in this book are: Simple Delights (cookies, pound cake and more); A World of Bread (croissants, scones, bagels and more); Fantastic Desserts (tarts, souffles and more); Cakes for Special Occasions (genoises, sponges, cheesecakes and more); Valentine's Day (chocolate); Holiday Treats (yule logs, fruit cake and more); ingredients; and equipment.<br /><br />One of my favorite recipes is: Pumpkin Cake. It is very different from what we usually see. The cake is a layer cake with the cake part made of a pumpkin genoise. Instead of a cream cheese frosting, the cake is filled with a pumpkin mousse. It is topped with chantilly cream. The entire outside of the cake is covered in genoise powder and then utilizing a jack o lantern stencil and cocoa powder, there is a jack o lantern on the top of the cake!<br /><br />Another tidbit about this book is that there are Dream Character characters that offer tips and ideas throughout the book. It's like getting a tiny bit of anime on each page!<br /><br />For the home baker that is wanting an easy-to-read book that offers new ideas to baking your repertoire.

Capalbo has spent the past 10 years as the leading expert in Italian food.  With a passion for all things Italian and the occupational skills of a book editor, Capalbo spent three years in Southern Italy to research this digest.  Filled with color photographs, restaurant guides, wineries, gourmet shops, history and explanations of Italian cooking, Capalbo has shown us an Italy that only a native would know.  The author's love and enthusiasm for Italy can be felt within this guide through her thorough and complete explanation of the region's food as well as her fervor for Southern Italy.  There is no other comparable work available, so this almanac is an excellent addition to all libraries.	2005-09-01

She decided to write a book about what she fed her children.<br /><br />She has some very good ideas for parties, healthier versions for fruit snacks, great manners in which to prepare baby food and offers loads of information about each fruit and vegetable. The advantages for making your own baby food are you can control what goes into the food. This is wonderful if you have children with allergies. Also, you can control the texture. When I fed my children homemade baby food, they seemed to adapt quicker and easier to new foods and table foods much easier than their friends who ate from store brands. Despite that my children are picky like everyone else's, they love fruits and vegetables and I get comments all the time on how well they eat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite the wonderful potential this book has, it is also loaded with extra misinformation. Ruth Yaron recommends feeding nut butters as early as ten months of age. Most pediatricians (if not all) do not recommend giving children any food considered a high allergen until they are older. Imagine having an infant suffering from an anaphylactic reaction? Would you be able to identify one? Or would you feel safer following your doctor's advice and wait until your child is older where the symptoms would be easier to recognize? Also, she suggests feeding spinach and carrots early as well. Depending on where you are getting your spinach and carrots, they can be loaded with chemicals.<br /><br />What adds to all of the misinformation in this book is the fact she writes with a patronizing attitude and has absolutely no official training outside of parenting. She is not a nutritionist, nor is she a dietician, and she is not even a doctor!<br /><br />Then, as if that was not enough, she strays off topic from her book's title, Super Baby Food and suggests tie dying stained onesies, not owning an iron in the house as it may be too dangerous, making your own crayons, a section on bibs, and how to clean your house. Some readers may find this extra information as a bonus. I found this to be an annoyance. If I wanted a book on how to clean my house, I would have bought one. I wanted a book on feeding my baby. What she may have considered was renaming this book to suggest that these types of suggestions were included in this book, or come up with a second book.<br /><br />Parenting is a tough job. No one wants to be told that what they are doing is wrong. Each child does not come with his own instruction manual. Then, you get this book where Ruth Yaron preaches her beliefs and basically infers if you do not raise your children her way, then you are not being a good parent. After reading this book, it would be really hard for any mother not to take her tone personally.<br /><br />If you are an intelligent person who can sift through the information in this book, listen to your doctor and use your instinct for raising and feeding you child, than this is a good book. But, if you are a person that believes everything in print, and you plan to follow this book like it is the Bible, then this book could be dangerous to you.<br /><br />My suggestion is for someone who is a registered nutritionist get together with a pediatrician, and revise this entire book. There are too many people out there that take everything at face value and do not research on their own. Having a book like this on the shelves was a wonderful idea yet it was poorly executed.tie dying stained onesies, not owning an iron in the house as it may be too dangerous, making your own crayons, a section on bibs, and how to clean your house.

Library Journal<br /><br />Wild (The East India Company) has been widely recognized for introducing specialty coffees to Great Britain. Here, he presents a 500-year history of the much-loved drink, drawing on science, politics, anthropology, and alchemy before concluding that today's large companies, with their demand for lower prices, have put coffee farmers out of business and thousands of workers out of jobs in Africa and Central America. Wild's explanation of how major corporations have taken over the coffee industry, supported by public information direct from the coffee distributors themselves, will inspire readers to comtemplate their contribution to this global situation. The only comparison would be Stewart Lee Allen's The Devil's Cup, which describes similar facts but from the first person. With its political and historical perspectives, this book reads more like a textbook. Recommended for academic libraries; an optional purchase for others.-Jennifer A.

He travels from Kentucky to Madrid to Brooklyn, NY, regaling readers with stories and mouth-watering recipes (e.g., Porchetta, Burgundy Style). Meanwhile, Kaminsky reveals a disquieting fact: the industry has changed processing procedures to market large quantities-the end result of which has only compromised flavor and our health. Kaminsky's passion and love of pork is reminiscent of Peter Mayle's fervor for food and the south of France (see A Year in Provence).

Ingredients, kitchen tools and step-by-step methods are pictured to help children understand how to create each meal. This book is very easy-to-understand and is set up for beginner cooks.<br /><br />Another thing that I enjoyed about this book was the way that there were a variety of protein sources, whether it be vegetarian, lamb, chicken or red meat.

He used to be the executive chair of the International Association of Culinary Professionals Foundation from 1997 to 1998. He has written five additional books on Cajun cuisine: Cajun Healthy, Cajun Quick, La Cuisine Cajun, La Meilleure de la Louisiane: The Best of Louisiana (sp), and New American Light Cuisine.<br /><br />Through his love of Cajun cuisine, and adapting some American favorites, Theroit wanted low-carb dieters to learn and enjoy the food he loves best, Cajun! Each recipe in this book lists serving size, total carbohydrates per serving, net carbohydrates per serving, and calorie count. While creating this cookbook, Theroit lost more than 100 pounds.<br /><br />The recipes are easy-to-read and utilize simple ingredients including Cool Whip, Tabasco Sauce, Equal and Splenda. I could not find any unusual ingredients, except soy flour, which is available in most grocery stores. You may just need to look in the natural food section. There are no photographs or illustrations.<br /><br />Some nice recipes that we enjoyed were: Just Tomato Salad, Grilled Flank Steak and the Chocolate Mousse.<br /><br />This book was nice, but a few photographs would have helped sell some of the recipes in this book. Also, knowing yet another person has jumped on the \\"low-carb\\" bandwagon was a bit frustrating, despite understanding that Theroit just wants to share his love for Cajun food.	2005-05-20

He has authored a total of six books, four of which are about New Jersey.<br /><br />New Jersey is not all that most people think. Yes, it is one of the smallest US states, being 47th in size, yet 9th in population. Also, yes, New Jersey is known for chemical products, electrical equipment and being a suburb of New York City. But did you know that New Jersey is also known as the \\"Garden State\\"? That New Jersey also relies on tourism and their agriculture as part of their economy? Anyone who has lived in New Jersey or has travelled here a lot knows about Jersey tomatoes, their wonderful fresh seafood and how New Jersey has the best diners, and even makes award winning wines!<br /><br />The book is divided into four sections: North Jersey, Central Jersey, South Jersey and the Jersy Shore. Each of these sections has information on numerous delicious places to find the food of New Jersey, such as Made Here; Specialty Stores & Markets; Farmers' Markets; Farm & Farm Stands; Food Happenings; Learn To Cook; Learn About Wine; Landmark Eateries; Brewpubs & Microbreweries; and Wine Trails.<br /><br />There are no photographs in this guide, only drawings.

The recipes were very easy-to-read and understand. They were extremely straight-forward. The only trouble with the recipes are if you do not live in an area to find yourself rabbit, venison, squab, grouse, quail, or pheasant. But, for me, the book is worth it anyway. The recipes also indicate the cultural heritage of its people: Romanians, Sioux Indians, Poles, Germans, Austrians, Scandinavians, Hungarians, Russians, Czechs and more.

Unfortunately, I found a LOT of sugar to be in the recipes.  I realize this book is entitled \\"Beyond Low Fat Baking...\\" thus indicating that it had cut back on the fat, and \\"...Cancer Fighting Foods For The Millennium\\" indicates the soy, but all that sugar is not healthy either.  So many people have Type II Diabetes, and everyone in the US seems to be overweight, I wish she addressed this issue as well.<br /><br />The recipes I tried were very flavorful and tasty.  In fact, there was a delicious recipe for a Spice Cake in there that my family loved.<br /><br />If sugar is not an issue for you, then pick this book up.  But if you need to cut back on the sugar, and you do not know how to do that on your own, then do not get this book.	2005-03-08

He used to be a director of commercials and music videos, but his passion for food took over, and sent Brown and his wife to Vermont, where he attended culinary school. Upon completion, he decided to use his media experience and make a cooking show that was entertaining and educational.<br /><br />By analyzing the process of baking through science, Alton Brown creates wonderful baked goods. His recipes are easy-to-read, easy-to-prepare, and the scientific reasoning behind each process makes so much sense. Knowing what is happening when I am making cookies helps when I am preparing a family favorite recipe and modifying it from Alton Brown's study!<br /><br />Like Alton Brown's previous books, there are no color photographs, but rather, sketches and side notes hinting at Alton Brown's witty sense of humor seen on his television show.<br /><br />You have to try the cherry scones! They are fantastic!<br /><br />This is another fantastic book by Alton Brown, and should be added to your collection!	2005-02-20

If you enjoy what you create with their product, not only will you continue to purchase it, you will tell someone else about their product too.<br /><br />This cookbook has developed over 400 cookies from nine basic processes. There are common cookies, and unusual cookies. I was very fortunate to get to review this book over the holiday season, where I could try many of the recipes and share the results. I even found a recipe for \\"alfajor\\" which is a cookie from South America. Having lived in Argentina for a time, I used to eat alfajores with dulce de leche, and here, in this wonderful book, is the recipe! My family also adored the Light Spice Cookies (a cross between a sugar cookie and a gingerbread cookie) and Magic in the Middles, a chocolate cookie with peanut butter in the middle (one definitely for the peanut butter cup fans)!<br /><br />My suggestion to all is get rid of any other cookie books you have, like I did, and make room for this one as a part of your permanent collection.

In this cookbook, there are 250 delicious recipes that can satisfy your appetite while utilizing the low-carb theory.<br /><br />Karen Barnaby is a chef in Vancouver. She began to have weight problems, and decided that a low-carb diet made sense to her. So, she began to use her culinary knowledge and develop wonderful tasting recipes that were low in carbohydrates. Through her efforts, she lost 70 pounds. Due to her success in weight loss, she decided to write this cookbook, her sixth book.<br /><br />In this hardback book, there are color photographs which show a lot of the delectable recipes offered in here. Each recipe is also written in metric and imperial, so there are no conversions needed for a person who is accustomed to the opposite in measurements. In the introduction, Ms. Barnaby gives us a wide variety of ingredients that can help make meals flavorful and exciting. She shows us through her recipes, which prove that because you are eating a low-carb meal, it does not mean that you cannot have a wonderful meal filled with flavor!<br /><br />And if you needed more information about this book, then you need to know that Ms. Barnaby has even included a section which provides the carbohydrate/fat/protein/caloric information needed for each recipe. The Table of Contents includes recipes for: breakfast, appetizers, soups, salads, vegetables, fish, poultry, beef, pork, lamb, sauces and desserts.<br /><br />If you are on a low-carb diet, then you will be consuming Splenda. My doctor tells me that Splenda is actually a brand name for sucralose which is made from sucrose. It is 600 times sweeter than sugar and is not caloric. It was approved by the FDA in 1998 and is everywhere! In over 110 studies made on sucralose, there were apparently NO indication of toxic effects in humans or animals, and has been deemed safe for human consumption. From a food science perspective, when utilizing straight Splenda, and not a combination of sugar and Splenda, then baked goods will not brown as effectively. But, if you are diabetic, then I am sure that a pale cookie is no problem when you think of no cookie at all.<br /><br />The recipes in this book are straight-forward, easy-to-read and easy-to-prepare. Ms. Barnaby does not use culinary terms that only a chef would understand. I would like to caution some cookbook buyers that there are some unusual ingredients that most homes in the United States and Canada do not utilize on a regular basis: tuna steaks, miso, capers, tofu, albumen powder, nori, flax (and more).<br /><br />Many times, in cookbooks that offer low-fat, low-carb, vegetarian recipes, the recipes introduce us to international cuisines, or at least, international ingredients. At first, many people are not interested in taking the next step in trying the recipes, but I can assure you, that if you recover from the idea that you will be eating a daikon, then you will realize that the recipe for Daikon Radish, Chinese Cabbage and Tofu Soup is actually delicious!<br /><br />There are also some vegetarian recipes in here utilizing tofu, such as Tofu-Roni and Cheese. Other delicious recipes offered in this book are: Kristine's Asparagus and Brie Frittata, Winter Vegetable Soup, Green Beans With Eggs and Nutmeg, Dark Chocolate Bars and Zucchini Cake.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I prefer to cook from fresh ingredients, rather than cans or packages. I like trying new ingredients and expanding on my current menus.

My most recent discovery is from the Science Fiction / Fantasy section of the bookstore, \\"Nanny Ogg's Cookbook\\" by Terry Pratchett. The author of the book is the author of a fantasy series entitled Discworld, where elves and witches inhabit the world, with a largely satirical approach. Nanny Ogg is one of Discworld's main character witches. The cookbook is very funny and mainly British cuisine, which may explain why this book was so hard to find in the USA. The recipes are entirely in metric and some of the ingredients would be unknown to the average American cook. Yet, the book is lovely! There is even a section on the table manners of dwarves, pixies, trolls and scarecrows! Some of the recipes in this book that you may be interested in trying are: Mrs. Gogol's Clairvoyant Gumbo, Traveller's Digestives, Strawberry Wobbler and Sergeant Angua's Vegetable Stew With Dumplings. If you are a fan of Discworld, or are interested in an amusing, yet interesting stab at being a cookbook, then try this one.	2005-02-17

One day, having been smitten with Provence, France for a long time, I discovered the Travel Literature section of my local bookstore. I found a book entitled \\"A Year in Provence\\" by Peter Mayle. This book chronicles the author and his wife's move from their home in England to Provence, France. The book, broken down by the months of the year, tells us what the Mayles encountered whether it be people, customs, food or weather. The book is quite amusing as Mayle describes the French as well as he and his wife's innocent, naive approach to the Provencial way of life. Throughout the book, Mayle describes delicious foods that only the French could have developed. The description of the food and Provence made me want to travel there! Oh! How I would LOVE to go to France! If you are interested in French food, check out this book! It is a quick read, and very entertaining.	2005-02-17

Being a fan of Fine Cooking magazine myself, I am excited by their new innovative yet simple recipes that bring forth great meals and leave behind the boring meals of the past!<br /><br />This new bestseller brings forth a new rage, the self-titled, Cooking New American. This book is not about America's past of meatloaf and dried pot roast, but new, creative meals. Lovely recipes such as Truffle-Scented Cornish Game Hens with Proscuitto and Wild Mushrooms, and Couscous with Ginger, Orange, Almonds and Herbs, are throughout this book.<br /><br />This cookbook is beautifully photographed. The dishes look so tantalizing that one feels compelled to try some of these inspirational recipes! The recipes are easy-to-read and easy-to-prepare. Alongside any moderately-complicated recipe, there is a picture guide of what you are looking for whilst preparing your new meal.<br /><br />If you are used to traditional American cuisine, and not ready for this new trend, then this book may come as a surprise with the ingredients. For me, it was refreshing to see ingredients such as porcini mushrooms, proscuitto, hazelnuts and more. But for others, it may be a deterrent.<br /><br />For fresh, new ideas, pick up this cookbook. It would make a nice addition to your collection, as well as a wonderful gift.	2004-12-20

Through the riches of our country, we can afford more meat, dairy products and processed foods; thus, contributing to our poor health, \\"over-nutrition\\", otherwise known as the Western Diet.<br /><br />Erik Millstone works at the University of Sussex in Science Policy. He has been working on food-related issues for almost 30 years. Tim Lang is a professor of food policy at City University in London. He is, also, a consultant to the World Health Organization. With the aid of Axel Drescher, a professor of Applied Geography at Freiburg University, they have formulated this educational book about \\"who eats what, where and why\\".<br /><br />While rich industrialized countries thrive in excess and develop diseases from over-consumption (such as, diabetes), these countries are also feeding a bulk of our grain to feed livestock, when over 40 million people a year die of starvation.<br /><br />This book is filled with statistics, bar graphs, charts and miscellaneous graphics that help aid in our understanding of food's role in modern life. The book is divided into five parts: Contemporary Challenges (feeding the population, environmental challenges, disease, nutrition and more); Farming (mechanization, genetic modification, pesticides, sustainable farming and more); Trade (animal transport, fair trade, tariffs and more); Processing, Retailing and Consumption (staple foods, Organic food, fast food, alcohol and more); and World Tables (agriculture and comsumption).<br /><br />This is not a cookbook, nor a glamorous journey through each country's cuisine, however.<br /><br />Upon studying this book, I ponder the ideas of vegetarianism for a healthier way of life, and as an objection towards the feeding of livestock in lieu of providing grain for starving nations. I, also, think of how we have looked for ways on simplifying our lives with remote controls, garage door openers, email, kitchen appliances, washers and dryers, and how ultimately, we have complicated it more. This reminds me of a movie I once saw: The Gods Must Be Crazy. Although this movie takes on a more comedic approach of two wildly different cultures in South Africa, still it does demonstrate what both cultures have gained and lost due to industrialization.<br /><br />Information found in this book can help educate the reader on how the food on their plate came to be and at what cost to society. For anyone that eats, and that is everyone, we should all read this book and become more educated on how we are contributing, both positively and negatively, to our society.en appliances, washers and dryers, and how ultimately, we have complicated it more.

If you are looking for a gourmet cookbook, but you are a beginning cook, then I may have found your book!<br /><br />Noel Tyl has had a long career as an astrologer, and an opera star! I have to admit, when the publisher approached me to review this book, I was hesitant. I like reviewing good cookbooks, and I wasn't sure that an opera-singing astrologist could really cook! But, I was wrong.<br /><br />This cookbook features over one hundred recipes for health-conscious people. The recipes are simple to understand and easy to prepare. They are designed for everyday meals, quiet dinners for two, and other festive occasions. If you are a beginning cook, but would like to prepare your recipes with fresh ingredients in lieu of packaged products, then The Sophisticated Gourmet is the cookbook for you.<br /><br />The ingredients are easy-to-find. I was able to find mine at the local grocery store. So, there is no need to order any supplies online or find a gourmet shop, if you have one in your area.<br /><br />There is a decent sized index with tips explaining what pantry items to keep in stock, as well as how to cut vegetables, herbs to choose, how to check for doneness and much more.<br /><br />On the downside, if you are a person that needs photographs in a book, unfortunately, they are not here. There are quite an abundance of drawings! And the recipes are so easy to prepare, I believe that despite a beginning cook's skill level, that you would be able to prepare your meals without photographs documenting every stage of the cooking process.<br /><br />Due to Noel Tyl's careers, astrology and opera, he has had the opportunity to travel all over the world, hence sampling international cuisines! Some of the delicious recipes you will encounter in this book are: Chocolate Pound Rum-Cake, St. Gertrude's Lobster Soup, Crispy Duck & Bean Salad With Peanut-Sesame Dressing, Royal Hunt Roasted Pork Tenderloin, plus many more. And as you may be able to tell, this is definitely a meat-eater's book. There are some vegetarian recipes, but you would need to be an extremely innovative cook with your tofu to utilize the majority of the meat recipes.<br /><br />So, if you would like to try innovative recipes designed for the novice skill level, written in an easy-to-read manner, than Noel Tyl's The Sophisticated Gourmet is for you!

As &quot;Good Eats&quot; success began to blossom, Alton decided to try his hand at a book. As fans began to wait in anticipation of &quot;I'm Just Here For The Food: Food + Heat = Cooking,&quot; it was assumed that this book would be a take off from his show &quot;Good Eats&quot;. However, it is not, but does show you what Alton enjoys most of cooking - the science, the understanding of what goes on in the kitchen.<br />The book's chapters are divided into cooking processes, such as grilling, braising, microwaving and more. In each chapter, he explains the type of heat, what method is best for applying this heat and some recipes as examples. By understanding the heating process, and thus, the science behind cooking, the more in control of each meal or recipe you will be.<br />He explains scientific terms in a manner in which a layman can understand. He also explains those unspoken rules to cooking that most cookbooks do not explain, either from the assumption that you went to culinary school too, or because the writer did not know these rules either.<br />His usual humor and wit is ever present in this book. In fact, you feel like Alton is actually reading the book to you! He uses his own terms for things, such as &quot;software&quot; (food), &quot;hardware&quot; (pots, pans, and utensils) and &quot;application&quot; (cooking process). He even has funny diagrams and photographs in case you wanted an extra chuckle.<br />Also included in this book is an explanation of ingredients, such as the varieties of butter: unsalted, clarified, whipped, buttermilk and margarine. So, if you were at all confused, you will no longer be.<br />At the end of the book, he includes recommended reading, so we can be just as smart as he is, plus places to purchase our food and supplies!<br />And not only was this a great book, it received a James Beard Award in 2003 for the Best Reference Book! So, you just have to buy it now, because! Seriously, if you want to understand more about what is going on in your kitchen, and how to enjoy your cooking, buy this book!just have to buy it now, because!

In this wonderful gem, Alton Brown explains how you can declutter your kitchen within 60 days and stock your kitchen with useful tools that you will actually use!<br />As any &quot;Good Eats&quot; fan will tell you, Alton Brown believes in &quot;multi-taskers.&quot; His logic is: Why have a yogurt maker when you only use it once a year? Instead, he shows us, on one of his shows, how he utilizes a heating pad and a couple of canisters to achieve the same results.<br />Not only does he suggest unusual items for your kitchen (a cigar cutter to chop chives), but he also recommends traditional items. He explains the process with which one should consider before purchasing any item. He does explain how he chose that certain coffee maker, but he explains how we need to figure out which one is best for us.<br />Being as he is forever in search of a great utensil or appliance, he is quick to point out which items are more difficult to clean, and not worth buying, and which ones are worth buying. In the section devoted purely to pots and pans, he explains each metal used for cooking, the best uses for that metal, how to care for it and the good and bad points with each metal.<br />Instead of purchasing that expensive imported terra-cotta cookware, he suggests (with diagrams) on how to create your own cookware from flowerpots...I mean, they are both made from the same material. Why pay more because one says &quot;cookware&quot;?<br />And he doesn't stop there. He also helps his readers by helping them select safety and sanitation supplies for their kitchens!<br />And if you thought that was not enough, he has a large resource section, in the back of the book, where he recommends some excellent places to purchase your items, either through mail, telephone or Internet!<br />This book is complete with Alton Brown's sense of humor, wit and enthusiasm. He is one of the only people out there creating books for people who never went to culinary school. I appreciate his thoroughness, and recommend this book to all new cooks, and for the more seasoned chefs as well.se of humor, wit and enthusiasm.

One of the authors approached me in November 2002 and noticed how I had not reviewed their book yet at Amazon.com. Through my information, they found the articles I have written at Suite 101, and there, also, I had not indicated once about their book \\"Food FAQs\\". Confidently, Linda Resnik offered me a copy of their book in exchange for a review. I accepted.<br />When the book first arrived, I noticed that it was small, and organized into 3 sections: Substitutions, Yields and Equivalents, and an Index, which fully cross-references. At a first glance of the book, I saw how functional this book was. Everything was alphabetized, with hard-to-find ingredients also included.<br />After 25 years of cooking experience (16 of those on a regular basis), I was very curious if this book would really work. Of course, I had to put it to the test. My first test, conveniently showed up the day the book arrived. I was planning on making a yogurt pumpkin pie and had just discovered that I forgot to buy the yogurt. I used their easy-to-use reference guide, and found that the substitution for yogurt was buttermilk. This was great, but I was leery, as one of the major ingredients in the recipe for this pumpkin pie was the yogurt. Well, I continued on my way, and prepared the pie as the recipe recommended. Later, my husband and I taste tested the results. My husband said, \\"This is delicious!\\" Being a man with challenging palate, I found this very rewarding, and I agreed to make this pie again for Thanksgiving! My next mission was that of \\"lotus root\\". One of my friends has only been in the USA for barely a year. She is from Japan and made me this rice salad. Being pregnant, I was craving this wonderful concoction! But I could not find the lotus root in the grocery store. I looked up the ingredient in this handy reference book to discover that the authors feel like water chestnuts would be an adequate solution. I was also very pleased with the results here.<br />When I ventured to the Equivalents and Yields section. I, again, was impressed at my first glance. Not only does it explain how much one onion makes when chopped, but also once it has been cooked. This makes shopping easier for the less experienced cook who has no idea what that might require!k to discover that the authors feel like water chestnuts would be an adequate solution.

I have a taste for sweets, yet I try to eat healthy. Now, with a toddler in the house, I am becoming more aware of family illnesses that can be hereditary. So, my interest in eating healthy has become more serious, as I try to raise my son to eat better than my husband and I did growing up.<br />This book is quite large. It stands about 15 inches tall, and has 512 pages filled with advice on food allergies, diabetes, arthritis, cancer prevention and heart disease. The information is easy to read and understand. It helps explain what you need to do to help increase your health with these illnesses. With diabetes, heart disease and arthritis in my family, I find the information extremely useful. With lactose intolerance in my husband's family, I find the information invaluable. In raising my son, I do not restrict his intake of a specific food item, but I am using the information from our family history and trying not to give him an excess of food items that can ultimately make him ill.<br />The book contains over 300 recipes. With each recipe comes a guide, which indicates whether that particular recipe is gluten-free, wheat-free, corn-free, dairy-free, nut-free, shellfish-free, egg-free, yeast-free or Soya-free. Also, with each recipe, is a breakdown of the nutritional content: calories, fat, protein, carbohydrates, fiber and sodium. This information is invaluable! How many times have you found a recipe and did not really understand that it actually did have a high fat content! With this book, you do not have to wonder, as the information is all there!<br />&quot;Healing Foods&quot; is also loaded with photographs. Not only do you get gorgeous photos of the end result of the recipes, but there are also preparation photos.

And most cookbook buyers know how to read a recipe, yet do not understand it.<br />King Arthur Flour is a company that has been in business for over 200 years. It is their business to know flour, and to understand how to use it. It is also to their benefit to educate their flour buyers in how to bake better, so they will be happier with the end product, and thus buy more flour and even recommend their flour to their friends. In their latest book: The King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion: The All-Purpose Baking Cookbook they explain why you need to sift your flour (it adds air to the mixtures which aids in leavening), why French Toast bread should be stale, why you only fry in certain oils and much more. They also offer recipes for virtually everything; from breakfast foods to quick breads, from doughnuts to yeast breads, from cobblers to cookies and cakes, as well as pies and quiches. This book even offers a section on which kitchen tools are the best for your baking projects: from type of chocolates to pie pans. This is a must-read section for any baker.<br />This cookbook is designed for 90% of the cookbook buying population. This cookbook is fantastic as now you can understand what you are doing rather than just following directions. When you decide to make modifications to your recipes, now you will know what parameters you must maintain if you want your recipe to turn out. For example, almond oil will not work when frying doughnuts, as it has a very low smoke point.<br />For the price of this book, you get more than what you are paying for.

Anna Maria Volpi takes us on a culinary journey through her native Italy and teaches us about each region's history of food, cooking, its influences and offers delicious recipes.<br />Anna Maria Volpi began cooking in her native Italy while still a youngster. She learned how to prepare wonderful dishes from fresh ingredients. Her heritage is mainly Roman and Sicilian, but learning about cooking opened her up to a new world, where food would become her passion. After migrating to the United States, she became an accomplished teacher in the field of cooking traditional Italian food from fresh ingredients, prepared in the simplest ways. She frequently is a guest instructor at Williams-Sonoma.<br />With the aid of her husband, Pietro, who did a lot of research for the history portion of the book, &quot;The Timeless Art of Italian Cuisine&quot; takes us on a culinary journey. The chapters in this book are for each region in Italy. The history of that region is explained, as well as any outside influences, which may have affected the food at the time. Then, recipes from that region are offered. She also explains how some of Americans' favorite Italian dishes are merely American adaptations. For example: spaghetti and meatballs, macaroni and cheese, pepperoni, veal parmigiana and pasta primavera. Each recipe is easy to prepare and not very time consuming. The measurements are in imperial and in metric, which is useful for anyone who typically needs to make metric conversions for their cookbook. Some of excellent recipes contained in this book are: how to make fresh pasta, polenta, biscotti, focaccia, lasagna, cannoli, pizza and many more, making a total of 170 scrumptious recipes!<br />I truly enjoyed this book. I would strongly recommend this book for all Italian food lovers, as well as anyone interested in learning the art of Italian cuisine. The book is easy to read, and the recipes are simple to prepare. The food is delicious. The history of Italy is daunting with how long their history is in contrast to America. With the holiday season approaching, pick up a couple of copies of this book.

This book is excellent to the beginner cook in Indian cuisine.<br />I found that the recipes were easy-to-understand and the ingredients were easy-to-find. Ms. Bhide also provided a list of sources in case you live in an area where you cannot find the ingredients. She also provides a substitution guide. For example, if you cannot find amchoor (mango powder), then you can use lemon juice instead!<br />There is also a section on the description of common herbs and spices used in Indian cuisine, as well as what types of food are found in each part of India and who influenced them. I found this very interesting.<br />Delicious recipes you will find in this cookbook are: Peppered Cauliflower Florets, Dry Chile Chicken, Fiery Pork, Coriander Layered Potatoes, Saffron Fruit Custard and Watermelon Juice.<br />With over 150 recipes to choose from, the list of resources to find your ingredients, sample menus, healthy alternatives and much more, who could refuse to learn more about Indian cooking with Monica Bhide's cookbook!	2003-11-10

Her examples of dreams are real and her conclusions make a lot of sense.<br />If you are looking for a book on how to intrepret your dreams, pick up this one, as it is more thorough and covers more than every other book I have found out there.	2003-09-15

I decided, after owning this original cookbook for 2 years, and after seeing the revised version, that I would write a revised update of my book review, to remind people of what a great cookbook that exists out there!<br />This cookbook is divided into seasons. When I first became interested in eating with the seasons, I found this book to be an excellent advantage to actually offer menus for each season. Within each season, is a section for appetizers, main dishes, beverages and desserts. There are also sample menus for gatherings.<br />Despite the fact, I am not a vegetarian, I have enjoyed the recipes from this book as part of a more healthy approach to eating. Also, some of the main dishes can be utilized as a side dish for a meat-eater, or you can add meat to most of those dishes. All the dishes are easy to prepare, and the ingredients are easily found in any grocery store.<br />This cookbook does contain a goddess twist. There are Celtic festivals to celebrate and ways to honor a certain goddess with that dish. Even if you are not a Pagan, this book is exciting because the Pagans are known for living at one with the Earth. So, who better to find out what's in seasons and what meals to eat during that season, than a Pagan!<br />Examples of some of the delicious dishes you too can enjoy from this book are: Curried Stuffed Eggs, Golden Potato Soup, Roasted Vegetable Lasagna, Summer Garden Couscous, Southwestern Polenta and Garden Gazpacho.<br />This cookbook was so good, that I also recommend another one of her cookbooks \\"Cooking by Moonlight, 13 Menus for 13 Moons\\".<br />Check out this book today!	2003-07-18

Not only does she define culinary terms used in cookbooks, but she also translates foreign terms, like flamb&eacute;, and describes fruits and vegetables!<br />I, originally, heard about this book at Amazon.com, and then later learned that Emeril Lagasse (celebrity chef) recommended this book. In fact, I just used the book when my mother-in-law was in town. We were ordering Chinese food and we wondered what the difference was between chow mien noodles and lo mien noodles...and it's in there!<br />There is a section in the back that helps you choose herbs and spices to go with certain foods, where to get more information about certain foods, oven temperatures, conversions from metric to imperial, what some common additives found in your food are, food conversions (1 apple = 1/3 pound), common British and American terminologies as well as meat charts (so you can see what cuts of meat come from which part of the animal)!<br />I definitely recommend this book to everyone, whether you are a great cook or just starting out. This book has everything you need to know!	2002-05-16

I recently purchased this great idea! It's a cookbook, along with a CD! It's called &quot;Afternoon Tea Serenade&quot; by Sharon O'Connor. The author is a musician, and author, as well as a cook. Afternoon Tea Serenade is her 12th release!<br />The book contained within this set is great! I enjoy books that not only offer you the recipes, but also offer you history and techniques. This book tells you not only the origination of tea (the drink, that is), but also the custom of &quot;afternoon tea&quot;. There are tips on how to choose tea, how to brew the perfect cup of tea, how to make iced tea, as well as how to make some herbal teas! She suggests how to pick suitable tea cups, and offers some suggestions as to how to throw a themed tea party, such as a Bridal Shower Tea.<br />The book is filled with recipes from famous tea houses in the United States, England and Ireland. Such recipes include Welsh Rarebit, Cucumber and Mint Sandwiches, as well as Barmbrack. I have tried quite a few of the recipes and they each have turned out wonderfully.<br />Included within this set is a CD, which contains classical music to set the atmosphere. When I listened to this CD, I felt like I was back in the late 1800s during Victorian times! Artists on this CD include Bach and Mozart. Each piece is wonderful, and I am sure you will recognizea few, if not all of the pieces!<br />Treat yourself, or a friend, to something special this Spring, and buy this set! Then, call over your family and friends and have yourself a tea party!	2002-05-16

I am not a vegetarian, but the giver of the gift knew I like to try and eat healthy meals.<br />When I first looked at the cookbook, I thought that these were far too glamorous of meals for me.  So, I put it with the rest of my cookbooks.  Then, one day, I really looked at it.  These recipes were so simple, I could not figure out why I had not even bothered to try a recipe.  Then, I actually put a recipe to the test.  The Australian Apple-Chocolate Cake was DIVINE!  It had no flour and no added fat, yet it was so rich and tasty I could not believe it!  I tried others and was equally impressed.<br />Grab yourself a copy of this book before it is too late!  It is a must have!	2001-12-14

Shirley O. Corriher is a food scientist.  She explains the chemical reactions that happen between certain ingredients.  For example, if you are making a fresh mayonnaise (oil, eggs, lemon juice), she said that you must never use extra-virgin olive oil as this oil contains a chemical that prevents it from emulsifying with other ingredients.<br />In her book, she also includes over 230 recipes which help support this technique.<br />She is in high demand as chefs and cookbook authors are forever<br />consulting her on why their new recipes have failed.<br />I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand what is happening when they use a recipe.	2001-10-03

The first time I heard of Biker Billy was on a Sunday morning on our local PBS, my husband and I watched his show. Biker Billy was in a dark basement (I think) and he was cooking. It was so strange, as usually, on cooking shows, you see these culinary experts, dressed in their culinary clothes in a well lit kitchen and cameras everywhere. This was totally the opposite. Biker Billy was wearing his trademark Biker Billy black T-shirt and dark sunglasses.<br />I was so surprised to find out that Biker Billy actually had a cookbook out. I bought it, when I was pregnant, more as a novelty, but opened it up and saw a very interesting person in Biker Billy.<br />His cookbook is vegetarian. So, if you are looking for meat, it's not here. Also, which I knew from the TV show, he uses a lot of hot peppers. AND, as his name implies, he loves to ride motorcycles.<br />I sampled a few of the recipes and definitely fell in love with this cookbook. My favorites are: &quot;Kiss of the Devil Cocoa&quot;, &quot;Hot Garbanzo Bean Patties&quot; (AKA Falafel) and &quot;Hot Hummus&quot;.<br />A great thing about this book is that he explains the peppers he is using, and how hot they are. He also lists some resources where you can purchase these peppers.<br />Another thing, he even talks about motorcycle safety, as motorcycle riding is one of his favorite past-times.<br />If you keep your eye open, you can even see him on other shows. I saw him once on Next Door With Katie Brown (it used to be on Lifetime TV). It was hysterical to see them together. She is so wide-eyed midwestern, cute and innocent, and here is Biker Billy tossing in all these peppers and she is looking shocked, but pleasantly!<br />Would I recommend this book? Sure! It's a great book!	2001-06-07

Here is an wonderful book that shows what an excellent Southwestern-style chef he is.<br />This book contains explanations to some of his ingredients, as well as techniques to use, when using an ingredient, for example, using yellow tomatoes versus red tomatoes. He, also, adds resources where you can find some of his hard-to-find ingredients. This is a definite plus, as a lot of the chiles are hard-to-find in my area, but so worth the effort, because once you assemble the recipe, it is SO delicious! You just can't believe it.<br />I tried a few of these recipes on my husband, who has a distinct taste that is hard to please, to say the least, and he has loved each recipe I have made from this book. Favorites of ours are the Pan Seared New York Steak with Chipotle Butter, Caesar Salad with Red Chile Croutons and the Peach &amp; Blueberry Cobbler!<br />In addition to writing cookbooks, Bobby Flay hosts three television shows on the Food Network: &quot;Food Nation with Bobby Flay&quot;, &quot;Hot Off the Grill with Bobby Flay&quot; and &quot;Grillin' and Chillin'&quot;.<br />&quot;Food Nation&quot; is a tour of the United States in the least likely spots, where Bobby Flay explores the cuisine of that area. Spots visited have been the Pennsylvania Dutch country, Kentucky, Nashville and Boston.<br />&quot;Hot Off the Grill&quot; shows Bobby Flay assemble meals with some volunteers that may be like the more average at-home cook, showing me, how easy these dishes really are to prepare.<br />&quot;Grillin' and Chillin'&quot; has only been on during barbecue season (that I have noticed), but shows Bobby Flay with Jack McDavid, a real southern cook. Together they barbecue huge spreads all on the grill!<br />Bobby Flay also has his own line of spice and condiments. A wide assortment from dry rubs, drink mixes, infused oils and spice blends. These are available to purchase at his &quot;Mesa Grill&quot; web site: [...]<br />Also, he owns and works at two restaurants in New York City: &quot;Mesa Grill&quot; (Southwestern cuisine) and &quot;Bolo&quot; (Contemporary Spanish cuisine).<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this cookbook and would highly recommend it!wns and works at two restaurants in New York City: &quot;Mesa Grill&quot; (Southwestern cuisine) and &quot;Bolo&quot; (Contemporary Spanish cuisine). <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this cookbook and would highly recommend it!	2001-06-07

I had never heard of the author before, but began to read the cookbook as a book.  I was most impressed by the contents.<br />Each recipe gives us a short story to where the recipe originated...location in France, and the family that makes it.<br />I enjoyed the cookbook immensely as the author lives in France, yet is American, so she can explain how to replace those ingredients that we don't have here in the United States.<br />Later, I began cooking from the book.  Let me tell you, I was getting raving reviews from my fellow co-workers and since, the baby group I joined.<br />I would recommned this book.  Her recipes are easy to read and not complicated at all.  Plus, it gives you the feeling that you are somewhere else...far away from your cares...to a more simpler time...the French Countryside!	2001-04-21

This book is filled with delicious, easy to prepare healthy meals.  I am not a vegetarian, but do have a few vegetarian cookbooks.  My other books contain recipes with hard-to-find ingredients, which makes it difficult to try something new!  This book, unlike those, had ingredients available at my local grocery store, fast, flavorful meals and in an easy to read format.<br />This book is also divided into seasons, which I find to be VERY nice.  Once, I had gone to an herbalist in Chinese medicine, and the doctor there told me that I was eating the wrong foods.  I was confused, as I was eating salads!  How unhealthy is that?  She explained, because it was winter, I should have been eating warming foods; foods that are harvested in the wintertime, such as oranges, soups etc.  I was really quite surprised, yet it made sense.<br />Later, I took an herbal healing class.  In that class, the instructor stated that in a region where there is poison oak, for example, there is another herb capable of healing a poison oak reaction.  I thought about that for a while, and fused these two ideas of thinking.<br />We are provided with foods that are nourishing to us in the appropriate season to where we live.  That does not mean you can never eat pineapples in the north, but that you should take advantage of the bounty available to you while it is in season.<br />Karri Allrich presents this book in an effortless fashion, with little excerpts to go with each recipe, as well as sample menus for appropriate Pagan holidays.  Her recipes are flavorful, and quick and easy to make.  I look forward to her future cookbook, &quot;Cooking by Moonlight, 13 Menus for 13 Moons&quot; due out in 2002.<br />Examples of her recipes include: Bruschetta, Huevos Rancheros, Bear Dreamer's Walnut Biscotti, Spicy Hummus, Roasted Winter Vegetables and May Wine.<br />I would highly recommend this book for your kitchen!	2001-03-19
