Alex was born weighing only 23 ounces and spent one year in Neonatal Intensive Care in the hospital. As you might expect his time in the hospital was rocky, a wild ride on the often frightening preemie roller coaster. Once he came home from the hospital he still needed oxygen and feeding assistance for several years. Even as he began to get stronger, concerns were raised over developmental issues as he moved through preschool.  <br /> <br />Jeff Stimpson skillfully describes in intimate and accurate detail the emotional and practical impact of raising a very small preemie. The ups and downs, the joys and grief, the worries and just pure frustrations are beautifully elaborated. For most people who face this reality, life is an exhausting and apparently never ending blur, filled with emotional highs and lows. Jeff shows that parents can not only survive this journey, but maintain their hopes and sense of humor. His love for his son shines through on every page.	2005-02-22

Its primary focus is on parenting your baby in the NICU, and its filled with advice on how to handle your baby, ways to provide comfort and more protection and assistance in interacting with professionals in the NICU. Overall it is a comforting book which introduces you to the astonishing world of neonatal intensive care.<br /><br />The title is really a bit of a misnomer, as what the book does best is provide information for the new parent, especially one whose baby is doing relatively well and is not extremely premature. For someone whose situation is more fragile, I would recommend this be supplemented by one of the more extensive books in our recommendations on prematurity.org. However, there is a broad audience for this book, as most preemies will do well in the NICU and after; for those parents this is a gentle and supportive introduction.	2005-02-13

The last third of the book presents various treatment options - descriptions and strengths and weaknesses.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.

Ann Leary flew to London for what she thought would be a short vacation, when she unexpectedly delivered her baby prematurely. She uses humor and story telling skills to recount her subsequent five month stay in England, as her baby is born and then slowly grows. This book is a bit lighter than many books on prematurity, focusing on her fish out of water feelings as she copes with living on low funds in an unfamiliar environment. The author is frank and open about her struggles with the complications of having a preemie, in the special care unit and then in her apartment. This is a book that anyone can enjoy, as well as parents of preemies.	2005-01-29

One word I would personally use to describe his work is lyrical, and yet another word would be stark. In fact he evokes a contradictory experience, which defies characterization. The stories seem simple, often depressing, and yet they have a grace and underlying imagery that is captivating.  <br /> <br />A recurring theme explores the inadequacy of heroes and traditional beliefs. However, much of the imagery, surroundings, and events are steeped in Buddhist and Vietnamese moral philosophy and Vietnamese myth and history. In many ways, this juxtaposition of aware struggle and darkly humorous acceptance seems to be a quintessential feature of Vietnamese culture. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in literature or who wishes a glimpse inside modern Vietnamese imagery.	2005-01-28

This book came about as a consequence of Dr. Foli's difficulty in bonding with her baby daughter early in her adoption. As a couple, Dr. Foli and Dr. Thompson used this as a starting point to highlight many of the emotional aspects of adoption with which parents might struggle. Their belief is that by identifying and accepting difficult emotions and circumstances, parents can work through them to achieve feelings of love and acceptance.  <br /> <br />This book will be useful to a parent (or perspective parent) who finds themselves struggling with feelings of sadness, frustration or anger. It will affirm that these are feelings that others have felt and offers suggestions for coping with these emotions.  <br />It is likely that parts of the book will be more pertinent than others, depending upon your circumstances and personality as so many issues are addressed.  Nonetheless, the approach of bringing a host of issues to the discussion table is commendable and results in a valuable resource.	2005-01-08

Most of the book is about her adoption and journey home, with the joy that this brings to her family.

In the early 1900's the last surviving member of the Yahi tribe walked out of the woods into a town in California. All the other members of his tribe had either been killed or died, he was the only one left speaking his language. Yashi, as he was called, was taken under the wings of a small anthropological museum where he alternately was treated as a human being and as a living exhibit. <br />In Only the Wind Remembers, Marlo Schalesky takes this rather sad and unusual history and creates a poignant and uplifting fictional story. She describes the loss of connection between well-meaning people when they feel forced to live their lives according to rather restrictive rules of the late 1900's. In the end they are brought to the realization that through Jesus' sacrifice, God provides a richness of forgiveness and acceptance that can be life changing.<br />Although the characters are ensnared in rather sad situations, this is a gentle and soothing account.  It is easy to become caught up with the stories of each individual and you will want to keep reading to find out what will happen to them. The image of the Ishi playing songs on his flute in the museum that no one else in the world will ever hear again is one that will linger with you a long time after the book is over.	2004-03-04

Crucial topics are covered which are rarely addressed adequately, but are vital to children with special needs - for example, feeding, visual impairment, teeth and dental care. <br />As moderator of mailing lists on Adoption (from Vietnam) and Prematurity, it is rare that I can recommend a book for both groups, but this is one that meets the needs of many parents.<br />When Your Child Has a Disability covers four major areas - Getting the Diagnosis, Growing Up with a Disability, Developmental Disabilities, and a brief section called What the Future Holds. Each chapter in these sections is authored by an experienced practitioner in the field. They provide an concise overview for each subject, an explanation of the terminology, and a number of practical suggestions for your child. <br />The section on Growing Up with a Disability covers topics vital to parents of children with special needs, such as nutrition and feeding, dental care, and encouraging appropriate behavior. Specific disabilities are covered in the Developmental Disability section, including many disabilities linked to prematurity. Twelve developmental disabilities are addressed - cerebral palsy, hearing loss, autism, mental retardation, visual impairment, communication disorders, learning disorders, down syndrome, genetic syndromes, spina bifida, and epilepsy.<br />For parents of children who have special needs (or are &quot;at risk&quot; for developmental disabilities), When Your Child Has a Disability is invaluable. .
