Babbitt was a moderately successful, reasonably honest real estate man in the mythical midwestern American industrial city of Zenith. Product himself of a virtuous small town, Catawba, Babbitt rose to become a college graduate, married man and father of three. He was a joiner (Elks, Boosters), political activist (Republican precinct leader), churchman (Presbyterian) and believer in the power and beauty of advertising. Over the next year or so, George or \\"Georgie\\" became favorably noticed  by his betters through previously muted oratorical and advocacy skills. But as he rose in public and kingmakers' esteem, he also stumbled by admitting weakly to a certain sympathy (but not solidarity) with labor unions, strikers and a radical local lawyer, college friend Seneca Doane. <br /> <br />When another and much closer friend went to prison for a crime of personal violence, Babbitt lost his bearings. Zenith, its mores and values,  no longer defined for Babbitt the outer imaginable limits of human striving. Yet he could not create anything better. All he could rouse himself to do was to experiment with a couple of amours, run around for a few weeks with a fast crowd, drink too much, hurt his wife's feelings, slip out of the office to go to movies   and slide into mild disrepute with his business peers and his betters. <br /> <br />In the end, however, Babbitt lost energy and all pretense to be a free wheeling libertine and slipped back to being Good Old Georgie. Once again he was predictable. That is, \\"he cheated only if it was sanctified by precedent\\" (Ch. 4). He championed with conviction \\"the spiritual and mental side of American supremacy ... spiritual and, uh, dominating movements like Efficiency, and Rotarianiam, and Prohibition, and Democracy\\" (Ch. 6). While transforming himself back to what American businessmen were intended to be, George F. Babbitt left posterity a  name synonymous with dull mediocrity, caution and conformity. <br /> <br />-OOO- <br />	2005-09-14

After the Civil War its social equilibrium was provided by an older aristocracy of stern Puritan immigrants from New England: four men of respected professions, \\"medicine, law, religion, and finance.\\" But by 1910 or thereabouts, the Gopher Prairie of Sinciair Lewis's 1920 novel MAIN STREET (and the surrounding countryside which ithe town was meant to serve) had become an ethnic melting pot and mere merchants and land speculators were growing rich and challenging old standards of social respectability. <br /> <br />Lewis's MAIN STREET is about a newly volatile mix of small-town people groping toward a constructive social equilibrium for Gopher Prairie. Their search is best illustrated in four characters: Carol Milford Kennicott, her schoolteacher friend and critic Vida Sherwin Wutherspoon, Carol's husband Dr Will Kennicott and his best friend and social inferior, merchant Sam Clark. <br /> <br />Melting-pot Gopher Prairie is severely challenged by its latest arrival, idealistic, impatient, impractical Carol Kennicott (nee Milford). All its \\"denizens\\" (Carol's word) seem called to resist her pretense to be an insistent sun of the Minnesota prairies cultural solar system. She wills Gopher Prairie to become as beautiful and refined as Mankato, Minnesota where she grew up. She exhorts individuals and organizations to achieve her vision of an Athens of the Prairies. Carol puts on a play. She befriends social misfits. She by turns enchants and baffles her steady, plodding husband, Will Kennicott, M.D. She imagines her town infected by a Village Virus which spreads mediocrity. Slowly, however, impulsive, idealistic Carol accepts the importance of timing in the art of reform and is tamed downward to a feasible level of action. Vida Sherwin proves the wisdom of settling for just one new school if and when transformation of the entire town becomes too much. Gopher Prairie is thus made hospitable to both a wiser, priority-setting Carol and to Vida, as once long ago Biblical Bethany had worked for Jesus's friends, the very different sisters Mary and Martha. <br /> <br />Venerable survivors of Gopher Prairie's old New England transplanted aristocracy accept the professional credentials of Will Kennicott and the town's other doctors. But they remain conditioned to regard Will's best friend Sam Clark and other merchants as undignified social upstarts. Why does Dr Kennicott hunt ducks and play bridge with the likes of Clark, self-described \\"dealer in hardware, sporting goods, cream separators and almost every kind of heavy junk you can think of\\" (Ch. III)? And why does Kennicott decline to go lower socially? Why, for instance, shoot ducks with his tailor, but not with his barber? <br /> <br />Will Kennicott is a good-hearted, tunnel-visioned, work absorbed \\"plugger.\\" Will and Sam are as close as David and Jonathan. It is Sam who drives the newly weds from the train station to their home in his pre World War One automobile. Sam Clark and his wife are the first denizens to entertain the Kennicotts at home. Indeed, the unimpressive Clark house is ever before Dr Kennicott's imagination as the model for his own future dream home. Carol resents tobacco-spitting Sam and other poker-playing friends of Will and perhaps subconsciously blames Sam for making her professional-level husband feel comfortable bathing only once a week, shaving thrice, not shining his shoes and letting his clothes become rumpled. Neither Sam nor Will is a big reader, though they admire one-time St Paul librarian Carol for her bibliophilia.  <br /> <br />Towards novel's end Carol has made it clear to her husband that: \\"You have a right to me if you can keep me. Can you?\\" (Ch. XXXVI). Will then makes a quiet effort to improve himself and wins her back. For his part, faithful Sam keeps on accepting his friend's judgmental, demanding wife. A new equilibrium is created in Gopher Prairie. But Carol Kennicott foresees for her baby daughter a new world as far into the future as the year 2000. \\"She may see aeroplanes going to Mars.\\" She will meanwhile be \\"a bomb to blow up smugness\\" (Ch. XXXIX). But for the moment the \\"Tories\\" of Gopher Prairie settle gratefully for a calmer Carol and resume straightening their collars, hanging their storm-windows and looking for misplaced screwdrivers. <br /> <br />-OOO- <br /> <br />	2005-09-08

Murphy. It is must reading if you want immersion in    --New Orleans, rich in Catholic education and a thriving theater life, where Father Murphy's first church, Saint Joan of Arc, sat at the foot of a levee (and in September 2005 may be underwater in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina) (Ch. VIII);    --interactions with boyhood friend, actor and playwright Eddie Dowling as well as graduate school friend (later Bishop) Fulton J. Sheen, and the chance discovery of a young singer, Kate Smith;    --history of the Josephite Congregation of priests, brothers and nuns, founded by the future Cardinal Vaughn of England to minister to Negroes in America;    --the ways and methods of a priest who was playwright and novelist long before today's Father Andrew Greeley.    I read the book primarily because Sinclair Lewis's definitive biographer Mark Schorer recommends it for some unique insights into the author of MAIN STREET, BABBITT and ELMER GANTRY. Father Murphy met Sinclair Lewis in 1940 because his friend Eddie Dowling had given him amateur acting rights to Irish playwright Paul Vincent Carroll's SHADOW AND SUBSTANCE and Lewis came to New Orleans to play the lead role of Canon Skerritt.  Murphy (XI, 241) had to overcome earlier prejudices against an allegedly fierce foe of religion but their friendship endured until Lewis's lonely death in Rome in 1951. By then Murphy had read all of Lewis's novels and some short stories.     Lewis told Father Murphy that he had set sail for Europe just after MAIN STREET first appeared and plenty of copies were being read on deck. Suddenly one woman \\"sprang up from her chair, leapt to the ship railing and hurled MAIN STREET with all her might into the sea\\" (p. 242)--a most honest review.  Murphy liked Lewis at once and found the earlier God-challenging rhetoric associated mainly with his days researching and writing ELMER GANTRY very possibly \\"a perverse form of God-seeking.\\" Lewis's intense concentration on rehearsing for and performing his role of Canon Skerritt reminded of similar strength in saintly Mother Katherine Drexel. Father Murphy saw in Sinclair Lewis a potential saint riding a tortured road to Damascus.     Father J. Fulton Sheen had recently converted newspaper columnist Heywood Broun to Catholicism. So one night during rehearsals Murphy said to Sinclair Lewis, \\"Why don't you do a 'Heywood Broun'? To which Lewis replied, \\"Why don't you do an 'Elmer Gantry'?\\" Curiously, during rehearsals for his role as an Irish Catholic priest, Sinclair Lewis could never make the Sign of the Cross correctly. Finally, during  the second act of a performance solely for nuns (who adored the play and Lewis) he got it right. This recollection of this event was so strong that on the last page (315) of YANKEE PRIEST, while outside a prison where a converted Negro murderer whom the priest came to know had  made a saintly death, Edward Murphy wrote \\"I touch my finger to the forehead, chest, and shoulders. The gesture that Sinclair Lewis once found so difficult, the Sign of the Cross.\\"    This book should be republished and marketed. It can  be read for many things, including the early history two Negro universities in New Orleans, Xavier and Drexel and especially the author's involvement in the early, glory years of Xavier (where Murphy was chaplain and professor): notably its theater, musicals and even football.    -OOO-	2005-09-01

For forty of their sixty years Seth and Sarah Jane Appleby have been married and living in New York City. They raised one daughter who married a successful pharmacist and produced a male heir. Seth brings home the bacon from his job as something more than a clerk and salesman at a shoe store. Sarah Jane makes a happy home. The balance of their power does begin to shift one summer when Seth, not without a certain economic sense, decides to break out of his metropolitan rut and open a Tea Shop on rural Cape Cod where the couple has long spent its two week vacations. They bring to this project equally weak skills in selecting china and chairs and in the end lose their shirts in less than five months.<br /><br />After further setbacks, they begin a wandering life together. Through New Jersey they tramp. Then at a hobo camp in West Virginia, Seth's star begins to rise. Sarah Jane indeed makes friends of the villainous looking hoboes, cooks their food, mends their clothes and brings about a reformation of manners and morals. But one of the tramps sees some potential for bigger things in Seth and coaches him in physical fitness,  little tricks of body language and rhetoric which propel him into a leader's self-confidence. He and she return to the open road with the confidence of  Christian apostles after Pentecost. Seth almost overawes his loyal wife with his developing talents but their mutual affection allows the couple to create a new, mutually satisfying equilibrium.<br /><br />Call it flight. Call it travel. Call it greener grass across the road. But one persistent theme in both Sinclair Lewis's personal life and in his novels is that sheer movement, sheer trying out something completely new and different, simply hitting the trail -- all or some of these -- will almost surely bring good results, something better. \\"It's always easier to be a bold adventurer in some town other than the one in which you are\\" (Ch. XIII). Seth to Sarah Jane: \\"Let's see. New York doesn't want us. But somewhere there must be a village of folks that does. .. Come on, we'll start for Japan, and see the cherry-blossoms. Come on, old partner, we're going to pioneer, like our daddies that went West\\" (Ch. XII).<br /><br />Finally, Chapter XVII has a paean to small town living that could have been written by Paul Harris, who tried in 1905, via establishing the world's first Rotary Club,  to re-create in cutthroat, impersonal Chicago the virtues and general chumminess of the Wallingford, Vermont  village (population 1,000) where he grew up. It is hard to imagine the same Sinclair Lewis writing so glowingly of village life in 1917 when he would show its unlovely side only three years later in MAIN STREET. And yet, there it is: \\"In a village, every clerk, every tradesman, has something of the same distinctive importance as the doctors, the lawyers, the ministers. ... \\"in Lippittsville Mr. Seth Appleby was not just a lowly person who helped one in the choice of shoes. He was a person, he was their brother, to be loved or hated.\\" The indiscriminate calling of everyone by first name that Lewis would condemn a decade later in ELMER GANTRY's Zenith Rotary Club appears perfectly natural and amiable in the village of THE INNOCENTS.<br /><br />Sinclair Lewis never lost the ability to surprise, just as Babe Ruth, even aging, was always capable on any given day of hitting one out of the ball park.<br /><br />-OOO-	2005-08-18
US	53080931	R20DH8LV7CP64O	9997412370	820457278	Dodsworth	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A Novel That Sings Like Middle American Opera	Sinclair Lewis's 1929 novel DODSWORTH has staying power. It remains widely read. It was made into a Broadway stage play and then a 1936 motion picture nominated for seven Academy Awards. Imagine Giancarlo Menotti or Leonard Bernstein turning DODSWORTH into an opera of Midwestern passion and rhetoric! Published the year before its author became America's first winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, DODSWORTH repeats and intensifies a number of themes, at least one  visible as early as 1912's HIKE AND THE AEROPLANE. <br /> <br />--The hero, automobile pioneer Samuel Dodsworth, wonders whether there a  dimension to corporate life beyond sheer hard work and sticking to what one knows best. If so what is it? Travel? Leisure? The life of the mind? Good conversation? An absorbing hobby? A wife supportive of both his business and non-business quests? <br /> <br />--Is travel in the sense of sheer moving from here to there, from one place to another, out roughing it on the long trail, the ultimate solution? Must man move incessantly in order to be happy? In New York City, after some months in a more relaxed, contemplative Europe, Dodsworth saw Manhattan as \\"veritably the temple of a new divinity, the God of Speed.\\" That God of Speed \\"demanded a belief that Going Somewhere, Going Quickly, Going Often, were in themselves holy and greatly to be striven for. A demanding God, this Speed, ... who once he had been offered a hundred miles an hour, straightway demanded a hundred and fifty\\" (Ch. 16). <br /> <br />--Midwestern Americans, makers of national greatness, at their best are regularly accused by Sinclair Lewis of being ordinary, conformist, risk avoiders. Without their Babbitry, their service clubs, their lodges and their main-line churches,  American business leaders of the second magnitude are nothing, certainly not the legendary American pioneers of yesteryear! In some ways, Sam Dodsworth at 50 was therefore not a typical product of midwestern Zenith. He was \\"perfectly,the American Captain of Industry. ... (But) He was none of the things which most Europeans and many Americans expect in a leader of American industry. He was not a Babbitt, not a Rotarian, not an Elk, not a deacon. ... He knew, and thoroughly, the Babbitts and baseball fans, but only in business\\" (Ch.2). When Dodsworth opted for a few months of travel abroad before jumping back into the rat race, the man who bought out his company accused him of thinking that the purpose of life is loafing, whereas, \\"I tell you, Dodsworth, to me, work is a religion. ... Do big things\\" (Ch. 3). In London, even his wife Fran accused Dodworth (who had attended only one Rotary lunch in his life) of wanting to be \\"back in all the Rotarian joys of Zenith\\" (Ch. 11). Ross Ireland, a world traveler journalist told Dodsworth that one reason he loved America so passionately was that its \\"Elks and the Rotarians and the National Civic Federation are (not) any more grab-it-all than the English merchant\\" (Ch. 16). In discussing America's appeal to him with emerging lady friend Edith Cortwright, Sam Dodsworth ironically concluded that there are only two good reasons for American businessmen to travel abroad: to attend \\"a Rotary convention, or on a conducted tour where he's well insulated from furriners. Upsets him. Spoils his pleasure in his own greatness and knowledge!\\" (Ch. 31) <br /> <br />--Another recurring Sinclair Lewis riddle is the relation of husband to wife. Does a great American achiever really need a wife? If so, why? She dare not be his intellectual or entrepreneurial equal. She is permitted a few innocent distractions from running a household and raising children. Dancing and country clubbing are all right. Flirting with other men is frowned upon. And Dodsworth has absolutely no empathy for wife Fran as she frenetically reasserts her youth and her right not to be known as a grandmother. Above all, she has no right to carp at him, to put him in his place before his friends or hers. <br /> <br />DODSWORTH was written by Sinclair Lewis at the height of his powers. If Samuel Dodsworth is a brooding Prince Hamlet among American business leaders, he is a distinctly understated American Hamlet. Yes, Sam Dodsworth is more Socratic than a Babbitt or a Rotarian but less human than the troubled, seeking sinners of Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh. <br /> <br />-OOO-	2005-07-22

Sinclair Lewis was running low on creative juices. Yet there are scattered and surprisingly good nuggets, flashes of Lewis's old scorn of hypocrisy and greed along with a sad cameo farewell to an aging Reverend Doctor ELMER GANTRY, a rogue first seen in 1927. <br /> <br />The narrative framework:  <br /> <br />Gideon Planish, born a midwesterner in 1892 and reared evangelically, by age ten sensed that his gift of gab would take him far. He might become a governor or a senator. He would in any case hold large audiences rapt. But as an adult man of modest talents, Sinclair Lewis's Gid Planish sometimes rose and sometimes fell, lurching generally upwards in an occasionally ruthless career that touched academia, advertising and management of philanthropic organizations. As his physical vigor and belief in what he was doing slowly left him, his much younger wife Peony swelled from docile supporter of his great work and frivolous spender of his income into a powerhouse with developed skills networking among wives and daughters of the rich and famous.  <br /> <br />Gideon Planish's minutely busy weekend before and during the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 is laid out in  detail. He was suddenly offered the presidency of Kinnikinick College in Iowa. There he had been dean and Peony one of his students. He realized  wistfully that this was his last chance to redeem his soul from the hypocrisy of American big city philanthropy management. But Peony effectively brushed all this off by saying that they would live on in New York where she would protect his income-providing career through her network of influential wives of the giants of philanthropy. Their daughter Carrie went to work in a defense factory. Gideon Planish weakly accepted being sentenced to  modern mediocrity. End of plot. <br /> <br />This is clearly not a great yarn. The grinding mediocrity of virtually every character numbs attention. Even several pages re-introducing 1927's energetic rascal, the Reverend Elmer Gantry, portray a running down celebrity whose ideas have not grown and whose energies now produce little worth remembering. <br /> <br />As soon as he, Peony and Carrie came to New York, Dr Planish's work brought him into the religious-philanthropic ambience of Gantry. That divine, after his flaming escapades in the Midwest, now dominated a pulpit in Manhattan and also had a daily radio program called (what else?)  \\"Love Is the Morning Star.\\" Thanks to the program's chewing gum sponsor, Elmer's voice reached a million or more hearers, \\"particularly shut-ins.\\" He was rumored (falsely) to have studied at Harvard and in Germany but remained popular because \\"folksy\\" (Ch.19). From his base as pastor of the Spiritual Home Methodist Tabernacle on Morningside Heights, Gantry moved from strength to strength as radio pastor. His on-the-air sermons powerfully mixed \\"modern slang and long hard words.\\" God, he argued to youth, was to be found as readily in the automobile as He had once been in the hay-ride. Gantry had no peer as \\"living exponent of a streamlined gospel.\\" <br /> <br />Elmer Gantry was also a director of \\"the newest educational racket in town,\\" The Modernistic Educational Bureau. Its staff both composed (by plagiarizing) and then sold encyclopedias. Planish attended a seminal luncheon for money-raisers at which Dr. Gantry was \\"torridly\\" present as directive secretary of the Society for the Rehabilitation of Erring Young Women\\" (Ch. 25). Elmer and Gideon offhandedly formed a profitable partnership to design, manufacture and sell buttons advertising a political awareness organization of which both were directors, Dynamos of Democratic Direction -- DDD) (Ch. 28). <br /> <br />On Sunday December 7, 1941, not knowing that the Japanese were to bomb Pearl Harbor later that day, Gideon and Peony  attended Dr Elmer Gantry's morning services. The sermon proved that Europe was at war because God was displeased that in too many places, including Morningside Heights, people \\"did not go to church more regularly.\\" Peony Planish was not, however, edified to see Gantry's cute young female secretary on display in the front row of pews (Ch. 29). And so the fire-breathing, drinking, womanizing rogue of yesteryear had grown into aging respectability and repetitive dullness.  <br /> <br />More broadly, GIDEON PLANISH is about American philanthropy and its  money-raising feeding on big business. There are occasional salllies of insight and satire into that milieu. <br /> <br />By taking over the nascent \\"Every Man a Priest Foundation,\\" a bullying Gid made his first conquest in New York, and began \\"a career in holiness\\" by stealing both the vision of a saintly man [\\"Carlyle Vesper was as simple as Cardinal Newman\\"] (Ch 23), as well as his job and his list of rich backers. In New York Planish moved into circles of pretentious frauds including that Reverend ELMER GANTRY whom SInclair Lewis had introduced in 1927.  <br /> <br />Gideon Planish learned that the purpose of fund-raising was to inculcate in rich (or poor) sinners the habit of giving and keeping on giving, in order  \\"to expand their own miserable, narrow peanut souls\\" -- not to use the money for anything specific or philanthropic. The USA entered WW II and Planish's political patrons saw this as a \\"war of slogans.\\" Planish was directed to promote his masters in terms of their coming contributions to post-war peace, with an eye towards the Presidency. But neither must he forget that war is good for business! (Ch. 29). Suddenly, alas, for philanthropy, money flowed away from charity and good works towards war bonds. <br /> <br />Clearly enough Gideon weakly modeled aspects of himself on Elmer Gantry. But, more seminally, in 1925 Bruce Barton's booster life of Jesus, THE MAN NOBODY KNOWS, transformed Dr Planish. Never mind that Jesus was humanized downward as \\"a society gent, a real sport, a press agent and the founder of modern business.\\"  Lewis skewered THE MAN NOBODY KNOWS as the \\"Epistle to the Babbitts\\" (Ch. 14). It inspired Planish to create a witty column called \\"Corn-pone and Popcorn\\" and its most famous essay, on \\"Mental Elbow Grease.\\"  <br /> <br />There are one or two other flashes of insight into American Protestant behavior. Towards the end of Ch. 17 Sinclair Lewis humorously wrapped the newly rapturous Gideon Planish inside the mission and suffering of the Apostle Paul as laid out in II Corinthians 11:23-30. Lewis knew his scripture well enough to transfer its language, as did his fictitious character Reverend Elmer Gantry and the real Bruce Barton. The passage is about Gideon Planish: <br /> <br />\\"He saw himself dedicated now to the new life of service; in labors more abundant, in conferences above measure, on committees more frequent, in journeyings often, in long-distance telephoning often, in hunger and thirst at unpalatable public dinners, in cold audiences and nakedness of meaning -- and he was not afraid, and gloried of the things that concerned his infirmities.\\" <br /> <br />Another Pauline role model was William T. Knife, lay member of the Antinomian Church, referred to in ecclesiastical circles as \\"the humble millionaire who has applied the principles of of St. Paul to his private life and to the soft-drink business\\" (Ch. 21). Planish ghostwrote Knife's autobiography. This relationship led to wider personal contacts which facilitated Planish's natural transition from philanthropy to politics (i.e., by boosting others for President). For in the early 1930 big business feared revolution (especially by independent labor unions whose members were therefore exhorted to join churches instead) and therefore supported any philanthropy or politician promising to keep the lid on. But by 1940 times were changing and Gideon was convinced that there would soon be more money in anti-fascism than the current fascism of his masters.(Ch. 22) <br /> <br />Not consistently humorous, GIDEON PLANISH holds a mirror to American philanthropy and what self-seeking charlatans once did to it. <br /> <br />-OOO-	2005-07-16

Admittedly, it is \\"only\\" a boys' adventure tale. But who says that stories of the Hardy Boys or Frank Merriwell at Yale must totally lack literary merit? Any father or grandfather who has spun yarns knows the youthful market for stories in which his son or grandson is the hero of adventures with characters named \\"Confidential Wolf,\\" or about \\"When Jason first grew wings\\" or \\"How Maria's dolly stopped a bank robbery.\\" They are spontaneous and they can be spun out indefinitely. <br /> <br />Is HIKE AND THE AEROPLANE just another shaggy dog story? Yes, in a way. But one told by Sinclair Lewis, a future master. The novel is about two 16 year old California military boarding school boys and their chance encounter with an inventor of a working tetrahedral airplane that can fly 200 miles per hour with a 230 horsepower engine (an idea explored earlier by Alexander Graham Bell). The boys, Gerald (\\"Hike\\") Griffin and his lovable overweight sidekick Torrington (\\"Poodle\\") Darby, help the inventor land a million dollar contract with the U.S. Army Signal Corps to purchase his amazing flying machine. Along the way they save people from drowning on a yacht run aground and thwart a corrupt army captain and his private sector manufacturing partner in crime. Hike (shades of the future BIlly Mitchell) imagines the day when his tetrahedral plane will sink a battleship. The boys also help a wealthy and virtuous U.S. army lieutenant save his ranch in Mexico from rebels led by the disgraced evil captain. This they do with the ever reliable tetrahedral aeroplane called \\"Hustle,\\" a portable machine gun and a squad of Mexican federales. At the end of the story, Hike, a sophomore  left half-back playing in the big Thanksgiving Day football game against San Dinero, has broken into the clear. But,  he denies himself for the sake of the team and laterals the game winning football to a personal rival. He is then elected sophomore class president. <br /> <br />The story is a good-hearted, undemanding hoot, a fairy tale and morality tale. It deserves to be reissued for today's youngsters to enjoy. <br /> <br />When I was ten years old I could not get enough of the 15 potboilers churned out by R. Sidney Bowen beginning in 1941 with DAVE DAWSON AT DUNKIRK and continuing with DAVE DAWSON WITH THE R.A.F. Teenage American Dave had a faithful young English sidekick named Freddy Farmer. Just like Hike and Poodle. Boys who read books love adventure stories with young heroes. <br /> <br />What else is there to like about HIKE AND THE AEROPLANE? California ways of talking and behaving. <br /> <br />Before the Valley Girls of California and their \\"valley talk\\" there were already speech and behavior peculiar to California. Sinclair Lewis tells us that the novel's hero Gerald Griffin won his nickname \\"Hike\\" in a football game when he \\"hiked\\" his way to a touchdown, meaning he made a very long run down the field. We also learn that it was rude of other sophomore boys to break in on Poodle Darby's private cabin when he was writing verse. For Poodle was \\"sporting his oak,\\" as dons did at Oxford University when they closed the heavy oaken outer doors of their room while tutoring to show that they did not wish to be disturbed. We are also informed that Californians regularly used gold coins rather than paper bills, which Poodle did even around Washington, D.C.  And California boarding schools were more likely to produce teams for rugby than for football. I used to think that pausing dramatically and then adding ... \\"not\\" at the end of the sentence was a linguistic coinage even more recent than valley talk. For instance, \\"She is so charming ... NOT!\\" Well in 1912 one vicious kidnapper said to his captive (Hike), \\"Now I guess you'll run tetrahedrals -- not, young smart Aleck\\" (Ch. XII) And the abundant schoolboy slang of the novel has to be read aloud to be savored. <br /> <br />On a profounder level, there are lyric passages by soldiers, American and Mexican alike, as well as by young Hike himself, lamenting human nature's all too easy turning to violence and sketching a vision of a future U.S. Army too busy building great engineering works for the good of mankind to plan for wars of aggression.  <br /> <br />Finally, this yarn is about the early history of aviation. It makes you want to know more of the rivalry between Alexander Graham Bell and the Wright Brothers. You learn how inventors built kites as a stage toward engine-powered flight. You see flying and football as akin. <br /> <br />Only three years after HIKE AND THE AEROPLANE Sinclair Lewis returned in fiction to the theme of aviation in THE TRAIL OF THE HAWK (1915). Lewis knew aviation and loved it. <br /> <br />-OOO- <br />	2005-07-08

WORK OF ART (1934) might be subtitled \\"Hotel Management for Dummies.\\" Even IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE (1935) lays out the \\"how to\\" mechanics of a Fascist takeover of these United States. Sinclair Lewis had in one way or another immersed himself in these topics for a time, usually not many months before he wrote about them. Prior to BETHEL MERRIDAY he had written plays, acted in plays and would also direct them.<br /><br />Not all of Lewis's novels by any means are of this \\"how to\\" ilk. But 1940's BETHEL MERRIDAY most certainly is. It might be styled \\"All About the Stage for Dummies.\\" The heroine, Bethel Merriday, was born June 1, 1916. On her sixth birthday her mother caught her imitating the slouching, slow walk of an old woman and rebuked her for generally showing off, speaking up in Church and in this case for \\"copying\\" people. Bethel said, \\"Oh! I'm not copying her. I'm trying to be her. I can be a lot of different people.\\" Her mother's comment: \\"It all sounds like maybe you're going to be an actress.\\" (Ch. 1)<br /><br />At home in Sladesbury, Connecticut, Bethel learned something of acting from motion pictures. Without ever having seen professional actors in the flesh, she grew ever more sure that she would be an actress and she shared this vision with her skeptical young friends. And she would be  a professional stage actress, not an amateur. \\"I'm not going to play at playing. No! It isn't good enough!\\" (Ch. 1) Finally, in the summer of 1931 a touring troupe came to Sladesbury. 15-year old Bethel rapturously took in their performances, waited for actors and actresses at the stage door and even followed them to a drugstore where they had a bite. She drank in their shop talk. She spoke to a young actress. An older actor told Bethel that if she wanted to become an actress, she must train, play parts at every opportunity and get lucky (Ch. 1)<br /><br />Bethel went on to act in college and to be noticed in her senior year somewhat negatively by two professional directors. Her father paid for her to apprentice in summer stock on the Connecticut shore in the summer of 1938. In the autumn of that year connections which she made in summer stock helped her quickly but very luckily become part of a brand new touring troupe which would do ROMEO AND JULIET in modern dress. Bethel understudied Juliet and played her once, when the $1,000/week English actress took to drink. Other speaking parts were small. But Bethel was interested in all aspects of theater: musicians, lighting and especially scenery design. She worked very hard and she learned quickly that on stage you \\"Never do anything unless you understand why.\\" (Ch. 11)<br /><br />Almost inevitably, the road show lost money and failed. This left 23 year old Bethel with time to choose among several men who offered her marriage, including her next door neighbor from home and two actors who had played Romeo and Mercutio on the road. She chose the talented  \\"Mercutio\\" and they were married Saturday January 21, in Pike City, Kansas, population 7,000, end of the line for the theater tour. A few months later the newlyweds were acting together in New York for another company whose director had seen Bethel overact Nora in Ibsen's DOLL HOUSE in college only seven months earlier.<br /><br />If you like novels about the theater, BETHEL MERRIDAY will call to mind Herman Wouk's 1955 MARJORIE MORNINGSTAR, without the latter's Angst. BETHEL MERRIDAY lacks the profundity of Goethe's 1796 WILHELM MEISTER. But all three books were written by menwho knew and loved theater and spoke with authority. Sinclair Lewis's theater novel woos the senses with cramped dressing rooms and the smell of grease paint, the look and feel of increasingly shabby costumes as the tour grows old and conveys a sense of what makes actors and actresses do what they do, usually for very little money. And the stage has its personnnel dimension, too. Young Bethel is even pressed by an embarrassed producer to tell an aging ham that he must go.<br /><br />Sinclair Lewis portrays theater as a partnership between actors and audience and argues that being a good audience is a skill to be learned. Language once used for religion is now applied to show business:  to actors on stage \\"each with his prides and secrets and sins,\\" (Ch. 12), to the audience as heathens to be \\"advanced toward salvation,\\" to faith in the power of staged illusions to change the world, to devout study of a role, to that limbo where all young actors and bull fighters float, and finally to \\"the solid American Protestant belief in the glory and efficacy of human will power. If anyone wanted enough to do anything, he would unquestionably do it...\\" (Ch. 18). The faces of most Americans today have been \\"ironed out by spiritual massage\\" (Ch. 33). Not so the face of a great actor.<br /><br />People who love theater will recognize one of their own in Sinclair Lewis.<br /><br />-OOO-ritten by men who knew and loved theater and spoke with authority.

In 1924 Sinclair Lewis and his physician brother Claude wangled an invitation from the Canadian government to take part in an annual Treaty Trip, i.e., visiting Cree, Chippewa and other Indian tribes to pay each member $5 to console them for having taken away their lands. Sinclair lasted only a month away from his booze but his brother continued on as planned and his diary, later excerpted and published, plus Sinclair's own recollections proved to be the only research necessary when time came to dash off MANTRAP. <br /> <br />Sinclair Lewis, as he had for the American Midwest, in MANTRAP created a fictitious swathe of northern Canada populating it with non-existent rivers and lakes, some named after real ones in Minnesota and Wisconsin. It is the mid 1920s. Ralph Prescott, 40 year old bachelor and mama's boy, (but he pulls in $40,000/year as a lawyer in New York City) is persuaded by E. Wesson Woodbury, Babbitty executive of a stockings company,  member of the same Westchester County golf club as Ralph, to join him for several weeks in summer roughing it in northern Canada. They will paddle canoes, portage their gear overland, fish, hunt, meet Indians and fur trappers and live the the simple, rugged life of the great outdoors.  <br /> <br />Prescott made the trip because he was working long hours for no good reason and under self-imposed stress. Once on the trail and in the canoes, however, he came to detest the bullying, self-important Wes Woodbury, who exults in simply being north of latitude 53. There arrives at one of their camping spots (unknown to all, a 1587 missionary foundation) 46 year old Canadian fur trader Joe Easter. Joe owns a store at Mantrap Landing on Lac Qui Reve. Ralph soon regards Joe as a true friend and begs him to take him away from Wes Woodbury. Joe does. <br /> <br />As their canoe heads toward Mantrap Landing, Joe tells of a visit last year to Minneapolis where he met and married a spunky manicurist, Alverna, and brought her to live with him in the wilds. Alverna is a famous flirt and Ralph is soon madly in love with her. To break away from undignified temptation, he pushes off in a canoe with a guide to find his original host, Woodbury, about whom he feels increasingly guilty. But Alverna runs away from Joe and persuades Ralph to take her with him back to civilization. Their Indian guide steals their canoe and abandons the lovers just before a vengeful Joe Easter catches up with them and massive forest fires almost engulf all three. The men renew their friendship and Alverna asserts her independence and determination to return to the USA and live her own life, no matter how ditzy that life seems to others. Ralph intends to take Joe to New York and make him a city man. At the station in Winnipeg Alverna's two male admirers put her on a train for Minneapolis. But Joe refuses to travel on to New York with Ralph. End of story. As literature: an easy, pleasant, undemanding read worth perhaps TWO STARS * *. <br /> <br />There are, fortunately, also other reasons to read MANTRAP. <br /> <br />First, Sinclair Lewis gives a feel for Canada's wilderness regions: riding in a caboose, in steamboats and overnighting in cheap, dirty hotels. Adding to the backdrop are RC Mounted Police, canoes, fur traders and more. We go inside a Cree encampment with \\"Indian men magnificently doing nothing, thinking nothing and wanting nothing\\" (Ch. Six). There is fishing. There are dogs and the Northern Lights. All are described as well and lovingly as Sinclair Lewis always describes the glittering surface of things. <br /> <br />Next, speaking to us in the year 2005, there is the theme of \\"stress management.\\" Off to the wilds of Canada! Pack up your troubles and lose them tramping The Long Trail! In the end, the sheltered city slicker, Ralph Prescott shows true grit. When crisis comes, he somewhat implausibly surmounts all manner of primitive challenges and returns refreshed and in triumph to the big city. <br /> <br />Note also scattered religious references: Wes Woodbury made what he is by \\"the sanctity of salesmanship\\" (Ch. Eight). How, we are invited to wonder,  did fur trader Joe Easter handle prayer, \\"alone for day after day on the winter trails -- prayer and the hand of Omnipotence in the wilds?\\" (Ch. Nine). <br /> <br />There you have MANTRAP. <br /> <br />-OOO-	2005-07-02

She is not pretty, not well educated. How then does she rise in a man's world? <br /> <br />First, she is friendly and makes enough affable acquaintances and a few friends (increasingly  they are women) that she creates a booster or referral network which she can call on and does call on. Networking, beginning with contacts in a New York City commercial school, from time to time help her find a better job: first just stenographic, then secretarial and lightly supervisory and finally with real responsibility for selling real estate. On her own she markets herself to her final employer who takes her into his recently formed and expanding chain of hotels as a manager of several departments. <br /> <br />Along the way Una Golden forms a crush on a man who leaves New York for a better job in Omaha. She later marries unsuitably an alcoholic womanizer much older than she. Him she dumps eventually as he becomes more and more a lazy sponger. In the end she is reunited, most implausibly, at age 34 with her first love and the implication is that they will marry, have children and both continue to work -- something her old fashioned husband forbade Una to do once he was back on his feet economically. <br /> <br />Unlike ELMER GANTRY or THE GOD SEEKER, Sinclair Lewis's THE JOB is relentlessly, single-mindedly, depressingly secular and this worldly. Here are some of the very few references of any kind to organized religion. <br /> <br />Of Una's father just before he dies at novel's beginning:  \\"He believed that all Parisians, artists, millionaires, and socialists were immoral. His entire system of theology was comprised in the Bible, which he never read, and the Methodist Church, which he rarely attended; and he desired no system of economics beyond thecurrent platform of the Republican party.\\" ( Ch. I). <br /> <br />On their first dinner date, Una's first boyfriend (who returns in triumph at novel's end) asks \\"Which god do you favor at present -- Unitarian or Catholic or Christian Science or Seventh-Day Advent?\\" Una thought that they all worshipped the same God. He says that the same God can't both approve candles and music in an Episcopal Church and reveal to the Plymouth Brotherhood the wickedness of organs and candles.\\" Una agrees that she really does not care which church is right. He goes on to say that church buildings are touted as God's houses but are allowed by congregants to be ugly. But he admits that his real thoughts about almost anything are critical and negative. End of discussion. (Ch V) <br /> <br />Another suitor spoke with Una after \\"(s)he had been to church; had confessed indeterminate sins to a formless and unresponsive deity. She felt righteous and showed it.\\" (Ch. IX) <br /> <br />Una moved into a rather posh and nominally strict boarding house for working women that as a matter of policy admitted \\"East Side Jews\\" but \\"no agnostics or Catholics.\\" Yet Una's roommate, a Roman Catholic, had got away with telling the landlady that she was a \\"Romanist Episcopalian.\\" Una's encounters with Jewish men and women in various levels of New York business were invariably friendly and productive. Decisively helpful later in Una's business rise was her lame Jewish boarding housemate Miss Mamie Magen, who was brilliant and increasingly well connected in charitable circles. (Ch. XI) Mamie was scornful of \\"half-churches, half-governments, half-educations.\\" Mamie explained New York to Una, brought the metropolis to life. Thanks to Mamie Magen, Una found a two week temporary job with the  jobbing firm of Herzfeld and Cohn, two white-bearded Orthodox Jews. Una had had nebulous prejudices of the Jews then  beginning to conquer New York business. Yet the two partners had merry eyes, gestures of sympathy and created a pleasant, companionable office environment. They were not tyrants but patriarchs, elder workers. They made their office \\"a joyous adventure.\\" Una looked forward each day to her work and learned lessons she would later apply elsewhere about how to humanize the work place. (Ch. XIV) In her next to last office, the dynamic Jewish partner in a real estate office proposed marriage, but Una merely admired him, did not love him. (Ch. XVI) <br /> <br />With her Catholic roommate Una \\"attended High Mass at the Spanish church on Washington Heights ... ; felt the beauty of the ceremony; admired the simple, classic church; adored the padre; and for about one day planned to scorn Panama Methodism and become a Catholic, after which day she forgot about Methodism and Catholicism.\\" (Ch. XII) In the first two years of her marriage, Una's salesman husband was out of town 2/3 of the time and she herself did not work. To keep her shorthand alive, she took down \\"the miscellaneous sermons -- by Baptists, Catholics, Reformed rabbis, Christian scientists, theosophists, High Church Episcopalians, Hindu yogis, or anyone else handy -- with which she filled up her dull Sundays. ... Except as practice in stenography she found their conflicting religions of little value to lighten her life. The ministers seemed so much vaguer than the hard-driving business men with whom she had worked; and the question of what Joshua had done seemed to have little relation to what Julius Schwirtz (her husband) was likely to do. The city had come between her and the Panama belief that somehow, mysteriously, one acquired virtue by enduring dull sermons.\\" (Ch. XVI) <br /> <br />In THE JOB Sinclair Lewis shows little belief in religion as able to uplift and change lives of his characters. And those lives emphatically need uplifting from the relentlessly dull, stressful, slave-like conditions most women face in their low-paying office jobs. Sinclair Lewis's women generally see only two ways out of having to work:to marry or to die in harness. A few women such as Una Golden and Mamie Magen break out of their pre-ordained ruts and create a third possibility: doing better work than their men colleagues and convincing progressive bosses to give them a chance to prove themselves. <br /> <br />-OOO-	2005-06-29

Hence, Sinclair Lewis's THE PRODIGAL PARENTS could do no more than anticipate The Beaver, Archie Bunker, Dan and Rosie, Ted Bundy, Samantha of Bewitched and other later favorites. <br /> <br />The novel's hero, Frederick William Cornplow (\\"Fred\\"), on the eve of his 56th birthday, is a very successful retailer and wholesaler of automobiles and recreational vehicles. He has solicitously taken good financial care of his parents and siblings. He is very fond of his kindly wife Hazel. But he draws the line (in theory if not always in practice) when it comes to coddling his demanding \\"you owe me a living\\" 28 year old Vassar graduate Sara (baptized Sarah) who still lives comfortably at home and gives no sign of moving out. Then there is Fred's and Hazel's handsome college student son Howard, a dreamer of fantastic dreams without a practical bone to his name. Curiously, Howard is much loved by Annabel Staybridge, daughter of the richest, most aristocratic businessman in Sachem Falls, New York. <br /> <br />Fred shakes up his children when he announces out of nowhere that we will retire in one year and travel. This does not fit in with the plans of his children, especially Sara. Fred has to stay Fred and take care of them! The rest of the novel presents Fred constantly plotting ways to get away at least for a vacation with his wife while the children generally succeed in frustrating Fred's plans. Sara goes so far as to insist the family doctor examine her father. Fred passes with flying colors. She then tricks him into being interviewed by a psychiatrist. That is the limit for Fred who then sneaks off with his wife and spends five glorious months on ships and ashore from England to Constantinople and finally southern France. Fred and Hazel were almost cut off at the dock in Boston by son Howard and pregnant wife Annabel, Fred's most sincere admirer after his wife. <br /> <br />Fred wantstime off to find out who he is and what is his reason for living. His children, friends, critics and doctor provide a consensus that Fred is a very ordinary person, a creature of habits which he is too weak-willed ever to break. Fred is small and must be kept small. He is not to expect much of himself. After all, no businessman is of interest to anyone except for what he does and what he earns.  <br /> <br />Against all this Fred rebels, with a certain amount of success. Since 1914 there had been growing a counter-revolution of parents against the rebellion of Youth (Ch. 38). To him it was the Fred Cornplows down through the centuries who created civilization. Egyptian Cornplow planned the pyramids and showed  compassion to sweating slaves. A Roman Fred Cornplow had conquered Syria and ruled it with justice. In the Dark Ages Father Abbot Cornplow innovated in agriculture and in building stones. Under Oliver Cromwell Fred Cornplow had tamed ecclesiastics. The American Civil War was not between Grant and Lee but \\"between Private Fred Cornplow of Massachusetts and Private Ed Cornplow of Alabama.\\" Cornplows had been John Bunyan and Lord Byron. Once his name was pronounced Babbitt; another time it was Ben Franklin. \\"He is the eternal Bourgeois, the bourjoyce, the burgher, the Middle Class...\\" \\"He is Fred Cornplow; and when he changes his mind, that crisis is weightier than Waterloo or Thermopylae\\" (ch. 13) As he travels abroad, Fred hopes wistfully and at the end of the road to \\"be minutely great\\" after a lifetime of hard work where he was to others merely \\"greatly small\\" (Ch. 36).  <br /> <br />The recurring Sinclair Lewis theme that travel, travel anywhere, just might bring enduring solutions to human problems is underscored in THE PRODIGAL PARENTS as in his last novel WORLD SO WIDE when Fred Cornplow approvingly quotes Kipling, <br /> <br />\\"For to admire an' for to see, <br />For to be'old this world so wide-- <br />It never done no good to me, <br />But I can't dropit if I tried.\\" <br /> <br />Under ceaseless criticizing by his gimme, gimme son and daughter, Fred hammers out some truths about American families. Children have become bossy and scare their parents (Ch. 26). When Howard and Annabel marry, Fred doesn't mind the idea of a grandson but does not \\"figure on being both granddad and dad\\" (Ch. 29). <br /> <br />The novel's already brisk pace accelerates toward the end. Daughter in law Annabel and recently born Franklin Delano Cornplow arrive unannounced on the cote d'azur. She has left Howard Cornplow, who has become a drunken mess. Fred rushes back home alone to Sachem Falls to find his daughter Sara now married and happily bossing her husband. Fred nurses Howard back to health and takes him fishing in Canada. There one day Fred's wife Hazel who is also Howard's mother arrives at their lakeside fishing camp in a canoe piloted by a tall Indian. She reports that Annabel is in Paris studying. Their baby is there too, thriving. His mother tells Howard that his wife \\"ought to stay away until you earn her.\\" That is a novel idea to the much pampered Howard. But he assents: \\"Hm, Man earn his own wife? Well, maybe it isn't such a sour idea. It' ll be something to work for.\\" (Ch. 40) And the Cornplow family begins to knit itself back together. <br /> <br />Everyman can dream of greatness. Everyman occasionally breaks the habit  of being ordinary and tastes greatness or at least tastes now and then doing what he would like to do. That taste will have to suffice. <br /> <br />-OOO-	2005-06-23

Sometimes he praises  altruistic service. More often he skewers hypocritical politeness and feigned kindness as mere marketing ploys to sell inferior products. His 1934 novel about hotels and hotel management, WORK OF ART, is especially heavy on attention to service. <br /> <br />In WORK OF ART three generations of the Weagle family grow up in and work for boarding houses, inns and hotels. Focus is on two brothers, Myron and Ora, of the second generation. Poetic, ethereal Ora could not wait to escape hotel drudgery, though never too proud to ask plodding Myron for money.  <br /> <br />As Myron thought, learned and managed a steady climb to national respect within the expanding world of early 20th Century hotel managers, he was always skeptical when praised for \\"creativity\\" at Rotary Club luncheons and Chamber of Commerce dinners. He dreamed minutely of the shape of his perfect inn or dream hotel: its napkins, its menus, its front desks, its coddling of guests. Yet he never quite pulled off perfection. <br /> <br />Myron argued with younger brother Ora about whether it was even possible to combine money making with administering institutions. \\"Maybe there were business men, and successful ones, who were not money grubbers, but creators, he suggested\\" (Ch.4). Myron tried hard to combine these two talents, but never quite succeeded. If anyone could pull this combination off, it was the much admired traveling salesman, J. Hector Warlock whom Myron began noticing when only 15 while front desking the family owned American Hotel in Black Thread, Connecticut. Warlock \\"could sell fleece-lined overshoes in hell! (Ch. 4) Over time he convinced Myron that all trades evolve: barbering becomes surgery. Taverns become inns, become hotels and someday most people will live in hotels instead of houses.  <br /> <br />Young Myron learned the service dimension ofjust being friendly from American Hotel bartender Jock McCreedy. Bartenders held democratic court in pre-Prohibition America. Myron Weagle learned as well  to manage inebriated businessmen and \\"lonely and love-starved women\\" (Ch. 9) living in hotels. By 1904 theoreticians of hotel management were already agreed that a hotel staffer owed guests \\"a metaphysical blessing called 'Service'; that he should be at once the Little Brother and the Kind Uncle of everyone who registered -- call them by name ... and ask them tenderly about the Folks, illnesses, weather, and business conditions Back Home\\" (Ch. 11). But Myron never excelled in \\"oozing unfelt cordiality.\\" <br /> <br />Myron came to admire the great hotels as excelling even churches, universities, forts and hospitals for knowing \\"the heart and blood circulation of history\\" (Ch. 11). He met and liked Luciano Mora, whose family had kept six generations of inns and hotels in Naples. Together they fanatically glorified \\"innkeeping as veritably an art\\" (Ch. 15). Hotel management was far more than just an interesting way to make a living. <br /> <br />COMMENT: In February 1905 the Rotary Club of Chicago was created, launching the entire service club movement. In this centennial year 2005 Rotarians are learning that it was in 1934's WORK OF ART that a prissy school superintendent in Black Thread, Connecticut made a much quoted linkage between \\"two great spiritual awakenings\\": Boy Scoutism and Rotarianism: \\"a Boy Scout is a young Rotarian, and every Rotarian is a Boy Scout in long trousers!\\" (Ch. 17) <br /> <br />Mryon rose. Myron fell. Myron bounced back. In 1932, towards novel's end, in his early 50s with his management career in shreds, he used his last savings for a hot summer drive with family to tiny Lemuel, Kansas. Things looked bleak and dull but Myron's \\"Rotarian enthusiasm,\\" comic though it was, propelled him on.  In Kansas Myron built and then transformed The Commercial Hotel. But minor magic came as well. For the first time ever, his wife Effie May became \\"a hotelman's wife\\" as had Myron's mother before her. Teen age son Luke Weagle, age 16 in 1933, also opted for a future in hoteling and warmed his father by suggesting a great development  site for a new approach to America's rising world of automobile tourists, whose idea of a vacation was simply to drive all over the place for the sheer fun of driving on passable roads. <br /> <br />Sinclair Lewis, as always, tells a great yarn: this time about the ups and downs in a rising America's unending pursuit of craftsmanship and material success. <br /> <br />-OOO-	2005-06-16

You are 17 years old. Your mother died when you were ten. You are an only child. Your father was local school superintendent. But he died a year ago leaving you a legacy of $1,000. What do you do next? <br /> <br />You draw on your father's and Waubanakee's values and walk with open eyes into the ripening American world ahead from 1907 to 1933. You wait tables to put yourself through Point Royal College for Women in Connecticut. You grow through the amorous advances of a lesbian roommate and a playboy male professor. You study nursing. You stuff envelopes for years so that American women can vote. You go to jail for the cause and later become an expert on women's prisons. You write a learned book and are a popular national columnist. You have made love to three men over the decades, had one abortion greatly regretted, and after age 40 joyfully birthed a son whose father may either be your cloying husband or a charming rogue who sits on the New York State supreme court until he is convicted of being on the take and sentenced to six years in jail. When the judge is pardoned by the Governor (FDR?) after only a year behind bars, you, he and your son plan to defy convention and make a life together.  <br /> <br />You are the same Ann Vickers, onetime tomboy of Waubanakee, onetime devotee of the YWCA and Presbyterian Sunday School. You have taken things as they came your way, made your choices and lived with them. And you were written up in a novel by Sinclair Lewis which I defy a reader in 2005 to put down prematurely. <br /> <br />Themes in the novel to be pondered: <br /> <br />--A mother is persuaded by a professor of obstetrics to have an abortion she does not want and who dreams ever after of her \\"murdered\\" girl \\"Pride.\\" A mother who will never murder Pride again and who knows that \\"coming children\\" have rights. <br /> <br />--A feminist who never despises men utterly. Most males are taken to be \\"solid, stolid, unpicturesque citizens who liked breakfast, went to their offices or shops or factories at seven or eight or nine, admired sports connected with the rapid propulsion of small balls ... quarreled with their wives and nagged their children yet were fond of them and for them chased prosperity...\\" ( Ch. 21, p. 256) <br /> <br />--A married liberal woman goes to parties and hears so much TALK in which people per Roget's Thesaurus \\"cry, roar, shout, bawl, halloo, whoop, yell, bellow, howl, scream, screech, screak, shriek, shrill, squeak ... yawp, vociferate ... rend the air...\\" (Ch. 35, p. 421f) <br /> <br />--Ann Vickers squeezes her lover's wife's hand when the judge is sentenced to jail. This is not the first novel in which Sinclair Lewis puts two women with claims on the same man face to face. <br /> <br />--America came of age in the early and middle lifetime of Ann Vickers. What a time! \\"Hijackers murdering bootleggers. ... Aviators crashing on cottages and burning up old ladies in them. Babies kidnaped and murdered. ... Methodist bishops accused of stock-gambling and rigging elections. ... Five-year-old boys in nice suburbs playing gangster and killing three-year-old boys. ... A skinny little Hindu that drinks only goat's milk baffling the whole British Empire. ... A nation of one hundred and twenty million people letting a few fanatics turn it from beer to poison gin.\\" (Ch. 46, p. 541f) <br /> <br />See if you can resist temptation to read and love ANN VICKERS. <br /> <br />-OOO-	2005-06-10

Mencken's \\"boobus americanus.\\" One cannot fail to notice that the novel's hero Lowell T. Schmaltz is an air head. Or that he talks too much about things of little salience to anything. Schmaltz moves in the same circles as Lewis's unforgettable realtor George Babbitt but lacks any of Babbitt's humanizing touches. And yet, and yet Schmaltz is recognizable as representing millions of ordinary, bumbling American Dagwoods. That is, if you can imagine an utterly self-absorbed humorless Dagwood Bumstead. <br /> <br />Critics tell us that Sinclair Lewis was tired of writing increasingly well researched, carefully plotted novels like MAIN STREET and BABBITT. He wanted some time off and for a lark, and to please his pal Mencken, he dashed off in THE MAN WHO KNEW COOLIDGE the kind of manic monologues that Lewis himself was likely to launch at parties on the slightest provocation. The result is shaggy dog humor, deliberate low-brow nonsense and is weirdly effective. Plot there is none unless, in its six parts, there is steadily unraveled Lowell T. Schmalz's claim to any slightest sort of credibility in invoking his college day acquaintance with future President Calvin Coolidge. <br /> <br />Yet notable quips, asides and observations abound. Examples: <br /> <br />PART I \\"The Man Who Knew Coolidge\\" <br /> <br />--Behind every great surgeon, lawyer, banker or department-store owner there stands...\\"the office-supply man! ...Just take filing-cabinets alone!\\"  <br /> <br />--George F. Babbitt and I, \\"we're as different as Moses and Gene Tunney.\\" <br /> <br />--\\"I've always felt the Catholics were too tolerant toward drinking and smoking and so aren't, you might say, really hardly typically American at all.\\" <br /> <br />--\\"every truck had on it a great big red sign, \\"Free Outing for the Unfortunate Kiddies, provided Free by Zenith Kiwanis Club.\\" <br /> <br />PART III \\"You Know How Women Are\\" <br /> <br />--\\"I guess that in the vacuum cleaner America has added to the world its own mystery, that'll last when the columns of the Acropolis have crumbled to mere dust!\\" <br /> <br />PART VI \\"The Basic and Fundamental Ideals of American Citizenship\\" <br /> <br />--\\"it is thinkers like Dr. (Elmer) Gantry... who finally determine our philosophy ... and our ethics...\\" <br /> <br />--\\"Rotarians and Kiwanians\\" have insisted on \\"the religion of Service.\\" <br /> <br />Imagine L'il Abner Yokum in the big city. Fancy an  Archie Bunker who never lets anyone else talk. Or an Al Bundy who reads books. Then think back to a world of 1928 and you have their archetype, Lowell T. Schmaltz, THE MAN WHO KNEW COOLIDGE. The book is a hoot. <br /> <br />-OOO-	2005-06-04

His last novel, published shortly after his death, is set in Florence and portrays a segment, generally unlovely, of Florence's expatriate communities, mainly American. <br /> <br />WORLD TOO WIDE is the story of young, recently widowed ex-Army major and architect Hayden Chart. He strives mightily to find personal meaning in Florence. Beautiful fellow American Dr Olivia Lomond is a budding scholar who  tempts him to make his mind grow in appreciation of art and history. But earthy, honest Roxanna Eldritch,home town girl and reporter sent to Europe to cover the 1950 Holy Year in Rome, improbably wins Chart's heart in the end. <br /> <br />Apart from its utility as a tourist guide to Florence, WORLD TOO WIDE is Sinclair Lewis's last chance to skewer pretentiousness and hypocrisy. His instrument for ferreting out lies among the expatriates is red-headed American reporter Roxanna (Roxy) Eldritch. She had been a friend of Hayden's recently deceased wife back in their native Newlife, Colorado. Towards novel's end Roxy punctures the facades of two expatriates.  <br /> <br />First is young, proto-fascist pseudo-intellectual American Lorenzo Lundsgard who is preparing a series of lectures supported by films and shoddy research designed to prove that history teaches that great men have always ruled the world through their innate gifts of leadership. Roxy's contacts as a journalist allow her to confront him with his lies about his real Christian name, Oley. He had, moreover, been married twice and was twice messily divorced, despite his claims never to have wed. Lundsgard is a favorite of and financially dependent on the next phony that Roxanna skewers. <br /> <br />With Lorenzo, Roxy was just warming up for Sir Henry Belfont, an English gentleman's English gentleman, a snob with infinite contempt for all things American. Roxy's sources have revealed Sir Henry's true past: he was born in Ohio; his grandfather had made afortune selling shoddy goods to both sides in the Civil War; Lundsgard never saw England until age 14, later bought a seat in Parliament and a title. The enraged Belfont turns on Lundsgard, cuts off his funding for research, lectures and documentary films and, somehow, some way, drives our hero Hayden Chart definitively into the arms of the spunky, honest, all American Roxy Eldritch. Lundsgard then inexplicably lands a cushy foreign service job in South America and Olivia Lomond seems disposed to go there with him at the curtain. <br /> <br />In 1914 Sinclair Lewis's first novel OUR MR. WRENN began outside the Nickelorion movie house in New York City. 1951's WORLD TOO WIDE, Lewis's final novel, endedwith the hero and his new bride happily in a bar in Ravenna, Italy. The world of SInclair Lewis was not often deep but it was always wide. He traveled through it ever restless to end in drink, dissipation and loneliness. R.I.P.  <br />-OOO-	2005-06-03

He had been wounded in 1943 as a Captain in the US Army. He \\"piously\\" (after the fashion of the Roman hero Aeneas) promises his father to look into a family legend (communicated surprisingly  late to the hero) that the Kingsbloods are descendants of English royalty. Nothing is clear one way on the other on the paternal side of genealogy. But interviews with his father's mother and then with a Minnesota historian reveal first that Neil's great, great, great maternal grandfather, the Canadian voyageur Xavier Pic, had a Chippewa wife. And shortly thereafter there is convincing documentary evidence that Pic himself was 100% black, having been born on the isle of Martinique around 1750. <br /> <br />That makes the startled Neil Kingsblood both 1/32 black as well as heavily Native American. What to do about it? There had been and was still no suspicion among any family members or friends and business colleagues that the Kingsbloods were (by certain American, mainly Southern, standards) legally black. No one need therefore ever find out. And it was pretty clear that if the word got out, the results would not be pretty. <br /> <br />Yet Neil, a man not otherwise noted for boldness or delicate conscience, decides to \\"come out,\\" even after being advised not to by newfound black friends in the city of Grand Republic, Minnesota. The results are even more awful than a reader nearly 60 years after the fictional events might imagine. Neil loses job after job. His wife is socially ostracized. Eventually even his young daughter is snubbed as well. Family members of his generation beg him to keep quiet. When he does not, a marriage does not take place. A divorce occurs. Neil is blamed for his father's sudden death. Bloody mindedness spreads. <br /> <br />At the end of the novel, the hero, his family and some armed black friends fire on an angry mob massing at the Kingsblood home after community leaders fail to persuade them to move out of the semi-prestigious all-white neighborhood. The police move in to arrest Neil and others but exempt Neil's wife Vestal, daughter of a community leader. She however remains true to Neil to the end. She assures her arrest by hitting a policeman over the head with a pistol. <br /> <br />The story may sound far-fetched. But remember 1925 when black Doctor Ossian Sweet moved into an angry previously all white neighborhood on the East Side of Detroit. Shots from inside Sweet's house killed a demonstrator outside. Defended by Clarence Darrow, Sweet was acquitted. (No one was killed in KINGSBLOOD ROYAL). But racial violence rose through the next twenty years in Detroit.  <br /> <br />Anti-black racism was still strong in 1947 when KINGSBLOOD ROYAL hit the streets. In some small way Sinclair Lewis may have almost succeeded in laughing American racial idiocy away. <br />	2005-05-31

Carl Ericson, born in the same 1885 and in the same small town Minnesota as Sinclair Lewis, is the hero of Lewis's second novel, THE TRAIL OF THE HAWK (1915). Early on,  mentors at home and in college convince Carl that there is something better than routine, conformity and merely making a living. Somewhere out on a long trail, possibly a trail with no end, there is a goal, a state of being, that will leave anyone contented, happy and living at the outermost limit of his talents. <br /> <br />Carl Ericson has a bent for mechanical things: automobiles, gliders. After being expelled from mediocre Plato College for defending an unorthodox teacher, he wanders for many months through countries and occupations. Nothing holds him for long until, in California, he senses that he was meant to be a pilot. He proves one of the best of the flying pioneers, is called a \\"Hawk of the Birdmen\\" and is transformed into Hawk Ericson, hero to rich and poor, to common people and aristocrats. All but inevitably, however, in those dangerous early days of racing and barnstorming monoplanes and biplanes, the Hawk crashes and goes into hospital. <br /> <br />Prudence damps down his soaring. He finds a job with an automobile manufacturer, invests his flying winnings in the company's efforts to create an early \\"RV,\\" and proves a solid craftsman and leader of men doing important work. But Carl was now \\"a dethroned prince. He had been accustomed to a more than royal court of admirers. Now he was a nobody the moment he went twenty freet from his desk\\" (Ch. XXIV). <br /> <br />Was there anything that would prevent Hawk from bolting once again from on the job hum drum? From hitting the trail all alone once more yearning for something higher and better? It might be that love of the right woman would give him excitement off the job. He had several choices, Gertie, his old boyhood pal, soft, plump, stable or Ruth, a thin aristocratic friend made in New York. Ruth sparkles, is amusing and shares with Hawk the heart of a carefree vagabond. Gertie is unwilling even to walk out into the snow with Hawk. Ruth, by contrast, is willing to run off with him to the South Seas. Ruth, in the end, becomes the female \\"playmate\\" that Carl has always needed. One kiss (Ch.XXXIX) \\"and Carl knew that life's real adventure is not adventuring, but finding the playmate with whom to quest life's meaning.\\" The coming of World War One in August 1914 overcomes the rich girl's doubts about living what may be a life of privation and Hawk and Ruth wed.  <br /> <br />They have a vocation they can clearly share, \\"keeping clear of vocations\\" (Ch XLII). They sail in February 1915 for Argentina aboard the S.S. Sangrael (Holy Grail). In Buenos Aires, Hawk will sell American automobiles, at least for a while. After that, Hawk and Ruth Ericson  will hit the upward trail together and stay on it as long as they can, spreading \\"Madness among the Respectable.\\" <br /> <br />In Carl (Hawk) Ericson there is presented the recurring Sinclair Lewis male hero who is never content for long where he is, who must always roam \\"somewhere else,\\" to \\"greener pastures.\\" Only once does a Lewis protagonist, Dr. Arrowsmith, find something close to paradise and that only by renouncing ordinary human man-woman love for life in an ascetic community of celibate males. Contentment is not something likely  to be found on this earth or in anything this world offers.	2005-05-18

Contemporary critics treated this late work as if they were waiting for  an aging Babe Ruth to break his own home run record once again in his final year at bat. Perhaps THE GOD-SEEKER lacks the wall-clearing oomph of ELMER GANTRY, but it is a solid inside the park home run by a master student of American evangelical religion. It is time for a publishing revival of THE GOD-SEEKER.    For the novel is vintage Sinclair Lewis. Hero Aaron Gadd falls in love with two women at once durng his career as a novice missionary among the Minnesota Sioux. He faces the recurring Sinclair Lewis \\"great decision:\\" to be single-minded (and probably celibate) in the pursuit of (in this instance \\"religious\\") greatness or instead to \\"play\\" with women and bloviate, hunt and fish with men friends and other distractions. There is no happy compromise with any man's call to any form of greatness.    The story moves quickly from one scene to another: with Aaron Gadd a youth in rocky New England, coming of age on the wild Minnesota frontier, maturing into a solid, sometimes avant garde citizen of Territorial Minnesota.    And then there is made-in-America religion throughout: churches and fads of the late 1840s: cultists, nudists, free thinkers, Calvinists and anti-Calvinists, theologians and American pulpit glory seekers. The book is worth reading for its serious, humorous and satirical portrayals of religion if for no other reason.     Astonishly good, satiric, often true, deeply tragic is chapter 41 in which \\"I, Black Wolf, son of Shining Wind, of the Wahpeton Council Fire, being a pure-blood Dakota and a member of the medicine lodge, but having attended a school of the white people [NOTE: OBERLIN COLLEGE], am herewith warning my people....\\" against the white invaders and their superstitions. To this patriotic Sioux, the Catholic Trinity is Father, Son and Mother Mary. \\"The Protestants have no trinity, but a four-god council consisting of Father, Son, Holy Spirit and Satan.\\"  White people's demigods include Santa Claus, witches, vampires and spirits of the dead. This is cross-cultural humor verging on the intoxicated (which Black Wolf sometimes was). But Jesus was a brave, poor, humble \\"beautiful young god\\" whom the Sioux can easily worship.    THE GOD-SEEKER is not on film, is not one of the 25 known movie or TV adaptations of a Lewis novel or short story. But it should be. It tells one person''s life from boyhood to a religious mission, to service to slaves and the poor, to mastery of a craft, to marriage and fatherhood. And it presents many snapshots of American religious leaders, real and fictional. The novel abounds with the religious texture of America, mainly northern but also southern in one or two cases.    At the close of Ch. 16, one of the youthful Aaron Gadd's Massachusetts pastoral mentors left  this advice somewhere deep forever in Aaron's memory: \\"Our forebears ought to of loved the Baptists, but they drove 'em out. If you ever get to be a minister, Aary, you love wrong Christians just as much as you love right Christians. The shadow of the same cross falls on both of them.\\"    THE GOD-SEEKER is studded with descriptions, aphorisms, debates and humor which thoroughly deserve new readers.     -OOO-	2005-05-14

There is a quixotic young man or woman (or both) yearning to chuck job, neighborhood, small town or boredom for travel and adventure in at least relatively exotic places, yearning hotly for \\"somewhere else.\\" There is personal loneliness and the hero's growing sense that being lonely is the greatest problem of his life. Experiments are made to counteract loneliness: plunging feverishly into work, seeking unattainable women friends, settling for conventional but reliable male friends, or such blind alleys as drink and dissipation. <br /> <br />Can narrowly focused work alone make a man happy? Must a man have more interests than his work, no matter how distracting those \\"temptations\\" are: e.g. golf, a wife, going to operas, children, travel? Can anyone possibly \\"have it all?\\" If not, is it desirable to strike a balance between work and play? <br /> <br />Lewis's first novel, the 1914 OUR MR. WRENN: THE ROMANTIC ADVENTURES OF A GENTLE  MAN probes such questions. William Wrenn, age 34 in 1910, is a bachelor who frequents motion picture halls and saves his pennies for travel to fabulous India or Java. He has worked for some years for a New York job house buying and selling knickknacks. One fine day, he gets a modest legacy which permits him to quit his work, give notice to the landlady of his boarding house and ship out on a cattle boat for Liverpool. During a few weeks in London and tramping about the English countryside Our Mr. Wrenn continues evolving into his latent personality \\"Bill Wrenn,\\" a bully boy tough who had proven himself with his fists on the cattle boat. In London Wrenn meets the gorgeous red headed art student Istra Nash who teaches him to \\"play\\" with her and be on thelookout with her for rare \\"interesting persons. But Istra treats him in a motherly albeit palsy way and usually calls him \\"Mousey,\\" a name he only slowly outgrows thanks to the all too often listless \\"Bill Wrenn\\" within him. Istra's key question to him is, \\"Who do you play with --know?\\" <br /> <br />In Wrenn's case, at least, \\"playing\\" or dalliance is not a permanent solution to loneliness. He had tried a he man version of it earlier with a comrade on the cattle boat. But playmates of either sex are footloose and do not want permanence or commitment. Nor is Wrenn much tempted by alcohol or sex. Our Mr. Wrenn decides that for him happiness will somehow have to be built on \\"The Job\\" back in New York, on any humdrum unimaginative friends he will be lucky to meet and on not much else.  <br /> <br />Back in New York, Our Mr. Wrenn hurls himself into work with his new found Bill Wrenn drive and hustle and begins to rise within the company. He marries Nelly Croubel, a lingerie saleswoman who offers not much as a playmate, but is kind and loving. His striving, his quest all fall into place for William/Bill during an ordinary walk with his ordinary girl (Ch. XVI): \\"Then, in a millionth of a second, he who had been a wanderer in the lonely grey regions of a detached man's heart knew the pity of love, all its emotion, and the infinite care for the beloved that makes a man of a rusty sales-clerk.\\" -OOO- <br />	2005-05-05

We know what first wife Gracie added, what massive collaborator Paul De Kruif contributed. We know how badly Sinclair Lewis wanted to prove to critics that he was not just a \\"knocker\\" of flawed characters and a negative satirst of an America full of Babbitts. We know how the researching, planning and writing of ARROWSMITH created and consolidated a method of doing fiction that Sinclair Lewis used over and over again. A method hammered out with Paul De Kruif.<br /><br />We think of parallels between the collaborators' nine week research jaunt by ship through the Caribbean and Graham Greene's turning his travels in Liberia and Mexico into books. We wonder why only in ARROWSMITH  Sinclair Lewis created one heroic figure -- again, we notice, in collaboration with  a Paul De Kruif whom Lewis taught to write and who taught Lewis about science and scientific role models.<br /><br />We think of the huge impact of Lewis and ARROWSMITH on the contemporary world, not just in the USA. No potboiler novel could have drawn John Ford to direct the 1931 movie ARROWSMITH. Ronald Coleman played Martin Arrowsmith, Helen Hayes was Leora Tozer and Myrna Loy played Arrowsmith's temptress during the plague on the sultry West Indian isle.<br /><br />In the novel Dr Martin Arrowsmith oscillates between medical careerism and self-sacrificial idealistic devotion to a cause: pure research. There is little room for women in his life, especially if they try to shape the hero up into being a competent tennis player and snappy dresser. In the end, Martin Arrowsmith can become Martin Arrowsmith only in a simply living, tiny male celibate community in the woods of Vermont.

It offers no great insights into psyches or interpersonal relations. Read it rather as a straightforward magazine serial pot boiler romance of frontier boy and car mechanic (Milt Daggett) pursuing a sentimental girl (Claire Boltwood) worth an impressive $5,000 around 1916. The girl, a high living Brooklynite, is driving her ailing workaholic father in a heavy Gomez-Dep roadster long day after weary day across  northern plains and mountains towards a vacation with cousins in Seattle. She wonders whether she can ultimately avoid marrying Jeff Saxton, a notably older beau back in sophisticated New York.  <br /> <br />Milt complicates things by falling in love with Claire after pulling her car out of a Minnesota mud hole created by a German hick to extort money from stranded motorists. Milt almost instantly decides to drive in his modest Teal \\"tin beetle\\" or \\"bug\\" with or near Claire and her father all the way to Seattle. And so it goes, with Claire wondering if she can (or should) civilize the manly Milt up to the level of suave and prosperous Jeff or whether that is too, too patronizing. Should she, alternatively, simply sweep off to Alaska with Milt -- heeding the call of the wild? Were Jane and Tarzan in the back of Sinclair Lewis's mind? For Edgar Rice Burroughs had created them only seven years earlier in 1912. No, the story takes another twist. Read the book and discover what this novel is said to be  \\"prelude and curtain raiser\\" to. <br /> <br />FRESH AIR can also be read just for its sweaty heft as a part of midwestern and western America not long before the nation declared war on the Kaiser. On the drive through Minnesota, North Dakota, etc. to Washington state, roads are rarely paved. Gravel is luxury. Dust is daily. Mud is just around the bend. Tires are thin and frequently burst or are punctured. Steep slopes demand drivers with braking and gear shifting skills. And don't forget lowspots covered by running water. <br /> <br />In every town where the Boltwoods overnight, they routinely drive their Gomez-Dep (a make apparently invented by Sinclair Lewis)  into a sure-to-be-there full service garage for the night. These and other cross country garages often display a sign \\"Free Air,\\" which must have been a reassuring come-on in the early days of cross-continental motoring.  <br /> <br />The author, just one year before his first masterpiece, MAIN STREET, convincingly presents his personally experienced North American driving world from an expert mechanic's point of view: an automobile-crazed country with its starters, carburetors, rumble seats, dubiously effective head lamps, oil leaks, hitchhikers, fleabag hotels, country stores, a haunted house and country people who speak German and at first seem gruff but then are seen by sophisticated Easterner Claire Boltwood to have hearts of gold. As does her new suitor, Milt Daggett. It is an all-American world where even auto mechanics are romantic and knightly. <br /> <br />Boys and girls should read FRESH AIR a year or so before they tackle TOM SAWYER and HUCKLEBERRY FINN. One leads to the others. <br /> <br />-OOO-	2005-04-22

Books	4	4	6	N	Y	A SIMPLE FAITH STRETCHED TOO FAR	COFFEE RINGS is a detective story. Eunice Hogan, soon to die of cancer, takes up for the last time the mystery of why and how 19 years earlier her daughter Dove drowned on the North Carolina coast while swimming with three girl friends. Dove had left a note before driving off during a college break. At the scene of the tragedy Eunice had also found part of her daughter's bathing suit. The police crime report and autopsy differed from the excuses given by the three surviving girls, especially champion swimmer Annette Billings. But Eunice had declined to pursue these clues. And the three girls never volunteered a word.  Eunice, facing certain death, is determined to know the truth and persuades the three friends, now adults, Annette, Ruby and Lara to return with her to the beach for a final accounting. <br /> <br />COFFEE RINGS is also passionate and graphic. Made into a best-selling movie it would be rated R for explicit sex, nudity, violence and suicides. Lehman's characters, like those of the three Bronte sisters, are vexing mixtures of insight and obtuseness and of good and evil; in some people the evil is more insidious and ineradicable than in your ordinary American neighborhood. There are no heroes. <br /> <br />COFFEE RINGS is also unabashedly religious and explicitly, argumentatively, even defensively theological. <br /> <br />Very long for an Yvonne Lehman novel, COFFEE RINGS focuses on a handful of people; and almost all of them belong to one local unnamed evangelical Protestant church. The principal characters (one the minister of that church) are attached by habit and sometimes by deep conviction to their religious community and allocate both themselves and one another into that community's strikingly narrow neo-Calvinist pigeonholes. That church does not, for instance, appear to think often or deeply about baptism or eucharist. And remarriage after divorce is presented offhandedly as if every Christian's right. The church's major \\"sacrament\\" seems to bebible-reading of self-selected texts alone or with others.  Some characters are sure that they can find a Scriptural passage to enlighten or even explain every concrete happening in their lives. Theirs is a religion in which a belief in election, fate and doom interact unpredictably with free will and Scripture.  <br /> <br />At one level this novel is explicitly didactic: designed to spark discussion of its contents within like-minded church groups. Witness its postscript \\"DISCUSSION THOUGHTS,\\" with questions (but no answers) for each of the book's 34 chapters. Samples:  \\"Must one reveal one's past to the person one plans to marry?\\"  \\"Does your church speak out against abortion? Does it offer an alternative?\\" \\"Eunice has kept the coroner's report secret from her husband for nineteen years. Is that right?\\" \\"Should you reveal something that eases your conscience but hurts another?\\"   \\"Is it hypocritical to behave like you're morally upright after you've had an affair?\\"  \\"Is withholding the truth the same as lying?\\"   \\"Are you able to tell other people how they can be sure they will go to heaven when they die?\\"   <br /> <br />To a reader who is Christian but not an evangelical Protestant, the many good deeds, hymns and prayers of the church community described have the ring of authenticity. The theology, however, does not seem nuanced enough to bear all the burdens routinely unloaded upon it by the novel's characters. Either the church's imparted wisdom is received by rote and barely internalized, or, more frighteningly, church teaching guides the believer into relieved personal self-satisfaction that there is no necessary connection between evil deeds and ineligibility for election to salvation and heaven. Each person judges his own righteousness on the basis of Scriptural texts and assigns the verdict to God. <br /> <br />Not all readers of COFFEE RINGS will be closely allied mentally and spiritually to the novel's little mountain Carolina church community. Readersfrom other denominations or non-evangelical faiths might charitably hope that a kindly God has paradoxically led these honest searchers into what seems a temporary theological strait jacket -- but only en route toward a framework more spirit-filled and internally consistent. It might seem unlikely to many readers that Providence intends the people of COFFEE RINGS  to remain so self-contentedly cramped much longer. For  experience suggests that human freedom and human destiny cry out for a universal gospel with larger lungs for breathing. <br /> <br />-OOO-	2004-09-17

Later, before he retired to Western North Carolina, Jack Mahaney's last hurrah was as a volunteer in the White House, screening and pigeonholing love letters sent to then President Bill Clinton from adoring women everywhere. <br /> <br />Nonagenarian Jack Mahaney' writes as clearly and punchily as Ernest Hemingway. Like Robert Louis Stevenson and his  20 years younger Mountain Carolinas contemporary  Lewis W. Green  (OF HUMAN INTEREST), Mr Mahaney is a born \\"teller of tales,\\" a sometimes caustic observer of the passing parade but more often a good humored log keeper on board The Ship of Fools. He is a late but valued arrival in that  increasingly crowded \\"nest of singing birds\\"  of poets, novelists and other writers living in or near Asheville, North Carolina. -OOO-	2004-09-12

Green's novels of the Mountain Carolinas are becoming cult classics. Less well known are his writings over 40 years as reporter, satirist, hurler of invectives and his related work as college teacher and undercover investigator. His latest book, OF HUMAN INTEREST, looks at Mr Green through 57 segments -- panes within one master prism.<br />Green knows and defends old Appalachian mountain values. In his novels and in his reporting there is an underlying layer peopled with mountain people who are pugnaciously independent, utterly unwilling to be told what to do. Every friendship, therefore, is like a marriage, voluntarily entered into,  a conscious contract involving intense two way loyalties. If one party neglects even one thread of the loyalty bond, his partner's just reaction is revenge. And the revenge of the inarticulate can range from contemptuous name calling to murder in ice cold blood. But, conversely, the gratitude for a patronage job when desperately needed lasts forever (p. 15).<br />Add to this old Celtic racial underpinning an influx of flatlanders and you have Asheville, the Theater of the Absurd. According to \\"Colonel Paul Rockwell of the French Foreign Legion\\" (pp. 122 - 125)  the original rulers (not leaders) in the mountains, whether old-timers  or recent immigrants, were men out to create a harmonious, cohesive community, men of high standards, with values money could not buy. They regularly put The People ahead of Business.  Mountain men, including Green himself,  react to flatlander obtuseness with sarcasm and humor (p. 41). People around Green sensed his Old Roman uprightness. Leakers of insider information information to the author included an F.BI. agent and a Federal Appeals Judge (p. 8). Others who sought Green's help against unjust entrenched power included an Asheville lawyer (p.13) and friends of an old black man. Nor was it only blacks who were Muslims who told Lewis Green, \\"You ain't much, man, but you all we got\\" (p. 74).<br />Mountain men see visions and ghosts, too. And when they die, there are ceremonies and the best ones are the stately Masonic burial rites (remember that many a Mountain Cherokee had been a Mason). \\"Doppelgangers, Wraiths, Spirits, etc.\\" (pp. 125 - 130) documents spiritual happenings  from Lewis Green's own growing up. And this underpins mountain folks' unique relation to the land, to their time and that of their ancestors and to their proud but sometimes superstitious reaching out to a stern Old Testament God. In \\"A Backwoods Snake Cult\\" (pp. 163-164) someone had given Rev. Liston Pack in Cocke County, Tennessee an odd kind of water moccasin to use in church services. One look told Green that it was a six-foot long  Queen Cobra. His advice:  \\"Reverend, don't get so anointed you pick that one up. That's not your everyday fundamentalist Cocke County Christian rattlesnake. That's a sophisticated Hindu royal temple snake. She won't understand what you're doing. \\"<br />In his earlier writings (1961 - 1980) Lewis Green shows sympathy for and  patience with lovable rogues, especially if their roots are in the mountains. Thereafter Asheville and environs slide toward Sodom and Gomorrah. And Green's focus and lessening patience turn increasingly to the uncomprehending immigrant flatlanders  whose ridge-top mansions slide mud down into the tobacco farmers' streams and destroy the old ways of life. (See \\"Flatlanders Moving into the Mountains: 1976,\\" pp. 193-197). Flatlanders destroy willy nilly the ancestral man's man, woman respecting religion of the mountaineers, replacing it with touchy-feely, do whatever feels good sexual lawlessness. The author tells of his skirmishes with the growing power of homosexuals in his church, and his well publicized excommunication as an unrepentant troublemaker. Green (p. 225) asserts the \\"significance of the gay movement not only in Asheville but nationwide, if not worldwide. It is perhaps the biggest story of this era\\" (p. 215).He amply documents his crafty but losing one-man aristeia (guerrilla skirmishes) against the cozy New Age Christians at All Souls Cathedral in Asheville.\\"<br />In an appreciation of Green the novelist by Dr. Donald Secrest (reproduced pp. 227 - 235), Lewis Green is affectionately denoted as \\"A Sainted Crazy.\\" Green does not so much plot his stories as bait traps for the unsuspecting reader. In other words, things are never as simple as they first seem. Green is seen as \\"practicing to become a prophet,\\" deeply spiritual in a tradition no flatlander can ever grasp. But then, \\"A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?\\"<br />-OOO-	2004-07-08

Books	3	4	4	N	N	Historical Imagination meets DNA	Was it possible for Emily Bronte to write passionately of a dark lover (WUTHERING HEIGHTS's Heathcliff) without herself having first had a romance with someone very like him? Author Jill Jones imagines that it was so. For no chaste unmarried English lady in the 1840s could have written the poems and novel that Emily Bronte in fact wrote without having met an injured gypsy horse trader on the moors and fallen madly in love. Having taught him to read and write, she eventually carries his child. But the fear of being expelled from her family, should her secret become known, causes Emily to commit voluntary suicide through a combination of starvation and refusal to see a doctor after taking a chill. Thus far the historical imagination of Jill Jones.<br />Nearly 150 years later two competing scholars of the Brontes and two descendants of Mikel the gypsy lover blunder together through the evidence for Emily's secret. In the process they give rein to their own 20th century passions, including lust, jealousy, envy, greed and romance. DNA has its own way of telescoping time.<br />This book's greatest value is its potential to motivate young readers to pick up the poems and novels of the three Bronte sisters and read them with fresh eyes	2004-07-05

Worth reading for its own sake in an often implausibly plotted 504 page novel is one gem of a theological chapter, number 41, pp. 424 - 441. There  Naomi, a thoroughlyy secularized Jew from New York, attends a seder hosted by the only other Jewish people in this part of xenophobic, judgmental, small town New Hampshire -- Joel and Judith Friedman. What unites the two women is determination to see justice done to young, naive Heather Pratt, accused on flimsy grounds of a double infanticide. Heather has entrusted the temporary care of her young illegitimate daughter Polly to Naomi and Judith is Heather's defense lawyer. Chapter 41 contrasts certain Jewish and non-Jewish attitudes and values regarding abuse of power and killing the innocent, taking as a starting point Biblical Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his innocent son at God's command. Also present at the passover ceremony are David, an expert witness for the defense, Judith's sister Rachel and her daughter Hannah and Judith's husband Joel. And 18 month old Polly.<br />The adults speak of assimilated and non-assimilated American Jews (p. 428f). They discuss Rachel's other child, Simon, at home with Rachel's husband. Simon has an incurable degenerative illness. A Talmud tale is told of the angel Gabriel taking a newborn Jewish child maimed by Egyptian officials to show God and remind Him to be merciful. Naomi finds &quot;this God of ours&quot; so cruel (p. 432). Joel replies, God told Moses that He was a jealous God. But remember that He did choose us Jews as His people. After the seder ceremonies, conversation moves on to why the Messiah keeps putting off coming. Why do American Jews abandon their God by assimilating? (p. 432) Why doesn't an omnipotent, all good God at least prevent the suffering of children? Perhaps suffering helps us to understand and value suffering's opposite. Naomi does not believe in God but would like to. David tells of attending a movie about the Rapture with a born again Christian friend (p. 434). The film's main character is an agnostic who watches all her born-again friends suddenly disappear. The atheist Naomi considers herself Jewish by virtue of the DNA of generations of sheer &quot;survivors.&quot; David notes that survival is the theme of the seder. The theme of post- 1945 seders is pointedly defiant: &quot;We're still here&quot; (p. 435). OK, God ended the holocaust, but what was He doing when it started, Naomi wonders? (p. 436).<br />Christians can handle sorrow; for they believe God won't send them suffering so dreadful they can't bear it. But what do we Jews have? No after-life. A God very detached from us but nonetheless constantly testing us. Rachel, bitter about her afflicted child, says that on the Jewish theory, we never pass the test (p. 437) Joel comments that Abraham at least passed the test. Rachel says that God did wrong to test Abraham and thereby condemn Isaac to a life of remembering his father with a knife poised over him. Joel: God knew that Abraham would pass; perhaps He just wanted Abraham to learn how great was his own devotion.<br />Naomi is troubled about a God asking us to kill anyone for any reason at all (p. 438). David welcomes her viewpoint. For the Talmud says that &quot;when the debate is in the service of heaven, both sides are sustained&quot; (p. 438). Naomi presses on: the murder of a child can never be justified (p. 439). The second baby killed in the novel had been born alive. Naomi says nothing could justify its killing, its being stabbed. Judith says that circumstances matter and &quot;It was morphine&quot; (439).<br />Joel: we know this: that Abraham did the right thing and &quot;we were chosen by God as a result of his choice&quot; (p. 439). Naomi thinks that Abraham probably failed the test. &quot;Maybe God wanted to see that Abraham's humanity was greater than his faith&quot; (p. 439) Maybe God then singled out Abraham's descendants &quot;for an eternity of torments&quot;(p. 440).  The other adults react with obvious distaste. Naomi can't decide what she has done wrong? Why had Judith glared at her and left the table? (p. 441) Judith said that her husband Joel does not believe but is trying to believe by a sheer act of his will. Judith says that if there is a God, she does not want Him in her house.<br />My comment: The ideas of Chapter 41 may perhaps be unoriginal or even trite, expressed countless times by intelligent, active participants in America's rich Jewish oral culture. But to me,  a mere fly on the wall at this conversation, much was new and worth pondering. It is a rare pleasure to overhear such good talk by people not afraid to be passionately concerned about their religion. -OOO-	2004-07-04

In America today even that much earlier cultural uniy is gone. There abound Jewish novels, agnostic hymns and wiccan manifestos. On that spectrum Todd Komarnicki's FREE is a Catholic novel with evocations of Newman, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh and others. <br />Consider a few of the pervasively Catholic elements of FREE. (1) The pathetic but striving anti-hero Free (christened Jefferson Alexander Freeman) had been raised Catholic in a dark past preceding his arrival in New Orleans at age 17. He is now as old as Jesus was when he began his public ministry, also after a mysterious childhood. Like Jesus, Free has no place to call his own. But Free is a shattered, pathetic, despairing failing Christian. (2) Free is rebuked by a sympathetic black priest friend for wolfing down communion wafers to still his hunger. (3) The priest and his sister deal with Free from within a Christian world view conditioned to care without questions for a pathetic brother who cannot lose residual dignity. (4) The street-smart, homeless Free embeds glass shards in his head by falling through a church's high stained glass window to the street below. (5) At novel's end Free's wounds are miraculously cleared up in the church of his black priest friend during a sermon on angels and after Free's  vision of angels flying about below the ceiling. Graham Greene would have marked this novel for a second reading.<br />From fantasy to realism:  Komanarcki's treatment of Hong Kong in the years before the 1997 turnover from Britain to Red China. The reader sees Hong Kong through the terrified eyes of local Chinese reacting to the recent violent put down of democracy in Peking. Thousands decide to flee at all costs, to escape to America, to New Orleans. Their legitimate passion for a better life plays into the hands of heroin smugglers who provide the refugeeswith passports and a network of bribed officials who feed them into the USA and to many cities besides New Orleans. In that city a tattoo found on the murdered corpse of one of the Hong Kong Chinese, a red fleur des lis, leads Free and his newly found Chinese American detective girl friend back to the British Crown Colony in a search for the source of an unholy grail. For the fleur de lis is presented as a religious symbol, with both Marian and diabolical overtones. Again, the Catholic perspective resonates with Chesterton and Greene: in which good and evil are sometimes so close as to seem identical.<br />A good read as puzzle, as symbolism, as theology and as a confused soul's notably blind groping for God.	2004-07-02
US	53080931	R2DNS9WFXPJHAD	0967781221	671433805	Always on the way: The autobiography of Sigrid Helliesen Lund (1892-1987)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	An undersung teacher of the Quaker way of life	Sigrid Lund nee Helliesen (1892 - 1987) tells modestly a life story of undersung achievement in her native Norway, in wartime Sweden, Europe east and west, in Africa and in relation to humanitarian activities of Quakers, the Norwegian government and the United Nations.<br />Inn an otherwise bald, chronological narrative filled with detail, Mrs. Lund also displays insights that give her standing as a theologian and proponent of the Quaker faith. While still a girl, she refused confirmation in the Norwegian Lutheran State church because she believed not one dogma of what purported to be a divinely revealed religion (p. 11). In 1947, in her mid fifties she fulfilled an early prophecy of her Lutheran pastor and became a member of the Society of Friends (Quakers) -- one of very few in Norway. Her models were people she had long known from England and elsewhere. Clearly any faith she would with others must first make sense to herself. Any Christo-centrism in Quakerism, of the sort she later met face to face in Ireland and Africa, she explains on purely historical, contingent grounds. Mrs Lund finds the world populated (p. 98) with  individuals having greatly differing subjective needs for religion. Some are happy to accept their family's inherited faith. Others need no religion at all. Yet a third group are seekers and their search is never ending. Quakers are among those searchers. To a seeker &quot;finding&quot; God or an equivalent  personal satisfaction means never ceasing to &quot;seek&quot; within the found for more and more, wider and wider insights.<br />Quakers share no specific creeds but rather certain ways of thinking. They believe in a &quot;Power&quot; found in all people. The duty of Quakers is to advance that power in one's personal life and to be kind and helpful to others. Mrs. Lund goes beyond thinkers like G.K. Chesterton and Graham Greene who find good and evil strikingly, sometimes chillingly close to each other to real identity of that &quot;which is holy and that which is not&quot; (p. 101). No place is more holy than another. No harm comes from differences of religious opinion. From full sympathy with other humans flows Quaker dedication to non-violence. Violence can include purely spiritual oppression. Quakers tend to avoid proselytizing, especially in overseas mission work. Mrs. Lund has &quot;no faith that one can pray for things&quot; (102).<br />In 1958 Sigrid Lund made her only visit to Ireland. &quot;The Quaker group there was the most conservative and evangelistic I have met in Europe. It was hard to understand that they could be Quakers ...&quot; (p. 127). In 1959-60 when attempting to raise funds for a home in Norway for mentally afflicted children, Mrs. Lund had to concede that  Quaker opposition to lotteries and Quaker lack of sympathy for charity bazaars made her task notably difficult (p. 130). <br />In 1961 Sigrid Lund and some friends attended a large international Quaker meeting in Kaimosi, Kenya. &quot;There are over 30,000 black Quakers in Kenya, and they run hundreds of schools and several hospitals&quot; (p. 133). Kenyan Quaker communities had been brought into existence largely by notably Christian and evangelistic non-African Quakers. The Kenyans were understandably shocked by the more modernist views of European confreres attending  the 1961 conference. For Kenyan Quakers &quot;had ministers in their 'churches' and full ritual with Bible readings and hymn singing. But they were much taken by our form, the silence and the spontaneous messages which might come from any participant&quot; (p. 133).<br />The translation from Norwegian into English by the American Kathryn Parke is direct, workmanslike and enriched by occasional interlinear comments and explanations of practices and geography unfamiliar to non-Norwegians. All in all ALWAYS ON THE WAY is a rewarding, easy read of a straightforward narrative and non-apologetic presentation of things Quaker.	2004-06-20

Surprising to me was how different the two are. The book dates from 1972 and perhaps the revisions for the movie are an attempt at a retelling for more recent times.

The book is altogether more conventional, low key and pedestrian. In the book the boy is obviously seriously concerned about his sexuality, which is barely looked at in the film.***<br />On balance, I think the book holds up better. The movie is more like a negative book review of the book than an original film. Normally, films eliminate scenes from a book. THE MAN WITHOUT A FACE adds scenes and changes the ending. This reminds of the pointlessly changed ending of the recent film verion of Graham Greene's THE END OF THE AFFAIR.***<br />The book is indeed an easy, quick read.

This prevented the Axis from sealing off the western end of the Mediterranean and made a major contribution to ultimate Allied victory.<br />What many may, however, learn for the first time in the Jane and Bert Boyars' 2001 documentary novel HITLER STOPPED BY FRANCO is that Franco also got away with provoking Hitler by his bold assistance to Jews.<br />An introductory quote (p. 104): \\"The Sephardim, Jews of Spain and Portugal, had not seen Spain since Ferdinand and Isabella had expelled them in 1492 after giving them the opportunity to remain by becoming true Catholics.\\"<br />Franco's positive attitude towards Jews is at least six years older than Hitler's 1933 rise to power in Germany.  As early as 1927 as a fighting Colonel commanding thousands of men in Spanish Morocco, Francisco Franco received permission from Madrid to use his troops to protect from Muslims the local Sephardic Jews. The Sephardic community was grateful and in 1936 supported Franco with money at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.<br />In 1927 Spanish dictator Primo de Rivera had also told Franco that Sephardic Jews might return to Spain, become citizens and worship as they pleased. This invitation was deep in Franco's memory when, in 1940, French Jews began beseeching Spanish authorities in Vichy France for asylum on the basis of  Spanish citizenship. (p. 104)<br />As told by Franco's wife to the authors, Franco then briefly but decisively mulled over what to do.  \\"...I have sworn to give my life protecting Spaniards.\\" (p. 105)<br />After prayer, Franco authorized issuing Spanish passports to Sephardim as their right under Spanish law. Asked by consular officials how to tell Sephardim from non-Sephardim, Franco ruled, \\"They are all Sephardim.\\"<br />By September 1940 Hitler waspressuring Franco to cede to Germany one of the Canary Islands and to allow the Wehrmacht to march on Gibraltar through Spain. (p.106)<br />By November 1940 Hitler told Serrano Suner, Franco's brother-in-law,  that he had at the moment 186 inactive German divisions and he intended to use some of them to take Gibraltar. Nor had he failed to notice Franco's Jewish policy. \\"Spanish passports are being issued to Jews who have never seen Spain, nor have their ancestors in precisely 448 years. ... Suddenly French are Spanish. And from Poland suddenly Poles are Spaniards. And in Denmark and the Netherlands ... overnight my enemies have Spanish passports and are able to leave my jurisdiction.\\" (p. 159)<br />And leave they did.

Why?***<br />He at once joined, without notable enthusiasm, the Church of Rome, which he had attacked for two decades and which he believed still in need of serious reform. Why?*** <br />And why do this on October 9, 1845, when he had dithered for nearly four years?*** <br />These questions are raised by Yale history professor Frank B. Turner in JOHN HENRY NEWMAN: THE CHALLENGE TO EVANGELICAL RELIGION.***<br />Newman lived from 1801 until 1890, for the first half  Anglican, for the second half  Roman Catholic.  He had been strongly tempted by  agnosticism or even atheism before a life-transforming conversion to Evangelical Christianity at age 15. Staunchly Evangelical as an Oxford undergraduate, he slowly gave up its Calvinistic theology under influence of colleagues of the Oriel College Common Room, moving from Low Church to High Church views. Then, under the spell of his younger colleague Hurrell Froude, Newman became first anti-Evangelical and ultimately anti-Protestant while finding ever more signs of an ideal, mystical Church Catholic in its flawed Roman incarnation.***<br />Frank Turner contends that, in his 1864 APOLOGIA PRO VITA SUA,  Newman put a questionable spin on his Anglican years and the reasons and the timing for becoming Roman Catholic. APOLOGIA left the impression that God was leading Newman from an early age towards peace and fulfillment in the bosom of Rome. Newman's artful re-interpretation for decades held the field. But growing accessibility of his more than 20,000 letters and more attention by scholars to contemporaries' view of Newman as an ecclesiastical wrecking ball within the Anglican Church gave Professor Turner a plausible basis for his revisionist interpretation of why and when Newman became Roman Catholic.***<br />Turner portrays an increasingly sceptical, confused Newman doing everything he can to stay a loyal Anglican. He also points to a wider Victorian\\"conversion\\" milieu to show that deep inside his conscience Newman remained to the end of his Anglican days Evangelical and Protestant in his claimed right to a private judgment and to an autonomous conscience directly linked to a loving God leading him on through severe trials. There was more emotion and personal frustration behind Newman's unconvincing and unenthusiastic conversion to Rome than other historians and biographers commonly assert.***<br />Turner sketches Newman's ever changing day to day relationships: with his parents and five siblings, with friends (primarily male), mentors, critics, church authorities and with his books. From these relations emerges Newman's vision of a God-intended, visible church authoritatively teaching truth and providing channels of holiness. Newman is presented as often in communication at one and the same time on the same issue or decision with God, Church, personal speculations, friends, enemies, family and his Victorian milieu. To Professor Turner  Newman is temperamentally a counter-puncher, reacting to his milieu rather than proactively dominating it.  Newman  is described as Protean, indeterminate--a kind of Aristotelian prime matter passively receiving impressions and forms from everything in his busy daily life of prayer, penance and controversy. Whenever he acquires new friends (e.g. Richard Whately, Hurrell Froude) he is also likely to acquire new ideas and changes of heart and mind. ***<br />Will Newman or won't he--i.e., become Roman Catholic? That was asked by thousands in England and elsewhere when Newman, Froude, Keble and soon Pusey launched the Oxford or Tractarian Movement and with 14 others wrote 90 Tracts for the Times between 1833 and 1841.***<br />Professor Turner emphasizes both Newman's battle against Protestantism and his derivative but growing sympathy for contemporary Roman Catholicism. Newman's becoming Roman was never inevitable. Had Anglican Bishops not rejected Newman's Tract 90 and made it clear that England was a Protestant nation in vigorous opposition to Rome, had he found more warm personal sympathy and more public support  from 1841 to 1845, had his younger monastically inclined coterie not moved so strongly towards and into Rome and away from him as their leader, then Newman would likely have remained within the established Church of England, warts and all.***<br />Newman was also well aware of other viable, socially workable choices taken by eminent Victorians. He might become Methodist or join a dissenting body. He might form his own  sect. He might become a sceptical worldling. To many observers Newman had already tailored a private religion for himself. What drove him to Rome? In large measure mere contingencies, according to Turner. In the end an ecclesiastical court decision against one of his younger disciples, the prospect of a new, less sympathetic Anglican bishop arriving in Oxford, the conversions of his young disciples, such proved the external signs which the perennially Evangelistic Newman demanded of God to prove that it was time for Rome. Not on a planned timetable, but prematurely, shortly before completion of his great book on the development of Christian doctrine, Newman bolted. He simply cut and ran.***<br />This is a book for scholars. But it is so well written and concrete and moves along so deliberately that non-scholars with a couple of preparatory Newman studies under their belts can tackle it with pleasure and gain. In the end Frank Turner makes a fair case that Newman's transplanting himself into the Roman Church was neither inevitable nor entirely rational. Newman to the last moment enjoyed a range of other real choices. Had he followed his head more than his heart, Newman might have turned out very differently from the icon who is today's Venerable John Henry Cardinal Newman, Father of the Second Vatican Council.***<br />The book is long. Its arguments are complex, its speculations many, tantalizing and not always persuasive. It could use but does not have a five page executive summary.

Hill, stands on its own merits as a rollicking good love story, almost gothic in its plague of locusts, demonic possession of the young North African Juba, realistic depiction of mob violence, state torture and intolerance of the rising Christian religion whose adherents refused in the year 250 to worship the persecuting emperor Decius.<br />It is the story of a beautiful 17-year old Greek orphan who finds work as an artisan in Roman Africa, mainly fashioning statues and other adornments of various pagan cults. The evils of third century Roman imperial life depress her. She is tempted by the beauty of Christianity as hinted to her years ago by a Christian slave. Later she is wooed by the Christian Agellius who gives her another slant into his religion--though he fails to persuade Callista to marry him. Finally, Saint Cyprian, bishop of Carthage and the Gospel of Luke which he persuades her to read in a prison where she languishes falsely accused of being a Christian, tip the scales. She is baptized, confirmed and takes the Eucharist in one ceremony in prison. Shortly thereafter she is brutally martyred. The story stands on its own feet. It is a great read independently of any external impact or uses.<br />But CALLISTA is also, in my opinion, the most illuminating first book which any serious or prospective student of ALL the works of John Henry Newman should read (or now re-read). For CALLISTA opens the door to Newman's spiritual autobiography of conversion, APOLOGIA PRO VITA SUA. It also adumbrates DEVELOPMENT OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE, RISE AND PROGRESS OF UNIVERSITIES, his sermons and Newman's many musings on the echo of God's voice definitively heard in conscience. And what CALLISTA does not lead into, Newman's earlier novel LOSS AND GAIN most certainly does lead into: ARIANS OF THE FOURTH CENTURY, THE IDEA OF A UNIVERSITY, A GRAMMAR OF ASSENT and literally every seriousthing the great Cardinal ever penned. Fortunately, the best edition of LOSS AND GAIN is by Alan G. Hill who gives us the best CALLISTA as well. <br />CALLISTA, perhaps the greatest of \\"Christian Romances,\\" indeed deserves to be read both internally for itself and also externally as a first step into the huge ocean of Newman's essays, poems (e.g. \\"Lead Kindly Light\\"), sermons, histories, satires, educational theory, philosophy, theology and more than 20,000 letters. CALLISTA, set in Africa, paradoxically invites readers to step into the almost as little known spiritual world of 19th Century England, one of the most creative times and places the world has yet known.<br />-OOO-	2002-09-19

This short novel is about a guilt driven man, his non-Christian religious order, his pet snake, three women associates, long contemplative patrols in space and a project to define and control time. <BR>***<BR>Kadmon had once led warriors onto a comet to dispossess malevolent invaders of his star system. He worked out a truce but then was recalled for consultations by a vaguely political, thinly omnipresent ruling body called  \\"The Order\\". Meanwhile the comet disappeared. Confused, Kadmon left the military and became a novice of  The Order. Much of his life was then spent aboard spacecraft making patrols. These assigned patrols taught novices techniques while testing their readiness to rise higher in The Order. Kadmon strove to understand time so that he could travel back in it and rescue his men from the comet.  <BR>***<BR>He was pledged to celibacy but was allowed by a curious Order to be tempted by three women who show him an outcropping on their home planet where time-related phenomena manifested themselves. Kadmon also carried everywhere a small, docile, pet serprent--whose skin color patterns had fascinated another woman in another time. During assigned patrol after patrol, some in the company of three women, Kadmon came closer to understanding time. Eventually he rescued his troops from the comet and evacuated their enemy as well. He had recollected at crucial moments the wisdom of Albert Einstein, Ignatius Loyola and the Jewish kabala. Kadmon and The Order also found connections linking time warps and black holes to Qumran, the Dead Sea Scrolls and Qumran's Teacher of Righteousness. <br />What's past is prologue. Kadmon and the woman Gelda made ready to accept The Order's final assignment to ride the comet back to radiation-sick, manhating mother Earth, to repopulate Earth's flora and fauna and replant the human race as well. The serpent, too, would play a role.  <br />In the novel's surprise ending author Lewis W. Green has us wondering what comes next. All we know for sure is the novel's leit motif: that what goes around, comes around--this time with ten times previous mass and velocity.  <br />This book is perhaps best understood by students of the Jewish kabala or freemasonry. Readers who prefer their science fiction mystical will also love THE  KABBALAH PILLARS. Loyal fans of Lewis Green will clamor for  their copies. As with his other novels, some fans may find this one on first reading tantalizingly complicated and baffling yet at the same time seducing into rewarding second and third re-reads <BR>. <BR>-OOO	2002-09-06

Friend of Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, friend of the great and powerful, and of the eccentric and the poor. <br />V.J. Matthews is a dull writer. But even he cannot mask the quirkiness, the good humor and the bubbling humanity of a holy man whom inhabitants of Rome have always held in high regard.<br />A good example: the last paragraph of the book:<br />&quot;On March 12, 1622, the jealous citizens of Rome were saying that that morning in S. Peter's the Pope--it was Gregory XV--had canonized 'four Spaniards and a Saint!' The &quot;Spaniards&quot; were Isadore the farmer of Madrid, Ignatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier and Teresa of Avila--no less. The &quot;Saint,' of course, was Rome's second Apostle, Philip Neri.&quot;<br />This is a useful short biography of the much neglected Saint whom John Henry Newman found so attractive that he introduced the Oratory of St Philip Neri to England in the late 1840s.	2002-09-06

Nineteenth Century England abounded in conversion novels and Newman's stands head and shoulders above all the rest. That, at least, was the opinion of Harvard history professor Robert Lee Wolff in his monumental 1977 GAINS AND LOSSES: NOVELS OF FAITH AND DOUBT IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND.<BR>...<BR>John Henry Newman (1801-1890) deserves a far wider non-specialist readership than he now enjoys. Once England hung on his every word: whether sermon, philosophy, church history, poetry, apologetics, satire or controversy. He does not lack for professional readers who take up formidable masterpieces such as APOLOGIA PRO VITA SUA, THE IDEA OF A UNIVERSITY, ARIANS OF THE FOURTH CENTURY or A GRAMMAR OF ASSENT.<BR>...<BR>LOSS AND GAIN may well be the easiest and best place for non-specialists to begin with myriad-minded John Henry Newman. It is a novel about Oxford and fleshes out Newman's belief that students form their deepest convictions from their discussions with one another and not from teachers. It is also a novel very much like a Platonic dialog that presents and wrestles with various theories of why intelligent young men are either content to stay with their inherited personal faith or are moved to seek another.<BR>...<BR>LOSS AND GAIN covers six years in the life of Charles Reding (pronounced READing) and his interactions with family, teachers, tutors and fellow students of various Oxford University colleges about which of the Christian denominations and trends in England of the 1840s had greatest claim to be taken seriously and to teach the truth. Problems debated are perennial since the Reformation: is there a visible church? Does it have authority to teach definitively? What is faith? What is reason's role in reaching faith? Who needs a Pope?<BR>...<BR>A tutor's systematic lectures on the 39 Articles of the established Church of England, interpreted by thehero as mere 16th Century \\"articles of peace,\\" a doctrinal hodgepodge of Roman Catholicism, Zwingli, Luther and Calvin, leaves an increasingly troubled Reding shaken in his inherited trust in his clergyman father's simple faith in the Church of England. Some of his Anglo-Catholic friends play at re-establishing Catholic practices without the Roman Catholic beliefs behind them. Others move towards rationalism and Unitarianism. Others yet are caught up in the emotional but action-oriented and society-transforming Evangelicalism of the age.<BR>...<BR>In the end Charles (like Newman after a 12 year struggle) opted to become Roman Catholic, thereby losing his right to take an Oxford degree, and alienating friends and family alike. He gained, he judged, truth and peace.<BR>...<BR>The debates of Oxford in the 1840s go on today in America and elsewhere. Recently converted himself to the Church of Rome, Newman pokes fun at the frequent shallowness and selfish career seeking that an Establishment of (the wrong) religion inevitably promotes. He also lovingly enlivens a bygone time at Oxford University where until very recently he had himself been the foremost leader of the Oxford Movement to reform the Church of England in a Catholic but non-Papal direction. Had he persuaded in TRACTS FOR THE TIMES # 90 even one Anglican bishop of the correctness of his Catholic interpretation of the 39 Articles, very likely neither Newman nor hundreds of others would have so suddenly gone over to Rome.<BR>...<BR>The book has color, humor, religious insight and respect for individual consciences. Charles Reding exemplifies Newman's belief that God leads each person of good will at an individual, unforced, respectful pace from his or her inherited religion toward ever closer union with Himself. He who first tastes Newman through reading LOSS AND GAIN will not be disappointed and will reach out for more and more of his works, both verse and prose.	2002-07-21

It is clear that generations of Russians and some  international scholars believe that there is probable evidence that the two men were one.

Author James Carroll was not previously known to me and that probably makes a difference. The dust jacket says that he has authored nine novels and a memoir, AN AMERICAN REQUIEM. The book has so much autobiographical detail in it that I wonder if Carroll, consciously or unconsciously, was writing for a claque of devoted followers. As spiritual autobiography, CONSTANTINE'S SWORD is not in a class with Augustine's CONFESSIONS or Newman's APOLOGIA PRO VITA SUA.<BR>***As history, it is superficial, virtually romping through its largely secondary sources. In areas with which I am more familiar, it seemed reasonably accurate, with one of several howlers being that the city of Cologne was once called Colonus. It was not.<BR>***As, I presume, some sort of half-Socratic device, the book asks, literally, hundreds and hundreds of questions: mostly unanswered. James Carroll's overriding question is why have so many Christians disliked or hated or even coerced or murdered so many Jews for so many centuries, One image of Carroll's that stays in the imagination is that Christianity and post-Christian Judaism are products of one religious womb but are Siamese twins whose separation was much more traumatic than it need have been. Leading Christians (starting with the author of John's Gospel, have over and over misconstrued Jews. They have defined Christianity against Jews who threaten the younger religion. Other more constructive paths were briefly trod by some Christians, e.g., Abelard and Cusanus. And those paths are worth revisiting by today's Christians and even broadening them and trying them once again.<br />***The book cries out for dialog, deeper probing and writing of better books on the subject of Christian wrongs to Jews. The subject is terribly important. The author's method, combining autobiography with history, group contrition and call for a new religious reformation and revival, is less thanstellar.	2002-07-08

Britain's turn would come and already the Church of England was shocked to find its ancient sources of revenues and its ability to manage its own affairs effectively challenged by a liberal and secularizing Parliament. The Oxford Movement (OM) was created in 1833 to reverse that trend. In the end it did far more. It also revitalized the Church of England both as a force for Gospel truth and for a sacramental view that everything in this world is a kind of language pointing to a higher, holy transcendent world which all men are invited to attain.<br />....<br />Historian Christopher Dawson's brief overview of the OM's first seven or eight years is masterly. It rewards repeated reading. First written a hundred years after the OM began, THE SPIRIT OF THE OXFORD MOVEMENT was almost unique in its day for flagging three facts.<br />----<br />The first fact is that the driving, almost demonic, force behind the Movement was the young Richard Hurrell Froude. Froude was the most gifted person whom John Henry Newman had ever met. Froude's unceasing nagging had the effect, over time, of removing every last one of John Henry Newman's inherited Protestant detestation of the Papacy. Without Froude, said Dawson, one could not have predicted that Newman would become a Roman Catholic Cardinal.<br />----<br />The second fact which Dawson convincingly and virtually uniquely among historians sketches is the impact of Calvinist theology on the young Newman. This theology John Henry imbibed from his Low Church Evangelistic parents and later at school from one or more teachers and from his reading in church history. Till the end of his days Newman, undisputed leader of the OM, firmly embraced Catholic views first learned under Calvinist auspices: the Majesty of God, the Incarnation and Predestination of the saints. As today's Baptists and Presbyterians become aware of Newman's abiding albeit critical Calvinism, they may join those Anglican/Episcopalians and Roman Catholics who see in the writings of Cardinal Newman a way to stitch up shattered Christian dogmatic unity. Newman is not normally presented as indebted to the thought of John Calvin or of the Geneva school of theology.<br />----<br />Thirdly, Dawson illustrates at work within the microcosm of the soul and conscience of Newman an evolution which Newman presented in THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE. There Newman argued that the one true form of orthodox Christianity, led by the Holy Spirit, will absorb all that is good in the world and cultures around it: Platonism, Aristotelianism, Protestantism, while rejecting what is untrue or harmful. Newman also believed that God gives each human person from birth the wherewithal to find Him, to transcend the limitations of his or her particular family or time in history, to respond to God's voice echoing in conscience and to find the true religion or at least move in its direction under guidance from the Holy Spirit.<br />----<br />Similarly, John Henry Newman himself is presented by Christopher Dawson as evolving towards God: reading the Bible as a youngster much as he read the Arabian Nights, then at 15 becoming and ever remaining a converted, pro-active Christian. This fervor endured for a time at Oxford but was challenged then fleshed out by Newman's flirtation with rationalism and liberalism. He then moved into High Church Anglicanism and its belief that it had added nothing to the faith of the Greek and Latin Fathers of the early church. Relentlessly Newman's conscience moved him toward Rome, fighting every step of the way. Finally, he converted to Roman Catholicism only when sadly convinced that he could no longer save his soul in the Church of England.<br />----<br />Dawson's  THE SPIRIT OF THE OXFORD MOVEMENT and its very brief supplement NEWMAN'S PLACE IN HISTORY are unlikely to be unsurpassed as short, brilliant introductions to Hurrell Froude, John Henry Newman and other giants of the early days of the Oxford Movement.giants of the early days of the Oxford Movement.	2002-01-21

He is one of quite a few who believe that the American Civil War could        have been shortened by two years had the Union but tenaciously        followed \\"the Anaconda plan\\" of its then commander-in-chief of the        army, General Winfield Scott.***  <br />       Teddy deftly or daftly (your call) at this moment of great peril summons        the now deaf octogenarian erstwhile Confederate General James        Longfield back into service of his country. The plot then leaps forward        with support from Longfield, Roosevelt and a supporting cast of        cabinet members and a young fictional hero, Major Patrick Mahan,        cousin of the great naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan. The Major's        earlier acquaintance with Kaiser Wilhelm and observation of German        military behavior in Peking during the Boxer rebellion are pressed into        service. By story's end Patrick is a general and bearer of the        Congressional Medal of Honor. He is married and about to run for        Congress.*** <br />       Despite 25,000 casualties the Americans have inflicted 40,000 on the        German invaders and prevailed in a massive naval engagement. The        Kaiser goes off to exile in Denmark. Subplots of romance, cross        cultural friendships and brutalities complicate a basically simple story        line. This is not a book to be read slowly or searching for metaphysical        significance. For the historian there are vignettes of German leaders        which lend some plausibility to the plot.	2001-06-26

And very good biography it is, of the &quot;life and times variety.&quot; Joe Sanders was 14 in 1909 when a driver stopped the first car (a 1904 Oldsmobile) he had ever seen in front of his family's farm outside Ottoville in northwestern Ohio. That day began a lifelong romance with automobiling. A few years later, having had first typhoid fever and then pneumonia, young Joe followed his doctor's advice and went south for his health. After a few months in the seat of Comal County, Texas, New Braunfels, he enlisted in the army for World War I. Once mustered out, he returned to New Braunfels and went to work for decades as a chauffeur and mechanic for the wealthy German-American Hippolyt Dittlinger. He married the author's grandmother and began exploring by car and on foot the nearby limestone Hill Country above New Braunfels.<br />---The author sets her grandfather's life and achievements against times when the automobile was new, the Hill Country was still wild and woolly, tourism was just starting up and unwary travelers frequently got lost for lack of any signs on the back roads indicating where they were or how far from the next town. Joe Sanders made it a personal mission to help stranded tourists. He enlisted others to help him place sign posts throughout the back country. Between 1933 and 1960 he compiled data for a series of accurate, increasingly detailed and colorful maps of Comal County and the sights no visitor should miss. These included sweeping mountain vistas, caverns, rivers, streams, ranches, wildlife and on and on. He also took hundreds of photographs converted by himself and friends into postcards to attract more tourists to the Hill Country.<br />--The well researhed book sketches the evolution of American motoring, tourism, techniques for building roads and the benefits maps can bring to a community eager to make itself known. A simple story of American caring and getting things done.mmunity eager to make itself known. A simple story of American caring and getting things done.	2001-04-07

GRASSROOTS WOMEN is primarily about Texas and Texans but also has something for all Americans in love with politics. For example, Republican women interviewed by the author tell of supporting through doubts and disappointments Senator John Tower, Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon and other politicians.  Campaign strategists of any party can harvest winning tips about fund raising, telephone polling, selecting great candidates and running campaigns from women who were there and did these things, including Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Ambassador Ann Armstrong.<br />--Sociologists will find raw material about the struggle for equal status with men. For decades the most Republican women could hope for was to be invited to serve as the sometimes barely tolerated Deputy Chairmen of long entrenched males. Winning Co-Chairman status was not easy. Feminists will note little signs of emerging personal identities not derivative from one's husband. Thus, one and the same person served as G.O. P. National Committeewoman for Texas from 1982 to 1999. She is recorded in 82-83 as Mrs. H. E. Chiles, Mrs. Fran Chiles in 84-85, and just plain Fran Chiles in 86-87. (See list, p. 506.)<br />--Texas women could not even sit on juries before 1954. Glass ceilings were everywhere. Republicans first empowered themselves through political clubs for women before they moved up to party positions like precinct chairmen. They campaigned for favored candidates with their babies in their arms. Without active Republican women, GRASSROOTS WOMEN suggests, Texas might still be a majority Democratic Party state, though notably more conservative than the national Democratic party of Senator Ted Kennedy.	2001-03-18

Books about him and his family continue to pour out. It is a pity, therefore, that PEACEMAKING 1919 is not still readily available to readers.  --In November 1918 at the time of the armistice, Nicolson was a passionate Wilsonian. Within four months, at the Paris peace conference, he was thoroughly disillusioned. Wilson had too quickly made territorial concessions to Italy, contrary to the principles of the very Fourteen Points which had made a Wilsonian of Harold Nicolson. And the American idol would fall farther and faster thereafter. --Woodrow Wilson rendered more and ever more to Caesar while asserting that he was doing the work of God and the American people. Nor was Wilson the only sanctimonious hypocrite among the leaders of the  Allied and Associated Powers at Paris. --Nicolson's diaries and reflections convey, as he intends to convey, the sense that the peace made at Paris to end World War I was the product of poor planning, disorganized diplomacy, growing fatigue and a very large disconnect between experts and decision-makers. --PEACEMAKING 1919 was written as a manual for young British diplomatists who would face future peace conferences. If they heeded Nicolson, they would then be in a position to avoid the disaster known as the Treaty of Versailles.

A principal literary technique the author  uses is to contrast various players: politicians Gorbachev and Yeltsin or Generals Lebed and Grachev, for example. Klebnikov presents no more striking Russian \\"parallel lives\\"  than those of oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky.<br />     Mikhail Gorbachev seems a passably decent, honorable  man in the pages of GODFATHER OF THE KREMLIN.  Paul Klebnikov's pageant locates, however, almost all his other  players at various positions on a wide scale of sheer  criminality, venality, murderousness and self-seeking. On that scale Gusinsky is comparatively (and only comparatively) a good guy, while Berezovsky wears a black hat.<br />     Yet the parallels are striking, with the implication that for a time Godfather Berezovsky played \\"me, too\\" or \\"catch up\\" to Gusinsky. In 1989 Gusinsky partnered with an American, Berezovksy with an Italian. In 1991 Gusinsky established Most Bank, Berezovsky started one, too. Both went after an Aeroflot account. Both reached out for newspapers and TV networks.<br />     But there was one big difference. \\"In contrast to Berezovsky, who liked to take over existing enterprises, Gusinsky created entirely new companies. He  added value to the Russian economy. ... Unlike Berezovsky, Gusinsky could legitimately claim to have played a constructive role in the Russian economy\\" (p. 148f).<br />     Absent good government and a moral business culture in Russia, Berezovsky and most if not all the other oligarchs found sheer piracy and looting of wealth created by others the easiest way to grow personally rich. Neither Berezovsky nor Gusinsky is remotely as benign or constructive as America's so-called \\"robber barons\\" such as Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie and Morgan (who were neither criminals norlooters). But in a brilliant tour d'horizon of Russian society sketched in the author's  Epilogue at pp. 322--326, Boris Berezovksy comes across as both criminal and looter, while Vladimir Gusinsky seems merely criminal. Is it possible that the best that can be hoped for of private Russian business in the next decade is that the Berezevskys will decrease while the Gusinskys will increase? Will both dreadful types ultimately be replaced by hard driving but morally upright businessmen more like Steve Jobs, Ross Perot or Don Rumsfeld? -OOO-	2001-01-14

One life always dominates but others are ready to leap out and bite. Grinding along in any of his lives--journalist, politician, researcher, polymath, crusader, etc., he is easy to predict. What remains unfathomable, however, is the timing of when he will switch lives. What comes next? Look to his genes and his rearing.<br />In THE PRINCE OF TENNESSEE: THE RISE OF AL GORE, our Vice President grows relentlessly. The book (Simon and Schuster, 2000) is by Clinton biographer David Maraniss, aided by Washington Post staffer Ellen Nakashima.<br />Maraniss makes it clear where &quot;I'll Fight for You!&quot; comes from, especially the fighting. And the hatred of losing.<br />Take sports. While his father was Senator in Washington, young Al spent nine years in St Alban's school. He took art as an elective and was a good, imaginative painter. There he once asked a teacher, &quot;Sir, is this the time to be rowdy?&quot; (p. 45). Born in 1948 and for years a bit of a runt, suddenly in the summer of 1960 he became &quot;a husky young man&quot; (p. 52). Captain of St Alban's football team, he felt that his lackadaisical teammates were causing him to lose. So he told the coach they were breaking training. In basketball, Gore was &quot;an incorrigible if deadly gunner from the left corner.&quot; A teammate remembered that &quot;his goal seemed to be to score as many points as possible in order to get his name in the paper&quot; (p. 56). He was a little slow and not much of a jumper, but tenacious. Relegated to the varsity bench at Harvard, on the few occasions when he did play, he was so competitive that he invariably threw elbows and was in foul trouble within minutes (p. 71). In the mid '70s as a freshman Congressman, Al Gore played pickup basketball in the House gym. He &quot;fired from the corner, a long-range gunner who passed only if necessary&quot; (p. 182). Does this help understand some of his tactics in the 2000 Presidential debates?<br />David Maraniss's book unsparingly traces the evolution of Gore's weaknesses: his stoic, machine-like woodenness as a speaker, mediocre grades in formal education, smoking far more dope and for more years than he ever admitted, constantly putting himself into competitions where he was good but never best (football, basketball, defense policy, Presidential campaigning) and a sad, profound loneliness and inability to make close friends.<br />But THE PRINCE OF TENNESSEE also has his strengths: discipline which gets results, passion for facts, a quick study, an inability to be bored, a passion to try to explain the complex to the uneducated, e.g. global warming, detestation of racism and a shy personal outreach to black people. He had it all from the beginning.<br />What will Al Gore do now? He once promised Tipper to buy and run a small country newspaper. Daughter Karenna thinks he might become an astronaut. He will try something honorable and be good at it, but probably never be the very best.	2000-12-23

It dashes angrily across too many topics: contraception, abortion,  a celibate priesthood, the role of Catholics in the Holocaust, freedom of  expression and on and on.<br />Professor Wills complains that the Roman  Catholic church has become needlessly over centralized and administered top  down. This makes the church too prone to the book's  subtitle,  &quot;structures of deceit.&quot; These structures predispose clerical  leaders to mislead rather than admit that the church has been seriously  wrong at any time on any issue.<br />Wills does, nonetheless, identify  individuals who stood out against boneheaded errors by top officials and  who were later judged correct by the consensus of the faithful. The list of  heroic deeds begins with Paul publicly rebuking Peter in Antioch for  backsliding on what Jewish practices pagan converts to Christianity must  practice (Galatians 2: 11-14). St Augustine of Hippo took on St Jerome of  Jerusalem over this very passage. In 1870 Lord Acton, John Henry Newman and  many bishops were appalled by Pope Pius IX's deceptive and dishonest  tactics promoting papal infallibility .<br />Garry Wills argues that the  entire Church must follow Jesus who is Truth and be led by a Holy Spirit  breathing the New Testament Greek grace of parrhesia: etymologically   &quot;pan-rhesia&quot; or &quot;speak all,&quot; i.e., &quot;holding  nothing back.&quot; For spiritual sins are vastly worse than bodily: lying  more soul-killing than fornication.<br />In moral situations the church should  stop teaching with false precision when solutions are not apparent, notably  in key areas of sexuality. Wills offers the following principle from  Epistle 190 of St Augustine:<br />&quot;When a thing obscure in itself defeats  our capacity, and nothing in Scripture comes to our aid, it is not safe for  humans to presume they can pronounce on it.&quot;<br />Both Augustine and  Newman fought for a church in which God speaks to everyone: clergy and  laity alike. Our knowledge is always provisional, in unceasing outreach for  ultimate truth.	2000-07-18

He has two sons: Frank, the older a State Senator, and Scott, an unintentional matricide (lost control of his car while driving through a snowstorm to buy alcohol for the holidays).  <br />    Understandably depressed by this event, as also by his  his father's perceived lack of love, Scott receives in advance part of his inheritance, then wades into a life of mental hospitals and evil companions. He settles at age 40 as an American expatriate on Mexico's east coast.  There he half-heartedly pursues his erstwhile profession (painting) while sinking ever deeper  into drugs, sex and dependence on his true love, Renata.  <br />    With a Winchester twelve-gauge shotgun, a recent Christmas gift from older brother Frank, Scott takes his life in Mexico.  Or does he?  Atticus arrives, interacts with Scott's colorful circle of friends and acquaintances.  He pieces together conflicting facts until he virtually compels a happy ending (for the moment) to this clever detective story in an exotic setting of tropical beaches and Mayan ruins (Scott lives atop one, reminiscent of the young James Joyce's tower in Dublin).  Just before Atticus's happiness becomes complete, &quot;The governor appointed him to a fish and game board...and he was re-elected to the parish council at St. Mary's&quot;--in Antelope County, it goes without saying.  <br />    There are enough themes here for four novels.

Ten-year old Justin hires the meanest lawyer on television to prevent his parents from divorcing not just themselves but him, too.  &quot;Divorced children&quot; at his school share strategies for lessening pain.  Justin's parents, successful yuppies, love Justin and work reasonably well together to do the same things for him after divorce as before.  But the parents love their jointly designed Ne Hampshire home at least as much as they do Justin, and he senses this.  He constructs a box home for his pet worm: an act variously accounted for by a psychiatrist, lawyers and judges.  In juvenile court the point is made that, in divorcing each other, the parents are ruining Justin's life.  This argument complicates parallel proceedings in divorce court.  Justin's lawyer, cynical, hardboiled foe of marriage and all its works, Boston-based Weld Pennyworth works with a cast of male and female judges and lawyers to give Justin power over his parents.  The divorced kids at Justin's school form and promote on TV  &quot;N.O.K.&quot;,the National Organization of Kids, to promote kids' rights.  Through working with another court-appointed guardian ad litem, Pennyworth unblocks memories of his own &quot;divorce&quot; at age eight and probes new dimensions of love, marriage and fidelity.  As he had recommended to his young client, lawyer Pennyworth becomes &quot;fearless.&quot;       Richard Frede uses divorce as the setting of a tautly crafted morality play which explores &quot;children's rights.&quot;  Don't be surprised if you read the book straight through at one sitting.  The story moves rapidly and does not overwhelm with lawyerly detail about grey areas of child law, courtroom procedure and the quaint and quirky mores of lawyers.  Make a leap of faith that parents can be vastly less mature than their ten year old child and that they can place personal pride and love of possessions above their son's welfare and the surprising climax follows inexorably from the premises.	1996-08-18
