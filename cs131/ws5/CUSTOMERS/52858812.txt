Everyone Should Have a Copy.	\\"The Pocket Book of Patriotism\\" is a beautifully presented little book containing many of the \\"essentials\\" that every American child and adult should become familiar with. I say \\"little\\" because it only has 96 pages; yet those pages are full of information that, if taken to heart, ought to make we Americans proud. What a resource to have readily available in a format that can be carried in a backpack, brief case, purse, or even a child's lunch box! Jonathan Foreman, the man who put this valuable contribution together, describes the book (better than I can) in his Introduction: <br />  <br />\\"It is not a textbook, still less an encyclopedia. It is a celebration of this country. Without whitewashing America's past (true patriotism acknowledges America's sins and flaws) it celebrates America's history, her contributions to humanity, the eternal optimism and energy of her people. Above all it celebrates the documents in which successive generations of Americans have placed their faith.\\" <br />  <br />And that's exactly what it does and what it delivers. In my view, this \\"little\\" book should be placed in the hands of every American schoolchild, not to be \\"read\\" as one would a novel or ordinary nonfiction book, but to be perused occasionally for thoughtful reflection and accessible for immediate reference when one needs the information contained therein. So, what is \\"contained therein\\"? Here, briefly, is a list of some of the contents: <br />  <br />1. A selective timeline of historic events (beginning in 30,000 B.C.! and continuing until 2005 A.D.). Also, little-known facts which place America's chronology in the context of key world events, interspersed with fascinating quotes by important figures. <br />  <br />Incidentally, I am happy to relate that one of my favorite quotes is included: the famous (to some \\"infamous\\") statement that Barry Goldwater made during his presidential bid that got virtually all Democrat and many Republican noses out of joint. However, Goldwater was correct then and subsequent history has, I think, shown him to be correct. (Sorry, you'll have to read the book to see what quotation I'm referencing.) <br />  <br />2. Excerpts from key speeches, charters, and significant documents of American history, with highlights from the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. <br />  <br />Every American, at the very least, ought to be familiar with the first paragraph and the first sentence of the third paragraph of the Declaration of Independence. Furthermore, I would think it desirable that every American child be able to recite the Preamble to the Constitution. I have found that many Americans can't even recognize its placement among our core documents. That's a shame. <br />  <br />3. Excerpts and lyrics from classic patriotic songs and poems. <br />  <br />It is an unfortunate fact that our public schools have virtually ignored or forgotten the famous songs and poems of America and no longer expose students to them. The author has included a few favorites of mine -- Emerson's \\"The Concord Hymn,\\" Longfellow's \\"Paul Revere's Ride,\\" and \\"The Marine Corps Hymn\\" among them -- and I would hope that our young people would become familiar with them and the others offered. They are, after all, an essential part of our American heritage. <br />  <br />4. Chronological lists of US presidents as well as the states and their dates of accession to the Union. <br />  <br />I used to teach American history many eons ago. In my first year of teaching I required my students to memorize the names of the US presidents in chronological order; until, that is, one of my students asked \\"why\\" when they could simply \\"look them up.\\" Good question! I stopped that practice immediately and spent the time showing my students where to find the information when they needed it. Now I would simply put this book in their hands and tell them to keep it handy all the time. <br />  <br />5. A history of the Medal of Honor and other medals of valor. <br />  <br />This is an unusual (albeit very valuable) entry in my opinion. Most American history textbooks do not seem to contain this type of information. Hats off to the author for including it as a part of our American heritage. Our children especially need to be made aware of the part our military veterans have played in keeping our nation free. The Medal of Honor winners are true heroes, as are those who have won other medals for bravery and service. <br />  <br />6. A primer on US flag traditions and etiquette. <br />  <br />Again, valuable information in this day and age when so many Americans do not seem to be aware that a certain respect is due our flag; not because of the flag itself, but because it is a symbol reflecting our commitment to liberty and justice for all. It is unfortunate that so often our flag is seen as a symbol of mere political policies rather than which it truly represents. <br />  <br />All in all, I think Foreman has made a splendid contribution to the citizens of this country, both young and old, by putting together this resource and providing us with a true sense of what \\"patriotism\\" genuinely means. All too often these days, we are presented with a cheap \\"nickel and dime\\" patriotism or a hubristic \\"nationalistic\\" patriotism which results in mere xenophobia or in a misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the American adventure. Our Founding Fathers would have rejected both notions of such patriotism, opting instead for a patriotism which articulated those ideas and ideals expressed in the two key documents of American history: the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States (notably the Preamble). <br />  <br />I highly recommend this book and hope for its wide distribution. We must regain a sense of \\"civic pride\\" in its true and rational meaning, especially in this time when we face so many challenges, both domestic and foreign. In order to accomplish this, in my view, we need to have at hand sucha book as this to remind us that, while we are not perfect by any means, we are dedicated to the ideas and ideals upon which America was founded.	2005-09-30

September 11th, the worst terrorist attack in American history, and the current international war on terrorism have changed the lives of people around the globe. The search for the accused masterminds behind 9/11 and other recent attacks against Western and Western-allied targets, and the pursuit of those who are the direct perpetrators of terrorist activities, is an ongoing and very expensive enterprise. <br />  <br />Of particular interest are the whereabouts and capture of Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri, leaders of the terrorist group called Al Qaeda. For the most part, Al Qaeda has been characterized as an Islamist front united in armed struggle, or \\"jihad,\\" against Western civilization and Western interests. But Fawaz A. Gerges, a noted historian and Middle East expert, has a different take on the matter and has offered his own analysis in \\"The Far Enemy,\\" a book that is extremely detailed and meticulously researched. <br />  <br />Gerges certainly possesses the credentials needed to write a book such as this. Educated at Oxford University and the London School of Economics, he has previously been a Research Fellow at Harvard and Princeton universities, and he now holds the Christian A. Johnson Chair in International Affairs and Middle Eastern Studies at Sarah Lawrence College. Gerges has written widely on Arab and Muslim politics, Islamist movements, American foreign policy, and relations between the world of Islam and the West. His has authored several books and his articles have appeared in several of the most respected journals and newspapers in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. He is also a senior analyst and regular commentator for ABC television news on Middle Eastern affairs. <br />  <br />The first question that naturally comes to one's mind is: What is meant by the \\"Far Enemy\\"? Furthermore, if there is a \\"far enemy,\\" there should be a \\"near enemy\\" and who is that? I have read a great deal about Islam and the Islamic \\"jihad\\" during the past few years and never came across these terms before. Now that I am familiar with them, thanks to the author, past and current events regarding Islamic-Western tensions, and some of the events in certain Muslim-dominated nations, are better understood. To put it simply, the \\"far enemy\\" refers to the United States and its Western allies; the \\"near enemy\\" are the Muslim regimes which have been deemed \\"unacceptable\\" either for their secularization of politics and society or because, in the view of some jihadists, the religious authorities and scholars have been \\"subverted by corrupting Western influences.\\" <br />  <br />Up until the late 1990s, according to the author, jihadists had concentrated their attention on fighting the \\"near enemy,\\" that is, bringing about political and social change within Muslim nations, returning these nations to their essential Islamic religious foundation. Then, as the twenty-first century approached, some jihadists internationalized the battle and the \\"far enemy\\" became the focus of the struggle. This is the situation regarding Al Qaeda. Gerges argues that Al Qaeda is actually a minority within the jihadist movement. Moreover, it has been criticized and opposed by other jihadists, namely the religious nationalists who want to focus on changing the Muslim world rather than internationalizing the battle. These latter want to confront and change the \\"near enemy\\" and not fight the \\"far enemy.\\" <br />  <br />One example of the above will be related here. Referring to Nageh Abdullah Ibrahim, a major theoretician of the jihadist organization called the Islamic Group who is currently serving a life sentence in Egypt, Gerges states: \\"...Ibrahim and other imprisoned Islamic Group leaders fault Al Qaeda for ignoring reality and living in itsown bubble. They go after bin Laden with a vengeance, accusing him of shutting his eyes and ears and blindly plunging forward, bringing the temple down on his own head the ummah's as well.\\" <br />  <br />Gerges continues: \\"Ibrahim says that had bin Laden paid adequate attention to his humble capabilities, he would have refrained from declaring war on the world, but the issue is bigger than that because bin Laden has lost touch with reality, rationality, and religious precepts. As a result, Ibrahim adds, Al Qaeda caused the downfall of two Muslim regimes -- in Kabul and Baghdad -- and Arab states have faced the brunt of the American armada. In short, Al Qaeda is no longer an intact, cohesive organization because it confuses myth with fact and entertains strange ideas. Ibrahim compares Al Qaeda with the Saddam Hussein regime and implies that bin Laden could bring about the destruction of his network like Hussein did to the Iraqi state.\\" <br />  <br />Those who think that the jihadists constitute a unified movement in complete agreement about who is the real adversary and the strategies to be employed in defeating it are in error, according to Gerges. This whole issue is far more complex than most Western observers think. There has been a rift, largely ignored by the West, between those Islamic jihadists who are interested in promoting global terrorism, going after the \\"far enemy,\\" and those who want to concentrate on the \\"near enemy.\\" This rift, says Gerges, led to the events of September 11 and has dominated developments ever since. <br />  <br />According to Gerges, the West must understand this: \\"...the war against transnationalist jihadis cannot be won on the battlefield in either Afghanistan or Iraq; this is not a conventional war in which two armies confront each other and emerge victorious or vanquished. One of the arguments advanced in the book is that the most effective means to put Al Qaeda out of business is to complete its encirclement and siege internally; there is overwhelming evidence pointing in that direction: bin Laden and his associates have lost the war for Muslim minds.\\" <br />  <br />This is a very complex, detailed work based on firsthand field research, interviews, primary documents, and letters. Not, however, your leisure-time reading.	2005-09-25

Like all males, I have interacted with the opposite sex all my life and merely chalked up the personality-bound dissimilarities between us as the result of socio-cultural influences and the ways in which we were individually treated. Physiological research into the variances between the sexes, other than the visible ones, was not a subject much emphasized nor much discussed. How times have changed! Brain studies, with investigations into the chemistry of hormones, proteins, and the like, plus the explosion of knowledge about genes and their influence on human physiology and behavior, have provided us with new and fascinating insights into the fundamental asymmetries which exist between men and women, regardless of the environment in which they were raised. <br />  <br />In her new book, \\"Why Men Never Remember and Women Never Forget,\\" Dr. Marianne Legato has summarized much of the recent research and used the results to offer a very practical guide for ordinary men and women to use in evaluating gender relationships and for understanding the psychological and social differences between the sexes, based on the biology involved, with the hope that such awareness will help avoid many of the difficulties that occur within marriages, friendships, and other types of associations. And she does all this while entertaining the reader with interesting anecdotes and sidebars, using an easy writing style which is pleasing to both the mind and the eye. This is quite an achievement in a book which contains much technical information gleaned from recent scientific studies within the disciplines of medicine, physiology, biology, and such. <br />  <br />She begins her book with an interesting \\"true and false\\" feature. \\"True or false: Sex is determined by our biology.\\" Do you know the correct answer? \\"True or false: There are significant differences between the brains of men and women.\\" The answer may surprise you! \\"True or False: The brain has a sex at birth.\\" Some people may be surprised here also. \\"True or False: Men's brains are bigger.\\" Never thought about this topic before, but now I have; is it true or false? This is just a sampling of the \\"true and false\\" feature she has in the first chapter; some of the other topics she tackles are just as provocative and are sure to raise the hackles of some members of both sexes. But, after all, \\"truth\\" is truth, and sometimes a bitter pill. Political correctness has no place in the natural and physical sciences. <br />  <br />Chapter Two is devoted to the question: \\"What attracts us to one another and how do we fall in love?\\" Having been in love many times myself (on various levels, of course!), I often wondered what provided the \\"essential key\\" to falling in love with a particular person while ignoring another person even though similar in many ways. Well (and please don't let this information dampen your romantic relationships!), a lot of it has to do with chemistry and your brain. Many of us have said over the years, mostly with tongue in cheek: \\"I guess the 'chemistry' between us is just right and that's why we fell in love.\\" Now we can take someone seriously who says that because, in fact, there is scientific evidence supporting such a statement. We weren't wrong after all. We just didn't know why we were right! <br />  <br />Virtually all of us have noticed, I think, that there's often a communication problem between the sexes. Women complain that men just don't listen to them and don't respond in the way desired. Men complain that women are always dredging something up from the past that isn't important anymore. And so it goes. Dr. Legato discusses, in the third chapter, this matter of listening, hearing, and remembering. Yes, there appears to be a biological explanation for differences in the way men and women communicate. The reader will be fascinated with the findings, and the author provides, in Chapter Four, some helpful guidelines for diffusing and preventing communication problems between the sexes (\\"Legato's Laws\\"). <br />  <br />In Chapters Five and Six, the author discusses marriage, family, and parenthood. Stress and depression are the subjects of Chapters Seven and Eight and, yes, there are differences in the way women and men react to stress, and depression has differing gender characteristics. The final chapter turned out to be of specific interest to me since it deals with men, women, and aging (I am approaching still another birthday). The title of this chapter, \\"Where Did I Leave My Keys?,\\" could have well applied to me a few months ago when, indeed, I lost my keys and didn't know where I lost them (left them in my post office box). But the fact is, I am finding myself not as sharp in the memory department as I was when younger. As Dr. Legato points out, and few of us seem to think about, our brains are aging right along with the rest of our body. She says she also has to pay more attention to where she puts her own keys now, \\"so I won't spend 15 minutes looking for them the next morning.\\" I can relate to that. <br />  <br />In conclusion, I can say, without any reservations, that this book is an excellent read. I can't think of a person who won't benefit from the information contained within and the helpful guidelines and recommendations the author provides. Admittedly, I am biased in favor of works which translate contemporary scientific research into useful information for ordinary readers. After all, of what good is science if it doesn't help us live better lives? As one critic has stated: \\"Reading this book is a total 'aha' experience from start to finish.\\" I couldn't agree more.	2005-09-04
US	52858812	R1E2X2YJGOWFT	0974542725	37980116	Alter Your Life: Overbooked? Overworked? Overwhelmed?	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A Lot of Very Practical Suggestions...	There is little question, it seems to me, that most Americans living in this new century of ours are suffering from a condition one might refer to as the \\"stressed-out\\" syndrome. (And the really unfortunate thing is that this is true of young people as well, some of them barely into their teenage years.) Many of us are working harder, trying to raise families while advancing a career, competing obsessively in the marketplace for that promotion, striving to keep up with the Jones next door, hoping that the pay check will last until the end of the month, and, well, you get the point. Are we simply condemned to this malady by the realities of modern life, or is there a way of successfully meeting this challenge and conquering it? Dr. Kathleen Hall, the author of this book and one of our nation's leading authorities on stress management, thinks there is and she calls it \\"living an intentional life.\\" <br /> <br />This is a self-help book, to be sure. Many of you probably think as I do: most self-help books are so full of psycho-babble, unrealistic expectations, impractical advice, dogmatic prescriptions, and are so far out of touch with the actual world in which most of us live, that they seem to be written only to make some quick money for the author. I assure you this is not the case with Dr. Hall's book. Believe me, I look hard for incidences of psycho-babble in self-help books (it's one of my pet peeves) and I could not find a single case of it here. In sum, she has outlined a simple, easy-to-read, very practical and, above all, undogmatic, blueprint for living an intentional life. <br /> <br />The \\"intentional\\" life, Dr. Hall says, has three simple ingredients: awareness, choice, and energy. These are not sequential; it is simply necessary to \\"become aware of these three key elements in your life and learn how to navigate them.\\" She emphasizes that we ought to look at our daily experiences, listen to what our body and mind are telling us, and become more conscious of how we are living our lives and how we want to live them. If I could put this general prescription into my own words, I would say she is proposing living a \\"proactive\\" life as opposed to a \\"reactive\\" life, and most people do seem to mostly \\"react\\" to the situations they encounter in life rather than make a proactive choice. <br /> <br />There is absolutely nothing complex about the prescriptions in this book regarding how to live an intentional life. Above all, they are very down-to-earth; very much a matter of applied \\"common sense.\\" It is simply that so many people, if not the majority in today's hectic world, either \\"forget\\" to pay attention to these simple ideas or are stressed out and distracted by the events surrounding them. The author here is really recommending that we all need, now and then, to \\"stop and smell the roses,\\" so to speak. <br /> <br />But, of course, there is much more than that presented. She gets down to the \\"nitty-gritty,\\" shall we say, and, chapter by chapter, discusses everything from making your morning shower an event for setting the stage for your day, suggesting gardening (even though you may have to plant a \\"mini-garden\\" in your bathroom) as a means of reclaiming your roots to the soil, altering your dinner experience at home so you have \\"dined well,\\" and, yes, even how to turn dishwashing into a unique and fulfilling experience. To point out the range of \\"ordinary\\" daily experiences she discusses, just let me say that Chapter One is entitled \\"Waking Up\\" and Chapter Twenty-four is entitled \\"Sleeping.\\" Between those two points of reference are chapters devoted to most of the other daily activities we perform and encounters we experience (breakfast, commuting, working, leisure, family, etc.). Furthermore, most chapters end with a suggestion as to how to \\"alter your life\\" in the area discussed. <br /> <br />What I like most about Dr. Hall's book is that it is sound, pragmatic, and undogmatic. It deals with the simple pleasures we canexperience in our lives, if only we would pay attention to them rather than ignore them or get distracted by other things which contribute to our \\"stressed-out\\" syndrome. Since I am by education, inclination, and choice, a philosopher in the formal sense (and an Aristotelian realist, at that!), let me conclude with a more philosophical observation. <br /> <br />Aristotle's famous work, the \\"Nicomachean Ethics,\\" was written to provide us with a blueprint for living \\"a life worth living.\\" His book is, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, the only sound, pragmatic, and undogmatic work in moral philosophy within the Western tradition of intellectual thought. I have used those same words (sound, pragmatic, undogmatic) to describe Dr. Hall's \\"Alter Your Life.\\" I think this is justified. Furthermore, I suspect that Aristotle, if he were living today, would also approve of her work; he was, after all, that most practical and commonsensical of philosophers. His \\"Ethics\\" was a manual on how to put together a \\"good life\\" through the practice of the virtues; hers is a manual on how to deal with the stresses of this contemporary world or, if you will, how to live a \\"good life\\" through the practice of intentional living in spite of the stresses surrounding us. I think Aristotle and Dr. Hall would have gotten along famously. <br /> <br />I recommend this book and my fellow males should not shy away from reading this book. After all, women on the average live longer than we males do, and it may be (at least partially) because they are willing to seek help and guidance rather than face stressful conditions alone. I know men tend to avoid self-help books because they consider them to be \\"for women.\\" This is unfortunate. Men also need to learn strategies, even the simple ones suggested in this book, in order to live a healthy and meaningful life.	2005-08-31
US	52858812	R1CZF1RUQ1TE63	0805078681	354954174	Squandered Victory: The American Occupation and the Bungled Effort to Bring Democracy to Iraq	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Regardless of what some critics say, this book is worth reading...	\\"Squandered Victory\\" is, I submit, a book which will have wide appeal to those who are intellectually interested in America's recent intrusion into Iraq, its justification for that intrusion, and its problem with \\"building a peace\\" after defeating the Iraqi military, bringing down Saddam Hussein, and occupying the country. The general reader, however, may run into difficulty handling the depth of detail that Larry Diamond provides and upon which he bases his evaluation of the current Iraq situation and his recommendations for establishing a stable and prosperous Iraq in the future. Therefore, I suggest that the general reader may be better served by reading the Introduction and then Chapters 1 and 2, followed by reading the last two chapters (10 and 11), before tackling the other chapters in the book. I don't often recommend this procedure but, in this particular case, I'm afraid the ordinary reader may get bogged down amongst the \\"trees,\\" and fail to complete a reading of the book, thereby missing the \\"forest.\\" <br />  <br />Diamond's book is steeped in detail. And rightly so. But his conclusions (Chapters 10 and 11) should not be ignored and, indeed, in my opinion, constitute the most important part of the entire work. The author is eminently qualified to draw the conclusions he does, criticizing the policies and practices of the American occupation, pointing out what went wrong, and suggesting possibilities for making things right. He certainly has the proper credentials: senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, well-respected political scientist and sociologist, academic position at Stanford University; and the appropriate experience: an activist expert and lecturer on democratic institutions, coeditor of the \\"Journal of Democracy,\\" and, of course, serving as a senior advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in Iraq, this latter position providing the experience which forms the basis for what he has to say in \\"Squandered Victory.\\" <br />  <br />It was Dr. Condoleezza Rice who asked Professor Diamond to go to Iraq as an advisor to the CPA. In January of 2004 he arrived in Baghdad and worked inside the now famous (infamous to some) \\"Green Zone\\" until April of that year. He experienced firsthand the frustrations, the fears, the angers, the ups and downs, the hopes and disappointments, not only of his fellow coworkers in the CPA, but of the Iraqi people as well. Diamond's accounts of his personal experiences while in Iraq are secondary to the main intent of the book, but he relates them in a vivid exposition of the dangers and frustrations of daily living within what was and still is a war zone ((I mean, how would you feel about going out for a pizza, realizing you were risking your life in the process?). <br />  <br />The author was not a supporter of the war in Iraq; he makes that announcement at the outset. He felt, however, that since the war and occupation were now realities and the Saddam Hussein had been overthrown, and being, if my interpretation of his position is correct, a pragmatist when it comes to political affairs (as I am), then, if he could help in building a democratic Iraq, he would do so. What he discovered, once he was working within the CPA, was a series of blunders, miscalculations, and missed opportunities on the part of the American occupation authority in dealing with the actual situation. Many of those who were in positions of authority and advisement are severely criticized by Diamond, including CPA Administrator L. Paul Bremer who, if Diamond is correct, was simply not prepared for the task at hand and had no clear plan as to what to do to establish a democratic government in the country. <br />  <br />Obviously the United States \\"won\\" the war on the ground. But I think, considering the overwhelming capabilities of the U.S. military, that was a given. We could literally destroy any country on the face of the earth if we wanted to. The problem, however, as I think Diamond clearly pointsout, is \\"making\\" the peace on the ground. This has not been done and, it appears, may not be done for many years. \\"Squandered Victory\\" provides plenty of evidence as to why this is the case. It exposes both the naivet and the premature optimism of the Bush administration in deciding to invade Iraq and \\"impose\\" a democratic form of governance on a country which had no tradition of democracy and little understanding of it. It also seems, if I'm interpreting the author's presentation correctly, that there has been little opportunity to actually present the fundamentals of a democratic sociopolitical organization to the Iraqi people themselves (who, after all, wants to conduct seminars, workshops, or give lectures while being shot at or at risk for roadside bombs?). <br />  <br />Professor Diamond does appear to remain somewhat positive about bringing democracy to Iraq, provided certain changes in policy are made and implemented. I have to part company with him at this point. I am not at all optimistic about success in Iraq, despite the author's take on the matter. My considered opinion, for what it's worth, is that Iraq may likely become Bush's Vietnam. I sincerely hope I am wrong. But, if we should have learned anything from the hard experience of our previous military misadventures in the latter half of the twentieth century, it is this: We may \\"win\\" a military victory over any army that dares to challenge us; but we cannot \\"win\\" a war with insurgents or factionalists who look upon us as an occupying power and have the support of a significant portion of the population. <br />  <br />Lest some readers think my review is biased in favor of the \\"leftist\\" or \\"liberal\\" position on the war, let me inform you that my views are in accord with traditional American conservatism (Classical Liberalism) which adheres to at least five fundamental tenets, one of which states that we should refrain from getting involved in foreign political entanglements, particularly of the military variety. This is an important book and I recommend it to all readers.	2005-07-23

Williams is an experimental psychologist with 20 years of experience conducting studies for academic, government, and private research firms. He has also written dozens of technical reports and journal articles, and is the author of \\"How Do You Compare?,\\" a book I reviewed last year and to which I gave a positive review, considering it a worthy contribution to what some call \\"pop psychology.\\" This particular category of literature, often unfairly dismissed by intellectual \\"purists\\" as \\"not fit for any but the simplest of minds,\\" has always had a wide audience and, I suspect, even been read by those intellectuals who have been critical of it. The term \\"pop psychology\\" is, in my opinion, a perfectly appropriate name for this type of work which appeals, after all, to a popular audience (hence the designation as \\"pop\\") and ought to be considered in the same vein as \\"popular science,\\" which not even active scientists have a problem with. As long as a work in \\"pop psychology\\" doesn't fall into the trap of \\"faddism\\" (and \\"How Do You Compare?\\" did not do so) no one should have a problem with it, including the professionals. <br />  <br />Now Williams has penned a new work entitled \\"Are You Crazy?: 18 scientific quizzes to test yourself\\" and he asked me to read and review his latest contribution to the genre of pop psychology. Again, this is not a book written for professional psychologists; it is a book written for the ordinary person who has an interest in psychology and, in this particular case, in \\"self-psychology\\"; that is, Williams is providing a means for the common Joe or Jane to ask and analyze questions and answers about a fundamental question that virtually everyone has asked himself or herself at some point in life: \\"Am I crazy?\\" If you have never raised that question about yourself, then, I submit, you may really need to read this book and take the tests! <br />  <br />As he did in his previous book, Williams takes a really serious subject and presentsit in an entertaining way without doing insult to the seriousness of the matter at hand. He has culled questions from a variety of psychological tests and you are encouraged to answer these questions, score yourself, and analyze your responses based on certain criteria. These \\"quizzes\\" are generally \\"subjective\\" in nature, that is, they deal with what is called the \\"affective\\" domain rather than the \\"cognitive\\" domain of human existence. Strictly speaking, there are no \\"right answers,\\" only \\"honest\\" or \\"dishonest\\" ones. On the great temple at Delphi in ancient Greece were inscribed the words \\"Know Thyself,\\" probably the most basic imperative we as human beings need recognize and accept. So here is the opportunity to \\"know\\" something about yourself, not yourself in any comprehensive way, of course; that would involve a battery of tests taken over many days under professional supervision. Williams merely provides the opportunity to privately gain some insight into your \\"self,\\" and make some evaluations regarding your current psychological status. Are you really crazy? Maybe -- or maybe not. <br />  <br />It should be pointed out that, while many of the quizzes are interesting and entertaining, some of the \\"tests\\" do have serious implications. For instance, Chapter 3, entitled \\"Consumed with passion: eating and drinking disorders,\\" deals with some very significant physical and psychological problems, problems which can be life threatening. Your responses to the questions involving eating disorders or use of alcohol, for example, may make you aware of a problem you actually have and for which you should seek professional help. So this book, while it does have its lighter side, also has a serious one. While the tests included do not, of course, provide for in-depth diagnosis of any serious psychological problem, they may, on the other hand, provide an indication of an unrecognized problem for which one should seek help. <br />  <br />A lot of readers, I am sure, will beparticularly interested in Chapter 4 which deals with \\"Sexual Peccadilloes.\\" Since I read Havelock Ellis' \\"Psychology of Sex\\" many years ago, and which describes virtually every sexual behavior humanly possible, nothing in this chapter surprised me and I admittedly glossed over it. I was far more interested in his chapter on fears and phobias. Here I learned some new things. For instance, I had never heard of \\"hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia,\\" which I suspect is a rather uncommon type of phobia. Live and learn, as I like to recommend to myself and others. Oh, you may be asking, what is the nature of that phobia I just mentioned? Well, you'll just have to read the book to find out. There are many other unusual phobias also on the list that Williams provides. Maybe you suffer from one or more of them. (As far as I know, I only suffer from two phobias and they are not listed; they also don't interfere with my life -- fortunately.) <br />  <br />There are many interesting anecdotes in \\"Are You Crazy?,\\" and I'm sure most readers will be fascinated by stories about people who have, to say the least, rather odd proclivities. Such as those who lie about deaths in the family in order to collect sympathy cards. Or those who crave dirt and eat it by the handful. Or, worse, those who feel the need to amputate an arm or a leg in order to feel good about themselves. Many of the behaviors discussed in Williams' book may simply be described as \\"quirky.\\" Others do border on the truly \\"crazy.\\" Some are basically harmless. But some are deadly serious. Regardless of the category that any human behavior may be assigned to, every reader of this work will learn something about human behavior in general, and something about his or her psychological life in particular. Furthermore, every reader will probably gain some insights into the behaviors of individual friends and members of the family. I don't hesitate in recommending Williams' new contribution to all readers who take themselves and their life seriously. <br />	2005-07-21
US	52858812	R3N9H7KVX8F6J6	0805066330	801514174	A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America	Books	5	7	10	N	N	A Great Read -- Just Simply Great!	It is always a pleasure to be able to give the highest marks for a book that can bring reading pleasure to all readers. Stacy Schiff's \\"A Great Improvisation\\" is just such a book. American history buffs and those interested in history in general will enjoy this book immensely. I can recommend it without any hesitation. Stacy Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize winner for one of her previous books, exhibits an outstanding writing style combined with a flair for the interesting details (often unreported) that make for a great historical read. <br />  <br />Benjamin Franklin, without a doubt, is one of the great figures in American history. Also he was one of the most provocative and, yet, one of the least known of the American Founders. Oh, I know most educated Americans have learned something about this dynamic genius in high school and college classes in American history, but, however, what most don't know about the \\"complex\\" Franklin and the intimacies of both his personal and political life could fill volumes. Schiff has managed to glean the really interesting details and present them in such a way that any discerning reader can enjoy and profit from. <br />  <br />For seven years way back in the 1960s (a period that is ancient history to most young people today!), I taught American history to eighth graders in a public school. I always included some mention of and discussion of Benjamin Franklin and his part in the formation of the American republic. The experiments in electricity, the famous kite and key episode, the lightening rod, his publishing adventures and experience as a printer, and, of course, \\"Poor Richard's Almanac,\\" were all part of the common knowledge that I passed on to my students. More's the pity, however, that I did not have the benefit of Stacy Schiff's research and her book to help my students really grasp the \\"essential\\" Franklin and his \\"real\\" contributions to the American revolution and the unformed youthful government which was in the process of development. <br />  <br />A number of facts emerge from a reading of this book that are important to an understanding of our early history. Considering the context of the times, Benjamin Franklin was the one person who could carry out the mission of obtaining help from the French monarchy in setting up the American republic. He had great personal renown as far as the French were concerned and he was accepted by the French as a great world scholar and genius. Furthermore, he managed to manipulate the relationship between the French aristocrats and the representatives of the young American government with a dignity and diplomacy that probably no other of the Founders could have done, although he had no formal training in the handling of foreign affairs. <br />  <br />Not all went well during Franklin's endeavor to secure the backing of the French government for America's cause. He was deeply resented by some of the early American leaders and he had to contend with British spies (not to mention a son who was a loyalist and ran off to England), double agents working both sides of the Atlantic and both sides of the war effort, and was accused at various points of complicity against the interests of the young American republic and of downright fraud. Nevertheless, he remained on the \\"mark,\\" so to speak, and helped to bring to fruition one of the greatest accomplishments in all of world history. <br />  <br />Some of the book may strike the reader as an early American soap opera since there is much told about Franklin's idiosyncrasies and personal relationships while he lived in France during this time. For me, the gossipy details about life in Paris and at Passy (where Franklin lived for much of his time in France) helped to set the environment within which Franklin lived and moved and accomplished the great things he did. His personal relationships with his noble French lady-friends, and with his grandchildren Temple and Benny who accompanied him to France, are all an important part of the story and add an important dimension to getting a handle on the \\"real\\" Benjamin Franklin, a unique personality whose character is extremely complex and very broad. <br />  <br />I have to compliment Stacy Schiff on including a number of useful tools in her fine work on Benjamin Franklin. I am very sensitive about resources provided by nonfiction authors in their books intended for nonprofessional readers. Right at the beginning the author gives the reader a \\"cast of characters,\\" that is, the main personalities the reader will encounter as he or she is reading. This is a great help in placing important personages in proper context at the first meeting. I wish more authors would do that. <br />  <br />At the end of her work, Schiff offers a chronology -- a timeline -- which helps the reader to place important events in order and determine the significance of the relationships between and among them. Another important element which I wish more writers of history would employ. Then she provides more than three dozen pages of notes and references, a valuable tool for those who want to followup on specific topics. A selected bibliography is also included along with the standard index of subjects. All in all, a history buff's paradise. <br />  <br />\\"A Great Improvisation\\" is a book to be read carefully and thoughtfully, and, above all, savored for its insights into the life of one of America's greatest octogenarians, a true patriot, a renaissance-man of the first-order, a genius (but a common man), a personality larger than life, one whose achievements must rank amongst those of the most celebrated in all of human history. Schiff's work is a remarkable literary achievement and I highly recommend it to all readers.	2005-06-26
US	52858812	R3ISQGCHQX0TQU	1587991594	522836433	The Washing Machine: How Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Soils Us	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Very, Very Interesting and Things I Didn't Know	The last time I was involved in money laundering was when I forgot I had left a couple of dollars in the pocket of my pants and put them into the washing machine, only to realize when I transferred the pants to the dryer that I had, in fact, laundered some money. Other than that encounter, I had no knowledge whatsoever about, nor experience with, what is now referred to as \\"professional\\" and \\"criminal\\" money laundering. Of course, my activity was neither professional nor criminal. But, after reading Nick Kochan's book, \\"The Washing Machine,\\" I now know a lot about a particular nefarious enterprise which is both professional and criminal. And, unfortunately, a continually growing threat to world peace and security. <br />  <br />Mr. Kochan is just the right person to write this book. An investigative reporter, Kochan has investigated a number of financial frauds and scams for many years and has written for such prestigious publications as \\"The Economist,\\" \\"Financial Times,\\" and other well-respected media. He is also a well-known broadcaster who appears regularly on the BBC television and radio networks, and has served as a consultant to a number of British and international corporations on political and economic risk. <br />  <br />Many ordinary readers may not at first see the relevance of the money-laundering problem to their daily life. Kochan will convince you otherwise. The problem is truly serious, non-endemic, and affects us all in a very direct way. Moreover, money laundering is not just a matter of \\"criminal\\" activity anymore, committed by those who simply want to hide their ill-gotten gains from the authorities, but money laundering is now used by international terrorists to hide their sources of revenue for the financing of their attacks on civilized societies. This raises the bar and should convince any citizen, whatever his or her position in any society or nation, to acquire some information about the current threat in order to help combat what has become an increasingly threatening situation. <br />  <br />We are at risk. The world is at risk. The author of this book makes that clear. He provides the facts and asks the reader to consider the probabilities. Don't know anything about the Russian Mafia? Read and learn. Don't know anything about the reputable banks (many who advertise their services on American television) who \\"somehow\\" have been involved in the money-laundering schemes of criminals and terrorists? Read and learn. Don't know that some so-called \\"friends\\" of the United States, such as Ireland, Turkey, and Sri Lanka, are involved in terrorist finance? Read and learn. And on and on. You'll be surprised, and maybe somewhat depressed, with the facts that Kochan presents in his book. <br />  <br />You will go deep into a world you probably don't know much about, the world of international business, the whole globalization thing you read about in the newspapers and magazines and most likely don't pay much attention to. You will learn how financial criminals and international terrorists can turn \\"dirty\\" money into \\"clean\\" money, often with the help of banks and other financial institutions with whom you are personally acquainted. And, you will learn why the battle against this type of activity is so difficult to win. <br />  <br />The author of \\"The Washing Machine\\" has provided a number of resources to aid the reader in coming to grips with the subject. I always like it when the author of a nonfiction work provides us, the readers, with more resources to consult or pursue. In this case, Kochan includes a glossary at the end of the book so even the most inexpert of us can grasp any acronyms or terms currently used in discussing this subject. He also provides the reader with references (by specific source!), plus a bibliography and a topic index. <br />  <br />I would think this book would appeal to anyone with an interest in the world economy, the controversial matter of globalization, the threat of international terrorism, organized criminal activity on a global scale, and/or the techniques of money laundering on a momentous scale, an interesting subject in itself. At the very least, this book made me aware of a problem that appears to be ubiquitous in today's world. Maybe more of us should pay attention to it. Before it is too late.	2005-06-26
US	52858812	RASXQWLI24VE5	0805077545	899329312	Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu	Books	5	25	26	N	N	A Great Personal Journey - An Exciting Personal Account	First of all let me say: I love first-person accounts of events and activities. There is nothing more fascinating, in my opinion, than reading about the experiences that someone has endured firsthand and who is providing an interpretation of those very experiences. Even more fascinating and, for that matter, relevant, is someone who is providing us with a diary or journal about contemporary events that we are watching or reading about on the daily news via television, radio, magazines, and the newspapers. Yaroslav Trofimov, in his book \\"Faith at War,\\" is doing just that. <br />  <br />While I may contest the author's interpretations of the experiences he has had, I cannot in good faith dispute the \\"facts\\" of his experiences. He is, so to speak, \\"telling it as it is and as it was,\\" and I cannot argue with that, considering the fact he has \\"been there\\" and \\"done that.\\" I have not experienced what he has, nor have I gone where he has gone. I have to listen to what he has to say, as does every reader of his book. He has, however, provided me with an insight into much which I didn't understand and which, I hope, others who read his book, can begin to understand as well. <br />  <br />Considering what is going on \\"really\\" in our world today, Trofimov, in his \\"Faith at War,\\" does provide a window that all of us need to consider and contemplate. There is no question about the relevance of his subject. Islam and what is going on in the Middle East is important to us all. Trofimov, who covers the Middle East and Islamic culture for the \\"Wall Street Journal,\\" gives us an insightful look into what is going on and what may be anticipated in that part of the world. <br />  <br />I think what impressed me most about Trofimov's book is the lack of an obvious political agenda, a problem which afflicts most books about the Middle East \\"problem\\" today and which he seems to deliberately avoid. His appears to be merely a \\"sane\\" account of his own experiences as those experiences occurred. While no personal narrative is completely free of some editorial position, Trofimov certainly doesn't, in my view, flaunt any particular political prejudice. <br />  <br />I was particularly interested in his discussion of Mali, a \\"democratic\\" country in Africa where most of the people are Muslim. This was news to me; but, then, I don't currently study African nations or society. While I was under the impression that almost every country which was Islamic was \\"undemocratic\\" by nature of the religion, it was refreshing to learn that that was not exactly true. <br />  <br />The journey that Trofimov takes is actually awesome. The book begins in Saudi Arabia (and he provides some information that every American needs to know), proceeds on to Tunisia (\\"Teaching Freud to the Mullahs,\\" 'nuff said), then on to Yemen and Kuwait, then on to Iraq (very, very interesting to say the least), then on to Afghanistan for two chapters, ending with chapters on Lebanon, Mali (the \\"Muslim democracy\\"), and finally Bosnia (which is primarily Muslim in case you have forgotten or not watched the news for the past decade). <br />  <br />This book is a personal journal or diary. There is no getting around that. But it is an interesting and intriguing account from a first-rate observer of the contemporary scene. There is, in my view, no getting around that. The author also provides an interesting and valuable glossary of religious and political terms related to the subject he is discussing, an index of topics, and a number of maps so the reader can place geographical areas and regions in context. Hurray for those tools, especially for the ordinary reader who is not a specialist. <br />  <br />Altogether, I recommend this book just on the basis that I enjoyed reading it. Like I said, I enjoy reading first-person accounts. Maybe it's the psychology of the \\"vicarious\\" experience. Whatever, Trofimov's book is a good read and an exciting adventure and I think most readers who are interested inwhat's going on in our world today will like this book. Highly recommended.	2005-06-26
US	52858812	R3G3VD7A4RYRSJ	1400062136	310528186	No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam	Books	5	471	532	N	N	An Excellent Overview of Islam	A few days after I was asked if I'd be willing to review Reza Aslan's new book \\"No god but God,\\" and before I committed myself to doing so, I happened to catch the author's appearance on NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\" where he and four other gentlemen were discussing the role of religion in current affairs. The panel included the author, two Protestant leaders, one Roman Catholic theologian, and an editor from a news magazine, and Aslan was by far the youngest participant. I was so impressed with his discussion of the topic, particularly in reference to the impact of Islam on the world today, its historical antecedents, and what is currently going on, that I immediately consented to read and review his book. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Reza Aslan is a brilliant young scholar of Islam and also of comparative religion in general, just the sort that we so dearly need today when there is so much confusion surrounding one of the world's great historical religions and its theological beliefs and political intentions. Born in Iran a few years prior to the overthrow of the Shah and the return of the Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, the young boy was whisked out of the country and settled in the United States. Later, he studied religions at Santa Clara University, Harvard University, and the University of California at Santa Barbara. At the University of Iowa he received a master's degree in fine arts and served as a visiting assistant professor of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies. In my opinion, one of the advantages he has when speaking and writing about Islam for the American audience is that he is not only knowledgeable about his own heritage, but appears to be thoroughly acquainted with the Western religious tradition and the American culture. This places him in an extremely enviable position for a discussion about the impact of Islam on contemporary geopolitics.<br /><br />There is little doubt in my own mind, after listening to many Christian leaders and thinkers expound their views about Islam in the popular press (particularly after the 9/11 tragedy), that an unfamiliarity with the history, tradition, and beliefs of Islam abounds in the United States and, probably, in most of the West as well. (This, by the way, has always struck me as strange since I have always considered Islam to be a \\"western\\" religion, along with Judaism and Christianity, as contrasted with the \\"eastern\\" religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and so forth.) Anyway, some of the more recent and scurrilous attacks on Islam and its founder -- \\"Muhammad is a pedophile,\\" for instance -- by some \\"leaders\\" of Christian churches, show an abysmal ignorance of Islam and its founder, not to mention a frightening lack of perspective in this age of scandals involving Christian televangelists consorting with prostitutes and perpetrating financial fraud and Catholic priests going to prison for the sexual abuse of minors. I won't discuss the Muhammad-pedophilia issue here as Aslan provides the explanation in his book, but the charge made against the founder of Islam, while groundless and misunderstood, is also very stupid.<br /><br />Most of \\"No god but God\\" is devoted to a history of Islam. But it must be understood that this is not a singular nor simple chronological presentation. I suspect there's a presumption among most Westerners, and particularly non-Muslim Americans, that Islam is a rather uncomplicated fanatical faith that is deliberately trying to destroy Western civilization and replace it with some sort of theocratic tyranny. Well, Aslan will straighten you about that. Islam is a very complex faith and his history of it is intertwined with accounts of internecine disputes over doctrinal and moral theology, over leadership and hegemony, over traditions as opposed to meeting contemporary necessities, and all sorts of other problems which any movement -- be it political, social, or religious -- is bound to face. These internal conflicts within Islam should not be a surprise to anyone knowledgeable about the history of Christianity. In fact, one of the things that intrigued me most about his account of the \\"philosophical\\" history of Islam is how it parallels in many respects the \\"philosophical\\" history of Christianity. After all, Christianity is hardly a \\"unified\\" movement and hasn't been for over a thousand years (think Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, just to mention three).<br /><br />Islam, contrary to the common view of most Americans, is not a unified religious force with a totalitarian script written by theocrats who want to dominate the entire world. There are various factions -- \\"sects,\\" if you will -- within Islam opposed to each other. This appears to have been the case almost from the beginning. While some factions within Islam have striven to create theocratic states, others have supported the building of democratic, pluralistic societies. Think about the current situation in Iraq with the disputes between the Shi'ites and the Sunni, both religious factions of Islam. Then think about Wahhabism, another faction which arose in Saudi Arabia and is much more \\"fundamentalistic.\\" Think \\"Taliban,\\" probably the most extremist of the Islamic factions. Islam is hardly a unified movement, anymore than modern Christianity is. Aslan goes to great lengths in his book to explain all this and does a superb job doing it. And he shows, I think, that Islam can live and thrive in a modern democratic and pluralistic world, without being the \\"threat\\" that many have envisioned.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. If there's one thing we need desperately today it is an understanding of other religions and philosophies. Islam is a mysterious faith to many Americans. Fear is most often founded upon ignorance. And there can no longer be a justification for ignorance about a major religion which is so impacting the world's stage today. The world is getting smaller every hour. Isolationism and parochialism are no longer viable options. We either learn to live together or we destroy each other. Read, contemplate, discuss, and understand.

US	52858812	RI0KQ7XPC0QNJ	1579547117	619620568	Field Notes on the Compassionate Life: A Search for the Soul of Kindness	Books	5	70	73	N	N	A Well-written Excursion into the Realm of Compassion...	I will admit at the outset that this is not the sort of book I would normally be attracted to as I roamed the shelves of books at a bookstore. It would probably be shelved in the \\"self-help\\" section and I don't usually spend any time there. Categorizing Barasch's work as a self-help book, which some reviewers and bookstores have apparently done, is, I think, a mistake, and may result in some potential readers from being exposed to it. Like me, for instance. I probably wouldn't have become aware of \\"Field Notes on the Compassionate Life\\" had a publishers' representative not sent it to me for reading and review. I'm glad he did. It is an interesting work and especially well-written; the author has a literary style reminiscent of Henry David Thoreau and Joseph Wood Krutch. <br /> <br />Rather than place the \\"self-help\\" label on Barasch's book, I would consider the work a \\"personal journey\\" into the meaning and practice of \\"compassion,\\" that somewhat elusive concept which so often befuddles us and is so often ignored because it smacks of \\"do-goodism\\" and \\"touchy-feely\\" pop-psychology. Fortunately, Barasch doesn't descend into that muddy swamp; instead, he conducts his search for the \\"soul of kindness\\" in a most empirical way by actually doing some field work on the subject (hence, the \\"Field Notes\\" in the title), somewhat like a cultural anthropologist going about trying to find out how some specific characteristic of a tribe functions and what its \\"meaning\\" is to the members of the group. <br /> <br />If there is anything the world needs (and has always needed, for that matter) it is love, empathy, compassion, and kindliness. Or, maybe, we can sum all of those characteristics up in that good old word \\"charity\\" in its full and traditional meaning. Whatever the case, Barasch proceeds to investigate the subject, drawing not only on the experience of his personal encounters with actual human beings, but integrating that experience with data from neuropsychology, biology, quantum physics, history, and the social sciences, with help from theological and philosophical traditions, and even the results from some current research in the field of medical science. Some commonly accepted \\"truths\\" are challenged by Barasch. For instance, Barasch finds among bonobo chimpanzees a model for caring group behavior that he believes undermines Darwin's evolutionary idea of the survival of the fittest. Could it be that the great driving force of our evolution was really \\"survival of the kindest\\"? And what does this mean about us today and what could this mean about our future? <br /> <br />Regarding what I have just said in the above paragraph, does the word \\"comprehensive\\" come to mind? It should, because this is indeed a comprehensive journey into the theory and practice of human benevolence. Barasch is conducting a search into the heart of the meaning of \\"compassion,\\" using resources from virtually every area of the human experience. What can we learn from people who are exceptionally empathetic in their relation to others? Is there a way to help people become kinder toward other people? How do we and should we treat people who have done us harm? Can we actually transform ourselves and our society in general so that incidents of compassionate and benevolent behavior are increased? How can this be done? <br /> <br />You'll meet many interesting people along this journey the author writes about, including the homeless, the disadvantaged, and the dispossessed. (Barasch actually becomes one of the \\"homeless\\" for a period of time, in order to experience the condition.) But you'll also meet people such as an \\"altruistic\\" kidney donor, a circumstance which raises a question about far compassionate outreach should be extended. And you'll meet a father who has an extraordinary relationship with the killer of his daughter, and who has forgiven him for the deed. There is a particularly telling chapter which examines the current Middle Eastern crisis and an educational program which is devoted to resolving the differences -- with understanding and compassion -- between the Palestinian and Israeli children who are the major victims in that horrendous conflict. <br /> <br />Now, I know that some readers (particularly those who are aficionados of Ayn Rand's \\"virtue of selfishness\\") may be disturbed by Barasch's use of certain terms such as \\"altruism\\" and \\"sacrifice.\\" I want to make them aware they should be careful before pouncing on Barasch's use of those terms and simply dismissing the author as another \\"irrational and immoral\\" promulgator of \\"self-sacrifice.\\" He is not. Read the book carefully and you'll see how he himself wrestles with the issues of altruism and sacrifice. There are extremists on both sides of this question. There are those who are so self-absorbed (genuinely \\"selfish\\" in the traditional sense) that everyone wants to avoid them and it is a wonder they can live in normal human society at all. Then there are those who are so \\"other-absorbed\\" (genuinely \\"altruistic\\" in the Randian sense) that a normal human being would want to avoid them altogether because their \\"self-obsession\\" for \\"others\\" is so bothersome and so often \\"suspect.\\" There is a middle (read \\"moderate\\") road here which Barasch walks during his journey, avoiding either extreme. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I think \\"Field Notes on the Compassionate Life\\" is worth a read by anyone who is interested in human nature, benevolence, compassion, personal happiness, and the future of humanity. The world is in a sad state of affairs. We have tried hate, war, discrimination, capital punishment, and all sorts of other antihuman policies to make what we thought would be a better world. These have failed. For how many centuries does humankind have to knock its head against the same wall of malice toward others until it comes to its senses? Maybe we ought to try a little compassion, a little kindliness, a little benevolence toward our fellow human beings andsee if that works. It would certainly be easier on the head, not to mention on the wall.	2005-03-23

I don't usually write book reviews for novels or books that generally are considered to be works of \\"fiction,\\" although I regularly read a great many novels for my own enjoyment, merely for the sake of recreation. Now and then, however, a novel comes along that I consider to be a work of \\"fiction that makes an important point.\\" This is the case with Gen LaGreca's new novel, \\"Noble Vision.\\" Written in the tradition of Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" and Dean Koontz's \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart,\\" LaGreca's book does, indeed, \\"make an important point,\\" and does it superbly. The battlefield is sociopolitical geography and the war is rational individualism against state totalitarianism. <br />  <br />The basic plot of the novel is really quite simple, but the philosophical ramifications are profound. Dr. David Lang, a noted and successful neurosurgeon, has discovered a way to regenerate nerve tissue. The government (of the state of New York, in this case) will not allow him to try his experimental procedure on Nicole Hudson, a professional ballerina who has become blind because of a fall which occurred during an explosion at the theater where she was performing. And why can't Dr. Lang help Nicole to possibly regain her sight with his new medical breakthrough? Well, because medical practice in New York is now regulated by the state's socialized medicine program (named, interestingly enough, \\"CareFree\\"), and Dr. Lang's procedure has not yet been \\"officially\\" approved. It doesn't matter, of course, that Nicole, as his patient, has granted him permission to try the new procedure. <br />  <br />There are a number of subplots in the story, adding complexity to both the major theme of the novel and the suspense experienced by the reader, and a cast of characters who are clearly drawn and with whom the reader will either identify or vilify. The state's governor is an exemplar of the truly corrupt politician; the head of the state's socialized medicine program is a compromised physician (who just happens to be Dr. Lang's father!); and Marie Lang, David's wife, who is also a physician but one who has caved in to the powers-that-be, has given up her dream of being a cardiologist to be a general practitioner because that was the \\"socially correct\\" thing to do. Other characters grace the pages of this fine novel and the reader has no trouble determining where they stand in relation to the main theme of the book. Yes, it's pretty much black and white, and that's the way good fiction ought to be when it's trying to get the reader to think about an important issue. This is what fiction in the \\"Romantic\\" tradition is meant to be. In LaGreca's novel there are no namby-pamby gray areas of moral indecisiveness; there are no colorless characters who couldn't be heroes or villains because they wouldn't know the difference; there is no compromise between true individualism and the suffocating policies of state collectivism. Hurray for that! <br />  <br />Remember Hilary Clinton's proposed healthcare program back in the 1990s? One thought that occurred to me as I read further into this novel was how close this story was to what probably would have occurred if her healthcare program had, in fact, been implemented. One point that stood out was this: in the Clinton program, as I recall, a physician could be fined and/or imprisoned for treating a patient privately. I found such a proposal shocking at the time. In \\"Noble Vision,\\" this possibility becomes \\"real,\\" in the sense that a novel can actually serve to illustrate just how such an immoral policy would be applied if executed, and the consequences of such a misguided program. I am old enough to remember the days when the practice of medicine was considered a \\"calling,\\" and physicians were more concerned about treating their patients than about becoming rich or meeting the arbitrary whims of some bureaucrat. The practice of medicine does not mix well with politics; in fact, I would argue that politics would be(and yet may be) the death of good, sound medical practice. <br />  <br />There are, in my considered opinion, three types of people (or institutions) one should absolutely avoid: Those who say (1) \\"I know what is best for you\\"; (2) \\"I'm only doing this for your own good\\"; and (3) \\"This will hurt me more than it will you.\\" Substitute the \\"State\\" or \\"government\\" for \\"I,\\" or \\"I'm,\\" or \\"me\\" in the above statements and you'll get my point and, I think, the warning that this novel provides. Socialized medicine is, in reality, \\"antisocial\\" medicine, and the evidence can be found in the failing programs implemented in countries such as England and Canada. LaGreca's novel simply brings this idea into \\"reality\\" by showing what would inevitably happen. <br />  <br />A brief word about the writing itself. I am supersensitive to sentence structure and word usage when it comes to fiction. I will cease reading any novel when I begin to pay more attention to the writing itself than to the story. Fortunately, in this case, I have nothing but praise for the writing style of the author. She writes excellent prose; there is no excessive description, which means no superfluous adjectives and adverbs (so common these days), and no complex sentences to confuse the reader, but just a comfortable \\"flow\\" of words, driven by nouns and verbs, which propels the story forward and doesn't interfere with the readers' involvement in the story itself. LaGreca is not only a great storyteller, she is also a great story-stylist. <br />  <br />Now, does Dr. David Lang get to perform his experimental procedure on Nicole Hudson (with whom he is secretly in love), and does it all end well? I am not one to give away the ending of a book which will, I guarantee, keep you turning the pages into the night. An excellent story, highly recommended by one who doesn't do so lightly, especially when it comes to fiction. But, this novel is truly \\"fiction that makes an important point.\\"	2005-03-15
US	52858812	R3R0DACFYKGZI7	0757300669	6197688	Happiness Is.: Unexpected Answers to Practical Questions in Curious Times	Books	5	16	17	N	N	A very serious topic discussed in an entertaining package...	When the author of \\"Happiness Is.\\" contacted me by e-mail and asked if I would be interested in reading and reviewing his latest book, I felt that I should warn him in advance regarding my views of traditional and contemporary psychiatry, some of which are posted on my website under the heading \\"The Psychiatric Game.\\" So, to be fair and upfront with Dr. Shawn Christopher Shea, the author of the book, and provide him with full disclosure, I sent a rather lengthy response to him, outlining my philosophical positions about the theory and practice of psychiatry, about the concept of \\"mental illness\\" as usually defined, and my personal opinions regarding various \\"psychotherapies.\\"    Furthermore, I informed him that I was supportive of the ideas promoted by the iconoclastic-psychiatrist Dr. Thomas Szasz, the theories and practices developed by the \\"Cognitive Therapy\\" movement, and especially the procedures and programs utilized by the \\"Reality\\" therapists as developed by psychiatrist Dr. William Glasser back in the 1970s. I figured my advisory would cause any \\"normal\\" psychiatrist or mental health practitioner to take a pass on me and find a more sympathetic reviewer. Well, Dr. Shea is apparently not your \\"normal\\" psychiatrist and my warnings didn't bother him a bit; he sent the book, I read it, and here is my brief review of a delightful book that I recommend without any hesitation to anyone interested in improving his or her life and pursuing that sometimes elusive phenomenon we call \\"happiness.\\"    I know it's hard to believe, but here is a psychiatrist who can write an informative book for the common person in ordinary English, fill it with interesting anecdotes, compelling stories, and engaging personalities (including such diverse figures as the famous \\"elephant man\\" John Merrick, Saint Francis of Assisi, the mystical Julian of Norwich, ice skating champion Michelle Kwan, the celebrated Helen Keller, the Dalai Lama, and more), and entertain the reader with a wittystyle and appropriate humor, all while discussing a serious subject that is probably number one on anybody's list: What is happiness and how can we work toward achieving it? That, I suggest, is quite a feat, and Dr. Shea, in my opinion, pulls it off with flying colors. Even the clever subtitles that he uses throughout the book make their point in such a way that is both entertaining and memorable.    An initial remark about the term \\"happiness\\" may be advisable, particularly for those who are within the same philosophical tradition as I am, that is, the Classical Realism of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. The term \\"happiness\\" as used by the author in his book is not quite the same as it is used, for instance, by Aristotle, who defines happiness as \\"action in accordance with virtue.\\" Aristotle's definition is primarily an \\"ethical\\" definition and perfectly appropriate for the context in which that great philosopher employs that concept.    On the other hand, Dr. Shea's use of the term \\"happiness\\" is perfectly appropriate within \\"philosophical anthropology\\" or that broad philosophical discipline which thinks about human beings and their activities in the widest sense possible. Many of the principles, for example, that the book's author discusses, have a philosophical foundation but are used in an applied or practical sense. There is no contradiction here between the two uses of the term \\"happiness\\" because the term is used in different, yet related, contexts. Dr. Shea's \\"happiness\\" is what most of us Classical Realists would refer to as \\"overall contentment\\" or, maybe, a \\"feeling of personal fulfillment.\\" And these are certainly important objectives.    One critic seems to think that \\"Happiness Is.\\" doesn't contain anything really original. This is probably true in the sense that all the ideas contained within the text have been discussed many times in other works. I submit, however, that the way in which Dr. Shea utilizes these concepts and develops his model of the \\"human matrix\\" and applies the strategies suggested by his model to ordinary human situations is unique and, furthermore, probably more valuable to the general reader than the complicated \\"academic\\" models which have filled the literature of psychology and psychiatry for generations.    Let's give the good doctor a break here. He makes it quite clear, at least to me, that his book is for the public at large, for the ordinary educated reader, for the common man or woman full of intellectual curiosity and a need for explanation and commonsense guidance, not for that narrow group of professionals whose writings may be sophisticated and \\"academic,\\" but are largely ignored and dismissed by the general public as chimerical.    The key concept presented in this book is a model which Dr. Shea calls the \\"human matrix.\\" This matrix is \\"a set of systems whose ultimate composite functioning creates something new, something completely unique, a distinctive, one time only pattern with each passing second.\\" It consists of five \\"wings\\": Biological, Psychological, Interpersonal, Environmental, and Spiritual. Each of these wings, in the ideal state, must be in healthy balance with all the others. There are a few \\"rules\\" which apply regarding this situation. For instance, there is the \\"Interdependence Rule\\" which states that \\"All wings of the human matrix intersect and are interdependent upon one another.\\" There are three other rules which follow.    Further on, there are the \\"principles\\" and \\"strategies.\\" For example, the Cast a Wide Net Principle states that \\"No matter what the apparent cause of the immediate unhappiness, look at all wings of the matrix for contributing problems related to smaller yet still damaging matrix effects.\\" Later, there are the \\"paradoxes,\\" such as the Paradox of the Multiplicitous Knob which suggests that one \\"Eagerly change the wings of the matrix yet make changes with caution for every knob you change is two.\\" (You'll have to read the book to see what thismeans!)    I enthusiastically recommend Dr. Shea's book to all. I have reviewed a lot of books over the past few years, but this one has got to be in the top of my \\"A-List.\\"	2005-02-19

We will always have the very wealthy and we will always have the poor. The rich and the poor, representing the two extremes on a social spectrum, must, however, be the minorities in any stable society. The middle-class represents what we ordinarily refer to as the \\"mainstream.\\" It seems obvious then that the future of a stable and prosperous society must always rest with the generation coming of age and that middle-class adults, particularly those who are involved in the raising of middle-class youth, should be nurturing these younger members, preparing them to take their place as responsible adults in the larger society, thereby guaranteeing the continued stability and prosperity of that society. <br />  <br />But, according to sociologist Elliott Currie, not all is kosher among middle-class youth in America and he provides an interesting investigation into the core causes of the epidemic of violence, drug abuse, and hopelessness among those American teenagers who are part of what is generally called \\"mainstream America,\\" that is, these teenagers are true members of the middle-class and do not represent the impoverished young people of the poorer class who are generally thought to be responsible for most of the antisocial behavior in our society and who are considered to be \\"disadvantaged\\" and \\"alienated\\" from the larger society as a whole. <br />  <br />The title of Currie's book, \\"The Road to Whatever,\\" I initially found to be very curious and I wasn't quite sure what the author really meant. It didn't take long to discover why he was using that particular title. Indeed, if the current crisis among middle-class adolescents is to be marked with a single word, the word \\"whatever\\" is about as good a word as one can use. \\"Whatever,\\" in the sense which seems to be used in this book, is full of meaning and embodies an expression of carelessness, heedlessness, despair, thoughtlessness, riskiness, and so on, behaviors and attitudes which are not considered desirable attributes to be fostered in our young. Too many middle-class youths in America are not on the \\"Road to Maturity,\\" or the \\"Road to Success,\\" or the \\"Road to Prosperity.\\" They are, well, on the road to \\"Whatever.\\" <br />  <br />What, asks Currie, has brought this phenomenon about? What is going on in American culture that appears to be the catalyst for this circumstance? What are the root causes, if any? The author rejects the usual answers we hear all over the media from the pundits, partisans, and self-declared experts. Some say it is violence and sex on television that is responsible. Others claim it is the new \\"permissiveness\\" in our society which causes these young people to behave and feel as they do. Still others point to other causes and suggest solutions, some of which can easily be described as \\"Draconic.\\" Currie discusses these issues, provides a critical analysis, and dismisses them. <br />  <br />There are a number of points the author makes which I found right on the mark and, although I may tend to interpret them in a slightly different way, he and I are basically in agreement (I think). Currie says that many of our middle-class youths are living in a \\"culture of exclusion.\\" I suspect he is correct. The communities our young people are growing up in today are not as supportive of the young as those of the past. Today, even simple and unintended mistakes made by teenagers are not overlooked, but seem to generate a social outcry for an immediate solution, even to the point where the punishment for infractions far exceeds the consequences of the infraction itself. The recent \\"zero tolerance\\" policies, so beloved now by public schools, are an example of the unforgiving nature which has come to dominate interactions between \\"authority\\" figures and adolescents. <br />  <br />Another important issue raised by Currie is the widespread use of medications to control young people who don't meet societal or parental expectations, or are otherwise \\"out of control.\\" For over twenty years, I have been trying to draw attention to this abuse of pharmacology, beginning with the overuse of the drug Ritalin back in the 1980s. I've also been critical of the tendency among so-called \\"mental health\\" professionals to \\"manufacture\\" diseases and \\"syndromes\\" where none can actually be objectively shown to exist, but it is easier to label and categorize, then \\"treat\\" and medicate, resulting, of course, in profits in somebody's pocket. I am in complete agreement with Currie, if I rightly understand his position, on the matters of behavioral medications and adolescent psychotherapy. <br />  <br />In general, Currie does an outstanding job of analyzing, dissecting, and criticizing contemporary middle-class society in America and the crisis which has resulted for teenagers growing up within the current cultural milieu. Much of the material he presents is anecdotal, actual interviews with middle-class adolescents involved in various forms and degrees of self-destructive behavior. These are not the kids from the other side of the tracks. These are not the disadvantaged or the impoverished. These are, however, the future of American society and culture. These are the kids who will determine what sort of communities this nation has in the years to come. <br />  <br />The concluding chapter of the book, entitled \\"Toward a Culture of Support,\\" suggests some reforms which Currie thinks are important to implement in order that the present problem be resolved. Most of them are well thought out and reasonably supported. A few I would want to discuss with him further because they involve philosophical issues with which I might take issue. I can think of one or two suggestions for reform I might suggest, but he doesn't include. Be that as it may, I hope the book is widely read and discussed; the problem is out there and Professor Currie's work is an excellent place to begin the conversation.	2005-01-21

It is unfortunate that a book such as this has to be written. One would think that intelligent beings, such as we claim to be, would long ago have realized that there is not an endless quantity of oil on this planet and that a largely petroleum-based economy, such as we are, would eventually run out of that basic resource. We should have been furiously seeking a comparative alternative, beginning many decades ago. Now we face a self-created dilemma, as Michael Klare so clearly points out in \\"Blood and Oil.\\" <br />  <br />The United States consumes about 25% of the world's oil supply, yet the population of the United States is less than 5% of the world's total. We are, in other less-complimentary words, \\"oil hogs.\\" We love energy and the benefits it provides and, unfortunately, most of the energy we consume is related in some way, directly or indirectly, to petroleum. It must be noted, however, that the day is coming when energy derived from petroleum is going to be hard to come by as sources of that \\"liquid gold\\" are depleted. And Klare provides most of the statistics one needs to consider. <br />  <br />Most of Klare's book is devoted to a history of the problem and its contemporary ramifications, including the current and ongoing war in Iraq. There are, for instance, a few salient points he makes at the beginning of his book which should be pondered by readers, because they address the motivation for the present military conflict that the United States is engaged in. Consider what the author says in the Preface: <br />  <br />\\"...politicians and pundits regularly deny that there is any connection between blood and oil. 'The only interest the United States has in the [Gulf] region is furthering the cause of peace and stability, not [Iraq's] ability to generate oil,' President Bush's spokesperson, Ari Fleischer, avowed in late 2002. As the drive to war accelerated, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared, 'This is not about oil, and anyone who thinks that, isbadly misunderstanding the situation.' We know that such statements cannot be true -- the entire history of U.S. intervention in the Persian Gulf discredits them...\\" <br />  <br />Now, I know many people will dispute the author's conclusion that \\"such statements cannot be true.\\" But one does have to ask: \\"Why Iraq at this time and not some other unstable region of the world or some other country ruled by a ruthless dictator.\\" There are plenty of areas of the world where people are suffering greater hardships than Iraq was prior to U.S. intervention. I suspect that any critical reader can discern that the only thing Iraq has, outside of a lot of sand and sun, is oil. There is nothing more there to fight over. It is my opinion, upon serious reflection, that we wouldn't be the least bit interested in Iraq and its former or current regime if not for the oil. Here, I think, Klare clearly makes his point and forces us to face the question: \\"Are we willing to continually spill American blood for the sake of providing a comfortable living for the folks at home who insist on all the luxuries provided by a petroleum-based economy?\\" <br />  <br />And that brings me to what Klare has to say in the last chapter of his book: \\"How do we solve the problem?\\" In this chapter he asks, \\"How do we find our way out of this trap?\\" That is, how do we become less dependent on foreign oil and petroleum in general? He suggests it will call for a \\"paradigm shift,\\" that is, a change in our view about energy, and he uses the recent change in attitude about smoking in public places as an example of such a paradigm shift. I submit this is a rather weak illustration since, at least as I see it, the issue of smoking in public places hardly rises to the level of a radical change in political or economic behavior. He might have been better off, perhaps, in using the institution of black slavery and the paradigm shift that occurred over many decades regarding that issue. The changing of attitudes toward slavery, both political and economic, were far more radical and, I suggest, more akin, to what the American public will face in moving from a petroleum-based economy to one that is not. <br />  <br />That matter aside, Klare states that solving the present problem requires progress in the following areas: <br />  <br />\\"...first, divorcing our energy purchases from our overseas security commitments; second, reducing our reliance on imported oil; and third, preparing the way for the inevitable transition to a postpetroleum economy.\\" <br />  <br />Regardless of how one thinks about the petroleum-based economy we enjoy, Klare's analysis of the coming crisis is, I suspect, right on the mark. There is, after all, only so much oil to be exploited. Eventually, as he states, we will run out. Then what? What the author of \\"Blood and Oil\\" seems to be trying to do is to motivate us to take this problem seriously now -- rather than later when it may be too late to do much about it -- and to develop a strategy toward resolving the problem without resorting to the means we are currently using, that is, spilling the blood of American soldiers to protect a resource which is going to disappear anyway in the not-to-distant future. Our government officials and politicians are not being forthright with us. Are we willing to sacrifice America's long-term interests for the current political platitudes which will assure their continuing tenure in office? <br />  <br />Although this is not a great book, it is a timely book, and Klare, I think, forces us to think deeply about what's going on around us right now and what we may face in the near future. I would have to recommend it to all readers interested in our future and the direction our country appears to be taking. (A more comprehensive book review appears on my website at [...]	2004-12-05

Derek Hayes' new book, \\"America Discovered: A Historical Atlas of North American Exploration,\\" should appeal to the members of a number of literary categories, both ordinary and scholarly. First, for those who simply enjoy beautiful coffee-table books, this is one you can be proud to display as the artwork and colorful maps meet the highest standard. Second, if you are an American history buff, this book will enthrall you with its vivid recollections of early continental exploration and later discoveries and settlement across the Western frontier. Third, if you love maps or are into cartography, either as an avocation or as a profession, you will appreciate the numerous historical maps included in the work. Fortunately, I am a member of all three groups, so I especially appreciated Hayes' contribution to my personal library.<br /><br />The author is a trained geographer and map researcher. He attended the University of Hull and the University of British Columbia and has spent many years traveling the world collecting and researching historical maps. This is the fifth historical atlas that Hayes has written and designed. I want to make a special point of \\"written and designed.\\" There are many American history texts which cover the same period and topics which Hayes does in this book. But how many of them are \\"designed\\" to be aesthetically pleasing as well as meeting the highest levels of scholarship. I have some insight into that matter since I taught American history for a number of years. There are not very many books about American history that are both beautifully designed, worth spending time just to contemplate the illustrations, and still exhibit a text worth reading for its own sake.<br /><br />The features and structure of \\"America Discovered: A Historical Atlas of North American Exploration\\" can be briefly stated. There are two hundred and eighty maps included in the book, covering a period of time from the fifteenth century to the twentieth century. This means that the reader can view maps created by cartographers at the \\"initial discovery\\" of America by European adventurers, based on the knowledge of the time, and follow the progression of map creation and design as more and more knowledge is gained about the American continent. It is interesting to note, for instance, that many of the early maps depict the present state of California as an island rather than attached to the American mainland (I didn't know that!). And for those who like geographic trivia, let it be known that this major inaccuracy about California continued even into the nineteenth century. Besides the many maps, there are a number of illustrations displaying persons and events of significance to American history. At the end of the book the author provides a map catalog with some facts about each map, a selected bibliography so readers can continue on with other resources, and a comprehensive index of topics. Lastly, the book is printed on acid-free paper which means it will virtually last forever.<br /><br />Most of my book reviews are nine-hundred to a thousand words in length. This one is not. Why not? Simply because I can find nothing negative at all to say about this superb piece of writing and craftmanship. (Maybe there is a typo somewhere in the text, but if so, I couldn't spot it.) I highly recommend this book to everyone, regardless of whether or not you fit into one of the categories I named in the first paragraph. If you are a true bibliophile, like I am, you will appreciate this addition to your personal library. But a warning or two might be prudent. Older children and teenagers may find the maps in this book so captivating that the book might suffer the damage of overuse. In that case, it might be advisable to purchase two copies: one to use and one to cherish. Moreover, if you decide to purchase one as a gift for a relative or friend, be aware. Once you actually see the quality of this publication, you won't want to part with it. Inthat case, it might be advisable to purchase two copies: one as a gift and one for you to cherish. I think at this point, I've said enough. Any more said would merely be redundant.h it. In that case, it might be advisable to purchase two copies: one as a gift and one for you to cherish.

US	52858812	R1Z7MON7WY1A2X	1594860068	159484493	Trace Your Roots with DNA: Using Genetic Tests to Explore Your Family Tree	Books	5	166	174	N	N	Who would have believed it twenty years ago?...	Millions of Americans have become hooked on genealogy, the science or study of family descent. The popularity of pursuing one's ancestors through tracing one's roots backward generation by generation has soared since the advent of the Internet, which made it possible to rapidly search the world for even remote family members and set up family websites, and the creation of special computer software which enables anyone to use the power of the computer to trace his or her domestic roots. Now it is possible to go to the next level of searching one's family tree through the availability of DNA testing. And that is what this book, \\"Trace Your Roots with DNA,\\" is all about. <br />  <br />Co-author Megan Smolenyak Smolenyak (no, that's not a typo!) has been an eager genealogist for more than thirty years, is an authority on family history research, and was the lead researcher for the Ancestors series on PBS. She is also a contributing editor for \\"Heritage Quest\\" and the author of a number of books related to genealogy and ancestor historiography. The other co-author, Ann Turner, became interested in genealogy when she learned that her parents' ancestors had arrived in the United States on the same ship, yet went their separate ways until her parents met 300 years later. That sort of coincidence would also have piqued my interest in my family history if I knew something like that about my parents. Sometimes facts are really stranger than fiction. <br />  <br />\\"Trace Your Roots with DNA\\" is not really for leisure reading, but it does contain very valuable information for those who want to use the new DNA tests for help in tracing their family ancestry. It contains a lot of technical material (although I hope that point does not scare anyone away), but the authors explain everything in terms which any ordinary person of average intelligence can understand and there are ample illustrations provided to help clarify what is being described. I suggest the reader do a rapid once-through-reading of the book and then consider it a sourcebook, guidebook, or resource to be consulted often. The authors provide a brief introduction to the fundamentals of genealogy and genetics, including a brief overview of classical genetics, blood types, phenotypes, genotypes, molecular genetics, the principles of DNA, and even a short section about mutations. <br />  <br />I found their discussion of the Y chromosome and its ramifications to be especially interesting. The Y chromosome is inherited from fathers and occurs only in males. This was of particular interest to me, not merely because I am of the male gender, but because of the following statement made by the authors: \\"If we had a time machine, we could trace the Y chromosome of every man living today back to one man.\\" Furthermore, say the authors, this \\"Most Recent Common Ancestor\\" of all men was a real person, not an abstraction, and is sometimes called \\"Y-Adam,\\" almost certainly born in Africa less than 100,000 years ago. That to me means that in one important sense all of us males are really related to one another and the differences between us are mainly cosmetic. Talk about male bonding! And that, by the way, is what they called the chapter about this topic: \\"Male Bonding.\\" <br />  <br />Now, don't think that the female of the species is left out of the picture. There is an entire chapter devoted to the \\"Maternal Legacy\\" and the importance of mitochondrial DNA. Since the paternal lineage of all men living today focuses on one man, Y-Adam, can everyone today trace their straight maternal lineage back to one woman? \\"The answer is yes,\\" say the authors, \\"and she is dubbed mitochondrial Eve.\\" Furthermore, similar to Y-Adam, \\"mitochondrial Eve was born somewhere in Africa.\\" But, interestingly enough, \\"she did not live at the same time as him\\" and, \\"while her date of birth is uncertain...most estimates fall within a range of 120,000 to 200,000 years ago, long before Y-Adam.\\" The conclusion? According to the authors, \\"Adam never met Eve!\\" You'll have to read the book yourself for the rest of this story. <br />  <br />The discussion surrounding Y-chromosomes, mitochondrial DNA, geographical origins, and kin relationships includes information about the types of available DNA testing, what kind of information the tests can provide, how to interpret the results, and how the tests work. These test are becoming increasingly inexpensive and reliable and they are as effortless as swabbing the inside of your cheek and mailing a sample to a testing facility. The authors also provide information about joining an ongoing genealogy project or starting and running your own project, as well as information about finding prospects for your project, contacting and courting participants, and interpreting and sharing results. <br />  <br />If you are interested in your family ancestry and want to use the latest tools available in your genealogical research, then this book is one you should have in your personal reference library. The very helpful appendix includes a list of genealogical resources, including special forms which can be downloaded on the Internet, a list of genealogical computer software (some for free!) and websites, both free and commercial, devoted to genealogy and tracing your roots, plus there is a list of DNA testing companies and products, and a glossary to help readers understand the technical terms involved in this subject. The standard index of topics is also provided at the back of the book. All in all, this book is a highly recommended work for those who are participating in or want to participate in this fascinating avocation.	2004-11-06

Ehrman is the chairman of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is a recognized authority on the early Christian church and the life of Jesus Christ, has appeared as an expert on the History Channel, the A&E Channel, and other broadcast venues, and has authored a number of books within his area of scholarship. In response to the popularity of \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" a bestselling novel by Dan Brown, which claims to be based on \\"historical truth,\\" Dr. Ehrman has written \\"Truth and Fiction in the Da Vinci Code\\" as a means of setting the known historical record straight. Brown's novel is in fact not at all accurate in most of its basic religious assertions. That is, Brown's claim that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married, produced a child, and created a royal ancestral line which still exists is \\"fiction\\" not \\"fact,\\" and is not supported by historical records. In my opinion, this book by Professor Ehrman is absolutely essential reading for anyone who has read Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" It challenges the alleged historical \\"facts\\" upon which Brown's novel is based and clears the air, so to speak, about the many controversies which \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has initiated. <br />  <br />In the interest of full disclosure and in case some reader may be critical of this review, let me make the following declarations. Yes, I have read Dan Brown's novel and, being an aficionado of mystery thrillers, I thoroughly enjoyed it and, like Professor Ehrman, found it to be a real page-turner and I would recommend it to all who enjoy this genre. Yes, I have read \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail,\\" by Michael Baigent, et al, the book which Brown seems to have used for much of his \\"historical\\" information, and I was fascinated with the theory presented there about Jesus and Mary Magdalene and the existence of a secret society, the Priory of Sion, which has allegedly protected the secret of the Holy Grail down through the centuries. Furthermore, I formally studied Christian theology and history for four years as an undergraduate at a religious college and know at least something about early Christianity and the beliefs and practices of the various Christian sects in existence at the time. I have also taken Professor Ehrman's course in \\"Lost Christianities: Christian Scriptures and the Battles over Authentication\\" and had the pleasure of reading and reviewing his recent book entitled \\"Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew\\" (see it here on Amazon.com). And I have done extensive research on my own into the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi documents. So I was in a position to read Brown's controversial novel without any problem, simply as a piece of exciting fiction to be enjoyed for its own sake, while dismissing the author's historical claims as the invention of an imaginative novelist. <br />  <br />It is all too true, unfortunately, that most people get their knowledge of historical events from motion pictures, television, and, of course, fictional books. But when it comes to novels which have a religious theme, particularly a novel which claims to be historically accurate but isn't, the misinformation generated can be particularly deadly, both intellectually and emotionally. Understandably, many traditional Christians will be upset with the allegations put forth by Brown's novel. Professor Ehrman's book addresses the historical inaccuracies in Brown's novel directly, providing the facts and insights of scholarship without demeaning the novel itself as a source of leisure enjoyment for those of us who like to read fictional works of mystery and international intrigue. Dan Brown's primary mistake, in my opinion, was to make the claim at the outset that his novel was based on historical fact. Had he not done that, I suspect there would be no problem or controversy over the content of his work. I have read a number of his novels and enjoyed them immensely. I certainly won't desert him as a reader just because of this single faux pas. <br />  <br />The basic questions that Professor Ehrman answers in his analysis of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" include: What role did the emperor Constantine play in early Christianity and was he responsible for the formation of the New Testament canon?; What role did women play in the development of and practices of early Christianity and was there a feminine factor which was suppressed in later Christianity?; Were the Dead Sea Scrolls a collection of Christian documents (which Brown claims)?; Was Jesus married and were Jewish men in antiquity \\"condemned\\" for being celibate?; Was Jesus married to Mary Magdalene?; Did they have a child which was born after Jesus was crucified?; Is there a royal line of descent from Jesus and Mary Magdalene, perpetuated by the birth of their daughter, which has come down to us after almost two thousand years and still exists today?; Is Mary Magdalene indeed the real \\"Holy Grail,\\" being the font of the seed of Jesus?; Has a secret society, called the Priory of Sion, created in antiquity and still in existence today, fought to protect this secret of the \\"Holy Grail? These are merely a few examples of the many questions that Professor Ehrman deals with in his book. <br />  <br />If you have read or intend to read Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" or \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail,\\" by Michael Baigent, et al, I really suggest that you have a copy of Bart Ehrman's \\"Truth and Fiction in the Da Vinci Code\\" by your side. Its presentation of the real historical truth will not detract from your enjoyment of Brown's novel or Baigent's historical \\"speculation.\\" It will, I guarantee, allow you to evaluate properly the \\"facts\\" offered in both Brown and Baigent and help you to place the historical realities about early Christianity and attitudes within early Christianity in the appropriate context to which they are entitled. This book is highly recommended!	2004-10-31

Here is a book I can wholeheartedly recommend to everyone without any hesitation. For those who are interested in attaining and maintaining good health in all its aspects, I would even go so far as to say this book is essential reading and a necessary resource to keep close at hand. If you even entertain the possibility of living forever, then this book is a must for you. The authors are, without a doubt, knowledgeable about the topics of which they write and provide literally hundreds of facts, proposals, insights, suggestions, and recommendations regarding everything from developments in medical nanotechnology and biotechnology to disease prevention, nutrition, food preparation, living a healthful lifestyle, and, in fact, more information than you will assimilate during a first reading. <br />  <br />The authors are well-known within their fields of expertise. Ray Kurzweil, a recipient of the National Medal of Technology and an inductee into the Inventors Hall of Fame, is one of the world's leading inventors, thinkers, and futurists and the author of three previous books on technology. Terry Grossman M.D., the founder and medical director of the Frontier Medical Institute in Denver, Colorado, a leading longevity clinic, is certified in anti-aging medicine and lectures internationally on matters related to longevity and anti-aging strategies. These two experts, one in technology and one in medical science, have joined together to write about how you can \\"live long enough to live forever.\\" <br />  <br />While I endorse and highly recommend \\"Fantastic Voyage,\\" the subtitle of the book presents a problem for me. The very idea of \\"living forever\\" is a proposition with which I am not entirely comfortable. I am philosophically oriented both by training and by disposition and I have to wrestle with this question: \\"Is living forever a suitable and desirable goal for any human being?\\" I believe this is fundamentally an ethical question and at this moment I cannot answer it,at least for myself, because I haven't had time to consider it in depth and in all its possible ramifications. To be frank, I haven't really given any thought to it until reading this book. So now, thanks to the authors, I'll have to explore this problem. But I think it's an important issue to raise and debate, particularly considering that, while we may be able to prolong life indefinitely in a physical sense, there are psychological, sociological, and political factors which must also be considered. <br />  <br />Once we put this matter aside for further thought and discussion, the authors do indeed take us on a fantastic voyage into the world of cutting-edge technology, a place where modern biology, information science, and what is called \\"nanotechnology\\" intersect and impact each other. Their discussion of \\"nanobots\\" is especially interesting. These are robots, the size of blood cells, built from molecules placed in our bodies and bloodstream to enhance every aspect of our lives. Nanobots, suggest the authors, will even be used for surgery. For example, teams \\"of millions of nanobots will be able to restructure bones and muscles, destroy unwanted growths such as tumors on a cell-by-cell basis, and clear arteries while restructuring them out of healthy tissue.\\" This especially caught my attention, as one who suffered a heart attack a couple of years ago and had to undergo an emergency angioplasty. If a nanobot could continually keep my arteries clear, I'd be more than happy to let it do so! <br />  <br />But correcting a medical problem after the damage has been done is not the major thrust of this book. I would guess that more than ninety-five percent of \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" is devoted to preventing disease, promoting good health, and dealing with the aging process. (I should warn the reader that there is some discussion of chemistry involved here, but I found that one can skip through the various chemical formulas discussed and not miss anything vital to understanding the point being made.) In line with the major thrusts of the book, the authors present \\"Three Bridges\\" which are \\"emerging transformations in technology that will usher in powerful new tools to expand your health and human powers.\\" <br />  <br />The First Bridge is \\"Ray & Terry's Longevity Program\\" which includes \\"present-day therapies and guidance that will enable you to remain healthy long enough to take full advantage of the construction of the Second Bridge.\\" The reader will learn about carbohydrates and the glycemic load, the importance of fat and protein, why the modern diet is out of balance, how to eat nutritionally, why sugar is the \\"white Satan,\\" the real cause of heart disease and how to prevent it, and much, much more. The Second Bridge is the \\"Biotechnology Revolution\\" where \\"we learn the genetic and protein codes of our biology\\" and \\"the means of turning off disease and aging while we turn on our full human potential.\\" The reader will learn about gene expression, somatic gene therapy, recombinant technology, therapeutic cloning, and how human aging can be reversed. The Third Bridge is the \\"Nanotechnology-Artificial Intelligence Revolution\\" which will \\"enable us to rebuild our bodies and brains at the molecular level.\\" The reader will learn about programmable blood, nanopower, nanosurgery, \\"intelligent\\" cells, and a lot more. <br />  <br />I could go on and on; I've only scratched the surface of the information provided in this interesting and valuable book. Kurzweil and Grossman are to be commended for making this important information available to the public, written in an easy and understandable style, with recommendations that the reader can implement immediately. At the end of the book they provide a page of resources and contact information and the standard index to topics. More importantly, however, they provide over sixty pages of notes, references, and citations so the reader can consult the primary sources for more detail. I wish more authors would do that. <br />  <br />This is a serious book to be read once and then consulted continuously for its suggestions and recommendations. But, now, the real question: Do I really want to live forever? Well, let me think about that for a few years!	2004-10-24

If you're a football fan but don't know anything about physics, this book will teach you some things about physics you probably don't know but will enjoy learning. If you're a student of physics but don't know anything about football, this book will teach you some things about football you probably don't know but will enjoy learning. But if you're both a football fan and a student of physics well, then, this book will be a delightful read for you and you will learn some things about the \\"physics of football\\" you may not know but should know, if for no other reason than you can now show your family and friends how the principles and methods of physics are applicable to a popular human activity and one of our favorite pastimes. Now, don't get me wrong. You don't have to be a football fan or a student of physics to enjoy this book. In fact, if you don't fall into either of these categories, you may enjoy reading the book even more because you'll be learning about two unfamiliar subjects instead of just one. Consider it an exciting journey into the unknown. <br />  <br />The author of \\"Football Physics: The Science of the Game\\" is eminently qualified to write the book. Dr. Timothy Gay played football at Caltech and earned a doctorate in atomic physics at the University of Chicago, and it is obvious from his writing that he remains a loyal fan of the game. Furthermore, there is no question about his talent in applying the principles of physics to an activity that most of us probably never realized had much in the way of scientific principles attached to it. Well, I was certainly surprised to learn just how much physics is involved in a game that hundreds of thousands of fans watch each week during the football season. And I suggest that all those high-school football players out there might profit immensely from taking some time out of practice to spend some time with Dr. Gay's book. <br />  <br />Initially, we are introduced to Newton's First Law. Don't recall who IsaacNewton was? No matter. You'll know who he was and why he is important before you get to Chapter Two. Anyway, Newton's First Law simply says that \\"mass wants to continue doing what it's doing, whether it's at rest or in motion.\\" What's that got to do with the game of football? Well, for one thing, it \\"provides the reasoning behind why quarterback sneak plays work if well timed.\\" There's more involved here, of course, but you'll have to read the book to find out what. Then, there is Newton's Second Law which states that \\"the force applied to an object is the product of the object's mass and its acceleration.\\" When you think of \\"mass\\" in the context of football, think Refrigerator Perry. The author explains how this great football player can be used to illustrate this second physical law. You'll also learn a lot about acceleration, speed, and velocity and why these are important to a scientific understanding of football. Finally, there is Newton's Third Law which says that \\"whenever two objects collide, no matter what their individual masses, no matter how fast they're going, they always exert the same amount of force on each other, but in opposite directions.\\" Are you beginning to see how this might apply to football? Think of all those objects colliding at and beyond the line of scrimmage. At this point in the book, by the way, we haven't even reached Chapter Two yet. <br />  <br />Since it is impossible for me to even begin to condense what the rest of the book holds, just let me tell you that you'll learn much about the \\"science\\" of blocking and tackling, about what effect altitude has on the flight of a kicked ball, about the ins and outs of football gear (do you know how helmets work?), what scientific principles are involved in kicking and passing a football, how and why the advent of artificial playing surfaces has changed the game, and a lot more. Do you know anything about the science behind the so-called \\"West Coast Offense\\" which was perfected by Joe Montana and Jerry Rice? No? You will after you read \\"Football Physics.\\" <br />  <br />This is a serious book, to be sure. After all, it is about a basic empirical science, physics, and the application of its principles and methods to a human activity. But it is a fun book, too. It is entertaining and easy to read and understand. Furthermore, Dr. Gay has provided numerous diagrams and charts to help illustrate the principles of physics as they apply to football. There are also some classic photographs of famous NLF players in action which aid in visualizing certain important points that the author is trying to make. Also included are a bibliography and notes, as well as a handy index, which even includes page references to the illustrations and photographs. <br />  <br />The author also provides an appendix where he takes a more in-depth look at some important physics concepts and tools, and how they apply within the context of the game of football, including the Cartesian grid, the Pythagorean theorem, and vectors. Students of philosophy and mathematics please pay attention! You'll discover that philosophy and mathematics can be very practical pursuits indeed. Those who are not familiar with either philosophy or mathematics will be surprised to learn how things considered so \\"abstract\\" can also be so \\"practical.\\" <br />  <br />Without hesitation, I recommend \\"Football Physics\\" to all readers who like to explore new territory or investigate new fields of inquiry. You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy it. You don't have to be a student of physics to enjoy it. You just have to be an inquisitive reader who desires to learn more about how the discoveries of science impact our ordinary activities or, conversely, how our ordinary activities are better illuminated by understanding them in the light of scientific principles.	2004-10-05
US	52858812	R1A1YJA8OMRVDH	1588321002	258195304	Return to the One: Plotinus's Guide to God-Realization	Books	5	147	147	N	N	Very helpful for understanding the philosophy of Plotinus	The philosophic and religious thought of Plotinus, a third-century philosopher and mystic, was primarily responsible for initiating the philosophical movement we call Neoplatonism and was an important influence on the development of early Christian thought. Plotinus' writings were published by Porphyry, who was one of his students, in six books of nine sections and was called the \\"Enneads.\\" Plotinus' ideas can be very difficult for many people to grasp, especially in this modern age which is so beset with empiricism and materialism and looks on mysticism and religious meditation with a skeptical eye. We are fortunate now to have Brian Hines, a longtime serious student of meditation, metaphysics, and philosophy, write a book in easily-understandable language to explain the many concepts, some of them very obscure, that Plotinus presents in his \\"Enneads.\\" <br />  <br />The book, entitled \\"Return to the One: Plotinus's Guide to God-Realization,\\" is, however, more than just a theoretical explanation of Plotinus' thought. It is also a practical guide to the procedures that Plotinus suggests will enable an individual to accomplish what he or she really longs for, which is to return to the \\"One,\\" which, as the author points out, \\"may be thought of as 'God,' if this more familiar term for ultimate reality is stripped of its personal or theistic connotations.\\" The One or God, according to Plotinus, is not only the supreme inconceivable reality but also the principle of all realities. <br />  <br />The invisible world as well as the visible world, man included, is nothing other than a derivation or emanation from the One. The One is true happiness for man; but as man cannot reach full knowledge of the One by reason, so also he cannot possess happiness of himself; his intellectual knowledge is not sufficient. Man needs a superior help in order to reach the One and to possess the One. This superior help comes from the One who, beyond all forces of reason, manifests itself to man, and makes him happy. Plotinus calls this \\"ecstasy.\\" Toward this all his speculation points. The monistic metaphysics of Plotinus may be considered in two ways: as progression downward from the One (or God) to the world in the divine emanations; and upward toward the world of the One (or God) through morality. Emanation is marked by four degrees: matter, world soul, Nous, and God or the One. All the degrees of being partake of the divinity, but in a different way (the monism of Plotinus' thought). <br />  <br />Now if all this sounds a bit strange or alien to you, that is understandable; mystical philosophies are not much in vogue today. Plotinus might have difficulty in our contemporary world getting enough university students to register for his course on \\"A Guide to God-Realization.\\" I suspect that the closest we have been in this country to something akin to Plotinus' work in the academic arena would be when Josiah Royce, that great, but unappreciated, American philosopher, teaching at Harvard toward the end of the nineteenth century, was the major expositor of metaphysical idealism and monism. But, if you are intrigued by the mysteries and obscurities of Plotinus' philosophy and want to learn more, then I would suggest you can't go wrong by using Brian Hines' book as a resource to guide you on your way toward understanding. <br />  <br />First, he introduces the reader to some preliminaries, providing some background on Plotinus, discussing philosophy as a way of life and the making of a leap of faith, and, very useful to the beginning student of Plotinus' thought, the author provides some tips on reading the writing of Plotinus based on the author's own experience. Second, Hines proceeds to explain four main concepts: The One, The Many, The Soul's Descent, and The Soul's Return. An understanding of each of these ideas is essential to understanding Plotinus at all. The author, however, seems to recognize that many readers will be unfamiliar with formal philosophical analyses or with matters of mystical thought and practice. Thus, his descriptions, explanations, and interpretations are written in plain, ordinary language without any of the \\"techno-speak\\" which is the curse of so much of philosophy written today. Lastly, a final section of the book is a wrap-up area where the author does some summarizing and draws some conclusions from what has been said already, and discusses a \\"science\\" of spirituality, Neoplatonism and its relationship to Christianity, and the legacy of Plato and Plotinus. <br />  <br />I called this book a \\"resource\\" earlier in this review, but I did not mean to imply that it was a text you consulted from time to time when you needed it. The book can easily be and should initially be read through from beginning to end. What I meant by applying the term \\"resource\\" to this work is that the author provides some important material at the end of the book, material which is not always provided by authors to help their readers go beyond the text they've just read. Hines provides notes to the references he cites throughout the book, as well as a bibliography and the necessary index. That's pretty standard stuff for most books, although not all authors writing today necessarily provide all these helps. <br />  <br />Hines, however, has gone beyond merely providing this standard stuff for the reader. He has a section called \\"Suggestions for further reading\\" which could well be a model for authors of potentially difficult nonfiction books. He not only suggests books for further reading; he breaks them down into five categories: Translations; Non-scholarly overviews; Scholarly yet accessible books; Seriously scholarly treatises; and Related works. The books in each category are then commented on, quite often in some detail. What a boon to the reader! I wish more writers would do this. <br />  <br />I highly recommend \\"Return to the One\\" to all those interested in the philosophy of Plotinus, the general history ofWestern philosophy, religious philosophy, or mystical philosophy. The subject is interesting and important and Brian Hines' prose is crisp, concise, and easily understood.	2004-10-04
US	52858812	RFR1KVHIMSB6N	0805074562	393014403	On Intelligence	Books	4	357	452	N	N	Important and relevant...but be a critical reader	Jeff Hawkins is an entrepreneur and computer expert, responsible for the invention of the popular device known as the PalmPilot, as well as the Treo smart phone and other gadgets. He is also interested in the human brain and how it functions. So it should be no surprise that he has chosen to bring together his two main interests -- computers and the human brain -- in a book entitled \\"On Intelligence\\" which presents a new theory about how the brain works and how we can finally build \\"intelligent\\" machines. <br />  <br />Of course, discussions about computers, artificial intelligence (AI), and the possibility of building intelligent machines have been plentiful for many decades. The English mathematician Alan Turing, an early developer and innovator in the field of digital computers, best known for the Turing machine and the Turing test (both concerned with the relation between computation and mind), proposed a criterion in 1950 which would determine whether or not a machine can \\"think.\\" A machine can think, he said, if its replies to questions are indistinguishable from those of a human being. With the declaration that \\"the human brain is just another computer,\\" the field of artificial intelligence was launched. <br />  <br />Turing's declaration, however, became controversial and was criticized by both scientists and philosophers, especially those working in the areas of learning psychology and philosophy of mind. Turing's position, now known as \\"strong\\" AI, was especially criticized by John Searle, a philosopher and cognitive scientist who created a thought experiment, called the \\"Chinese Room\\" argument, which demonstrated that, while the computing device could indeed reply to questions in such a way that made it indistinguishable from a human being, it had no \\"understanding\\" regarding its replies, no \\"meaning\\" was attached to its replies, and it was not really behaving in the same way that a human being does. Turing's test was shown to be faulty and misleading. <br />  <br />In this book, Hawkins goes beyond Turing's ideas and Searle's discussion of the matter, and argues that intelligent machines can and probably will be built, but that a basic understanding of how the brain actually operates is fundamental to the development of such machines. The brain is not a computer, the author claims, but a memory system which makes predictions based on memories resulting from the interaction of events and their relationships. \\"Intelligence\\" is defined by Hawkins as \\"the capacity of the brain to predict the future by analogy to the past.\\" And the first necessity on the way to building an intelligent machine is to understand how the human brain actually works, a subject to which he devotes most of his book. The reader will learn a lot about the evolution of the animate brain, including a lengthy discussion of neural networks and how the neocortex works. The author provides credible information and a compelling framework with which to understand brain activity. <br />  <br />Be that as it may, \\"On Intelligence\\" is not, despite its arresting title, a treatise on \\"human\\" intelligence. First, and I am not one who usually quibbles over definitions, his definition of \\"intelligence\\" is too limiting and his book should really be titled \\"On Animal Intelligence\\" or \\"On Machine Intelligence\\" or, maybe better, \\"On Computer Intelligence.\\" I would argue that when it comes to \\"human\\" intelligence there is a lot more involved than merely \\"the capacity of the brain to predict the future by analogy to the past.\\" In a \\"strict\\" sense of the term, human intelligence is an activity of the \\"intellect,\\" that cognitive faculty of the mind as it operates at higher abstract and conceptual levels, and thus refers to universal ideas, judgments, and reasoning. These \\"intellectual\\" activities, which we philosophers in the classical realistic tradition call \\"intellection,\\" are virtually ignored by Hawkins. Yet these are the essential activities which make us membersof the class of human beings. <br />  <br />Second, Hawkins concludes his discussion of consciousness and creativity (Chapter 7) with an interesting paragraph. He states: <br />  <br />\\"By now, I hope I have convinced you that mind is just a label of what the brain does. It isn't a separate thing that manipulates or coexists with the cells in the brain. Neurons are just cells. There is no mystical force that makes individual nerve cells or collections of nerve cells behave in ways that differ from what they would normally do.\\" <br />  <br />No, I am sorry he has not convinced me that \\"mind\\" is merely a \\"label\\" for what the brain does. Actually, he never defines the term \\"mind,\\" so it's hard to know what he is really saying. The traditional definition of \\"mind\\" as \\"the conscious knowing subject or the conscious knowing part of the subject\\" seems to me to be pretty clear and has nothing to do with a \\"mystical force.\\" It seems obvious to me that \\"I\\" am not my \\"brain.\\" My brain is a physical organ which permits me to have an \\"I\\" (ego) in the first place, but I would argue that my \\"I\\" is not a label for what my brain does. <br />  <br />Third, if I am to infer that he equates \\"mind\\" and/or \\"intellect\\" with \\"brain,\\" then his basic thesis regarding human intelligence rests on plain old-fashioned metaphysical materialism and, probably, old-school psychological behaviorism. I would argue that both these philosophical positions have pretty much been discounted today, as these \\"theories\\" have been unable to explain and account for the vast array of human activities, both objective and subjective, which all members of the human species experience in ordinary life. <br />  <br />Nevertheless, even with its shortcomings, I found the book an interesting read and would recommend it to all those interested in the subject of \\"intelligent\\" machines and the future of the digital computer. I just want to warn those readers who may take Hawkins uncritically that there are some philosophical implications here that are important and which the author does not directly address. It is well-written and most readers with any \\"human\\" intelligence should find it an easy-to-understand discussion of a relevant topic.	2004-09-20

Graham Allison is one of America's leading experts on nuclear weapons and national security. He has served in the Department of Defense as assistant secretary of defense for policy and plans, is the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. In other words, when this man speaks and writes on an issue where he has the expertise, it is prudent, very prudent, to pay attention to what he has to say. And he has a lot to say in his new book entitled \\"Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe.\\" <br />  <br />I am a great fan of suspense thrillers and novels about spies, espionage, and international crises and disasters. How I wish that Allison's book was just another of my exciting leisure-time fictional entertainments! But, unfortunately, this book is nonfiction: a serious, indeed extremely serious, and sober, discussion of the threat we face called \\"nuclear terrorism.\\" For example, one \\"dirty bomb,\\" which simply consists of conventional explosives dispersing radioactive materials, exploded in downtown Manhattan, would make the island uninhabitable for years and result in many thousands of deaths from the immediate blast, from radiation poisoning over time, and from the immediate panic it would cause at the outset. And note: these radioactive materials are readily available in many medical and industrial facilities and, of course, explosives are so easy to obtain that they often fall into the hands of knowledgeable teenagers. <br />  <br />Scary? Of course. But that's not the worst possibility that Allison discusses in his book. Just suppose the bomb is a ten-kiloton nuclear weapon and it is smuggled into New York City, not all that difficult to do since not every package container or usable vehicle can be searched or inspected. On the other hand, maybe it's already there, smuggled in long before this, just waiting to be activated. What would happen if it was detonated? Well, according to Allison, if the bomb were set off in Times Square, up to a million people would probably die instantly. Thousands upon thousands more would be killed by collapsing buildings, fires, and the effects of radiation. Life and living, as New Yorkers have known it, would be changed forever in a matter of milliseconds. <br />  <br />If you think it would be too difficult for a terrorist group to build a nuclear weapon, think again. According to Allison, the only real difficulty to creating a nuclear weapon is getting one's hands on the fissionable material necessary to produce the nuclear explosion. This material is highly enriched uranium (HEU) or plutonium. Think that it's almost impossible for a would-be terrorist to obtain such material? Consider these facts the author has uncovered: In 1993, a Russian Navy captain entered a shipyard through an unguarded gate, broke into a building used to store nuclear submarine fuel, and stole three pieces of reactor core containing about ten pounds of HEU; In 1994, Czech police seized over eight pounds of HEU in the city of Prague, which was found inside a metal container in the back-seat of a car parked on a side street; In 2000, four Georgian nationals were arrested with about two pounds of HEU outside Batumi, the capital of the chaotic Adzhariya Autonomous Republic in Georgia. These are just a few examples. Allison provides a lot more, even showing how such material could be stolen within the United States at certain nuclear storage sites. <br />  <br />After a chapter devoted to showing how easy it would be to acquire fissionable material, Allison devotes the next chapter to the question: \\"When could terrorists launch the first nuclear attack?\\" You'll be surprised at the answer, I guarantee it. The reader should pay particular attention to the sub-topic in this chapter about \\"Building It Yourself.\\" The author even includes diagrams for a simple \\"gun-type\\" nuclear bomb and an implosion-type nuclear bomb. Is he being irresponsible? No, these diagrams are easily available to anyone elsewhere! Following this discussion, in the next chapter, Allison discusses the question, \\"How could terrorists deliver a nuclear weapon to its target?\\" A number of scenarios are offered and he shows how easy it would be to smuggle a nuclear device into the United States and, of course, into New York City or anywhere else. Now go back and read paragraphs two and three in this review. <br />  <br />So, is it hopeless? The first half of Allison's book would lead one to believe that this is the case. But the author spends the second half of his book arguing that nuclear terrorism is preventable. And he provides a framework, a schematic of sorts, for a program of policies to prevent nuclear terrorism. First, there must be the \\"Three No's\\": No loose nukes, no new nascent nukes, and no new nuclear weapons states. Second, there must be the \\"Seven Yeses\\": Making the prevention of nuclear terrorism an absolute national priority, fighting a strategically focused war on terrorism, conducting a humble foreign policy, building a global alliance against nuclear terrorism, creating the intelligence capabilities required for success in the war on nuclear terrorism, dealing with dirty bombs, and constructing a multilayered defense. For the details of these no's and yeses, you'll just have to read the book. I think you'll find them reasonable and necessary. While Allison suggests a blueprint for prevention, it will ultimately be up to Americans and their government, hopefully in accord and alliance with other peoples of the world and their governments, to implement the policies he recommends. <br />  <br />\\"Nuclear Terrorism\\" is a book which needs to be read by every person who is concerned by the unprecedented threats which surround our lives today in a world which stands on the brink of a possible nuclear disaster.

James Carroll is a best-selling author of both fiction and nonfiction books and a winner of the National Book Award. The son of an Air Force general with whom he had his own political disagreements, Carroll was ordained in the Catholic Church as a member of the Paulist order, a community of priests known for their public communication skills and media savvy, and became active in the antiwar movement. Eventually leaving the priesthood to become a full-time writer, he also lectures widely on the issues of war and peace and on religious topics, especially those involving Christian, Jewish, and Islamic relations. I mention these few important points about his background merely to show that the author of this critique of President Bush's current foreign policy is no lightweight and Carroll cannot easily be dismissed by those who may disagree with his analyses and interpretations. <br /> <br />\\"Crusade: Chronicles of an Unjust War\\" is a collection of Carroll's columns which appeared in The Boston Globe from September 2001 through March 2004 and, the title of the book notwithstanding, his writing goes far beyond the topic of war to include discussions of religious power and theology, domestic policy issues, capital punishment, the separation of church and state, and even a damning criticism of Mel Gibson's movie \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" Although the author and I are not exactly at the same place on the political spectrum, I must admit that his analyses and criticisms are fair and well-reasoned and do not constitute just another noisy and mindless rant from a left-wing apologist. In fact, there are a number of his positions regarding contemporary issues with which I am in agreement. <br /> <br />Let's take the current \\"war on terror\\" and its most recent manifestation, the war on Iraq, which is, after all, the major focus of Carroll's book even though he covers other topics. When President Bush announced the beginning of the actual conflict, after stating all the allegedjustifications for a preemptive attack against the Saddam Hussein regime, I, like so many of my fellow Americans, rallied to the \\"cause,\\" at least morally and intellectually, and settled in front of the television to watch the overthrow of an extremely brutal and fundamentally inhumane individual and his cohorts. While I subscribe to the concept that any war is a terrible waste of necessary resources -- physical, financial, and human -- a war may nevertheless be \\"just,\\" provided it is a defensive action against clear and present aggression and constitutes a last resort after other, more moderate, means to resolve the matter have been exhausted. <br /> <br />Carroll's position is that the war on Iraq was an \\"unjust\\" war. I may now have to agree with him on this specific point. It is obvious to me, as it has become to many others who initially supported the action, that the original officially-declared rationalizations for the war have not subsequently been shown to be justified. There were apparently intelligence failures all over the place with plenty of blame to go around. Furthermore, and this is especially disturbing to me now as it apparently is to the author of this book, I must question whether there were other motivations in play here than merely to remove a brutal dictator from his house of horrors. Carroll raises this issue, also, along with the whole matter of modern American \\"imperialism\\" and the potentially disastrous consequences of an American foreign policy which seems to have run amuck. <br /> <br />Another topic, unfortunately only briefly raised by Carroll, is the death penalty and America's seeming enthusiasm for this barbaric practice. The author, a modern liberal, and I, a classical liberal, would have no difficulty joining forces to criticize capital punishment as a policy and to seek its abolition. While my opposition is basically related to its contradiction of the principle of an \\"inalienable\\" right to life as expressed in America's founding document, Carroll proposes a more practical and immediate problem with the death penalty as it relates to the war on terrorism. He suggests that \\"the American death penalty is a serious obstacle to a fully effective war on terrorism\\" because other countries, such as Germany and England and possibly other members of the European Union (which prohibits capital punishment), may refuse to hand over terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, \\"without assurances that the death penalty will be waived.\\" I agree with Carroll on this point. The Bush administration, as far as I know, has not responded to this issue in public. <br /> <br />This is a book not to be read in one sitting, but to be read in fits and spurts. Publications of this type, reprintings of essays without a logical common thread binding them all together, can be difficult to handle all at one time. Regardless of the structure of the text, Carroll stands by his opinions and beliefs and presents some pretty persuasive arguments. He raises some important questions and problems and we are forced to pause and think about answers and solutions. The author writes with the passion of a committed believer and pragmatic activist. While there are many issues about which Carroll and I would argue, particularly with regard to his analysis and interpretation, I would suggest that even the most pro-war or hawkish political partisan will be challenged by some of Carroll's analyses and opinions. Certainly, the author is one of the most important voices in today's world speaking out about the direction that America is taking in world affairs. He should be heard and his opinions debated. This book should be read by the largest possible audience. Regardless of where one sits on the political spectrum, there is much to learn in this book and much to think about. Highly recommended to those on the Left and the Right and, of course, to the majority of Americans who consider themselves to be independent thinkers without definitive ties to either side.	2004-08-30
US	52858812	REAZYX12I8WDF	1579547990	640028495	Man's Guide to a Civilized Divorce: How to Divorce with Grace, a Little Class, and a Lot of Common Sense	Books	5	21	22	N	N	A Needed Reference in Today's Society!	A divorce is rarely a pleasant experience. And during the past several decades, more and more Americans are going through just that experience. Many factors are involved in the increase in divorces in the United States, but it seems today that the most common complaint of the spouses involved is that one of the parties to a marriage is no longer happy with the other partner. This is in contrast to the usual complaints in the past of adultery, desertion, abuse, alcoholism, and so forth, which were the main reasons for one of the spouses (usually the wife) to file for a divorce. Since the 1970s and the beginning of the &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce concept, divorces have been easier to obtain and the divorce statistics have risen. But a divorce, regardless of the cause or causes, remains a painful experience for most people.<BR> <BR>This book by lawyer and human behavior expert Sam Margulies is primarily for men, hence its title. It is designed as a guidebook for men who may be facing a divorce or thinking about a divorce. Tragic and unpleasant as getting a divorce may be, Margulies argues that it is possible to have a &quot;civilized&quot; divorce without the rancor and pain usually accompanying that process. What? A civilized divorce? Yes, that is exactly what the author proposes and he shows how to go about it through the procedure known as &quot;mediation.&quot; The advantage of mediation in a divorce proceeding is that, for the most part, mediation keeps the process largely out of the law courts and generally out of the hands of attorneys who depend on an adversarial method for resolving problems.<BR> <BR>According to Margulies, &quot;The divorce mediation movement . . . began in the late 1970s when a group of reform-minded lawyers began to collaborate with psychologists and family therapists who were appalled by the carnage they were witnessing in the divorce courts.&quot; Over the past ten years, this movement has acquired momentum although it was, in the beginning, received with great hostility by many members of the legal community. The author, who has acted as a mediator himself in thousands of divorce cases over the years, has organized this guidebook for those who seek, then, what he calls a &quot;civilized&quot; divorce, beginning with how to choose a mediator in the first place -- and he includes specific pointers on what to look for in a mediator when searching for one.<BR> <BR>A &quot;good&quot; divorce can be distinguished from a bad one, says Margulies, by considering the following six criteria: (1) an emotional divorce occurs, that is, the parties are no longer emotionally tied to one another through negative emotions; (2) both parties rebuild their lives, that is, they have succeeded in building new lives for themselves; (3) both parties think the agreement is fair; (4) the former spouses are able to cooperate as parents; (5) the children are comfortable in each household; and (6) the former spouses can resolve disputes themselves or through further mediation, not having to resort to the legal system regarding problems in the future. If this sounds like an idealized situation, an impossible dream, an unachievable goal, the author assures us it is not, and he provides dozens of practical illustrations based on real people and real divorces with which he has been associated.<BR> <BR>Although Margulies devotes an entire chapter to an overview of divorce law, the major thrust of his book is providing advice on settling a divorce through mediation, without getting into an unnecessary and painful legal mess. There is, for example, practical advice on how to negotiate with the other spouse, how to handle the important matters of child support and alimony, a whole chapter on budgets and possible financial entanglements, and even advice about the dos and don'ts of dating after the divorce. He gets very specific about what self-defeating behaviors to avoid during the mediation process, such as shaming and blaming, acting helpless and passive, being threatening and intimidating, making personal attacks, and cutting off communication with the other party. Furthermore, Margulies provides positive tips for helping the negotiation procedure to be successful, beginning with the initial invitation to your spouse to negotiate through mediation, and continuing with tidbits like &quot;listen more than you talk&quot;; &quot;affirm conciliatory gestures&quot; -- when your wife agrees to something you want, it is important to affirm her for doing so; &quot;pay attention to your tone&quot;; if you are attacked personally by your spouse, don't take the bait; acknowledge your mutual interests and focus on minimizing differences; and, above all, think on the future, not on the past.<BR> <BR>This is exactly the book I wish someone had written and I had read when I went through my divorce over twenty-five years ago. According to the criteria for a &quot;good&quot; divorce listed by Margulies in the early part of his book, my divorce process was not good and the divorce was certainly not &quot;civilized.&quot; The advice given in this book might have made a real difference if it had been available. Although I have always thought (and continue to think) that divorce is a terrible experience for anyone to go through, the fact is that it is a possible reality for all married couples and an all-too-common component of the American social fabric in this postmodern age. As tragic and undesirable as divorce may be, at least it can be rendered less painful and, yes!, even &quot;civilized,&quot; if the advice in Margulies' book is taken to heart and seriously followed. Highly recommended for those (especially the male of the species) who may be faced with the reality of a divorce and also for those within the legal system who may be advising divorcing clients. There is a better way and Margulies offers it to the reader in an easy-to-read text and format.	2004-06-29

Since I am by training a philosopher and not a player in the market nor an expert in matters of business and finance, I am going to concern myself briefly with a &quot;philosophical&quot; view of the work. I will leave it to others to discuss whether or not the tactics and strategies suggested by Dorsey will actually prove profitable in the financial markets.<BR> <BR>What does the scholarly discipline of philosophy have to do with Woody Dorsey's book about the marketplace and financial investing? Well, in a word, everything. Two of the three main branches of philosophy, specifically metaphysics and epistemology, help to provide the grounding for behavioral trading and Dorsey's Triunity Theory which analyzes and suggests the methods and strategies for profitable market investing. This is, in fact, a perfect example of what is called &quot;applied philosophy,&quot; that is, the application of philosophical knowledge and principles to practical situations. And Dorsey is upfront about this. For instance, he states that his basic theory, the Triunity Theory, &quot;is a practical philosophy of market behavior, which is based on the simple but profound structure of man himself.&quot; Furthermore, Triunity Theory &quot;is a practical philosophy which can be very profitable.&quot; Dorsey suggests that his theory is both philosophical, regarding its foundations and implications, and practical, regarding its applicability to real situations and its profitability.<BR> <BR>Triunity Theory is based on the proposition that we &quot;have a brain composed of three distinct developmental levels: reptilian, mammalian, and specifically human. These three separate brain functions relate to emotion, thought, and action.&quot; The Triunity Theory itself contains three components: Mood, Mind, and Body, and these relate to the three separate brain functions. &quot;Psychologicals&quot; are the Mood of the market and draw on psychological knowledge. Financial traders need to explore what are called emotions in the financial market. The primary thrust of behavioral finance is to acknowledge the irrational aspects of investing. &quot;Fundamentals&quot; are transient investment themes that make up the Mind of the market; they are everything we think about the market. Behavioral traders need to be cognizant of the role that bias, propaganda or spin plays in the financial markets, and must be aware of the symbolic information in the marketplace and the media and incorporate this as part of their trading strategy. &quot;Technicals&quot; make up the Body of the market and represent the physical manifestations of the market's action, such as price, volume, and volatility. To understand and to predict the market requires the practice of all three parts of the Triunity Theory and the behavioral trader &quot;must never draw a significant conclusion based on the metrics of only one of Triunity Theory's components.&quot;<BR> <BR>The new investing paradigm described by Dorsey is called behavioral finance. It is the union of psychology and economics, applying ideas derived from both to trading in the financial markets. The role of irrationality in financial markets, says the author, has always been ignored by economics. At the heart of behavioral finance is the study of the emotional brain and &quot;The nominal premise of behavioral finance is to reject the limitations of rationality and embrace the potential of irrationality.&quot; Thus far, according to Dorsey, behavioral thought has focused on &quot;identifying the innumerable irrational quirks, fetishes and foibles, or human habits, which are aspects of human nature.&quot; Since the markets are more psychological than logical, the behavioral trader, to be successful,&quot;must be prepared for, and acknowledge the role of, irrationality in the financial markets.&quot;<BR> <BR>There are many metaphysical and epistemological ideas, principles, and implications involved in Triunity Theory and in the methodologies of behavioral trading. At various points throughout the book, philosophers, both ancient and modern, are referred to and some of the most important and traditionally debated philosophical problems are discussed. Moreover, their importance to contemporary financial practices is pointed out. In Chapter 8, for example, Dorsey brings up the famous body-mind problem which was mainly created by Ren Descartes in the 17th century. Descartes maintained that the Mind was most important and the body merely a lesser reality. What does this have to do with financial trading? Listen to Dorsey: &quot;Descartes came down on the side that the mind is immortal and immutable compared to the body. This presumption is at the heart of the fallacy of 'rationalism.' On Wall Street they still think that the Mind, or Investment Themes, rule everything. They have always dismissed the body or, the 'Technicals,' just because Descartes effectively told them to.&quot; Then there is the problem of perception. Dorsey presents Plato's famous allegory of the cave, which suggests we live in a world of appearances. What do we know and how do we know it? In the context of behavioral trading, do we &quot;know&quot; the market? The &quot;question of perception and interpretation is at the heart of behavioral finance.&quot;<BR> <BR>And there is so much more discussed in this adventure into applied philosophy: the idea of the &quot;random walk,&quot; chaos theory, the invisible hand, Thomas Kuhn's concept of paradigm shift, complexity theory, fractal geometry, and even a Buddhist koan. Besides Plato and Descartes, already mentioned, there is consideration of Carl Jung, Niccolo Machiavelli, Aristotle, Adam Smith, Charles Darwin, Claude Lvi-Strauss, Thorsten Veblen, and David Ricardo, all of them classical philosophical thinkers. Dorsey is to be commended for showing how the scholarly discipline of philosophy impacts the world &quot;out there,&quot; the one that everyone lives and works in. In the spirit of the late philosopher Mortimer Adler, who taught that &quot;philosophy is everybody's business,&quot; I recommend this book to all those who think the study of philosophy has nothing to do with real life. In fact, and Dorsey's book is an excellent illustration, philosophical concepts and principles are at the root of all human thought, emotions, and actions.	2004-06-01
US	52858812	R1AW5HONVK2B9I	0805074422	871647100	Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism	Books	5	383	402	N	N	A great contribution to the study of American history	It could be that Susan Jacoby's latest book may finally put an end to the ignorance that most Americans exhibit about the role that secularism has played in the social, cultural, and political development of the United States. It is a fact that Americans are woefully deficient when it comes to knowledge about American history, a lack which permits those with specific socio-political agendas to perpetuate distortions about the part that secularism and religion played in the founding of this nation and continue to play in its evolution. This matter is especially crucial now because of the current issues surrounding church-state separation, including an important case soon to be heard before the U.S. Supreme Court.<br />The importance of Jacoby's book is that it fills a gap which for too long has existed in the study and presentation of American history. It is often forgotten (or ignored?) that America's evolution was influenced by two great traditions, not just one as so many cultural commentators have insisted. The Judaic-Christian religious tradition certainly had a major impact on the development of American moral thinking and practice. But, equally important if not more so, the pagan or secular Greco-Roman tradition had its impact on the formation of American political institutions and the development of American jurisprudence. Many books have been written about the Judaic-Christian contributions (regrettably, some historically inaccurate), but the pagan-secular contributions have tended to be either forgotten or ignored and this problem has now been corrected by Jacoby's treatise.<br />Generally speaking, &quot;Freethinkers&quot; is an historical survey of secularist thought and influence in American history with a special emphasis on the most important actors in this unfolding drama. Included are such luminaries as Thomas Paine, who is just now making a comeback into the American consciousness, Thomas Jefferson, a president who by all accounts seems to be more secular than religious and appears to be a true theological Deist contrary to the declarations of many fundamentalist Christians, Abraham Lincoln, a president who was skeptical of Christianity and denied its divine origins, and Robert Ingersoll, an American philosopher whose absence from virtually all textbooks of American history is a national disgrace.<br />I must commend Jacoby for bringing Robert Green Ingersoll back into the limelight. Known in the latter half of the 19th century as that &quot;Great Agnostic,&quot; Ingersoll was truly one of the philosophical giants of that period. He has been largely ignored throughout the 20th century. During my entire academic studies in philosophy, no mention was ever made of him. I took a graduate course in American philosophy without hearing his name. I took undergraduate courses in various periods of American history and never heard a reference to him. I discovered this once-influential philosopher later when I was doing some independent work in American social thought. My reaction, after studying and reading him, was how shameful it is that this man was not better known to students today. Thanks to Jacoby for bringing him back into his rightful place in the American story. This is just one of the many highlights of her book.<br />One of the basic questions which is continually debated asks &quot;Is America a Christian nation.&quot; The secularists say &quot;No.&quot; What has come to be called the &quot;Christian Right&quot; says &quot;Yes.&quot; Now, both can't be correct within the same context. Jacoby argues that America was founded as a secular government. I suggest she is correct regarding this point. The Christian Right argues that America is a Christian nation. I suggest they are correct regarding this point. What appears at first glance to be a contradiction is not once we become aware of the context. Statistically, most Americans consider themselves to be Christians and, in this sense, America is a Christian nation. However, our government was never set up as a &quot;Christian government,&quot; a theocracy where the church, of whatever denomination, would dominate socio-political policy. As Jacoby rightly points out, the Constitution never mentions God and, furthermore, the Declaration of Independence mentions only &quot;nature's God,&quot; a reference that can be reasonably interpreted as Deistic.<br />Jacoby covers much territory in her book beginning with the intense debate over the omission of God from the Constitution and moving from 19th century abolitionism and suffragism through the 20th century's civil liberties, civil rights, and feminist movements. She includes the major characters involved in secular activism, like those already mentioned above, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Clarence Darrow and others whose importance to secularist philosophy are finally acknowledged. She offers a powerful defense of the secularist heritage that gave Americans a government founded not on religious authority but on human reason.<br />If I have a negative criticism, it is this: I don't think Jacoby presents a clear characterization of moral relativism; I suspect she has not really thought out all the implications of that concept. The secularists are wrong because they deny any objective moral criteria and promote moral judgments within a political context, while the religionists are wrong because they promote a revelation-based moral absolutism applied to all human acts. The concept of moral relativism is generally misunderstood, even among intellectuals, and objective criteria for determining ethical principles is usually confused with some sort of moral absolutism. The beauty and truth of Aristotle's &quot;Ethics,&quot; for instance, lies precisely in the fact that it is neither absolutist nor relativist, but provides an objective foundation for evaluating human acts.<br />I do hope that this book is widely read by a public whose knowledge of American history is, unfortunately, dismal. This is a great introduction to a cultural influence which has been largely forgotten or ignored. It is a great addition to any course or study in American history which wants to present itself as truly comprehensive. I also recommend this book because it provides a counterbalance to a traditionally one-sided picture of how this great nation of ours came into being and evolved to bring more freedom and opportunity to more people than any other nation that has ever existed.	2004-05-13
US	52858812	R32YD0BY1P56LR	0805076336	15072522	Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America	Books	5	82	90	N	N	Best argument I've seen thus far...	Suddenly, there seems to be an avalanche of books about the gay-marriage issue appearing in America's bookstores. There is little doubt now that the controversy over granting legal marriages to gay persons is snowballing and has become the hot topic of the times. Jonathan Rauch's book is another contribution to the debate and, to his credit, he does provide a slightly different slant on the issue from what I've read in other books.<BR> <BR>Rauch, a correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly, columnist for National Journal, and a writer-in-residence at the Brookings Institution, tends to de-emphasize the all-too-common \\"equal rights\\" argument and suggests, instead, that gay marriage would be good for American society because it would increase respect for the institution of marriage itself. To be clear about this, he doesn't dismiss the matter of equal rights but says \\"I wouldn't support same-sex marriage as a matter of equal rights if I thought it would wreck opposite-sex marriage.\\"<BR> <BR>One of the very basic questions regarding the question of marriage is, What is marriage for? He spends an entire chapter discussing this question, which sets the stage for his argument that gay marriage would be good, not only for gays, but for straights and for marriage in general. So, what is marriage for? Well, whatever else it is, he says, \\"it is a commitment to be there.\\" I interpret him to mean that in this special relationship called \\"marriage,\\" both parties to the compact promise to help and comfort one another when times are tough, in sickness and in health, etc., etc., which is, of course, a common understanding of what is, in fact, involved in a marriage -- at least ideally. He uses the term \\"prime-caregiver\\" and maintains that this is an essential condition of the marriage relationship. I don't think anyone would disagree.<BR> <BR>But then Rauch goes on to use this condition and some other benefits of the marital relationship to argue for gay-marriage as opposed to \\"same-sex unions\\" or \\"domestic partnerships,\\" situations which he refers to as \\"marriage-lite.\\" I'm not sure I buy his argument at this point. I don't think many would disagree that gay couples have a legitimate concern regarding caregiver status, legal and financial benefits, hospital visitation rights, and all the other rights and privileges that opposite-sex couples currently enjoy under the marriage umbrella. I don't see why these conditions cannot be realized within the \\"same-sex union\\" designation, without applying the term \\"marriage\\" to the relationship. In Chapter Two of his book, Rauch presents his case against my reservation. And, frankly, he presents a good case. It isn't compelling, in my opinion, but it comes close to persuasive. And I am sympathetic with most of the points he makes.<BR> <BR>Now we come to a section of the book that one might consider the \\"trilogy of benefits.\\" In Chapter Three, Rauch discusses the specific benefits that gays will enjoy if given the right to marry and they are fairly obvious, of course. In Chapter Four, on how the straights will benefit, he includes some very interesting material and states some points that I suspect most of us haven't done much thinking about. In Chapter Five, he discusses how marriage-in-general will benefit from gay marriage, and again he presents an interesting argument, one which should not be taken lightly by the opponents of gay marriage. I think I won't disclose any details about the latter two chapters, hopefully providing a teaser for the potential reader.<BR> <BR>One of the major concerns that social conservatives seem to have with the gay-marriage issue surrounds the idea that gays, particularly of the male persuasion, are unduly promiscuous and that granting gays the right to marry would fail to change that behavior. Furthermore, bringing this alleged promiscuousness into marriage would harm the institution itself. Rauch addresses this concern and is upfront and honest about it and he should be commended for his forthrightness. He admits there are important problems here and offers some suggestions as to how they might be resolved.<BR> <BR>In my opinion, one of the best chapters in Rauch's book deals with \\"The Debt to Tradition.\\" Here he seems to be at his best. No where else, and I mean nowhere, have I read a discussion about the gay-marriage issue quite like he provides in this chapter. Suffice to say, he brings two of my favorite people into the debate, F.A. Hayek and Edmund Burke (excellent political theorists both), and then the topics of utopias, social engineering, church-state relations, secular culture, reactionary traditionalism, and so on are thrown into the mix, and finally some rational light is thrown on how to deal with, not only the legitimacy of gay marriage, but how to transition to it. (The reading of this short chapter is worth the price of the book.)<BR> <BR>And, if gay marriage is to become a reality, how the transition to it takes place is vital. The position that Rauch takes is basically the same as the one I would take. I am already on record as opposing any constitutional amendment regarding the definition of marriage. Messing with the Constitution seems to get us into trouble. Furthermore, I don't think that Congress should be involved in the situation. Rauch suggests, and I concur, that the best approach is to leave the matter to the individual states. Let us \\"try it out\\" here and there, see what happens, make adjustments where necessary, and so on. Actually, Rauch's position is very \\"conservative\\" and he comes off like a good proponent of \\"states rights.\\" His next-to-last chapter on \\"Getting It Right\\" outlines his proposals and I think one will find it difficult to argue against them.<BR> <BR>This is a very readable book by someone who has a deep interest in his subject and has done his homework, that is, the thinking necessary to present a complex argument regarding a controversial change in our nation's social fabric. I recommend it to all those interested in the gay-marriage issue.	2004-03-19
US	52858812	R2EUOG9B6RTP05	1579548679	324152627	Midlife Crisis at 30: How the Stakes Have Changed for a New Generation--And What to Do about It	Books	5	55	70	N	N	Good topic, good analysis, well written	It might strike one as rather odd that I, a committed member of the male gender with his feet firmly planted in the category of senior citizen, should be reviewing a book that is more or less intended for the young female member of the present generation whose feet are barely planted on the ground. But sometimes one is asked to do what appears at first to be somewhat strange, which later turns out to be both an interesting and insightful encounter.<BR> <BR>Such is the case with this book by two successful and experienced journalists, Lia Macko and Kerry Rubin, about the midlife-crisis problem which seems to affect many professional women at around the age of thirty or so in American society today. I won't pretend for a moment that I can directly and intimately relate to the specific situations they describe, but I can at least glimpse some of its enigmas, frustrations, and ramifications since many of us men go through a similar, albeit not exact, form of personal crisis usually around the age of forty or so. Alas, as with puberty, the females reach this life-challenging singularity before we males do.<BR> <BR>The midlife crisis discussed in this book is grounded on the fact that a significant number of the fifty-eight million young women of what is now called Generation X/Y seem to undergo powerful conflicts in their work/life circumstances and at a very early age in their careers. This is occurring even before marriage and children are part of the situation. So, considering this problem as worthy of an investigation, Macko and Rubin set about to use the latest research and census data and, I think more importantly, interviews with more than one hundred college-educated career women between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-seven in an attempt to come up with some critical analyses and some plausible resolutions. I think in general that they were successful in accomplishing both tasks.<BR> <BR>One of the things that made the reading of this book enjoyable for me was that I was familiar with many of the women whom the authors interviewed and whose contributions ended up being presented in the book, such as former vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, whom I didn't vote for but have admired for many years for her astute political analysis, and Rikki Klieman, a brilliant trial attorney whom I've watched many times hosting a program on Court-TV. There are others whose personal stories are interesting and enlightening, and with whom I'm acquainted, including the prominent Republican strategist Mary Matalin, CNN host Paula Zahn, and novelist Judy Blume, one of whose books (dare I admit it?) I read some years ago to uncover what all the fuss was about regarding some books she wrote for young girls.<BR> <BR>There is one conclusion I have come to after reading this book. While contemporary women may be having their midlife crisis earlier than men do, and there are some significant differences in the way they experience it from the way men do, it is surprising that many of the questions they are asking themselves are similar to the questions men ask themselves when they experience their own midlife crisis. Unfortunately, men going through their crisis tend to do so silently and in secret, while the women are intelligent and clever enough to be more open and conversant. Men should take a cue from this. They might suffer less.<BR> <BR>Of course, there is one really big consideration in the female's midlife crisis that men do not have to directly deal with and that is motherhood and children and how to integrate that into one's career as a professional woman. Macko and Rubin include some interesting insights into that situation. Men, after all, don't get pregnant and have to figure out how to wrestle with that situation in the workplace (I suspect that if men did have to go through a pregnancy, whether in the workplace or not, the human race would shortly cease to exist!).<BR> <BR>There are many questions raised in this book which are familiar to those of us who have a philosophical bent and they are not really new questions, just old questions asked within a contemporary context. For instance, questions about happiness, and fulfillment, and perfection. Can I have it all -- career and family and a rewarding personal relationship? Or, if not, why not? If I can't have it all, what can I settle for and be happy with? What really is the good life, especially for me? What are my priorities and, in light of my desires, what am I willing to compromise or ask someone else to compromise? Heady stuff, that, with roots that go back into antiquity.<BR> <BR>All right, one can get carried away here, so I'll cease and desist. I'll just simply say that this book is very well written and deserves a wide audience especially among those young women coming of age who are thinking about both career and family and how to integrate their roles within both enterprises. I think this book will provide some insight and much food for thought and self-reflection. I won't hesitate to recommend this book to the male reader either, since, being the progressive-minded senior citizen that I am, and having come of age in a far more restrictive generation when it comes to career women, I think it's high-time for us members of the opposite gender to try to understand just what it is that our partners-in-living are going through when they experience their midlife crisis. &quot;Audiatur et altera pars.&quot;	2004-03-15
US	52858812	R2HBEXJDUSFEH5	0399529519	215838741	How Do You Compare?	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Interesting and challenging	Ordinarily, I don't read and review self-improvement books. I've read quite a few them in the past and found most of them wanting. Sure, now and then a decent self-help book will come off the press and even I have found it helpful. Most of them, however, are too much the same and intended to either make the author a lot of money or create a new fad, with some self-promoting guru raking in the fame and fortune.<BR> <BR>So, when I was offered the opportunity to review \\"How Do You Compare?\\", I was hesitant. I wasn't sure I'd be interested in what still another author had to say about improving oneself. But my curiosity was peaked when I learned that the book included twelve simple tests which were based on more complicated tests which had actually been developed and tested themselves by experts in the field of experimental psychology. Since I have a background in testing, evaluation, and quantitative analysis, plus have taken a number of courses in psychology at both the undergraduate and graduate level, I decided, what the heck, I'd read the book and maybe even write a review about it.<BR> <BR>\\"How Do You Compare?\\" is a very readable book and, in addition to the twelve tests provided, contains a lot of interesting information about the nature, history, and development of various types of evaluation, including intelligent tests, creativity tests, social skills tests, and personality tests in general. Spaced throughout the book, and making the adventure more enjoyable than usual for books in this genre, are cartoons related to the discussion at hand and textual tidbits providing the reader with little-known facts such as the relationship between Graham crackers and sexual behavior. I knew about that one, having heard about Dr. Graham many years ago, but I'd bet most people aren't aware of that peculiar, practically useless, yet very interesting, factoid.<BR> <BR>The structure of the book is very simple: get some background information about a part of your mind, take a little test to learn something about yourself, and then compare yourself to thousands of others who have taken the test. The tests are divided into three main sections and a final \\"big picture\\" questionnaire with the title, \\"How satisfied are you with your personality?\\" The first section includes a brief intelligence test and a test for creativity. The second section includes four tests or sets of questions to check up on your social skills. The third section, which deals with the subject of motivation, includes tests about happiness, cheerfulness, peak experiences, locus of control, and even, -- wouldn't you know it? -- a cheerfulness test for a friend to complete about you.<BR> <BR>Most people who take tests such as these are interested in three primary points: How did I score on the test?; What do my answers mean?; How did others score on the test? The author goes into some detail to help the reader, or in this case, the test-taker, deal with these questions. He raises a number of issues related to one's personality profile and suggests possibilities for self-improvement under headings like: Do you have a messy desk?; Can you buy creativity?; Do you drink for inspiration?; Is your date attractive at the end of the night?; and What is your happy life expectancy? -- intriguing questions, these, and the results of the research into them by behavioral scientists may surprise you.<BR> <BR>Of course, since the book is within the self-improvement genre, it must also provide some practical advice to help those who want indeed to improve themselves. This it does. At various places throughout the text, the author gives suggestions, both positive and negative, as to how to improve one's performance in life, including the eight ingredients for a successful relationship and, something even I was unaware of, the health benefits of kissing. All my life I thought it was just for fun! Now I know it's healthy, too!<BR> <BR>There is one brief discussion the author has in the book that I think especially stands out and I would hope that most of us would pay close attention to it. In the section dealing with intelligence and creativity, he lists what he calls the \\"creativity killers,\\" those things we say to children, or fail to say, which can impact negatively on a child's ability to become a truly creative individual. As a former educator of young children, I can relate to the importance of this warning.<BR> <BR>As self-improvement books go, this one far outdistances most of them I've read. To the credit of the author, and to the advantage of the really serious reader, Williams includes citations for every research paper he mentions so they can be consulted and studied. He also provides an index to the major topics discussed, something not common to books of this type.<BR> <BR>Finally, I gladly recommend this book to all who want to learn more about themselves, about how they compare with others, and, above all, how they might go about improving their lives. If you're looking for a self-help book that is based on real scientific research, yet is interesting and fun to read, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything better right now.	2004-03-07
US	52858812	R3MZHLRLDIGTPU	0805075615	641939565	In the Company of Soldiers: A Chronicle of Combat	Books	5	93	112	N	N	An extraordinary account of the Iraqi war	If you are a military history buff, you will love this book. If not, it might be the right time to take a plunge into the subject. This account of military history is about Operation Iraqi Freedom. While justifications for the recent war between the American-British coalition forces and Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime are still being debated among politicos and the general public, the facts are that it did occur, American and British soldiers died and were wounded, a brutal dictator was toppled, and we watched the whole event play itself out on live television. Now the Iraqi people have been given the opportunity to rebuild a country in their own image and likeness.<br />Rick Atkinson, a former staff writer and senior editor at The Washington Post and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author, has written a journal of his experiences in the Iraqi conflict, beginning on the morning of February 26, 2003 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, home of the famous &quot;Screaming Eagles,&quot; the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army. After a couple of days of orientation, Atkinson and dozens of other journalists were flown to the Middle East. Thereafter, he lived with the 101st Airborne Division from their preparations in Kuwait to the occupation of Baghdad -- a period of almost two months -- and was granted complete access to the commanders and troops.<br />&quot;In the Company of Soldiers&quot; is Atkinson's very up-close and personal story of the war, in which he details every aspect of the conflict from planning and debriefings with the commanders, to his accounts of the battles the soldiers fought, to his sometimes intimate stories about the soldiers involved. It is an eyewitness account, occasionally laced with sadness and disappointment, occasionally with joy and pride. But more than that, it is also the story of one man, Major General David H. Petraeus, commander of the 101st Airborne Division, a modern warrior who was described once by a colleague as &quot;the most competitive man on the planet.&quot;<br />The author spent much of his time in Iraq alongside Petraeus, who finished near the top of his 1974 class at West Point, and was known then as a &quot;striver to the max.&quot; No ordinary soldier by any means, Petraeus had received a doctorate in international relations from Princeton University and for twenty-five years had been through various command and staff assignments, including tours in Haiti and Bosnia. Now he was commanding the &quot;Screaming Eagles,&quot; a force of 17,000 troops, in a war in a forlorn and desolate desert environment, testing both his physical and mental skills. Atkinson, sitting in on the daily briefings as the division's attacks were planned, watches as Petraeus wrestles with numerous tactical enigmas and observes as the general instructs, motivates, and leads his soldiers and subordinate commanders in several intense engagements.<br />While describing this stressful and anxious journey into and during war, Atkinson introduces the reader to many other heroes of the combat, from Lt. General William Wallace, commander of V Corps, to Brig. Generals Ben Freakley and Edward Sinclair, assistant division commanders respectively for operations and support, Col. Mike Linnington of the 3rd Brigade, a number of CWOs who pilot the helicopters used in the battles, and, of course, that ordinary brave soldier on the ground whose job it is to do the job and often be irreverent when speaking about it. Our nation should be proud of them.<br />Even though I was on a deadline to complete another project, I read the entire book in two days because I had difficulty putting it aside. This is a firsthand account of war. It is a vivid picture of a remarkable group of soldiers and commanders. It reads more like a suspense novel than a nonfiction work narrating actual events. Atkinson's writing-style is what I call &quot;facile and friendly,&quot; that is, easy on the eye and the mind, so much so that the storystays in the forefront rather than the sentence structure. And yet the details he provides are worthy of a scholarly work. In fact, the writing is so well done it's like a &quot;motion picture in the mind,&quot; something I don't say about many books.<br />There are other things I really like about the book besides the writing style. One is the presentation of two maps at the front of the book (The Iraqi Battleground and Route of the 101st Airborne Division) which allows the reader to follow the movements of the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq; the maps are particularly helpful for those of us unfamiliar with the geography of that part of the world. I found myself constantly referring to them as the story unfolded, in fact so much so that I finally put a paper clip on the page so I could access them faster. Also valuable are the schematic which helps to identify the command structure of V Corps and the glossary of military jargon. Without the latter, I wouldn't have known an OGA from a DCU from an ASR. Still another plus is that the index of topics is very detailed.<br />I highly recommend this book to you whether you are interested in military history or not. You will not be disappointed. This is still ongoing history and a knowledge of how we got to this point in the situation seems to me to be important. Many of us watched this story unfold on television. Now we have the chance to read the book. True, this is the reverse of the usual situation -- read the book, then see the movie -- but television coverage, in retrospect, did not really provide us with the up-close and personal experience that Rick Atkinson provides us in this superbly written account of a most significant contemporary military conflict.	2004-02-28
US	52858812	R30Q31YC62NNRU	097257770X	363480021	Whats It All About? A Guide to Lifes Basic Questions and Answers	Books	5	25	25	N	N	Highly recommended!	There are certain basic questions which thinking human beings have asked for thousands of years. The questions remain the same today as they were eons ago. On the other hand, the answers to those questions have varied with the ages and the characters wrestling with them. It is easy in today's world to ignore these fundamental questions, surrounded as we are with a pop-culture mentality and the loud and distracting media which generally offer little more than mindless entertainment for the masses. It is also easy in today's world, if one wants to confront these basic questions either out of desire or necessity, to find any number of quick and instant solutions from simplistic self-help manuals, to media talking-heads offering up the latest fads in philosophy and religion, to the pseudo-intellectual gurus who will gladly take your money in return for their latest &quot;fix&quot; which promises you the &quot;true&quot; and only true answer to those certain basic questions.<BR> <BR>Well, I'll tell you right now that this book by Dr. Richard de la Chaumire doesn't fall into any of the above categories. It is not a quick fix. It is not simplistic. It does not promise you the true and only true answer to the certain basic questions. It does, however, promise to help you make up your own mind about the answers. To do this, the author provides a sweeping interdisciplinary view of how others have wrestled with these questions, expanding your knowledge so you are better informed and competent to deal with these questions, in the hope that you can formulate your own philosophy of life for the simple reason that doing so will enable you to have a life that is truly worth living. This book is a guide to achieving practical wisdom, not the final pronouncement of practical wisdom itself. You will be provided with the recipe for thinking about the basic questions, but you'll have to mix the ingredients and do the baking yourself.<BR> <BR>You may be asking now: &quot;What are theseso-called basic questions?&quot; They should be familiar to you as we all ask them in one way or another at sometime in our lives, some of us openly and in lively discussion, others secretly within themselves, some in times of casual philosophical reflection, some in times of despair or crisis. Here is the first one that Dr. de la Chaumire puts forth for consideration: Is there a God? Certainly this is the most significant and probably most common of the basic questions. This is followed by some other basic questions such as: Why is there anything at all?; Who am I?; Why am I here?: Is there life after death?; Why so much suffering in the world?; How ought I to live?; Am I really free to choose?; and also that most contemporary and controversial of questions: How do we know when we know?<BR> <BR>After a brief introduction to these and other basic questions, the author raises another question about the basic questions: Why and why not ask these questions? This leads into an interesting discussion of human consciousness, the important role it plays in raising the basic questions in the first place, the religious factor and the decline of religion, and the impact of science, rationalism, and Biblical criticism on religion's attempt to answer the basic questions, along with the important role that such luminaries as Copernicus, Charles Darwin, and Sigmund Freud have played in the whole enterprise. Most readers will probably find the author's discussion of &quot;Why should truth be so important?&quot; to be enlightening.<BR> <BR>The third part of the book deals with that most important question: How do we know when we know? Here the reader is presented with an overview of our Greek heritage in philosophy and science, the scientific revolution that took place during the 16th and 17th centuries, the range and limits of empiricism and, finally, a discussion of some ways of knowing, including authority, revelation, introspection, intuition, and even altered states of consciousness. I must say that his presentations of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are among the best I've seen in a book written for general readers. And those unfamiliar with the philosophical problems raised by such thinkers as Descartes, Francis Bacon, Locke, Hume, and Kant will come away with a fair grasp of their essential ideas.<BR> <BR>The author continues, in the fourth part of his book, with a discussion of various types of &quot;truth seekers,&quot; dividing them into contrasting categories such as optimists and pessimists, visionaries and realists, and religious seekers and spiritual seekers. This sets the stage for a comprehensive presentation of various world views, including a scientific world view with recent developments in cosmology, physics, and biology, a naturalistic and evolutionary world view incorporating a type of spirituality, and five major religious world views: Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. All of this is offered in a very readable fashion so the general reader will not be overwhelmed.<BR> <BR>The author begins the Preface of his book with these words: &quot;If you would like to make up your own mind and heart about some of the basic questions of life, this book is intended for you.&quot; From that point on, the reader journeys through an intensive and comprehensive survey providing a background and framework for dealing with the basic questions of life. Dr. de la Chaumire has provided a valuable service to those who ask these basic questions and I recommend his book to everyone.<BR> <BR>The author is a licensed psychologist with a doctorate in psychology and a master's degree from the University of Notre Dame, where he pursued his interest in philosophy and religion. It is evident from his writing, however, that his knowledge ranges far beyond those interests and that he possesses a talent for communicating about otherwise difficult topics with anyone who takes the time to have a serious encounter with him.	2004-02-24

We had been brutally attacked. But by whom? Not by another country, as we soon discovered. Not by some vile dictator or head-of-state, as we later discovered. So who? Who was the enemy? Then, of course, came the question: Why were the World Trade Center and the Pentagon attacked in the first place? Why would someone deliberately, maliciously murder thousands of ordinary, innocent people?<BR> <br />&quot;Civilization and Its Enemies&quot; is an attempt by Lee Harris to answer these and other questions. The work is a brilliant analysis of the current geopolitical situation and how it came to be what it is. More significantly, it provides an insight into the historical precipitates and intellectual foundations and foibles which may account for the 9/11 tragedy.<BR> <BR>&quot;The subject of this book,&quot; says Harris on the opening page, &quot;is forgetfulness.&quot; Modern civilization has forgotten how it became civilized in the first place; it isn't knowledgeable of the long period of cultural evolution involved; and it doesn't remember the tremendous amount of labor, cultural and intellectual, that went into the development of civil society. Moreover, modern civilization has forgotten about a category called &quot;the enemy.&quot; This concept of the enemy -- someone who is willing to die to kill another -- had been discarded from our moral and political discourse. And that fact, according to Harris, has left modern civilization vulnerable to attack by those who are the enemy of civilized society.<BR> <BR>This is an interesting thesis and, at first glance, may appear to be an implausible explanation for the 9/11 tragedy which was, according to the author, an end in itself and not a means to some other political or social end. Many contemporary observers may find this latter statement problematic since we are so accustomed to thinking in terms of warfare as a means to anend. Harris suggests that our ordinary understanding about what wars are and why they are fought is not applicable to the current conflict with terrorism. The nature of the game, so to speak, has changed and so has the enemy, and 9/11 was a manifestation of that change.<BR> <BR>So, who is this enemy and what is his intent? How did civilization get itself into this situation where it became so vulnerable to this enemy? What is the historical backdrop? What were the social and cultural influences? Who or what is really responsible? What can modern civilization do, if anything, to protect itself? Harris's discussion of these questions takes the reader on a tour through the development of civilization from antiquity to the present day, forming the framework with which he analyzes our current dilemma and providing a rationale for his conclusions.<BR> <BR>One of the most interesting of his discussions has to do with what Harris calls &quot;fantasy ideology&quot; and the related &quot;transformative belief.&quot; He also points out the difference between abstract reasoning and concrete reasoning and discusses the &quot;fanaticism&quot; of abstract thought, important elements in the presentation of his argument. His concept of fantasy ideology is familiar to me because, while I use a different term to describe the phenomenon, it appears to be a subcategory of what I have called &quot;intellectual insanity&quot; in my own writings. Modern intellectuals are particularly susceptible to this type of thinking, which eventually leads them into the irrational abyss of moral and cultural relativism, epistemological subjectivism, metaphysical idealism, politicism, and scientism.<BR> <BR>Harris does more, of course, than just provide us with the historical background and intellectual underpinnings which have led to our present situation. He deals with the practical matter of our current conflict with &quot;the enemy,&quot; giving us his prescriptions about how we should meet and confront the problem in the very real context within which we have to deal with it. Many intellectuals, especially those in the academic enterprise, will recoil at some of his suggestions.<BR> <BR>But the problem we face today, the author says, is this: &quot;The ideals that our intellectuals have been instilling in us are utopian ideals, designed for men and women who know no enemy and who do not need to take precautions against him.&quot; These utopian ideals are dangerous because they are out of touch with the situation as it really is. The new enemy of civilization does not play his &quot;war&quot; game according to the rules we are used to; indeed, as far as he is concerned there are no rules at all. Our intellectuals and those who influence our social and political policies must come to realize this. Our old categories of thought and analysis will no longer suffice. And this brings Harris to what may be his most controversial conclusion as far as the academic intellectuals are concerned.<BR> <BR>Only the United States can play the sovereign in today's world. And if the use of force is necessary to defend civilization, then America will have to use it. At the same time Harris realizes the responsibilities involved in this type of action and points out the necessity, and dilemma, of being ruthless in the defense of civilization while not succumbing to ruthlessness itself. However, because it has produced, over a long period of time and through many sociopolitical conflicts, a practical design for solving and settling problems without resorting to massive ruthlessness, the United States is the only nation which can do the job required if civilization is to be defended and the enemy defeated.<BR> <BR>This is an important book that every American citizen should read. It should be required reading for our college and university students who are so desperately in need of intellectual guidance through the realities of the current geopolitical conflict which puts civilization itself in jeopardy. My only criticism of the book is that Harris needs to recognize there are some intellectuals around who don't subscribe to utopian fantasies and the fanaticism of abstract thought. I like to think I'm one of them.	2004-01-31

David Moats is the editorial page editor of the \\"Rutland Herald\\" who won a Pulitzer Prize for his editorials in support of gay marriage. \\"Civil Wars,\\" his book on the subject, reads more like a novel in the thriller genre than a nonfictional account of the judicial and legislative battle over same-sex unions which occurred in the state of Vermont in 2000. In that year the \\"Green Mountain State\\" became the first state to grant gay and lesbian couples the right to join in civil unions. In the Prologue to his book, Moats asks the question: \\"How did such a thing happen in Vermont?\\" The rest of the book is devoted to providing an answer.<BR> <BR>On Monday, December 20, 1999, the Vermont Supreme Court rendered its decision in a case brought before it over a year previously. It was a controversial case where the Court was being urged to establish that gay and lesbian couples had the right to marry. The opinion issued by the Court, however, was both a win and a loss for the proponents of gay marriage. While recognizing that the issue was secular rather than religious and that denying marriage to gays violated the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution, the Court ruled that the final disposition of the matter should rest with the state legislature. In a surprising move, the Court had moved the controversy from the judicial realm to the political arena. As a result a new and even more vigorous conflict would ensue.<BR> <BR>The narrative that unfolds has all the elements of a good drama: there is joy and sadness, there are high points and lowpoints, there are wins and losses, there are heroes, victims, and the occasional cad, whose behavior at times borders on the incomprehensible. The reader will first meet Beth Robinson, the determined attorney who argued the case before the Supreme Court, and then hear the personal stories of the plaintiffs who were courageous enough to come forward and attach their names to the legal action. The reader will also meet many members of the Vermont legislature, those that supported the move toward recognition of same-sex unions and those that opposed it. Their individual stories add a special and telling ingredient to the narrative as a whole. And, in what must be one of the most stirring parts of the book, the author lets the citizens of Vermont speak for themselves, those in favor of the change and those against it.<BR> <BR>In my personal opinion, one of the highlights of the book occurs in Chapter Nine. It is really unrelated to the historical events which unfolded during the time the Vermont legislature was dealing with the gay marriage issue, but I think it is an enlightening sidebar to this controversial matter. Sharon Underwood, mother of a gay son, wrote an impassioned opinion piece which appeared in a local newspaper and expressed her anger, as Moats says, \\"about the hypocrisy and self-righteousness of those who had adopted a moral tone to condemn and attack their neighbors.\\" In her op-ed, Ms. Underwood briefly relates some of the horrific things which happened to her son beginning at the age of six, simply because he was perceived to be \\"different.\\" Her two-page story alone is worth the price of the book.<BR> <BR>Moats is clearly aware of one of the most problematic aspects of the gay marriage issue. He points out early on that \\"In confronting the issue of gay marriage, the nation confronts a paradox of liberal democracy. The dignity of the individual was a moral value that rested on religious and philosophical traditions prevailing in eighteenth-century Britain and its colonies. Yet liberal democracy lifts that value into the secular realm, where it serves as the premise for equality and justice before the law.\\"<BR> <BR>This is an important point. Those who oppose any change in the marriage laws because of the Judeo-Christian tradition which they claim forms the foundation of our society fail to see that, while it is true that many of our moral beliefs are founded on Christian principles, our political framework and the theories underlying it are not. The political foundation of our society is firmly set on ideas derived from the secular, \\"pagan\\" cultures of ancient Greece and Rome. Our Republic must in the end be secular and inclusive, and our representative democracy must be fair and just to all citizens. And this may mean a recognition of the fundamental right to choose a marriage partner without interference from the state.<BR> <BR>Is there anything missing in Moats' telling of the events he relates? I can think of at least two things I wished he would have explained more in detail but, in fairness to him, he may have considered them irrelevant to the issue at hand or he may have been unable to pursue them. One, I would have liked more information about the rationale of the Catholic legislators who, in apparent defiance of their bishop's directive, supported legalization of gay marriage. Secondly, I would have liked to know why Neil Randall, a Libertarian legislator, would join with Nancy Sheltra, leader of the House conservatives, to derail a domestic partnership bill and push for a constitutional amendment forbidding both gay marriage and domestic partnership. Libertarians are well-known for generally opposing state intervention in strictly personal matters. But, as any student of politics knows, politics makes for strange bedfellows.<BR> <BR>In conclusion, this book is definitely not a one-sided partisan report on gay marriage. Although the author is clearly sympathetic to the legalization of gay marriage, he is eminently fair in describing both sides of the issue and in his evaluation of the characters on both sides of the matter. I would recommend his book to all those interested in a fair and balanced discussion of same-sex unions, regardless of the side one currently takes on this very divisive issue, which is sure to claim the attention of the public for some time to come.	2003-12-16
US	52858812	R3CSAD62Q58VN1	0805074007	932608591	Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance (The American Empire Project)	Books	1	62	194	N	N	Same Old Stuff, Packaged A Litle Differently	Noam Chomsky, long-standing activist intellectual and spokesman for the so-called New Left, now graces us with his latest effort in anti-American rhetoric. While many of the issues raised in this book are worthy of an objective investigation and evaluation, the work is hardly objective and, while it may present itself as a scholarly treatise, it rapidly deteriorates into nothing more than a propaganda screed for a narrow, one-sided, and simplistic point of view. Furthermore, Chomsky seems to lack any sense of historical perspective, fails to articulate any coherent political framework, and does not seem to understand the nuances of modern geopolitics.<BR> <BR>What seems to be the main idea of the book? In brief, Chomsky apparently thinks that the United States is the most reprehensible of all the major powers in the world and its foreign policy is absolutely pernicious. It has become the most belligerent power in the world. It is the greatest menace to the national self-determination of other countries. It is the greatest threat to world peace and international cooperation. And, finally, the United States is a supporter of and a perpetrator of terrorism on a grand scale against those it perceives as its enemies.<BR> <BR>Chomsky claims to base these assertions on \\"facts.\\" But facts, as any historian or social scientist knows, must be interpreted and placed in a context. It is easy to twist facts, ignore incongruous facts, distort a context, or disregard a context. In the case that Chomsky is trying to make here, it appears that his choices regarding evidence and his analysis of that evidence is dominated by his overwhelming desire to put the worst possible interpretation on the \\"motives\\" of America in regard to its participation in world affairs. Political philosopher Hannah Arendt suggested that the great achievement of the 20th-century totalitarians was to turn questions of fact into questions of motive. Then you don't have to answer facts with facts; all you needto do is impugn the motives of the target you have selected for castigation and hurl the most damaging epithets at it. In short, the old pastime of name-calling or, for the more philosophically inclined, the ad hominem argument. One might suggest that it is precisely what the author of this book is doing.<BR> <BR>Chomsky's response to the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center is illustrative. He claims that no matter how appalling the terrorists' actions were, the United States had done worse and he attempts to support this judgment with arguments and evidence. But his evidence is highly selective and his arguments suspect. In attempting to justify the attack, he refers, for instance, to the incident in Sudan where a pharmaceutical factory was assaulted by an American missile because the CIA suspected that Iraqi scientists were involved in making chemical or biological weapons. Chomsky fails, however, to note that the missile was fired at night so no workers would be present and that the factory was not located in or near a residential area; innocent lives would not be directly threatened. Whether one agrees or not with then-President Clinton's decision to order the assault, it hardly rises to the level, either in intent or actuality, to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.<BR> <BR>Moreover, Chomsky apparently judges the morality of actions executed by the United States using a rather direct and simple formula: If an action is right for us, it is right for others; and if it is wrong for others, it is wrong for us. This might be a nice moral principle in the abstract, but it can be dreadfully deceiving when attempting to apply it to the complex world of international politics. Furthermore, Chomsky gives the impression that he wants to apply this moral principle primarily to the actions of the Western liberal democracies, not to others, including the acts committed by the terrorists in September 2001.<BR> <BR>Is America really anevil empire, as Chomsky apparently thinks? I think an objective look at the historical record will provide the evidence that America has done more good for more people than any country in the history of the world. The United States rebuilt Europe twice in the 20th century after two world wars. Europe was liberated from the Nazi menace primarily through the intervention of the United States. Eastern Europe was liberated from the tyranny of communism primarily because the United States was willing to take the leadership role in destroying it.<BR> <BR>Now, if the United States is and has been such a terrible nation, responsible for the horrible repression that Chomsky alleges, then why, one must ask, is this country the first choice of refugees looking for a new home? Why do most people choose to flee to the United States, rather than from it? Why have so many other nations, many of them apparently admired by Chomsky, been forced to build walls and fences to keep their population captive? Why is Cuba under the Castro government a better place to live or, for that matter, Cambodia under Pol Pot or Vietnam under the current totalitarian regime? And lastly, why do so many other nations look to the United States for help when they need it? This is not to say that the United States is perfect. It is not. But it is definitely not the evil empire that Chomsky asserts.<BR> <BR>In summary, I suspect that Chomsky's latest diatribe will have great appeal to his devoted followers. Those who dismiss his interpretations and analyses will simply say it is a repeat of his usual rantings against the United States. Nevertheless, I recommend this book to all readers; it is a good exemplar of pure political propaganda disguised as a serious work. In a different time and place, it would have made Dr. Joseph Goebbels proud. The \\"New York Times\\" apparently thinks, in its words, that \\"Noam Chomsky is arguably the most important intellectual alive.\\" If this is really true, God help us all.	2003-11-08

According to the author, many of these &quot;yet to be married&quot; have formed cohesive social groups which he calls &quot;urban tribes.&quot; These tribes, formed on the basis of friendship and sometimes intimate relationships, seem to have taken the place of the traditional family.<br />The first part of this book is generally introspective and autobiographical with Watters drawing on his own experiences in attempting to understand his own status as a &quot;yet to be married&quot; member of an urban tribe. The latter part of the book is more outer-directed and analytical, and Watters discusses some social theories and sociological data which may help to shed light on the development of this new type of community.<br />There are a few initial problems with which the author wrestles early in the book. One is the difficulty with defining exactly what an urban tribe is and what differences and similarities may exist that characterize various tribes in varying settings. A second is the question of why so little attention has been paid to this phenomenon and why it has had so little public recognition. Finally, a question that I think is at the core of the book: Why have so many of these &quot;yet to be married&quot; opted to settle into urban tribes instead of forming a conventional family as previous generations have done?<br />These are interesting questions and Watters approaches them in a number of ways at various stages of his very personal quest. Along the way the reader will be introduced to the Burning Man festival in the Black Rock Desert, the American Association of Single People, the activity of &quot;social networking,&quot; the problem of defining the word &quot;single,&quot; an academic discipline called evolutionary psychology, information about mating behavior, and the concept of &quot;social capital.&quot; The reader will also hear about the author's attempt to glean some insight from experts at a national convention of the American Psychological Association and the author's participation in a Cinco de Mayo celebration in Philadelphia to which, Watters pointedly notes, no Hispanics had been invited.<br />One of my favorite segments, however, was the author's discussion of &quot;gossip and grooming,&quot; a notion based on the work of biological anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who suggests an intriguing association between the use of language and the size of groups we humans choose to socialize in. Monkeys and other nonhuman primates spend a great deal of time in the practice of grooming one another. The time and effort involved in this grooming seems to have some effect on the size of the social group with which the individual animal associates. After all, there is only so much time a monkey has for this type of activity. Dunbar theorized that human beings had replaced grooming with talking, specifically gossiping, and that the size of a human social group might be limited by the number of people one could effectively gossip with. There's more to this matter, of course, and I have oversimplified my description of it, but the entire discussion of gossip and grooming is rather fascinating, as are the conclusions that Watters draws at the end regarding its usefulness in understanding the size of human groups.<br />I suspect that this work will appeal more to those in their twenties and thirties than it will to people of my generation, the one which came of age in the 1950s and 60s. My peers and I were still attached to the notion of the traditional marriage and family fast-track which had been the heritage passed down to us by a previous period. Things have apparently changed since then and Watters, who is in his late thirties, sets out on a personal investigation to find out why his generation has deviated from what once was considered the &quot;norm&quot; -- finish your education, find a job, get married, and start your family, without much lag-time in between these stages.<br />This is not to say that those of the generation prior to the one described by Watters have nothing to learn here. Undoubtedly they do. The fact that many of the senior members of contemporary society are critical of the current trend of young men and women waiting until much later to get married and have children shows, at least, that they are becoming cognizant of the phenomenon. To his credit, Watters does confront this criticism head on and he attempts to deflate it, explaining that things may not be as bad as some critics have suggested.<br />This is not a book written from a sociologist's perspective. Watters is a journalist by profession and his writing is very personal throughout the book; he is actually involved much of the time in investigating his own life and the choices he's made. While clearly understanding the serious social impact of the topic he discusses, Watters still manages to write with a bit of wit and humor and a flair for mixing objective analysis with subjective synthesis, not an easy thing to do when dealing with any subject, especially with one as complex and illusive as social interactions. &quot;Urban Tribes&quot; is a good first-attempt at analyzing and understanding an interesting contemporary issue.	2003-10-22
US	52858812	R2ANQIXXT4439R	0195141830	600036030	The Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew	Books	5	57	63	N	N	An excellent contribution to Christian history	If you like mysteries, true detective stories, and historical controversies, Professor Ehrman's newest book is just right for you. It is about early Christianity, or more accurately, early &quot;Christianities.&quot; Why the plural? Simply because in the first centuries after Christ, there was no one single group which could be called the authentic &quot;Christian&quot; religion. There was, instead, a diversity of Christian groups, each with its own beliefs, practices, and sacred texts. There was no New Testament. There were many other books, gospels, epistles, and so forth, other than those that would eventually become the New Testament as we know it today. These other books were widely read and fervently followed by various groups of early Christians.<BR> <BR>Some of these early Christian groups held beliefs that today would be considered bizarre. Some of them believed there were two Gods, not one, and some believed there might be twelve, or as many as thirty gods. Some believed that a malicious deity, rather than one true God, created the world. Some taught that Jesus' death and resurrection had nothing to do with salvation. Still others insisted that Jesus never really died at all. If such beliefs were once common, why do they no longer exist? What were these other books which were considered as Christian &quot;Scriptures&quot;? What did these other Scriptures say? Do they still exist?<BR> <BR>Ehrman's book is about the struggle for orthodoxy, or &quot;right belief,&quot; in early Christianity. You will see the process by which certain Christian beliefs gained legitimacy, while others were relegated to be mere footnotes to history. You will see how Christianity developed in those early years, hear about the early Christian writings, many lost to history but some newly discovered, and you will witness the development of the New Testament into an approved canon of Scripture. But how did this take place? Who decided which books should be included in the today's Canon? Since there were so many books available at the time, who decided, and on what grounds, which should be included? How do we know they got it right? Many of the early writings were known to be forgeries. How can we sure that forgeries weren't included in the New Testament?<BR> <BR>Along the way in this adventure story you'll meet the Ebionites who kept Jewish customs and strictly followed the Jewish laws. They thought that Jesus was the most righteous man on earth and because of this was &quot;adopted&quot; by God to be his son when he was baptized by John the Baptist. They denied that Jesus was himself divine, but insisted that he was fully human and the result of a sexual union between Joseph and Mary. They did not hold to the doctrine of the virgin birth.<BR> <BR>You'll meet the Marcionites, whose founder, Marcion, argued that the Christian God of love could not have also been the Creator God of the Old Testament. He believed that the gospel of Jesus Christ is entirely a gospel of love to the exclusion of the Mosaic Law. He believed that the original gospel of Jesus had been corrupted by Judaizing tendencies among the earliest disciples and that the Old Testament had no validity for Christians.<BR> <BR>And you'll meet the Gnostic Christians. They believed in a pervasive dualism. Good and evil, light and darkness, truth and falsehood, spirit and matter were opposed to one another in human experience as being and nonbeing. The created universe and human experience were characterized by a radical disjunction between the spiritual, which was real, and the physical, which was illusory. This disjunction resulted from a cosmic tragedy, described in a variety of ways by gnostic mythology, as a consequence of which sparks of deity became entrapped in the physical world. Ehrman discusses the Nag Hammadi documents, a group of gnostic writings which were found in 1945 and now constitute the only significant body of gnostic works known to modern scholars.<BR> <BR>For thosewho want a mystery with controversial overtones, an entire chapter is devoted to the Morton Smith affair and the alleged Secret Gospel of Mark. Smith was a renowned professor of ancient history at Columbia University. Some years ago he spent time in scholarly research at Mar Saba, a famous Orthodox monastery, some twelve miles from Jerusalem. There he claimed to have discovered a previously unknown letter by Clement of Alexandria, an important early church father of the third century. In this letter, Clement goes on to quote two passages from a Secret Gospel of Mark, both dealing with activities in which Jesus was involved. The story involves Jesus becoming &quot;acquainted with a young man who loves him and comes to him wearing nothing but a linen cloth over his naked body. Jesus then spends the night with him, teaching him about the mystery of the Kingdom.&quot; Smith's interpretation of this story, including his suggestion regarding homoerotic overtones, created a furor in the academic community. The question is, as Ehrman notes: &quot;Is this an authentic letter of Clement, or was it forged? And if it was forged, forged by whom?&quot;<BR> <BR>In summary, Ehrman's book considers the varieties of belief and practice in the early days of Christianity, before the church had decided what was theologically acceptable and determined which books should be included in its canon of Scripture. Part of the struggle over belief and practice in the early church was over what could be legitimately accepted as &quot;Christian&quot; and what should be condemned as &quot;heresy.&quot; It considers the struggle for &quot;orthodoxy,&quot; that is, what beliefs are &quot;right&quot; or &quot;true,&quot; and the attempt to label, spurn, and overthrow &quot;heresy,&quot; that is, what beliefs are &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;false.&quot; Christians today typically think of the New Testament as the basis for a correct understanding of the faith. But what was Christianity like before there was a New Testament? Read Professor Ehrman's book and you may discover some clues.	2003-09-27

So, when I was asked to read and review his latest work, a nonfiction book dealing with one of the most controversial topics in America today, that of capital punishment, I eagerly anticipated the opportunity to find out what this bestselling author-lawyer had to say on the subject. I was not disappointed. Turow's very short treatise on the \\"ultimate punishment\\" (only about 120 pages of actual discussion) immediately brings the controversy into focus and lays out the arguments on both sides of the issue.<BR> <BR>Admitting that initially he was an \\"agnostic\\" regarding the death penalty, Turow was appointed to serve on the Illinois Commission on Capital Punishment by then-Governor George Ryan, who had declared a moratorium on further executions in Illinois on January 31, 2000, a decision that was heavily criticized by many both in his own state and also nationwide. Ryan's justification for his action was that the Illinois' capital justice system was \\"fraught with error.\\" Shortly after he issued the moratorium, Governor Ryan put together a fourteen-member Commission to look into the matter of reforming the system. Former prosecutor and now-defense attorney Scott Turow has used his experience serving on the Commission to examine the very serious debate over the death penalty in \\"Ultimate Punishment.\\"<BR> <BR>Turow's examination of capital punishment is not merely theoretical. He has been directly involved in death penalty cases, including successfully representing two different individuals convicted in death-penalty prosecutions. In other words, he can speak from practical experience and not just from the ivory tower of academic debate. Along the way, the reader will get a brief overview of the history of the capital punishment debate in America as well as insights into the pros and cons that have divided those in favor of the death penalty and those opposed to it. To his credit, I found Turow to be profoundly fair in his analysis of both sides of the argument.<BR> <BR>One senses in this book that for the author this has been a very personal quest for wisdom regarding the matter of capital punishment. One can sense a continuing wrestling with the issue over a lengthy period of time. This book seems to be no \\"rush to judgment\\" on the part of Scott Turow. His writing at times is very introspective and at points, one might say, it is a clinical study in self-analysis involving very private ethical conflicts over a matter of supreme importance. He discusses the ordinary elements in the debate -- conviction of the innocent, deterrence, recidivism, and redemption -- but he also pays attention to the victims and their concerns, and how these concerns should be addressed in the calculus of the debate.<BR> <BR>The death penalty as a form of punishment is not a subject one should take lightly. For decades, I have publicly debated the issue, written about it, and agonized over my position regarding it. Ultimately, I decided that capital punishment as a punitive practice should be discarded by society, not because it was cruel and unusual, and not because it didn't really deter, but simply because, since the right to life as a natural right is not derived from the State, the State had no right to take a human life. While Turow does not address the natural right argument in his book, he does discuss one aspect of the controversy to which I had not in the past given serious thought, namely the matter of \\"moral proportion\\" or \\"moral order.\\" If nothing else, I thank him for bringing this matter to my attention for further thought.<BR> <BR>After the Commission finished its task of investigation and discussion, Turow says in the final pages of the text, \\"when...called upon...to offer a definitive judgment on the death penalty, a number of my fellow commissioners revised their positions. But I appear to have finally come to rest on the issue. Today, I would still do as I did when...asked whether Illinois should retain capital punishment.\\" How did novelist-lawyer Scott Turow vote on the issue? Well, you'll just have to read the book to find out. I'm not going to tell you.<BR> <BR>At the end of the book, Turow includes a copy of the Preamble to the Report of the Illinois Governor's Commission on Capital Punishment, issued in April of 2002, with the suggested recommendations of the Commission. If capital punishment is to remain the policy of the day, then the recommendations made by the Commission demand everyone's attention, no matter what state they reside in, simply because the ultimate punishment, if it is to be fairly and rationally applied, needs to meet the highest standards of justice possible. Also, for those who want to go beyond Turow's brief discussion of the subject, the book includes thirty-eight pages of notes with citations to legal cases and text references, many of them available on the Internet.<BR> <BR>In summary, this is a book to be recommended to all Americans because the issue is timely and very important. Turow has made a significant contribution to the subject of criminal justice and he is to be commended on his sober and impartial presentation.	2003-09-22

According to him, we are entering the age of the New Brain where new technologies like genetic mapping and imaging technology will reveal to us for the first time the mysterious secrets hidden within our skulls. And he is superbly qualified to lead us on this adventure into neuroscience.<br />Dr. Restak is a neurologist and neuropsychiatrist and an expert in brain function and the ongoing research of brain physiology and development. He is a clinical professor of neurology at George Washington Medical Center in the nation's capital and author of more than 15 books on the brain and brain function and appears often in the national media as a popular commentator on scientific research.<br />What, in general, is the book about? Well, it is about genetic mapping, imaging technology, psychopharmacology, the fact that our brains are working differently from how they did a century ago, in what manner and why the demands of our modern world are bringing about changes in the brain itself, the dramatic new treatments that can repair damage in the brain, the way new drugs can influence how the brain operates and what behaviors can and will result, and the probability that technology, rather than biology, will play the major role in the evolution of the human brain.<br />This is a compact book (only 212 pages of text) for books dealing with such complex topics, but that may well be to its advantage. It is, after all, written for the ordinary person and not the expert and therein lies its value. Members of the general public need to know what is going on in the area of modern brain research and what impact some of the new technologies in neuroscience may have on their lives. Furthermore, there are potential misuses of and abuses in some of these technologies, there are moral or ethical issues present, and all of us need to have enough knowledge so we can make informed decisions about how we want to permit this new research to affect our lives.<br />Rather than attempt to provide an overview of all or most of the major topics in Restak's book, let me focus briefly on three revelations that Restak presents from the current research which are sure to be controversial and I found particularly intriguing.<br />The first one is that it may be possible that brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can indicate when you are telling the truth and when you are lying, a tool that would certainly be valuable to a prosecutor and jury if evidence from such a technique was ever accepted by courts of law. Another technique called Brain Fingerprinting, which detects changes in the brain's electrical activity, has already been used in criminal investigations and Restak cites one example where the investigation led to a life sentence in prison. Interesting stuff, that. And the efficacy of such tools will surely be widely debated on the popular media talk-shows.<br />Another controversial area that Restak explores is that of the influence of violence in the media on brain physiology and behavior. There are, he notes, more than 1,000 studies which support the conclusion &quot;that when children watch violent media they become more aggressive.&quot; Without getting into the matter of TV or movie censorship, Restak presents some rather powerful evidence and says &quot;...we know that watching violence -- or even just imagining it -- reduces the functional activity of those parts of our brain that are normally enlisted to inhibit violent impulses.&quot; He concludes that &quot;From a practical point of view, it makes a lot of sense...to avoid vivid images of events that, according to what we're learning from new brain research, can lead to psychological harm.&quot; I suspect we'll hear a lot more about this research in the future and it will be widely debated.<br />My personal favorite, however, is his brief discussion regarding the two methods that have traditionally been used to teach children to read. The controversy over which teaching method is best -- phonics or whole-word (aka &quot;look-say&quot;) -- has raged for decades. I spent over seventeen years in the public schools and was a strong advocate of phonics, finding myself decidedly in the minority all that time. Now, according to Restak, brain research may have decided the issue. The question he asks is: &quot;Which of the two methods corresponds most closely to what happens in the brain during reading?&quot; The answer, Restak says, is that &quot;recent fMRI studies have largely come down in favor of phonics.&quot; I just knew that some day my position on the matter would be vindicated by science. And so it seems.<br />The only criticism I have of the book regards its subtitle, &quot;How the Modern Age is Rewiring Your Mind.&quot; As a philosopher in the tradition of Classical Realism, I make a distinction in kind between the human brain and the human mind. The human brain may be &quot;rewiring&quot; itself, but the human mind cannot do so. It is understandable, however, why Dr. Restak fails to make this distinction; unfortunately, most empirical scientists today also fail to make it. It is interesting, though, that while he uses the term &quot;mind&quot; in his subtitle, no where else in the book do I find him using that term.<br />This book is a good read. And, I think, an important one considering the nature of the topic and its significance to all our lives. It is generally nontechnical and easily understood, but be aware that it is really an overview of a deeply complex subject. I highly recommend it to everyone.	2003-08-24
US	52858812	R2150X9EAIMUPW	0805070966	428081766	Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age	Books	5	60	76	N	N	Something we all need to think about	Bill McKibben's latest book, \\"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age,\\" raises some fundamental questions about who we are, what we are, and how we may be affected by the biotechnologies which we already possess and those which are just over the horizon. The author takes us on an expedition into the world of genetic research, nanotechnology and robotics.<br />This is a passionate book and a disturbing book and one that presents what we in the \\"argumentation trade\\" might call a \\"persuasive\\" argument, that is, a presentation of facts which are used, not to support a conclusion that may be true or false, but used to support a conclusion promoting a particular policy or course of action.<br />\\"Enough\\" is also a revealing book, a hard and detailed look at our rapid acceleration into technologies which may have permanent and adverse effects on the future of human beings; indeed, these technologies have the potential to affect what it means to be human at all. Because he perceives this to be a threatening situation, McKibben discusses technologies such as germline engineering and therapeutic cloning, warning that they represent a slippery slope that may make more dangerous and harmful technologies possible and even acceptable.<br />\\"[I]f we aggressively pursue any or all of several new technologies now before us,\\" the author says, \\"we may alter our relationship not with the rest of nature but with ourselves. First human genetic engineering and then advanced forms of robotics and nanotechnology will call into question, often quite explicitly, our understanding of what it means to be a human being.\\"<br />McKibben acquaints us with microscopic nanobots cruising our bloodstreams, attacking pathogens within our bodies and building new cells. And with children born so genetically enhanced that they will never be able to believe that they reached success as musicians or artists or athletes or whatever because there was something unique in them and a hunger to reach the pinnacle of their ability through their own choice and desire.<br />The author tackles what it means to be human, pointing out how these new technologies threaten our very identity as human beings. \\"What if we have been programmed,\\" he asks, \\"or at least must suspect each time we choose a path that we have been nudged in that direction by our engineered cells? Who then 'are we'?\\"<br />One of the more interesting arguments that McKibben makes, in my opinion, has to do with the matter of \\"choice,\\" an issue with which libertarians are always concerned. Libertarian-minded thinkers tend to be among the strongest advocates of modern technologies and tend to believe that the free market will police itself in regard to any dangers which may result from their use.<br />More often than not, libertarians accuse those who oppose or may merely question the effects of new technologies of being Luddites, a name attributed to that infamous group of early nineteenth century workers who protested against the introduction of new labor-saving technologies in the factories of that period.<br />But McKibben argues that some of these new biotechnologies are really \\"anti-choice.\\" He points out that \\"In widespread use, they will first rob parents of their liberty, and then strip freedom from every generation that follows. In the end, they will destroy forever the very possibility of meaningful choice.\\"<br />I think that's a point that needs to be thoughtfully and seriously considered, especially by those who are, like I am, more or less on the libertarian side of the socio-political spectrum.<br />McKibben is not a naive thinker. He realizes that there is no limit to human aspirations or desires. And our ability to discover new scientific facts and to invent new technologies seems unlimited. But can we draw a line and say this far and no further? Can we say, this is enough? The author answers yes, and argues that only by staying human can we find true meaning in our lives. What sets a human beingapart from other beings in this world of ours? McKibben argues that it is our power of self-limitation. \\"We need to do an unlikely thing,\\" he says. \\"We need to survey the world we now inhabit and proclaim it good. Good enough.\\"<br />While allowing that many of these new technologies may hold the promise to cure disease and provide other benefits, they also offer problematic choices such as the capacity to choose a child's gender, the power to boost human intelligence and, what may be the nightmare of all nightmares, the option of \\"improving\\" or \\"perfecting\\" human beings. And, I have always argued and will continue to do so: just because we can do something does not mean it is something we should do or need to do. I find myself having to agree with McKibben when he concludes, \\"I think the stakes in this argument are absurdly high, nothing less than the meaning of being human. Must we forever grow in reach and power? Or can we, should we, ever say,'Enough'?\\" Maybe so, maybe in this case, maybe at this time.<br />This is a book that should be read by everyone who is concerned about the future of the human species.	2003-04-12
US	52858812	R2V96822OHUXX8	0374171432	13684786	A Free Nation Deep in Debt: The Financial Roots of Democracy	Books	5	21	21	N	N	The Relationship of Public Finance and Political Freedom	&quot;A Free Nation Deep in Debt&quot; is James Macdonald's first literary contribution to the field of political economy and it is rich in historical detail, a fact which may make it a challenging read for anyone unacquainted with ordinary economic history and its specific historiography. Macdonald, an investment banker for many years who now lives in Oxford, England, discusses the idea that the way a country borrows its money is associated with what kind of government it has. In his discussion, Macdonald traces the evolution of public debt from antiquity to the present, arguing that public finance and political freedom are more closely interrelated than most people realize.<br />For those who like some structure in a book of this complexity, it can easily be divided into an introduction and four main sections. The first seven pages, with the title &quot;Introduction: The Financial Roots of Democracy,&quot; sketches out what is to come, providing the reader with a framework for the coming text and raising the essential questions with which the author will wrestle.<br />The first section traces the history of public finance and political freedom from the end of the Bronze Age to the end of the Dark Ages, contrasts two different types of finances -- tribal and imperial, explains the historic advantages of autocratic government, considers the critical period when some of the emerging societies settled down and civilized themselves without losing their political freedom, and, in regard to the so-called Dark Ages, asks why they had a more intense and enduring effect in western Europe than in other places. This initial section sets the stage for a comprehensive description of the relationship of public finance and political freedom in the Middle Ages and modern times.<br />The second section deals with medieval Europe. It was to be the role of medieval Italian city-states to bring back the idea of democratic public financing and modify it so it could become a workable plan for public financing. According to Macdonald, &quot;The system that they created, although in one way fatally flawed, set off a chain of events with results that no one could have predicted.&quot; The third section of the book continues the discussion of public finance by looking at the attempts of other European states to come to terms with the implications of the Italian strategy.<br />The fourth and final section considers events after the French Revolution, and the author suggests that &quot;The outcome of the Napoleonic Wars demonstrated the superiority of a political system based on the alliance of parliamentary government and public debt, but now there was a new question: Would a system created in a world of restricted citizenship and limited franchise prove compatible with universal suffrage. It was the role of the nineteenth century to find a solution to this problem. In the devastating wars of the first half of the twentieth century, this solution was put to the test.&quot; And Macdonald concludes that &quot;The First World War was the apotheosis of 'democratic' public finance, the Second its swan song.&quot;<br />Throughout the reading of &quot;A Free Nation Deep in Debt,&quot; one is struck continually by both the historical detail the author has uncovered and the factual surprises which he springs on the reader. How many of us realize, for instance, that the problem of public financing was intimately related to the fall of Rome or that in the eighteenth century it was commonly accepted that public debt and political liberty were intimately related? Regarding our own time and country, how many of us realize that the role played by the United States in World War I was funded with public debt?<br />I will leave it to the experts in economic theory and history to evaluate what appear to be Macdonald's conclusions in this romp through political economy from ancient Mesopotamia to the United States in the twentieth century. Has public borrowing from citizens in times of war gone hand in hand with modern democracy, as Macdonald argues? Does he present a compelling case showing why a democratic government is able to borrow more cheaply from its citizen-lenders than an autocratic state who does not consider its citizens to be equals? Was, in fact, World War II the &quot;swan song&quot; of democratic public financing? And, if true, has this occurred as a result of a decline in the public's trust of government, particularly in Western nations, combined with increasing globalization of the economy?<br />Readers can decide for themselves whether Macdonald adequately answers the above questions, as well as the other questions he tackles. Suffice to say, &quot;A Free Nation Deep in Debt&quot; is a comprehensive and detailed consideration regarding a certain aspect of economic history, specifically the relationship between public financing and political freedom. Certainly an interesting read, but let the reader beware. This scholarly book is definitely not Sunday afternoon &quot;leisure&quot; reading.<br />Fortunately for the reader, this book is enhanced with a detailed appendix of notes on currencies which describes them and sets out their relationships in historical context. Furthermore, a helpful glossary is provided which explains the technical terms used in the text, although the educated reader will not have much difficulty with the terms as they are used since they are explained as they occur within the text itself. The author has also provided thirty-five pages of notes, a 21-page bibliography, and a useful index with both major and minor topics listed.	2003-02-09

And Nassim Nicholas Taleb's new book &quot;Fooled by Randomness&quot; deals extensively with those topics for this is a book about how, in both business and in life in general, we perceive and deal with luck or, as the author says, it is a book &quot;about luck disguised and perceived as non-luck...and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as non-randomness.&quot; Moreover, &quot;It manifests itself in the shape of the lucky fool, defined as a person who benefited from a disproportionate share of luck but attributes his success to some other, generally very precise, reason.&quot;<br />Taleb, a professional trader and mathematics professor with an M.B.A. from the Wharton School and a Ph.D. from the University of Paris, extensively examines what randomness means in business and in life and why human beings are so prone to mistake dumb luck for consummate skill. His book is an unconventional and highly personal exploration of the nature of randomness that wanders from the court of Croesus and a visit from Solon, said to be the wisest man in the ancient world, to trading rooms in New York and London, to discussions of Russian roulette, Monte Carlo math, the survivorship bias, Darwin's theory of evolution, the problem of induction, baseball great Yogi Berra, the philosophy of Karl Popper, and a whole lot more. The range of information and knowledge displayed by the author is impressive.<br />The obvious background against which the book is set is the world of trading, but the real background is the whole mosaic of our common life. One reason the book is fascinating is Taleb's ability to make seemingly esoteric mathematical ideas entirely relevant in evaluating and understanding everything from the stock market to the successes of ordinary people, and &quot;the lucky fool in the right place at the right time.&quot; In an uncertain world where much depends on chance events, success is not always explained by the concept of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; but, rather, by the concept of &quot;survival of the luckiest.&quot; How do chance, luck, randomness, and probability impact our lives? Taleb has some ideas about the answers to that question.<br />Don't be fooled by the brevity of this book, a mere 196 pages of textual content. Within its pages is much to ponder and I suggest reading this book once very rapidly to view the broad canvas upon which the author paints his concepts and examples, then go back and read it slowly to grasp its major ideas and important details, and then spend some time merely thinking about the conclusions, consequences, and ramifications of the notions put forth by the author. &quot;Fooled by Randomness&quot; is a fascinating read and, unusual in a book about such complex topics, an entertaining read as well.	2002-11-24

And what a job she does in her new book on the basics of general economics. This work is indeed an easy read on a complex subject but Coyle never insults the intelligence of her readers and fully intends to explain in a readable style exactly what the study of economics is all about.<br />Right at the beginning, Dr. Coyle tells us precisely what she intends her book to do: \\"This book aims to demonstrate that economics is essentially a particular way of thinking about the world that can be applied to almost any situation affecting individuals, companies, industries, and governments.\\" Then, to make sure we all understand that the study of economics is not just for the professional or the academic but has a broader horizon, she insists that economics is \\"the subject for you whatever your interests and concerns\\" and that her objective is \\"to provide a new light and refreshing appetizer that might satisfy delicate appetites but also encourage some readers to develop a taste for more.\\"<br />One of the things that makes this book so appealing is that Dr. Coyle uses our ordinary life experiences to allow us to grasp many of the major concepts of economics. She does discuss sex and illegal drugs and how economics applies to them, but she also has chapters on sports, music, energy, auctions, war games, movies, the Internet, weather, and other common topics with which we are very familiar, all utilized as a means to introduce, explain and describe various technical terms and concepts at different points in the book.<br />For instance, the first chapter of the book, titled \\"Sex: Can you have too much of a good thing?,\\" introduces the concepts of \\"demand\\" and \\"supply,\\" as well \\"inelastic supply of labor\\" and \\"product differentiation.\\" Chapter 2, which is about illegal drugs, introduces the concepts of \\"market,\\" \\"externality,\\" \\"price elasticity of demand,\\" and \\"cost-benefit analysis.\\" A later chapter on sports explains the concept of \\"economics of scale,\\" while the chapter on music explains the idea of \\"marginal cost,\\" and the chapter on immigration explains the concept known as the \\"lump of labor fallacy.\\" Furthermore, she provides an excellent description of the concept of the \\"public good\\" in the chapter on disease, and her discussion of this concept will be of particular interest to libertarians and classical liberals.<br />There are a few things I found particularly helpful during my reading of this book. The most important to me as a general reader was that the major terms and concepts of economics were set in boldface type as they were introduced in the text. This meant I paid particular attention to them as I was reading and realized they were important to understanding what was being said. Next in importance, at the back of the book is an appendix outlining and explaining the \\"Ten Rules of Economic Thinking,\\" a section I thought helpfully summed up many of the main points expressed in the text. Finally, a glossary is provided which further explains and expands the major terms and concepts used throughout the book. I wish this sort of format was used more often in books on otherwise difficult subjects. And of course the book includes the usual bibliography (with many Internet websites also provided) and a well-organized comprehensive index.	2002-10-15

The biotechnology revolution is upon us, says Francis Fukuyama in his new book \\"Our Posthuman Future,\\" and we had better begin to deal with the challenging social, political, and economic issues which will be raised by the changes to come.<br />Fukuyama points out that we are already a society that is widely using and abusing drugs like Prozac and Ritalin to modify behavior and psychological states and we now seem to be all too eager to employ our expanding knowledge of human genetics to influence everything from increasing intelligence to prolonging life. But these may be the least of the problems we face in the future. The author also discusses such controversial issues as eugenics, the prospects for germline enhancement, embryonic stem-cell research, human cloning, and \\"designer babies.\\" There are sound reasons to put limits on biotechnology and these limits can be and need to be enforced. This is, in my opinion, Fukuyama's main thesis in his book, and with this I wholeheartedly agree.<br />\\"Our Posthuman Future\\" deserves to be read by all those who are concerned about the direction in which biotechnology is going. No, let me go further. This book needs to be read by all thinking human beings. The reason is simple: human beings, or human nature as we have understood it up to now, may be at stake. Fukuyama is no Luddite, neither am I. But the simple fact is this: just because something in science or technology \\"can\\" be done, does not mean it \\"should\\" be done. When we learn that lesson, maybe the world will be a better place.	2002-04-24

I received an e-mail from Rand and Rose Flem-Ath informing me that they had written a book about the search for Atlantis and wondering why we didn't have it in The Radical Academy Bookstore. They  pointed out that Graham Hancock, whose books we do feature, based some of  his work on their book, &quot;When the Sky Fell: In Search of  Atlantis.&quot;<br />Truth to tell, I was unfamiliar with the Flem Ath's book.  So I ordered a copy (from Amazon, of course) and two days later sat down in  the morning to begin reading it. Well, that day's usual work was shot! I  could not put the book down and finished it in late afternoon. What a book!  Not very long, but definitely interesting.<br />I realize that many scientists  and historians will take them to task, claiming the book is unscientific  and unhistorical, just another &quot;pop&quot; book on a topic already  settled. I should think they would know better, of course. As the saying  goes: &quot;Deal with the evidence, stupid!&quot;<br />The Flem-Aths do a heck  of a job with the evidence. Rather than merely dismissing the book out of  hand, I would like to see the scientists and the historians &quot;deal with  the evidence.&quot; I am not saying that what the Flem-Aths propose is the  final say on the subject. But they have done a compelling job of presenting  the evidence for their case. And that's what the professionals should deal  with.<br />The Flem-Aths claim to have uncovered the real cause of the ice  ages. They analyze the identical myths told among primitive peoples who  could have had no contact with one another. They deal with the fascinating  issue of the Piri Re'is map, a map that seems to show the continent of  Antartica in its original state before the modern world even  &quot;discovered&quot; that land of ice. The authors also deal with some  other mysteries that have intrigued us, such as how to explain the  simultaneous rise of agriculture around the world and the strange history  of the Sphinx in Egypt.<br />I highly recommend this book. (And it's not very  expensive, either.) Jonathan Dolhenty, Ph.D., Executive Director, The  Center for Applied Philosophy	1999-03-05
