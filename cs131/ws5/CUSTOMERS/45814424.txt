As a journalist, Berendt has an instinct for a good story and the observational powers of a great novelist. This book is extraordinary because of the legion of interesting and eccentric characters and the magical descriptions of the legendary town of Savannah, Georgia. It is easy to understand why many people believed the book to be a novel, because it reads like a good crime thriller, but everything Berendt reports is absolutely true. In the hands of John Berendt travel writing transforms to a new genre, which makes for excellent reading.<br /><br />One hears about the charms of the American Deep South - that time moves at a slower pace, that southerner's remain wary of visiting Yankees and the Civil War, though fought and lost 150 years ago, that original feeling of humiliation remains. This is where America's true aristocracy reside, practicing age-old traditions and possessing most of the eccentricities that we've come to expect from the aristocracy. But these eccentricities are not pathological, in my opinion, but signs of culture and character.<br /><br />The core of this story centres on the character, Jim Williams, a tall, dark, sinister looking southern, self-made gentleman, who smokes expensive King Edward cigarillos and resides in a beautiful renovated Victorian mansion that is tastefully furnished with rare antiques that he has purchased from all over the world. William's is a dealer in rare antiques, a specialist restorer, who has made millions from his trade. A young man by the name of Danny Hansford, known around town as \\"A walking streak of sex\\" works for William's, and is known to drink and drug, drive his Chevy at top speed through the streets of Savannah, shoot pistols off in the middle of the night and is highly promiscuous - Danny is a disaster waiting to happen...eventually a scandal erupts that keeps the town talking for years.<br /><br />What I had to keep telling myself while reading the book was that all these characters are real people: Luther Diggers, an inventor who walks flies instead of dogs', the Lady Chablis, \\"The Grand Empress of Savannah\\", a beautiful drag Queen and, my personal favourite, Joe Odom, a lawyer, real estate broker and entrepreneur whose life, literally, is one big party, an easy-going gentleman whose charisma and personal magnetism is truly extraordinary - this man's attitude to life is inspiring - the epitome of southern charm and hospitality.<br /><br />This book had been recommended to me many times over the years, and I never got around to reading it. _Midnight_ was a great surprise and exceeded my expectations.

Ellis has taken the first person narrative in the novel to a new level, cleverly mixing realism and the supernatural, confessional writing with celebrity gossip and urbane, suburban humour with the utterly macabre. The author's talent for writing terror is without question, i.e., American Psycho and particularly some of the short stories in The Informers, however, Ellis' true talent is his ability to satirize modern western culture, pointing out its inconsistencies, hypocrisies and insanities, revealing the irony in our values and making his observations seem very funny, uncomfortably funny. Lunar Park is horror in the suburbs with a humorous twist, yet at the same time, it is a serious and moving portrayal of drug use, personal loneliness and the dysfunctional modern family.<br /><br />Ellis begins the tale in a confessional style, giving the reader an inside look at his instant success with the novel Less than Zero, and his rocket ride into celebrity, including all the debasement - cocaine, orgies, literary groupies, twenty-thousand a week condos in the Hampton's - that one associates with major rock stars. Ellis did become a literary sensation, the alleged spokesperson for the young debauched 80's generation. The story of his last book tour is particularly painful as he was stoned and plastered most of the time. His father dies in 1992, and his world really crashes, when his ex-girlfriend, movie star, informs him that she's pregnant with his child. Of course he denies responsibility, blaming another man, but the tests proof he's the father, and eventually he marries her as she whisks him off to the suburbs to save him from himself, with promises of sobriety.<br /><br />Everything seems to going fine, writing a new book, a teaching job at the local Arts college, except he doesn't get along with his 11 year old son, he and his wife are in marriage counselling, (he sleeps in the spare room) and he is trying to have an affair with one of his students. At a Halloween party at their home, he packs his nose with a drug store, slugs down the vodka and attempts to seduce his student in the bathroom, and suddenly strange things start to occur. His stepdaughter's robotic toy bird becomes nasty, a man shows up to the party looking exactly like Patrick Bateman, the famous serial killer in his novel, American Psycho, and the lights in his home begin to do strange things. Is it the drugs and alcohol making him paranoid or something more sinister? In fact the novel just gets stranger and stranger until poor Ellis free falls almost into oblivion.<br /><br />What I found most enjoyable about this novel was the fine line Ellis walked between the incredible and so-called reality (are these events really happening) and his caustic observations on suburban middle-class values. These observations are curiously disturbing and hilarious at the same time - he knows how to write black comedy.<br /><br />I believe this is Bret Easton Ellis' best work to date.in marriage counselling, (he sleeps in the spare room) and he is trying to have an affair with one of his students.

Norman Malcolm introduced the two philosophers and during the following months the two men had numerous philosophical discussions while on casual walks and at Malcolm's home. At Cornell University, these discussions were either formal or informal, revealing, to a large extent, intensity of thought, and immediacy and pending danger that is so characteristic of Wittgenstein's personality. These discussions influenced Bouwsma to a great degree in terms of his work habits and approach to philosophy in general.<br /><br />Although short in length, these discussions reveal a mature Wittgenstein, a man at the end of his life that had not lost any of his concentration nor passion for life. Wittgenstein discusses many topics from ethics, language, Dostoevsky, Frege, Russell, Descartes, Kierkegaard, religious truth, faith, and Plato. Bouwsma and Wittgenstein would commence on one of their walks and Wittgenstein would ask Bouwsma to choose a topic for discussion, and without anytime for reflection, Wittgenstein would charge directly to the heart of the subject, stopping in mid-step to make a relevant point, gesticulating in the air while observing his audience of one to ensure his student was comprehending his words. Reading these short \\"notes\\" one can imagine and almost feel the power and concentration of the discussions.<br /><br />Despite being very sick, Wittgenstein continued to be almost fanatical about cleanliness, vigorously scrubbing himself for a good hour on a daily basis. Miss Anscombe, one of the philosopher's literary executors, told Bouwsma that Wittgenstein was known back in the Cambridge days to heat several buckets of water for his daily baths. She also said that during the war, he once returned the money Cambridge paid him for his lectures: Wittgenstein said, \\"The lectures were no good, not worth the money\\". But as Anscombe said, \\"They were, of course, better than any others given.\\" It is this kind of little story that makes biography a worthwhile reading experience, illustrating a lot about the character of the man in just a few words.<br /><br />Years later, Bouswma typed these \\"notes\\" and decided to send them to Wittgenstein's nephew in Vienna, Thomas Stonborough. After reading them he immediately wrote a letter to Bouswma stating that (it) was \\"The best thing written on him I know of.\\"<br /><br />One of the things that intrigued Thomas Stonborough was why Wittgenstein had such an interest in Bouswma, as this was unusual for the philosopher to let an acquaintance into his life. All the philosopher could come up with was his honesty and love of philosophy. This honesty and irrefutable love of philosophy certainly comes through in the writing.

This is a truly incredible volume of recollections from five individuals who knew Wittgenstein in one capacity or another, giving the reader a new perspective or human side to a philosopher that is shrouded in misunderstanding and myth. On the surface, the text does not comment on Wittgenstein's philosophy as such, however, from these recollections and conversations, if one reads between the lines, so to speak, gains a possible unique access point into the philosopher's thought processes, revealing a religious and somewhat mystical Wittgenstein, a man deeply concerned about his fellow man and the conditions of the modern world.<br /><br />The recollections begin with his older sister's memoir, Hermine Wittgenstein, and her view of her little brother shows nothing less than admiration, her genuine concern for his well being and acute observations about his incredible capacity for work and his constant striving for perfection in himself and in everything he attempted. At the outset of WW1, Wittgenstein was not medically fit for service, thus he volunteered, placing himself, as the war progressed, closer and closer to the front lines. She found it humorous that the military authorities believed Wittgenstein to be avoiding battle, when in fact he wanted to put himself squarely in the middle of it. In the end he succeeded, and won medals for bravery and the admiration from his fellow soldiers. Hermine's recollections of Wittgenstein designing and building her sisters famous house in Vienna, reveals again, the razor sharp thought and perfection of the philosopher, as the house, architecturally, was truly an example of modern style that was spawned and flourished in Germany and throughout Europe after the war.<br /><br />The famous literary critic and teacher, F.R. Leavis, writes an anecdotal piece that reveals Wittgenstein's \\"single-mindedness\\" and genius on many levels. As many people who knew the philosopher would testify, Wittgenstein rarely conversed philosophy but lectured, sometimes for hours, never letting anyone else get a word in edgewise. Leavis's dislike for Bertrand Russel is no secret, however it becomes even more than clear when he illustrates Wittgenstein and Russel's differences in personality, one striving for selflessness and the other immortality.<br /><br />The most revealing of all the recollections would have to be M.O'C. Drury, a student and life long friend of the philosopher who was present at his death at Cambridge. Drury would immediately, after spending anytime with Wittgenstein, return to his rooms and write down, as best he could, the subject of their discussion. He continued this habit over many years, which shows Wittgenstein's value of the truth, his views on music, and the constant struggle with his writing. I would have to admit that Dr. Drury's recollections are the clearest and better written of the entire group. Conversely, Rush Rhee's \\"Postscript\\" is an exceptional analysis of Wittgenstein's struggle with self-deception and his Jewishness.<br /><br />This is a fine volume and the type of memoir that one can return to time and again and find new perspectives on the philosopher.<br /><br />Excellent.ut lectured, sometimes for hours, never letting anyone else get a word in edgewise.

In the news last week, an American turned al- Qaeda terrorist, warned Australians, particularly Melbournians, in a video broadcast across the Arab and western world, that an attack was imminent in the not so distant future. As a result, security measures across the city have doubled, particularly with the Common Wealth Games scheduled to open next year. The London bombings of a few months ago confirmed that the terrorists mean business, and preventing further bloodshed, stopping the terrorists, is of the highest priority. Dying to Win is an incredibly well researched investigation into the nature of suicide terrorism. Robert Pape has shattered the received wisdom concerning the nature of these killers and what drives them to perform these terrible acts. His research has also led him to a possible solution to combat terror, which those in power should heed.<br /><br />Why was Australians targeted by suicide terrorists? Investigations have shown that it was the Indonesian terrorist organization, Jemaah Islamiya (JI), however the training, financing and technological expertise, came from al-Qaeda, in order to punish Australians for their military involvement in the invasion of Afghanistan. This car bombing of an over crowded disco, where Australians were known to frequent for many years, was a devastating blow and the motive was clear, military presence in the Muslim homeland, Saudi Arabia and others throughout the Persian Gulf, will not be tolerated.<br /><br />In this clear and concisely written text, Pape has demonstrated that suicide terrorism is not motivated through a fanatic, Muslim fundamentalism, wishing to destroy our western way of life, but a direct result of military occupation in the Persian Gulf. He analyses the top terrorist organizations that use suicide terrorism as a weapon, and all of them, including the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka, Hezbollah of Lebanon, Hamas/Islamic Jihad of Palestine and al-Qaeda of Saudi Arabia use extreme measures in order to motivate the occupying military force to leave their territory.<br /><br />Our stereotypical image of a suicide terrorist is usually a young Arab boy, uneducated, poor and easily influenced by evil with nothing left to lose. However, since 1990, the standard has changed, that is, the suicide terrorist is usually educated coming from a middle-class background with no criminal record, and perceived as successful. The driving force behind the suicide is an overwhelming sense of nationalism, brought about by the humiliation created from one's home being occupied by another country. In a word, this is not about religious fanaticism, a monolith of Muslim fundamentalism threatening our Christian values and way of life, as a few neocons would have us believe, but about military occupation. The research is impeccable and it speaks for itself.<br /><br />Pape believes our presence in Iraq has only fuelled the fire as the amount of suicide bombings there have quadrupled. His solution is gradual withdraw of all Persian Gulf countries, however with a military force in wait to move in if the balance of power shifts and our oil interests are threatened. He believes that \\"off-shore balancing\\", a strategy of our military in wait with diplomacy in place with Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq, ensuring the balance is maintained, democratization can develop on its own, ensuring peace throughout the region.<br /><br />The other arm of his strategy is to beef up security at home, particularly greater presence at our borders, preventing terrorists from entering our countries in the first place.<br /><br />Bottom line, suicide terrorism is motivated by nationalistic sentiments, in an effort to remove foreign powers from their homelands. It is not about religious fanaticism, but about military occupation. The result of Pape's research is very clear on this point and his proposed solution is a sane one, and one that should be considered by those in power.Pape's research is very clear on this point and his proposed solution is a sane one, and one that should be considered by those in power. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-20

However, agreement as to a correct interpretation of the philosopher's work, particularly Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and Philosophical Investigations, really depends on who you read; in fact there seems to be universal disagreement as to the \\"correct\\" reading of his work. That's why Ray Monk, the author of this text and the best selling biography of Wittgenstein, \\"A Duty of Genius\\", offers an apology in the Introduction, he writes,<br /><br />\\"It is extremely presumptuous to publish a book called How to Read Wittgenstein. I apologize in advance for doing so and want to make clear that what I offer here is only _one possible_ way of Reading Wittgenstein.\\" (P.1)<br /><br />As Wittgenstein's biographer and a professor of philosophy, Monk is more than qualified to write this book, and the interpretations he proposes are clear and illuminating.<br /><br />The text begins with a short biographical sketch of Wittgenstein, then tackles the most widely interpreted and difficult philosophical texts of the twentieth century, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Monk must be an excellent teacher because he throws light on the work, indeed clearing up a few of my own misunderstandings of the Tractatus. He explains Wittgenstein's early work and his transition period, around 1029-30, where his views on philosophy changed considerably, known as Wittgenstein's later period.<br /><br />Close to the end of Wittgenstein's life, his philosophy began to branch out in new directions. In the work, Last Writings on the Philosophy of Psychology, he discusses the notion of Imponderable Evidence. This is particularly fascinating, as he proposes evidence that can be seen as evidence for a particular judgement but cannot be described. As Monk explains, this work was an attempt to distance him from those who look to science to provide psychological insight, and \\"...those in the humanities who have become convinced that understanding another person, having access to their inner life, is possible.\\" (P.104)<br /><br />I believe Ray Monk has touched the core of Wittgenstein's philosophy, explaining many of the philosopher's difficult concepts in a very clear and highly accessible manner. This would be an advisable text for any undergraduate embarking on a Bachelors degree in philosophy.nd \\"...those in the humanities who have become convinced that understanding another person, having access to their inner life, is possible.\\" (P.104) <br /> <br />I believe Ray Monk has touched the core of Wittgenstein's philosophy, explaining many of the philosopher's difficult concepts in a very clear and highly accessible manner.

According to the editors, Anscombe and von Wright, Wittgenstein told Moore that these were his best articles.<br /><br />In entry 83, Wittgenstein writes:<br /><br />\\"The truth of certain empirical propositions belongs to our frame of reference\\".<br /><br />This is a foundationalist argument, proposing that our knowledge of the world and its truth, belongs to our particular frame of reference - context is everything, underlying all our assertions.<br /><br />Another perspective that Wittgenstein proposes is the position of Relativism: in this view there are no foundations or absolutes, truth changes with the times, circumstances and social conditions. He writes,<br /><br />65: \\"When language-games change, then there is a change in concepts, and with concepts the meaning of words change.\\"<br /><br />Interestingly, relativism is the perfect tool for the sceptic, because knowledge is depended on time and circumstances, and therefore can be sought, but never found.<br /><br />Doubt itself is depended on certainty, as one must hold a premise in order to reject it.<br /><br />115: \\"If you tried to doubt everything you would not get far as doubting anything. The game of doubting itself presupposes certainty.\\"<br /><br />In fact this, really, is the core premise of On Certainty that knowledge can only exist if doubt is possible. Doubt relies on content of what we know, our frame of reference that is inherent in all our assumptions regarding existence.<br /><br />Reading On Certainty is a stimulus for thought, pushing us to analyse our assumptions about knowledge, that truth depends on our concept frameworks through which we view the world.<br /><br />Recommended to all students of contemporary philosophy.sible.

In The Jew of Linz, Cornish carries the reader along on an extraordinary historical investigation, sweeping through 20th century philosophy and fascist ideology, making outlandish claims as to the \\"true\\" seeds that spawned Nazism and Adolph Hitler's rise to power, constructing persuasive arguments based on pure speculation and in some cases, false premises, that in the end, in his sketchy conclusion, manages not to connect the dots at all, leaving the reader disappointed and wholly unsatisfied.<br /><br />Cornish's premise is that the most original philosopher of the 20th century, Ludwig Wittgenstein, attended the same school in Linz as Adolph Hitler, and from this connection, proposes that Hitler began his hatred for the Jews because of little Ludwig and his famous Viennese family. There is a photograph that Cornish claims have undergone extensive forensic examination, and from the evidence at hand, the boy seated at arm's length from young Hitler is Wittgenstein. (They did attend the same school, but that's the extent of the connection) He speculates, contrary to other historical evidence, that the two boy's, a bully Hitler and a stammering, Wittgenstein shared musical and artistic sensibilities. This may be so, however, Cornish's speculation of a playground exchange between the two young boy's is just that, speculation. In fact there is no evidence whatsoever that Hitler had a hidden rage against the Wittgenstein family or the famous philosopher ( Hitler's Mein Kampf, for example, would have certainly mentioned this so-called rage against Wittgenstein and his family, as the entire book, for the most part, is Hitler's treatise of anger, but the madman never mentions the family!) however, Cornish bases his entire theses on this spurious premise.<br /><br />Cornish goes onto speculate that Wittgenstein was the secret communist recruiter that created the most famous English spy ring during WW2. His method of investigation is a simple process of elimination, leaving the reader cornered as to the ringleader's identity. Granted, Wittgenstein did have communist sympathies, like many noteworthy intellectuals at the time, but there is no evidence that he was a master spy for Stalin! It is true that Wittgenstein spent a short time in Russia and thought about working on one of the collective farms, (this is certainly not out of character for the moody philosopher) and was in fact asked to join the staff of the university, which he turned down, but this in no way points to him being a Stalinist and a dyed in the wool communist.<br /><br />The last third of the book is devoted to interpreting Wittgenstein's Tractatus and connecting it to Hitler's views on the Aryan race and Nazism. One has to give Cornish points for imagination, but his understanding of the Tractatus is lacking in many respects. His notions concerning Nazi ideology touches on its occult connections but his leap to the Tractatus and Wittgenstein's notions of the Self, goes way beyond the pale.<br /><br />This is conspiracy theory sensationalism at its most hysterical form. One will suspect something interesting though outlandish, then goes about searching the \\"evidence\\", picking and choosing only the data that will support the premise, ignoring all the other pertinent data to the contrary. If you enjoy conspiracy theories on par with the X-Files, this is the book for you.ered as to the ringleader's identity.

Their unique because of the informality of the delivery: reading these notes, one can almost imagine the philosopher seated in his flat at Cambridge, extemporaneously discussing the subjects of aesthetics, psychology and religious belief.<br /><br />It has been said that these particular subjects were only superficially touched upon in Wittgenstein's main works, Tractatus and Philosophical Investigations, and because of the informality of the discussions, are therefore more accessible for anyone interested in contemporary philosophy.<br /><br />Although the notes on aesthetics and religious belief are interesting, Wittgenstein's views on Freud, i.e., psychoanalysis and particularly dream language, symbology and their interpretation throws a new light on psychoanalysis, in terms of the on-going argument as to whether it can be classified a true \\"science\\". The key to psychoanalysis' power and longevity is the cleverness and charm of the various arguments it proposes. The idea that _any_ opposition to Freud is a form of \\"resistance\\" from the unconscious has persisted throughout its history. This notion, at least in the beginning of the movement, successfully thwarted any productive dialogue and criticism.<br /><br />Overall, however, Wittgenstein claimed that analysis was likely to do harm, he writes,<br /><br />\\"Because although one may discover in the course of it various things about oneself, one must have a very strong and keen and persistent criticism in order to recognize and see through the mythology that is offered or imposed on one. There is an inducement to say, `Yes, of course, it must be like that.' A powerful mythology\\" (P.52)<br /><br />Reading these informal \\"notes\\" has given me a better understanding of Wittgenstein's process of thought and investigation into these subjects.

Bouveresse tackles the Reason and Cause arguments; the `Generalizing Impulse\\" in regards to justifying a theory; and Freud's method of dream interpretation, and shows it fails on many counts when analysed against the rigours of falsification and verification.<br /><br />Although Wittgenstein views the tenets of psychoanalysis as \\"a manner of speaking\\" and not a valid science, he maintains Freud's power of persuasion and the originality of his thought. In the end, however, psychoanalysis is about persuasion, telling the analysand that such and such a thing is the \\"cause\\" of their particular malady, and influencing them to accept that diagnosis. These \\"explanations\\" have a particular charm for the analysand, whether they're actually the case or not.<br /><br />This was an interesting discussion on Freud's theories and Wittgenstein's arguments against them.

Malcolm's descriptions of Wittgenstein delivering his unorthodox lectures in the philosopher's minimalist rooms at Cambridge - students crammed sitting and standing shoulder to shoulder, the philosopher glaring at any late comer, gesticulating in silence like a suffering mime to achieve a crystalline synthesis of thought, has now become legend. Wittgenstein was an extemporaneous lecturer, never using notes, uncannily picking up the thread of his thoughts from the previous weeks lecture. Malcolm admits that he didn't really begin to understand Wittgenstein until years after attending these \\"conversations\\". However this memoir is not about Wittgenstein's philosophy, but about Wittgenstein the man, by way of personal anecdotes and an eleven-year correspondence up until only thirteen days before Wittgenstein's death from prostate cancer.<br /><br />There are many moving and humorous anecdotes in this memoir, however two in particular really stand out: While visiting Cambridge, Malcolm and his wife would occasionally have Wittgenstein over for dinner. More often than not, he would insist on doing the dishes, but preferred to do them in the bathtub with extremely hot water and a fair amount of soap. This way, he insisted, was the only method to wash dishes to ensure their utter cleanliness. He would often scold Malcolm for not drying the plates properly.  This incident may seem minor, but it really exemplifies Wittgenstein's intense character, and what ever he put his attention on, it would be done to the best of his ability.<br /><br />On one spring evening, after washing up, Wittgenstein, Malcolm and his wife set off on one of their many walks around campus. Wittgenstein began talking about the planets in the solar system and their relationships. He told Malcolm's wife that she was the sun and to continue walking; Malcolm was told he was the earth and to run around her, orbit, counter clockwise; Wittgenstein took the role of the moon, the most difficult, and ran around Malcolm at top speed. Anyone observing this spectacle from afar must have thought they were crazy, but Malcolm said it was extremely difficult and exhilarating experience.<br /><br />Overall the text is divided into three sections: a well-written biographical sketch by Wittgenstein's colleague at Cambridge, G.H. von Wright. The second section is Malcolm's moving and humorous memoir, ending in the third section with a collection of correspondence from Wittgenstein to Malcolm spanning over eleven years. It is these letters that show the human side of Wittgenstein, his tireless work ethic and his concern for the well being of his friends.<br /><br />If you have any interest in the character of this interesting philosopher, Malcolm's memoir is an excellent text.sun and to continue walking; Malcolm was told he was the earth and to run around her, orbit, counter clockwise; Wittgenstein took the role of the moon, the most difficult, and ran around Malcolm at top speed.

According to recent studies, children living below the poverty line in western democratic countries has increased rather than diminished, despite the top twenty percent of the wealthy becoming richer. There are many factors contributing to this economic chasm, but the simple fact remains, that normal working members of our society are finding it much more difficult to make ends meet. Unemployment rises along with inflation and buying food becomes a major challenge. Alcohol and drugs translates as a means of escaping from the suffering imposed by the condition. Those working on the front lines, teachers, welfare workers, etc, know too well the pressures brought about from poverty. In this interesting study, Dr. Payne has gathered important information about the poor, middle classes and the wealthy. Each of these socio/economic sectors have specific rules that are for the most part tacit, hidden, and those out side a specific class are unaware of these rules. Dr. Payne has identified the rules for each class, particularly the poor, which has aided many teachers across the world to understand the hidden rules of the generational poor, in order then, to develop strategies for children to learn and improve conditions for themselves and their families.<br /><br />A young teacher fresh out of college working their first teaching job in a poor inner city public school will feel like a stranger in a strange land because his/her expectations will never be met. More than likely the new teacher will have come from a middle class background where one's values and general outlook on life is much different. Why does the boy in Year 8, for example, own an expensive cell phone but then complains that he doesn't have enough money for school books, pencils and paper. Why isn't education valued above entertainment? Why do most people who are in poverty have a fatalistic view, believing they are destined to remain in their current condition? Those in generational poverty have different rules and it is necessary for the teacher in an educational setting, to understand these rules, the reasons for certain behaviours, to then develop workable strategies in order for effective teaching and learning to occur.<br /><br />I came across this book at a seminar for educators to better understand students and children who come from generational poor backgrounds. Teaching these children is a major and important challenge because the poor seem to be growing in number and middle class values, expectations and traditional teaching strategies are not working anymore. Dr. Payne has identified key patterns of behaviour in the generational poor along with practical strategies to effectively teach these children to overcome their situations and live more fulfilling and richer lives.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book and a significant contribution to education.r current condition?

This collection of Wittgenstein's \\"remarks\\" written over a time period of forty years was first published as \\"Vermischte Bemerkungen\\" in the original German in 1977. These remarks are taken from his private manuscripts and diaries, which were finally translated into English in 1980.<br /><br />As a vast majority of Wittgenstein's manuscripts or notebooks were written with no intent by the author for publication, it makes one wonder how the philosopher would feel about this book. He comments on a vast array of subjects from architecture, Shakespeare and music. And, of course, his philosophical musings, some remarks actually taken from his famous text, Philosophical Investigations.<br /><br />It would be helpful if the reader had some previous knowledge of Wittgenstein's work and life before embarking on this text, however, I don't believe it to be absolutely essential. Surprisingly, numerous remarks throughout the text can stand alone on their own merit without contextualization. On the other hand, these remarks can also contribute to a greater understanding of Wittgenstein's philosophy, thus, in the end, Culture and Value is an excellent addition to the Wittgenstein Corpus.<br /><br />I've come to understand that reading Wittgenstein is about a process of thought, a new method of thinking about our language and the world. Wittgenstein is not about a theory of reality but a process of thinking, asking different questions, never taking anything for granted, always pushing against conventional wisdom, pushing thought to its limits. At times these \\"aphorisms\\" can communicate as nonsense, ephemeral, disconnected, etc, but reading them slowly, immersing oneself into them, can produce some interesting results.<br /><br />One of my favourite aphorisms: \\"Nothing is so difficult as not deceiving oneself.\\"<br /><br />Or one of his descriptions of genius: \\"There is no more light in a genius than in any other honest man - but he has a particular kind of lens to concentrate this light into a burning point.\\"<br /><br />Reading Wittgenstein's remarks gives us a point of entry into his essential concerns as a philosopher and a human being. In fact the last remarks were written in 1951, the year of his death.<br /><br />Culture and Value is that type of philosophical text that can be picked up occasionally over many years and one will continue to find stimulus for thought.ncentrate this light into a burning point.\\" <br /> <br />Reading Wittgenstein's remarks gives us a point of entry into his essential concerns as a philosopher and a human being.

Wittgenstein the man, and Wittgenstein's philosophy has been the focus of modern thinker's for two generations. His enigmatic logic and original thoughts on the nature of language, for example, has influenced many disciplines across the spectrum, including anthropology, cultural studies and literary theory. Wittgenstein has also been called the quintessential icon of Modernism, the most original thinker since Plato, yet has been the most misunderstood philosopher in the history of ideas. If you want to understand his philosophy, where do you start? This study guide, written clearly by John Heaton, in my opinion, is a good place to begin.<br /><br />Introducing Wittgenstein combines biographical information about the man and his thoughts. The only book to be published by Wittgenstein in his lifetime was his Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus, a mere seventy-page treatise that confounded and inspired the leading minds of his generation. The book begins with the line, \\"The world is all that is the case.\\" ending with the line, \\"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.\\" As Heaton proposes, \\"...the last sentence assumes that only factual propositions are meaningful, so the world consists only in facts...there is a distinction between what can be -said- and what can only be -shown- is being developed organically\\" (P. 30)<br /><br />The Tractatus was not intended to be an easy study. In fact in the Preface, Wittgenstein wrote, \\"Its purpose would be achieved if it gave pleasure to one person who read and understood it.\\"<br /><br />Introducing Wittgenstein moves on from the Tractatus touching on the changes of the man's thought about the nature of language, logic, mathematics, religion, art and culture, up to the end of his life.<br /><br />Heaton makes a brave and successful attempt to illustrate the many at times complex ideas in Wittgenstein's later work, Philosophical Investigations, which most academics today believe is the more developed and refined expressions of his philosophy.<br /><br />This book does a fine job of explaining Wittgenstein's thought in a clear and accessible manner and tone; although superficial, touching only the surfaces, as it is an introduction, it is an appropriate place to begin.d expressions of his philosophy. <br /> <br />This book does a fine job of explaining Wittgenstein's thought in a clear and accessible manner and tone; although superficial, touching only the surfaces, as it is an introduction, it is an appropriate place to begin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-20

Having read four instalments of Preston and Child's Special Agent Pendergast series, including the latest, Dance of Death, although a ripping yarn, Still Life with Crows manages to shine brighter in terms of plot, characters and the overall pace of the story.<br /><br />A serial killer is loose in the sleepy town of Medicine Creek, Kansas, murdering his victims in extremely imaginative ways, putting the town on high alert, and its looking like the perpetrator is a local. True to form, Pendergast mysteriously arrives on the scene, claiming to be on vacation, and offers his services. The murders continue, confounding the highly intelligent and erudite detective, becoming more and more gruesome.<br /><br />If you haven't been introduced to Aloysius Pendergast, then you're in for a treat, as he is the most original detective to emerge in popular fiction since Sherlock Holmes. The man only dresses in finely tailored, top of the line black suits, handmade Oxford shoes and drives a Rolls Royce. He's an intellectual with highly tuned powers of observation, speaks several languages, including Mandarin, only drinks expensive green tea, and appears to have the strength of three men. But his true gift is his mastery of the ancient Chinese discipline of Chongg Ran. The author's describe it as, \\"...a form of concentration that marries utter emptiness with hyper-awareness, the fusion of rigorous intellectual study and pure sensation.\\" It brings unheard of mental powers, transporting the subject outside of space and time. \\"Sight without seeing.\\" Pendergast uses this ability when the physical clues to a case dry up, revealing aspects about the case that otherwise would be missed. Preston and Child describe the process so well that the reader feels to be transported along with Pendergast to these other states of awareness. This is an original concept for a popular detective used to great effect.<br /><br />Still Life with Crows has all the hallmarks of a well-crafted thriller, well-written, well paced with well-drawn-out characters and just enough description to set the stage, combined with imaginative twists and turns, with Pendergast's colourful and unorthodox approach to the investigation, making this without question a five star novel.<br /><br /> In my humble opinion, I believe this novel is one of the best, if not the best, in the series., well-written, well paced with well-drawn-out characters and just enough description to set the stage, combined with imaginative twists and turns, with Pendergast's colourful and unorthodox approach to the investigation, making this without question a five star novel.  <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, I believe this novel is one of the best, if not the best, in the series.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-11

Bob Woodward's book is also an inspiring story of investigative journalism intent on discovering the truth and exposing that truth during a tumultuous period in American history. This text is also about constitutional rights, and the necessary right of a journalist to protect their sources, which arguably is a fine ethical line that requires further debate. However Woodward protected the identity of Deep Throat for over thirty years, setting a professional precedent for him personally, gaining the trust of sources in Washington's political arena, that otherwise would have remained silent. For the most part, though, Woodward explores the multifaceted relationship with W. Mark Felt, (Deep Throat) the former number two man in the FBI. What was Felt's motivation to lead Woodward and Bernstein in the direction of criminal activities in the highest echelons of government, eventually leading to the disgraced downfall of a president? What did Felt have to gain? Woodward attempts in this highly readable text to examine these motivations and his own conscience in regards to exposing Deep Throat to the world.<br /><br />Despite the passing of a third of a century, the Watergate scandal continues to remain fresh in the minds for many people across the world. Why? Watergate was a striking example for the common citizen that even those in the highest realms of power cannot escape the hands of justice. It also showed how a free democracy with a free press could question authority, exposing the abuses of power, seeking the truth, and justice being served.<br /><br />The resignation of president Nixon in 1974 was instigated, the final death blow, the so-called smoking gun, by the infamous Nixon tapes, when Nixon ordered the CIA to ask the FBI to stop their investigation on false national security grounds. This blew the lid sky high, and the message was clear: the tapes recorded Nixon ordering the cover-up revealing the president and his cronies were lying and their attempt to bury the scandal.<br /><br />Woodward paints an interesting picture of Deep Throat: a solid FBI man who had a great admiration for J. Edgar Hoover, and was passed over for the number one spot at the agency not once but twice. After Hoover died, Nixon, politicising the agency, appointed Patrick Gray number one, and Felt was left doing all the work with none of the perks.  Later in the text, it becomes clear that Felt was not acting on a personal vendetta, but saw his beloved FBI being tainted with political skulduggery, and wanted to do something about it. I believe this was his initial motivation for developing his relationship with Woodward as Deep Throat.<br /><br />This is an entertaining read as Woodward has that ability as a writer to combine journalism with a novelist's flair.

Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper are arguably the most well known 20th century philosophers outside the walls of academia. Their views on philosophy, however, could not be more disparate. When Wittgenstein published the Tractatus, a mere 70 page philosophical treatise, which The Times London called a \\"logical poem\\", it put the subject of philosophy on its head. Wittgenstein rejected metaphysical propositions, claiming that to be meaningful, propositions have to mirror possible state of affairs. It is in the Tractatus that he revealed his picture theory of language, in which \\"language in its structure represents the world.\\" (P.132) There are no problems in philosophy, Wittgenstein claimed, only puzzles to be deciphered.<br /><br />Karl Popper believed Wittgenstein to be terribly mistaken. He claimed that there are serious problems in philosophy to be solved, and laid down his philosophy of science, presenting his verification and falsification theory in his magnum opus, The Logic of Scientific Discovery. The backgrounds of these two men are strikingly similar, raised in pre WWI Vienna though from opposite social stations, and only to cross paths much later in life at the famous meeting of the Moral Science Club at Cambridge, in which a ten-minute exchange occurred between the two irascible and profound thinkers, that went down in academic history.<br /><br />This is philosophic journalism at its most readable form, combining history, biography, philosophy, careful speculation and first-hand witness accounts. The authors describe Viennese culture and its intellectual and artistic movements just prior to the fall of the Austrian Hungarian empire that, in effect, truly defined modernism. Vienna during this time produced Wittgenstein, Freud, Popper, Robert Musil, Victor Adler, Gustav Klimt and Mahler. This was fin-de-siecle Vienna that some would suggest changed the way we view the world and ourselves. Although a short book, Edmonds and Eidinow have captured the atmosphere and the personalities that contributed to the profound thoughts and ideas that shaped Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper.<br /><br />This is philosophy as drama, philosophy as comedy, and ultimately an entertaining ride through the history of ideas, using as its starting point, a simple ten-minute confrontation between two men, that has managed to remain in the minds of many influential individuals and great thinkers in their own right throughout the twentieth century.<br /><br />Even if you have no interest in logical positivism, analytical philosophy or philosophy as a whole, but are interested in the history of ideas, this well written and amusing book would be well worth a look at.ersonalities that contributed to the profound thoughts and ideas that shaped Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper.

Ambassador Wilson's The Politics of Truth is a lucid account of his long and distinguished career in the American Foreign Service, and a detailed and at times shocking description of the infamous so-called Niger-Iraq Uranium Deal that mysteriously was included in President Bush's State of the Union Address. Wilson also tells the story of his wife's betrayal by the Bush administration, revealing her identity as a covert CIA Operative, knowing full well that this revelation would put her and other operatives in harms way. This is an appalling story of an administration that will stoop to anything, including treason, in an effort to cover their web of deception to the Senate, the U.S. Congress and the American people.<br /><br />Ambassador Wilson's career in the U.S. Foreign Service makes compelling reading. His diplomatic postings included Niger, Togo, South Africa, Burundi, the Congo, Iraq and finally Washington as an advisor for African affairs to President Clinton. One has a stereotypical image of ambassadors, wearing expensive suits, attending cocktail parties in lush palaces discussing the fate of entire nations. To a small extent this romantic image may be true, but the vast majority of Foreign Service is hard work, balancing the diplomatic line.<br /><br />Wilson worked for the first Bush administration during Desert Storm, heroically negotiating the release of American prisoners in Iraq. Wilson has great admiration for George H. W. Bush and has nothing but praise for his handling of Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf War. In fact Wilson was the last American representative that spoke with Saddam before the American invasion of Kuwait. Wilson's career in the Foreign Service is an example of loyal service to one's country, which makes the subsequent events in his life under the current Bush administration that much more diabolical.<br /><br />The Bush administration alleged that Iraq was in the midst of developing nuclear weapons based on spurious intelligence reports, which justified to congress and the American people the invasion and occupation of Iraq. On CIA request, Wilson was asked to visit Niger and investigate the alleged sale of \\"yellow cake\\" to Iraq. His investigation proved no such exchange occurred, and reported this information back to the CIA. Despite this intelligence, the Bush administration forged ahead, using this false information to persuade the international community and the American people to go to war. Ambassador Wilson was outraged that the Bush administration would out-right lie to justify war, and wrote an OP-ED piece in the New York Times exposing the falsehood. It was now on for young and old.<br /><br />Suddenly the neocons and the right wing press launched a smear campaign on Ambassador Wilson's character, and when that wasn't working, someone high up in the Bush administration leaked the identity of Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, as a CIA covert operative, risking her life and the lives of many others. This action cannot be categorized as simply \\"the game of Washington politics\\" as certain individuals in the administration has attempted to propose as a tool of mitigation. The stark reality is that the U.S. is at war, and during wartime, to expose covert operatives is an act of treason, punishable by death. What is mind-boggling is that the investigation into this act of treason has been dragging for several months without a resolution in sight. Those in the Bush administration that leaked Plame's identity should be brought to justice in a timely manner, especially during wartime. But as usual, the Bush neocons continue to finger point, duck and weave, and shrug-off the situation as if it was below them. Ten years ago, President Clinton was impeached for twisting the truth about a sexual impropriety, and here we have an administration out-right lying to congress, sending American men and women to their deaths, spending billions of dollars on war reparations that could have been avoided, andcommitting treason during wartime. Does this administration have so much power that the wheels of justice cannot touch them? Are people too scared to stand up to these men?<br /><br />Politics of Truth is a remarkable text, revealing corruption in the highest echelons of government. Finally we have an individual with enough guts and sense of civic duty to hold a position against the machinations of a dishonest administration.voided, and committing treason during wartime.

Diogenes Pedergast is the 21st century master criminal, similar in many respects to Sherlock Holmes' arch rival and one-time nemesis, Professor Moriarity. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created the ultimate 19th century criminal; Moriarity was ruthless, cunning and much too brilliant for the world's most famous detective. Many readers have commented that Aloysius Pedergast, the protagonist in Still Life of Crows, The Cabinet of Curiosities, Brimstone and Dance of Death is similar in many ways to Sherlock Holmes - they are sophisticated, extremely intelligent, and uniquely unorthodox possessing keen powers of observation and deduction.<br /><br />In this superb novel, these two clever brothers cross swords, as the evil Diogenes begins murdering Aloysius's closest friends in very creative ways. Diogenes has a deep psychological hostility towards his brother, and will go to any lengths to hurt him. He is out to commit the perfect crime, and the game is afoot from start to finish. These two superior minds clash making this an excellent sequel as well as a brilliant thriller in its own right.<br /><br />There is something about these novels' that is creatively unique and miles apart from other popular fiction. On the one hand they mix genres - thriller, crime, gothic, science fiction - yet they have the distinct air of the 19th century melodrama with the evil villain, hero and the damsel in distress. The dastardly villain ties the pretty girl to the railroad tracks, only to be saved in the knick of time by the handsome hero. The Pedergast series of novels are similar to the old silent films, where the audience views one episode every Saturday afternoon, heckling the screen when the villain appears, and applauding the hero when he saves the day. This may sound incredibly lame to some people, but Preston and Child have tapped into a winning formula, as the Pendergast novels are extremely popular and entertaining. This formula works, as it is easy to suspend disbelief and run with the tale.<br /><br />Dance of Death is a perfect sequel to Brimstone.

US	45814424	R3OC9LRUT1H567	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	3	4	7	N	N	Finding Dracula	This story is at times entertaining, laboriously overwritten, presenting a balanced blend of realism and fantasy, on a well-trodden subject, (Dracula) which in the end, managed to relatively succeed for a first time novel.<br /><br />The idea is brilliant, approaching the Count Dracula legend as historical fact, presenting the story from several perspectives, laden with historical information concerning medieval Europe, the fall of Constantinople, and Vlad the Impaler's severe though courages effort to prevent the Muslim onslaught in the 16th century.<br /><br />Vlad was a warrior who enjoyed his work, ruthlessly torturing and killing his enemies in creative ways, instilling fear throughout the Ottoman Empire. Dracula's reputation preceded him and he used this reputation, like Genghis Khan, to great effect. In the novel, Kostovo provides us with all the historical details, as the various narrators' travel through Istanbul, Budapest and Eastern Europe in search of the alleged vampire's tomb.<br /><br />The first hundred pages of this six hundred page text pulls the reader in fiercely, but then takes flight on various subjects that a good editor would have red-lined to ensure its rising pace was maintained. The problem is the writing launches beautifully, then runs out of steam for three hundred pages, and miraculously launches again in the last quarter of the novel. I found the vast majority of the writing taxing and ultimately unnecessary that in the hands of a professional editor might have been saved.<br /><br />Having said that, the investigative journey in discovering Dracula's whereabouts through deciphering obscure and esoteric signs and thousand year old manuscripts, strange codes and early monastic lore was very entertaining. Kostovo's descriptions of the numerous magnificent libraries, shows she is a bibliophile herself, and feels at home in the scholarly atmosphere of old books and dusty study rooms.<br /><br />If you enjoy medieval history, a well-constructed mystery investigation with esoteric subject matter, including vampires, you'll more than likely take pleasure in this debut novel. My advice would be to hang in there till the last hundred pages because it does get better and eventually ends well.ric subject matter, including vampires, you'll more than likely take pleasure in this debut novel.

Gabriel Allon is one of the best art restorers in the world, and also an assassin for the Israeli Intelligence Service. A Nazi war criminal investigator is bombed in his office in Vienna, and Gabriel is called on to investigate the crime, leading him on a trek across Europe and Israel.<br /><br />What is interesting is how Silva brings the reader along, uncovering the mysteries one step at a time, pulling us into the tale. The characters are finely drawn and his prose direct and tightly descriptive, painting a vivid story of death and deception. There is a distinct air of realism in this writing as nothing is exaggerated, giving the story a believable edge.<br /><br />Silva's descriptions of Israel, for example, are done so well that I could actually visualize Jerusalem, the burning sunsets, pollution and exotic scents. His descriptions of Rome and the Vatican are also right on the mark as Allon pursues the identity of an alleged Nazi, possibly helped by the Catholic Church to escape justice.<br /><br />Before reading this novel, I had no idea of how many Nazi war criminals are out there living under aliases in South America, Europe and the United States. It would certainly be a full time job to track these men down, expose their true identities and put them on trial. Unfortunately, the more time passes, the less chance there is to find them and bring them to justice. And I believe they should be tried for their terrible crimes against humanity.<br /><br />This is a masterful thriller in the hands of a writer who knows his art form. Gabriel Allon is an interesting character and I look forward to reading his other books, namely The Confessor, The English Assassin and his latest, Prince of Fire.<br /><br />A Death in Vienna is simply a brilliant book.	2005-07-01

In one of his most popular texts, A Secret Country, (1989) he revealed the history of the systematic genocide of Australia's indigenous people. Aboriginal \\"deaths in custody\\" had reached epidemic proportions, (Aboriginal \\"suicides\\" in prison) and this widely read book pushed those in government to investigate and form laws to prevent further deaths. Pilger also pointed out Australia's two-sided nature, that is, its multicultural diverse and tolerant people, but also its entrenched unspoken racism. He is an investigative journalist who is concerned about revealing the truth, which seems to be a rare attribute in our highly influenced mainstream media these days. In The New Rulers of the World, Pilger reveals American and British imperialism through economic and military actions in the guise of the \\"war on terror\\".<br /><br />The American enterprise of world domination did not start with the current Bush administration, however, they are the current promoters and executers. Pilger discusses the invasions of Panama, Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and the killing of thousands of civilians either by bombing, starvation or disease, due to the sanctions imposed by the government under the flag of the United Nations, and the mainstream media conveniently failing to report these massive deaths. The theme of this book, in Pilger's own words, is to \\"...compare the actions of politicians in western democracies with those of criminal tyrants.\\" He writes that the central difference between the two is the \\"distance from the carnage\\", and the propaganda imposed to make it not a crime if \\"we\\" commit it. He goes on to write:<br /><br />\\"It is not a crime to murder more than half a million peasants with bombs dropped secretly and illegally on Cambodia, igniting an Asian holocaust. It is not a crime for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Tony Blair and his Tory predecessors to have caused the deaths in Iraq of `more people than have been killed by all weapons of mass destruction in history', to quote the conclusion of the American study.\\" (P.8)<br /><br />Pilger points out our glaring \\"double standard\\" where the deaths of the \\"unpeople\\", that is innocent citizens in other countries, is somehow not a crime but most certainly is when our own people die. As a result of the sanctions on Iraq in the 90's, for example, up to 6000 children per month died as a result of the blockade. This was the obstruction of $4 billion of humanitarian supplies by the US and British governments, not the actions of Saddam Hussein.<br /><br />These wars, specifically Afghanistan and Iraq, are about dominance over the richest regions in the world, controlling its gas and oil reserves. Studies have shown that without these reserves, western nations will be without oil in ten years, plummeting the American economy into a third world country. The American government would never permit this to happen, thus the \\"war on terror\\", occupying sovereign states, and the loss of so many innocent lives.<br /><br />The text covers a lot of ground and exposes the intention of governments in their strategy to dominate the world stage economically and by force. Interestingly, the geopolitical and military strategic importance of Iraq and Afghanistan, in terms of natural resources, (Caspian sea) is paramount in the control of the entire Middle East.<br /><br />According to neoconservatives and the present Bush administration, the blueprint for the new imperialism is already mapped out and well under way. Pilger cites Zbigniew Brzezinski, advisor to several presidents, and his book, The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives, as the bible for the present Bush administration.<br /><br />In the last chapter of this book, Pilger reveals the hypocrisy of the Australian government and their treatment and utter \\"denial\\" of the plight of the Aboriginal people. While other countries like Canada and the US have reconciled with their own indigenous peoples, land grants, etc, the Howard government refuses to even make a formal apology, as did the Canadian and American governments to the Indians. This is to point out the enduring legacy of imperialism left over from the 19th century in our treatment of the indigenous people.<br /><br />This is an illuminating book and one all people should read in order to gain a greater understanding of the intentions behind the war and unending deaths around us.l people.

As the tale unfolds, it becomes an intense psychological thriller about obsessive love, after a professional couple witness a terrible accident in the English countryside of a man falling to his gruesome death from a hot air balloon. For anyone, witnessing a senseless death can have dire emotional consequences. Ian McEwan is an expert at creating emotional suspense as we experience the thoughts and actions of his characters. One feels the paranoia and sheer anger of Joe Rose as a strange man, J. Parry, stalks him relentlessly, writing endless letters, standing outside his apartment and following him through the streets of London. The problem is that no one, including his wife and the police, believes the situation to be serious, until the man's obsession turns dangerously psychotic.<br /><br />McEwan describes homo-erotic obsession with religious overtones in such realistic detail that it is simply chilling to follow Joe Roses reactions to the obsessive actions of his stalker. Pure erotomania is a strange disease as the subject is under the delusional belief that the `object' of their obsession is in love with them. Their mind will conveniently cast aside any facts to the contrary of their self created delusion, even to the extent of denying the fact that the `object' is married. One of the most frightening aspects about this particular mental disease is that it can continue on for years, not entirely ending until the patient's death.<br /><br />The stalker does not let up and Joe Rose's life spins out of control. His beautiful wife simply does not see the seriousness of the situation and believes the real problem to be with Joe. There is a brilliant chapter in the novel where the narrative switches from the first person to the third, giving the reader access to his wife's point of view during an intense argument. We gain sympathy for the wife but realize she is not listening, and not understanding what Joe is saying because she is so caught up in her life. And like most relationships or marriages, it is difficult to be totally selfless. However, even at the end, she continues not to see her husband's point of view, despite the harrowing events that take place.<br /><br />This book is about love in its many forms, from the `normal' to the psychotic. McEwan displays great insight into the human psyche and the numerous contradictions it contains. Enduring Love is an exciting narrative and truly haunting in its depiction of human obsession.or the wife but realize she is not listening, and not understanding what Joe is saying because she is so caught up in her life.

Sonchai is certainly a bizarre character, a part time pimp for his ex prostitute mother, working their highly successful brothel in the seamy red light district of Bangkok, \\"The Old Man's Club\\", and partners in the business with his boss, Colonel Vikorn, the cunning Thai gangster and head of the city's police force. It's business as usual until one of their top working girls, Chayna, comes stumbling back into the club drenched in blood, to discover her \\"john\\" back at the hotel room, castrated and skinned. When questioned, the poor girl is stoned on opium, forcing Vikorn and Sonchai to write the confession for her, and quickly get her out of town, because the victim, unfortunately, is CIA.<br /><br />Bangkok Tattoo is a very entertaining read because the cast of characters, prostitutes, pimps, transvestites, drug dealers, Japanese gangsters, Chinese diplomats, are all written extremely well and highly unusual, making the story out of the ordinary, down right strange at times, and enormously interesting.<br /><br />Sonchai Jitpleecheep does not care much for \\"farang\\", using this word countless times throughout the narrative. (A bit too much) In a word, he believes all westerner's are schizophrenic, media drenched, materialistic, lacking any spirituality, puritanical and hypocritical, and exceedingly stupid. The CIA characters are bumbling and for the most part, lost; and the Old Man's Club clientele are middle-aged sex deprived ex hippies that require Viagra to have a good time. There's not one \\"farang\\" in the entire book with any redeeming qualities whatsoever, but I guess that's part of the novel's charm.<br /><br />I found this novel to be much better than Burdett's last effort. He was finding himself in Bangkok 8, and has settled into the characters with Bangkok Tattoo. He's much more comfortable with his style and it definitely shows in the writing.<br /><br />If you like the crime/thriller genre from a slightly bent perspective, from eastern Thai Buddhist eyes, you'll like this book.

Political cronyism has been part and parcel of western democracy since the hay days of the Roman Empire. It is extremely naïve to believe otherwise, \\"jobs for the boys\\"; political portfolios for the \\"mates\\", and lucrative contracts for family members are an unfortunate aspect of the system, which has not changed, and will not change, in the foreseeable future. Moreover, another unfortunate reality is that war is good business. One only has to look back at the Civil War, those \\"damn Yankee carpet baggers\\", filtering down from the north at the end of the war and exploiting the defeated Southerners, in the name of \\"reparations\\". Many made a fortune from the defeated south, just as a few companies are currently making millions from the spoils of the Iraqi war. What Briody calls in this book, the \\"iron triangle\\", the collusion of government, military and corporations, he targets the Halliburton Corporation and its subsidiary, Kellogg, Brown & Root, describing a long history of political back scratching, war profiteering, illegal campaign contributions, and a long and lucrative relationship with key political figures, such as Lyndon B. Johnson and currently, Vice President Cheney, which is making a few individuals extremely rich, unjustly, from the hard earned tax dollars of the American people.<br /><br />Most of the book is devoted to illustrating the business history of Halliburton and Brown & Root, providing a long and entrenched business practice of political back scratching through illegal campaign contributions, in this case, the long and successful relationship between Lyndon B. Johnson and the Brown brothers through the 40's 50's, 60's, turning Brown & Root into one of the most successful construction companies in American history. The evidence of this collusion between the company and Johnson is without question. But the current relationship between Halliburton and Vice President Cheney, once CEO of this lucrative corporation, to my mind, is even more ethically devastating, as their relationship continues today, while the company has sole contractual rights with the government, supporting the military and \\"rebuilding\\" the war torn country of Iraq.<br /><br />Why has Halliburton been given these lucrative contracts while other companies are pushed out of the bidding process? One can say that they have a proven track record of getting the job done, but there is also evidence of over charging (gas supplies to Iraq) that is currently under investigation. It is also well know that Halliburton has done business with known terrorist countries such as Libya, and manage to wriggle out of the legal spotlight. One would have to be a blind man not to see the connection between the Bush administration and these companies, no matter how many times Cheney denies the relationship exists in present time. As an ex CEO, he continues to be on their payroll and is in possession of numerous stock options. These facts should certainly raise a few red flags.<br /><br />This book illustrates the political and corporate machinations that go on behind the scenes, and that \\"jobs for the boys\\" is an unfortunate reality of our system, and war, regrettably, is a profitable business option.<br /><br />Recommended.y devastating, as their relationship continues today, while the company has sole contractual rights with the government, supporting the military and \\"rebuilding\\" the war torn country of Iraq.  <br /> <br />Why has Halliburton been given these lucrative contracts while other companies are pushed out of the bidding process?

Pendergast has a deep air of mystery, a man with many dark secrets. In this novel, some of these dark secrets are revealed, which have an unsavoury connection to the case.<br /><br />The bones of century old murder victims are found on a construction site, where Pendergast miraculously appears to investigate. He gains the help of Dr. Nora Kelly, an archaeologist working for the New York Museum of Natural History, where an investigation ensues leading to the discovery of a 19th century serial killer, and later, a copy cat killer arrives on the scene, performing the same gruesome acts on his victims, surgically removing their lower spines.<br /><br />There is something distinctly melodramatic about this tale. But because it is so entertaining, moving at such a fast pace, it is very easy to suspend disbelief and be carried away with the characters and the investigation. To a certain extent, Pendergast could not really exist in the real world, racing around in his chaffer driven Rolls Royce, his Andy Warhol looks and his aristocratic manner, solving modern crimes in a similar fashion to a modern day Sherlock Holmes. However, as a character, we want him to exist, because he is so different from you run-of-the-mill police investigator. Pendergast is different, smart, sophisticated and we want him to succeed.<br /><br />The Cabinet of Curiosities is a amusing read with some good characters and an unbelievable plot that you really want to believe in because it is so fun. This an enjoyable novel, and I look forward to another Lincoln Child instalment.	2005-06-12

This made the country an easy target for unusual favours, such as military bases, U.N. votes, oil and natural resources. Perkins was known secretly in this trade as an EHM, economic hit man, inflating economic forecasts on huge construction and engineering projects, with the single intent of bankrupting the particular country. The man was trained specifically for this task, evidently battling with his conscience for over thirty years until a few major world events, such as 9/11, caused him to break away completely.<br /><br />This book certainly reads like a good Robert Ludlum novel. Perkins' first training came from a smart and attractive woman known as \\"Claudine\\", meeting secretly at her apartment, and learning the strategies of an EHM, skilfully inflating economic forecasts on projects to foreign government officials, ensuring billion dollar investments, knowing full well that the country would be in debt in a matter of a few years. \\"Claudine\\" goes on to say:<br /><br />\\"We're paid - well paid - to cheat countries around the globe out of billions of dollars. A large part of your job is to encourage world leaders to become part of a vast network that promotes commercial interests...we can draw on them whenever we desire - to satisfy our political, economic, or military needs.\\" (P.17)<br /><br />Perkins cites many examples throughout the text, including the Saudi Arabian Money Laundering Affair, connecting the United States to a country that give terrorists asylum, yet will continue to keep the money and oil flowing, making the wealthy richer and our gas tanks full. Even more disturbing are the examples of Argentina, the illegal invasion of Panama, and lastly, the invasion of Iraq, where now the Halliburton Corporation (Vice President Cheney once was CEO) has the contract to \\"rebuild\\" this war torn country.<br /><br />This is an honest account from a man whom was threatened and bribed not to write this book, but could not stand his raging conscience after recent terrible world events that could lead to further crisis. My gut impression, after turning the last page, is that Perkins is not out to become famous, make more money or seek political office, but a man whose conscience required him to tell this story. This book is both enlightening and terribly disturbing, but a necessary read for all those concerned about the world situation, and where it is possibly leading.own as \\"Claudine\\", meeting secretly at her apartment, and learning the strategies of an EHM, skilfully inflating economic forecasts on projects to foreign government officials, ensuring billion dollar investments, knowing full well that the country would be in debt in a matter of a few years. \\"Claudine\\" goes on to say: <br /> <br />\\"We're paid - well paid - to cheat countries around the globe out of billions of dollars.

US	45814424	RS6IONB3WZDL9	081221725X	62811011	The Scapegoat	Books	5	80	80	N	N	Psychological realism at its best	The theme of the living double or strange twin is not uncommon in literature. In Fyodor Dostoyevsky's, The Double, (1846) Mr. Golyadkin believes he sees himself on a train, haunted by this manifestation, he becomes obsessed with meeting himself, chasing this figure endlessly through the streets of St Petersburg. Many have commented that this nightmarish story is ultimately about the fear of confronting one's darker nature, the terrible \\"other\\", and if viewed in totality, could well lead to death.<br /><br />In The Scapegoat, du Maurier explores a similar theme, where the protagonist, John, a very English and staid history lecturer of French culture, one evening meets his exact double in the train station at Le Mans. John is bored, searching for some connection to life, a meaning to his empty existence. Jean de Gue, however, has a full life, a member of an aristocratic family, a wife, child and a century's old business and the many problems that come with so many connections and responsibilities. He's not happy with this life and wants only to escape. Both men have dinner, drink too much, and John wakes up the next morning to find his cloths and belongings vanished, and Gaston, the driver and head servant, ready to drive him (John) back to the Chateau, St Giles. John decides to play the role of Jean de Gue's scapegoat, though in a few days, finds himself inextricably involved, emotionally and otherwise, in de Gue's affairs and family.<br /><br />Du Maurier is an excellent writer. John's journey into the world of his double is strangely intriguing, as he narrates his deceptions and observations, and how easily he falls into the role. No one in the family suspects his masquerade, though he comes very close to revealing himself many times. The repressed emotions and history of du Gue's family runs deep and hold numerous dark secrets. I found myself rushing through the tale to discover these secrets and what John will do next. The plot sounds outlandish on the surface, but this is psychological realism at its best, causing this reader at least, to become obsessed with how the story finally resolves itself - and it is not disappointing.<br /><br />These characters certainly come from another time and another place. Jean de Gue's daughter, Marie-Noel, is a deeply religious child who experiences visions and loves her father beyond words. My thought was that if any of the family would see through John's deceptions, it would be the child. This young child, through her innocence, is the only voice of truth in the house, and her antics and precocious dialogue speaks of another time - a truly unique and memorable character.<br /><br />This is a masterful piece of literature, a unique thriller that will be just as fascinating and entertaining for readers a hundred years from now.ut this is psychological realism at its best, causing this reader at least, to become obsessed with how the story finally resolves itself - and it is not disappointing.<br /><br />These characters certainly come from another time and another place.

However a new police chief is on board with a mission to clean house. Harry's old enemy, Deputy Chief Irving, a self-serving political player, wants Harry to fail and will do anything to achieve this end. Bosch has been assigned to the Open-Unsolved Unit, (cold cases) teamed up with his old partner, Kiz Rider, a no nonsense police woman in a predominately male domain, embark on an unsolved seventeen year old murder of a young girl, shot through the chest and taken out of her bedroom and dumped in a field. Harry attacks this unsolved murder with calculated zeal, leading to possible corruption in the force, pushing the case to it limits to find the perpetrator. The Closers begins at breakneck speed and doesn't let up until the last page is turned.<br /><br />Reading The Closers was like meeting an old friend after a year of absence. Harry Bosch is one of the great characters in crime fiction, a man with an incredible sense of justice and an over bearing conscience, that pulls him into trouble from time to time. His relationship with Kiz Rider, as his partner, is a perfect match, as they know each other well, can read each other's thoughts before a word is spoken. Kiz never rides on Harry's coattails, but contributes to the motion, adding her own special skills to the investigation. Harry is older but he's a little smarter, and careful to stay within the bounds of the law. Kiz keeps Harry in line and is there to prevent him from slipping into his old, unorthodox habits.<br /><br />As a piece of crime fiction, The Closers is by no means a character study, it is entirely plot driven, following Harry Bosch at work to every twist and turn of the case. Connelly knows how to write a crime novel and does not leave anything to the imagination. I have come to believe that the crime genre is an art form all its own, and Connelly has become one of its masters.<br /><br />This is the real thing. Modern detective fiction doesn't get any better, and in the hands of Connelly, one can be sure the ride will be thoroughly entertaining; and The Closers delivers on all counts - a five star effort.gination.

I remember as a first year university student, sitting down in my first philosophy class, expecting to learn the secrets of the ages, and the young professor flippantly entering the classroom, only to hand us a list of technical terms, and giving us our first assignment: \\"Learn these terms. Come back in a week and expect to be tested. If you receive anything less than 100%, I would sincerely advise dropping this class and taking up psychology or something.\\" He then left the lecture hall. Needless to say, I worked the entire week learning or more so, memorizing these terms, such as, Idea in the Platonic sense; Socratic Method; dialectic, reminiscence, anamnesis, justice, truth and aesthetics. A week passed and the test consisted of the word and enough blank space to write the answer. Only eighty percent of us passed the test (an extraordinary outcome) and over half ended up dropping the course. Looking back at the blood sweat and tears of this first year class, I only wished I had owned this valuable reference then - it would have made life a lot easier. However I had learned a valuable lesson: no matter what the subject may be, before embarking on the particular ideas and basic tenets, learn the foundational terms, and the journey will be a lot less difficult.<br /><br />A Dictionary of Philosophy will make the journey of learning philosophy or the history of ideas much easier. It includes the classic thinkers, Plato, Aquinas, Descartes Spinoza, Kant, through to James, Pierce, Russell, and Wittgenstein. The definitions are clear and straightforward, encompassing thousands of years of western thought.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this dictionary is heavily cross-referenced. This will be a great chore for some individuals; however, the editors have used an asterisk... \\"Preceding a text word or name to indicate that the word or name itself constitutes a separate entry, where additional relevant information will be found, which indicate a separate entry.\\" In a dictionary that defines terms in so many disciplines, including the more recent encroachment of the \\"social sciences\\", cross-referencing is unavoidable. But this is part of the process in learning philosophy as one school of thought invariably moves into another and so forth.<br /><br />For the student this text is highly recommended.l be a great chore for some individuals; however, the editors have used an asterisk... \\"Preceding a text word or name to indicate that the word or name itself constitutes a separate entry, where additional relevant information will be found, which indicate a separate entry.\\" In a dictionary that defines terms in so many disciplines, including the more recent encroachment of the \\"social sciences\\", cross-referencing is unavoidable.

US	45814424	R3LMA766O6AK6C	0670033456	110174778	Leonardo da Vinci: Flights of the Mind: A Biography	Books	5	99	106	N	N	A Gripping Study	This is has to be one of the most thorough biographies about Leonardo ever written. The most widely read biography, [[ASIN:0140231757 Leonardo: The Artist and the Man]]\\"(1988) by the Florentine, Serge Bramly, first translated by Jean-Claude Lattes into French, then later translated into English by Sian Reynolds, and published in England in 1995, was highly considered to be the definitive work on the quintessential renaissance man. Having read Bramly's work in 1996, I considered it to be rough going, strangely dense throughout; due, I expect because of its two translations from the original Italian. Reading translations and not knowing the original language can be a dubious experience for the ignorant reader, as particular words and phrases at times appear out of place. That said, reading Nicholl's passionate and adeptly written life history of Leonardo, combining historical investigation with literary speculation, one would have to admit that this work far out shines its predecessor in terms of its accessibility, detail and style. This is a formidable study of the great man and his work.<br /><br />Nicholl's certainly did his research on his subject, pouring over Leonardo's Codex Atlanticus, that displays much of da Vinci's multi-varied interests, ideas and doodles, which reveals the linear and non-linear flow of his mind. The master had so many thoughts and ideas endlessly flowing that it is no wonder that he failed to complete many of his projects and paintings. Nicholl, unlike so many speculators before him, refrained from psychoanalysing this great genius. His method was more to submerge his consciousness into Leonardo's native environment, walk the paths that he walked, and emotionally submerge his soul into the paintings, sculptures and sketches. Nicholl spent years physically, mentally and spiritually with Leonardo, sometimes peering at a particular work for hours on end, to possibly catch a true glimpse into the master's mind. Nicholl's approach was to combine scholarly methodology with literary imagination - and reading his work certainly proves that he has paved new insight into the character of this renaissance genius.<br /><br />This is what makes this work special: Nicholl seems to have left no stone unturned in his analysis of da Vinci's life and work. As he places many of Leonardo's works in the chronological context in which they were created, speculating on da Vinci's stage of \\"maturity\\" and the social and political events manifesting at the time, we get a real sense of the man, and the developing stages of his work, ending in his self-imposed exile and dignified death with the French king, Francois I.<br /><br />The text includes well-produced mono and colour images of da Vinci's work. Nicholl's Notes and Bibliography are relatively extensive and valuable for the student of da Vinci and the renaissance as a whole.<br /><br />This biography is an entertaining and gripping study of one of the most fascinating artists in history.arly methodology with literary imagination - and reading his work certainly proves that he has paved new insight into the character of this renaissance genius.

In the Preface of this highly informative and entertaining collection of musings, experiences and travels of the body, mind and spirit, Crichton explains the reasons that prompted him to write this book:<br /><br />\\"If you are a writer, the assimilation of important experiences almost obliges you to write about them. Writing is how you make the experience your own, how you explore what it means to you, how you come to possess it, and ultimately release it.\\"<br /><br />Crichton explores our need for direct experience. His premise is that modern man has lost his innate sense of himself and existence, relying on opinions, concepts and information structures, second hand knowledge, in order to make sense of the world, which, in the end, is a false perception. He proposes that the modern city-dweller, for example, cannot even see the stars at night due to the false light around him, causing a serious alienation from himself and reality. We've become so reliant on the media, hyper -realty, that simulation has become the real, thus we have generally lost our bearings, we have lost track of ourselves in relation to the greater scheme of things. Travel for Crichton, then, helped him to have \\"direct experience\\", thus achieving a greater sense of himself and his place on the planet. This book is about these direct experiences.<br /><br />In Travels there are twenty- eight essays covering the author's early life in medical school and his bout with psychiatry, moving on to his first years in Hollywood as an aspiring writer and filmmaker, to his experiences in exotic lands and his musings on his experiences with the esoteric and the unexplained.  These last essays are extremely interesting because Crichton attempts to rationally explain those phenomenon that dwell in the irrational - entities, other dimensional realms and the underrated \\"sixth\\" sense, that we've come to know as intuition. His proposition is that, fundamentally, just because certain phenomena cannot be explained \\"rationally\\", doesn't mean it doesn't exist. And to dismiss such phenomenon because it cannot hold up under the rigors of scientific analysis, is a mistake.<br /><br />Crichton's Travels is a writer's exploration of himself and the world. It is an entertaining chronicle, at times hilarious and sad, and ultimately a strong argument for the need for all of us to have \\"direct experience\\", reinforcing his view that we also need greater insight into the mystical as well as the scientific, in order to truly understand ourselves and existence.<br /><br />As usual, similar to all his books, Crichton has given us something informative, as well as tremendously entertaining.ined \\"rationally\\", doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

In \\"On Life After Death\\", she discusses her twenty-five year research with the dying, illustrating what actually occurs to the person at the moment of death, taken from thousands of interviews with those that have had a near death experience, (NDE) concluding that this experience is virtually the same for everyone.<br /><br />The book contains four essays on the subject. In the first essay she states her argument without hesitation, stating emphatically that after interviewing thousands of dying men, women and children, all told her virtually the same experience. They begin by having an out-of-the-body occurrence and a feeling of wholeness, and heightened awareness. These individuals reported \\"seeing\\" doctors, nurses and loved one's while they were clinically dead. She also goes onto explain that we are never alone when we begin to pass on, that there is always someone, a deceased family member, a guarding angel or guide to help us through this transition.<br /><br />One of the more compelling stories Kubler-Ross conveys was the visitation from an old, deceased patient. The doctor was at a difficult time in her career, and she wanted to resign from her work with the dying. One day after delivering a seminar on the subject, she met her boss to resign when in the open elevator stood an old patient, Mrs. Schwartz. This individual was the first patient that Dr. Kubler-Ross interviewed for her studies on NDE, and had recently died. Mrs. Schwartz told her that she had \\"come back\\" for two reasons, first to thank the doctor for her help and also to persuade her to continue her work with the dying. As a scientist, Dr. Kubler-Ross did not want to believe she was speaking with a dead patient, and to prove to herself that this experience was indeed happening, the doctor put across to Mrs. Schwartz to write her a note, stating her request. Astonishingly, Dr. Kubler-Ross has this note in her possession to this day, and kept her promise to continue her work with the dying. As a scientist, writing about this experience and speaking about it to hundreds of people and colleagues, must have taken considerable courage.<br /><br />Dr. Kubler-Ross is recognized as the world's foremost expert on the subject of death, the process of dying and the afterlife. These four astounding essays are  written clearly and persuasively based on years of research on literarily thousands of patients.<br /><br />This is an important book.

The fairy tale is an important part of this tradition that has a long and rich history spanning thousands of years.<br /><br />First published in 1975, Bruno Bettleheim, one of Sigmund Freud's followers and an important contributor to psychoanalysis, has written an incredible book, suggesting that the fairy tale has a pedagogical use, educating the child about the struggles in life, that these struggles are an intrinsic aspect of existence. Following Plato, he believes that the literary education of children should begin with the telling of myths. In other words, the fairy tale can present models for behaviour, providing meaning and value to our lives. This wonderful book expresses this view extremely well and also provides a frame of reference towards the child's overall psychological development.<br /><br />I have read Freud for some years, and nowhere, including Freud himself, have I read a more succinctly expressed view on the ultimate purpose of psychoanalysis, than in this book by Dr. Bettleheim, he writes,<br /><br />\\"Psychoanalysis was created to enable man to accept the problematic nature of life without being defeated by it, or giving in to escapism. Freud's prescription is that only by struggling courageously against what seems like unwieldy odds can man succeed in wringing meaning out of existence.\\" (P.8)<br /><br />Fairy tales inform us about life's struggles, hardships and the reality of death. From Bettleheim's point of view, the fairy tale is a \\"manifold form\\" that communicates to the child, educates them, against life's vagaries and realities, which are the unavoidable aspects of our existence. More specifically, the fairy tale is an educational tool to help children grow and develop into adults. He goes on to say that the child needs to be given \\"...suggestions in symbolic form about how he may deal with these issues and grow safely into maturity.\\" (P.9)<br /><br />Bettleheim adeptly sets out to prove his theses by analysing well known fairy tales in the context of psychoanalytic theory, persuasively arguing the value of these tales towards the child's psychological development.<br /><br />If you are interested in psychoanalysis and would like to know more about the profound positive effects the telling of fairy tales can have on our young, this incredible book is indispensable.with these issues and grow safely into maturity.\\" (P.9) <br /> <br />Bettleheim adeptly sets out to prove his theses by analysing well known fairy tales in the context of psychoanalytic theory, persuasively arguing the value of these tales towards the child's psychological development.  <br /> <br />If you are interested in psychoanalysis and would like to know more about the profound positive effects the telling of fairy tales can have on our young, this incredible book is indispensable.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-04-28

Included in this overwhelming collection are 114 essays, in some cases, randomly categorized into three chapters - State of Art, State of the Union and State of Being. Vidal is an intensely knowledgeable fellow, and therefore has an opinion on just about everything having to do with art, history, politics, the state of literature and his beloved Republic To attempt to read this entire tome (1271 pages) from start to finish over a few weeks (my original intention) proved to be impossible. Although informative and extremely entertaining, there was just too much to digest, too important to scan through, thus I would mark the essays read with a tick on the contents page, place the book back on the shelf, only to return when the time felt right to take them up again.<br /><br />Vidal is not only a great historian, he is also one of America's great literary radicals. He was experimenting with the literary form, attempting to apply critical theory to the Novel very early in the piece with such works as Duluth, Mira Breckinridge and the post modern religious satire, Live from Golgotha. These were indeed \\"radical\\" departures from the standard fare of American novels coming out at the time. In mainstream circles, however, these novels were not well received, but were critically acclaimed, calling them subversive, iconoclastic, original and extremely funny.<br /><br />As an essayist, Vidal really has no match in American letters. These essays reveal a master at the top of their form. What is interesting as well as admirable, Vidal was criticising literary theory which had infiltrated academia in the late 60's and early 70's, al la, post structuralism and deconstructionism, but unlike the so-called \\"experts\\" in the university's across the western world, (he calls them \\"Hacks of Academia\\") Vidal attempted to put these theories to the test in the form of a popular novel, (Duluth) and succeeded. In his essay, \\"French Letters -Theories of the Modern Novel\\", Vidal attacks these modern theorists, who state that language and literature as an art form is dead, in elegant prose and biting gusto, revealing their empty (headed) arguments,<br /><br />\\"In any case, rather like priests who have forgotten the meaning of the prayer they chant, we shall go on for quite as long time talking of books and writing books, pretending all the while not to notice that the church is empty and the parishioners have gone elsewhere to attend other gods, perhaps with silence or with new words.\\" (1967, p.110)<br /><br />In \\"The State of the Union\\" essays, Vidal expounds upon American politics and his views on the National Security Council, the CIA and America's on-going imperialistic intentions, which interestingly, have not dated in the least. Most of these essays are as relevant as ever despite the passing of over thirty years.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that reading Vidal is an education, showing us a way through the miasma of received wisdom, relentlessly thrown in our direction. In many respects Vidal is a beacon of light during dark times, a writer that has never pulled any punches when it came to the things he believed in, namely writing, politics and his beloved Republic.

Similar to any school of thought, Jung's depth psychology has its own unique language, and understanding these specialized terms is essential to grasping even a small portion of the subject. In Jung's later years, he dreamed of speaking to a multitude of people about the collective unconscious and its symbols. This dream proved to be very important to the old doctor because he sincerely believed that modern civilization was coming to an end and thought it a dire necessity that his work be understood by the wider public in order for a kind of \\"collective-psychic-healing\\" to begin. In the end, he at least wanted the \\"educated layman\\" to have a fundamental understanding of the mind. Man and his Symbols is a successful attempt towards this goal.<br /><br />Dr. Jung dictated part one of this book, \\"Approaching the Unconscious\\". For the most part, however, this is a collaboration of Jungians writing on the subject's most basic tenets, such as the nature of the unconscious, the collective unconscious and its dreams and symbols.<br /><br />In part two, \\"Ancient Myths and Modern Man\\", Dr. Joseph L. Henderson elaborates on historical symbols as archetypes, including the Hero myth and the Archetype as Initiation that has been seen and experienced throughout the ages.<br /><br />In part three, the famed Jungian, M. L. von Franz, explores `The Process of Individuation\\", explaining the psyche's natural evolution towards a state of uniting its opposites and becoming whole. Franz details this abstract process in very simple terms, revealing the ultimate goal of all therapies: balance, wholeness and responsibility.<br /><br />Aniela Jaffe, another one of the original Jungian's, in part four, expounds on the nature of the symbol in the visual arts. This is a revealing chapter as it illustrates how so many similar symbols have appeared in art throughout the world over thousands of years.<br /><br />Jolande Jacobi, the famed Jungian analyst, in part five, relates the methods of Jungian analysis in terms of the importance of dreams and symbols.<br /><br />Lastly, von Franz concludes with a brilliant essay on \\"Science and the Unconscious\\", summarizing the entire book, and emphasising the importance of symbols and the unconscious and their on-going interpretation in the effort to understanding ourselves.<br /><br />As was the old doctor's wish, Man and his Symbols opened Jung's work to a wider public. It is an ideal text for anyone interested in analytical psychology, as it explains the subjects at times abstract notions of the mind and the psyche's relation to the world in highly accessible terms. It provides the necessary basics for a general understanding and is a perfect springboard for further study.the world over thousands of years.  <br /> <br />Jolande Jacobi, the famed Jungian analyst, in part five, relates the methods of Jungian analysis in terms of the importance of dreams and symbols.  <br /> <br />Lastly, von Franz concludes with a brilliant essay on \\"Science and the Unconscious\\", summarizing the entire book, and emphasising the importance of symbols and the unconscious and their on-going interpretation in the effort to understanding ourselves. <br /> <br />As was the old doctor's wish, Man and his Symbols opened Jung's work to a wider public.

In this work, The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age, what has been known as `occult philosophy' in the Renaissance, revived by Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, she explores the \\"Christianized\\" version of the Jewish Cabala, and its manifestation and influential affects on religious and philosophical ideas, including the arts, during the Elizabethan Age.<br /><br />Yates begins with her proposed theses that, in past analyses of occult philosophy, it has focused primarily on the Hermetic tradition. She claims that this occult tradition should be called the \\"Hermetic-Cabalist\\", as the ideas are not solely Hermetic in nature, but have a strong Jewish Cabalistic influence, albeit in a Christianized form, as formulated by Marsilio Ficino.<br /><br />This text is a rich analysis on the history of ideas. Yates adeptly sketches the influences of the hermetic-cabala in the Renaissance, moving forward to one of the more influential texts that affected this tradition more than any other treatise, Henry Cornelius Agrippa's, Three Books of Occult Philosophy. She also focuses her study on three other influential personages, the Cabalist Friar, Francesco Giorgi, and his work, \\"De harmonia mundi\\", and the works of Johannes Reuchlin. Yates also looks at the mysterious Elizabethan magus, Dr. John Dee, known as the \\"Queen's Conjurer\\" citing the doctor's primary sources of his own work directly to Agrippa. Her claim is that John Dee, was in fact, along with Agrippa, Giorgi and Reuchlin, Christian Cabalists.<br /><br />The theme of this work is that there was a philosophy of the occult from the Italian Renaissance that operated and was renewed in the Elizabethan Renaissance. To back this thesis, she cites examples from great works of Elizabethan literature that have strikingly blatant examples of this occult philosophy, such as Spenser's The Faerie Queene; Christopher Marlowe's famous play, Doctor Faustus; and Shakespeare's A Mid Summer Night's Dream, Hamlet, King Lear and, of course, The Tempest. What these works of literature have in common are expressed tenets of the Christian Cabalist occult tradition, alluding to the works and lives of Agrippa and John Dee. Yates' arguments are compelling and deserve, as she herself notes, further study by scholars.<br /><br />This was Yates' last work. She has become one of the most read and respected scholars on the history of the esoteric tradition. This work brings to light an intellectual movement that has been suppressed or dismissed by \\"serious' scholars as superstitious or irrelevant at best. It is because of her research that these once suppressed intellectual movements have regained legitimacy in the history of ideas and their relevance to the development of Western thought.<br /><br />The text's style is not only written for the scholar or academic, but fortunately can also be read by the laymen interested in the history of the Western occult tradition.t philosophy, such as Spenser's The Faerie Queene; Christopher Marlowe's famous play, Doctor Faustus; and Shakespeare's A Mid Summer Night's Dream, Hamlet, King Lear and, of course, The Tempest.

As the character in Ulysses, Bloom, stumbles through the streets of Dublin, free-associating on Shakespeare and theosophy, music, love and politics, so too does McEwan's character, Henry Perowne, a neurosurgeon, who attains a state of epiphany at the beginning of the novel, as he observes a fiery meteor or jet streak across the early morning sky.<br /><br />Perowne experiences a moment of intense clarity, which sets his mind in motion, moving in many directions, contemplating the nature of consciousness, musings on society, family, work, sex and politics, and ultimately the human condition in general. He traverses the streets of London in his Mercedes, has a minor car accident, plays a hard game of squash with a colleague, shops for the evenings meal, visits his mother in a nursing home, to then come full circle where he experiences a startling situation in his home. On the surface these are mundane events, but it is his thoughts that are triggered by the details, that represent wider concerns. Similar to Joyce's Ulysses, London like Dublin, Perowne like Bloom, becomes a microcosm, our world in miniature, in an attempt to make sense of it all.<br /><br />McEwan is a mature writer. Perowne's thoughts and free-associations pull us into our own concerns about who we are and the absurdity of our modern world. As a neurosurgeon, Henry Perowne is typically a realist, a man who values control, facts and the comfort of rational thinking. He is a man who keeps his emotions in check, is not prone to flights of fancy, but knows in his heart that, as a human being, he is deficit in many respects. Perowne's daughter, Daisy, is a young poet, who forces her father to read Romantic 19th century literature and poetry, but Perowne tries to view the world through the eyes of a poet and finds it terribly difficult. But what does it mean to be truly human? In the end, Perowne, based on his instincts, even without thinking it through, being rational, reveals a man with a tremendous capacity for compassion. He does show us what being human truly is...<br /><br />The novel ends where it begins, Perowne has come full circle, gazing out his window at the early morning sky, but he has changed. It is not an earth shattering transformation, a glimpse at the secrets of our existence, however he does attain a subtle certainty, a personal knowingness, about his place in the world.<br /><br />Saturday is an excellent novel.iterature and poetry, but Perowne tries to view the world through the eyes of a poet and finds it terribly difficult.

US	45814424	R2W1P7MWRJIDAK	0375420835	996900652	Status Anxiety	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Practical Philosophy	What use is the subject of philosophy if its ideas and tenets have no bearing on our personal lives? The twentieth century has seen philosophy attenuate into a specialized ugly stepsister of the humanities, pronounced irrelevant by insecure, materialist - centred academics, having no \\"practical value\\" to the modern world. To a certain extent this was indeed a reality, as the subject \\"theorized\\" itself almost out of existence. This is changing, however, as philosophy is slowly being perceived as a method to bring meaning to our lives - in practical ways. Leading the cause to take the subject to a state of practical relevance is Alain de Botton, author of such best selling texts as \\"The Consolations of Philosophy\\", \\"The Art of Travel\\" and \\"How Proust Can Change Your Life.\\" De Botton's skill lies in his ability to interpret great works of philosophy, art and literature, and re-mould age-old notions into workable methods of application to the personal and everyday. In this text, he explores the universal social condition of Status Anxiety; our fears about what others think about our success and failures, how we are judged by society based on societies value systems, placing us in categories of winners and losers, and how our status is actually historically specific, (society's values change through time) and, more importantly, what determines elite status, is usually imposed values by the elites, to control our behaviours, pushing us to seek material status, at the expense of our souls.<br /><br />De Botton states his thesis for the book:<br /><br />\\"That status anxiety possesses an exceptional capacity to inspire sorrow.<br /><br />That the hunger for status, like all appetites, can have its uses: spurring us to do justice to our talents, encouraging excellence, restraining us from harmful eccentricities and cementing members of a society around a common value system. But, like all appetites, its excesses can also kill.<br /><br />The most profitable way of addressing the condition may be to attempt to understand and to speak of it.\\" (P.5)<br /><br />De Botton proposes five categories of cause for the condition of status anxiety - lovelessness, snobbery, expectation, meritocracy and dependence. He then explores possible solutions to the condition in five groups of study - philosophy, art, politics Christianity and bohemia.<br /><br />In the end, possessing any form of status anxiety is unavoidable. What de Botton proposes, however, is that we have the power to choose what is most valuable in our lives, despite what society dictates we should hold in high esteem. It is also important to have a critical eye towards the at times subtle machinations of our media, communicated in seductive tones, as to what is important, money, power and material possessions or a loving family, productive relationships, charity and compassion.<br /><br />This book succeeds in so far as revealing that there is more than one way in providing meaning to our lives other than what is dictated by the majority as to what determines true value and our so-called status in society.dressing the condition may be to attempt to understand and to speak of it.\\" (P.5) <br /> <br />De Botton proposes five categories of cause for the condition of status anxiety - lovelessness, snobbery, expectation, meritocracy and dependence.

Doyle's essay touches upon all aspects of the revolution's origins of development, including major personages, ideologies and significant events that contributed to its beginnings, processes and the revolution's present legacy in terms of its significant influence on society to present time.<br /><br />In the first chapter, Echoes, Doyle proposes that one cannot look at France or visit the country without seeing some aspect of the revolution. The Eiffel Tower, for instance, was the centrepiece of the great exhibition that marked the first centenary in 1889. He continues,<br /><br />\\"Nobody who lived in France, or visited it, could avoid these echoes, or echoes of Napoleon, who had marched under the tricolour, had tamed and harnessed the energies unleashed by the revolution, and whose nephew Napoleon III had ruled for 22 years before the Third Republic was established. (P.2)<br /><br />Doyle tackles this project in six comprehensive chapters. \\"Echoes\\" - the influence of the revolution that can be seen in all aspects of society, socially and politically; \\"Why it Happened\\" - the wide and varied reasons as to why the revolution occurred; \\"How it Happened\\" - events such as the Reign of Terror, and the establishment of a National Sovereignty, the many reforms, civil war and the wars abroad, ending with the rise and influence of Napoleon the First; \\"What it Ended\\" - the Monarchy, the fall of the Nobility and the Church; \\"What it Started\\" - a democratic system, an assertion of National Sovereignty....\\"not kings, not hereditary elites, not churches were the supreme source of authority in human affairs.\\" (P.81) And lastly, \\"Where it Stands\\" - how we view the revolution in present time, i.e., the classic interpretation, the revisionist and post revisionist interpretations, and its significance today.<br /><br />If one were starting a comprehensive study of the French revolution, this comprehensive essay, a little over one hundred pages, would be an advisable place to begin. The literature on this subject is enormous, thus Doyle gives us a list of further reading from General Surveys, Origins, Interpretations to People and Legacies.<br /><br />This little book is highly recommended for the student, amateur historian or the simply curious.editary elites, not churches were the supreme source of authority in human affairs.\\" (P.81) And lastly, \\"Where it Stands\\" - how we view the revolution in present time, i.e., the classic interpretation, the revisionist and post revisionist interpretations, and its significance today. <br /> <br />If one were starting a comprehensive study of the French revolution, this comprehensive essay, a little over one hundred pages, would be an advisable place to begin.

When Miller refers to the \\"gifted\\" child, she means the sensitive, aware and impressionable child who, because of the unconscious projections of the parent on the child, the child, in the process of their early development, splits from their true self, denies their true instinctual feelings, in order to live up to the behavioural structures imposed by the parent. Miller writes:<br /><br />\\"Yet, what is missing above all is the framework within the child could experience his feelings and his emotions. Instead, he develops something the mother needs, and this certainty saves his life (the mother's and father's love) at the time, but it nevertheless may prevent him, throughout his life, from being himself.\\" (P. 34-5)<br /><br />The narcissistically cathected child, that is, the child who has internalized the behaviour expectations of the parent, at the expense of his own feelings, in most cases, develops intellectually, but remains stunted in the world of emotions. This contributes to the creation of a \\"false self\\"; this in turn creates distinct symptomatic behaviour in the form of \\"grandiosity\\" or depression.<br /><br />The gifted child will conform or adapt to the unconscious manipulations of the parent in order to avoid losing the parent's love. Miller writes,<br /><br />\\"Thus under certain circumstances, a child may learn very early what he is not allowed to feel, lest he run the risk of losing his mother's love.\\" (P.46)<br /><br />In Miller's clear and accessible prose, she describes many examples of psychoanalytic therapy and it positive effects through the patient's discovery of the parents of his early years during that crucial stage of the analysis, the transference, thereby becoming consciously aware of his parent's \\"unconscious manipulations\\", thus, it is hoped, over time, becoming free from them.<br /><br />This is an important book because it opens the door to a greater understanding in the way we see children, discovering the \\"manipulations\\" that have been imposed on us as children, thus avoiding making the same mistake with our own children. In the end, really, it is letting our children express their feelings no matter how these feelings cause us discomfort socially and otherwise - granting children the space to grow and develop, to develop into the people they truly are.<br /><br />This book is not \\"clinical\\" in its approach, but is written with a compassionate concern.

He discovers early in his sadistic career, that by inducing fear in his victims, the rush is the best he can attain. Mixing drugs and torture, he has found the perfect combination. Simon is a smart killer, sophisticated, and plans his fear games to the last detail. He is also rich and can spend full time exploring this deadly activity.<br /><br />Enter Special Agent Pender, a large, witty and terribly dressed veteran of the FBI on the verge of his retirement. Pender is a likable fellow - he drinks too much, a live-alone divorcee, at the end of a long career. But appearances can be deceiving because this roly-poly officer of the law has been chasing serial killers for twenty years and knows how they think.<br /><br />Dorie Bell is a middle-aged artist with an unusual phobia - prosoponophobia, fear of masks. Simon has her in his reptilian sights and when she least expects it, he strikes and his malevolent activities begin.<br /><br />Nasaw writes his descriptions realistically and effortlessly. He's a visual writer, placing the reader directly into his scenes. As you turn the pages of this novel, the images of Simon's sadistic games appear before your eyes - Nasaw is a fly-on-the-wall- writer, which makes this kind of story that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />As a fan of this genre, I'm intrigued how so many good writers out there can continue to come up with new spins on the ways and methods of the serial killer; Nasaw certainly ranks with the best of them. He seems confident with this genre and writes it superbly well.	2005-03-05

Most of us have experienced a split second of \\"knowingness\\" when confronted by a particular individual or circumstance - the heart pounds faster, the hands become clammy; \\"something\\" tells us to steer clear of this person or situation, only to discover later that our instincts were absolutely right. I cannot count the numerous occasions this has occurred over the years. This instinct we all possess is hard wired in our brains, fined tuned over millions of years of evolution. Of course this is nothing new. We have always been told to \\"trust\\" this inner voice, to run with it, that it is, more often than not, the right call. However, this is not always the case. As Gladwell points out in \\"Blink\\", our unconscious minds can be influenced by implicit cultural conditions, and this \\"instinct\\" can be terribly wrong, leading in some extreme cases, to total disaster.<br /><br />Gladwell's message is that these implicit feelings, these instinctive signs, is one of the more powerful skills we posses. He suggests that our so-called \\"snap-judgement\\" based on \\"thin slicing\\", that is computing minimal but important observations from the environment, can be fined tuned. Unfortunately, he does not explain exactly how this \\"fine-tuning\\" can be effectively done. If we are all simply products of our environment, conditioned from an early age to believe and see the world in a certain way, how is it possible to \\"un-learn\\" the false data we've accumulated over a lifetime, to ensure our \\"snap-judgements\\" are the right ones?<br /><br />As Gladwell does in his best selling book, The Tipping Point, he supplies the reader with a plethora of examples and tests to substantiate his arguments. The most interesting example was the gentleman who could \\"read minds\\" solely based on interpreting facial expressions. In the studies of Paul Ekman and Wallace Freisen, they focus on the literally thousands of facial expressions we learn from infancy, and how a vast majority of our expressions are involuntary, revealing our true and innermost thoughts. Gladwell suggests that all of us, at least unconsciously, can read these expressions, which aid us in interpreting and contextualizing our environment.<br /><br />\\"Blink\\" is an interesting discussion on our instincts, proposing that operating on less information and following our \\"guts\\" is usually the wiser path. Gladwell's conclusion, however, is an age-old one, and that is attaining a balance between body, mind and spirit. The ancient Greeks gave this same advice over three thousand years ago. It is good advice, but similar to anything apparently simple, it is easier said than done.tary, revealing our true and innermost thoughts.

The Rule of Four in many respects is an entertaining, informative and inspiring piece of literature. One can also perceive in this book a deep respect and a genuine awe for writing and literature in general. In a way, The Rule of Four is a tribute to literature, scholarship, and ultimately, art and beauty. At the risk of sounding old fashion, this novel exalts the power of the written word, how literature, for some, can be an all-consuming activity, taking precedence above even survival itself.<br /><br />Literature was once viewed in the halls of academia as merely a collage of signs and signifiers, a post-structuralist game of deconstruction for its own sake. In the not so distant past, literature and true scholarship lost its magic, and was unduly relegated to lowbrow modernism, advertising copy, where the rules were tossed aside and the dictate was, \\"Anything Goes.\\" This book, in many ways, is a backlash to that postmodern sensibility, pulling literature, history and philosophy out of its \\"meaningless deconstructive hell\\", realigning art to where it belongs, and that is a royal road, a secret key or direct conduit back to the gods themselves.<br /><br />To compare this novel to the Da Vinci Code is a great disservice. This book has nothing to do with the alleged bloodline of the Saviour. It has nothing to do with the Holy Grail, Leonardo da Vinci or Mary Magellan. The book does hold a deep Renaissance secret, however, centred during 15th century Florence, but that's its only connection. What this book is about, then, is the power of the written word, and the secrets and passions it contains. The book is about obsession, the almost visceral need for knowledge and the pure delight and suffering one can experience while on that journey. The Sign of Four is also about friendship, enduring friendship, and the sacrifices one makes to ensure friendship lasts.<br /><br />Close to the end of the book, when the character of Paul finally discovers the \\"secret\\" of the Hypnerotomachia, the manuscript under study, he describes Renaissance Florence and its intensely creative period during the late 15th century; this would have to be one of the most entertainingly descriptive monologues that I've ever read about the renaissance.<br /><br />The Rule of Four is a well-crafted, well-edited and confident piece of fiction. The authors worked on the piece for six year after their graduation from Princeton University. I believe it was time well spent as the book is not only entertaining but also informative, and in the end, inspiring.ript under study, he describes Renaissance Florence and its intensely creative period during the late 15th century; this would have to be one of the most entertainingly descriptive monologues that I've ever read about the renaissance.

This is an original and absorbing social thesis. Gladwell has taken a fresh perspective on those elements in society that determine radical change. Why do certain trends like fashion or political opinion, explode in popularity, while others never get off the ground?  He proposes that certain ideas or trends act similarly to epidemics, spreading at a fantastic rate, spreading across populations like the bubonic plague or the Aids virus. From Gladwell's analysis, he has pin-pointed three distinct causes for what he has called \\"The Tipping Point\\" - three agents of influence, acting individually or collectively, which \\"tip the scales\\", so to speak, in the direction of profound change.<br /><br />These three agents of change include: The Law of the Few - individuals of charm and influence, called Connectors, Mavens and Salesman, who are responsible for that essential ingredient of change, word-of mouth. The second agent is The Stickiness Factor - that one seemingly insignificant point that ensures the idea or trend is memorable, the message sticks in the mind. The third agent of change is The Power of Context - this factor focuses on the importance of environment, how context influences our various behaviours in significant ways.<br /><br />The compelling example Gladwell uses to illustrate the power of context was the crime rate in New York City during the late eighties and early nineties. Crime was out of control, murders and muggings were reaching all time highs. Then, over a short period of time, the crime rate plummeted radically. Gladwell speculates that the cause for this extreme decline in crime was due to a massive environmental clean up across the city. The New York Transit Authority, for example, embarked on a massive assault on graffiti and fare evasion, and once the trains were graffiti free and fare protocols were put in place, crime in the subways dropped. He attributes this to \\"the broken window effect\\", a theory that speculates that environment plays a significant influence on the behaviours of criminals. In other words, the criminal is more inclined to commit crime in a debilitated environment than one that is clean, graffiti free with no broken windows. This may sound a little hard to believe, however, the strategy worked and the crime rate tumbled to all time lows.<br /><br />The book is strewn with examples and studies supporting his view that the three factors mentioned above, are the catalyst for radical social movement and trends across society.<br /><br />Gladwell also writes persuasively as his arguments are well researched and suggestive of great insight into the behaviours of society and the specific dynamics that underpin these behaviours. He gives the impression that he's on to something important, that if constructively harnessed, could well provide us with the means to change the negative aspects of our world for the better.ignificant influence on the behaviours of criminals.

Conversely, does the human being ultimately have freedom of choice? Can she/he, then, transcend these so-called deterministic factors, choose how to respond to the world and live with imposed suffering? In the end, is it conceivably possible to find \\"meaning\\" in our suffering?<br /><br />In this book, Dr. Frankl addresses these important questions, illustrating his terrible experiences as an inmate of the Nazi concentration camps, leading to his discovery of \\"Logotherapy\\" - a revolutionary approach to psychotherapy, that places emphasis on the human being's \\"will-to-meaning\\".<br /><br />The unmentionable atrocities in the Nazi concentration camps of WWII have been well documented. However, Dr. Frankl does not focus on the atrocities themselves, but the numerous ways his fellow inmates \\"responded\\" to the suffering inflicted upon them by their captors. Frankl emphasises that the prisoners of these camps must not be viewed as mere expressions of certain physical and sociological conditions, he writes,<br /><br />\\"Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influence alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him - mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp.\\" (P.87)<br /><br />The inmates' survival and sanity depended upon a fundamental inner decision, a choice, in terms of how they responded, mentally and spiritually, to these indignities. From Frankl's observations of his fellow prisoners and his own experiences, brought him to conclude, that,<br /><br />\\"We have stated that that which was, ultimately responsible for the state of the prisoner's inner self was not so much the enumerated psychophysical causes as it was the result of a free decision.\\" (P.90)<br /><br />Those individuals who discovered meaning in their suffering and a faith in the future, maintained an attitude of survival, and had a better chance at staying alive.<br /><br />\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is a powerful text, which explores issues of profound significance, with clarity and humaneness. This is also a highly credible book, because it is written by a man who experienced first hand man's inhumanity to man, and from these unspeakable indignities, discovered a psychology of hope, which can be applied across the entire spectrum of the human condition.h was, ultimately responsible for the state of the prisoner's inner self was not so much the enumerated psychophysical causes as it was the result of a free decision.\\" (P.90)    Those individuals who discovered meaning in their suffering and a faith in the future, maintained an attitude of survival, and had a better chance at staying alive.     \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is a powerful text, which explores issues of profound significance, with clarity and humaneness.

A man built like a defensive linebacker, shaved skull, and biceps the size of cannons, tattoos and beady eyes, does not necessarily mean this individual is a menace to society, he could be as harmless as a pussy cat. On the other hand, a small young woman with coke bottle glasses, mousy hair, and unusual scars and larger than average breasts, on the surface, would seem quite harmless, then again, she could well be your worst nightmare. Appearances can be deceiving, as they most certainly are in this original debut novel.<br /><br />As critics from around the world have commented, this novel defies categorization. At a cursory glance, this novel is a macabre tale about a nervous young woman obsessed with picking up male hitchhikers who must adhere to a specific criteria - preferably well built, more muscle than fat, no apparent diseases, and no immediate family connections. In fact, her ideal target is a drifter or vagabond, someone down on his luck, with nothing else to lose. Her stalking ritual is quite precise: spot the intended victim, pass them on the road once to size them up, ensuring they meet her standard, then circle around again. After asking a few essential question about their background and current situation, Isserley makes her decision, and then...<br /><br />As you read further into the novel, her reasons for stalking this particular type of hitchhiker becomes clear. On the surface, the novel is an original tale that for some readers would be entertaining, while for others not interested in this sort of subject matter, might be disappointed. However, for the more discerning reader, the story really is a metaphor about society, how we all too often judge people on their appearances, our preconceived stereotypes, to suit our own purposes and ends.<br /><br />Faber's writing is sparse, at times lyrical, though packs a lethal punch. He can describe the banal day to day against the utterly bizarre, creating an otherworldly atmosphere, yet at the same time, makes it totally believable.<br /><br />This is a remarkable book on many levels, as its themes and images should remain with you for a long time.describe the banal day to day against the utterly bizarre, creating an otherworldly atmosphere, yet at the same time, makes it totally believable.  <br /> <br />This is a remarkable book on many levels, as its themes and images should remain with you for a long time.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-10

In \\"Seeing Voices\\", he permits us entry into the silent, at times strange, though culturally rich world of the congenitally and pre-lingually deaf.<br /><br />As someone who has had no previous experience or knowledge in this area, for me this text opened a whole new area of culture and history that is continually growing and developing.<br /><br />Sacks' explores the nature of language, touching upon Noam Chomsky's paradigm-shifting studies, \\"Syntactic Structures\\", \\"Cartesian Linguistics\\" and Language of Mind\\", where he proposes his theory that language is innate, lying dormant until it is made active through human interaction and culture. Sacks connects these theories to the pre-lingual deaf and its implications and manifestations.<br /><br />We are also given a history lesson on the language of SIGN, how it has developed, why it was jettisoned, out of ignorant prejudice, in the late nineteenth century, and its miraculous come back in the twentieth century. Through Sacks' concise and straightforward prose, he connects us to the foreign world of another language not depended on speech, its intricacies and its wonder, and how those of us who have the ability to hear and to verbalize, all too often take language for granted. He also makes clear the sophistication of Sign as a form of legitimate communication, its grammatical foundations and its many nuances, and how, in some ways, it is a superior form of active exchange between people.<br /><br />In chapter three, Sacks tells us about the cultural breakthrough at Gallaudet University in March 1988, where after massive student protest, the school literally closed down, the first ever deaf president of the university was appointed. Sacks witnessed this social changing event first hand, which in the end affected him more than he realized,<br /><br />\\"I had to see this all for myself before I could be moved from my previous \\"medical\\" view of deafness (as a condition, a deficit, that had to be \\"treated\\") to a \\"cultural\\" view of the deaf as forming a community with a complete language and culture of its own.\\" (P.129-30)<br /><br />Indeed this entire text has changed my view that deafness is not simply a condition or human deficit, but another way of being in the world. In fact the deaf, with their shared language are forming a world community and culture crossing all barriers. And as Dr. Sacks points out, in this way, \\"...the deaf have something to teach us.\\" (P. 167)r />In chapter three, Sacks tells us about the cultural breakthrough at Gallaudet University in March 1988, where after massive student protest, the school literally closed down, the first ever deaf president of the university was appointed.

US	45814424	R3S8KB7CZ2R0CC	0060669357	54594301	The Nag Hammadi Library	Books	5	43	45	N	N	For the Scholar and Searcher	For those individuals interested in the evolution of Christian thought, Gnosticism in particular, embarking on a major research project, simply curious about alternative perspectives on the teachings of Jesus Christ, this single volume of fourth-century manuscripts discovered in Egypt in 1945, is absolutely essential.<br /><br />Gnostic thought has always been extremely controversial. Its history and various movements throughout the last millennium are fraught with mystery, censorship, intrigue and bloodshed. As some of the manuscripts pose an entirely different view of the Saviour and His teachings, most traditional Christians dismiss these books entirely. Interestingly, these books have been called \\"heretical\\"; taking the word heresy in the literal sense, meaning to take the position in opposition to the orthodoxy of the time, the Nag Hammadi texts are indeed heretical.<br /><br />Throughout theological history, the teachings of the Gnostics, and our knowledge of them as a movement, has really only been provided by the \\"heresy-hunters\\", (the first Church Father, Irenaeus of Lyons, and his five book treatise, \\"Aversus Haereses\\", translated as, \\"Against Heresies\\", is the most noted) giving scholars a seriously one-sided perspective of Gnostic theology, practices and belief. It was only when the Nag Hammadi manuscripts were discovered in 1945 in Upper Egypt, and then painstakingly translated, that we have a greater insight into Gnostic belief, its history and practice.<br /><br />This edition of the Library has been revised and expanded since it was first published in 1978. General editor, James M. Robinson's Introduction to this volume, in my view, is worth the price of the entire text. He provides for the scholar and curious reader a clear and concise history of these gospels, their at times dubious translations, and general explanation of the library as a whole.<br /><br />The Nag Hammadi library also contains manuscripts or treatises other than religious traditions from the Judeo-Christian heritage. For example, \\"The Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth\\", is a previously unknown Hermetic text, that presents a fascinating dialogue between the deities Hermes Trismegistus and his son Tat. As Robinson points out, a number of texts contained in the library are debatable in terms of being truly Gnostic in nature, depending on the individual interpreter, and how they define Gnosticism. Personally, I'll leave that debate to the scholars, however, the text themselves make captivating reading.<br /><br />Many hours have been spent reading the various manuscripts contained in this volume. It has taken a tremendous amount of energy and concentration on my part to gain an understanding of the spiritual message(s) that some of these texts provide. This is not a quick read, but a long process of study that for me, will continue for years to come.  Having said that, this library is an absolute must as a reference, for any student of theology, Christian history, archaeology and antiquity in general.

Ripley is a highly likable villain, and a type of villain we want to see succeed. He is cultured, well-mannered, loves his beautiful wife, an expert gardener, appreciates fine art, music and beautiful things, but is capable of incredible heinous acts without a second thought.<br /><br />In this last novel, Ripley is living quite comfortably at Belle Ombre, his beautiful home in Villeperce, and seems to be heading for an easy retirement. At the caf&eacute; in town, a strange boy turns up, and through a series of events, the two become good friends. As it turns out, the boy is a runaway from the United States, a member of a wealthy family. The boy has a terrible secret, he has committed murder, and he's on the run from his a family and his conscience.<br /><br />As the tale progresses, Ripley takes on the role of mentor, having murdered many times before, perhaps unconsciously or not, guides the boy psychologically towards a frame of mind or attitude, in order to live with murder. Ripley has the capacity to compartmentalize his thoughts, push his conscience conveniently aside, in order to live with himself. The young lad seems to have the same psychological predisposition, but as the story unfolds, the boy's behaviour points otherwise.<br /><br />This last Ripley novel is different because Ripley takes on the role of mentor and rescuer, saving the boy from the clutches of some unsavoury characters, performing his unique brand of violence which surprises, leaving the reader cold. But in his role as saviour, we cheer him as he commits these unspeakable acts.<br /><br />For me at least, the ending of the novel was not predictable, it was both surprising and incredibly sad on many levels. Most of all, this book is disturbing, illustrating the fact that as human beings, we have the capacity to justify virtually anything, including murder.the role of mentor and rescuer, saving the boy from the clutches of some unsavoury characters, performing his unique brand of violence which surprises, leaving the reader cold.

From Analytical philosophy to Semiotics and Modernism to Post Modernism, readers curious about these subjects now have the opportunity to at least grasp basic tenets and general theories, enabling a solid foundation or spring board to venture into further study. Unfortunately for some, these texts appear infantile, at least in appearance, because they are illustrated in a comic book style, peppered with dubious humour, and so basic, that those `expert' in these subjects believe, at least on a surface level, that they do more harm than good. In other words, this is an effort at mere trivialization of a known serious subject. In my view, this is no more than intellectual snobbery, as these books have indeed paved the way for students interested in complex subjects to grasp their basic tenets and graduate to specific and more sophisticated study.<br /><br />For those not acquainted with Quantum Theory, this text is a must for those interested in further study. It begins with a basic explanation of classic physics and gently brings the reader forward in the subjects fascinating evolution to present day.<br /><br />We are introduced to the theories of Max Planck and his Pre-Atomic Model of Matter. Albert Einstein's theories are explained and expanded upon, along with the \\"Quantum Hero\\" of quantum theory, Neils Bohr. We are guided through the theories of these physics giants, Heisenberg, Schr&ouml;dinger and Wolfgang Pauli with his Anomalous Zeeman Effect, Electron Spin and the Exclusion Principle. These titles seem daunting, but author, J.P. McVoy and illustrator, Oscar Zarate, present these theories in translucent terms and easy-on-the-eye visuals, ensuring the penny drops for all of us.<br /><br />There are two notions in Quantum theory that has always puzzled me. These are the `wave-particle duality and so-called `no-locality' theory where, almost magically, at the sub atomic level, a single particle seems to be \\"aware\\" of what the others are doing. In other words, there is an action and corresponding reaction, transcending the speed of light. This text adequately explains these theories and have made them much more comprehensible than ever before.<br /><br />As an introduction to Quantum Theory, this text is an absolute must for the curious reader or serious student.ed me.

Even more astounding, is the great scientific minds from around the world are putting these seemingly bizarre postulates to the test, and their findings are nothing less than amazing.<br /><br />One of the more interesting chapters \\"Was the Universe Created by Angels?\\" suggests an outlandish idea (outlandish from a secular scientific perspective): that our universe is the outcome of an experiment carried out by a superior intelligence in another universe. What makes this theory plausible is the fact that our universe is based on clear and simple principles that can be observed. Our observable cosmos is orchestrated on basic laws of physics in perfect balance, \\"a fined-tuned universe\\" enabling life to exist and reproduce. This is the anthropic principle:<br /><br />\\"There would appear to be only two possible explanations: One is that the universe was designed specifically by God. The other is that the Universe is the way it is because if it wasn't, we would not be here to remark on the fact. According to this topsy-turvy reasoning...it is hardly surprising that we find ourselves in a universe which is fine-tuned to allow the existence of galaxies, stars and life. We could hardly have evolved in a universe that was not!\\" (P.106)<br /><br /> It is here that philosophy and science merge to attempt to explain the great mysteries of our existence.<br /><br />As a reader not too acquainted with quantum theory, astronomy and physics in general, this text is written simply and straightforward, explaining at times complex physics in easy to comprehend prose.

A man born from humble beginnings, he has re-invented himself as a man of refined taste and breeding. Basic manners and knowledge of human nature, combined with a strong will and bloody attitude of mind, he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. What makes Ripley psychologically fascinating, is his utter lack of conscience. He can murder without a hint of remorse, and has that uncanny ability to compartmentalize his thoughts and memories in order live with his many dastardly deeds. Moreover, Highsmith writes about Ripley entirely from his perspective, giving the reader an inside look at his thought processes, rationalizations and intrigues, creating a sympathy for the man, thus we cheer when he murders and are greatly relieved when he gets away with it. We want Ripley to succeed and he always does.<br /><br />In this story, Ripley's chequered past catches up with him. An American couple, David and Janice Prichard, move into a villa down the way from his chateau at Villeperce. These people know Ripley from somewhere; know aspects about his past that Ripley would soon forget and then begin to relentlessly taunt him. How much do they really know? And how can Ripley handle this strange couple without implicating himself?<br /><br />This book was difficult to put down in many ways. Because Ripley is such a fascinating character, the pages seemed to turn themselves to discover his next move against these people. There is a particular scene in Tangiers at a shady caf&eacute;, where Ripley confronts Prichard, and without warning, in a series of dangerous blows, knocks the vulgar Prichard unconscious. In fact, Highsmith's writing is so good, that I found myself cheering as Ripley pummelled him to the ground. This type of scene, really, has become Ripley's trademark: surprise with lethal violence, applied without mercy or second thought.<br /><br />The Ripley novels are unique in modern crime fiction. Patricia Highsmith was not recognized in her native America, and was forced to move overseas to write, where she became a respected and best selling author. It is only in the last ten years, almost a decade after her death, that she is receiving the acclaim that is so well deserved.Ripley pummelled him to the ground.

In the newspaper game, for example, the battle between the marketing people and editorial continues to rage to this day. In this case, it's a conflict over space; advertising usually wins out over the extra hundred or two hundred words demanded by the journalist. The half page Mercedes-Benz spread takes precedence over editorial and content. In the late eighties, in an effort to maintain journalistic integrity, the \\"advertorial\\" was born. Promotional copy on a product or particular brand was no more in the guise of `real' editorial, either it was journalism or advertising copy, and the twain shall never meet. However, this emphatic separatism has mutated, they have merged, and it is now extremely difficult to distinguish between the two.<br /><br />James Marcus was hired as a senior editor at Amazon.com in 1996. This was a heady period of mind-boggling expansionism and astonishing innovation. Marcus was hired on his skills as a `literary' man, a journalist and critic by trade; he was hired to input his literary insight, his ability to write reviews and articles about books, possibly to guide readers to the pulse of the literary world. But as Amazon evolved, these literary aspirations, Marcus's underlying purist literary sensibilities, clashed with the gruesome reality that Amazon was a business and in the business to sell books, a lot of books. Did he maintain his \\"literary integrity\\", honestly assessing a book on its literary merits, or did he \\"sell out\\", turning his 45 word reviews into mere advertorial?  Only he can answer that. More than anything else, it is the story about the early days at Amazon itself, the genius of Jeff Bezos, and his mission to hire the smartest people from around the world, to turn Amazon into the phenomenon it has become, that makes this book an excellent read.<br /><br />There is a distinct air of lament in this narrative, a disenchantment perhaps, over a fortune lost or a goal not achieved. Marcus sermonizes in parts of the book, at times imparting a condescending tone, and he is also transparently careful not to tread on anyone's toes. Only a fool burns their bridges, however, that hint of bitterness is difficult to ignore.<br /><br />There is no doubt that James Marcus looks back at his time at Amazon, helping to blaze the trail, working along side extremely intelligent people and contributing to the companies meteoric rise, as a privilege and an experience he'll never forget. This sentiment comes through as well.<br /><br />If you have any interest in the history of Amazon from one man's personal perspective, this text would be well worth your time.al not achieved.

Similarly, many call the plight of the convicted murderer on Death Row, cruel and unusual punishment. The date and time of their execution is set, sometimes months or years in the future. The day finally arrives, and for some reason, bureaucratically, legally or otherwise, the execution is moved back. The inmate is made to wait again for their inevitable death. It is known the mind will do strange things under these cruel and unusual circumstances, waiting for the date of their death to arrive. Total insanity, in a few cases, is not out of the question.<br /><br />In Koontz new novel, Jimmy Tock is born into the world with the sword of Damocles poised above him. Tock's grandfather, on the night of his own death, makes five predictions about Jimmy's future, not what will happen but when it will happen to the actual day and year; five terrible days, and there's absolutely nothing poor Jimmy can do about it.<br /><br />Within these pages, Koontz has done what only writer's at the peak of their game can do: and that is portraying the tragic as comedy, and the funny as sad. The Tock family are an unusual bunch. They value the simple aspects of life: cooking and eating good food, interesting conversation, and above all, family. They view the world differently, seeing life's ironies, and the humour and absurdity of the general human condition. I loved these characters, all of them, literally laughing out loud at their many dinner conversations.<br /><br />As I have written somewhere else, Koontz has the gift for describing a character with depth and spirit, in only a few lines. While other writers spend pages and chapters describing a character, this author, with only a few lines of description and a little dialogue, one feels they actually know them. This is a fine gift and Koontz uses it to great effect.<br /><br />For the most part, this story is about, what a character describes herself as having - \\"Indefatigable Optimism\\": never getting tired or giving up, despite the many curve balls that fate throws in our direction.<br /><br />Life Expectancy is a wonderful novel as it shows us that the human being, despite all odds to the contrary, can bounce back, and do it with dash, humour and incredible style.ue, one feels they actually know them.

In fact most of his novels focus on this concern in one way or another. Basically, this concern is the arrogance of science, or more specifically, those individuals or political organizations behind the institutions of science, establishing their authority, pushing their \\"scientific\\" findings in the guise of altruism, but in reality, it is no more than a ruse, in an effort to fulfil some personal or political agenda. He believes that society is in great danger because of the intermixing of science and politics. In Appendix 1 of this novel, he cites a chilling example, supported by prestigious institutions, leading minds, politicians and writers at the time, in the promulgation of eugenics. This was a concerted effort to rid society of their \\"undesirables\\", that is, Jews, illiterates, the feeble minded, foreigners as well as blacks. As is well known, WW2 Germany, took the eugenics ball and ran with it, to the tune of ten million exterminations. Crichton cites this example, I believe, because when science gets into the hands of ideologues and zealots, or particularly individuals with a personal agenda, science becomes a weapon of the strong to fetter the weak. It becomes a tool to create fear in the ignorant masses, in order for those in authority to maintain control over them. The theory of Global Warming and the Greenhouse Effect he uses as an example in his newest novel.<br /><br />As an avid reader of Dr. Crichton for over twenty years, some of his books are spot on the mark, works of uncanny foresight in some cases, while others fail miserably. Personally, I would categorize \\"State of Fear\\" as one of his more researched and better efforts.<br /><br />Environmentalism is a highly contested issue around the planet. The topic of Global Warming has become a part of every middle school curriculum in the Western world. We teach the simple definition, and when students finally understand what the Greenhouse Effect actually is, after hearing the topic pushed in the media for so long, they become quite pleased with themselves. However, as part of the humanities, it is necessary to show all perspectives of a subject, therefore students are shown other studies claiming Global Warming as fiction or simply a theory at best. They then set out on their individual research projects and are expected to argue their chosen perspective with evidence. The better their presentations are argued and the more evidence they provide to back their claims, the better their grade. `State of Fear\\" attempts to cover the many divergent views on this subject, and Crichton does so with multiple references, making this not only an enjoyable ride from a fiction perspective - a well-crafted thriller - but also from an educational stand point. Dr. Crichton should get top marks for this one.<br /><br />As always, when reading a Crichton novel, one invariably learns something, whether quantum mechanics, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence or climatology, one can be certain that the learning experience will be worthwhile as well as entertaining.hat the Greenhouse Effect actually is, after hearing the topic pushed in the media for so long, they become quite pleased with themselves.

A Hebrew man turned Roman solider, childhood friends with Mary Magdalene and the beloved apostle John, Cartaphilus refuses to join his friends and follow this new and rebellious prophet. Although he loves Mary and John more than life itself, and despite their pleads to accept Jesus and his teachings, he remains steadfast in his convictions that Jesus is no more than a clever magi, a false prophet, jealous perhaps, that this man has taken away the two people he loves most in the world. Cartaphilus attends the trial of Jesus as Pontius Pilate hands the final judgement to the crowd, where the crowd unanimously call for the crucifixion of the \\"King of the Jews\\". As Jesus carries the cross to the Place of Skulls and falls for the third time, Cartaphilus calls out and mocks him. Jesus lifts his head, looks at Cartaphilus direct in the eyes, and utters:<br /><br />\\"I will go, but thou shalt tarry until I return.\\"<br /><br />Thus begins this man's immortal journey through two thousand years of history, tirelessly searching, attempting to find the meaning of his existence, protesting constantly at his plight, escaping torture and death, witnessing hundreds of religions and great civilizations rise and crumble, though the central thread of his long existence remains constant - his search for the truth.<br /><br />Most would agree that the Christian legend of Cartaphilus, the Wandering Jew, is a metaphor, some would go as far as to say, a cosmic symbol, of the plight of humankind. Cartaphilus asks the same questions we all ask at one time or another. He recognizes the absurdity and humour of our lives on earth - our suffering, constantly seeking happiness, our search for the divine, our confusion over life's many contradictions, the great love and the great evils that appear to live side by side. Is life merely an illusion, a sadistic trick played on us by some mischievous god? Does our existence abruptly end at death or do we continue on in some other form? As Cartaphilus moves through the centuries, he recognises people, friends and lovers that lived before in other guises, only to come back to him again. He asks, is existence merely circular, recurring again and again? These are profound questions that the cursed one, made to tarry the earth until Christ's return, attempts to answer throughout the ages.<br /><br />Throughout Cartaphilus' journey, we meet great historical personages such as Marcus Aurelius, Nero, Attila the Hun, and Mohammed, Leonardo da Vinci, Spinoza, Peter the Great and many others.

A good example was Adolf Hitler, when the Office of Strategic Services was commissioned to conduct an \\"at-a-distance leader personality assessment in support of policy\\", in which two studies were made, to better understand this dangerous political leader. This particular analysis was so successful that applied psychoanalysis has now become an integral part of America's arsenal in the name of national defence. In this compelling and at times frightening and ultimately sad text, Dr. Frank, in the spirit of these studies, has compiled an in-depth psychological profile, using applied psychoanalysis, on President George W. Bush.<br /><br />What Dr. Frank has unearthed about GWB, should cause great alarm for anyone familiar with human behaviour and what motivates it. This analysis reveals a man with deep-seated problems dating back to his childhood. These unresolved childhood traumas have developed into a dangerous psychic split in his personality, forming a reductionist world view, in terms of infantile binary thinking: us vs. them, good and evil - this reveals a total lack of critical thinking that is so necessary for someone holding the office of president of the United States.<br /><br />An alcoholic turned born-again Christian, here is a man who is a proud semi-literate (he never reads but has his aides explain the contents of newspaper articles and policy documents); here is a deeply conflicted individual who tortured animals for fun as a child; here is a man who allegedly is deeply religious, yet mercilessly bombs Iraq, maiming and killing innocent women and children, and then openly expresses gleeful joy. Bush is a man who cannot answer a direct question, and when out rightly caught in a lie (Iraq possessing WMD) shrugs his shoulders, mumbles something incoherent and adeptly changes the subject. This is a man who is incapable of linear thought, whose \\"minders\\" will not permit him to speak in public for too long without being closely scripted. As most semi-literates do, he struggles with the English language, and is more often confused than not: \\"Is our children learning?\\" \\"I know how hard it is to put food on your family.\\" \\"Our nation must come together to unite.\\" As Dr. Frank points out, these \\"slips\\" may be funny on face value, but these seeming innocent blunders, consistent blunders, are a symptom of something very serious.<br /><br />If GWB was not the president of the United States, and we cared for this individual, a good friend, at least, would gently guide him to receive some kind of treatment. But he is the president, and by all accounts, we have recognized the symptoms, yet we have voted the man in for a second term. Why? In the chapter \\"He's Our Man\\", Dr. Frank gives a compelling explanation, and why Bush appeals to so many voters. The space provided here does not permit an adequate summary, but it makes sense, and is ruthlessly chilling.<br /><br />I've read many current event books this year, and this one has been the most informative, in terms of understanding the cause of the madness that has been manifesting around us.

I waited with great expectation for the publication of this \\"pamphlet\\", Imperial America by Mr. Vidal, following his acclaimed Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace and Dreaming War, because I knew it would cajole, inform and disturb my political senses regarding the current state of the American Republic.<br /><br />An Australian friend of mine once told me that the single thing he loves about American's is their unfaltering idealism, that notion that as a young country, with their Bill of Rights and the Constitution, they could make a difference in the world. Having grown up in the United States and moving abroad, I found myself with this same idealism, at times defending the country from criticism by those who had never lived in the country. I was sometimes fierce in my defence; standing on the table, hand on my heart, pushing the party line to the end. (We are not as loved as you might assume.) To a certain extent this idealism still remains - it never really leaves you. But as the years passed, this idealism considerably waned because as one becomes more informed about history, particularly twentieth century history, America's imperialist intentions, similar to a stinging slap across the face, become more than evident.<br /><br />Mr. Vidal remains an idealist; as America's biographer, he is deeply concerned about his beloved Republic and where, domestically and internationally, it is possibly heading. These essays are confronting and quite disturbing. True to form, however, Mr. Vidal is not a ranting left-wing lunatic, as a few neo-conservatives would have you believe. He points out the problems but also provides solutions.<br /><br />The latest more disturbing news to come out of America is the \\"Help America Vote Act\\" (HAVA), where the old punch -card and lever voting machines are being replaced by Direct Recording Electronic systems, (DREs) where, currently, are being used in thirty-seven states across the country. Anyone with a little knowledge of computers is aware that any information going into them can be altered without detection. Even more telling, the companies who own these machines, because of \\"privacy laws\\", are not compelled to let election observers enter the systems to check for suspected influence: Bingo- potential ballad fraud. Why wasn't the American press jumping all over this story? The first hard news about this came out of New Zealand. Any electronic voting system is highly fallible, and therefore should not even be considered.<br /><br />Similar to Vidal's other two pamphlets, his concerns are repeated here: corporate ownership of political parties; the billions of dollars poured into the defence budget; abolishing the secret agencies i.e. CIA and NSA, turning the economy from a war based to a peace based one. Public supported election campaigns as opposed to corporate contributions, where our politicians are mere bagmen, etc.<br /><br />These are important and terribly confronting essays. These issues are real and should be read, debated and considered. Vidal is an idealist but a practical one and this book should be read by all concerned citizens whether American or not.ters is aware that any information going into them can be altered without detection.

A man of multiple talents and achievements, to count and adequately summarize them all would be an improbable task. This man accomplished more in a lifetime than most of us mere mortals could in several. As a 19th century British explorer, he stands with the legendary - Livingston, Stanley, Baker and Speke. What set him apart from these luminaries, towers above in fact, was is scholarship. His writing talents, publishing countless volumes, his uncanny lingual gift, (twenty-five languages, including several dialects that amount to over forty) and his inroads into anthropology, ethnology, religion and archaeology, make him one of the truly great individuals of the Victorian age. Brodie's treatment of Burton is a worthy tribute to the man, and after reading over four other life histories of Sir Richard; I can say with all honesty, that it is one of the best.<br /><br />I have to admit that I have a severe aversion to that sixties literary trend of applying Freudian psychoanalysis in a biographical study. It is difficult enough analysing the living, let alone the dead and gone. Brodie is guilty of this method in this biography; however, she does it without taking anything away from the subject. Most all the typical psychoanalytical symptoms are present: the Oedipus complex, latent homosexuality, and preoccupations with sex in general. Brodie's analyses, though, is not a closed shop - she remains open to her subject. In other words, her psychoanalytic musings do not cloud the uniqueness and larger than life qualities of this man. It's a side issue, and therefore can be ignored.<br /><br />What is so startling about Burton was his enormous passion to know, his tireless travels and recordings of the unknown and exotic. He not only was everything mentioned above, but a poet of talent, geologist, amateur physician, expert swordsman and skilful spy. A precursor to Freud, he studied the sexual customs of many cultures and was a fierce critic of Victorian values on the subject. This man's curiosity knew no bounds and he ensured he did not waste a minute of his sixty-nine years - a relatively short life considering what the man accomplished.<br /><br />There are many biographies about Burton, but this one seems to encapsulate the man's spirit and zest for life. Brodie writes an enthralling biography and anyone interested in this towering figure of the 19th century, this text is highly recommended.ecursor to Freud, he studied the sexual customs of many cultures and was a fierce critic of Victorian values on the subject.

The book is well-written, splashed with self-deprecating humour and supernatural anecdotes that defy rational logic, but is told in such a matter-of-fact tone, that the reader cannot help but believe them.<br /><br />DuQuette begins his story at his birth and ponders, while only an infant, who and what he is, day dreaming his long past in another life. Some people run the course of their entire lives without coming to terms with who they really are, the discovery of the \\"I\\", and the realization that there is no \\"off\\" switch; life or existence doesn't stop or disappear, but continues, on and on...For a four year old boy, this was an amazing realization.<br /><br />The author then proceeds chronologically through his life towards his discovery and later practice of the \\"black arts\\". He discovers the infamous Aleister Crowley, eventually joins the dwindling ranks of the OTO, and has never looked back. This is a fascinating journey of spiritual discovery, the achievement of humility, and the wish to use the \\"black arts\\" in the attainment of spiritual knowledge, and the will to help his fellow man.<br /><br />One of the most interesting stories was during his time in Takilma, meeting the intriguing French Canadian, Gary Dubois, a practicing pranic healer. Unfortunately, DuQuette steps on one of Dubois' kittens, breaking its back. In a scene similar to a Stephen King thriller, Dubois actually, through the application of pranic healing, brings the dead kitten back to life. After this event, not surprisingly, they call the cat Lazarus. Sound unbelievable? Read the story for yourself, and you just might change your mind.<br /><br />This biography is ultimately about DuQette's search for spiritual truth and the pitfalls, tragedies and triumphs along the way. The book also communicates the old adage that it's not wise to take oneself too seriously. DuQette certainly doesn't, though his words ring of spiritual insight.<br /><br />My Life with the Spirits was pleasure to read.o take oneself too seriously.

Hannibal Lecter, as far as fictional killers are concerned, has topped the charts, in terms of popularity. Lecter is unusually intelligent, cunning beyond words, and has aristocratic tastes, and a taste for human flesh. The old doctor kills when he's bored or annoyed. He disposed of the philharmonic's first-chair violinist, for example, because, he believed, the man played out of tune. In anyone's book, this killing was not justified, but justified enough for the ear-sensitive doctor. In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, we are given a unique perspective on a familiar theme: serial killer as avenging knight. Dexter knows he's an emotionless killer; he knows he's basically damaged goods because of a terrible event in his childhood; however, he has somehow managed to channel his fondness for murder towards those individuals who actually deserve it - child killers, etc. This is an interesting and unique twist for the genre, though Dexter loves his work, I mean, really loves it, which makes the whole concept a tad disturbing.<br /><br />For a first time novelist, this is a good effort, easy to read prose that pushes the reader along.<br /><br />Written in the first-person, we're permitted entry to Dexter's mind. We find that he has a dual personality, his social persona, the face he shows to the world, and the \\"dark passenger\\"; the famous Freudian \\"id\\", which drives him to commit these acts of \\"justice\\". The man appears to be in control of both personalities, until he begins dreaming about another serial killer's work. Another serial killer is on the loose in Miami, taunting Dexter, imitating his style, only he's much more efficient. Is it possible that Dexter is this new killer, performing these heinous acts in his sleep? Has it come down to the fact that \\"total control\\" Dexter is finally losing it?<br /><br />Jeff Lindsay has managed to make a serial killer a likable fellow - naive, self-deprecating and at times even funny.<br /><br />For pure entertainment, Dexter is good value.at times even funny.  <br /> <br />For pure entertainment, Dexter is good value. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-19

As Ravina ponders, why did finding Takamori's head matter: because it represented one of the oldest traditions of the warrior class. At the final battle between the rebel forces against the Meiji state on the morning of September 24, 1877, in which the rebel forces were defeated, by presenting the severed head of this legendary defeated warrior, it displayed honour, and offering the head to the lord as tribute, this showed great respect for the Samurai class as a whole. (This was a contradiction, as the Meniji state had been suppressing the Samurai tradition for some time) It was highly symbolic that Takamori's head could not be found, which the author exams with great erudition and depth.<br /><br />Saigo Takamori continues to be revered in Japan because he has come to represent the true Japan, medieval Japan, before the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate and the rise of the Meiji state, which ironically, Saigo Takamori played a major role that contributed to their rise and fall, respectively. Takamori was at once a great traditionalist and reformer. He practiced the old ways and believed passionately in the basic virtues of the Samurai, though at the same time realised the great need for his country to reform. In the end, he knew that Japan had to retain its cultural heritage, all that was good and positive, but he also realized the need to move with the west. He believed the west was advanced in many ways, politically, yet cultural anomalies such as ballroom dancing, he utterly appalled. In effect, he desired everything good from both cultures.<br /><br />In fact this entire story is a paradox. It is because the desire for reform and the desire to retain the traditional are equal in importance and strength. Interestingly, after Saigo's death, a slogan appeared in the popular press at the time: \\"Shinsei kotoku\\" (A New Government, Rich and Value), in other words, a new governing body that retains traditional values. As the author points out -<br /><br />\\"...it looks forward to a new government but harkens back to the notion that the state should be benevolent rather than bureaucratic. Implicit in the slogan was the contradictory but compelling desire for the vitality of a free society combined with the security of a Confucian patriarchy.\\" (P.206)<br /><br />The last Samurai, Sagio Takamori, is a mixture of legend and historical fact. Japan has created him as a symbol of modern Japan, that contradiction of modernity and deep-seated tradition that endures today. This is an excellent work on a fascinating individual.<br /><br />Highly recommended.peared in the popular press at the time: \\"Shinsei kotoku\\" (A New Government, Rich and Value), in other words, a new governing body that retains traditional values.

Along with these spiritual steps are practical exercises to help us develop in these areas. These seven principles are designed and intended by the author to awaken our souls, prompt us to live in the moment, and ultimately realize the deep connection between all things in the universe.<br /><br />One gets the impression that Michael Gleb has written this book directly from his heart. One senses a sincerity and clean desire to share everything he has discovered that has aided him in living a more meaningful existence. Intuitively I perceived a gut-level honesty in this book and a clear desire from the author to help his readers gain practical knowledge in order to live happier lives. Considering the vast amount of self-help manuals out there, all grappling for a piece of the self-improvement market, it was refreshing to read such an honest and well-written work. There is no question in my mind that Michael Gleb is sincere in his intention to share his seven principles, gently putting us on the road to living more meaningful lives.<br /><br />We all have our areas of strengths and weaknesses, aspects of our lives that need honing or at least an honest assessment. For me it is living in the moment, not letting life pass by without experiencing all its wonders. For many years each day would more or less be taken for granted, thoughts preoccupied with memories of the past or worries about the future. The chapter on sharpening awareness has pointed me in the right direction to enjoy the moment, live in the moment, and experience the wonders of being aware in present time. Gleb also advises us on one of the age-old tenets of philosophy, first announced by the Greek philosopher, Socrates, and that was to \\"know thy self\\". The unexamined life is not worth living is a datum to live by that Gleb emphasises more that any of the other principles. It is an important one.<br /><br />One does not have to read Michael Gleb's first book, \\"How to Think Like Leonardo Da Vince\\" in order to fully appreciate this one.

This is an interesting pamphlet of interviews by David Barsamian with Noam Chomsky, which covers a wide collection of topics from defective democracy, health care, religious fundamentalism, the CIA and the media.<br /><br />The central thrust of these interviews focuses on the corporatization of our democratic system. In one interview, Chomsky cites Thomas Jefferson's warning or fear, made at the end of his life, stating, that, the elites, aristocrats, \\"fear and distrust of the people, and wish to draw all powers from them into the hands of the higher classes.\\" Democrats on the other hand, \\"identify with the people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider them as the most honest and safe, although not the most wise, depository of the public interest.\\" What Jefferson was saying is that the people should have the reigns of power; we should be in control, and not the centralized, powerful elites. Jefferson's greatest fear was the \\"banking institutions and monied incorporations\\" (big business) and if they were allowed to influence politics, they would eventually run the entire show, benefiting the few at the exclusion of the majority. It is here, throughout this text, that Chomsky offers several examples how corporate America and big business internationally, influence our democratic system where, economically the \\"little guy' suffers while big business gets bigger as our basic wages plummet. In other terms, the rich get richer, the gap between rich and poor widens and only the few benefit.<br /><br />One has only to look at the statistical indicators of countries around the world, comparing rich and poor sovereign states to see that nothing is changing for the better in developing countries but steadily getting worse, while the small percentage of rich countries, ironically exploiting these poorer countries, are improving their wealth. The gap is widening, particularly over the past thirty years, doubling the wealth in the top twenty percent, while the low twenty percent has become much poorer. These statistics speak for themselves, and there are reasons for this dramatic shift in wealth.<br /><br />Politicians' incestuous connection to the corporate sector is well documented. Tax breaks for the rich, while the man or woman on basic wages supporting a family can pay, in some cases, more tax than a CEO. Our politicians for the obvious reasons protect the corporate sector: campaign contributions, personal investment, etc. Jefferson's fear and warning in the early 19th century against banking institutions and monied corporations involvement in politics has been realized.<br /><br />Chomsky, in most cases, backs his arguments with statistical data and historical documentation that can be researched and checked by any interested individual. His words are never rhetorical, ad hominem arguments or self-righteous condemnations to push a personal agenda. He speaks about fact, revealing injustice and at times crimes against the common citizen that should not be ignored.

One wrong decision, a stupid action, something spoken out loud on impulse, can bring the wrath of fate tumbling upon you. But the question must be asked, when fate decides to throw a curve ball in your direction, do you face and suffer the consequences, or run and hide, begin a new life and hope against hope that you'll not be found out? This is the basic theme in Kennedy's renowned novel, The Big Picture.<br /><br />Ben Bradford apparently has it all - a partnership in a distinguished Manhattan law firm, a beautiful house in Connecticut, a pretty wife and two small children. He has enough money to spend without any thought about budgeting. As a wannabe photographer, he has a state of the art dark room in his house, over forty thousand dollars worth of camera equipment and the time to pursue this hobby. Despite seemingly having it all, Mr. Bradford is dreadfully unhappy. The relationship with his beautiful wife is on tenterhooks at best, as they haven't slept together for over a year. He suspects she is having an affair, and his suspicions turn out to be true. The actions he takes in response to this infidelity have dire consequences. Ben's life changes forever, but where does it lead, and can he live with himself and achieve some modicum of happiness?<br /><br />The Bid Picture is one of the most original thrillers to come out in years. The reading experience will have your palms in a sweat and your heart racing from the beginning. In spite of the protagonist's actions, Kennedy ensures we have great empathy for the character. We want him to get away with it, but will he get away with it and for what price?<br /><br />For me this book was a pleasurable surprise, as I would have never picked it up unless it was recommended to me. If you want a completely enthralling read that is guaranteed to keep you reading into the dead of night, read The Big Picture - a class act in every way.. <br /> <br />	2004-09-25

He's living the Manhattan dream: high fliers, exclusive restaurants, a downtown apartment and a beautiful wife. Ned is also a nice guy, generally an ethical man, which is a dangerous thing to be in a world of the \\"cut throat\\" deal. One could say that life is a series of choices, and the choice we make determine who we are in the end. Ned wants to do the right thing, he cares about his employees, but sometimes the pressures of the deal, and the stress of the moment can push one to make decisions that can turn one's life upside down. Ned is confronted with an ethical dilemma - he makes a decision, moving into that ethical `grey' area, that sets off a chain of circumstances which changes his ideal Manhattan life into a nightmare.<br /><br />Kennedy ensures we have great sympathy for Ned Allen. The mistakes he makes, his dubious ethical choices, most would agree are minor compared to some of the stories we hear about in the world of big business and high finance. But for some people it doesn't take much to topple our house of cards on simply a whim or seemingly insignificant choice. While some get away with murder or move through life stepping on people on a daily basis without a second thought of consequences, some of us can make one little mistake, and the world changes forever. Ned is that type of person that must follow his own values or pay the price.

In this short though thorough essay, the novelist reflects on the many arguments surrounding the death penalty. In March 2000, a Moratorium on executions was declared by the then Governor of Illinois, George Ryan. Turow, along with many distinguished lawyers and academics, after two years of deliberation, submitted their recommendations. As a result of these findings, Ryan made international news by commuting the sentences of 167 persons left on death row. (This made headline news in Australia as the death penalty here was abolished over forty years ago) It should go without saying that this was a bold move by the Governor and potential political suicide. However he was at the end of his tenure and decided to make a choice and act on that choice. This book summarizes the many aspects of the Moratorium's deliberations, which makes fascinating reading.<br /><br />Before the Moratorium, Turow admits that he was a \\"Death Penalty Agnostic\\". In other words, the man was a fence sitter, refusing to make a stand either way. However, after two years on the committee, and by the end of the essay, if asked whether Illinois should retain Capital Punishment, his answer is a certain, no. After reading the many reasons for and against the debate, I found it understandable why he fell off the fence. That the system is fallible and the fact that, for the most part, we seem to be hard wired for revenge, it has been all too easy, in our zealousness for justice or retribution, to execute innocent people. This has occurred far too many times for any government to be comfortable executing its citizens. But of course, as Turow plainly points out, this issue is a complex one, which begs to be further unpacked, potently analysed, in order to make it law, either way, across the boards.<br /><br />From my reading, the actual recommendations from the committee are reasonable and fair. For example, ensuring the videotaping of all questioning of a capital suspect conducted on a police facility; that the eligibility criteria for the death penalty is narrowed to five points; that the death penalty is not available when a conviction is based only on the testimony of a single eyewitness. (p. 122) The Moratorium did not want the death penalty abolished entirely, however, these recommendations are designed to ensure an innocent defendant stands a lesser chance of wrongful execution.<br /><br />Turow writes great novels about the law. In this case, he has approached a subject that absolutely requires further debate. And he has done it with honesty and enthusiasm with a novelist's flair and elegance. Good reading.ble and fair.

There is nothing new under the sun, and stories, narratives, are simply variations of similar themes recorded throughout the ages. This is one theory. When reading modern fiction, however, it is difficult for some readers not to make associations to other stories, other tales. This habit can ruin the spectacle and enjoyment of the reading experience. It is better to decide there and then before embarking on the story to consciously suspend our disbelief, our propensity to analyze, and merely sit back and be entertained. When sitting down to read Koontzs' latest, this was exactly my intention. But the further into the tale I traveled, the more associations were made, particularly to one of the greatest stories ever told, The New Testament. More particularly, in this case, the last book, written by St John the Divine, Revelations. At the risk of over interpretation, one could propose that \\"The Taking\\" is a modern thriller version of Revelations, as the many references to this book concerning the final days of existence, are numerous and many, without any effort from the author to conceal these associations.<br /><br />Many critics have argued that this book is rife with over-written prose, unnecessary use of adverbs and adjectives, and complicated sentence structure, when a simpler style, Koontze familiar style, would have sufficed. In some cases this is true, because in many ways, it detracted from the reading experience. However, to my mind, this is a minor quibble. All said and done, The Taking is a good novel, an entertaining novel, as it had me literally enthralled, whipping through page after page, to reach its conclusion in one rainy afternoon.<br /><br />Koontze gift for characterization is lacking in this novel as it is primarily plot driven. This is another shift from his usual fare. In his last two novels, both wonderful stories, Odd Thomas and The Face, were essentially character driven, and excellent examples of this style. The only two characters in this novel that had any depth at all were, of course, Molly, the protagonist, and interestingly the dog, Virgil. In many respects Virgil is the true hero of this tale.<br /><br />I would have to agree with many that The Taking is not one of Koontz' best literary endeavors, though its creative spin on Armageddon, and its references to Revelations, makes it certainly a novel worth reading.llent examples of this style.

He is known in some circles as the \\"tortured genius\\" as his life was a passionate and agonizing battle to be true to his nature and to discover `real' philosophy with the intent of putting an end to the subject all together. Some believed he achieved this end - the man certainly re-directed philosophical enquiry in our modern times. The problem with most of us lesser creatures, understanding Wittgenstein's thought and work is a momentous task. If you have had the pleasure or tormenting experience of reading or studying his Tractatus Logico-philosophicus or Philosophical Investigations, or one or two of the literarily thousands of commentaries and secondary sources on his work, you will comprehend or at least relate to the complexity of his thought. The Duty of Genius is a great philosophical biography because the author has managed to elegantly connect Wittgenstein the man, his spiritual concerns and emotional preoccupations, with his philosophy, in one flowing, well-written narrative. I came away from this book with greater insight into analytical philosophy and a deep appreciation of the man himself.<br /><br />Wittgenstein was one of the most opinionated men I have ever read about. In fact he had an opinion on just about everything, particularly music. He believed that no other music after Brahms was worth listening to and Mozart and Beethoven are the true \\"son's of God\\". He loved reading American detective stories and believed our so-called modern age is a dark age in all respects. Similar to a good pragmatist, he believed that knowledge and doing, action, were intimately connected. He had a privileged up bringing in pre WW1 Vienna, a fascinating, tumultuous and highly creative period before the fall of the Austrian Hungarian Empire. He was a neighbour of Sigmund Freud and went to the same Primary school as Adolph Hitler. (Both remembered each other later in life during WW2.) He inherited a large fortune and ended up giving most of it away. He wrote his first major work, The Tractatus, while a prisoner of war in Italy. All of these things are wonderfully described in the biography, but Monk has managed to convey something about the man that is hard to define, and that was his magnetic personality. Wittgenstein's magical presence is legendary and the numerous anecdotes described by Monk, I believe, truly gives the reader a vivid sense of this presence, his genius comes through loud and clear in this book. And this is what makes this biography so moving and interesting.<br /><br />This biography will not give the reader a full comprehension of Wittgenstein's philosophy, however, as an introduction, putting the man and his work into their proper historical context, the clouds begin to dissipate and a glimmer of understanding begins to appear - extremely engaging, informative, well-written and entertaining.Both remembered each other later in life during WW2.)

This second edition of Brabazon's incredible biography contains new material regarding the relationship between Schweitzer and his wife, Helene, due to the discovery of numerous letters between them. The author also adds material in the later chapters, focusing on the antagonism that erupted between the United States government and the old doctor, as Schweitzer and other activists, such as Albert Einstein and philosopher, Bertrand Russell, exposed to the public at large the fall-out hazards of the hydrogen bomb testing that the government wanted to keep secret, as the Cold War was then in full swing. This new material is rich in insight, revealing that Albert Schweitzer the myth, the modern saint, \\"The Greatest Man in the World\\", was indeed human, and whose long and arduous work in West Africa, paved the way, or at least set an example for present day and future humanitarians.<br /><br />What is most striking about this man was his incredible capacity for work. He held Doctorates in three major subjects - theology, philosophy and medicine and was an accomplished organist and world expert on Bach. Schweitzer's published works in theology, philosophy and music remain in circulation, which continue to shed light in these areas. His \\"Reverence for Life\\" philosophy on the surface, appears almost too simplistic, but on closer examination, is a worldview that encompasses an attitude of mind, that if practiced, could radically change the world for the better. Schweitzer was not a philosopher of the abstract variety, at home in an ivory tower creating complex theories that only a select few would understand. As the man said and wrote many times, \\"he lived his argument\\" and his accomplishments certainly prove this.<br /><br />Brabazon's biography of this great man is thorough. He delightfully brings together Schweitzer's letters, books, articles, and interviews with friends, colleagues and family, including sermons from his early career as a young minister, that tells us that his love of Jesus and the foundations of his philosophy was already set in his mind and spirit, well before embarking into his long and productive life. Brabazon brings Schweitzer to life in these pages as only a great biographer wholly connected to their subject can do. It is extremely well written and engaging.<br /><br />If you are only slightly interested in one of the great humanitarians of the twentieth century, an intellectual, a man of God, Samaritan, healer and example of goodness, read this engrossing biography - a labor of love and inspiring in every sense.esus and the foundations of his philosophy was already set in his mind and spirit, well before embarking into his long and productive life.

Casanova has been hailed as the greatest lover of the 18th century and has become the first person we think of in the ways of seduction. He is the quintessential ladies man for some, and for others, a manipulative scoundrel, an expert at self-promotion, and at worse, a spinner of colourful tails. In fact he is all these things and much more. On top of his many amorous affairs with not only servants and chambermaids but also ladies of nobility, he is a compelling storyteller, a gentleman of taste, a violinist, theologian, philosopher and a gifted courtier. There has been so much written about the man, that I felt compelled to read about his life from his own words. Casanova is the most notorious seducer of women in history, and if you read The Story of My Life, you will understand an aspect of this man that is all too often over looked, and that is, he more often than not loved the women he seduced, and in some cases, remained in love with them for the rest of his relatively long life. In other words, he cared about women, respected them, idolized them and ensured that the pleasures they gained from these liaisons, exceeded his. He used women but he also loved them.<br /><br />  The book is written in a flowing style, descriptive to the point where the reader gains almost a visceral impression of 18th century Europe. Casanova's escape from the Venetian prison, for example, has all the suspense and realism of our modern thrillers. I could almost hear his finger nails scraping against the prison walls as he descended, sliding down in the dead of night during his escape. In his meeting with Voltaire, the gnome-like genius came to life, as they discussed the state of literature and the greatest poets of the ages. And, of course, the many beautiful women, his conquests and those that seduced him, fill every chapter - tasteful eroticism without the slightest hint of vulgarity. Casanova was an adventurer in love and life and he ensured he did not waste a minute of it.<br /><br />  Casanova wanted to be remembered as a man of letters, in the 18th century sense of this term. And with The Story of My Life, he certainly achieved this aim, as scholars from around the world have acknowledged. He also wanted to be remembered as a man who loved women, and to this end, there is no question. Those that love intrigue, eroticism, a little pomp and circumstance, and swashbuckling adventure, read this incredible memoir - a pleasure in every sense.sanova wanted to be remembered as a man of letters, in the 18th century sense of this term.

Personally, years ago, the first time I read about \\"The Donald\\", there was something about him that I really liked - I couldn't actually put my finger on exactly what it was, but there was an instant admiration, and a clear, instinctive impression that he was straight forward, honest and tremendously hard working. A true American character.<br />Through the media we watched his well-publicised divorce from Ivana, and his near bankruptcy in the realm of 9.2 billion dollars. At that time, particularly here in Australia, we had our own 80's millionaires fall from grace, and the public at large loved every minute of it. As a society, we love to see the mighty fall; it seems to be in our natures. But unlike some of our fallen entrepreneurs, The Donald came back and came back with a vengeance, which was an astonishing feat, and for me, very inspiring. Unlike some of my friends and family, I enjoy watching the reality television show, The Apprentice - its value lies in its believable portrayal of  the business world and the skill and personality required to survive in that world. This is what prompted me to read Trump's latest memoir, and without reservation, I was thoroughly impressed.<br />The book is organized in six parts: Business and Management, Career Advice, Money, The Secrets of Negotiation, The Trump Lifestyle and Inside the Apprentice. One can glean from these pages a wealth of advice to achieve success and potential wealth. This advice is from a man who has succeeded many times over, rising from the ashes of defeat like the proverbial phoenix. The writing style is breezy and chatty, as if you were sitting in front of the man in his office. Some of his anecdotes are entertaining to the point where I actually laughed out loud. My favourite chapter would have to be, A Week in the Life, written in a diary format hour by hour through a five-day week. From this one gets a true picture of the man's immense energy level and genuine passion for what he does every day. In fact I was a little exhausted after finishing the chapter and amazed at his capacity for work. And this is the secret: dogged hard work, attention to detail and grasping the big picture. I believe he would be a hard man to work for because he's such a perfectionist, but the experience would be well worth the time and potential anguish.<br />Because the writing is simple and flowing, the book can be properly read in a few hours. His advice is practical and can be applied immediately. Reading How to get Rich was absolutely an afternoon well spent. Highly recommended.n fact I was a little exhausted after finishing the chapter and amazed at his capacity for work.

In our world of political correctness and appearances, where society is depicted as fair, democratic, at times altruistic and transparent, the reality of the situation is far different. And as Greene proposes, no one wants to be seen as power hungry, and those that do, are generally scorned. Power is a game. And to play this game successfully, duplicity is the key: to win power, we must, on the surface, at least appear to be fair, altruistic and transparent, however we must scheme, manipulate, deceive, charm and seduce, if we are to get what we want...to achieve power, as Napoleon suggested, we should use an iron fist with a velvet glove, smiling as we stab our opponents in the back. Attaining power is war, though according to Greene, a civilized war.<br />Any person with an essential good nature should find this book a little disturbing. The message from Greene is clear - living the virtuous life is the road to failure and powerlessness. Appealing to the better angels of our natures is a lost cause and will get us nowhere but the bottom of the food chain. In other words, &quot;nice guys finish last.&quot; The only way to the top is through treachery, seduction, observing others' weaknesses to then play on those weaknesses to your advantage. Greene's advice is basically a negative strategy to power and success. And to be sure, there are other positive strategies out there to attain power and success without resorting to deception and covert manipulation. But none are presented here.<br />That said, understanding the 48 laws presented here, at least will make us aware of the depths some people will go to in order to get what they desire. In this regard, this text is worth the time, energy and money.	2004-07-04

It should be stated from the start that, in all respects, Mr. Clark is not some whimpering liberal or political opportunist. If anything, as a thirty-year veteran in Washington, having worked for three presidents, both democratic and republican, and leader of the CSG, which planned and executed several successful military missions against terrorism, this man is no doubt a patriot and a deeply concerned citizen. And his concerns lie mainly in the Bush administrations lack of effective action against America's number one enemy, al Qaeda.<br />As is now common knowledge, the Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz triad with Bush at the helm, allegedly had Iraq and Hussein in their sights even before entering office in 2000. A proposed reason for this senseless war was not only to fight terrorism, but to fulfil some personal vendetta, and further oil rights and power in the region. As Clark makes perfectly clear, this war will not assuage Islamic fundamentalism and their jihads against the western world. In fact the invasion of Iraq, as the evidence in this book convincingly points out, will only add fuel to the fire, accomplishing nothing in terms of peace in the Middle East and the war against terrorism.<br />Rather than effectively beef up domestic security to prevent and deal with future terrorist attacks, it is proposed that this administration has created confusion and further distrust of the government with their ironically named `Patriot Act' and half-hearted home security policies. Rather than unite the countries of the world to effectively fight terror, this administration has further estranged the Islamic world communities and has alienated the U.S.' long term allies and chose to invade Iraq, costing many lives, that sadly will not halt al Qaeda or world terrorism in the least.<br />Clark gives a controversial, compelling and valid perspective of three administrations and their dealings with world terrorism. He illustrates a detailed history of terrorist activities and the actual creation of al Queda. The narrative style of the first person only adds to the texts accessibility and engagement. A must read for all concerned citizens.the actual creation of al Queda. The narrative style of the first person only adds to the texts accessibility and engagement.

Is there a formula for living that will pave the way to ultimate success and general happiness? In all reality, there is not one simple formula to attain success and happiness, but there are methods in which, if honestly applied, can change one's conditions for the better.<br />Modelling one's life after a great person, whether alive or dead, is one of the basic methods towards living a better life. In fact, one will find most &quot;self help&quot; manuals prescribe just such a method. Find someone who is being, doing and having what you want to achieve, and then emulate that individual, and your chances of success can almost be assured.  Leonardo Da Vinci is more than likely one of the most famous geniuses in history. When one thinks of the quintessential Renaissance man, Da Vinci comes to mind without question. What Michael Gleb has done in this inspiring book, is gleen the maestro's notebooks, various biographies, and his paintings, and has developed a well though-out system to live life as it should be lived, as an art form.<br />The book is well organized: firstly an Introduction, describing the history of the Renaissance, providing a context for the reader in which Leonardo worked, created and lived. Following from there, Gleb then illustrates seven principles in which he believes Da Vinci lived and applied throughout his life. These principles are very practical and if the reader follows the many exercises at the end of each chapter, however slight, a positive change in one's view of the world should occur.<br />It is well known that one can only change conditions in life, if there is a personal willingness and commitment to do so. Most of us desire to live fuller lives and to change conditions for the better in one area or another. With an open mind, a strong desire to live life as if it was an art form and experience the depths of existence in all its mystery, beauty and wonder, this little book may just present the right formulas to do so.

The biographies about old Ben Franklin, both juvenile and scholarly, would fill several bookshelves. He was a renaissance man in the truest sense of this term, as well as the quintessential man of the Enlightenment. What struck me about this particular biography was his approach to life - a curiosity that knew no bounds, and a sly, ironic wit - a man who did not take himself too seriously. Apart from his many scientific discoveries, he was a diplomat of great skill. In fact, if it weren't for Mr. Franklin, the American Revolution would have taken a different turn. He walked the halls of French power, networking, prodding, submerging himself amongst the French power brokers, creating alliances that changed the course of history: a courtier of the first order. He was also a ladies man, conducting deep though platonic relationships with the ladies of the French court. In many cases, these ladies of the court held the reigns of power, and knowing them furthered the American cause. Franklin was a complicated man, as geniuses can be, and this biography explores some of these contradictions of character, though in a way that is accessible for young readers and Franklin scholars. In other words, this is a highly entertaining biography for all readers interested in the life of this American legend.<br />This biography is highly accessible because Isaacson is a talented writer; he combines the scholarly approach with a journalistic flair, presenting the facts of the subject in an entertaining form. Reading this book was an effortless experience; the pages seemed to turn themselves, as if the book was being read to me rather than actually reading it. This was a unique experience, which shows that Isaacson is at the top of his game.<br />There have been many books written about this great man, but this one appears to be unique because its content is informative and its style, accessible and highly entertaining.

This is an essential lexicon for the numerous symbols and cultural icons that have appeared or have their origins mainly in the western tradition. After reading the many definitions, it dawned on me that many symbols are simply misunderstood by popular culture and used in the wrong context. This text also takes the meaning of certain symbols and traces their root derivations, showing that meaning changes as the culture changes; and that different cultures use the same icon or symbol for entirely different purposes. Because our world is rife with signifiers, it would be a daunting task indeed to provide a comprehensive collection. Though what Biedermann has done is capture those symbols and icons that he believes have been the most significant throughout western civilization.<br />A good example of a symbol that has been appropriated is the swastika. Anyone seeing this symbol in present time will associate it with Adolf Hitler's Nazi party. However this symbol has it roots from a pre-Aryan civilization, Mohenjo-Daro, circa 2000 B.C., in ancient China. It was also seen in old Buddhist traditions and certain Gnostic sects in late antiquity.<br />This important text would be invaluable in any researcher's library as it contains nearly 600 entries and over 2000 symbols.

When picking up his latest, my intention was to savour the experience, only read a little at a time, maybe a few chapters before bed, so that that the pleasure would extend, lasting a long time. This did not happen. In fact, this text was completed in one sitting. After turning the last page, the story left me satisfied, though, wondering when Connelly would release his next one. This type of behaviour may sound a little on the neurotic side, but Connelly's stories are simply that good. I've come to have high expectations about his work, and thus far, have not been disappointed. The Narrows is an excellent piece of crime writing.<br />Those of you familiar with Harry Bosch from Lost Light, Connelly's last novel, and many others, will find the character hasn't changed. Harry remains that sombre, fatalistic and determined individual. He's a cold realist without the cynicism. This character has a strong sense of his purpose in life, which he calls his mission, and the ability to stare evil directly in the eye without flinching. Bosch is a no nonsense type of guy, who manages to see that shred of goodness in the world, where others only see darkness. Harry is a good man. In a world filled with superheroes, fictional characters that are way over the top, here we have a hero in a rumpled suit, a man who knows himself, with a strong sense of his function in the world. He will get the job done no matter what happens, and without actually coming out and saying it, he would gladly lay down his life if it meant saving yours.<br />The Narrows is a sequel to Connelly's fifth novel, The Poet. The killer is ex FBI, a sadistic murderer that was dubbed The Poet because he would leave clues that could be traced back to the poems and writings of the master of the macabre, Edgar Allen Poe. Special Agent Rachel Walling, in the first novel, shot the killer through a window, and all hoped he was dead. But now he's resurfaced with a new agenda. Through investigating the suspicious death of an old friend, Terry McCaleb, (the famous protagonist from the novel and film, Blood Work) Bosch uncovers a connection to the poet; the investigation takes him to the deserts of Nevada, where the bodies of several men have been uncovered.

US	45814424	RPEZFY9FUX7W8	0743204735	660154931	Bush at War	Books	4	9	9	N	N	The forgotten war...	Woodward is an international media legend. The cause of his world renown was, of course, unearthing the Watergate scandal, leading to the eventual resignation of a president. Because of his long tenure at the Washington Post and reputation as a `pure' reporter, we expect great things from this man; at least reporting the facts in a bipartisan fashion. In Bush at War, he focuses on the Bush administrations response to 9/11 in the form of the invasion of Afghanistan, as many have deemed the \\"forgotten war\\". Woodward reveals an administration, at times, hysterically grasping at a way to attain some kind of retribution for 9/11. A war cabinet at odds with each other, all seeming to have their own agendas, and in the end, after Afghanistan was supposedly won; only a few al Qaeda terrorists were captured, (16 of the top 22 leaders were still at large, and the arch enemy, bin Laden, well hidden and laughing at us from his secret hideaway) though the oppressive Taliban was disbanded, ironically and sadly, Afghanistan still remains a potential haven for al Qaeda terrorists.<br />One should not include this text as just another `Bush bashing' exercise, because the president is depicted as a passionate and determined leader, albeit inexperienced, hell-bent on bringing those responsible for 9'11 to justice. Woodward skilfully puts the reader in the shoes of the president, and we feel his anger, frustration and one-eyed goal for retribution. The president's cabinet, however, are depicted as mostly floundering during the crises, fighting with one another, vying for power, in the pursuit of their own particular goals. The vice president is a crafty fellow, a smiling political assassin, so to speak, while Rumsfield is depicted as your basic playground bully. There is a scene in the book where Rumsfield pokes his finger with force into Woodward's chest during an interview, pushing the reporter off balance - this action speaks worlds. As an administrator, Rumsfield is meticulous, arrogant and definitely not a team player, (my way or no way) and, to my mind, holds the majority of responsibility for the current mess in Afghanistan and the present \\"quagmire\\" situation we now have in Iraq. Technically, the buck stops with the president, though Rumsfield has a lot to answer for...<br />Although not emphatically stated, Bush at War begs the question: did Afghanistan accomplish anything in terms of combating terrorism? Is the world a safer place as a result of many lives lost and literarily millions of dollars spent on bribing the Afghani Northern Alliance?  Well, the answer is in the results - and they speak for themselves.<br />Woodward's book is by no means a revelation about this administration. One has only to look out the window, turn on the television or open a newspaper, to see where this administration is leading us. However I recommend this text as a close as possible `true' historical record of the Afghanistan `incursion', and how the military machine operates in war conditions.ogant and definitely not a team player, (my way or no way) and, to my mind, holds the majority of responsibility for the current mess in Afghanistan and the present \\"quagmire\\" situation we now have in Iraq.

Since the discovery of The Gospel of Mary in the late nineteenth century in Egypt and the Nag Hammadi texts in 1947, the figure of Mary Magdalene has gained prominence in religious scholarly circles as well as popular culture.<br />The first to bring Mary Magdalene to a wider audience was Elaine Pagels' groundbreaking text, The Gnostic Gospels. Though, interestingly, it was the popular thriller by Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code, that really caught the imagination of a wide readership, sparking many texts, both scholarly and otherwise, to be published.<br />Marvin Meyer, editor of the Gospel of Thomas, has written and compiled in this text a selection of extracanonical literature, including the New Testament Gospels, revealing the central role of Mary Magdalene in the formation and history of Christianity. However, Meyer points out, that, The New Testament obscured the importance of Magdalene's role through the interest of the author's who...\\"advanced the cause of the male disciples (especially the Twelve) and the place of Peter.\\" (iiv) There is no doubt that Mary Magdalene, after reading this brief though informative selection of texts, was the beloved disciple to Jesus, and for many reasons, culturally, politically or otherwise, her importance was suppressed, and only now, over two thousand years after the birth of Christianity, has her central role as apostle and teacher, is gaining prominence once again.<br />Meyer's has compiled a selection of Christian literature, including segments of the New Testament, Mark, Matthew, Luke and John, The Gospel of Mary, Thomas, Phillip, The Dialogue of the Savoir, excerpts from the Gnostic text, Pistis Sophia and segments from The Manichaean Psalms of Heracleides, that all mention Mary Magdalene in one context or another, emphasising her close relationship with Jesus and her pivotal role in Christs crucifixion and resurrection.<br />Close examination of the numerous non-canonical texts along with the New Testament, to my mind, will only strengthen one's belief and spiritual insights into the divine. There are many reasons why the figure of Mary Magdalene has been marginalized from the \\"official\\" church, however, her emergence as the beloved companion to Jesus in our modern times from the \\"shadows of history\\", can only nurture our spiritual natures, guiding us on our personal journeys.<br />This book is a short though quality addition to Christian literary scholarship.will only strengthen one's belief and spiritual insights into the divine.

What makes conspiracy theories compelling is that they provide meaning to things and events, usually terrible events, giving us something or someone to blame. What gives most conspiracy theories credence is that they do, in some cases, hold some modicum of truth. However compelling these theories may be, there seems always to be one piece of the puzzle missing, one illogical leap of faith, and the argument falls into a thousand pieces.<br />In this interesting text, conspiracy investigator extraordinaire, Michael Hoffman, has his enemy targeted, and it is their power/occult driven machinations behind the scenes, that has contributed to the rapid decline of western civilization, as we know it. And he calls this enemy the \\"Neo-Platonic, Gnostic-Hermetic, Kabbalistic-Rosicrucian-Masonic-Cryptocracy who, since the renaissance, have been hell bent on turning the planet into a materialistic centred, somnambulistic, soulless wasteland. And these so-called elites have infiltrated every influential aspect of our culture, from governments, churches to the medical profession and advertising. As far as Hoffman is concerned, we are being manipulated on a grand scale, and these elites have done so well, at this stage of the game, the mind control being so extensive and pervasive, we're aware of being manipulated, but are simply do apathetic to do anything about it.<br />This is not the place to analyse all Hoffman's propositions and theories, pick them apart, and reveal some pretty extensive flaws in his thinking; however the greatest flaw being the fact that by definition, a secret society is just that, secret. He targets the Freemasons, OTO, Gnosticism, Scientology, Rosicrucians et al. A few of these organizations have had to be secret at some point in time in their respective histories because of oppressive prosecution, but exist in present time in an open democratic society. It is their actions, or \\"secret\\" actions that have Hoffman all tied up in knots. Although it's the way he goes about connecting the dots, so to speak, that is extremely compelling.<br />If anything, Hoffman's writing persuades us to think outside the circle. His writing pushes us to transcend the prosaic reasons given to us from so-called authorities, and seek the truth. Government actions, particularly, are always shrouded in PR rhetoric, and it is surprising that so many people believe the spin-doctors.  But wasn't it Freud who said that most people prefer illusion to the truth because illusion is much easier to live and deal with...perhaps.<br />Hoffman should be taken with a grain of salt, though his thought processes are intriguing and well worth the ride.he goes about connecting the dots, so to speak, that is extremely compelling.<br />If anything, Hoffman's writing persuades us to think outside the circle.

Considered by 19th century critics to be one of Dickens' more artistic and literary triumphs, Hard Times can be viewed in present time as a blistering polemic against the rise of industrial society and the dominate philosophy that rose in tandem with the industrial age, utilitarianism<br />It is well known that Dickens was a chronicler of his times, and his mode of expression, the novel. An intensely emotional individual, Dickens was known to be a power walker, starting in the afternoon, covering miles, to return home just before sunrise. It was during these extensive walks that he witnessed the utter poverty and squalor scattered throughout the streets of London. These walks brought inspiration for many of his novels, particularly, Hard Times.<br />In this novel, Dickens explores the applications of utilitarianism in its highly rational, and in many ways, brutal forms. The novels general theme is that a philosophy that is only concerned with happiness and survival for the majority, will attempt to quash any and all individual thought and effort. Individual ideas, emotion, imagination and creativity must be ruthlessly rejected in order for the majority of people to think alike, work alike and behave alike to attain a status quo of happiness for all. Rationality must prevail because imagination promotes individuality, which is anathema to mob concerns.<br />This polemic against utilitarianism is expressed clearly and persuasively in the practice of education. In the opening chapter for example, `The One Thing Needful\\", the reader is introduced to this dictatorial emphasis on the rational:<br />\\"Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will be of any service to them.\\" (p. 47)<br />Romanticism was now on the wane and utilitarianism and the rise of rationalism infiltrated every aspect of 19th century industrial life - emotion has no place in capitalism - the masses are reduced to statistics.<br />Dickens main point in writing Hard Times, I believe, was to illustrate the brutality of the applications of the philosophy, utilitarianism, and the destructive results it entails when humaneness, the vital aspect of our nature, is ignored completely. Dickens was reporting, and speaking against a potentially destructive sway in society away from basic humanity and the importance of the individual, towards the highly mechanical and rational `mob' philosophy of Utilitarianism during the Industrial revolution.<br />In our so-called modern times, Dickens message continues to be relevant. Our societies emphasis on rationalism and the exclusion of emotion, can only lead to destruction. A balance must be found.of 19th century industrial life - emotion has no place in capitalism - the masses are reduced to statistics. <br />Dickens main point in writing Hard Times, I believe, was to illustrate the brutality of the applications of the philosophy, utilitarianism, and the destructive results it entails when humaneness, the vital aspect of our nature, is ignored completely.

The Poet is a thoroughly impressive and credible piece of crime writing.<br />Jack McEvoy is a crime journalist for the Rocky Mountain News. He's seen death in its many forms and has become used to it because as his job demands, he lives and writes about it everyday. His secret is maintaining an arms- length- distance from the victim and the victim's family, until one day he's told about his twin brother's alleged suicide. As an experienced journalist, he has learned to ask the right questions, and can see an anomaly a mile a way at a dead run. Something is wrong about this particular suicide. And as he probes further, the inconsistencies mount up to such an extent, that it can only be one thing - murder. These anomalies lead to a chain of other murders around the country, all cop suicides - a serial killer is on the rampage, and he's been dubbed The Poet, because he leaves clues that can be traced back to the poems and writings of the master of the macabre, Edgar Allan Poe. Thus begins a well-crafted, attention to detail, suspenseful thriller from one of the best in the business, Michael Connelly.<br />This novel is a wonderful piece of story telling because of its realism and attention to detail. We become part of the narrator's mind, hearing what he hears, seeing what he sees, and feeling his thoughts and emotions. Jack McEvoy, to quote a clich&eacute;, comes to life on these pages, wholly absorbing, grabbing the reader by the scruff of the neck, and throwing them unmercifully into the tale. I am not exaggerating, as this story had me by the short one's from the first page to the last.<br />Connolly's writing is thorough yet sparse, elegant though matter of fact. He knows how to write a crime thriller, making it real, and able to scare the pants off you at the same time. It follows a formula but it doesn't read like one. I guess that's the key for a great writer in this genre - they follow all the required rules yet make the act transparent. We get the required twist at the end but Connolly twists it again just to make sure he's got us where he wants us to be. There's a lot to this book other than the obvious, and that also makes it a great read.<br />I found this book deeply satisfying as a fan of crime fiction. Excellent.at the end but Connolly twists it again just to make sure he's got us where he wants us to be.

In the hands of a man or woman at the top of their craft, a writer of immense skill and transparency, the experience for the reader can border on the pathological. Honesty without the slightest hint of pretence, particularly from an experienced and intelligent individual, knowing full well that what they tell the world is deeply personal and the honest to goodness truth, is rare. There's always some other agenda. For example, the two most famous confessional pieces in world literature are St. Augustine's Confessions and Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Confessions; both author's had an agenda in writing these works, whether for purposes of religious conversion or literary immortality - both achieved their respective ends. Brown's book, however, is different. This is a writer telling a story because this particular story needed to be told. I get the impression that Brown needed to communicate his life in the only form he knew how to as a writer. This is a memoir about writing, addiction, alcoholism, relationships and human responsibility. It is about madness, suicide, compulsion, irony and love. This is a heartbreaking story that leaves the reader with a tiny glimmer of hope. As a true confessional does, it doesn't raise feelings of sympathy or thoughts of self-righteous condescension, but a real empathy, because we've all experienced, in varying degrees, this man's life.<br />Brown's vivid and deceptively rendered prose reminds me of a style of American writing that's all its own. One reads this simple, clear-eyed style of writing and thinks that it would be easy to imitate. Wrong. It appears simple but is awfully difficult to do. Brown's prose adds to the subject matter, making his family obsessions and chemical escapes much harsher, difficult to swallow, but in the end, inspiring and troubling.<br />The L.A. Diaries is a rare memoir because it is what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything else.

As a child there was a word of advice that was given to me that was said would enable me to traverse through any social class from its awesome heights to its darkest depths, and that was, \\"Manners maketh the man. A gentleman is defined as one who has basic good manners\\". If one genuinely respects the rights of others, is sensitive, and occasionally does a `good turn' for someone, offering the appropriate \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" when required, one is able to walk quite comfortably with kings and paupers. More often than not, though, basic good manners will get you far, but sometimes it's the little things, those tacit social codes in particular situations that one is unaware of that can make one feel awkward and ungentlemanly. But that's life.<br />The Modern Gentleman is essentially a guidebook about the very basics and a particular lifestyle - the authors. The vast majority of advice given in this book is vital `common sense', most of the guidance is tongue and cheek, delivered with advertising copy wit, word play and a glut of clich&eacute;s, but some of their suggestions are useful for the urbane wannabe and can be applied immediately.<br />After a few pages of reading the text, it dawned on me that it's essentially written for young, twenty-something single men, who have finally arrived in the real world after college and it is time to shed their fraternity Neanderthal habits and grow up. In between the lines one can almost sense the author's telling their old acquaintances to shed their Sports Bar mentalities, buy cravats, smoking jackets, don English bowlers, and find the `Oscar Wildean dandy' that lies within us all. It's time to throw away Mettalica and Nine Inch Nails and develop a taste for Beethoven and Tchaikovsky. Everyone knows that jazz is the music of choice for the urbane man, and the authors give us a list of the basic artists to listen to in order to develop our gentleman ears. Let us not forget the all-essential silver flask in the breast pocket, to pull out and sip undisturbed in the empty elevator, in a gentlemanly fashion. (I'm afraid they lost me on that one. Flasks are for top-up drunks, not 21st century gentleman.)<br />Overall this little guide is a list of dos and don'ts about personal hygiene, what to read and what to drink, why it's not a good idea to burp at the table during a dinner party, and that the occasional facial at the local beautician is now socially acceptable and a perfect \\"me time\\" activity. For the young man \\"coming out\\", this book is an essential manual about lifestyle and manners.

Rather than the usual record one might expect about an individuals life, that is, chronological time, events of significance, famous personages met and their influence, etc, Jung records momentous aspects about his inner life, his life long and extraordinary relationship with the unconscious. As he states from the beginning, this book is a reflection concerning his self-realisation of the unconscious and its manifestations. In old age, he realised that so-called outward memories, the temporal existence of the senses, had faded, and what remained were memories of his inner life, which manifested in dreams and visions. He found that he could only write his life in terms of a personal myth, because he believed 'autobiography', as a form of truthful expression, was at best, unreliable. Memory, in other words, cannot be trusted. Thus, Memories, Dreams and Reflections, is a personal 'story' about a man's journey of spiritual enlightenment and self-realisation, the process of the unconscious finding expression in the outer world.<br />Jung's inner life was certainly extraordinary. From an early age, the sheer power of the unconscious made itself known to him in terrible visions. Jung must have been an unusually grounded child in order to withstand the psychic forces that pushed their way into his consciousness at such a young age. He survived these onslaughts, I believe, because he didn't resist them, but chose to grapple with the images, follow his instincts and, along with the violence of these images, came also a knowingness and feeling of safeness, that he was, even at a young age, following what he was meant to do. It is no wonder he became a psychiatrist, a \\"doctor of the soul\\" as he calls it; because by helping others through their personal journeys of realisation, he came to better understand his own.<br />At the end of Jung's life he maintained that he was not a mystic, a wise man or a sage. He admits that he drank from the stream of knowledge and life, but was not the stream itself. But what is a mystic in the traditional sense of this term? A mystic is one who, through meditation, prayer or other means, achieves direct intuitive experience of the divine. A mystic experiences these 'other realities' and brings their experiences back, in some cases, to share with the rest of us. To the mystic these experiences are real. Taking this definition at face value, Memories, Dreams and Reflections is a record of one man's intuitive experience with the divine. Jung made it his life's mission to express these experiences in such a way as to make them real, and to then formulate them into a psychological method, in the hope of helping others lost and searching for meaning in their lives. Jung was most assuredly a mystic. His writings tell us that there is something greater than ourselves within us, and our task is to grapple and understand this power, that he has chosen to call the unconscious; and by better understanding this greater part of ourselves, we can become more human.<br />This is a wonderful story about the inner life of a man, a mystic and original thinker.of knowledge and life, but was not the stream itself.

Crimes against humanity are a pretty serious business, and the international community are now beginning to take it very seriously, as they should, because without justice, no one is safe. It takes courage to go against individuals of power, and Hitchins has put himself squarely in the face of a man with considerable clout, who has a lot to answer for. What is mind boggling is that there should be enough evidence out there, and enough witnesses, particularly in regards to the secret meetings between Nixon and the South Vietnamese, stalling the peace negotiations, and prolonging that terrible war for another four years, costing thousands of American lives, not to mention a plethora of innocent deaths; add to the illegal bombings of Cambodia and Laos, and the extermination of literally thousands of civilians, instigated without congressional approval, should be enough to at least begin arraignment proceedings, though Kissinger manages to wriggle out of the legal spotlight, because I suspect, opening this particular can of worms would implicate more people, thus bringing shame upon everything good the United States stands for. If anything, Hitchens book presents a compelling case to begin arraignment proceedings against a man who clearly has many things to hide.<br />In this little book, Hitchens outlines several areas on the international stage where Henry Kissinger had influence or direct involvement with terrible crimes, including political assassination, massive genocide, illegal regime change, and war crimes that match, in terms of scope, the Nazi atrocities of WW II. In fact, it has reached a point where Kissinger refuses to enter certain countries for fear of being detained and arrested. As Hitchens points out, it takes a person with an excellent memory and intelligence to have gotten away with murder on a grand scale and for such a long time. What is telling, is that Kissinger will not come clean. Documents are currently hiding in the Library of Congress that would blow the lid off his illegal activities. The man is hiding behind what is termed \\"National Security\\". In other words, the contents of these documents, if revealed to the public at large, could present a dangerous security problem for the American people. Rubbish. The contents of these documents present a security problem for Henry Kissinger and his present and past cronies.<br />Where there is crime and the misuse of power, one will always find a money connection. In chapter 10, The Profit Margin, Hitchins touches upon Kissinger's company, Kissinger and Associates, and his corporate clients. It's a 'boy's club' on a world scale. It would be naive to believe that there wouldn't be at least a few financial and political improprieties connecting American corporations with foreign governments - Kissinger has been cashing in for a long time, and it's time someone had the courage to investigate him and bring this man to justice.<br />Hitchens book is not a thorough or by any means a comprehensive account of Kissinger's alleged crimes against humanity, but it is at least enough to start the wheels of justice turning in the right direction.ts are currently hiding in the Library of Congress that would blow the lid off his illegal activities.

It is no understatement that Paul Auster is one of the top literary writers alive and working today. He never fails to astonish with his playful approach to writing, experimenting with form, while entertaining the reader at the same time. This is a difficult thing to do. When attempting to write a metafictional piece, in some cases, form overrides the story itself, and the general reader is left wondering, scratching their respective heads, and abandoning the work. Auster, for me at any rate, has never failed to maintain my attention, interest and respect as a reader of all his work. Oracle Night, Auster's eleventh novel, is an hypnotic, mythical, magical experience, that draws the reader in with its peculiar ideas, circumstances and characters, yet at the same time, proposes some heavy and important questions concerning writers, the process of writing and the shear power of the written word.<br />The narrator of the text, Sidney Orr, a young writer, has been recovering from a near fatal illness and hasn't put pen to paper for some time. On one of his daily walks, he stumbles upon a stationary shop, the Paper Palace, run by a mysterious Chinaman. As Orr enters the store, time seems to stop, and there he discovers a set of beautiful Portuguese notebooks. He decides to buy the blue one, (a significant colour as we discover later) purchases it, which begins a journey of writing, coincidence, tales within tales, and the altering of time itself. When finally putting pen to paper in the blue notebook, the words flow, as they have never done before. Orr felt as if he was merely a bystander, as the words gushed forth effortlessly, forming a tale.

The choice Suskind made to write this book in the style of narrative non-fiction was a judicious one because it gives the general reader a greater feel and connection to the facts. Paul O'Neill, former U.S. Treasury Secretary to the Bush II administration, comes across in the text as someone who lives his philosophy, professionally and personally, and that is to work and live honestly, always seeking the truth, where performance and results win out over \\"appearance\\" or partisan politicking. When he accepted the job, he believed he could at least make a few in-roads to structuring economic policy that would benefit the nation as a whole. Contrary to his wife's advice, he entered, unknowingly, into an administration that already had an agenda, and as he soon discovered, G.W.B, was unlike any president he had worked for before. Sound, pragmatic economic policy that would benefit the country over the long term was thwarted; in fact, there was no effort to create policy at all  -this government seemed to only fly by the seat of its pants, manuvaring agendas in the direction of an unknown goal. O'Neill continued to ask himself, who is running the show, and to what end?<br /><br />As one reads further into the text, it becomes all too apparent who was and is running the country - and it certainly  the president. Bush is depicted as an ignoramus surrounded by neoconservative ideologues informing and shaping his every thought and opinion. O'Neill over the first year of his tenure, met with the president once a week to discuss economic policy. The Treasury Secretary was astonished to find the president did not really have an opinion or would ask any questions. Most meetings were the same, consisting of Bush simply sitting quietly, nodding and grunting, while the inner circle, a group of extraordinarily intelligent men and women, talked around him. As O'Neill comments, a now infamous quote in the book, \\"The only way I can describe it is that, well, the president is like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people. There is no discernable connection.\\"(P.149) O'Neill is an experienced and successful operator, having made it his business to gage individuals as to their intentions, philosophies and personality. After a year of one-on-one weekly meetings with the president, O'Neill perceived either an unwillingness to engage intelligently on important economic issues, or was, at bottom, incapable of engagement, due to a fundamental inability to understand the issues and concepts presented.<br /><br />As has been tradition for presidential (elects) in their first 100 days in office, is to make good, or at least be seen as making good, key campaign promises to the American people. It is curious and telling that, only ten days in office, at an NSC meeting, the first cab off the rank, so to speak, was about Iraq; new sanctions, better intelligence, military options, including the deployment of ground forces, and \\"regime change\\" Does this not set off a few alarm bells? This administration had a pre-set agenda about Iraq even before entering office. O'Neill as a man on the outside, on the edge of the inner sanctum, never had a chance.<br /><br />This book reveals a government that conceals intentions about their actions. There has always been another agenda, a secret agenda, and a man like Paul O'Neill, transparent, honest and concerned, was fired because this philosophy is anathema to this administration. This book is recommended to all concerned people.a roomful of deaf people.

Some would comment that `The Virgin Philosophers Series' does more harm than good, because the subject matter and the lives of the philosophers themselves are distilled to such an extent that it misinforms rather than informs. After reading the `Essential Wittgenstein' it is without question that Strathern has done a brilliant job of detailing Wittgenstein and his difficult philosophy in a comprehensive, single brush stroke, which should leave any reader chomping at the bit for more.<br />Most of this series follows a similar format of first outlining the philosophers life and work within the appropriate historical time and culture. In the case of Wittgenstein, Strathern highlights the tortured genius' major transitions from his privileged upbringing in pre WW1 Vienna, a noted intellectual/creative and tumultuous period before the fall of the Austria Hungarian empire. Wittgenstein was a neighbour of Sigmund Freud and went to Primary School with Adolph Hitler. In fact, both had remembered one another as adults. The author then tracks along to Wittgenstein's discovery of philosophy and his famous meeting and relationship with Bertrand Russell. It was during WW1 that Wittgenstein wrote (while he was a prisoner of war in Italy) his most famous work, `Tractatus Logico-Philoshicus', which transformed philosophy and the way we think about the world. It is here that Strathern attempts a heroic simple outline of this work, and to my mind a successful one.<br />If you are interested in a more comprehensive life history and appraisal of Wittgenstein's work, Ray Monk's brilliant biography, `The Duty of Genius' is highly recommended. For an in depth study of the man's philosophy, `The Wittgenstein Reader', A. Phillips Griffiths, ed., is also a good starting point. But the primary source, `Tractatus Logico-Philoshicus' is the first point anyone serious about investigating Wittgenstein should begin. That said, for a well-written, clear and general outline of this unusual philosopher, `The Virgin Philosophers Series' is a worthy primer. As the publisher's state, their aim is to clarify `...the mysteries of philosophy for the general reader.' They achieve this aim without question.er, `The Virgin Philosophers Series' is a worthy primer.

The Gospel according to Mary is a most welcome addition to the many once suppressed scriptures of early Christianity, discarded by Constantine and his councilman at Nicaea in the third century CE. The reasons for the exclusion of some texts over others would be an in-depth study of its own. In any event, the Naga Hammmadi texts, including the now famous Gospel of Thomas and Phillip, has not only shed new light on the history of Christianity, but has deepened our understanding of Christ's teachings, informing our faith and belief. Although the Gospel of Mary Magdalene has come to us in fragments, (parts of the text are missing) Leloup has proved himself an informed and intuitive exegete, giving us access to the meaning within the scripture. As Jacob Needleman expresses in his well written Forward: \\"One of the most remarkable aspects of `The Gospel of Mary Magdalene' is that the more it shows us about the meaning of Christianity, the more the mystery deepens.\\" This, to my mind, is the all-important aspect of spirituality, and that is our search is an on-going journey, in which the more the hidden is revealed, the greater the mystery becomes.<br />The figure of Mary Magdalene appears not only in the New Testament but also in the so-called Gnostic Gospels. She is referred to as the `apostles apostle' because she was a witness to Christ's death and the first He appeared to upon his resurrection. The figure of the Magdalene has appeared throughout the world in the form of myth, history and legend over the last two thousand years. The suppression of her importance within the church is a mystery, and the fact that this gospel was discovered a century ago in Egypt, its existence excluded to a small circle of scholars, and only now has come into the mainstream, is also a mystery. After reading this text, it became apparent that The Gospel according to Mary is that important feminine perspective of Christianity that has been missing for the last twenty centuries. It is that missing piece of doctrine that now gives us a fuller picture of Christ's ministry and his teachings.<br />As Leloup writes at the end of the text, The Gospel of Mary need not be \\"set up in opposition to other gospels or sacred scriptures, or against recent anthropological or scientific research.\\" This gospel, in other terms, does not contradict orthodox, but compliments Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, including Thomas and Phillip, in such a way that enhances our understanding, belief and relationship with the Divine.<br />This wonderful text is very accessible and can be read in one sitting. However its contents demand more focused reading and engagement in order to gain greater understanding of its many levels.issing piece of doctrine that now gives us a fuller picture of Christ's ministry and his teachings. <br />As Leloup writes at the end of the text, The Gospel of Mary need not be \\"set up in opposition to other gospels or sacred scriptures, or against recent anthropological or scientific research.\\" This gospel, in other terms, does not contradict orthodox, but compliments Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, including Thomas and Phillip, in such a way that enhances our understanding, belief and relationship with the Divine. <br />This wonderful text is very accessible and can be read in one sitting.

One could call this text a scorching polemic concerning America's largely clandestine pursuit of economic and military world dominance. It is more a slap-in-the-face-wake-up-call to pull the reigns in on our current power hungry leaders, who are presently leading us into a black hole that will be all too difficult to escape from in the future.<br />Johnson outlines the United States' imperialistic intentions and its many acquisitions since the 19th century. Most students of history are aware of these early acquisitions, starting with the Spanish American War, and shortly there after, the brutal conquering of the Philippines. These wars were justified with jingoistic rhetoric; at times rationalized in unadulterated propoganda to the American people, and then played down after the colony was established. Johnson goes on to outline the proliferation of militarism throughout the 20th century, particularly since the establishment of NSC 68 after WW2. The problem however, as Johnson points out, is that militarism and the acquisition of foreign lands are becoming less and less justified with euphemistic rhetoric, and are now boldly rendered without the approval of international law and the United States constitution ' as if to say, ''we're going to do it any way, whether you like it or not, because if you disagree, we'll put you on the hit list as well.' In other words, we do it because we can, and you can't stop us. The evidence in this book, in most cases, is irrefutable, because the facts and actions speak for themselves.<br />A compelling example is the reasons given for the current conquering and occupation of Iraq. The Bush 2 administration defied the United Nations and most of its long-term allies and invaded Iraq, stating they knew best, because the regime had WMD and was ready to unleash them on the 'free' world. There are no weapons of mass destruction, and the administration was told this by expert authorities from the beginning. It has been almost a year since the war began, and nothing has been found. The new party line, then, was a necessary 'regime change' because Hussein was a ruthless dictator and was a potential danger to the region. Granted he was a ruthless dictator, and committed heinous crimes against humanity, but any informed person is aware that countries like Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, which are current 'allies', and play a strategic role in the Middle East, have appalling human rights records and are ruled by quasi dictatorships. Why not impale our moral superiority on them as well? Were we lied to? Johnson writes,<br />'If so, then it seems that high government officials falsified pretext for the second Iraq war and committed a fraud against the Congress and the American people. In a constitutional republic, these are impeachable offences. The fact that such proceedings have not been mentioned is a further sign of the political decadence brought about by militarism and imperialism.' (P.306)<br />The trillions of dollars poured into the military-industrial complex in order to maintain close to eight hundred American bases strategically placed around the world cannot last forever. Money is pouring out of the country in the name of 'defence' and nothing of any significance is being done on the domestic front.<br />In other terms, as usual, the elites are benefiting, while the many are barely keeping up with their rents and paying for food. This is just one issue, but an important one.<br />In the last chapter of the book, Chalmers asks us to actually take back the reigns of power as the people, and stop the endless supply of money to the Pentagon and the secret intelligence agencies, turning the American economy from a war based one to a peace based economy, thus avoiding another possible 'blowback' like 9/11, and improving the common man's standard of living.<br />This is an important book and a necessary one to begin positive change away from war towards a lasting peace.the war began, and nothing has been found.

This provocative and informative little book explores the historical beginnings of Christianity. As has been pointed out by other critics, the text is, for the most part, a personal though scholarly exploration into what the Christian religion offers, in terms of its doctrines, orthodox and heretical, and that our faith or belief in what has been handed down to us from the original church fathers, can be questioned, though in the end, what we find to be true is a personal affair between us and the Divine.<br />Personally, gaining knowledge about the history of Christianity, its early writings, and the profound political influences that shaped `orthodoxy', in the first centuries of the first millennia, reveals aspects about Christianity that not only informs belief, but also provides deeper meaning and understanding.<br />Pagels' examines the differences between the Gospel of John in the New Testament and The Secret Gospel of Thomas, found in Nag Hammadi in 1947. Scholars believe these two texts to be written at the same time, around the first century. The central difference between the two Gospels is the interpretation of what actually constitutes Christ's nature, i.e., who he was and what he was, in terms of either being a prophet, a `man' endowed with the Divine spark, to then begin his ministry, spreading his word of love, or actually the Son of God, come down from heaven in human form to save us from our sins. In the Gospel of John, there is no question that Jesus is represented as the Divine, who has been born by Immaculate Conception, sacrificing himself on the cross to save us from our sins, and who rose from the dead three days later. In the Gospel of Thomas, however, Christ can be interpreted as human, who asks us to look within ourselves in order to understand God. He tells us to seek, and to not stop seeking, until we find the truth. This point of interpretation, as to Christ's true nature, was argued by the church fathers in the third century which set Christian doctrine in stone ever since. Certain gospels were deemed heretical based on certain interpretations, and thrown out of the canon. The Secret Gospel of Thomas was one of them.<br />The reasons for throwing out some scripture over others is examined in some detail in this book, however, the main reason was to ensure the church had a unifying doctrine that would bring the many Christian sects at the time under one authority, creating the Catholic or Universal church. As history has shown, they were successful. The reasons for their success, though, are not limited to `correct' interpretation of scripture, but extend to political, historical and cultural influences at the time.<br />I found this book to be beautifully written and informative, but it mostly inspired me to investigate the history of Christianity and how that history has shaped what it has become today.Christian doctrine in stone ever since.

A few years ago, prior to ~Dreaming War's~ publication, the article, `Goat Song', was emailed to me from a friend. In this article, Vidal lists the numerous anomalies prior, during and directly after the events of 9/11. The questions this article raises are legitimate, considering the U.S. government has spent literally trillions of dollars on national \\"defence\\" since 1947. When the alarm bells began to ring on that terrible day, those in charge did not follow military protocol, but merely sat on their hands, and seemed to let it happen. This is a frightening thought. In the end, the investigation into these anomalies turned into a finger pointing exercise, and a few scapegoats made, but to this day, some questions still remain. However, Vidal has no doubts as to the aspirations and motivations of the current government's actions in the Middle East; as the title of the book makes perfectly clear: Blood for Oil. To finally read the full article and the ten or so other pieces in the book after reading that initial email was informative and quite disturbing. Vidal certainly lays it all on the line.<br />Gore Vidal has been called many things, but for certain, he has made it his life's mission to understand American history and point out how and why his beloved Republic has gone off the rails, particularly since the creation in 1947 of NSC-68. He laments the loss of his Republic to a National Security State, (Military Industrial Complex) including a noticeable dwindling of the Bill of Rights. The loss of the rights of citizens in a democratic country is a frightening scenario, (in my opinion, the worst scenario) and it's actually happening right before our eyes. Domination, control and wealth are the motivations, and the events Vidal has illustrated over the last half century, and that is nearly two hundred `incursions' in other countries since 1945...in which the U.S. has been the aggressor, is simply too hard to ignore.<br />In the article, `Mickey Mouse, Historian', Vidal discusses the corporate ownership of America and the politicians, but also states, generally, what he would like to see changed:<br />\\" I am a patriot of the old Republic that slowly unravelled during the expansionist years and quite vanished in 1950 when the National Security State took its place. Now I want us to convert from wartime to a peacetime economy. But since the GE-style conglomerates that govern us will never convert, something will have to give, won't it?\\" (P.165)<br />Vidal not only lists the many problems about his beloved country, but also offers solutions that sound workable and real. But those holding power at the moment will be hard pressed to let the current system go. This book is highly recommended to anyone concerned about American and international affairs.Vidal discusses the corporate ownership of America and the politicians, but also states, generally, what he would like to see changed:<br />\\" I am a patriot of the old Republic that slowly unravelled during the expansionist years and quite vanished in 1950 when the National Security State took its place.

This collection of six essays and speeches by America's most astute and acerbic critic, though somewhat dated, (written from 1987-92) still manages to pack a powerful and relevant punch directly at what Vidal perceives to be the reasons for America's political, cultural and economic continuing downward spiral. He states in the Preface that his intention is to \\"...put into historical perspective the state of our nation and what can be done to salvage it.\\" (p.5)<br />In the essay, The National Security State, he explains its history and formation and its official start in the National Security Act of 1947; this was a blueprint created after WW2, which the country had never seen before. This doctrine, (only declassified in 1975) grants the pentagon unlimited power and spending on \\"defence\\" against the Soviet Union during peacetime. To justify such a massive spending on weapons, part of the document states that the American society had to be \\"mobilized\\" to fight communism. This, of course, manifested in the form of media-generated propaganda, creating fear in the hearts of ordinary Americans, to justify high taxes to pay for defence during peacetime. Vidal writes, \\"...thanks to the brainwashing of the national security state's continuing plan, Americans have a built-in horror of the Evil Empire, which the press and the politicians have kept going for forty years.\\" Now that this particular \\"Evil Empire\\" has unfortunately fallen, we currently have a new \\"Axes of Evil\\" to justify billions of dollars spent on \\"defence\\".<br />It is impossible to cite all of Vidal's arguments in the space provided. However, rather than merely list everything wrong with America, he offers solutions, albeit radical solutions, to some of the problems. For example, the campaign-funding system for presidential candidates is fundamentally problematic, as it opens the door for corruption at every turn. If a candidate doesn't want to be bought, he shouldn't take campaign donations from specialist and corporate groups. In other democratic countries, including Australia, the taxpayers provide campaign funds and the actual four to six week campaign is broadcast on public television. This ensures that no special interest group can tarnish a politician with promises of unlimited cash for unlimited airtime on commercial television. The campaign is short and \\"corporate free\\". This one solution he offers, however, to my mind, would fundamentally pave the way to a less corruptive and more democratic system.<br />Vidal is deeply concerned about the United States and its perceived decline. The problems he writes about are real, and his solutions, though radical on face value, are pragmatic and workable. These essays strike right at the heart of the matter and despite being somewhat dated, are relevant today.and corporate groups.

It requires a special talent to combine scientific, clinical prose with personal, emotional and philosophical insight. This book is remarkable on many counts, but its value lies in Sacks' honesty, uninhibited rendering of the personal, by and while incorporating his desire to see his profession, neurology and psycho neurology, evolve from a largely `veterinary business\\", the dualistic approach to the mind as `mental' or `physical', to a science combining both approaches, in what he would like to call the \\"neurology of identity\\". In his terms, he would like to see neurology take \\"a great jump - to jump from the mechanical model, the \\"classical\\" model, it has espoused for so long, to a totally personal, self-referential model of the brain and mind\\". (p.189) This text eloquently strives in this direction.<br />In the early seventies, Sacks experienced a hiking accident that severely damaged his left leg. This near death experience (he was stranded alone on a mountain miles away from civilization) began a journey of a profound personal nature, existential, professional, philosophical, spiritual and physical, which changed his views about many things. The first chapter, `The Mountain', has all the suspense and narrative style of a well-written thriller. To a large extent, in the next chapter, \\"Becoming a Patient\\", has all the hallmarks of the familiar insensitive doctor as mere technician, evolving a more empathetic view of the patient, developing that essential `bedside manner' that can be so lacking, though essential, in the medical profession. Sacks describes his thoughts and feelings as a patient, having to relate his condition and feelings to his carer's, and the utter dread, loneliness, frustration, and alienation that comes with becoming ill and having to be institutionalized as a result. Anyone who has been ill and hospitalized will relate to this chapter.<br />The essential aspects of the text are the medical insights Sacks' gained as a result of his damaged leg. He experienced first-hand the phenomenon of intense loss of `body-image', that is the damaged leg became entirely `alienated' from his primary consciousness. This is more than just forgetting how to use one's leg after damage, but an actual vanishing of awareness of the limb itself. In his terms, a total collapse of memory/identity/space, \\"...an abyss or hole: a hole in memory/identity/space\\" of the limb. He goes on to write, \\"A Leg to Stand On is not just a story of a leg, but an account, from inside, of what primary consciousness is like; an account such as the experience of alienation...\\" (P.187)<br />This book is a splendid tale about the journey of healing. As all great philosophical writing does, it asks us to question ourselves, question our environment and attempt to see what has been right before our eyes from the beginning. It also affirms that human experience is a community affair, that we all share these experiences and can ultimately learn from them.ext are the medical insights Sacks' gained as a result of his damaged leg.

Considering my stereotyped image of a neurologist, i.e., having that strict 'scientific' view of the human being (the mind/brain having solely mechanical processes, devoid of 'soul'; a noticeable unawareness or avoidance of a human's actual 'being', that purely 'clinical' approach to the patient as mere 'subject') was exploded in a thousand pieces after reading this special book. Sacks' general humanity in general and particularly for his patients glimmered bright from every page. As a doctor, researcher and therapist in this field, he communicates quite freely and clearly as to his personal views on his profession and where he would like it to go:<br />\\"The patient's essential being is very relevant in the higher reaches of neurology, and in psychology; for here the patient's personhood is essentially involved, and the study of disease and the identity cannot be disjoined. Such disorders, and their depiction and study, indeed entail a new discipline, which we may call the 'neurology of identity', for it deals with the neural foundations of the self, the age-old problem of mind and brain.' (X)<br />This book is a collection of twenty-four cases, clinical tales about people who, in some cases, have been struck with terrible brain related illnesses during the prime of their lives. The physical, emotional and very foundations of how they function and view the world, has been drastically altered. In the case of 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat', Dr. P., a musician of distinction, teacher and accomplished painter, developed a type of visual agnosia or prosopagnosia, where he could not recognize faces and came to see things, people and objects as something else. His entire perceptions of the world had totally changed. One aspect of this particular story that was interesting was Dr. P's paintings, which Sacks observed hanging on the wall of his home. In the beginning the paintings depicted a 'realist' style, almost mirror representations; as the years went by, each painting became more impressionistic, ending in the most recent work being entirely abstract. Sacks made a comment about this fact to the Dr.'s wife, who believed that his artistic style simply matured over the years. However Sacks saw the paintings as representing the progressive nature of the man's condition. I found this case to be at once bizarre, interesting and sad.<br />Most if not all of the cases in this book are bizarre, interesting and sad, but Dr. Sacks conveys a deep humanity, a scientific concern and a real hope that the profession will find more effective ways in dealing with the brain. He believes the profession should re-think their approaches; perhaps ask different questions, however, most importantly, not forget that, as physicians, they're not dealing with just 'clinical subjects', but human beings with identity. In other words, to truly understand the brain/ mind relation, the essential being, science and the humanities must join forces. One can see from this wonderful book, that Oliver Sacks has already attempted to do just this, with varying degrees of success.<br />This is a book that drastically changed my views on a lot of things, not least the utter vastness of the mind, and how easily we can lose what we take for granted everyday.painting became more impressionistic, ending in the most recent work being entirely abstract.

Generally human behaviour is odd at the best of times. As inhabitants of the planet, most of us do try to live happy and productive lives against varying degrees of opposition, and sometimes our coping skills, the actions we take to be happy, appear to others, including ourselves, to be quite bizarre. This book is a selection of unusual cases from the files of leading therapists. It should be made clear from the start that this isn?t a freak show, tales of the macabre, but a genuine telling of memorable cases from professionals who have made it their life?s work to help people in dire need.<br />After finishing the text, it also became clear to me that the business of the mind, psychiatry and psychology, is by no means a strict science. The various therapeutic techniques out their being used around the world run into the thousands. It is a social science that is constantly changing and developing. In other terms, there is no blanket cure all ? a miracle technique to make us into happy productive people.<br />After reading these cases, what most of the therapists had in common was their intuition. They?re confronted by an unusual case, and through active listening, a bit of trial and error, in some instances a breakthrough was made. Sometimes a little progress is made and the session ends, leaving the therapist to remain wondering for years what happed to that particular client. Some of the cases in this collection are exceedingly bizarre, while others, to a great extent, touched the heart. Some of us are pretty resilient beings and can put up with a lot of suffering and pain, and somehow come out smiling. Moreover, there are some cases represented in this book that showed me that some of us need our illnesses simply to live on a day-to-day basis.<br />Out of the thirty-one cases in the text, all interesting and unique in their own way, one stood out for me the most. The therapist was Bradford Keeney, and the case is called: ?The Medicine Man Who Never Had a Vision.? What makes this case unique was Keeney?s uncanny intuition about how to handle the Indian Shaman. The treatment would not be found in any textbook. In fact, the treatment came to him in a vision! The Shaman followed Keeney?s instructions to the letter to great results. What was even more fascinating was what transpired later, when another Indian came to Keeney with a problem that sent chills up my spine. He dreamed of being confronted by warriors, and his face painted red. The man awoke with his face actually painted red! He was troubled by this and needed some advice from the ?white? medicine man. This case reinforced the fact that the mind and spirit have far greater potential and depth than we care to admit.<br />This book is written with genuine compassion and a noticeable humanity. Highly recommended to those interested in the mind and our culture in general.n.? What makes this case unique was Keeney?s uncanny intuition about how to handle the Indian Shaman.

This is the first novel in many years that I was motivated to read after viewing its film adaptation. The film of the same name is a work of art, though the novel surpasses the picture in terms of its depth, subtlety and intelligent imitation and homage to Virginia Woolf's novel, Mrs. Dalloway. As this was the author's stated intent, to my mind, he was wholly successful. Particularly the Dalloway chapters, it was if I was reading a 21st century version of Virginia Woolf's masterpiece. This novel is a superb piece of writing. Cunningham evokes the thoughts, impressions and inner feelings of his three main characters and their unique associations, and cleverly connects them by way of prosaic nuance and understated references to Woolf's novel. In fact, there are so many connections between the two novels, it would require several readings to find them all. This is a true literary achievement because Cunningham's execution, on the surface, seems effortless. His prose is liquid, flowing in and out of the minds and circumstances of each character with empathy, intense sensitivity and realism.  However, the book's real achievement is the reader does not necessarily need to have an acquaintance with Mrs. Dalloway in order to appreciate Cunningham's incredible novel.<br />That said, having read Woolf's Mrs Dalloway, viewing the film more than once, and now having read Cunningham's novel, my appreciation and understanding of all three has become much richer as a result. Woolf's battle with mental illness and her exploration on the boundaries between 'insanity'and what we've come to believe as 'sanity', and her views on suicide, for example, have become a lot clearer to me after reading The Hours. All three works are major triumphs in themselves, but have managed to end up complimenting each other in insightful ways.<br />My suggestion would be to read this elegant novel, read Woolf's masterpiece, and see the film again. If time doesn't permit or you're not inclined to do so, at least read this novel, it will be well worth your time.at least read this novel, it will be well worth your time.	2004-01-25

Depending on which side of the political fence you're on, Noam Chomsky can either represent the lone voice of truth shining forth from the depths of corruption and power, or a ranting, liberal lunatic, who sees conspiracies in every corner, monolithic `thought police', manufacturing illusion unknowingly on the masses, and those pulling the levers, residing comfortably behind computer screens at the New York Times. Since his magnum opus, `Manufacturing Consent', the far right has dismissed him entirely, calling this erudite work the scribblings of a madman. Despite this book's labyrinthine and somewhat dense arguments, his evidence is compelling. In our education system, for example, in certain history classes, we teach the workings of propaganda, particularly those efforts made by governments to round up more enlistments for the military to fight in WWI. For the most part, students find these examples laughable, but then are astonished, when comparing such propaganda with present day attempts by various governments around the world. A student asks, \\"Do they really think they can fool us with this stuff?\\" The response is \\"Yes, and they do it all the time and, more often than not, it works.\\" Controlling public opinion has been on political agendas since the beginnings of civilization, the point, however, is whether we are able to recognize it for what it is and form our opinions accordingly. ~Hegemony or Survival~ is Chomsky's first major work in years, and he pulls no punches as it is a controversial and shocking text as to what it reveals.<br />But what is so shocking?<br />The premise of the book is a simple one. That is, since the end of WW II, the United States government has been ruthlessly pursuing world dominance, and it is known as \\"the grand imperial strategy\\". To comprehend this strategy, we need to understand the ideology underpinning it various policies. Chomsky suggests that it was formed based on a particular political view - Wilsonian Idealism - and that is, the \\"men of best quality\\" must rule over \\"the giddy multitude of beasts\\", the masses, in order to \\"...safeguard a system of elite-decision-making and public ratification - \\"polyarchy\\", in the terminology of political science - not \\"democracy\\". (p.5) Contrary to democratic ideals, the \\"dumb herd\\" (you and me) must be controlled, using coercion as a tool to \\"tame the beast\\", so that the goals of the state can be furthered and accomplished. This privileged elite, currently key players in the Bush II administration, \\"knows best\\", ignoring and lying to the public, breaking international law, committing acts of terrorism in the name of freedom and democracy on a grand scale, betraying alliances, switching sides when it suits them, all in the name of economic, military and political hegemony, risking the very survival of the planet itself.<br />This, of course, may sound alarmist, if not bordering on treason, but the evidence Chomsky provides, in a few important cases, is beyond dispute.<br />Therefore I submit that no matter what side of the political fence you're on, read this book, research the validity of his sources before dismissing it entirely, and then make up your mind.that is, the \\"men of best quality\\" must rule over \\"the giddy multitude of beasts\\", the masses, in order to \\"...safeguard a system of elite-decision-making and public ratification - \\"polyarchy\\", in the terminology of political science - not \\"democracy\\".

What has made America a great nation in the eyes of the world over the last two hundred years, is not its major technological advances, it competent military or its advances in all the arts, but its original pure ideals on what constitutes a free society, and the inalienable rights of the individual living in that society. The founding fathers of the United States knew all too well the corruptive nature of power. The creation of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights would ensure that those within its government seeking absolute power could be kept in check. In this ideal society, the state has limited power over its citizens, but just enough power to maintain peace within its borders. What is shocking about this short collection of essays by Gore Vidal, is he soberly illustrates with hard fact examples, particularly since the Oklahoma bombing and the events of 9/11, that the Bill of Rights and the important principles it states, protecting the rights of all citizens, is being manipulated to serve a small elite. The people are slowly, over time, losing their rights, because it is said, for their own protection.<br />As a child growing up in the United States, there were three things I was taught, and that was always to respect the rights of others, always say please and thank you, and Governments always lie. \\"Never believe a politician, son. Because no matter what they say, there is always a hidden agenda.\\" Time and again, this simple statement has turned out to be true. Sometimes their lies are found out. As a people, however, we have a tendency to forgetfulness, a kind of in-built amnesia, to then blindly vote our dubious leaders back into office. Facing the awful truth, in most cases, is much too hard, because it is easier to accept sugarcoated reasons, media-generated propaganda, and not take responsibility and face the fact that at least part of the problem is with us.<br />Vidal points out that there has been nearly two hundred `incursions' since 1945...\\"in which the United States has been the aggressor.\\" As he states in the introduction, \\"It is the law of physics (still on the books when last I looked) that in nature there is no action without reaction. The same appears in human nature - that is, history.\\" (ix) Might the two terrible events of Oklahoma and 9/11 be the result of past military `incursions' by the U.S. and her allies in other countries?<br />I found this collection of essays to be both incredibly disturbing and enlightening at the same time. In fact, after finishing the book, sleep became difficult. I don't know whether the United States knows it or not, because it is the most powerful nation in the world, and therefore an example to us all, what they do or not do, affects the entire planet. Australia has always looked to America as an example, (whether we care to admit it or not) and I don't like where our big brother is leading us at the moment.<br />The basic premise of Vidal's book is the ultimate damage from terrorism is not a physical one, but the true knockout blow is our vanishing liberties. Those in power submit that we must sacrifice or freedoms because we're at war. I submit, without our God given liberties, our rights as contributing members of society; war is moot, because there's nothing else worth fighting for.hich the United States has been the aggressor.\\" As he states in the introduction, \\"It is the law of physics (still on the books when last I looked) that in nature there is no action without reaction.

This scholarly though very accessible text explores the early Christian interpretations of the Book of Genesis, particularly Adam and Eve's exile from paradise, due to disobeying God, and partaking of the forbidden fruit. The Fall of Man continues to be debated as to its significance, in terms of its influence on modern civilization: sexual, religious, cultural, political and sociological affect on our general attitudes and beliefs about human nature, the nature of the Divine, and our place in existence, as Pagels convincingly points out, is truly pervasive and profound.<br />It can be argued that the subject of theology is or has become a disciplined subject like any other `social science', because it employs similar methods of analysis and interpretation to present its perspective arguments. The arguments on this particular point continue to rage, too, in academic circles. Because religion and the `reading' of scripture can be tainted with prior beliefs and literal interpretations, some would argue that exegesis does not belong in the `rigorous' systems of the secular humanities. But here we are touching upon another subject of the humanities known as hermeneutics: the interpretation of texts. In the realm of theology, the term `exegesis' (interpretation of scripture or what one reads out of the text) and `eisegesis': an analysis or meaning one projects into scripture, or reading into the text, as a way to justify the readers pre-conceived beliefs, is another subject of contention. (It can also be argued that all reading is subjective, and what the individual reader brings to the text is what gives the text meaning.) However, Pagels presents her method of interpretation of scripture and the historical perspectives she intends to use clearly in her introduction:<br />\\"I am interested in a process of intellectual history...in the hermeneutical process - how Christians read the story of Adam and Eve, and often projected themselves into it, as a way of reflecting upon such matters as sexuality, human freedom, and human nature.\\" (xxi)<br />Pagels' text is an historical analysis of the various interpretations of  The Fall, and how these interpretations were affected by cultural and historical conditions, beginning with the early Christian writers in the New Testament, including the radical interpretations of certain early Gnostic writers, ending with the highly influential interpretations of St. Augustine and the writings of John Chrysostom and the Pelagians. St. Augustine and the Pelagians hold entirely opposite views on the meaning of The Fall, where only one, interestingly, has managed to hold significance, down through the ages, for modern Christians.<br />On the surface, this text appears complex and written purely for an academic audience. But what makes this book brilliant is its accessibility to all intelligent readers interested in the history of Western religion and how its ideas has shaped our modern world.on such matters as sexuality, human freedom, and human nature.\\" (xxi)<br />Pagels' text is an historical analysis of the various interpretations of  The Fall, and how these interpretations were affected by cultural and historical conditions, beginning with the early Christian writers in the New Testament, including the radical interpretations of certain early Gnostic writers, ending with the highly influential interpretations of St. Augustine and the writings of John Chrysostom and the Pelagians.

In the fall of 1960, Edgar Berman visited West Africa in Lambarene to meet with the famous humanitarian, in order to gain an understanding of his motivations and inspirations, but more particularly, why a man with so many talents, chose to live and work in such primitive and debilitating conditions for over fifty years.  Berman's reasons for going to Africa were in no way altruistic; he wasn't there to help necessarily, but to pick Schweitzer's brain. Over the few months of his visit, Berman worked hard, performing surgeries on the natives, in exchange for conversations with the old doctor. Berman, to his benefit, was entirely honest with Schweitzer from the beginning, declaring his true motivations from the start. Schweitzer made a deal with him - if he worked hard and proved competent, he would answer his questions. This book is largely a `record' of those conversations, covering Schweitzer's comments concerning his religious convictions, his philosophy and the reasons for his long service at Lambarene.<br />Berman claims that most of these conversations were taken `verbatim' as he kept a diary during his time at the hospital. He also admits that `some' of the comments are `distilled versions' of those conversation, memory exercises taken from his wife's recollections and his own. As Berman didn't speak German and had a little knowledge of French, while Schweitzer spoke little English, these conversations required an interpreter. Taking these facts into consideration, the reader should be warned that Schweitzer's comments are second or even third hand, and should not be viewed as things he actually conveyed to Berman. These conversations are Berman's interpretations; written years after the event, and anyone reading this text should keep this firmly in mind.<br />Bottom line, I found this book to be disappointing, as it is a memoir predominately about the illustrious Dr. Berman himself - his conservative views on politics, religion, his interpretations of Schweitzer's Reverence for Life philosophy and his final judgements about the great man and his work at Lambarene. Berman name-drops throughout the narrative. Famous people he has known such as the famous Zen scholar, Daisetz T. Suzuki; Father Teilhard the Jesuit writer and Pope Paul VI. Name-dropping is a shallow effort at self-promotion, an ego-puffing exercise to prove one's self-importance. It was evident that he took great pains to drop these names in a relevant context, but to my mind, without success.(In some cases, his name-dropping had a rumour-monger tone to it.) This text may claim to be about its subject, but the subtext is all Berman.<br />In the end, did Berman find the answers he was looking for? Not really. Schweitzer was an anomaly before he visited Lambarene and remained one after. Berman simply didn't get it; Schweitzer's deep spirituality and integrity to follow his calling, sacrificing the `good life' to work in primitive conditions, went way over Berman's head. Berman is a surgeon, and allegedly a good one, with a knack for self- promotion, which made it more than clear he prefers the high life, (See Chapter 23) and hobnobbing with the rich and famous.<br />To gain an understanding of Schweitzer, read `Out of My Life and Thought'.

The pursuit of knowledge, the practice of service to one's fellows, hardship and suffering and ultimately, a true comprehension and temperance of our lower natures, all combine to lead us to a better understanding of our existence. In this curious and important essay, Hall describes the shared destinies of all of us; and that is our pursuit of truth and our conscious or unconscious hunger for a meaningful relationship with the Divine. He warns and laments about our modern tendencies to material gain and instant gratification in all things worldly. Over time, he suggests, the methods used in attaining material gratification has translated into our spiritual endeavours. One cannot deny the plethora of `expert' advise out there, presenting in many guises, to attain Wisdom in \\"ten easy steps\\". Become an all-powerful, influential guru and mammoth success, getting rich in the process. For a substantial fee, ladies and gentleman, we can show you the secrets of the ancients and throw in a no-fail diet to boot. This, of course, is not the road to Wisdom. The true road, Hall suggests, is a long and arduous one, fraught with suffering and difficult lessons, where one's hope lies in one's sincere labour, courage, true aspiration and egoless silence.<br />This short essay is recommended to anyone interested in sound and universal advice in their pursuit of a greater understanding of themselves and existence.	2003-12-30

One cannot really expect anything else other than a tautly crafted thriller/mystery from the works of Michael Connelly. When reading and turning the pages of his works, one has the distinct impression that they're in the presence of a writer in full mastery of his art form, a professional writer, a mature writer, who has worked years to perfect their chosen form of expression. Similar to great athletes, great writers make it look easy. Connelly's writing is effortless, gently pulling us into his tales, creating a tacit pact with the reader, where, it doesn't feel like reading anymore, but something else. ~Chasing the Dime~ is one of those reading experiences.<br />This story gets you started, keeps you going, and at the end, doesn't disappoint.<br />I believe that most of Connelly's protagonists are, in one way or another, seeking some kind of redemption. Some event in their past continues to haunt them in the present. What seems to motivate them is the goal of reconciliation, a closure, perhaps forgiveness. In this novel, Henry Pierce is seduced into a world of taboos; the dark side of society, and what drives him into the sludge is not sordid curiosity, naivety or simple boredom, but an unconscious wish to change himself on some level. What the man has been chasing all his life, outside himself, could well be the wrong thing. Above the action, dialogue and intrigue in the story, is a man coming to terms with his demons, his past.<br />Michael Connelly not only gives us an entertaining and well-constructed crime mystery, but something much more to think about.	2003-12-29

The novels of Dean Koontz are peculiar, macabre, at times downright horrific, though have that familiar atmosphere of the prosaic and everyday. He has that mysterious facility as a writer to create extremely strange circumstances and involve characters that would not normally find themselves in adventures far more exciting than a weekday trip to the shopping mall. His gift is to put normal people into abnormal situations and make it believable. Dean Koontz latest novel is a wonderful example of this particular gift. <br />Mr. Odd Thomas is indeed one of the nicest characters you will meet in the world of fiction. The young man is humble, a talented fry cook, head over heels in love with his girlfriend, and his only ambition is to move on from frying eggs to selling new tires at the local tire store. By today's standards, he would be considered a first class loser in anyone's book. But there is something special about Odd Thomas, and that is the fact that he can see and communicate with the dead. As he explains in the narrative, sometimes the departed have a hard time moving on to the next world, whether it be because of unfinished business, a sentimental attachment to the living, or an unawareness of their deadness; Thomas is always there to help if his help is required. In fact he believes it is his moral duty to aid the dead, otherwise why would he have this gift in the first place? The plot unfolds when he spots a strange looking individual enter his place of work, the Pico Mundo Grille, and orders breakfast. Surrounding the stranger are bodachs, entities that appear like swimming shadows, which only manifest when death, chaos, blood and destruction will occur sometime in the future. Odd's sixth sense, including the swarm of bodachs, tells him that something is terribly wrong and he begins his investigation.

The novels of Dean Koontz are peculiar, macabre, at times downright horrific, though have that familiar atmosphere of the prosaic and everyday. He has that mysterious facility as a writer to create extremely strange circumstances and involve characters that would not normally find themselves in adventures far more exciting than a weekday trip to the shopping mall. His gift is to put normal people into abnormal situations and make it believable. Dean Koontz latest novel is a wonderful example of this particular gift.<br />Mr. Odd Thomas is indeed one of the nicest characters you will meet in the world of fiction. The young man is humble, a talented fry cook, head over heels in love with his girlfriend, and his only ambition is to move on from frying eggs to selling new tires at the local tire store. By today's standards, he would be considered a first class loser in anyone's book. But there is something special about Odd Thomas, and that is the fact that he can see and communicate with the dead. As he explains in the narrative, sometimes the departed have a hard time moving on to the next world, whether it be because of unfinished business, a sentimental attachment to the living, or an unawareness of their deadness; Thomas is always there to help if his help is required. In fact he believes it is his moral duty to aid the dead, otherwise why would he have this gift in the first place? The plot unfolds when he spots a strange looking individual enter his place of work, the Pico Mundo Grille, and orders breakfast. Surrounding the stranger are bodachs, entities that appear like swimming shadows, which only manifest when death, chaos, blood and destruction will occur sometime in the future. Odd's sixth sense, including the swarm of bodachs, tells him that something is terribly wrong and he begins his investigation.

Separating proved to be much more complicated than either of the men first envisaged. Jung was heralded to be the &#34;Crown prince&#34; of the fledgling movement, but disagreements with the master over core doctrines proved to be far too radical for Jung to attempt to create reconciliation. After this break they never uttered a word to each other again. During this time Jung fell into a period of self-analysis that he has written about in his autobiography, 'Memories, Dreams and Reflection'. It was also during this time that he wrote a curious text that he titled ' The Seven Sermons of the Dead&#34;. He reports that strange phenomenon in his house began before the writing: loud retorts from invisible sources; a series of disturbing dreams experienced by Jung and his children. At one point he said the house seemed to fill with an invisible presence, a crowd. It was at this stage that he was compelled to write, ordered, in a sense, to scribe what is now known as this text. The esoteric, magical and ultimately Gnostic overtone of the work is without question. Curiously, Jung was not the 'author' of the text, but the ancient Alexandrian Gnostic heretic, Basilides. The work begins:<br />  VII Sermones ad Mortuos<br />'Seven exhortations to the dead, written by Basilides in Alexandria, the city where East and West meet.'<br />In chapter three we are given the seven sermons in their entirety. The remaining chapters are devoted to interpreting and analysing the contents, sermon by sermon.<br />One does not necessarily need to have a strong acquaintance with Gnosticism in order to fully appreciate this book. Hoeller clearly provides the reader with enough background information on the subject in order to follow his well-written exegesis on the sermons themselves. Hoeller's arguments centre on the indisputable connection between the sermons and Jung's depth psychology with Gnosticism. The 'sermons' are clearly Gnostic and expound, symbolically, on the spirit and its relationship with the Divine.<br />Stephen Hoeller is an excellent writer and his passion and knowledge of philosophy and comparative religion shines forth from every page. He believes Jung to be the modern Gnostic, bringing the once and future Gnosis with us again. This is an important book as it guides us to look within ourselves to possibly discover what we all are consciously or unconsciously searching for.on the sermons themselves.

The demonic figure known to most as Satan has come to represent many things for many people. For some he is the mythological personification of everything wrong with the world. Satan is the representation of pure evil and its manifestation on earth. To others, he is the actual treacherous fallen member of the divine court whom, because of his refusal to bow before God's creation, the human being, he was ostracised from heaven and has been hell-bent on proving to God that we are all a big mistake. This is sibling rivalry on a grand-cosmic scale. In this well argued text, Pagel proposes a different view of Satan, a social history of the representation of evil. In her own words:<br />\\"[The] social implications of the figure of Satan: how he is invoked to express human conflict and to characterize human enemies within our own religious traditions.\\"<br />Her argument sets out to reveal major faults in the early writings of the Christian tradition. That Satan was a necessary adversary that characterized all that opposed the then new religion - Jews, pagans and heretics - confirming for Christians a solid identification with God -\\"...and to demonize their opponents.\\" By identifying one's opponents and enemies with the forces of evil on a cosmic scale, one's faith and belief is strengthened. She goes on to argue that the personification of Satan is \\"...a reflection of how we perceive others - (he) has made a profession out of being the `other''. Our worldview of most peoples has always been characterized in terms of binary oppositions, human/non human, and we/they; in other words, our tendency is to dehumanize our enemies, at times escalating `them' as opponents to a level of cosmic proportions. Through projecting `evil' on to the `other' and further escalating it to a cosmic scale, it becomes a war between `us' and `them', good against evil, as God is on our side and Satan, the great adversary, is on `their' side. The examples from history of escalating and justifying war by positioning the conflict to a cosmic scale are almost too numerous to mention.<br />Pagel concludes by proposing that we stop projecting evil on the `other' as something outside ourselves, and begin to reflect, to dig down to the root of evil within us. Through recognizing evil as something within us, and thereby dealing with it on a personal level, reconciliation can begin.<br />This is a scholarly, important and illuminating book.by positioning the conflict to a cosmic scale are almost too numerous to mention. <br />Pagel concludes by proposing that we stop projecting evil on the `other' as something outside ourselves, and begin to reflect, to dig down to the root of evil within us.

The Hagakure was dictated by Yamamoto and later scribed verbatim by Tsuramoto Tashiro over a period of seven years (1710-1716) in which they lived together in a far off mountain retreat in Japan. Tashiro was sworn to secrecy over the texts contents because the author believed the teachings to be far too radical and too militaristic for the then peaceful times during the Shogunate Rule (1603-1867). During this time of unusual calmness, the teachings of Buddhism and the ethical codes of Confucius permeated Japan, enriching every aspect of her culture from arts to politics. But the old Samurai, Yamamoto, believed (though acknowledging the Buddha and the tenets of Confucius) that the Samurai, as a class, had become effeminate and weak. Yamamoto's basic premise was that the Samurai could not serve two masters (religion and the Clan) and by doing so had become less effective. The service of the lord and the clan should come first, and once this was done, one could then amuse oneself with the studies of the humanities. In writing the Hagakura, Yamamoto hoped that someday the Samurai would return to the purity of its strong and compassionate past. More than this, however, he wanted to create a class of super-men. As Tanaka explains in his historical overview:<br />\\"In his (Yamamoto) talks, he wanted every Samurai to become a super-man. But he wanted super-men who were capable of gaining great power, not for their own self-interest, but for the interest of the clan. He wanted super-men who were capable of operating effectively for the solidarity of the clan.\\" (xv)<br />This is the key to the power and longevity of the way of the Samurai, and that is its notion of devout loyalty to the Lord of the Clan and the Clan itself. All other concerns in life are simply deemed irrelevant. Moreover, that other essential dictum, do your duty to your parents. And lastly, but most importantly, ensuring compassion for all sentient beings and the devout service of others. By devoting oneself to these vows of allegiance and practicing them, Yamamoto believed the Samurai would attain super-man status.<br />This particular translation is divided into eleven books, covering personal, social and philosophical advice from How to Excel Above Others, How to Conduct Yourself, Spiritual Vigour and  Conceal Your Wisdom. These titles really speak for themselves.<br />This is an excellent text to prime oneself on the foundational tenets of the way of the Samurai and a good introduction to the history of Japanese culture and thought in terms of social discourse and philosophical perspective.to these vows of allegiance and practicing them, Yamamoto believed the Samurai would attain super-man status.<br />This particular translation is divided into eleven books, covering personal, social and philosophical advice from How to Excel Above Others, How to Conduct Yourself, Spiritual Vigour and  Conceal Your Wisdom.

This is an elegant though brief memoir written by the great man himself. One should not expect too much detail, however, as the text only gives us glimpses into the man's life and the singular events that shaped who he was and what he became and, more importantly, what he accomplished. Schweitzer focuses mainly on the development of his theological and philosophical thought, beginning with his early endeavours leading to his famous work, `The Quest for the Historical Jesus'. From this point, he continues on towards the shaping of his magnum opus, `Philosophy of Civilization'. It is in this section of the text that he discusses two worldviews of life-affirmation and life-denial and pessimism. This work evolves into his philosophical perspective of Reverence for Life.<br />The biography ends in the year 1931, well before the advent of the Second World War. Schweitzer was only fifty-six years of age when he penned this work, well before receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, living and working for another forty-four years. Curiously, when his publisher requested that he write an autobiography, he was hesitant, as he was more or less still in his prime. However, as he wrote to his publisher fourteen years later on his seventieth birthday, memory fades with age, and he believed that writing about himself at that stage of his life, he could put down those important memories that remained fresh in his mind.<br />Schweitzer is certainly an inspiration - a man of immense strength, physically, emotionally and spiritually, with an almost endless capacity for work. The man worked in the most difficult of circumstances. Practicing medicine in intense tropical heat, day after day, disease run rampant; constant worry over funds to purchase much needed medical supplies. Moreover, the terrible events of two world wars - the odds he worked against to maintain the Lambarene Hospital, to my mind, is simply unimaginable. But the man persisted, rising every morning to meet disease, suffering, violence, death and loneliness.<br />This is an inspiring little book, charming and entertaining.violence, death and loneliness.<br />This is an inspiring little book, charming and entertaining.	2003-12-09

This is a fine biography of one of the greatest humanitarians of the twentieth century. During his lifetime, (ninety years) Schweitzer the great man transformed into Schweitzer the great myth; the great white hope, saving the bodies and souls of the primitive black man of Africa. In our post colonial age, with its post modern, abstract cultural theories of the `other', Schweitzer became an easy target for cultural critics, using the man and his work as representative of everything evil about the self-perceived superiority of Western man over `primitive cultures'. It is without question, that, for the most part, European imperialism justified their greedy exploitation of developing countries as efforts to `civilize' them. Our culture, knowledge and religion were superior to these `savages', and while we stole their natural resources, we gave them enlightenment. Further to this, however, as we stole and enlightened, we also gave them our diseases, which, in some cases, virtually wiped out entire peoples. From the very beginning, Albert Schweitzer was aware of the European's injustices to these people, and deeply felt some kind of atonement or restitution had to be made.  Schweitzer's intention was to essentially help; his inspiring example paved the way for present humanitarian organizations to make a difference or at least become more effective in their aid. This biography successfully dismantles the `great white hope' myth, and presents the man as an insightful critic of Western values and traditional theology, a man who lived his philosophy - or as Schweitzer said, \\"Live his argument\\". One can never truly understand or judge someone based on what they say or what they write; only through the results of a person's actions can we really know them. Marshall and Poling's biography of Schweitzer includes his writing and many quotes from conversations and interviews, but argue his greatness from the stand point of his actions. In other words, his fifty years of service and the establishment of the Lambarene hospital, speaks for itself.<br />Schweitzer became aware of his mission to serve his fellow travellers on this planet somewhat late in life. An established philosopher and theologian at age thirty, a principal of a respected seminary, he awoke one morning to realize everything life had given him, and it was time to give back. After reading an article calling for trained medical staff to work in West Africa, he knew what he needed to do. Against heavy opposition from family and friends, he returned to university as a mature-aged student to study medicine, attaining his degree. The public know much about his early life but as his daughter, Rhena Schweitzer, writes in the Forward, \\"It is the first biography that gives an account of the last years of my fathers live. It helps explain and dissipates some of the false ideas about his relationship to the Africans.\\" This book dispels these falsehoods and myths, and is also a sensitive and objective appraisal of a man and his life.<br />An inspiring read.nd the establishment of the Lambarene hospital, speaks for itself.<br />Schweitzer became aware of his mission to serve his fellow travellers on this planet somewhat late in life.

What makes Greene not a good writer but a great one is his ability to universalize his characters, representing expressions of general political and national views of a particular historical time. When this novel was first published in 1955, the Vietnam situation was no more than a tiny blip on the international radar. A French colony for many years, after the enforced removal of the Japanese at the end of the war, the French intended all to return to what the country was before, a French dominion. In fact, before WW2, South East Asia was predominantly a Dutch and French colony, and these European imperialists requested of the then newly formed United Nations to ratify their intentions for the region to remain under their colonial rule. But the Cold War was now in full swing, and the evil red menace began spreading her claws. They had to be stopped or so we were told. After Korea, Vietnam was the focus point for the U.S. to stop the spread of Communism. The `Domino Theory' was given as a reason for U.S. involvement - if one country fell to the Reds, other countries would naturally follow suit. In hindsight, we now know this theory not to be entirely true. The political situation in Vietnam was much more complicated than the communists verses the free world, and this short though elegantly written novel explores some of these complications through its main characters.<br />It would be redundant to launch into a detailed sketch of the main characters and the plot for that matter, however, what this story essentially examines, is that at some time or another, as human beings, we have to make a stand for what we believe in. Eventually we have to choose sides, take responsibility for our decision and cop the inevitable consequences. In this case, the narrator, a cynical, urbane, English atheist, Thomas Fowler, cannot remain in the middle of a major conflict, having created emotional attachments, and sit on the fence. It takes an event of tragedy to push him over the edge, but once moved, he acts. And as his subsequent actions are dire, there is no turning back.<br />The real beauty of this novel is it straightforward, even style, giving the reader the option simply to enjoy the surface tale, or delve deeper into its important issues. ~The Quiet American~ is one of the great twentieth century novels., but once moved, he acts.

It seems to be human nature to bring down those we perceive as successful people. In Australia we have a term for this habit - The Tall Poppy Syndrome. If the plant is seen to be towering over the rest of the crop, our first inclination is to cut its head off, bringing it down to an acceptable level along with the rest of us. The subject and author of this excellent biography is one of the most successful artists in the last twenty years. And its no surprise that the man has experienced some heavy criticism over this time, and the fiercest attempted decapitations have come from Sting's home ground, the British tabloids. Sting is an accomplished and award winning musician, lyricist, songwriter, poet, actor and a sincere environmental activist. He has more money than he knows what to do with, (somewhere in the vicinity of $ 200 million) and now at the crest of a new album, (Sacred Love) he publishes an autobiography, a memoir, about his childhood and musical journey to international stardom. Considering this man's incredible success, I went into the reading with a hint of trepidation, my tall poppy scythe firm in hand - would this memoir be a gloating exercise, another `success story' with the usual tired anecdotes and prosaic self-deprecating questions - \\"Why me? I'm just a regular guy like the rest of you.\\" Let me just say that this biography was an enormous surprise and one exceptional read.<br />The narrative begins with Sting's controversial experience in South America, where he ingested an ancient medicine, used predominately by a Christian syncretic group, known as Ayahuasca.  He describes this experience in atmospheric detail and the various visions he witnessed during the religious ceremony. Sting's prose is quite accomplished throughout the book. For example, the actual scene from his religious experience:<br />\\"The entire room seems to be gripped in this visceral struggle. Some writhe in their seats, others have clearly capitulated, open-mouthed and corpselike, while others seem calm and transfixed as if by beatific visions. Then, as a bizarre counterpoint to the call of the thunder, the retching begins.\\"  (P.9)<br />This incredible experience irrevocably changed the man, and by his own account, he really hasn't viewed the world in the same way since. From this religious experience in the jungles of Brazil, he invites us to take part in a reflective journey about his childhood and his discovery of music. There is an irrefutable honesty in this book. His feelings about his friends, colleagues, lovers, parents and his response to the various deaths of loved ones, was at once moving and acutely sensitive without a hint of sentimentality.<br />This is a book that all Sting and Police fans should read, as it reveals insights into the man and the artist in an honest, elegant and entertaining manner.

This enchanting book examines the deep influence of Zen Buddhism on the central aspects of Japanese culture and gracefully illustrates that the two are linked in profound ways. Suzuki has that mysterious ability as a writer to explain extremely abstract notions in elegant though simplistic language. Zen is a difficult subject to demonstrate because, by its very nature, it defies normative modes of rational thought.<br />Suzuki manages to gently clear our rationally conditioned patterns of thought like a gentle spring rain, and astonishingly we come to discover that Zen is simpler than anything else we've encountered before. One comes away from the reading with a soothing, calm and certain understanding of the nature of Zen. And one is certain that the man behind the words is a master.<br />He begins the narrative with insightful remarks on Japanese culture, touching on Zen's history and how the military classes, the Samurai, embraced the religion. The discussion moves onto Zen and its relation to Confucianism and the connection with the cultivation of a nationalistic spirit in Japan. The majority of the text is devoted to three central areas: Zen and Swordsmanship, Zen and Haiku, Zen and the Art of Tea, and lastly, the Japanese love of nature and its manifestations through art.<br />Suzuki's argument is that Zen and its teachings have had such an enormous influence on the Japanese, that the culture as we know it would not exist without it. One needs to truly understand this influence in order to have any comprehension of the culture. He proposes that one does not exist without the other:<br />\\"...without a full appreciation of it not a page of the history of Japanese poetry, Japanese arts, and Japanese handicrafts would have been written. Not only the history of the arts, but the history of the Japanese moral and spiritual life would lose its deeper significance, if detached from the Zen way of interpreting life and the world.\\" (P.364)<br />This is an extraordinary book because it opens the way towards a fundamental understanding of Zen Buddhism and the foundations of Japanese culture, illustrating that the two are inextricably interlinked. The text is also beautifully enhanced with poetry, paintings, calligraphy and examples of architecture. If one is interested in either of these subjects, this book is a masterpiece and an important and enlightening experience.book because it opens the way towards a fundamental understanding of Zen Buddhism and the foundations of Japanese culture, illustrating that the two are inextricably interlinked.

This is a fair study on the life of Burton though it really doesnt shed any new light on this extraordinary individual, other than psychoanalytic musings on his childhood, grasping at the reasons behind his motivations for his in-depth studies on sex, his neurotic drive to be constantly on the move, his marriage and relationships. The texts major flaw is this particular approach to the subject; (that intellectual sixties trend of psychoanalysing the dead) reinforcing the myth that Burton was the stereotypical Victorian, demonstrating all the biases, racism and limited view of the world that we associate with this stereotype. This man goes way beyond the Victorian model and certainly transcends Freudian flights of fancy. If you can ignore McLynns psychological method, this biography is a welcome addition to Burton studies.<br />R.F. Burton is a difficult study because there are so many sides to the man. In fact one can certainly classify him as a phenomenon. He was a linguist of genius, and there are scholars who claim he was the linguist of the 19th century: a poet, scholar, soldier, archaeologist, anthropologist, Master swordsman, mystic and genuine seeker of the Divine. As a sexologist he anticipated Freud, and sought to open the subject of study against typical Victorian opposition. His writings occasionally indulge in the common racism of the times, though his observations and comments of unknown cultures and particular characters in those cultures can be insightful and sympathetic. Similar to most individuals of depth and genius, Burton was a contradiction, and this biography more than displays these contradictions.<br />The psychoanalytic technique to delve into a subject can be questioned. As one writer has said, it is difficult enough to rely on the results of psychoanalysis in writing about a live person, let a lone a dead one, with no opportunity to respond to allegations such as misogynist, self-destructive type and latent homosexual. To use this technique, distilling this fascinating man down to a Freudian case study is a disservice to the man and his work. However, as stated above, if you can side step these useless speculations, that really doesnt reveal anything new about the man, this biography is informative and worth looking into.que, distilling this fascinating man down to a Freudian case study is a disservice to the man and his work.

In a time of peace, at the end of the Tokugawa regime, (1603-1867), the Samurai extended their duties into the administrative class, developing from mere 'attendants' to philosophers, scholars, physicians, and teachers, creating concise systems of mental and moral training. This class influenced the country's culture in profound ways, which continues to be felt and seen in modern day Japan. Fearing that the Samurai would lose their basic purpose and essential character, author Taira Shigesuke, (1639-1730) a Confucian scholar, wrote this handbook for the novice knight. For the beginning knight, this book would have been indispensable, in terms of conducting oneself in the true spirit of the Samurai.<br />The book is structured in three parts, including subjects ranging from education, familial duty, frugality, courtesy and respect, laziness, discretion to military service, vassalage and loyalty to dealing with one's superiors. What is so valuable about this book for the modern western reader is that it provides age-old ethical guidelines that are exceedingly practical and relevant to the present day.<br />Central to the Samurai philosophy is the notion of concerning oneself daily with death. Shigesuke emphasises from the outset, that, \\"As long as you keep death in mind at all times, you will also fulfil the ways of loyalty and familial duty.\\" In other words, everything else follows from this basic attitude - a long life, and a character that will improve and virtue that will grow. This makes sense, of course, because as the author points out, when you think your time here will last, you're inclined to take it for granted, thereby saying things you shouldn't say and letting important matters slide because \\"...it can always be done tomorrow.\\"<br />This powerful little book is as compelling and relevant as it was over 400 hundred years ago. It will not take more than an hour to read, but its contents hold treasures that should be referred back to in order to remind one that life is short and should never be taken for granted.

Since WW2, most European countries use English as a second language and therefore are accommodating to the ignorant visitor. In other terms, one can 'get by' without too much confusion or fuss. A few years ago, on my way to the U.S. to visit friends and family, I made a two-day stop over in Japan.  Because of my limited stay and time constraints, I chose not to do any research on the language and culture. This was a big mistake. The reason being is that Japan's culture - behaviour, customs and attitudes are so different to Western modes of living. My two-day stop over was a personal disaster for many reasons. If only I had done at least a little research, my short time in Japan would have been much more meaningful. ~The Japanese Way~ is a gem of a text that covers the essentials for any one to successfully 'get by' while visiting this fascinating country.<br />This text is a crucial reference to the most common aspects of the culture to the more specific traits in Japan's social framework. In the contents page is a list of 89 subjects ranging from body language and gestures to gender roles and business cards. For example, taking a taxi in Tokyo can be expensive and sometimes frustrating because the address system, house numbers, are not assigned according to grid location or position on a specific street. The buildings are grouped in blocks and are numbered according to the time in which they were built! Requesting a specific residential home, in other words, is an exasperating exercise and most of the time the driver will not be able to find it. (The lesson learned here is to purchase a map and use public transport.) This text also provides the basics in language - Hellos and Goodbyes and some basic rules on politeness and rudeness. These basic phrases and suggested approach to social situations are invaluable, even if you're only planning a short visit.<br />If you're planning to travel to Japan sometime in the future, I highly recommend this invaluable book, because it literally covers just about everything you will need to know to ensure your stay is fulfilling, memorable and problem free.situations are invaluable, even if you're only planning a short visit.<br />If you're planning to travel to Japan sometime in the future, I highly recommend this invaluable book, because it literally covers just about everything you will need to know to ensure your stay is fulfilling, memorable and problem free.	2003-10-11
US	45814424	R1TL96SYF6RFDY	0345311809	384709649	Shibumi	Books	5	186	195	N	N	Modern medieval anti-hero of the establishment.	When this novel was first published in 1979, the leading critics had a difficult time classifying the work. It wasn't exactly an espionage thriller or an epic, but it seemed to touch upon many genres and themes. ~Shibumi~ is a fictional biography more than anything else, for its central character, Nicholai Hel, is the tale's main concern. A minor character in the story sums up the protagonist superbly at the end of the book by calling him half saintly ascetic, half Vandal marauder - a medieval anti-hero. Nicholai Hel is your vintage 'man-against-the establishment' with a mind like a steel trap and the tastes and lifestyle of an 18th century aristocrat. His pedigree is a throw back to the German/Russian elite,  where generations of breeding and culture have contributed to his unusual character. Nicholai is a man without a country, a natural mystic, philosopher, linguist, master of Go, a complex Japanese board game of high strategy, and most importantly, a self trained assassin for hire who is expert in the arts of naked/kill. More than this, he is a seeker of spiritual perfection, his ultimate goal being that hard to define state or condition known as Shibumi.<br />Trevanian (Rodney Whitaker) is a first rate writer. His technical skill in the craft well exceeds many leading 'thriller' writers of today. When one reads about the art of naked/kill, the mystical states of Nicholai Hel, or even the machinations of the CIA and their unscrupulous methods for creating and combating terror, one gets the distinct impression that the author knows exactly what he's talking about and must have access to some kind of inside information. His writing is almost too believable. Throughout the reading, I had to continue to remind myself that this novel was written in 1979, well before the general public had any concern about terrorism. Other than the main character, this tale is about corruption in governments, who will go to any lengths to secure oil rights in the Middle East. The book is also about technology, which has aided civilization in many ways, yet has eroded our basic values. In many respects, Nicholai Hel is a modern Luddite, despising machines in all their forms, and the waste they create. Nicholai Hel is an 'everyman' character, a representation of the virtuous individual, alone and pitted against the dangerous technological and consumerist values of the herd. In the end, however, does Nicholai Hel win this battle over the modern, vulgar, techno-centred majority and finally attain 'Shibumi'?<br />This work should be considered a classic, for it has a timelessness about it, and can be read many times, for it will continue to offer intellectual stimulation as well as pure entertainment for many years to come.ok is also about technology, which has aided civilization in many ways, yet has eroded our basic values.

This insightful text is an elegantly written introduction to Gnosticism and a simple though comprehensive appraisal of the Dead Sea Scrolls, found by a goat herder in 1947, and the Nag Hammadi Library that was discovered by two peasants in 1945 in Upper Egypt. These writings are contemporary with the canonical biblical texts, which illustrate a different perspective of what constitutes the spiritual life, and the teachings of Jesus Christ. These works have been branded heretical because their message in some ways, contradicts the orthodoxy of the reigning Church. Taking the word `heresy' in the literal sense, meaning to take the position in opposition to the orthodoxy of the time, the Nag Hammadi texts are indeed `heretical'. Hoeller not only presents the works of the Essen's (The people of the scrolls) and the Gnostic Gospels in an easy to comprehend format, but also connects these works with the depth psychology of the famous Swiss psychiatrist, C.G. Jung. What is fascinating about this connection is that Jung did not come to these materials by way of other researches and scholarship, but through a personal, direct encounter of the images and myths themselves. If you are interested in how Jung came upon this material by way of self-analysis and `active imagining', read his autobiographical text, `Memories, Dreams and Reflections.' Jung's approach to healing the psyche and teachings of the Gnostics are strikingly similar; this method towards the spiritual life is not based on following a particular dogma or the way of `faith', but through experience of Self and the divine.<br />There are numerous paths towards enlightenment and the Divine. In my personal experience, one perspective is not necessarily more `true' than another...faith in the divine and the practice of good works is but one path; believing in the biblical canon in a literal sense, on face value, has aided many an individual out of the depths of despair and has set them on the road to living a meaningful and spiritual existence. But for some individuals, faith is not enough. To the Gnostic, the notion or phenomenon of experience takes precedence over metaphysical speculation or literal faith in the Gospels that have been handed down to us from the traditional Church. What the American philosopher William James described as \\"faith in someone else's faith\\" does not provide spiritual meaning for a lot people. Some of us hunger for a direct experience or vision of the Divine, and this is what the Gnostic scriptures advise us to do. By truly knowing oneself, one can discover God.<br />In the last chapter of this text, `From Hiroshima to the Secret Gospels', the author warns of the current condition of our age, in terms of the potential annihilation of the entire planet with our weapons of mass destruction. This is not some rhetorical `scare tactic' or apocalyptic ranting, but a genuine call for us to take a close look at ourselves, the darl sides of our natures, and to make a concerted effort to heal.

US	45814424	R3VI8WQTY878MC	0786708964	723656217	Beasts	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Subtle though provocative	This intense and brilliantly written novella by America's most prolific author in the last fifty years, strikes with tasteful subtlety, the darker aspects of human nature. The text is also an examination of exploitation and seduction, used by those in a position of power and authority, the opportunity to satisfy their perverse desires. One is reminded that education and 'class' has nothing to do with morality. The SS, for example, would drink expensive wine, listening to recordings of Mozart and Schubert, while Jews mercilessly burned, just outside their windows. Education and good breeding does not equate to living the ethical good life. As history has shown, Plato was wrong. Evil is a separate issue to education; it presents in many forms.<br />~Beasts~ is a provocative tale about an inexperienced university student in the seventies who falls in love with her literature professor - an arrogant, bohemian literary type, that vomits clich&eacute;s about the works of D.H. Lawrence and Fredric Nietzsche, but to a young girl, opens whole new vistas to the world of literature. The professor is married also to an unconventional French artist, whose derivative, aboriginal/erotic sculptures, has caused violent responses from the town folk's middle class sensibilities. This couple is unique, relative to their surroundings, which draw hungry for experience adolescent schoolgirls' into their elite though sordid lair. What scintillating and dark pleasures reside within their mysterious domain?<br />I've always believed that the mark of a good writer is the ability to communicate sensational subject matter in quiet, understated prose, thereby doubling the affect on the unsuspecting reader. Oates's control of her art form is clearly expressed in ~Beasts~; she combines Gothic nuances with psychological insight and makes you believe every word.  This was a pleasure to read.	2003-09-26

One becomes suspicious upon discovering an Apology at the beginning of a work of popular fiction. In this case, the author reminds the reader that the work their about to embark on is a work of fiction, and that his criticisms are merely poetic licence, tools to carry the story along. Burdett borders on obsequiousness in his efforts to justify his portrayal of the Royal Thai Police Force. Strangely, most people with knowledge of world affaires are aware of corruption in these sectors, and warnings from travel agencies and home governments before travelling to South East Asia, is common practice. However, after reading this entertaining novel, to my surprise, Burdett's apologies were misplaced. He certainly presents the Thai police force as corrupt, but in a light that justifies this system as somehow workable and much less hypocritical than our Western system. In fact, for all his criticisms of America, his Apology should have been directed at Western society in general, as he presents American's as consumerist, puritan, insensitive, greedy and inept. To make an apology before presenting your creative endeavours, really show's that the artist is extremely insecure about their creation. Art should stand on its own without pre-emptive explanations and apologies regarding its subject matter.<br />These criticisms aside, ~Bangkok 8~ is a crime thriller from an Eastern perspective. For this genre, telling a crime story from Buddhist eyes, including and using the tenets from this religion to solve the mystery, is indeed a fresh approach. Our narrator, Detective Sonchai Jiteecheap, is an `arhat', a Buddhist who is a `...fully realized (person), who voluntarily pauses on the shore of nirvana, postponing their total release in order to teach wisdom.' In other words, a holy man, who must workout his remaining karmic lessons, before their final step into the abyss. Jiteecheap is a likable character, despite his arrogance and evident sense of superiority over Westerner's, particularly his FBI assigned partner, Kimberly Jones. Unfortunately, the Jones character is presented as a cardboard cutout, representing the modern American woman as ambitious, exclusively right-brained, Anglo-centred and crass. I found Burdett's conscious perpetuation of Western and Eastern stereotypes extremely annoying. As a reader of this novel, if you can somehow ignore the stereotypes and sociological biases, concentrating on the mystery itself, the book is an entertaining read.icularly his FBI assigned partner, Kimberly Jones.

Proust plunges the reader into the world of his vivid imagination, traversing between memory, image and objective reality. His work is truly a reflection or refraction of perception, to then be reconstructed in descriptive prose that conjures enchanting visuals of paradisaical landscapes, childhood wishes and dreams, and a time forgotten or lost as the modern age came crashing in with the arrival of the twentieth century. In the last pages of ~Swann's Way~, one cannot help but feel his lament of times passed, when women dressed with unconscious elegance, the French countryside remained pure, and the sheer simplicity and sophistication of the horse drawn carriage. These times are truly lost, however the narrator speculates, '...remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a particular moment...held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life.' When the narrator remembers, he realises that what he has known no longer exists, or possibly never existed, but they most certainly exist in his memories.<br />This constant play between perception through the senses, the idealized image, and their interaction, and the character's responses to this constant flux of the real and the imagined, is the central theme of this text. The central character of the second chapter, Swann in Love, is hopelessly seduced by the coquettish, Odette. She draws Swann into her world and, over time, her indifference and listlessness, her unpredictable irritability and at times chilly manner towards him, causes Swann to suffer. But the reader gets the impression that Swann tends towards masochism, and in a perverse way, enjoys the pain. Swann's taste in women has always tended towards those below his social station - the shopgirl, the worker's daughter or the prostitute. These liaisons are always carried out in secret for the obvious reasons. However, in spite of Odette's lack of education and birthright, the aristocratic male finds her extremely attractive. She is a mistress with natural class and possesses that necessary skill of discretion. But is Swann actually in love with Odette, or the idealized image? When the actual woman and the idealized one do not meet, his expectations are dashed and he continues to suffer. Swann's friends anonymously attempt to tell him about Odette's seedy past, but this action only further embeds him into his reserve to somehow return to the pure love they once shared. And so the tale continues...<br />This is the first book of Proust's seven-volume magnum opus, A la recherch&eacute; du temps perdu. To my mind, the second section, 'Combray', is the most sensitive and beautiful description of early youth in modern literature. The last chapter is a kind of poetic lament of that innocent time period before the ravages of the Great War, which irrevocably changed the world forever. One cannot sing the praises of this novel enough.th natural class and possesses that necessary skill of discretion. But is Swann actually in love with Odette, or the idealized image?

On one level, the author's intentions are at best quite disturbing, because the texts theme has definite anti-social undertones. Deception, manipulation, exploitation of peoples weaknesses to achieve selfish ends has no moralistic value whatsoever; in fact the whole idea of preying on a 'victims' weaknesses in order to position them within your power, to then sexually dominate and influence them to your wiles and wishes, is a deplorable concept anyway you view it. Then again, from another perspective, the numerous techniques of seduction that Green instructs the reader on, supplying a plethora of examples from history and Western and Eastern literature, can teach us to be wary, or at least aware of certain individuals unscrupulous methods to attain what they desire. As the old saying goes, \\"Better the devil you know, than the one you don't.\\"<br />The lessons on seduction, at bottom, can really only work if one's targeted victim has some weakness or vulnerability of character. (Green warns to stay away from confident, grounded individuals) Through subtly stalking your intended victim, listening to their every word, stroking their ego, thus discovering their weakness, you can then supply the necessary requirement, whether it be excitement, adventure, danger, loving parenting, add a little time and patience, your victim will eventually fall under your spell. This particular strategy of discovering weakness, focusing on needs, and appealing to an individual's ego, is as old as the pyramids themselves. What's interesting, however, is that this strategy works and continues to be used by individuals and organizations everywhere - but we continue to fall for the scam. And do not be fooled by Green's language and impressive erudite examples from the great works of literature - a scam is a scam no matter how you communicate it.<br />The text itself is a play on seduction. Green uses the two most seductive and sought after aspects of our existence to reel us into his tutorial: sex and power. None of us want to be victims, in fact we all want to dominate, be the winners, gratify our base and exalted desires. Do you want to unknowingly be seduced or be the seducer? The answer, of course, is evident. Green knows this and uses this strategy by proposing that he can give us an edge, supplying the means to attain our every desire.<br />In the end, after reading this text from cover to cover, I asked myself the question, what did I learn? What I learned is that certain individuals and organizations will go to any lengths, ethically or otherwise, to dominate others and get what they want. All things considered, it is better to know than to not know, no matter how unsavoury the subject matter.after aspects of our existence to reel us into his tutorial: sex and power.

The argument is essentially a battle over what constitutes 'real' knowledge. This is an epistemological conflict between the rational, irrational and the spiritual. Religion has provided guidance, morality and hope in a predominately meaningless existence. However, in modern times, our faith in a power greater than ourselves has waned considerably, particularly in traditional religions. Our new God is science. Or so the argument proposes. Science has given us means to heal the sick on a grand scale and like never before. Technology has given us the means to feed an entire planet, though ironically, the powers that be choose other ways to use this knowledge. The vast majority of the planet continues to starve. The further irony, though, is that since the renaissance, religion and science have been pitted against each other in a play for power over the undiscerning masses. The arguments in each camp are certainly compelling. ~Angels and Demons~ addresses this argument in a modern context.<br />Those of you who have been fortunate enough to read, 'The Da Vinci Code', another Dan Brown thriller, will be acquainted with the lead character, Robert Langdon. As a Harvard art historian and expert of ancient symbols, the CEO of the largest and most important science facility in the world contacts him. A gruesome murder has been committed. One of the lead scientists has been found dead with a grisly brand burned into his chest. Langdon is reluctant to get involved until a fax is sent to him of the murder scene. Branded on the victims chest is an ancient symbol that read: 'Illuminati'. What draws Langdon in is that the symbol is an ambigram, a perfectly symmetrical word that can be read both ways. Academics had been arguing for centuries over this very symbol's existince. And as an expert on the Illuminati, Langdon knows that they were and are the sworn enemies of the Chatholic Church.<br />What is surprising about this novel is that Brown has managed to bring together a huge subject into a highly entertaining read. Another reviewer called him a juggler of disparate themes though he doesn't drop a ball. This novel is a riveting read with many switches and turns from start to finish. This is five star material.rising about this novel is that Brown has managed to bring together a huge subject into a highly entertaining read.

Dr. John Dee is now considered to be the English Renaissance man. This was not always the case, however, because his first biographers, as the author of this fine biography points out, were either `hard-headed rationalist or muddle-headed mystics.' In present time, researchers and historians agree that Dee was a true Renaissance man because he sought to connect or reconcile rationalism with magic, science and the supernatural. This was not unusual for the time. Copernicus cited the mystic Hermes Trismegistus in his Magnum Opus, proposing the heliocentric universe. Isaac Newton began his career as an alchemist, before moving on to modern methods of pure science. John Dee was the most important scientists of the Elizabethan age. But this is only a somewhat recent recognition because throughout the ages he was considered a charlatan, crook, blockhead and \\"companion of hellhounds\\". Benjamin Woolley's fine biography combines history, science, espionage and common sense and attempts to answer how a man of genius that had such a major influence in mathematics, astronomy, cartography, navigation and science in general, could die a pauper and in obscurity.<br />In 1659, a scholar by the name of Meric Casaubon copied and published a collection of Dee's documents, which contained the recordings of spiritual conversations with angels and archangels, and other dialogues, which could be interpreted dubious at best. After the publication Dee's reputation as a credible philosopher went steadily down hill and has taken centuries to recover. Woolley has done some fine research, using Dee's actual diaries, and has painstakingly pieced together his life and career.<br />The Elizabethan age was a turning point in Western history. The Reformation was essentially a battle for power and knowledge and a bloody war in the name of religion. But it also set the stage for the Enlightenment, and Dr. John Dee was a precursor to the Age of Reason. He was a man of `science', collecting and studying every ancient text he could get his hands on, (his library is the stuff of legend) but rational knowledge, he truly believed, would only take him so far - he desired heavenly knowledge and wisdom. And it is possible that his spiritual researches into the divine nature could have been the cause of his downfall. Dee did not seek worldly gain, riches and material pleasure; his only desire was to attain the secrets of the Holy. Did he pay the ultimate price for this activity?<br />~The Queen's Conjurer~ is not a dense historical text, but an informative and enlightening piece of research.

But who is this legendary figure that captured the attention of queens, popes, poets, mystics and men of science? The mystic and poet, William Blake, painted and wrote about the man; Catharine the Great was motivated to banish him from her realm; Mozart included him in his operatic masterpiece, The Magic Flute; Goethe despised him though claimed Cagliostro as inspiration for his epic poem, Faust. He was famous throughout Europe as a great healer - and testaments to this fact ran into the thousands. At the same time, however, he was known as one of the greatest con men that ever traversed the continent in the eighteenth century. Iain McCalman's new book about this famous though mysterious figure of the Enlightenment, gives us an entertaining and unbiased account of the man in the context of seven `ordeals' during his life.<br />Giuseppe Balsamo (Cagliostro) was born in Palermo, and quickly learned the ways of the street, travelling later to the exotic lands of Cairo and Alexandria, soaking in their culture, to then become a kind of servant, or donat, with the Knights Hospitallers of Saint John. It is here he was made a member of the order, allegedly learning the many secrets of the ancients. Originally he learned the basics of apothecary in his native land, but furthered his education in the grand alchemical laboratories of the order. Cagliostro was a Freemason, but more particularly a leading proponent of the Egyptian Rite of Freemasonry. As an initiated member of the powerful order of the Knights of Malta, this was his passport into the many powerful realms of Europe.<br />This short sketch of the man does not take a concrete position as to whether Cagliostro was a scoundrel or a saint, a black or white magician, a man of God or of the devil. McCalman gives us the story as a true journalist might when all the facts are not at their disposal. The text presents the subject in a manner that leaves it to the reader to decide on the true character of the man. To be sure, Cagliostro was the essence of contradiction - healing hundreds of people one day and scheming the next. This, of course, is what makes him fascinating. However, men of genius usually are enigmas, and as historical figures, it is the purpose of historians to discover the facts.  And in a lot of cases, finding the true story is close to the impossible.<br />McCalman has done a fine job of presenting us with a known difficult subject, rife with myth, half-truths and innuendo, in such an entertaining, clear and instructive manner.

Most of us know the things in life that are preventing us from reaching our true potential. Then again, some of us simply don't care. However, after reading this highly informative book, I discovered that there are a few areas in life that required attention - absurdly simple areas, such as basics for caring for one and one's home and possessions. It astonishes how a dirty car, a non-existent filing system and a messy cloths closet can have such a negative affect on one's life. Thomas Leonard brings these apparently non-important basics to your attention and coaches in a friendly manner, gently instructing us to do something about it.<br />The text offers 28 strategies in 28 chapters, including numerous tests that help you to reflect on your current state or condition, and simple step-by-step guidelines to change your current condition for the better. The key notion in his strategy is to make oneself more attractive by living a fulfilling life. Rather than `strive' and `hard sell' your way to success, his method is more along the lines of taking the path of least resistance - that by being aware and sensitive to oneself and one's environment, you create an attitude of mind where living and success becomes almost effortless. His method more or less has a Zen quality to it - surrendering to the Tao and moving through life in a natural way. In other words, by attaining clarity of mind, one is more in a position to recognize opportunities when they present themselves, and because we have become more ourselves and in-flow with our environment, good things will happen. Put in other terms; remove the physical and emotional clutter in your life, thereby creating the space for success to occur.<br />It is impossible for a single self-help book to be the answer for everybody.

After tours in Vietnam and some twenty-eight years with the LAPD, the man has managed to retain his humanity without the slightest hint of cynicism, though his realistic view of the world might be mistaken as such. As Harry states in the novel, it's difficult to let go of the job after so many years. But there are some cases, unsolved cases that refuse to go away, there must be closure. Bosch knows who he is - this sounds like a cliche, but the man knows his place in the world, and to maintain his integrity, he must follow his calling, or in Harry's words, his mission. Like the job, and relationships, he's come to realize that there's no turing back. Everything has a connection, and when he ponders on these things he knows \\"there is no end of things in the heart\\". Thus the story begins.<br />Michael Connelly writes in a straightforward style, no over writing here, but just enough to draw you in and keep you there until the last page. This is just plain good story telling. There's no effort here to razzle-dazzle the reader with attempts at originality. This novel is a believable case with true to life characters that are interesting in their own right. His plotting is tight and the pace moves well, dragging the reader along effortlessly. ~Lost Light~ is a wonderful metaphor for the City of Angels - Los Angeles. The older natives of this strange and extraordinary city at least, including Harry, look back on it as having lost something. But even in the shadows, one can catch glimmers of the lost light, shining in the darkness.<br />This is modern crime writing that will exceed your expectations. If you have become bored with gratuitous hype and needless special effects, read ~Lost Light~ it bring us back to reality and reminds us of what a good story should be. Excellent.	2003-07-03

Shah becomes obsessed with the tale of the Queen of Sheba and her relationship with King Solomom. While in the holy city of Jerusalem, he purchases an old map from a dubious shopkeeper. The map points to the mysterious country of Ethiopia, the land that allegedly possesses the prized Ark of the Covenant. He then takes on the quest to find the legendary city of Ophir, the ancient home of Makeda, the Queen of Sheba. It is this location that King Solomon's mines might have existed. In the Ethiopian holy text, Kebra Negast, (The Glory of Kings) tells the story in full of Sheba's relationship with the wise king, their exchange of unimaginable riches, and the theft of the Ark, which supposedly still resides in the city of Axum. Shah begins his journey in this mysterious and misunderstood country, experiencing many hardships, adventures and disappointments along the way.<br />Tahir Shah is a walking-talking anachronism - as he models himself after the great explorers of the 19th century - Stanley, Burton and Livingston. He has that dogged-persistence and general Romantic spirit of the old explorers, which makes this text inspiring and enormously entertaining. The book contains a myriad of strange characters that have many unusual, funny and macabre stories to tell. Shah's central guide, Samson, an Ethiopian taxi driver and devout Christian, reluctantly accompanies our narrator to the end, and the reader will empathize with Samson because of his many hardships throughout the journey. Then there is Bahra, the 'qat' consuming Somalian, who chauffers Shah and Samson around Ethiopia for most of the trip. Close to the end of the journey, Bahra simply stops the truck, claiming adamantly that 'his luck has run out' and simply refuses to go any further. This proves to be extremely frustrating for Shah, and totally hilarious, but there's nothing he can do about it, and must leave the man behind.<br />Most Westerner's usually think of Ethiopia as a barren, dusty desert. Surprisingly, though, we discover that parts of the country are rich in vegetation and quite beautiful. However Ethiopia ia a developing country and one is constantly reminded of this with Shah's descriptions of the people's general living conditions. This is an irony because the country still, after thousands of years of mining, continues to be rich in gold deposits. The big question is who is benefiting from this wealth, because it certainly isn't the common people?<br />This is an extraordinary modern adventure that rings of the 19th century Romantic traditon. Shah writes with enthusiasm and wit and makes one envious of his adventurous spirit. Excellent reading.as a barren, dusty desert.

The subject matter that they attempt to address is tastelessly watered-down to the point of absurdity, placing serious topics such as philosophy and political thought into a superficial pop culture context. The subjects are so scandoulsly generalized that the reader comes away from the text more confused than before the reading. On the other hand, there is the view that this series presents precise introductions to otherwise dense material, paving the way for further study. My opinion tends towards the latter, because these texts are in fact precise, honing down the ideas in a language that can be understood by intelligent people with a desire to understand the subject under discussion. In ~Philosophy~ a vast amount of material is touched on from the pre-Socratics to Derrida's post structuralism. A ambitious project, but Richard Osbourne along with Ralph Edney as illustrator has managed to pull it off with accuracy, humour and elegance.<br />This publication is not presenting itself as anything else other than what it is - an overview of western philosophy from the early Greeks to present time. Having some background in philosophy, personally the sections on the Dark Ages, Holy Roman Empire, and the rise of Scholasticism in the first millennia was informative, reminding me of the huge influence St Thomas Aquinas had at the time - his famous 'Summa contra Gentiles', which set out to prove to non Christians, through natural reason, the importance of Chrisianity and the existence of God. Interestingly, the author's at the end of the Aquinas section comment that the explanation concerning the philosopher's thought was a bit &quot;sketchy, but it's only a Beginner's Guide.&quot; This was a subtle cue from the author's that this text is in fact only an introduction and not to expect much more.<br />This book is an appropriate beginning to a vast and complex subject. If this text sparks some interest, the bibliography at the back is divided into Introductory, Advanced and General references, including a few excellent books to read if one plans to pursue the subject further. Osborne et al, have done a terrific job of tackling such a notoriously difficult subject and making it interesting and accessible.nterest, the bibliography at the back is divided into Introductory, Advanced and General references, including a few excellent books to read if one plans to pursue the subject further.

In this case, however, the murderer is a master of deception, a talented magician who possesses all the skills of an illusionist - slight of hand, a quick-change artist, mesmerist and escapologist. The killer uses all his skills to keep Rhyme and Sachs off the track until the very end. If you think its all been done before, that is, serial killers who devise unique methods to slaughter their prey - think again. This killer is a performance murderer, destroying his victims in a series of well known and not so, magical acts. The killer's greatest skill is a device known in the magical trade as 'misdirection': manipulating the audience's attention to one area while doing something else. This is what makes the killer interesting - the reader never knows where or how the killer will strike next. In this novel, Lincoln Rhyme has certainly met his match.<br />Deaver no doubt has done some thorough research here. Not only is the book a riveting read, but you also come away from the reading with a much better knowledge of the art and history of magic. And there's a lot more to it than you'd think...performance magic is a fascinating art form.<br />Jeffery Deaver knows how to write a good thriller, and his latest is a class act.	2003-06-26

In fact, the grey, gloomy skies and rain are major characters in the book. (Koontz refers to them constantly, and to great effect) We have all the ingredients for the standard thriller genre: troubled and sensitive cops, a dazzling Hollywood star, an exceedingly intelligent and evil antagonist and the constant threat of doom, hanging over the reader like the sword of Pericles, ready to drop at any moment. But ~The Face~ gives us something more than the prototype: stereotypes are brilliantly combined with the paranormal. Throughout the reading, my rational mind continued to search for logical explanations for the many strange events that happen to the main characters. To my frustration, however, no rational answers came forth because, in most cases, there weren't any. This novel makes excellent reading because what you see in not always what you expect or get...<br />The strongest aspect about the writing itself is the author's skill for characterization. Even the apparent insignificant characters in the novel have certain depth, which invokes the feeling one gets when meeting someone casually for the first time. He devotes each chapter of the tale from the perspective of each major player, and we easily enter their minds, feel their thoughts and emotions. Particularly the ten year old boy, Fric, with his pubescent humor and loneliness...and, of course, the terrifying literature professor and his Deconstructive, post modern stance on the written word. As a ruthless anarchist, he could have no better or appropriate philosophy concerning literature. This guy is truly bad without being outlandishly comic-bookish, similar to many other serial killer types in the thriller market place. Corky Laputa is just plain wicked.<br />If you're expecting the stock-standard thriller with all the tired stereotypes, you'll be disappointed with this novel. Then again, it has all the successful ingrediants one might expect, but Koontz throws in an interesting wrench into the work, which makes the book refreshing and highly enjoyable..

In a word, it is a palimpsest - a text upon which many stories are written, one on top of the other - and the task of the reader is to decipher its multifaceted, mysterious content and meaning. This great novel takes the reader by the hand and steers them through a labyrinth of emotions and ideas which all appear to contradict one another: love/violence; hope/destruction; death/humor...and still, in the end, at the book's tragic yet hopeful end, manages to bring these ideas and emotions together in a strange, organic whole. Reading this novel was an uncanny experience.<br />Auster has a gift for doing this: representing the mundane as something uncanny.<br />The protagonist, David Zimmer, a teacher of literature, finds himself confronted by the most tragic of circumstances, and his life takes a drastic turn. He withdraws into his mind. One day he comes across a silent film on the television by a virtually unknown actor that changes something inside him and provides a reason to continue existing. He begins to investigate the actor/filmmaker and discovers the man suddenly disappears at the height of his career. Zimmer's research and eventual writing of a book about the man and his films, begins a set of happenings in truly Auster-synchronistic style, that takes us on an incredible journey about love, art, the nature of art and its relation to life. This text asks many important questions: What is the purpose of art? Is it simply created to entertain? Or is the process of creation worthwhile and necessary in itself? At the book's climax, I was reminded of Jack Kerouec in 'The Vanity of Dulouz', rising early in the morning, writing frantically into the night, to only destroy the work by fire, page by page, to then begin again the following day. What was old Jack attempting to prove? Was he trying to prove the turn of the century adage, 'Art for Art's sake', that school of European Decadence? This of course begs another question, why write or create at all if no one can experience it? It was the French writer, Albert Camus, who once said that writers write to be read, and if they say otherwise, they're lying. The message in ~Illusions~ is quite clear: Art can and does give hope to the world full of sorrow and tragedy - and the work must be shared with others. Art provides, however small, hope for humankind.<br />I've attempted to describe one of the major themes in this extraordinary novel, but there are many others.

This incredible little book was recommended to me for many years because of the texts inspirational qualities, in terms of offering timeless simple truths concerning thrift, financial planning and the value of a good work ethic. The formula offered for financial independence is highly practical and workable. Promoted as success secrets of the ancients, the text is written in parable form, similar to the bible, which gives the entire work a credible quality. I know from personal experience, that with persisitence, a good work ethic and a strong will to succeed; one can achieve a modicum of financial prosperity. Which, by the way, includes enjoying the fruits of one's labours. \\"Enjoy life while you are here. Do not overstrain or try to save too much...live otherwise according to your income and let not yourself get niggardly and afraid to spend. Life is good and life is rich with things worthwhile and things to enjoy.\\" (20) In other terms, the lesson offered is a practice in moderation, not letting one's behavioural pendulum swing too far either way, but earning well and living well in the mean is a key to achieving a happy life. If you read any 'financial success' book this year, let it be this one.	2003-05-23

This short, though concise and informed critical biography of William James is a good introduction to his life and thought. The text predominately is a historical analysis concerning the era in which he lived, providing us with the necessary social influences that shaped the man's philosophy. One of the arguments in this text is that all philosophy is a biographical expression of the philosopher. And James wanted to express philosophy in the most accessible terms possible. As Cotkin suggests, James was a public philosopher, he wanted '...philosophy to be a conversation, a playful yet serious and enlightening confrontation with philosophical and cultural issues.'(14) He brought philosophy into the public arena and made it his life's mission to combat systematisation and abstraction, the \\"abstract rigmarole\\" that can riddle this subject. The subject of philosophy has been exiled to the academy - a specialized technical area of learning designed for the insecure elite. James wanted philosophy to be a 'passionate vision', not a complex array of problematic terms and ideas. He believed professional academics and their writings \\"obscured the truth\\". As Cotkin writes, 'Through his public philosophy James codified his revolt - and enlisted himself among those who practiced philosophy as edification - against the pretensions of professional philosophy.'(15)<br />This text presents us with a man who is the expression of a generation. He was a man of the times. Cotkin then moves on to James' family influences, his brilliant and eccentric father as well as the intellectual relationship with his brother, Henry. What begins to unfold is an individual who achieved the ability '...to universalise his private universe into public discourse, as well as the reality that his turmoil was the common cultural property of other Americans.' This convergence of public and private indivudual, Cotkin suggests, defined or translated into what became James' philosophical doctrine.<br />The most interesting chapter is 'The Discourse of Heroism'. Here Cotkin explores the philosopher's value on maintaining an on going 'passionate engagement' with life. In this chapter the author takes the reader through the many arguments concerning James' call for excitement and strenuosity in one's approach to existence, but with a warning: one must also remain committed to \\"courage weighted with responsibility.\\"<br />~William James Public Philosopher~ is well researched and well written, presenting us with the man, the times in which he lived and his refreshing view of philosophy which continues to be important and relevant in the 21st century.interesting chapter is 'The Discourse of Heroism'.

Particularly when it's written with such flair. Amis has a caustic pen - informed and sprinkled with ironic humor. As the title of this collection suggests, his target is literary cliche, and he has an uncanny ability to ferret them out, revealing that our best author's can slide into this lazy habit. It became obvious to me after reading this text that Amis' range of reading is massive in scope. It seems the man will read and review anything if it catches his attention. Like most of us he has his hobbyhorses and favourite writers, but through the years has given us a wide variety of criticism from popular paperbacks to Joyce's 'Ulysses'. We all have our literary heroes and models, and Amis has his - Vladimir Nabokov. In fact we have an entire section devoted to the man, commenting on his lectures, plays, short stories and the novels. The reader can gain greater insight into literature from well-written criticism, and Amis does this for us. After reading his comments on Nabokov, it became evident to me that my reading of this great author was only superficial and required further study. This is what good criticism should do: provide greater insight and prompt further reading.<br />This collection contains subject matter other than literature that Amis appears to have great concern; namely nuclear bombs and the sport of chess. Amis is a child of the sixties, when the threat of nuclear disaster was very real. Our new generation seem now to be more concerned with Globalism than the threat of a nuclear holocaust. But the threat is still eminent and should be talked and written about today. Amis' comments twenty years ago are still relevant and awareness of this impending doom should be kept firmly in the public eye. Amis' reviews on the game of chess were also quite informative, revealing to me a whole other world. A good writer can make the most mundane subjects look interesting, and Amis can do this effortlessly.<br />As a practitioner-critic, Amis is one of the best we have...and this collection more than proves it...good reading.practitioner-critic, Amis is one of the best we have...and this collection more than proves it...good reading.	2003-05-11

It has been three years since this book burst onto the market place and was given the hysteric fanfare and critical acclaim from the likes of the 'Guardian' and the 'New York Times Book Review'. At that moment in history it appeared this book could do no wrong - a perfect thriller and a triumph for the literary establishment. After finally reading it last night, I'd have to say that the general response from these distinghed critics was way over the top. The novel is good, but not that good. Harris was true to his successful formula and as a result, managed to sell a lot of books. Contrary to popular opinion, however, ~Hannibal~ pales in comparison to its predecessors. And it fails on many counts.<br />The success of the 'Hannibal' trilogy is an intriguing one. Dr. Hannibal Lecter is without question, the story's appeal. Here is the manifestation of a monster with god-like qualities: the archangel Lucifer in the guise of a psychiatrist. Lecter is the fallen angel in human form - the spoilt prodigy child forced to live amongst human beings who he sees as nothing more than chimpanzees. Exiled from paradise, he's hell-bent on making trouble, ensuring the great cosmic experiment will fail. Most of us have 'sympathy for the devil' because we're all essentially in the same boat. There are moments in our lives that we too feel exiled from heaven, and can relate to the devil's resentment. Hannibal is a mythological figure in modern form; he's Milton's Satan with a medical degree. The novel is a distilled version of a missing chapter in 'Paradise Lost' in the guise of a paperback thriller.<br />The novel moves along well up to the point where we are told why Dr. Lecter does what he does...the reason for his cannibalism and his hatred for the world. This particular causal explanation struck me as much too easy: something a first year psychology undergraduate would dream-up...and it was disappointing. The 'true' evil in the novel is the antagonist, Mason Verger - a maimed pedeophile with a penchant for drinking the tears of abused children. This is a disturbing idea. Harris has a disturbing imagination; but the Verger character isn't smart enough to manifest something a subtle as this insanity - he would have come up with something a lot more sinister and sophisticated for exacting revenge on the good doctor. The Verger character didn't pan out; he simply was too melodramatic to the point of absurdity.<br />To Harris's credit, the ending was a surprising one. The Starling character, in the previous book, was a person that most of us could relate to...a virtuous individual fighting the good fight. Harris turns this around, however, and the reason(s) given for Starling's fall from grace is weak. That said, the last fifty pages describing the therapy exchange between Lecter and our tainted maiden is chilling.<br />The myth of Hannibal Lecter is an old one. But Harris gives us nothing new, and pessimistically presents us with a future of no hope. Even the Starling's of the world will fall from grace, and there's nothing we can do about it. In this round, at least, evil takes the upper hand.ophile with a penchant for drinking the tears of abused children. This is a disturbing idea.

Originally a collection of eleven five-cent Blue Book instalments, ~The Story of Philosophy~ was first published in its current form in 1925; and within two years reached over two million in sales, launching Durant's career as one of the most recognized and honoured writers and historians in the world. Translated into nineteen languages, this book continues to sell at a consistent rate, used by schools and universities across the globe as an introduction to the Western Tradition of philosophy from Plato, Spinoza and William James, ending with the great American educationalist, John Dewey.<br />As the word 'story' in the title suggests, the book is written as a narrative; this particular stylistic method was highly criticised by academics, turning their noses up in arrogant disdain, because everyone could now understand this specialized subject...Durant made philosophy accessible and exciting, also adding a touch of humour to an otherwise serious endeavour, he writes in the preface of the second edition:<br />&quot;The 'Story' tried to salt itself with a seasoning of humour, not only because wisdom is not wise if it scares merriment, but because a sense of humour, being born of perspective, bears a near kinship to philosophy; each is the soul of the other. But this appears to have displeased the pundits; nothing so hurt the book with them as it smiles.&quot; (xii)<br />Durant also makes it quite clear that this book is by no means a substitute for reading philosophy in the original. &quot;...God knows there is no short cut to knowledge; after forty years of seeking her one finds &quot;Truth&quot; still veiled, and what she shows of herself most disconcerting.&quot; What is most important about this text, I believe, is that it could well be a starting point for a future William James, John Dewey or a Wittgenstein. Durant's robust prose style reels the reader in, seducing, enticing and giving you just enough to want to plunge into philosophy, boots and all...he does what all great teachers do - creates a fascinating world for the subject and connects it to the everyday and personal.

Unfortunately, this is a pathological symptom of democracy, where mediocrity must be exalted at all costs, to maintain the notion of equality. Men and women must be viewed as equal under the eyes of the law and society, for this is justice. But we are not equal in health, wealth, intelligence and talent. What Will Durant has shown us unashamedly is \\"...that at the beginning and summit of every age some heroic genius stands, the voice and index of his time...the guide and pioneer into the future.\\" (10)<br />This necessary little book presents six essays on the greatest thoughts, minds and books of all time. The reader may disagree occasiionally with his choices, though Durant compellingly argues his choices from his informed view as a recognized historian, philosopher and teacher.<br />The text is a snap shot of history; an opportunity to see the past and its great historical figures through the eyes of a man who made it his life mission to celebrate what it means to be human. Durant's humanism and enthusiasm is highly infectious - one comes away from his texts with a renewed hope that civilization was once great and can be great again. We have been submerged into the pessimistic, fragmented and distilled perspectives of Modernism far too long. Durant's optimism slices like Excaliber through our fashionable cynicism about the world; he is the intellectual white knight, celebrating the miracle of existence and the endless potential of humanity.<br />At the moment the world is filled with uncertainty and pessimism, therefore this text is highly recommended, for it might cast a glimmer of hope, and a renewed optimism about the world, the future and us.	2003-04-20

One reviewer called this book a mental adventure and a cross-referencing nightmare. So it was with great curiosity that I finally read ~The Da Vinci Code~ last week to find another intelligent approach to this intriguing subject in the form of a paperback thriller. It is a majority consensus that Brown writes this genre as it should be written: one simply cannot put the book down until all the mysteries are solved and you read the last page. Most would agree that this genre of novel has developed into an art form, and it is obvious that Dan Brown, along with his editors, have taken the form to near perfection in this book. If it weren't for the sun making a surprise appearance through my window, and the terrible realization that I had to work that day, this excellent novel would have been read in one sitting.<br />To be fair, one really cannot make a comparison between Eco's novel and ~The Da Vinci Code~. Both texts cover similar ground in respect to Grail theories, the Catholic Church and that mysterious organization, The Priory of Sion. ~The Da Vinci Code~ slaps the subject matter into a fast-paced-thriller-context, that doesn't let the reader rest for a second, which is what this type of book is designed to do. In other words, this book only scratches the surface of the many secret societies and religious theories that truly exist all around us. Whereas Eco's 'Pendulum' explores these theories and societies from a variety of different angles and at greater depth. Eco does this, of course, with a sly wink and his tongue planted firmly in his cheek.<br />It is obvious, however, that Brown is not playing any games, and uses this captivating subject matter to great effect, which amongst other things, is informative and extremely entertaining. If you're even slightly interested in religious conspiracy theories, and a fan of the thriller genre, ~The Da Vinci Code~ will give you everything you require...and more.interested in religious conspiracy theories, and a fan of the thriller genre, ~The Da Vinci Code~ will give you everything you require...and more.	2003-04-15

Nietzsche's writings have been interpreted, misinterpreted, translated, mistranslated and mutated to serve many individual interests - from the evils of the Third Reich to the man's only sister, 'editing' his work to suit her personal, social and political gains. Like Freud, Nietzsche has been used and abused as a platform in the creation of 'new' philosophies, some citing his work as inspiration, while others, in a fit of intellectual dishonesty, claim his ideas as their own. It has been said many times that he is the most misunderstood philosopher of the modern age. From my readings and experience, this claim is not far from the truth. This brilliant book, however, in a single brush of elegance and heart, re-examines Fredric Nietzsche and his work in a gentle, unpretentious though concise way, and attempts to introduce or re-introduce readers to this intriguing, inspiring and highly complex mind.<br />Chamberlain writes with passion and intuitive insight about the last sane year of Nietzsche's life while he lived and worked in the beautiful city of Turin. This was more than any other a happy and productive time in the professor's life. This is much more than a biographical narrative, but a brave exploration by Chamberlain into the sights, sounds, thoughts and relationships of this fragile though contradictory philosopher. This book is not so much a cerebral approach to the man and his thought, but an emotional, visceral appraisal of a unique thinker striving to understand the human condition.<br />Of the many biographical narratives about Nietzsche's descent into madness, Chamberlain is the most sensitive without the sentimentalism or coldness similar to the many other descriptions I've encountered. It strikes at the heart with precision and leaves a lasting impression.<br />If you are a philosopher or merely interested in a unique approach to telling the story of a thinker who has shaped modern philosophy in the twentieth and twenty-first century, read this text. It will be well worth the time, money and effort.It will be well worth the time, money and effort.	2003-03-23

One of the most important skills a student must acquirer when learning history, amongst others, is the ability to evoke a state of empathy for the time period under study. Names, dates and events can only provide us with the obvious and superficial, however, in my opinion, to actually attempt to place oneself emotionally at a particular place on the time-line, can give us a greater insight and a much more profound understanding. Through this method, too, history is not merely words on a page, but something tangible and relevant.<br />~Memoirs of Hadrian~ conjures the world of ancient times through the eyes of the Roman Emperor, Hadrian, with such sensual accuracy that, wholly or in part, a conscious attempt at 'suspension of disbelief' is not necessary, because one can sit back and let the author do it for you...Yourcenar is a magician at literary prose. In her 'Reflection on the Composition', she writes a curious comment:<br />\\"Time itself has nothing to do with it. It is always surprising to me that my contemporaries, masters as they consider themselves to be over space, apparently remain unaware that one can contract the distance between centuries at will.\\" (276)<br />This is a unique and somewhat mysterious skill to have, and a skill every historian should possess or at least learn, because history is so vital to the present day.<br />This is a magnificent novel because it combines historical erudition with a superlative prose style, placing the reader into the time of one of the most fascinating Roman Emperors of the second century. As is well known to students of ancient Rome, Hadrian came to power after Trajan, and stopped Rome's imperialist expansion, concentrating his efforts on domestic issues, enriching culturally, Rome and her colonies. Hadrian was an expert politician, man of letters, artist, visionary, philosopher, investigator of the divine, poet and lover. He is known as the travelling Emperor, because he spent most of his reign abroad, visiting Rome's many colonies.<br />The overall theme of this exquisite text is a man's confrontation with his mortality through recalling and narrating his life. Death is the central theme of this book. Hadrian is writing his memoirs to his benefactor, Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher Emperor, describing his life, and passing on what wisdom he thought he had gained over a long and full existence.

Granted, some diarists write to be read, while most, in my opinion, do not. But there is a kind of sweet pleasure in committing a misdemeanour and getting away with it - which is the sensation one feels when reading this anthology.<br />There are some 170 diarists in this anthology, some well known and others not so, and well over 1800 entries, containing profound thoughts of the time from a few great historical figures to the routine-filled humdrum of the day-to-day. The humdrum day-to-day, in most cases, was a lot more interesting because it is usually what people do everyday that provides insight into their character and the times in which they lived.<br />On the front flap of the cover is a single line that really defines a great diarist - \\"The best diarists are those who write without looking over their shoulders.\\" That total lack of self-consciousness, that pure honesty that comes with writing about self and others, is certainly a pleasure for the reader. For example, a simple line, almost an after thought, written by the French novelist, Andre Gide - \\"It requires a great effort to convince myself that I am as old as those who seemed to me old when I was young.\\"<br />Because this anthology includes both famous diarists and those not so famous, many unknown individuals in some cases, there is a biography section at the back which gives a brief history for each contributor, that for me, managed to provide enough background information for the entries to be much more meaningful.<br />As with most anthologies, one does not necessarily need to read them chronologically, but can dip, skip and choose ar random as the particular mood dictates. This is the perfect book to have by your bed to read a few short or long entries before falling to sleep. One can sample a taste of the 16th century with one of the most famous diarists, Samuel Pepys, and jump a few pages ahead to read Andy Warhol and his unusual observations about some famous people and New York's art world of the sixties.<br />Great stuff.e most famous diarists, Samuel Pepys, and jump a few pages ahead to read Andy Warhol and his unusual observations about some famous people and New York's art world of the sixties.<br />Great stuff.	2003-03-16

As minutes passed, a few people stood up to put on their coats, but sat down again, turning and discussing their lives. This strange behaviour continued on for some hours. Miller sat backstage, his head in his hands, not wanting to confront the possibility that his play had been a flop - this was far from the case, ~Salesman~ was a runnaway hit, and continues to be the emblematic portrayal of personal tragedy combined with cultural crises.<br />~Salesman~ is about many things. It is a tragedy about the collapse of the notion that personal success is measured by one's financial prosperity. Willy Loman's tragedy is really two-fold: the need of most people to make a 'mark' in their lives either through financial success or merely being loved by one's friends and family. In the end, Loman comes to realize his son Biff loves him; however, ironically, this realization only propounds his material failure which consequently, leads to his final attempt at 'success', ending in his tragic suicide.<br />This superlative play is a dramatic lesson in the individual tragedy of a man pursuing materialistic success at the expense of the higher values of personal, emotional growth and fulfillment that can only be achieved by truly knowing oneself.<br />~Salesman~ is a moralistic play. It teaches us that Willy Loman is Everyman. We're all part of a system that pushes the lie that materialism measures the worth of people, but to exclude basic human values, knowledge, community, and love, is to court disaster, and in poor Willy Loman's case, self destruction.<br />This play is the great American tragedy and a valuable lesson for us all.	2003-03-08

This is by far one of the best biographies I've read in recent times. Not only is the subject matter astonishing, capturing the life of one of the most exciting figures of the 19th century, the author focuses on the man's profuse writings, thankfully leaving out the once fashionable psychoanalytic approach of interpretation when writing biography. This is the third life history I've read on Richard Burton, and it's certainly the finest written and the most thorough.<br />Those of you, who are not familiar with R.F. Burton, are in for a thrilling reading experience. This man, probably more so than Byron himself, is the archetypal Byronic figure of the age: a linguist, (29 languages and numerous dialects), scholar of eastern literature and religion, particularly the mystical arm of Islam, Sufi; a practicing mystic; explorer of Africa (co-discoverer of the source of the Nile); a secret agent working for her majesty during England's acquisition of India's wealth, known to historians as 'The Great Game'. He was also one of the first white men, who made the Pilgrimage to Mecca, and as Rice argues, Burton was and continued to be a practicing Muslim, therefore his pilgrimage was deeply religious as well as a journey of danger and adventure. Burton was dashing, an expert swordsman and horseman, and a prolific writer, poet and translator who rank as one of the best of his time.<br />Burton is known to most as one of the scholars who brought 'The Arabian Nights' to the West...he heard a lot of the tales through the Persian oral tradition; memorized them in their original language, and sat around many a camp fire in the desert, re-telling these wonderful stories to anyone who would listen. Burton was a storyteller in the truest sense. But 'The Arabian Nights' only scratches the surface of his many translations from eastern literature - 'The Kama Sutra of Vatsyaya' and 'The Perfumed Garden of the Cheikh Nefzaoui: A Manual of Arabian Erotology', to name an infamous few...<br />What impressed me most about Burton was his alarming intellectual curiousity, his exhaustive industry as a recorder of foreign cultures. While other 'gentleman' of his time would rather murder the wildlife to take back to their drawing rooms, to then hang on their walls, Burton preferred to sketch and write about the places and people he came across in his travels to then share with the rest of us. He was an incessant scribbler. The man's thirst for life was daunting and this magnetic soul ensured he did not waste a minute of it...<br />Edward Rice's ~Captain Sir Richard Frances Burton~ is the definitive biography.at impressed me most about Burton was his alarming intellectual curiousity, his exhaustive industry as a recorder of foreign cultures.

This short biography touches upon the salient points of a fascinating individual: John W. Parsons, self-educated, visionary, explosives expert, rocket scientist and striving occultist, died at an early age, thirty seven, due to a freak explosion in his garage, a makeshift laboratory that was later discovered, had enough explosive material within it to take-out an entire city block. Was it murder? Was it a major conjuring ritual gone wrong? Or was it simply a terrible accident due to carelessness and oversight?<br />Parsons was indeed a unique character. His interest in Science Fiction, for example, moved him into literary circles, whose members are SF legends: Heinlein, Van Vogt...he became the protege of the founder of the OTO, Aleister Crowley. Another interesting personality, L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology, moved into his house, and allegedly took part in an extensive magical rite that might have drastically changed, for the worse, Parsons life. Many things may have contributed to Parsons turn of bad luck, but as the author points out, Hubbard ran off with Parsons wife and disappeared with a substantial sum of money, which later, Parsons sued for and won. Betrayal can have a devastating effect on anyone, as it obviously did on Parsons...<br />My only criticism of the text is the superficial manner in which the subject matter was explored - for such an interesting individual, much more time could have been spent researching his relationships and particularly his time at Hughes Aircraft and the alleged 'deal' he made with the Israeli government. It was rumoured that Parsons was organising to move to Israel with his wife Cameron, just prior to his mysterious death. Similar to most artists and non-conformists of the time, Parsons had a thick FBI file and had been under surveillance for an extended period...these intriguing aspects of Parsons life should have been unpacked, but were not...your guess is as good as mine.<br />Despite its lack of depth, ~Sex and Rockets~ is a fascinating read.f depth, ~Sex and Rockets~ is a fascinating read.	2002-12-30

This most recent novel by Michael Crichton is another deep expression of concern about the misuse of science and technology by future-blind, irresponsible scientists and corporations bent only on the 'bottom-line'; and as a result, blind as to the dire consequences of their actions. As he writes in the introduction, '...our self-deluded recklessness will collide with our growing technological power.' In fact, this has been Crichton's pre-occupation for over twenty-five years, beginning with one of his first novels, 'The Terminal Man.' His most successfiul novel to date, 'Jurassic Park', expressed this concern in no uncertain terms - genetics gone terribly wrong - in this case, however, nature retaliates in the form of dangerous dinosaurs. In ~Prey~ the new villian takes the form of self-reproducing machines - nanoparticles or micro-robots - a highly creative merging of nanotechnology, biotechnology and computer science.<br />What I personally enjoy about all Crichton's novels, is that you never come away from the reading experience without learning something. The man does immaculate research for each project and it shows. This novel is no different.<br />Crichton fans will not be disappointed with this novel because it reads at a cracking pace, maintaining tension until the last page.<br />~Prey~ is a highly informative and entertaining read.	2002-12-12

Huxley's concerns are our concerns - overpopulation, ecology, eugenics, fair and oppressive government, drug use and the nature of religion and art. He wrote extensively on all these subjects with eerie insight and awareness. Poet and author, Nicholas Murray, provides a window into Huxley's life and character, which shows us an intellectual continually striving for knowledge: intuitive, scientific and otherwise.<br />As a personality, Murry points out that Huxley was an abstractionist trying to come to terms with his instinctual nature. But Huxley was probably harder on himself than any critic could be. He described himself as a 'cerebrotonic', and defines the type:<br />\\"The cerebrotonic is the over-alert, over-sensitive introvert, who is more concerned with the inner universe of his own thoughts and feelings and imagination than the external world...Their normal manner is inhibited and restrained and when it comes to the expression of feelings they are outwardly so inhibited that viscerotonics suspect them of being heartless.\\" (P.3)<br />Huxley was anything but 'heartless'. If one reads his novels, early poetry and essays, can see that he was a humanist, presenting us with the follies of the human condition with the intention of making the world a better place.<br />Murry paints us a portrait of a man who wrote because, '...the wolf was at the door.' He was a seeker of knowledge who wanted to join the artistic sensibility with that of the scientific. In fact, one of his last essays, 'Literature and Science' was an attempt at such a synthesis: 'Man cannot live by contemplative receptivity and artistic creation alone...he needs science and technology.' (P.451)<br />What emerges from this text is an individual with a ravenous thirst for knowledge, an artist/scientist who wanted to pave new paths towards a more understanding world. This is an excellent biography, brilliantly written, of a complex and fascinating being./>What emerges from this text is an individual with a ravenous thirst for knowledge, an artist/scientist who wanted to pave new paths towards a more understanding world.

Sometime in 1998, on a not-so unusual evening, my computer, once booting it up, seemed to explode in a dance of light and sound - my email had been inundated with the news that the famous author of 'The Teachings of Don Juan', Carlos Castaneda, had leaped into the abyss, never to return. The general response to his final passing, the commencement of his 'definitive-journey', was an ecstatic celebration: his work, it had been said, was finally complete. My feelings were mixed. Castaneda had been a close 'literary friend', a quasi-spiritual companion who, through his many books, made me aware that all things are indeed possible. The 'warrior-traveller' had moved on, and it was rumoured that his last book, ~The Active Side of Infinity~ was on the way.<br />It has been four years, and for a variety of reasons, I never got around to reading it, but finally did last week. To be sure, this last installment ranks, in my mind, as one of his best. This is the last in a long line of texts concerning Castaneda's appreticeship as a sorcerer, working under the tutelage of Don Juan Matus - a 'nagual' of mystery, power and hilarious wit. Don Juan has to be one of the most interestiing characters of the twentieth century. And to finally meet him again in ~Infinity~ was certainly a pleasure.<br />~Infinity~ has to be the most accessible of all Castaneda's books. We can almost categorize it as being his last will and testament before his final exit into infinity - an effort to pay off his spiritual debts as a warrior-traveller, recapitulating (Don Juan's term) memorable events and relationships in his life that changed his path or had, either consciously or not, affected or had a profound significance in his life as a sorcerer. The book is a collection of Castaneda's memories, intense and not so, that through re-living would prepare him for the 'definitive-journey' into the abyss. Death is the central theme in ~Infinity~, communicating the importance of preparing oneself for the unavoidable end we all must embark upon...<br />I was reminded of Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychiatrist who, in the last years of his life, always had 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead' on his night stand, referring to it before falling to sleep. This was Jung's way of preparing himself for the definitive journey. Castaneda, though, through re-living the past, sought-out some of the more significant people in his life, and made a practical attempt to set things right. This made a lot of sense to me on many levels.<br />To suggest to new readers of Castaneda to begin with ~Infinity~ would be, in my mind, a disservice. My advice would be to start from the beginning with 'The Teachings of Don Juan' and move on from there...one's appreciation of the entire philosophy will be much deeper as a result. That said, however, ~Infinity~ could well be a good starting point, because as I mentioned before, it's the most accessible of the canon.idable end we all must embark upon...<br />I was reminded of Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychiatrist who, in the last years of his life, always had 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead' on his night stand, referring to it before falling to sleep.

This short novel has relevance for any individual who chooses to grapple with the onslaught of information that pours forth from various institutions, including modern education and the media. I had read ~Notes from the Underground~ many years ago, and picking it up again proved to be a positive move, philosophically, politically and socially, on a very personal level. The narrator is a 19th century man who has chosen to withdraw from society and rant and rave in a kind of 'neurotic' protest against the ever-prevalent 'rational forces' or normalizing conditions that society is imposing. In brief, his protest is against the popular philosophical view of the time, deterministic materialism. He asks: Is man a free agent? Are his actions and desires his own; or conversely, is he endowed with some Universal nature, where his interests, desires and overall behaviour is predetermined? In his terms, are we &quot;Piano keys&quot;, or merely &quot;Organ stops&quot; responding blindly to the 'rational forces' that continually bombard us on a daily basis?<br />This book is an argument supporting the view that irrationality has its merits. We are in danger of ignoring our own desires in favour of a popular or dominate view. What the underground man is proposing is to be aware of the danger of buying into the proposition that there is a collective 'common good', that all people are essentially the same and desire the same things. He goes on to warn that if the men of 'science' are correct, if our desires and interests are the same, if our behaviour can be recorded on some central data base, where all we have to do to understand how we should behave is by logging onto this data base, what hope does humankind have of experiencing individual needs, creativity, adventure and innovation? According to the underground man, absolutely no hope at all.<br />The American philosopher, William James, had grappled with the same argument around the same time that this novel was written. He recorded in his diary that his first act of free will was to believe he had free will, and began his new life on that simple but important premise.<br />Freedom for William James and the underground man is the highest most valuable aspect of our existence. The underground man believed that it was absolutely imperative that we at times go against our 'best interests' even if our free will is an illusion. When considering the barrage of information that continually comes our way, we should attempt to separate the 'wheat from the chaff' according to our desires, beliefs and will - a word of advice from a 19th century 'neurotic'.<br />It is impossible to illustrate the many facets of this important novel in the limited space provided. Therefore I urge you to open ~Notes from the Underground~ and submerge yourself into the ideas and arguments it proposes we consider.rded in his diary that his first act of free will was to believe he had free will, and began his new life on that simple but important premise.<br />Freedom for William James and the underground man is the highest most valuable aspect of our existence.

A specific theme is explored from a variety of perspectives in many of de Botton's books, including ~Proust~, and that is, how to successfully respond to the vagaries of life. These vagaries and pre-occupations include the pursuit of love, happiness and, most importantly, how to make use of suffering, how to learn from the inevitable pain that this life will bring to some. However, what is it that makes de Botton's advice more palatable than the common spewing from your garden-variety self-help manual? Apart from his user-friendly writing style, it's his approach, his unique way of interpreting great works of philosophy and literature, and re-moulding age-old notions into workable methods of application to the personal and everyday.<br />The key, I believe, to fully appreciating what this particular text has to offer, is to understand Proust's various responses to the world - what I like to call his inner-worldliness. It is well known, of course, that Proust was not a 'worldly' man in the common sense of the term, but worldly in that vast terrain known as the imagination. In fact, this gentle and fragile writer, most of his short life, rarely stepped out of his bedroom, let alone transverse the expanses of Europe. Proust's gift was the uncanny ability to observe something as apparently mundane as a pocket watch or a scrap of bed linen, and through a mental process of rich association, create new and meaningful experiences. What Proust taught us through his voluminous works, which de Botton points out, is what we all too often take for granted, ironically, has the potential to give us what we need.<br />~How Proust can Change your Life~ is one of those texts that you can pick up after lunch and finish before dinner, yet the contents and practical wisdom should remain with you for a long time.	2002-10-24

Alain De Botton's latest publication, ~The Art of Travel~ is a philosophical investigation, simply written, on the reasons and motivations for why we travel. The book's main thesis is that our lives are dominated by a search for that illusive and fleeting emotion or state known as happiness. Travel, he proposes, is a major activity, amongst many, where we seek-out this state of mind. Travel can possibly show us what life is about outside our routine-filled day-to-day existence. The book examines our motives for travelling, our anticipations, and expectations using the writings of various artists, poets and explorers, providing different and highly creative perspectives on the subject.<br />Personally, I found the most rewarding and instructive chapter to be, 'On eye-opening Art', using the views and paintings of Vincent van Gogh. Just as instructive, however, is the chapter, 'On Possessing Beauty', drawing on the works of the 19th century critic and writer, John Ruskin. The message from both these individuals are quite similar. One of the tasks of art, specifically painting, is to provide us, the viewer, with new perspectives in which to view the world. Vincent van Gogh's exceedingly original style and use of colour, for example, transformed, for some of us, the way we see a sunflower, a wheat field and a Cypress tree. When viewing these works of art, or any work of art, we are inspired to travel to these places where the artist created, and experience the subject of the works first-hand.<br />John Ruskin believed that one of our primary needs in life is beauty and its possession. He suggested that the only meaningful way to possess beauty was through understanding it: '...making ourselves conscious of the factors (psychological and visual) that are responsible for it,' (P.220) The way to attain this understanding, he suggests, is to draw and write (word paint) those things and places we come across in our travels that strike us as beautiful. A person sitting down in front of an expansive landscape, and sketching its many features, will discover aspects about the scene that would be invisible to the casual observer.

On that fateful day, 4 May 1953, Aldous Huxley, novelist, philosopher, poet and world famous intellectual, drank a glass of water mixed with silvery white mescalin. As Humphrey Osmond, a Canadian psychiatrist, specializing in schizophrenia, wrote, \\"It was a delicious May morning in Hollywood, no hint of smog to make the eyes smart, not too hot.\\" Osmond had supplied the drug to Huxley for the experiment, and acted as 'observing recorder' of the historical event.<br />Huxley had high hopes for the experience, and believed that the drug would in fact admit him into the world that Blake painted and tried to describe in his poetry; and also possibly transport him into the mystical world of Meister Eckhart. The reality of the situation exceeded his hopes - as Huxley wrote in ~The Doors of Perception~, \\"I was seeing what Adam had seen on the morning of his creation - the miracle, moment by moment, of naked existence.\\"<br />~The Doors of Perception~ is an important commentary from a man of rationality and science, attempting to investigate what some call 'Intuitive knowledge'. As a researcher and writer, he knew second hand these reported heightened states of awareness, had observed and dimly 'felt' these states through painting, architecture and art in general, but wanted desperately to experience them first hand. The book describes his feelings, perceptions and thoughts about the experiment.<br />Huxley writes that one of our basic universal human needs is to transcend our, at times, banal consciousness, \\"...the urge to transcend self conscious self-hood is...a principal appetite of the soul.\\" (P.54) We have been doing it and continue to do it since time immemorial. Our methods, however, particularly in modern times, has been destructive. He writes, \\"When, for whatever reason, men and women fail to transcend themselves by means of worship, good works and spiritual exercises, they are apt to resort to religion's chemical surrogates - alcohol and 'goof-pills' in the modern West, alcohol and opium in the East, hashish in the Mohammedan world, alcohol and marijuana in Central America...\\" (P.54) Unfortunately these sad and destructive alternatives have mounted since this writing, but the central message is the same. He goes on to say, \\"Ideally, everyone should be able to find self-transcendence in some form of pure or applied religion.\\" But, for the most part, \\"...the hungry sheep look up and are not fed.\\"<br />~Heaven and Hell~ is a sequel to ~The Doors of Perception~ describing or more so reflecting on the visionary experience through various means. Huxley also explores the understandings of other minds in their perceptions and cosmological notions expressed through art, and why they are impelled to express these notions. He also describes the dark side to spiritual insight of the divine nature: the dark, empty journey of the soul when overwhelmed by such experiences, manifested in mental illness such as schizophrenia.<br />This important book was first published in 1954, and has become a classic that continues to communicate the plight and experince of the human condition: concise and easy to read - an absolute must.West, alcohol and opium in the East, hashish in the Mohammedan world, alcohol and marijuana in Central America...\\" (P.54) Unfortunately these sad and destructive alternatives have mounted since this writing, but the central message is the same.

Apart from being a first class scoundrel, there are some notable qualities about this man, and Sutin manages to portray these qualities, along with Crowley's defects with admirable equilibrium.<br />As Lawrence Sutin points out, Aleister Crowley was a genius at self-promotion, but most of his life received the wrong kind of publicity to sell his books. (Which apart from his spiritual pursuits, was his major motivation in life) It seems, above all else, Crowley wanted to be a recognized 'man of letters' in the 19th century sense of the term. That is, in the Romantic tradition, positioning himself with the likes of Shelly and Byron. If one can ignore the hoopla that continues ad nauseam about the man, and takes the time and trouble to read his voluminous works, can recognize these Romantic influences. He was also a Modernist writer that ranks with the authors we associate with that tradition: Ezra Pound, D.H. Lawrence and many others. The problem with Crowley, however, is that his reputation always preceded him, influencing the public into premature and hasty judgements. This is a common problem with large personalities. Granted, though, 'the beast' deserved some of the slanderous publicity that was continually thrown his way -he also, at times, consciously created it.<br />As is the case with many famous and infamous personalities, such as Sigmund Freud, Aaron Burr, and R.F. Burton, for example, is that the public will cast judgement on them without investigating their lives or reading their works. I cannot even count the numerous instances where people would dismiss Freud and his works, without having read anything about psychoanalysis; basing their judgements on some personal bias or dubious secondary source. Sutin's fair biography of Aleister Crowley gives the reader the opportunity to investigate the many facets of the man, and at last dispel the 'tabloid' generated myths surrounding him.<br />Aleister Crowley was an eccentric of the first order. His unusual personality evoked fascination, awe, puzzlement, disdain and pure hatred from many noteworthy people of his time. Any way you look at it, however, his 'spiritual-calling' was quite real; remove the innuendo and gossip mongering, he truly believed that his 'Book of the Law' was the spiritual message for a new age. And the message is a simple one: \\"...devoting oneself earnestly to one's true work on earth, which could be discovered through self-examination guided by advice of wise men.\\" (P.370) Through dogged persistence and intense self-examination, one may discover their true will, and by following it, will develop as a human being. This of course echoes the advice of the philosopher, Socrates - \\"Know thy self\\", which is one of our main tasks in life. As Socrates went on to say, \\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\" Interestingly, Crowley's 'Book of ther Law', essentially proposes the same thing.<br />This is a wonderfully detailed account of one of the most notorious characters of the twentieth century. Sutin has approached the subject in a scholarly and balanced manner, giving us the chance to assess Aleister Crowley at his best and diabolical worst - an excellent biography.onality evoked fascination, awe, puzzlement, disdain and pure hatred from many noteworthy people of his time.

A beautiful musical instrument can be compared to a great vintage wine; one does not need to know all its subtleties in order to appreciate its fine texture, bouquet, and unique taste. Familiarity with art, for example, bolsters one's appreciation of its many forms, and puts one in a frame of mind never to take it for granted. In ~The Piano Shop on the Left Bank~ we are permitted entry into the world of the connoisseur of fine pianos and the magic of superior music. This book describes a re-acqaintance with a love affair of pianos, against the backdrop of romantic Paris and the diverse and unusual characters that make-up this world.<br />An American living in Paris comes across a little piano repair shop that lies almost hidden from the frantic vagaries of modern life. Something about the little shop captures his attention - a spell is cast, and with some persistence, he gains admittance into a secret world for the initiated only - and his journey begins into that predominately guarded artisan society in Paris which the general, foreign public believe only exists in 19th century novels. This elegant text is written with thoughtful care and attention that displays an attitude of mind that is quite rare.<br />Because Carhart is honest about his love affair with the piano and the Classic and Romantic music that we associate with the instrument, Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven and Scarlatte, the reader cannot help but remember personal associations with this world. While reading the text, images from my own past concerning music and the piano rose to consciousness - lying at my mother's feet while she played Chopin, being facinated by the movement of her feet as she depressed the foot pedals and the distinct fragrance of the wood. This beguiling book captures many such images and much more.<br />The book is also unique in so far as the reader receives a history lesson on the piano, from its beginnings in 16th century Italy to its height with the American Steinway to its circular return to Italy, the Fazioli, the finest hand made piano in the world. We actually meet Paola Fazioli in the book and experience the utter majesty and beauty of his creations. To be sure, without question, I felt humbled in the presence of this man and his works of art, following Carhart as he's invited to sit down and play the legendary 'Faziloi 308' - 'the world's most expensive piano' - actually feeling the instruments power of tone through the words on the page.<br />~The Piano Shop on the Left Bank~ is one of those texts which is difficult to put down, but you do so anyway because you want the reading experience to last. And once the book is finally finished, there is a certain sadness that the experience is complete, however, the beauty of a good book is that you can return to it time and again, entering its world.<br />This mesmerizing little book is recommended to any lover of music, no matter what genre or classification. Carhart manages to harness music's universality, its common-shared magic that without, life would be much harder to tolerate. This book will enter, in time, the realm of classic.

Many years ago, an old teacher of mine commented to me that the published writings about Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis could fill a suburban library. This could be a slight exaggeration, but the biographies and published essays that one can find on a university library catalogue, for example, reach a remarkable number. Even today, the interest in the man and his work continues unabated, more in the general humanities, however, than psychology itself. What is this unrelenting fascination about Freud that draws so many people to his life and work? This is a hard question to answer, but an interesting one to consider. In the latest contribution to the Freud canon, ~Freud- Darkness in the Midst of Vision~ Louis Breger attempts a somewhat new interpretation of Freud and psychoanalysis, and a successful one.<br />In the 'Background and Sources' at the back of the text, Breger writes an interesting comment: he states that there are basically three camps or perspectives of the man - the first are the 'fiercely' loyal combatants, the defenders of psychoanalytic orthodoxy; Freud's words are considered gosple and no divergence is permitted. In the second camp are the sharp and brutal critics, who dismiss Freud and psychoanalysis in its entirety. The third category (where Breger places himself) are not worshiping sycophants or radical critics, but those who see the significance of Freud's work, and acknowledge his contributions with a balanced assessment of the man and psychoanalysis in general. This book manages to capture the spirit of the third cartegory with brilliance of insight, objectivity and compassion.<br />I've read many accounts of Freud and the history of psychoanalysis from hagiography, (Ernest Jones' three-volume mythology) to chatty, uninformed rumour mongering, (Paul Ferris -Dr. Freud A Life) and found Breger's to be the most clinically informed and fair of them all.<br />Breger set out to dismantle the many myths surrounding the history of Freud and psychoananlysis. This book is straightforward historical revisionism at its most readable form. He writes of the origins of psychoanalysis and its intellectual development against its historical milieu, that gives the reader a true context in which the movement was born and the reasons why it catapulted into international popularity after the First World War. The text cuts through the folklore and the intentionally generated romance of the subject, revealing a clear well-researched account, which remains as out of the ordinary as the myths themselves.<br />Even with all of Freud's faults and flaws of personality, his steel-like dogmatism and refusal to accept any further developments (contrary to his own) from his followers or divergence from his questionable theories, continues to incite interest and fascination generation after generation. It is his utter strength of personality that was his true genius, that reaches out from the past and grabs our attention. To dismiss this highly original thinker is a mistake. And Louis Breger's ~Freud - Darkness in the Midst of Vision~ emphasises this fact in a lucid, fresh and graceful manner.nanlysis.

Just because one cannot put a particular phenomenon under the rigours of scientific examination, doesn't mean such phenomenon is merely the product of a deranged mind. The reason the protectors of divine rationality are reluctant to examine the paranormal is it seems to contradict known physical laws. It doesn't follow the rules. However, if you have actually had the fortune or misfortune to experience such phenomenon i.e., spirits, UFO's, demonic creatures or source less cries of anguish in the night, ~The Mothman Prophecies~ can seem almost plausible. The book is certainly entertaining and, surprisingly, at times quite frightening.<br />The book essentially focuses on a series of unexplained events that manifested in and around the little West Virginia town of Point Pleasant. Numerous reports of Unidentified Flying Objects and strange lights in the southern skies motivated John Keel to investigate what all the fuss was about, and if there was any truth to the reports. His investigations led him down a peculiar path of events and personal experiences that finally pushed him to develop a theory, albeit an extrardinary one.<br />What is the 'Mothman'? A journalist coined the term from the popular Batman series, because the actual creature, taken from eyewitness accounts, resembles the legendary comic hero. The amount of actual sightings is nothing less than incredible, which leads one to suspect the beast's reality. The book only touches on the Mothman and relates a scattered assortment of weird events and unusual sightings from the 'Men in Black' to 'abductions' and the cries of infants in the night. Throughout the book, Keel attempts to connect the dots, so to speak, inferring that all the varied phenomenon could well come from a single source. This is a big reach, but so is the book as a whole.<br />Keel proposes that these manifestations, UFO's, MIB, winged-beasts et al, possibly originate from an alternate reality - another dimension if you will. These other dimensional being(s) guide and play with the human race and have been for a very long time. Throughout history these beings have manifested in many guises and forms, according to a specific historical/social context, depending on civilizations particular belief system at the time. For example, in the middle ages, this other dimensional phenomenon showed in the form of witches, warlocks, fairies and elves. For the American Indian, the phenomenon appeared as nature spirits; and in ancient times, they manifested as winged-lions, centaurs and Olympic gods. Because of our technological advancements and predilection to anything 'scientific', they now show as flying saucers, aliens and FBI agents. In other words, Keel suggests that their form shows in the way we 'interpret' these sightings - screened through our socially conditioned minds.<br />Generally these amazing stories are told in a matter of fact tone, a journalistic style, setting the reader up from the start to lend credence to the entire book. This is clever and it works. But one gets the impression that Keel is absolutely serious about his subject matter - and to this day is trying to get to the bottom of it.

An accomplished writer of criticism, his works focus mainly on literature, covering subjects from 'Homosexuality and Art' to studies on the mechanics of biography itself. He has published portraits of many literary figures - Robert Frost, D.H. Lawrence and Ernest Hemingway, displaying an uncanny genius for research. ~Orwell - Wintry Conscience of a Generation~ is one of his more recent contributions that has given us a new and more down to earth portrayal of one of the most admired literary cult-figures in English letters. This book is not a hagiography, a monument-chiselling-excercise, creating more myth than fact: in this biography we are introduced to a human being, at times dark and disturbing, who received the calling to write somewhat late in life, and who showed a staunch integrity that today is quite rare.<br />Personally, reading Orwell is similar to sitting in the principal's office, being told in no uncertain terms the hard facts about the world, to then come away with a much firmer hold on reality. Orwell is a wake-up call, shattering any illusions you might have of a so-called just and fair society, revealing the numerous machinations of power under superficial propaganda that those in a position of influence want us to believe. While others were band wagoning, blowing any way the political and philosophical breeze was heading at the time, Orwell held fast to what he knew to be the truth - and eventually paid the price.<br />I found it interesting that Eric Blair (Orwell) suddenly dropped his career as a colonial policeman in Burma, (a truly detestable job for any man of conscience) to become a full time writer without having really written anything of significance. From the point of this 'calling', until his early death from tuberculosis at 47 years of age, wrote some of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, not to mention a myriad of essays, articles and reviews, which scholars, historians, and political scientists are pouring over to this day. Another interesting point - Orwell believed that if a writer produced anything less than 100,000 words a year, they were not doing their job. Anyone who writes professionally or other wise, knows this to be a daunting task.<br />At the beginning of Orwell's writing career, his actions showed considerable courage, a self-imposed guilt, believing that a rough, tramp-like existence was absolutely necessary: \\"...Every suspicion of self advancement, even to \\"succeed\\" in life to the extent of making a few hundreds a year, seemed to me spiritually ugly, a species of bullying...My mind turned immediately towards extreme cases, the social outcast: tramps, beggars, criminals, prostitutes...what I wanted, at the time, was to find some way of getting out of the respectable world altogether.\\" As Meyers simply explains, \\"Living rough and becoming a writer were part of the same route out of the respectable world.\\" (p.79)<br />One of my favourite novels, 'Down and Out in Paris and London', describes this conscious escape from the privileged Victorian middle class into the dark recesses of working class poverty. Orwell is of that particular writing school where, in order to write about it, you have to live it - and he did so, plunging himself continually into personal and political conflict.<br />Jeffrey Meyers has done us all a big favour, giving us a gritty astonishing portrait of a man of letters, who fought for social justice, informing us through his actions and writing the importance of personal and political integrity - Orwell is a true prophetic moralist.litical scientists are pouring over to this day.

After a little effort, finally completed reading ~Shanghai Baby~ and have been hard-pressed to make a fair commentary on its merits. As it is Hui's first novel, I don't want to be too harsh with my criticisms, (as if it really matters) but the book is terribly self-conscious, though it has a hint of innocence, a truthfulness, which should be acknowledged.<br />Curiosity brought me to this novel. The book was publicly burned and banned in China, thus my inquisitiveness concerning it contents. Apart from occasional drug use, heterosexual sex scenes, (non-graphic in nature) and adult themes, from a western perspective, the book is quite harmless. For the most part, the author pays tribute to western writers such as Allen Ginsberg, Henry Miller and Jack Kerouac. These were, of course, fringe writers of their time, whose works were censored for their rebellious themes (sex, drugs and rock and roll) so one can see what Wei Hui was attempting to emulate with this novel. I found the book hard-going at times, not for its intellectual style and content, but sheer boredom. Nothing really happens in this book -more a rambling discourse about an educated privileged Shanghai woman looking for love and wanting to be a great writer. There's no climatic epiphany concerning identity, which I found disappointing, as she's just as confused about herself at the end of the book as she was at the beginning.<br />It is possible that the book was banned because the author only pays homage to western literary influences, and says nothing at all concerning eastern literature. This was disappointing as well, because the western reader will not achieve any great insight into Chinese culture. As a culture, similar to Hong Kong, Shanghai has that unique eastern and western mix. Therefore it is not surprising that this young twenty-something artist's first novel is a search for a substantial identity. Unfortunately, though, as mentioned before, this work does not achieve this end.<br />There is no doubt, however, that Wei Hui has talent: her characters have a certain depth, and there's a keen connection with her descriptions of her physical environment - so much so, that I wanted to visit Shanghai to experience its eclectic atmosphere and exotic history.<br />Because of my natural suspicious bent, the fact that the publishers emphasised the novel's ritualistic-public burning, led me to suspect it was a marketing device to promote more sales in the west.<br />If this is true, admittedly, it worked for me.<br />To be fair, I have to give the novel three stars, not so much for it literary worth, but for Wei Hui's ambition and courage as a writer.doubt, however, that Wei Hui has talent: her characters have a certain depth, and there's a keen connection with her descriptions of her physical environment - so much so, that I wanted to visit Shanghai to experience its eclectic atmosphere and exotic history.<br />Because of my natural suspicious bent, the fact that the publishers emphasised the novel's ritualistic-public burning, led me to suspect it was a marketing device to promote more sales in the west.<br />If this is true, admittedly, it worked for me.<br />To be fair, I have to give the novel three stars, not so much for it literary worth, but for Wei Hui's ambition and courage as a writer.	2002-04-12

It was the Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, probably the most famous of Stoic philosophers, who wrote the following practical advice:<br />\\"Begin each day by saying to yourself, \\"Today I shall meet people who are interfering, ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, and selfish.\\" They are made this way because of their ignorance of what is good and evil...but I, who have seen the nature of good and beauty, and of evil and its ugliness, know that the inner nature of the man who does evil is the same as mine, therefore I can't be harmed by any of these men, for no one can impose on me what is degrading.\\"<br />In other terms, expect the worst in people, and you'll never be disappointed, and their actions will not affect you, because their nature is the same as your own.<br />Another Stoic philosopher, Seneca, had similar advice:<br />\\"...Philosophy can be a resolution against impending misfortune.\\"<br />For Seneca, the attainment of wisdom, is learned by way of our responses to reality: \\"...learning not to aggravate the world's obstinacy through our own responses, through spasms of rage, self-pity, anxiety, bitterness, self-righteousness and paranoia.\\" (p.81)<br />Similarly, it was the French existentialist philosopher, J.P. Sartre, who wrote:<br />\\"It is not what people do to you, it is what you do with what people do to you that matters.\\"<br />In Alain De Botton' book, ~The Consolations of Philosophy~ he gleans the works of some famous philosophers, who all, curiously, lived before the twentieth century, that have applicable advice for living. Avoiding those aspects of philosophy, which can wallow in abstraction, this is practical philosophy at its best, expressed in transparent terms, easy and accessible.<br />~The Consolations of Philosophy~ is a pragmatic approach to 'the love of wisdom', offering age-old tenets as remedies to prevailing human conditions.<br />De Botton begins with Socrates on the subject of conformity and his simple formula of reason in the pursuit of truth; Epicurus on happiness and his suggestions for its attainment; Montaigne on what it means to be human, rallying against received notions of imtellectualism; Schopenhauer on love, the sex-drive or 'will-to-life' and solutions for a broken heart; Nietzsche on suffering and its uses on reaching one's full potential as a human being.<br />This is not so much a self-help book, but proposed ideas for us to contemplate - to possibly slip-on like a pair of old shoes to guide us on life's journey.<br />I was singularly impressed with the last chapter, 'Consolation of Difficulties' on Nietzsche's characteristic of a noble human being: to be someone who 'no longer denies.' To deny life's negatives is to deny an important aspect of existence that contributes to the whole. We can learn through our suffering and become stronger, enabling our full potential to manifest as a process of becoming.

Mine mainly centred on the works of Kerouac and Ginsberg with a spat of McClure and Burroughs thrown in for good measure. Through the years ~Junky~ would make an appearance, however the opportunity never presented itself to crack its covers. The book would manfest from time to time, simply to remind me that it still existed. I finally read ~Junky~ last week and it blew me away.<br />Despite the fact that William S. Burroughs has been thrown into the Beat literati, ~Junky~ doesn't seem to fit. The book is a one off, an important artefact of history - a testimony to an unfortunate human predicament and a way of life that is all too real; and societies ignorance, intolerance and exploitation of the condition, and its continued hypocrisy.<br />What I found interesting is that nothing has really changed since ~Junky~ was first published two generations ago. Drug addiction is still a 'moral issue' for a lot of people, including the addiction to alcohol. To be fair, as a society, we've probably made a little progress in the last fifty years, in terms of our understanding and treatment of drugs, but there is still a long way to go.<br />William Lee, a middle class, educated individual of relative privilege, tells the story of his introduction to junk, subsequent addiction and his on-going hellish relationship with the demon. This testimony is not a posing, romantic portrayal of a hip drug user, living an artistic, bohemian existence amongst poets, painters and musicians, all creating great works of art and having a wonderful time. ~Junky~ is an honest account concerning the 'vicious circle' of addiction, and the many attempts by those afflicted to escape the circle, but once you're in it, there's really no getting out - entirely.<br />In fact it was Burroughs who coined the phrase:<br />\\"Once a junky always a junky.\\" And this is the tragedy.<br />After closing the book, I had a eerie feeling that I was holding something important in my hands. It ceased to be merely a book and became something else...a relic of a bygone era, its peculiar venacular, attitudes, dreams and nightmares. I believe it would be a mistake to include this book in any literary category for it stands alone, without pretence or device...because with ~Junky~ what you see is what you get.eeling that I was holding something important in my hands.

The truly great men in early American history, in my humble opinion, are as follows:<br />Thomas Jefferson<br />Ralph Waldo Emerson<br />Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain)<br />William James<br />Because of their intense individualism, idealistic views, and unique personalities, their writings, thoughts and ideas continue to affect western civilzation into the 21st century. Let me just say at the start - I'm not proposing a forum for argument, debating the worth and influence of one historical figure against another - these are men who have shaped my life in lasting ways - particularly the psychologist, philosopher and teacher, William James.<br />If you are interested in the works and life of this noble individual, ~Genuine Reality~ is a good place to begin. Linda Simon is an adept biographer and this book reflects her skill, understanding and love for the subject. It was refreshing to read a biography without the once fashionable 'psychoanalytical method' of interpreting history: inserting the Oedipus complex or hints of homoeroticism into the work. This method gets tedious and more reveals the biographer's mind than the subject. It is obvious that Simon wanted to approach James from a pragmatic perspective and she succeeded in showing James' life, warts and all, more specifically, however, his inspiring personality, compulsive curiosity and genuine love of life.<br />Similar to most people of genius, James' life was indeed a contradiction, at times almost enigmatic. He realized early on, that to rivet one's thought or perspective to a single dogma, to close one's mind to the infinite possibilities of existence, was to commit intellectual and spiritual suicide. Thus his thoughts are mercurial, bouncing from one possible view to another, always searching, investigating with an incessant vigour of a child. Following the works of Heraclitus, Henri Bergson, and aspects of Fredric Nietzche, James' 'Pluralism' is a philosophy of affirmation, transformation and becoming. Rallying against the Platonic and Aristotelian belief that fixity has more worth than change, he proposed that life or existence is not fixed at all but involved in an on-going state of flux: the operating word is change. And his life certainly reflects this perspective, as Simon writes:<br />&quot;He was a scientist with a disposition of a philosopher and a philosopher with the perspective of an artist. He was convinced of his own essential complexity: certain that his public personality contradicted a hidden, more authentic self. He championed the new, he hungered for astonishment.&quot;<br />At the core of James' view of life is to maintain a continual openness to our existence: attempt to create a kind of vital joy to life's infinite possibilities. In other terms, do not sit back and merely observe, but get your hands dirty, engage, and life will give back to you many fold.<br />~Genuine Reality~ is an important contribution to American history. Linda Simon is a genuine biographer with transparent humility, more concerned with presenting her subject as it is, rather than trying to show off her knowledge, wit and writing skills. All too often, biographer's egos get in the way: they become so involved in revealing their intellectual capacity, the subject of the biography falls by the wayside. Not so with this text.<br />This book is an intimate portrayal of a great man's life: his interesting and unusual family, his work and relationships, and his sometimes-underrated contribution to philosophy. Out of all of James' writings, there is a line that showed me, in essence, the true character of the man:<br />&quot;Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways: I will do somebody a good turn and Not be found out. I will do two things I Don't want to do.&quot;<br />This biography is recommended without reservation.inst the Platonic and Aristotelian belief that fixity has more worth than change, he proposed that life or existence is not fixed at all but involved in an on-going state of flux: the operating word is change.

This special novel passively sat on the bookshelf in my study for sometime. Over the months, occasionally, it would wink at me... I would pick it up, thumb through its pages, read the odd line or two, and place it back on the shelf. On a Sunday morning last week, I read the beginning line for the first time:<br />\\"It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York. I'm stupid about executions.\\"<br />Needless to say, I read ~The Bell Jar~ from start to finish, and have had a suspicious and disturbing dark cloud hanging around me ever since. This dark cloud mingles with intermittent light, but the shadow of the novel's themes moves into my vicinity like a suspected stalker, waiting in the corner, seemingly ready to pounce without warning. This may well sound a tad too dramatic, but their are novels out there that have the power to influence your state of mind in profound ways. This novel, for me at any rate, turned out to be one such book.<br />The story is a realistic account of a young American girl's descent into madness.<br />Similar to many great American writers, her prose style is deceptively simple. Plath's writing is extraordinarily translucent, enabling the reader to vicerally connect with her inner most thoughts and feelings. This aspect of the novel was highly enjoyable rather than the actual story itself. Sometimes reality is difficult to look at...<br />As a poet, Plath is acutely sensitive to the world, and as sensitive people are forced to do, they create social masks as a defence mechanism against the vulgarities of existence. This reminded me of the Aestheticism of the Irish writer and poet, Oscar Wilde: the poet's task in life is to be a seeker of beauty - the art of life, or the life of art, the aesthete or poet equates with a form of purified ecstasy that can flourish only when removed from the vulgarities and sterotyped world of actuality. In the case of the novel's protagonist, Esther Greenwood, it was a confrontation and eventual withdrawl from the vulgarities of 'male culture'. The mask she created revealed itself as an unkind, almost flippant attitude to the people around her. Because she must be true to herself, (as poets must be) her actions or inactions with the people around her caused tremendous guilt, thus the vicious circle begins: an acute sensitivity to the world and self; the creation of a false mask as defence; the inevitable guilt for not being true to oneself, leading to eventual self destruction.<br />There are no knights in shining armour in this tale. Sir Galahad riding over the hill on his trusty stead to save poor Esther Greenwood from herself and others. On the contrary, most of the major male characters in ~The Bell Jar~ (apart from her father who is dead) are pathetic losers: coarse, insensitive and self absorbed.<br />~The Bell Jar~ Plath's only novel before her tragic suicide, thrust her directly into the feminist arena, making her a feminist 'icon' in American culture. This accolade is well deserved as this book is a major contribution to the cause, exposing male dominance and oppression, (more so then, fortunately, than now) and illustrating that women are not simply baby machines, cooks, house cleaners, and mere objects for male sexual gratification.<br />After finishing this book, I couldn't help making a comparison to Viginia Woolf's modernist masterpiece, ~Mrs Dalloway~. In this novel, similar themes are explored: male vulgarity, the arrogance of the medical profession, and madness.<br />This is an important book for many reasons, least of which is its literary contribution to American letters.<br />Highly recommended.st, Esther Greenwood, it was a confrontation and eventual withdrawl from the vulgarities of 'male culture'.

He wrote the following:<br />&quot;Now I have finished and am thinking about the dream book again. I have been looking into the literature and feel like a Celtic imp.&quot;Oh, how I am glad that no one, no one knows...&quot; No one suspects that the dream is not nonsense but wish fulfillment.&quot;<br />Indeed, this is the premise of Freud's entire thesis: dreams are no more than repressed unconscious wishes, battling for expression and consummation.<br />In his own words, Freud had 'dared' to rally against the 'objections of severe science, to take the part of the ancients and of superstition.' In 1900, the official year of the book's publication, its reception, despite its provoctive title, was tepid, and in the course of six years, only sold 351 copies. Freud never gave up hope, and 30 years later, in the preface of the third English edition, he wrote, &quot;It contains, even according to my present day judgement, the most valuable of all the discoveries it has been my good fortune to make. Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once a lifetime.' In present day, one can question any Freud scholar about ~The Interpretation of Dreams~ and they will say the same thing: the book contains everything that 'is' psychoanalysis.<br />Anyone interested in the history of psychoanalysis and the mind of Sigmund Freud, reading this book is an absolute must. The reading runs along too, quite easily, as Freud was an excellent writer: his unique prose style even shines through some clumsy translations.<br />If you are interested in the book's process of development, I would suggest reading ~The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm Fliess~; another gold mine for understanding the  growth of psychoanalysis.	2002-02-06

One can hear the last remaining explosions over the literary and academic landscape. After twenty years the battle is finally coming to an end: the French deconstructionists are at last packing up their word processors and going home. Like all wars, this so-called \\"cultural war\\" was pointless, fuelled by ivory tower academics in fear of losing tenure - at least this is the reason given by American academic, Richard Schwartz, in his curious book, ~ After the Death of Literature~.<br />Schwartze notes that the Cultural Wars of the eighties and nineties are over and that literature, as a subject and artform, has the task of reconstructing itself from the ruins created by traditionalists and, later, post-structuralists. In pursuit of this task, he constructs a foundation in which literature, as a subject of critical theory, might rise from the ashes like a phoenix after a 500 year slumber. Schwartz uses the eighteenth century critic, scholar, lexicographer, poet and man of letters, Samuel Johnson, as his model for this new literary view. According to Schwartz, the true Johnsonian critic sees literature \\"as part of the totality of human experience and...resist(s) the temptation of narrow focus and narrow specialization.\\" Schwartz believes that this has been a major problem with the subject of literature within the academic domain: we have become too theoritical and specialized, thus analysing the subject of literature out of existence. The excesseses of \\"literary theory\\" in the last thirty-five years have, to a greater or lesser degree, taken our focus off literature's purpose as an artform - to broaden and deepen human endeavor on issues such as \\"love and hate, hope and memory, the individual and society and dozens of others of equally high importance.\\"<br />In so many words, the critic has become king and the artist, the writer and the poet have been relegated to the status of second class citizen.<br />This book is another attempt (and a successful one) at French 'critical theory' bashing. Having just read Camille Paglia's, ~Art, Sex and American Culture~ (see my review) both texts are quite similar on the subject: Schwartz is much more sedate, however, Paglia gives it to them (French academics and their cronies) with both barrels.<br />Generally, the conclusion of this important book is, that, in order for literature to survive and develop as an academic subject and art form, the specialized academics must come down from their ivory towers and make the subject accessible to all. Otherwise literature could possibly specialize itself into oblivion.<br />If you are interested in the \\"Cultural Wars\\" that rampaged through out academia in America and Australia in the last two decades of the twentieth century, you'll find this book curious and interesting.

Literature in many respects is very similar to music. In order to catch the subtle nuances, the beauty or message of the piece, requires more than one sitting. A single piece can appear deceptively simple on the first hearing or reading. But on closer examination, the book, poem or song takes on a more complex significance; you find yourself pouring over the work time and time again, digging deeper into its potential meaning. J.M. Coetzee's ~The Lives of Animals` is one such example.<br />This book is short, simple but elegantly written; containing ideas and arguments that could well take weeks to adequately unpack to reach a semblance of understanding of the many issues it proposes we ponder. In short, the novel concerns itself with the contentious issue of animal rights. More specifically, animal cruelty, in regards to our treatment of the edible, warm blooded variety: cattle, poultry et al. Reaching for a hard hitting comparison to make his point, Coetzee uses the Nazi concentrations camps and the genocide of the Jews as an example of how we currently treat and prepare the animals for slaughter in the henhouses and abattoirs around the planet. This comparison is flawed to some extent, (which a character in the novel points out) but Coetzee manages to make the similarities work as the novel progresses and the arguments are fleshed-out. However this is not the main thesis of the book.<br />The central question the book proposes we consider is whether animals have consciousness. And if they do have 'reasoning' consciousness, how can we justify their slaughter for our own gain? Our current Darwinian view of the world, that is, human beings hovering at the top of some evolutionary hierarchy, and all other living things falling in neat categories below, at the end of the 19th century, paved the way for some pretty horrific wars and some juicy justifications for the crimes committed in the 20th century. The Nazis used Darwin and his theories to justify their massive slaughter of Jews, gypsies, homosexuals and avant-garde artists, particularly the German Expressionists, calling it 'degenerative art'. Are animal's mere biological automatons? Are they 'degenerate', and therefore an easy target for exploitation? And if animals do have consciousness, what rights do they have?<br />This is not the place to launch into the arguments of animal rights or human rights for that matter. But what Coetzee has done with this exceptional book, is to present these important issues and complex philosophical arguments in a fictional format, enabling the subject to be more accessible to anyone interested in the way we treat our fellow creatures.<br />Spend an hour reading this book; then read it again - you will not be disappointed.ughter of Jews, gypsies, homosexuals and avant-garde artists, particularly the German Expressionists, calling it 'degenerative art'.

Having been a Crichton fan for many years and finally opening ~Jurassic Park~ over the Christmas break was well worth the time and effort. I don't understand why I left it so long: probably the absurd amount of hype during its release and the subsequent film. A book or film that is on 'everyone's lips' and constantly advertised ad nausea, I have a tendency to avoid like the plague. In this case, it was a mistake. ~Jurassic Park~ is a beauty.<br />It is no secret that Crichton has been endlessly criticised for formula-driven plots and one-dimensional characters. This may be true, but the formula works and his characters drive the story along.<br />~ Jurassic Park~ is one hell of a good idea for a book. Even though the novel is over a decade old, the premise is still as relevant as ever. Scientists bent on making 'the' discovery and not thinking about the consequences of their actions. I was reminded of what a scientist said on the Manhatten Project after exploding the A bomb in New Mexico before dropping it on Japan: &quot;Now we're all son's of bitches.&quot; DNA research having altruistic potential to cure disease is one thing, but as ~Jurassic Park~ illustrates, there is a dark side to science, particularly when tinkering with the fundamentals of life.<br />The Malcolm monologues, informed and cynical, are a pure delight. He communicates man's total arrogance when it comes to nature and the desire to control it.<br />&quot;When a hunter goes out in the rain forest to seek food for his family, does he expect to control nature? No. You decide you'll control nature, and from that moment on you're in trouble. You're powers are much less than your dreams of reason would have you believe.&quot; (351)<br />After two books, ~Jurassic Park~ and ~The Lost World~, and three films, it is most likely people are overdosed on dinosaurs. But if you haven't read this book, take the plunge, for it is not only about Raptors and T-Rex's causing havoc. It's about the dangers of science, life and our modern views of the world.<br />An enjoyable read.e, life and our modern views of the world.<br />An enjoyable read.	2002-01-14

Camille Paglia is a breath of fresh air; a provocative slayer of highbrow, smug, one-dimensional academics, who, over the last twenty five years, have been waving French Critical theory around like it was a major break through in western thought. She treats these 'gurus' of French academe, i.e., Derrida, Lacan, and Foucault like purveyors of a death fog, confusing all and sunder with their 'playful language', their philosophy of destruction or 'deconstruction', and reveals the end result of this post structuralist cancer: 'Academics with the souls of accountants...' an alarming ignorance of history and true scholarship, and a specialized factory line mentality in undergraduate studies.<br />All of the essays in this wonderful collection sparkle with erudition, honesty and guts. I was actually startled by Paglia's frankness, power and arresting prose style. A friend, who suggested I read this book, summed Paglia up quite nicely, &quot;She has turned cultural studies into a contact sport.&quot; It's about time. Having been on the receiving end of the Derrida, Lacan, Foucault triad, as an idealistic, hungry for knowledge undergraduate, I too was swept-up in the French theory furore, anally strutting around campus like some initiated witch from a secret coven. History has shown that the attainment of alleged esoteric knowledge has always given us a false sense of power: a feeling that you are somehow a member of the elite, above the fray, someone special. After a few years, however, the illusion crumbled, and I realized that to view language as nothing more than 'meaningless play'; that, at bottom, all this so-called 'rebelliousness' was simply empty rhetoric and posing claptrap, and really has no use in the world of physical reality. I needed to do something, so switched the game plan, and began reading the canon. Suddenly, the penny dropped, and connections began to manifest. Homer's ~The Odyssey~ changed my life and true learning began in earnest.<br />Another area of criticism that rang true in this important book is the move towards specialization in the halls of humanities departments across the globe. Paglia explains this shift as a self-promoting defence mechanism for academics without courage. I don't know about the teacher side of the story, but from a student's perspective, specialization has been devastating in some instances. For example, a friend of mine has a degree in 'cultural studies' hanging proudly on his wall, and his knowledge of Elizabethan literature is profound. Ironically, however, his knowledge of popular culture is next to nil. How can anyone claim higher knowledge in cultural studies without an appreciation of ~The Simpsons~ or the political ramifications of Mickey Mouse. Because of specialization, Paglia believes universities have been churning out cultural morons with limited knowledge of the world. It is a dangerous situation. To fix the problem, Paglia suggests an interdisciplinary approach to education, which includes the sciences, art history, comparative religion and politics as well as literature. Generally, learning of our rich past is about making connections,encompassing all the disciplines from the beginning of western knowledge to present time.<br />Camille Paglia is an academic rabble-rouser; an astute observer of popular culture and a no holds barred bitch with a well-argued point of view. Her understanding of cinema and their gods, i.e., Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor and Alfred Hitchcock reveals deep insight into the American psyche: a pleasure to read.<br />The one criticism I have of this book is Paglia's feeble views on rape. Her argument that &quot;if you look for trouble you'll get it'; a young girl wearing a thong and a see-through dress at an all male fraternity party is merely asking for it, is a narrow and superficial perspective. What about the eighty year old woman, living in the same street for years, walking to the baker and the butcher, known by everybody, to be found brutally raped and beaten for no apparent reason. Was she asking for it? Hardly. However contentious Paglia's arguments on this issue may seem, they smell of eastern wealth, a target market for her publisher to shake-up an intellectually frustarated clientele. The issue of rape goes far beyond the privleged schoolgirl scenario.<br />That said, ~Sex, Art, and American Culture is the viper-jewel in Cleopatra's crown, instructing the fat - comfort zone - Mark Anthony's of American academe to get a grip, pull their fingers out and follow their instincts.<br />This book is highly recommended.g and a see-through dress at an all male fraternity party is merely asking for it, is a narrow and superficial perspective.

His life and work exemplifies the libertine ethos, that is, \\"rules are meant to be broken, that the laws of religion and society are artificial limitations without intrinsic value, and that the only law is the law of nature that authorizes any action for the sake of pleasure.\\" (359) The irony, however, is that the king of libertinism spent the majority of his life behind bars, pushing the bounderies, breaking the rules of imposed morality with only his pen and an imagination geared to fulfil his every bent desire. As Schaeffer points out, the greater irony was behind the 18th century pomp and circumstance of the French aristocracy, de Sade's '120 Days of Sodom' barely scratches the surface of how these priviliged wigged lunatics really spent their time. De Sade's true nemesis was a woman: Mme de Montreuil - de Sade's mother in law. She wanted the man out of the way and she succeeded without question.<br />As a study of character and the way the human mind reacts while incarcerated, this book is a revelation. Of course, similar to most criminals, de Sade believed himself to be innocent; his predicament was always someone else's fault. To a large extent, he was right. But paranoia is a strong emotion, an exaggerated fear of the world against you: jailed for decades for no apparent \\"real\\" reason, one's mind will find a reason. Conspiracy theories provide answers and meaning to one's life - or at least an explanation for one's suffering. De Sade's theories, understandably, went beyond the pale. If anything, this biography is a fine study of how far a creative mind will reach for answers when backed against a wall. The letters between de Sade and his wife, Renee, while in prison, would be substantial material for any in-depth study or research project on the intricacies of paranoia. Renee would be the subject of another biographical study of equal stature to de Sade. What a fascinating individual. Reading only the fragments of these letters in the book is worth the time.<br />The Marquis de Sade would like us to believe that he is a martyr, a victim of hypocricy and social power. This book certainly argues this view well. But de Sade is about extremes; taking our base desires and making them realities, and philosophically justifying these base desires as natural. This argument doesn't work, because to live in society we must abide by the social contract - otherwise there is no society. De Sade, through his literature, showed us how far the imagination could travel to its darkest depths. Compared to the horrors of the twentieth century, however, de Sade's sexual and cruel exploits seem almost quaint.<br />Reading this book is well worth the effort, if one is interested in the nature of power, the intricacies of paranoia, and an honest account of a man of letters who ranks amongst the best. Neil Schaeffer should be commended.swers when backed against a wall.

Of course this is what he wants us to believe. In reality, he is a murderous thug with delusional albeit grand ideals.<br />This book can be read on many levels. As readers, however, we are positioned from the outset to see the book in a particular way: \\"From a civilized view, Read is a monster. The question is: What made him like that? Was he born or made that way? These are interesting points to ponder.\\" After reading these lines from the editors, apart from the anemic nature/nurture theory they propose we ponder, I couldn't help returning to the word \\"civilized\\". As a so-called civilization, we are conditioned to see violence as something separate, an aspect of ourselves that is somehow unnatural, but can be unleashed when it suits us. As Read says in his book, \\"Posh people love gangters.\\" What I find curious is Chopper (with a little marketing help) has positioned himself squarley in this tradition; and has made the image fit firmly in Australian popular culture.<br />In a way this book is a paradox: on the one hand it exalts violence to romantic proportions, then, weakly, condems it. \\"Don't do as I do, do as I say.\\" \\"Don't live a life of extreme violence and crime like me, kids, but aren't I a really cool gangster?\\" Dangerous.<br />For those of you who would like to gain greater insight into Melbourne's underworld and prisons, then this book is for you. If you're the kind of person who enjoys graphic violence in the extreme, buy and read this book.<br />Otherwise, skip it.	2001-07-18

The legendary writer if the Beat Generation, Jack Kerouac, when writing his experimental work, Mexico City Blues, attempted to achieve a synthesis between his prose and the jazz sounds of the mythical saxophonist, Charlie Parker. In a letter to William Burroughs, he describes at length, sitting in the subteranean world of the San Fransisco bar scene, a bourbon clinched in one hand and a pen in the other, lost in a fit of Dionysian abandon, recording the notes and improvisational screams of the music, pushing the bounderies of received notions of art beyond the imposed limits of the bourgeoise - this was indeed a new art form in the making.<br />In a collaboration between writer and artist, Tofts and McKeitch have produced a work that beautifully intergrates prose and image. Memory Trade explores the antecedents of a much over used and abused term: Cyberculture. This word, (which was originally coined by the Canadian science fiction writer, William Gibson in 1980) has become so much a part of popular culture, that we flipantly assume we understand what it means. Nothing can be further from the truth. Memory Trade brilliantly removes the 'Spice Girls factor' from the term, and takes the reader on a kind of archeological expedition to a time before the birth of Christ, uncovering the secrets of cyberculture's very beginnings.<br />This book is not your standard history text that conservatively presents the reader with  a chronological format of time, place form and event. As Tofts states, Memory Trade is &quot;not trying to present a genealogy of concatenation, of neatly linked motivations and actions, but rather to contruct a narrative of syncopation, of shifting emphases and digressions in word and image.&quot; In other words, the insights gained in this text concerning the prehistory of cyberculture, have come about, sufaced, as a result of abductive thinking, as oppossed to typical, deductive methods of reasoning. More to the point, Memory Trade is an investigation into cybercultures's unconscious; a quest towards unexpolored realms; a hunt for the unexpected - &quot;an examination of technologizing the world&quot;.<br />This is not to say, of course, that the book reads like a postmodern text, jumping in some non-sequential, non-linear format. Memory Trade is exhaustively well researched and argues its subject matter in an elegant, persuasive manner. In many 'academic' texts, for example, the prose, in an effort to appear erudite, are couched in specialized terms that actually hide more than they reveal. This book, on the other hand, enlightens, because it is written in a well organized 'user friendly' manner. In fact, for those of you who have only a casual interest in cyberculture, this book should educate as well as entertain.<br />I should also stress that McKeitch is not simply the 'illustrator' of the book. These extraordinary images that he has produced carry as much weight and significance as the words. More precisely, the book is a multi-timed text, that, to a great extent, should be read in a milieu of both image and text, as the book achieves a synthesis of both word and picture.<br />Look for this book and read it. It will be well worth the trouble.into cybercultures's unconscious; a quest towards unexpolored realms; a hunt for the unexpected - &quot;an examination of technologizing the world&quot;.<br />This is not to say, of course, that the book reads like a postmodern text, jumping in some non-sequential, non-linear format.

The mark of an excellent piece of writing is the invisibility of the prose. Picking up a book and stumbling on the words, the phrases, the writing itself, always gets in the way of a good story. A well-written story creates a situation for the reader, where, for the most part, that necessary 'suspension of disbelief' occurs, and you find yourself lost in the world of the tale. It ceases to be merely reading and becomes something else. In Frank Huyler's The Blood of Strangers, the world of the emergency room emerges from the doctor's point of view with such terrifying reality, that putting the book down, taking a break, is utterly necessary to maintain one's perspective, one's own reality. Huyler doesn't write prose, but conjures windows into another world.<br />This book is a collection of scenes from the ER, revealing an aspect of the medicos that a lot of us would rather not know. First year medical students, for example, are assigned a cadaver to mutilate, take apart, to gain first-hand knowledge of human anatomy. This is the first of many hoops that the medical student must jump through in their many years of intense training. There is a tacit reason why anatomy is the first course off the rank - it is a test as to whether they have the capacity to objectify the body as mere object, divorce feeling and emotion from the human form itself. Many fail because they lack that 'scientific objectivity' and cannot stomach using a hack saw to open the skull of their subject. It is too close to home. The terrifying aspect of The Blood of Strangers is the objectivity portrayed by Dr. Huyler - he communicates a kind of coldbloodedness coupled with a profound insight and affinity with the human soul. He is at once human and inhuman, insensitive monster and caring priest - but above all, a man doing a job that most of would rather leave to someone else.<br />Most all the stories told have something to teach us about the profession. Medical doctors and surgeons are a breed apart - it is almost as if they are born to the task, and their power over life and death is nothing less than astounding.<br />The Blood of Strangers is a realistic insight into the mind and experience of a doctor. The book is a strange journey for the uninitiated, and a lesson in the utter fragility of human life - something we should never take for granted.<br />This book is highly recommended.t - it is almost as if they are born to the task, and their power over life and death is nothing less than astounding.<br />The Blood of Strangers is a realistic insight into the mind and experience of a doctor.

In one of the shorter stories, Sugar, a little girl is brought into the ER because she is just 'acting a bit weird'. The father wants to forget the whole thing and take her home, while the mother instinctively perceives something amiss. Dr. Huyler asks all the appropriate questions and comes up with nothing, until he is about to leave the room, he has a second thought: &quot;Is there any chance she might have gotten into someone's medication? Does anyone in the family take medications regularly?&quot; As it turns out, through a process of logical interrogation, it is discovered that the little girl has overdosed on oral hypoglycemics, sugar pills, and would have died if not treated. This particular story is one of the lesser terrifying incidents, but shows us the fragility of the human condition and the vast responsibilty that burdens the medical profession.<br />The Blood of Strangers is a realistic insight into the mind and experience of a doctor.

Existential angst at its best, Dellilo's THE BODY ARTIST explores the human condition: being-in-the-world, identity, time passing and defining oneself in terms of the 'other'. These are fashionable post modern concerns that have been discussed for the last thirty years. The novel is an excellent medium in which to explore these ideas, and the author has done a wonderful job. Always pushing the use of language, Dellilo's prose is a pleasure to read. One can see the immense thought put into every sentence, paragraph and page. I wanted to avoid the adjective -haunting - but this particular word adequetly describes THE BODY ARTIST. I recommend this book to anyone who is serious about literature. Excellent.	2001-04-14

I had read WHITE NOISE years ago and was surprised by the book's originality, depth and particularly the adeptness of the dialogue. Stumbling onto THE NAMES was an accident, but as Freud once said, &quot;There are no accidents.&quot;; and found this book even more compelling and strange. Delillo is a master of description and dialogue, touching on epic themes from a slightly bent perspective. That's what makes him such a wonderful author - giving his readers the opportunity to see the world in all its mundaneness from new perspectives. As a 'postmodern' writer, he plays with form yet manages to maintain that so needed aspect of a novel - the story. Playing with the artifice is all fine and dandy, but it can get pretty annoying when the story is lost. Delillo has surpassed many modern writers with his originality and approach to the novel. THE NAMES is a gem. Excellent reading.	2001-04-09

As America's major 'bookchat' academics, Bloom's latest, 'How to Read and Why', is disturbing and disapointing. If I can be so bold, the book is also hypocritical, stating to leave 'ideology' out of one's reading of literature, by and while pushing the stance that all modern works inevitably lead back to Rome; in this case, William Shakespeare. The curious Kabalist treatise at the end, an ideology in and of itself, is quite disturbing. He damns ideology while pushing his own. Literary criticism has moved on Mr. Bloom. We've discovered it is worthwhile analysing historical context as well as irony, paradox, etc. One can study outside the text as well as the text itself and still enjoy or be inspired or change one's view of existence for the better. Interestingly, I had thought the 'New Critic' school was long gone, or at least incorporated into criticism overall, only to find the old boy's still around. Pushing the same old arguments, the same old song and dance.	2001-04-02

The book is a well- crafted, well- researched analysis of 'the' American philosopher of the 19th century. After completing the work, I felt as though I knew the great man intimately, and found myself feeling sad that he wasn't in the phone book or had an email address to invite him and his family over for dinner. As Thoreau once wrote, &quot;Surely joy is the condition of life.&quot; And this is most certainly the leading emotion that I felt while reading this book. And as Emerson wrote: &quot;The purpose of life is individual cultivation, self expression, and fulfillment.&quot; At the risk of sounding too praiseworthy, Richardson's commendable biography has given me  the opportunity to experience all three of the above. Since a freshman in highschool, my predelication to Transcedentalism has moved in and out of my life like a warm breeze. This particular work has re-lit this old philosophical spark,causing the winds to rise again, so to speak, creating a kind of intellectual excitment. I have read hundreds of biographies on many great individuals, but this one ranks as one of the best. I recommend this book highly.	2001-01-11
