Parts of the book are excellent. But it doesn't hang together successfully. Author desperately needs a good editor and someone to critique. But I would read his next book. Hope it's better.  <br /> <br />The book starts out pretty well, though the descriptions of everything in the beginning are overdone. The author's scientific training shows, and clearly he is an acute observer. <br /> <br />Having read the whole thing, I give it a 2 on a scale of 1 to 5. It's way too long, and he drops these weird little characters in all over who make little sense. Quite a few subplots, many of which don't go anywhere. That's OK, but the whole book degenerates into a B movie script with these psycho comic book characters and absurd plot twists that bounce from place to place. ( \\"Dr. Pain\\" and the Devil-Satyrs and piles of human bones in a cave?)  <br /> <br />He also has everyone suddenly falling on the ground and weeping or having fits all the time (hardened military leaders for example) because the \\"angelic heroine\\" (who boinks with both men and women while resting in her Christian faith - I suppose that's accurate enough in the deep south?) has been captured by the space aliens and is being tortured.  <br /> <br />Everyone falls apart like Daffy duck on a bad day at the slightest mention of space aliens too - from the beginning. Rather like hearing, \\"Ta-DUM! every time \\"space alien\\" is said while watching a stage play. Or it's sort of like watching a B movie in which everyone cries all the time and dirge music is played throughout. Quite tiresome and so unrealistic.  <br /> <br />Then there are these funny things dropped in like \\"Suddenly the Pleaideians flying saucer spots the astronauts who have drifted away from the shuttle and can't get back.\\" Yeah. Right. And 3/4 of the way through the book you find out that this (of course gorgeous) female from the Pleaides can teleport? And there are these other \\"drop-in\\" aliens who drive around in Lincoln Town cars that float instead of have wheels (somehow nobody notices?) and these guys all look like squat Bulgarian hit men in black trench coats? And they live inside of dingy freight containers in an old warehouse? And they don't bathe? For the love of Mike - why? I'm sorry, I can't justify that. And then the S&M scene for the heroine... Yeah, I finished it because I said I would. But lordy it got very weird.  <br />  <br />The author has his physics down, I'll say that, which one would expect so given his profession as rocket scientist. But his biology is ridiculous. Somehow these evil gray aliens don't share our chemistry or ancestry and yet are able to create human-alien hybrids? (Say what?) And there are not one, but two species of other (mostly nice) space aliens who look exactly like us and want to steal our women?  It's rather comical to a biologist or MD. :-)   Come, come. If an author is going to have aliens stealing our beautiful young women for breeding experiments, fun and frolic, you have to explain how they could possibly be interested, or how it could work.  <br /> <br />That would be counteracted except - there the only message to the book I got was \\"god will help you if you pray in a tight spot, and there are evil people, and maybe space aliens are the satanic demons from hell.\\" But then, kerplop, one of the bad aliens is quite nice and talks like a new-age biff brain who can calculate numbers to 20 decimal places like a computer.  I didn't really find a thread of something to say except the action line - which is less than some Batman comics have. Oh, dear.  <br />  <br />There is a cult movie that made a lot of money called \\"Killer Clowns From Outer Space\\". If his book was a movie he might get a following just because it was so weird. College students would go see it and roll in the aisles.  <br /> <br />But - the book has some very good passages, which is why I think this author should continue to write. I see this book as \\"flushing the tanks\\" for this author - clearing things out so something better can come out. It takes time to become a good or great writer, just like it takes time to become a good scientist. More power too him - and I look forward to his next work.	2005-08-20

I found a big hole in the novel to be that Monroe Hall was supposed to have kept all his passwords and bank accounts in his head.  <br /> <br />Guarantee you - nobody with a lot of money overseas would do that. They would hide the numbers and passwords somewhere. Too much risk of losing them.  <br /> <br />Most likely place to hide them would be in an encrypted datastore on Monroe's computer, and there would be a CD with the file in a safe deposit box somewhere.  <br /> <br />Also, with such a famous guy, the bankers would possibly notice, even overseas. They watch CNN also. They would contact next of kin. Or, they might wait until Monroe dies. But probably they would track him down.  <br /> <br />I liked having all the subplots and different characters. It was not so boring as most plots.	2005-08-06
US	45675105	R3ABFZZPZJQXAP	0553560735	710568866	Red Mars (Mars Trilogy)	Books	4	9	14	N	N	Really excellent with small flaws	Robinson has a very specific style with these books, Red, Green and Blue Mars. I think Red is the best of the series, but all of them have their strengths.  <br /> <br />What I liked most is that it was fairly like life. Yeah, I know most people seem to want escapist junk, but this is SF in the tradition of Heinlein's and Asimov's earlier work - though with a unique style. He pays attention to real science and doesn't postulate something outrageous that isn't ever going to happen. He makes very real characters, and takes you skipping across the years.  <br /> <br />Maybe, like Clarke, this is something that authors can do as they get older and have more perspective.  <br /> <br />My comments are mostly with two things, one of which wasn't known when Robinson wrote Red Mars. The first is when he constantly talks about the fines, micron sized particles that get into everything and on everything.  <br /> <br />The problem with fines like that is that they have a well documented respiratory effect. They cause diseases like \\"black lung\\" and \\"silicovolcanoconiosis\\" or \\"tin miner's disease\\" or \\"asbestosis\\". So this is an inconsistency in the story, because fines that small get into the alveoli, get attacked by white blood cells, kill the white blood cells and the result is scarring and death. Based on the descriptions in the Red Mars book, the fines would have killed everyone within 10 years or so.  <br /> <br />The second problem is one Robinson didn't know about, that is still uncertain. Chromium has been detected on Mars' surface in surprising quantities. So it's part of the dust. The problem with that is that if, as is quite likely, much of it is in the hexavalent form of Chromium, it will cause tumors in mammals very rapidly. Since the Mars settlers are described as living in a virtual bath of fines, they would probably get large amounts of hexavalent chromium into their water, absorb it through their mouth and saliva swallowing and things like that. The average timefor them to develop tumors would be around 4 years, for many within 1 year. (This is the stuff that the movie \\"Erin Brokavich\\" was based on.)  <br /> <br />So those details kept bothering me. Until a water cycle gets going to wash the fines out, settle them into soil and dissolve the chromium so it can react, I don't think the story as it is told could possibly happen. The settlers would have to live hermetically sealed, or much better so. Maybe genetically engineered people could handle it.  <br />	2005-06-07

It's good to know some of these things.  <br /> <br />Caught a typo where he describes the Jerboa having a tale (instead of tail). A gaffe where he says that proteins are the keys to genes. (Should be DNA, although proteins are integral to the form and functioning of chromosomes.)  <br /> <br />All in all a great read. I was surprised he didn't mention Cabeza de Vaca's ordeal of survival walking across from Florida to Spanish settlement in Mexico almost 500 years ago after being shipwrecked.  <br /> <br />I've had the thought sometimes of working on a field medicince support book that would give directions for how to make a scalpel, how to anesthetize a patient, and things like that in primitive conditions. I thought about that after spending some time with a Russian born and trained former military physician who knew a tremendous amount about how to walk in with nothing at all but bare hands and knowledge. I don't have all that knowledge, but somebody should compile it.  <br /> <br />Like the old guys would say - \\"Never say die kid! Just get up again, no matter what.\\"	2005-02-27

I'll give this guy a break because it's a rare person who goes and writes a nearly professional book by himself about his own story. He needed a better editor is what he needed.  <br /> <br />I found the interspersed bits to be a bit annoying because they broke the flow. But those bits are easy to skip over, and one can find where the tale picks up again. A good editor should have let him know that. But each one was well written of itself. He's a talented writer, just not experienced yet. But even that's not a fair comment. Even experienced writers like JK Rowling lose it without good editing. (Witness the last interminable potboiler, nearly lacking in humor from the Harry Potter series.) So I lay what flaws are there on the editors.  <br /> <br />As a result, he comes off as a bit of a slow learner and self centered to those who are distant from such things. But I don't think that's real or fair. For those who have never been into such risk taking and challenges, it all must seem rather stupid and harebrained. But really it isn't so - no more than injuries sustained boxing, or in gymnastics, or even football (American football) or rugby. All those sports require facing serious dangers and a pretty much everyone who plays them gets hurt, often quite badly. Some get crippled or die. But people still love to play, and will go running back out there as long as they can.  <br /> <br />That's how I read his interspersed accounts. It was his way of saying, \\"This is my sport, and I love it.\\" He wouldn't have it differently even if it kills him, and he knows that it kills some like him every year.  So, sure, I no longer have the impulse to get up and risk my life in ice and snow and wind. But I've risked it, and recieved serious injury from gymnastics and bicycling.  <br /> <br />It's a very well written and honest story from someone who went to the edge of dying and came back by the skin of his teeth. I don't think he's \\"stuck on himself\\" at all. He's a fun loving young guy who has made a life for himself that he loves, with good friends. Not for everyone, but what is? How many people want to get in the boxing ring? How many want to do rings bad enough to do it?  <br /> <br />What is life without some risk? This guy was very experienced. He did a short day hike that should have been no big deal at all. Got snagged on a freak boulder.  <br /> <br />And   cut   off    his    hand.  <br /> <br />Most of us would have died.	2005-01-16

Characters are developed toward richness, but there are some obvious mistakes. Several of the very young teen characters who are described as unschooled come out with erudite lines that could only spring from the brain of a much older and well read adult. It also sets up expectations by stating things like that the passenger would learn what it was to die alone, but then that just doesn't happen, with no explanation.  <br /> <br />Similarly, I found it very hard to swallow the idea that a kid who goes on the lam at 7 learns enough sophisticated spaceship engineering by the age of 12 from crawling around in ventilation ducts on a planetoid to get hired on? Come on. A little bit of work it might take to learn differential equations maybe?  <br /> <br />I kept reading it though, because of the obvious talent of the writer whom I had never read before. Hoped it would get better, but it didn't quite step up.  <br /> <br />The story is basically a downhill run of slow motion disaster. Supremely uninspiring, just goes downhill and goes downhill. It gets inside the heads of a group of people who are so self centered and incapable of human communication as to be stunning. At the same time, quite a number of them are performing jobs requiring a semblance of genius.  <br /> <br />I didn't see what the point was, exactly. That was how I felt at the end. OK. And?  <br />	2005-01-15

Incredible work from Gavin Menzies	This book is pretty long and so full of all kinds of facts and very well thought out ideas. It took me a couple of weeks to finish it.  <br /> <br />But this is a book that everyone should read. It is so clear, so convincing. There is really no arguing with it.  <br /> <br />Someone should make a new movie about 1492, and a whole series about 1421-1423. It makes more sense now that Columbus thought that he had reached China, or Chinese territory. There were Chinese artifacts there, and he had heard reports of Chinese ships coming across the Atlantic from the area of the Grand Banks.  <br /> <br />Can't go into it all here. Just an amazing book of amazing work.

Has anyone checked that he really was with Muhammad Ali? That should be easy.  <br /> <br />Also, there's this basic problem here. This guy claims to be writing his story from a safe house in Florida. He has a bunch of things in the book that he is not going to tell his interrogators. And yet, he gives so many clues to where he is, and makes it so clear who he is, and what he's done that this claim is ridiculous.  <br /> <br />I'm suspicious. While much of it sounds right, there is some basic stuff that is just wrong and doesn't make any sense at all.  <br /> <br />So I'm curious if anyone has done some fact checking on this guy's book.  <br /> <br />But, true or not, it's one whale of a good tale.

I'm sitting there in the bookstore, reading, and I'm laughing, and then crying, real tears. I remember buying semisweet chocolate, and gnawing on these big black chunks of slightly bitter chocolate, and how much I want the real thing, but I had to at least have my chunk to gnaw on. This image comes to me as I read this book of myself gnawing, just gnawing like a rodent on this hunk, and I crack up.  <br /> <br />I think about how I love nuts, and how I buy these jars of salted roasted macadamia nuts and then the jar, it's empty, no idea how, you know? They're so delicious! And I started eating a lot of cashews instead, but then I realized they had a huge amount of fat, although it wasn't the worst kind. I got nervous thinking of a friend who loved cashews and fried chicken, a really great guy, pretty active too, and how he died suddenly of a heart attack at 42. Just stood up, fell on the floor, told his wife he loved her and was dead, bang.  <br /> <br />So I have this intense philosophical discussion in my head, because my dad ate great and exercised, did Pritikin all the way, cleaned out his arteries, was really a strong guy. Now he's dying of what? Stomach cancer. So I'm thinking, is it really worth it? I'm going to die anyway, and should I really care? It's a real question.  <br /> <br />That part's why I cried. My dead friends and my dad and all that. I totally relate to what Bill was saying. I'm really a pretty disciplined guy. Head of my own company, and I've exercised pretty good, I like to, it's fun. I can get out there and do all kinds of things. But I'm getting old and it's not as much fun as it was, and I'm starting to gain a bit, and I had a conversation with the doctor just like Bill's. In fact, he called me at work when he got the blood work back, said I had to come right in, my numbers were incredibly high, he sounded frightened. And the fact is, I'm head to head with chocolate and macadamia nuts and cashews now after beating back the things that I can let go of, and they're pretty tough customers. Really they are.  <br /> <br />What is life for? That's what it comes down to isn't it? What's important? I guess what it comes down to is that I have things I want to do.	2004-10-05

This book has one flaw, and hence only 4 stars. But it is a great book that should also be read by anyone who carries their Chomsky around. A really good thing for young college students to read.  <br /> <br />Hey, my mom was a Trotskyite in college. What Horowitz says is totally right on. I don't know that it means that making war on Iraq was the best chess move in this very serious war, but I found only one item that I thought was an error.  <br /> <br />Horowitz states that the war on Iraq and the war on Afghanistan took a few weeks and didn't become a quagmire. However, applying the same logical razor as he used in his book: First, you can't tell if something has become a quagmire until years afterward. Second, there are definite signs of quagmire developing, and it worth noting that the US occupation of Afghanistan never has reached the level of dominance and security at any time that the Soviet Union had there for the early years of their acquisition.  <br /> <br />But, aside from that, he really nails the center of the uneasiness, the political fulcrum which has become a core of the Bush administration. Fact is, the left and its leaders have supported far more terrorism and sold far more lies than anyone else, and that most definitely includes Chomsky, his endless revisionist history and blinkered apologist tracts.  <br /> <br />Horowitz knows his subject like only an apostate can. Seriously, if you want to read a book that will help you understand this political mess we have in America today, read this.  <br /> <br />	2004-10-04

Cute and interesting	As an engineer, I was amused by what puzzles I solved and which I didn't in the early part of the book. Been a long time since I've done puzzles.  <br /> <br />For example, I didn't get the sprinter one, because I knew that sprinters accelerate, then decelerate through their run in unpredictable ways. So the real answer is very unlikely to be 81. In fact, it's almost certain that it isn't 81 under the conditions stated in the puzzle. That's the problem with mixing math and the real world too closely.  <br /> <br />The strongbox puzzle seemed silly, though I knew that it had some trick answer. Because I know Russia and the obvious thing to really do. Just ship the box, locked, call Natasha in St. Petersburg and tell her to cut the lock off. Simple.  <br /> <br />But hey, that's what an engineering career will do to you.  <br /> <br />Nice book. Begorrah, made me want to go back to me Irish roots it did.	2004-09-22

She made you feel these historical people. She has almost everything right.  <br /> <br />The only little details that aren't quite right come where she talks about things that aren't historical. For example:  <br />- Kate Morgan doesn't get jet lag, and some small details about traveling aren't quite right. I fly all over all the time, so I notice that.  <br />- The tranquilizers act too fast. It takes a while for an injected tranquilizer to circulate. The only way to get people down almost instantaneously is if it's injected into the side of the neck into the carotid arteries.  <br />- Kate removes the bullets from the villains gun and he doesn't notice. I've handled guns, and there is a big difference in weight. Better strategy would be to remove the magazine and inject epoxy into the magazine so it won't feed or into the chamber, to block the chamber.  <br />- It isn't possible to track an under-the-skin little chip from a satellite.

I have worked in the former USSR part time for 4 years now, and spent a lot of time there. I have become intimately familiar with what has transpired and the situation. <br />I have read a great deal, Russian history and much scholarly work on USSR and post. Frankly, the latter is almost 100% scholarly dreck, suitable for enriching lawns. <br />Nobody else has captured the essence of what has happened in the aftermath of the breakup of the USSR as well. I could add to it, for instance, the social difficulty of suddenly inverting the Marxist value system is a huge problem. Russia is trying to walk through the looking glass. <br />Other authors should build on Janine's work. Basically, she documents an outrage of foriegn policy and the horrible idiocy of (mostly) well meaning intellectuals and academics. <br />Read this book thoroughly. If you do, it will change your mind. <br />I watch and seethe as the same game continues today. Five star hotels get built which house the &quot;5-Star&quot; aid class of contractors sometimes sincerely trying to help, far too often coldly pretending with utter cynicism, and much too frequently collaborating with local people to rip off millions. <br />What Janine does not discuss, and should be written about by those who build on this seminal work, is the way that the ripoff game works. Billions get stolen, by heads of nations, by contractors who start banks, by so many. The legal system cannot stop it because there is no structure of law that can create a venue for prosecution of people who pull this off in places where it is done in collaboration. <br />Janine doesn't talk about the &quot;warlord game&quot; by which thugs enrich themselves either. I will not name names here, though I could. I could go on, but I won't. <br />Bottom line - read this book. Every American should start to understand how this works. Others should follow this courageous woman. The American people should get mad and get changes made, and most of all, travel- get out there, lend a hand to people out there with business opportunities, and find out what is being done by jerks in our name.	2004-06-27

Others have commented that this story is overlong. It is. But, that's a tolerable flaw in an otherwise excellent story. <br />It reminds me somewhat of Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men and The Starmaker. He has the cadence and language of that era down pat. It really seems like the same author could have written both this and the original, which is remarkable in itself. That era also had a tendency to be a bit longwinded too, but not quite this longwinded. <br />The wind does fill out the sails though, making the characters more dimensional. Pulling in an alternate future morlock though, as a main character, that was brilliant. <br />The ending seems a bit silly though. Here's this guy who has gone past the end of the universe. And after all that, he really wants to go back to this empty-headed Weena? Then he seems to have lost the sense god gave celery, thinking that he can go talk to the morlocks after killing so many of them and setting fire to their forest? I suppose the former is defensible as necessary for the plot. The latter is only explainable by senility.	2004-05-31

There is nothing more dangerous in the world today than this possibility. <br />There are critical holes in this story, which the average reader is quite unlikely to notice. Those holes are intentional and, since only one thing stands between us and this sort of thing - ignorance - Preston deserves kudos for that. <br />Maybe I'll write a book in this genre. Problem is, each time I come up with a plot line, it's too revealing.	2004-05-08

Like the guy says below, it's not a bodice-ripper. It's a military sci-fi story, and it's quite good. It's got his usual clearly monstrous bad-guy critter(s) that nobody would have any problem killing. <br />Like much of Weber's stuff, he has excellent battle scenes, and as long as the scene makes sense as a decision that seems reasonable, it's great. Only thing is, that at critical points it doesn't seem reasonable. The final battle scene - well - given the setup, it would have been handled differently. Wouldn't have been an infantry battle. Would have been 1, maybe 10 nuclear missiles instead. I just can't believe anyone would make that decision, because of the risk. <br />But it's a good story. I'm just a stickler for authenticity of details at all levels.	2004-04-21

I did consulting on arcade games and on one Army pod based VR simulator project. I worked on a book on VR in the early 90's that had a chapter on the horrific dangers we were creating with this technology. The book wasn't published, in large part I think because that market mostly takes gee-whiz-ain't-it-wonderful-technology books. <br />Folks, we have already got a problem, and Col. Grossman has put made it really clear. In 20 years, we will have a level of problem that is beyond imagining today as 3-D videogaming engages in a race to the bottom morally, and a race to perfection in simulation. <br />I am a technophile, a liberal, and all the rest. And folks, those who are arguing that this is about \\"freedom of speech\\" and \\"artistic expression\\" and \\"it's just because of the market\\" are exactly what Col. Grossman says. They are operating lower than pimps and pushers. This stuff is truly evil, no two ways about it. <br />It boggles my mind how people who on the one hand take to the streets against something like \\"School of the Americas\\", and rail against the United Fruit Company's actions that exploited workers in Central America to make a few bucks - THOSE SAME SORTS OF PEOPLE defend utterly the right of some jerk in Hollywood or Marin County to sell to THEIR CHILDREN videogame mass murder trainers to make a buck. <br />We had better do something or we will be seeing children hacking each other's brains out and torturing each other to death, just for fun.

The author is a lesbian woman who is already living her life in the context of how lesbians get it on with each other as they like. So she's trying to give people a way to figure out how to make that life that is already just how she and her lesbian friends live be happier by setting up some sort of rules and ethics. She's talking from her own life. <br />People who aren't into that life already aren't going to get the same results. I don't think male-female bonds are like female-female ones.

The first page was weird, and I was thinking, &quot;Oh, my god. This is going to be totally corny bad.&quot; <br />But it wasn't. It's great. The conversations on science are a little lightweight, but accurate. Just one proposition introduced for the sake of the plot, about extinction events coinciding. <br />As a non-religious guy, I found the arguments in the book really cool and fun. It's a great thing to find fiction that tweaks one's sacred cows. One of mine is the idea that there could not be a god. Sure, this god is way different, but it's a real argument. It's not the &quot;void&quot; of buddhism, nor the tao, nor is it the father-god in heaven. It's a discussion that will rock a guy back on his heels for a change, make him think. <br />Wonderful book, great story in the class of Jonathan Swift!	2004-03-02

There is so much fakery about this disease. There is so much lying about the reality of being a gay man almost anywhere in the world. <br />HIV happens to be fit the profile required to kill highly promiscuous people. That's what's happening, and it will continue. The reviewer from New Zealand that said that someday AIDS will be like the common cold is not a virologist. <br />For your information, the common cold is untreatable. It is innocuous, mostly, for us, only because our immune systems fight it off. <br />A new book that is as hard hitting as Shilts' book would be good. The drug treatment programs are raising the total spread of this disease, because people in the developing world teeming in slums, or out in the bush can't afford to keep taking this stuff, and hardly care, because their lives are so miserable already. They think they are safer, or that treatment is available, and so do people in the developed world. So everyone thinks, more and more that they don't have to change their behavior. <br />Unfortunately, shoveling the drugs that work now to some degree into the developing world is a recipe for breeding resistant strains of HIV, just like shoveling antibiotics there is a recipe for breeding resistant strains of tuberculosis. <br />Why? Because the people can't and won't take them consistently there. Sporadic is worse than nothing at all for the long term epidemiology. All drugs slowly lose effectiveness in the battle against evolution of diseases. But this is a recipe for orders of magnitude decrease of time in which HIV control medications will work. <br />The people can't take them consistently because of logistics in those regions, because of ignorance, because they can't afford them, and most of all because they can make so much money by selling them on the black market to the black market AIDS drug sellers. <br />It's unpleasant, but those cut rate black market AIDS medications that make their way into San Francisco, New York and other cities were taken from distribution programs in the developing world most likely. <br />Sit there in your comfortable house with your pleasant fantasies about how AIDS is being defeated and think about that. I guarantee you HIV isn't under control and won't be. AIDS is gathering itself for a more potent assault than ever. <br />If you want an answer to AIDS, change your behavior and change the behavior of others. Don't count on drugs. Don't ever believe that you can take it casually.	2004-03-02

This prescription and Dr. Osterholm's exposition of threat is far behind the times. I could understand the threat exposition not presenting the leading edge, however, his 8 point program is, today, a Potemkin perimeter. False security is worse than none at all. <br />Those physicians who think Osterholm is out there in the hype zone just don't understand what the march of science and technology is creating. Let us hope that we are so lucky as to only face a smallpox epidemic or, luckier yet, an anthrax attack. We could survive those. <br />Understand, I absolutely do not want to see any such thing occur at any level. I am simply pointing out that in todays world the scenarios Dr. Osterholm has presented are relatively minor and his program is grossly inadequate.	2004-02-16

Even then, they maintain skepticism. It's their profession to do so. What is worse, they tend to have an overweening self confidence and certainty. <br />The activity and conclusions of Meselson in particular, in convincing the DOD and presidents that biological weapons were not being worked on, is a case history that should give leaders pause. Very well meaning, having learned a specific way of arriving at scientific truth by painstaking repeated experiment and results, he was utterly and completely wrong, and incapable of understanding his limitations or lack of fitness for the role that he grabbed for himself in determining policy. <br />I can say that this is the achilles heel of the scientific community of advisers. Scientists are, with rare exceptions, thought followers, not leaders, and unable to project the knowledge they establish forward. If this were not true, scientists would be almost universally wealthy, and excellent inventors and engineers. But who invented the personal computer? Who invented thousands of other things and took them forward? Who understands disruptive technologies, scientists or venture capitalists? <br />The reason I say that this book doesn't go far enough is that even people like Lederer, who also mean very well, and have worked so hard to stop genetic engineering being used for weapons, are UTTERLY out of their MINDS and extremely dangerous to you and I. They have backed us into a corner with biological weapons; a corner which we are quite likely to all die in. I kid you not. <br />Why do I say this? Because it is the sheerest academic hubris to think that high level scientists are required to invent new biological weapons. As a matter of fact, scientists, in general, are the least qualified to invent such things. They have little interest in it, they don't tend to engineering creativity. The computer profession has learned this very well. PhD and MS degrees in computer science are if little value in the real world as a rule. Anyone at all can work on computer viruses, or software to do anything one might like. All they need is tools and manuals. Microsoft was not built by employing PhDs folks. PhD computer scientists have contributed very little to the software profession beyond the invention of the basic electronics and concept. <br />Genetic engineering, as the technology becomes more disseminated and more automated, becomes more and more of a computer exercise. Like the software profession, genetic engineering innovations will follow as this knowledge dissemination explodes outward which the academic crowd will have trouble simply tracking. <br />Since these scientists do not have a lock on this knowledge, and since the technology is not terribly expensive, how could anyone in their right mind think that they could control the development of biological weapons simply by legislating them out of the US military budget? For god's sake, that is farcical! And yet - that is what we have done. <br />That means that had Lederer and others actually thought the matter through, they would have realized that every effort to block the development of biological weapons by nations did NOTHING except raising our vulnerability to biological weapons. <br />All we have done is to stick our head in the sand collectively.  So we have arrived, right now, at a juncture where such weapons can be conceived and produced by anyone who cares to learn the technology. And nobody seems to realize it! <br />We are like a people who, having discovered gunpowder, have decided that we will only allow anyone to even think about using it for firecrackers. Meanwhile, the barbarians are out there, and they are inventing guns. We, congratulating ourselves on what good guys we are, are spending all our energy developing and defending against bows, arrows, spears and swords. It's obvious to a dimwit who is going to win in a biological war if the barbarians do their homework right. <br />You should be far more frightened than you are. Nobody takes this seriously enough.	2004-01-21

This book makes a prescription. It's a pretty simple one. Make sure innovation happens. Hire people to cannibalize the business you are in. Back those people. I will say flatly it is simple-minded. <br />Another strategy is for a company to get in on disruptive technologies by participating in a venture capital pool in their sector. That's an insurance policy, and a win-win all the way around. They can get a look at what is coming at them and so they can make plans for what the future life of their current line is likely to be - invaluable business intelligence. If the competition is really a disrupter, they get the big payoff from their venture capital investment. Heads they win, tails they win. <br />This book has a good description of how things work, but the prescription isn't terribly useful.

Having basically grown up in the context of this movement, studied it, I think I am qualified to talk about it. The movement has and had excesses. It also has a lot of twisting and BS that has nothing at all to do with what the founders did, said or thought. That is most of what Joyce attacks. <br />Fundamentally, the movement was and is about honesty. Honesty about what one is really about and why one does things. Honesty about the reality of relationships. This can be and is abused, no question about it. There are plenty of people who simply use the forms to perform their sadism, manipulations, excuse addictions, what have you. <br />But so is priestly authority abused. So is political authority of almost every kind. So is the demagogic authority of talk show hosts and TV preachers who take advantage of the uneasiness and fears of others for personal gain. <br />People are made this way, and it is part of the parcel of life. <br />This book is full of cheap shots at great people. Everyone has problems in their lives. Einstein was not very nice and liked the ladies. Does that invalidate his physics? <br />No. It doesn't. Poor scholarship, sloppy thinking, and cheap shots are the primary content of this book. It has some points worth making, but they could be made in a few pages.<br />The basic thought that people have a responsibility to society as well as to themselves seems to be the theme here. Or that's the underlying thread I got. Real humanism most definitely is in agreement with that. <br />I have no objections to her attack on idiot pop-psych. But she goes way too far and hurts her argument.	2003-10-22

This isn't a book that educates or speculates about things that could happen (except in highly limited ways) in the physics of this universe. It isn't a book that takes you through to some completion in a story to escape into - it's fun and meaningless but lacking the fun of something completed at the end.  <br />This book has no philosophical depth either, though it nods in that direction.

This sort of book doesn't help. <br />There are lots of footnotes in a book by a guy who can't put his thesis together without contradicting itself. It starts with his hand-wringing about zinc cadmium sulfide, and winds up with his fostering of repugnance. <br />By the end, he is claiming that treaties and verification can deal with the problem. What? At the very beginning, and on the book's dustjacket, it says that $10,000 is enough to set up a clandestine lab according to Kathleen Bailey.  Hello? Anybody heard of the UNABOMer? Ted Kasczynski? <br />Nations, ladies and gentlemen, are NOT the problem here. Individuals and transnational terrorists are. Folks, we are in very deep trouble. We are in so deep it isn't funny at all. <br />That's why this book is so weird. Leonard Cohen seems to be aware that there is absolutely no way to put a lid on this (viz. the $10,000 lab Kathleen Bailey footnote).  And yet he concludes by pushing the idea that we should just put a lid on it?! We should all just make sure nobody even thinks about doing this, and we shall be just fine? But wait! This book is not a bad primer/instruction manual!  <br />It sure seems to me that considering the situation, if we get attacked, we better know how it can happen. We better know what the parameters are and how it all works. Leonard Cohen seems scandalized that we did testing in the USA. Would it have been more moral for us to do it over some other nation? Would it have been defensible for us not to do any such testing at all? I think not, and Mr. Cole does not even wave in the direction of talking about that. Does he honestly think it would be better if we didn't know how these things disperse? <br />Back to the context point - Mr. Cole does not seem to have any idea how many people die each year from taking aspirin, or even flu shots. I doubt he has even thought of comparing these tests to those. <br />All the way through, he makes no effort to set up comparables, nor to assess real risk in the testing that was done. Very low levels of almost anything are innocuous. The National Academy of Sciences clarified the issue with the zinc cadmium sulfide recently. The good professor here, forced a large amount of time, money and energy to be expended on what was known in 1958. <br />It's not a bad book to start with if you are a terrorist I suppose. But if you want to understand what we need to be doing, this book is a paragon of incredibly sloppy thinking, laced with such a plethora of footnotes and scholarship that it takes on the aura of invincible truth.	2003-09-22

It has been many years since my year of living dangerously at 17. I was less into mellowing agents than he, never liked pot or hash which dulled my mind too much. But I loved LSD, peyote and psylocibin. Yes, I did. Had some wonderful experiences from dying and becoming one with the light being-ness to seriously spicing up dinner and Christmas with my family. Quite a thing to see my heavy-duty dad get up from the table, hop and scream for joy at the ceiling from a pure contact high. I never dared to suggest we do it together, but we probably could have. <br />I also had some stellar bad times that seared my soul, never to return to what I was before. I too wonder what I might have been. But I don't regret. No, I don't. <br />Altogether it left me aching for the perfection of the wonder at the peak. The myth of Tantalus speaks fairly well for me. My life since has always been colored by the knowing that I can never slake that thirst, nor can I ever feel I may not drown someday should I try to drink of that spring or that I might not drown if I do not. As Maharaj Ji (Ram Dass' guru) said, LSD can take you to the room with god for a short time, but then you must leave. <br />Reading his book, it is hard to imagine someone intentionally returning to the level of paranoia which he did, and which it seems so many others did also. My lord what dedication! That's one thing that got me. After my first 6 months, things got tres` weird and I didn't like that anxious feeling at all. I kept at it through habit, and because it can be so goddam FUN and profound, then just stopped when I left home on my motorcycle and never did it again. <br />Psychedelics often massively inflate ones sense of self importance in a peculiar way, which Sheldon is honest enough to speak of in his book. Few former heads do. Most simply animate their inflation instead, making those around them subtly or not so subtly uneasy with them, particularlywhen they combine it with addle-pated notions. I have known, since my teens, quite a few who blew out on that course. I won't bore you with those I have known who didn't make it so well, some dead, some flipped, but they are there. I will say though, that far more people went down from unsafe sex, or stupid violence untouched by drugs, or from alcohol than from LSD or pot. <br />I still meet people, 28 years later who want to trip with me. People still know, after all these years. They can sense it if they get close to me. I consider it once in a great while. <br />Most of those I deal with now never have used such things and never will. They are, many of them, stellar people whom I respect greatly. But it is hard to never speak about such things, and I cannot do so with them usually. <br />Good book, and an unusual one in this time. So, thanks to Mr. Norberg for writing it. A surprise, really worth reading.	2003-09-15

That whole Deadhead scene, all the concert thing - wasn't real. Bunch of people going nowhere, amusing themselves to death too literally. Oh, I liked the music, some of it. <br />Thing is, that 15-21 are crucial years for forming character, patterns of action, belief systems and personality for most. Adolescence is hard enough. Taking massive amounts of hallucinogenic drugs during that time is going to have serious effects. <br />Psychedelics can be useful. It's true what Norberg says about them at the end. But they can really weird people into orbit too. That includes some of those who researched them. Check out John Lilly, Mr. &quot;Center of the Cyclone&quot; did he turn into a blastoff boy or what? I've met and known well some of those Grof worked with or taught at some point. They vary a lot. <br />Anyway - I know that kids will always be kids and do stupid things. It's their nature.

As someone who has spent a lot of time in Russia, I found their and the author's blithe acceptance of the murder of the Russian soldier and these muscley kids refusal to lift a goddam finger to help him after he had told them clearly their captors were about to kill him, well, rather repulsive. Their stated denial in the book that he would be fine was so offensive to me. What planet do these kids inhabit? <br />I have traveled extensively in places where I had 24 hour security, including recently into the region on the border with Chechnya, which is massively beautiful country. God help me, but if I were taken captive with such a crew of &quot;Valley Guy/Valley Girl&quot; morons, I swear I would have told them if they didn't fight I'd kill them myself for being such a bunch of twits. I could see in my mind's eye them jumping on me if I tried to attack one of the captors, all with the best of intentions, and my killing them or being killed. Gad. Is this what America is raising? <br />But, hey. I guess that's what they were. The book could be titled: &quot;Clueless left coast twits with big muscles and no sense, on a mission to turn the world into their personal Disneyland, find out reality bites&quot;. <br />Kind of looks like that's what these kids still are. And it is rather clear that the rest of the &quot;developed world&quot; is pretty much the same. Maybe there isn't any other way for them to go.

He comes off as a field ops guy, not an HQ analyst like Herring. Field guys, in certain roles, can be pretty flamboyant since the sort of people they hang out with quite often are. Criminals are often sociopathic and particularly in the drug investigations that Barry used to do, flamboyant doesn't begin to describe some of those guys. They get downright bizzare. <br />Probably Barry's drug-bust type background, and profile as a risk addicted field ops guy is why he's so willing to lay it on the line about what's really going on out there. Comes across a bit like Robert Baer, the CIA guy who has been writing those books on the middle east. It's a classic schism between the guys in the home office and the guys risking their lives out in the field. The guys risking their necks tend to get a &quot;f*** you&quot; attitude pretty fast toward HQ. <br />Book is worth reading, if a bit boring in it's detail at times. Reads like an article series that didn't get published. <br />Some reviewers have said this book is a slander suit waiting to happen. Naah. First of all, it's printed, so it's libel. Second, I'll bet good money that Barry could trot out enough evidence in court to convince a jury he was telling the truth. So nobody is going to sue. Guys like Herring and the management of SCIP know better. Barry would cut them to ribbons, and then counter sue and set himself up for life. <br />Besides, it's much more effective in the long run to freeze the guy out of his profession, quietly. Or just ignore it completely, because it doesn't matter.	2003-09-11

It also provides a solution that the bad guy(s) execute. <br />But, in the midst of defeating the bad guy, who is such an obviously grotesque comic-book villian, the book forgets to actually make any argumenta at all against either the thesis or the solution provided. Nor does it suggest any alternatives. <br />If it had, it would have been 5 stars. But it doesn't, which leaves this reader thinking - Why not do it that way? Better than thermonuclear war, don't you think? Better than mass casualties from sophisticated biological war, no? Or do the authors prefer those two options with corpses rotting in the streets? Better than drowning our cities from global warming, eh? We are facing massive casualties whichever way you cut it, may as well be as nice as possible. So what IS wrong with the Kali Option? <br />Fact is, fellow earth-dwellers, we really are faced with exactly such a crisis. We are watching the world hit the wall right now, and we will see a massive denouement that will make the plot of \\"Saturn's Race\\" look sweet. So how can the authors argue against such a merciful course without bloodshed, in order to blunder on into a future where far worse horrors beyond imagining loom? What sort of peacock drivel-tripe philosophy is that? <br />This insipid generation taking control of the world just now should have started to grasp how incredibly quickly the world can spiral into war. All it takes is a few thousand people killed in the right provocation, and kaboom - it's on. This is especially true when the generations have no experience of what real war is like, only blap from TV announced by the likes of Geraldo. <br />The world is a tinder-box sitting next to a powderkeg, just waiting for the right spark to really blow sky-high. The primary drivers are want, overpopulation, greed, religion and insipid naivete. We will have this crash,and well over a billion are almost certain to die of it. A billion these days scarcely scratches the surface. A billion people, as described in the book, just creates about 20 years of elbow room is all. Hardly worth sneezing for in planetary terms. Big deal. All replaced in a few years. <br />A book like this that begs the question of what is wrong with the \\"Kali Option\\" turns itself into one more insipid little entertainment while flirting with asking real, hard questions. <br />But the questions remain, and the solutions are all ugly as sin. That's the reality of the world we live in when you put down this book.	2003-09-05

Petit and team members endured readings as cold as minus 70 Fahrenheit, though the station holds the world record low of minus 129. They stopped drilling about 120 yards short of a subterranean lake the size of Lake Ontario that's been trapped for perhaps millions of years beneath the ice sheet. ... The lengthy Vostok ice core is particularly significant because previous cores taken from Antarctica and Greenland dated back only about 150,000 years and showed just two ice age cycles. The new core reveals four ice ages at roughly 100,000-year intervals, shedding new light on how the icy interludes end.\\"<br />If the ice sheet ranges between 150,000 and 400,000 years old, depending on location in Antarctica, then Hancock's theory of an Antarctic habitable continent and civilization some 15,000 years ago cannot be true. Period. Those figures would indicate that the crustal slippage theory also doesn't happen. <br />Hancock also leaves out something that seems so obvious I cannot imagine how he missed it. There is archeology and geology regarding the filling of the Mediterranean and Black seas. These would have been quite large enough for his civilization, and these conform with the current theory of temperature flips due to screwing up the Atlantic currents that currently keep Europe warm. <br />In addition, the climate flips that create ice ages are, based on current theory which is founded in geological records, very rapid indeed - on the order of a year. Superstorms are quite possible under such circumstances, along with huge floods and snowstorms until the new heat distribution pattern (AKA the weather) stabilizes. Such things would be quite difficult enough, even without having the \\"sky fall.\\" <br />However! There is a great deal that Mr. Hancock has put together that is quite intriguing. One wonders if it is possible that ice ages do self-limit by encouraging volcanism, for instance. One wonders if there might, just maybe, be a regular enough occurrence of asteroids hitting the earth as to cause tidal waves? If a sizeable one hit an ocean, that could be quite an event. As well, since we have mostly ocean, it would be the most likely place, eh? <br />It is a very interesting book, which I thoroughly enjoyed. But I doubt very much that the central thesis is true. I expect that Hancock has, however, hit on some things that are quite worth looking into aside from his central thesis. <br />Taken as a wonderful piece of amateur investigation, it's great. Makes one think, and ponder, which is the most one can ask.	2003-09-03
US	45675105	R31QPNMCWWWGYG	0765342286	230034308	Jumper: A Novel	Books	4	1	3	N	N	A very good book, with incredibly realistic content	I have to say that this Gould guy knows his stuff about what goes on in the world. I read the objections below to the attempted rape scene, but the problem is that this is a common thing for runaway boys as well as girls. The kind of father Davy has is common enough too, and the kid's decision to run away was not untypical under the circumstances. Reading it made me think that either Gould had \\"been there, done that\\" or else he had really done his homework. I suspect he was there to some degree at least, because his knowledge of 12 step sounds like what only a veteran would write, and the street reality is so vivid. There's real depth there. <br />For Pete's sake people, runaway kids end up being auctioned off in bars and nightclubs, while stuffed with drugs, and worse than this. That's the real world - out of the frying pan into the fire. The attempted rape scene in this book is lightweight. Really, it is. For runaways it goes way downhill from there. Think about that next time you see some of these kids on the street, or soliciting men in Mercedes' for sex. They get really screwed up from it all, believe me. I recommend the book \\"Predators: Pedophiles, Rapists, and Other Sex Offenders: Who They Are, How They Operate, and How We Can Protect Ourselves and Our Children\\".  (Which is not to say that predators only target runaways by any means.) When kids go runaway, they are lucky to find a place of safety. Yes, I know they do sometimes. But they also end up as hamburger in the sex industry machine. Often enough, they wind up dead.<br />The book is very well written, a revenge fantasy. At the same time it is instructional to kids in terms of making them start to really think about what they would have to do in order to survive if they ran away. <br />You see, I wanted to run away when I was 16. I hated my life at home, I was desperate. Lucky for me, (I think) a religious group counselor, who was not a predator (and yes Virginia, predators become youth group leades as part of their MO with frequency) talked me out of it. Who knows. Maybe, just maybe, I might have done well. But odds are against it. Things are tough enough as it is. I more or less ran away at 18, a so-called adult. At least I could work. But trying to get a job, with no money, after my only pair of jeans had the right leg cut off by a hospital because I had an accident - not fun at all. <br />I know two other former runaways. One, a woman who ran away to New York when she was 15, now has a large scar on her arm from where some junkies saved her life from a heroin overdose. They injected her arm with a large amount salt to cause pain and save her life. The other was a man who fought back against his father's beatings finally, ran out the door at 14, and was taken in as a novice by a Christian monastery a thousand miles away. He was lucky. She was lucky too, and came home after 3 months. I think the overdose woke her up enough to send her home, and she was lucky enough not to go all the way down, dying young as a junkie-prostitute. Luck, for both, provided a safe place to survive - for the girl it was her home after she returned. <br />That's how I read this book. A teenage coming-of-age fantasy story, that proposes an outrageous premise as a game, then uses it to explore the gritty, viciously nasty reality of what it really would require. It also goes inside the head of a teen wanting to run away pretty well, and if, by any chance, a teen would still want to run away after reading, (which I doubt very much) they would be forearmed a little bit. <br />For those teens who are thinking about running away, maybe you have to do it. Maybe. But you had better understand that mostly surviving as a runaway is a matter of luck. Really. Better to go to a school counselor, or child protection services first if you can. Because, fact is, you can't teleport out of trouble, and it is likely to come looking for you. <br />You know that, right?	2003-08-25

Made me want to go build a min-sub from cast-off parts and go exploring. <br />I'm a nitpicky engineering sort. Found it unlikely a guy would be too functional after swimming up and cracking his head on a concrete roof that was covered with barnacles. I'm a damn good swimmer, and have a bit of experience things like that, but softly, and not with the kind of bang he'd have done. That bit of the story indicated a lack of experience. He'd have had a very serious headache, with lacerations to the bone, if he was conscious at all, and be putting a lot of blood in the water unless he had a good set of dreadlocks to cushion things. The part about them swimming so far at night underneath a floating city was also pretty hard to believe. Fish would school under it, and that would bring sharks and barracudas which would be everywhere. Big benthic fellas. <br />A real fun story story though, with a lot of good details.	2003-07-25

But this book gave me that feeling I get when I am grasping hard for the principle when studying some new physics - but it didn't satisfy because it couldn't, since there is no such physics in reality. It has one bit of fairly straightforward geometry, Schild's ladder, used as a metaphor for making one's way through life, which was a sort of interesting bit of philosophical metaphor. <br />This concept about having implanted quantum computers in our brains that take over our identities, and using bodies as throw-aways reminded me of &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;. But the author just sort of jumps over it into a brave new world. He doesn't deal with an obvious implicit horribleness to the idea. For this future to take place, at some point these quantum computing implants would have to take over the bodies they were implanted in. The servants becoming the masters in other words. Clearly, by the time the story opens, the biological beings that we are had become the throw-away clothing of this pseudo life technology with little more value than a slave under King Ludwig of Belgium. What, may I ask is so damn wonderful about that?!! It's &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; except the body snatchers won millenia ago, and humanity is absolutely nothing. <br />How could an author fail to deal with such an obvious and central matter to this kind of technology idea? Altered Carbon did no better. Is this really what anyone thinks they want? <br />As someone who has worked with &quot;AI&quot; so-called, neural nets, etcetera, and is very familiar with its theory and limitations, it's an indication to me of an author who doesn't really understand this stuff, just uses light reading as a jumping off point. Sure, quantum computing - clearly the author has read some layman's stuff. I guess that my suspension of disbelief needs more to go on. <br />In addition, too much, &quot;there be a miracle&quot; in this book. From the quantum computer implants, to &quot;scribing&quot; a new multi-dimensional string graph in the quantum vacuum, to the &quot;scribing&quot; of new graphs on the boundary of a new universe in the midst of our own - it's too easy, too pat, and complete baloney without a trace of foundation anywhere. <br />Egan has quite an imagination though, have to give him that. There are some interesting social prognostications based on the implantable quantum computer technology, and the vendeks have their moments. But maybe this author should be using his wonderful imagination to write novels more like the Xanth series, that don't pretend to base themselves on anything but magic. Takes itself a little too seriously also.	2003-07-25

Dark and dark - however without anything redeeming I could find. Dick's dark novels had a point. They had something to say. What does this book have to say? It's just dark for the sake of darkness and action. A big \\"So what?\\" by the time the end came. Yeah, yeah, enhanced bodies, ridiculous fight scenes, cliff hangers, blah, blah. <br />But lordy, the darkest thing in the book is the technology at the center that creates \\"immortality\\"! It's utterly dark, and it's a throwaway gee-whiz thing in this book. Excuse me? A magic supercomputer recording device that takes over one's body and brain is like, totally wow, dude? A living death at the command of some artifact computer thingy in your head is just cool/hip/wowza story foundation, and let's ignore it as a given?<br />The deepest this book gets is to envision scenarios for people splitting into more than one. That's original, but without getting into whether the \\"person\\" is a person at all? Hewwo? Earth to author. You have something BIG there. Hewwo? Maybe you could, like, explore the BIG thing? <br />So why give the book 3 stars? Because it's very well written and his first book. The technology, aside from the magic that makes this miniature thingamajig possible hangs together. If the author can develop some depth as well as humanity in his soul he could be great. As it stands, the book has all the depth and thoughtfulness of a TV action drama.	2003-07-25

It also paints a picture that absolutely fits the profile of the kind of personality that is excited by killing and considers women to be objects, or animals that have no rights. The link with Man Ray <br />My guess is that there is something crucial left out of this story, that Steve does not know. Probably, the crucial link is that somebody in the LAPD of the time was involved in the parties that George Hodel held, or was implicated. <br />Quite a courageous thing to do, although one could, of course, speculate on the Oedipal significance of finding out something like this. <br />All in all a very good book.	2003-07-19

Maybe because it wasn't taking itself too seriously. A really fun book. Taking the physics innovation as a given, he hung that together pretty good. Made one wonder what would happen at phase 3 though, which was an obvious extension they didn't talk about. (I won't spoil it, but you can think about that as you read it.)<br />Only things I caught that just didn't work that the author missed: <BR>Somehow, with a snapped weld on their comms antenna, they don't go EVA to fix it for a couple days of flight? Then anal-retentive-boy post alky captain does a flipover? But the go EVA later, no problem. Daft I call that. <br />And then that cell phone ringing out at 4 light seconds from earth? Sure, you could pump up a signal and reach the phone, make it bark, use it as an annunciator, but talk back to the caller on that phone? That's outrageously silly. There wasn't any delay on the cell phone, but there was on the regular comms? Snort.<br />I really don't think the big earthmover tires would disintegrate on Mars overnight if frozen. Wouldn't faze'em one bit at Valles Marineris temperatures. Those long chain hydrocarbons with cross links don't break down from freezing. I guess our man John ain't a chemist. Nor has he spent time in North Alaska in winter or he'd know you can drive a wheel when the tire's frozen solid. It's damned uncomfortable, what with the flat spot goin' whack, whack, but tire'll do OK. Sure, it's not in the manufacturer's spec, but just about anything you do with a tire is out of warranty anyway. Tires are tough things. Just ask any landfill manager. <br />Those were the only floozer things. I'm a stickler for things fitting together. But those were peripheral and unless you're a rip-snorter like me, you wouldn't notice them. <br />So OK. I've spoiled the story slightly for you. Except it's a really fun story, and I loved it.

That part was like Anne McCaffrey's \\"The Ship that Sang\\" gone horribly wrong. But it was pretty clear from the beginning that these creche children were crazy as loons. I just couldn't see that happening. <br />There were a few science things here and there, but it was mostly an excellent story, with an interesting alien. <br />A few tweaky things, like a colony filled with cloned chemists who couldn't get any base stock for food production out of an oil refinery. The refinery wasn't explained either, nor the source of the oil on this nearly lifeless icebound planet. <br />There was an odd bit about the colonists needing to hold back on terraforming, raising the planet's temperature.

There is something I can't quite put my finger on about character development that he needs to do better at - but I liked the characters. I liked them better than those cartoonishly larger than life critters that populate too many books.<br />I have a note on safety - DON'T go \\"urban spelunking,\\" as described in the bookd. Or if you do, bring oxygen with you and an oxygen monitor. Why? Because people die down there from lack of oxygen. I know this because I was trained to do it many years ago. Heavy gases build up, and you don't know it. By the time you are anoxic, you're too far gone to get out - i.e. a goner. H2S, for example, saturates the nose at very low concentrations, so a whiff smells the same as near total replacement of atmosphere. There is a reason why manhole crews have ventilator-blowers up top, and generally, there is supposed to be a guy up top ready to pull you out at any time. Be careful! Surges happen, and what was safe 5 minutes ago can turn deadly. <br />About the story - At first I thought, \\"Oh, this crew is ridiculous!\\" But after it was explained how the mission was finished with private money, it was plausible, so OK on that. The plot had a number of things happen that were highly unlikely though, like going to check out an old return vehicle without very careful and meticulous, step by step procedures. The initial setup disaster was pretty hard to believe. However, I've seen some amazing stuff go on behind the scenes. They would have had more help though, from the earth, to figure out how to get through their problem and to do the checkout. <br />Shrugging off death? The last reviewer seemed to imply that when someone gets killed people would collapse or something like that. I know from personal experience, that isn't what happens. At least it wouldn't with a crew who could get to Mars. That part was highly accurate. You keep moving and bury the dead. Mourning comes out later, over years. <br />It wasn't very likely that a commander on a death march across Mars would spend days looking for someone who was lost though. He'd know exactly what the life of the suit was, and stop looking when it was over. Anything else would be dereliction of duty to the crew. That seemed quite odd to me. <br />It was quite a traverse story. He made it believeable I thought.	2003-06-25

Those guys said that inside the ship was nothing at all like the movie. <br />This story. Well, if that's how it really was, ...but that's hard to believe. Sort of a cross between \\"Gremlins\\" and night of the vampires fallen from outer space. Hard to fathom how an extraterrestrial could be adapted to our biology enough to use our blood for meals. And the energy dynamics of growing a living organism are highly endothermic - it takes quite a bit of energy. How could all those replicants have been grown like that? Seriously, the total blood volume of the few people identified wouldn't come close. The creatures seemed to just live on blood. Sure, you had 22 people listed as missing, but even then, that might give enough energy for maybe one critter. Although, who knows - maybe it's a designed critter. But even then, thermodynamics needs to add up somehow. <br />Seems implausible by the end. It doesn't answer how the creatures were killed. The hero watched the underground detonation of the a-bomb from a mile away, and is inside a tunnel that is connected to the complex that got blown? Hmmm. Well, perhaps possible if the blast sealed the tunnel shut, sinced it was circular. But if the hero lived, and the creatures were in the tunnel ahead of them all the way, as described, then the little vampire critter-kidssurvived too; they were tough little buggers for sure...	2003-03-04

But I would argue that there were poets of Stalinism, and architects and poets of the Third Reich - that does not excuse them from their support of an evil ideology. <br />I am still in process. I have not finished the Koran, and as one who was raised to tolerance and humanist ideas, I feel I must explore this. But my readings of Koran and Hadith have shown me a Mohammed who was an evil little debauched creep. A creep who managed to make his way into history, by means of murder, lies and genocidal warfare, allocating booty to his followers, enslaving as he went. This is his lasting legacy. I'm sorry to say that in examining the base literature of Islam, and the \\"theology\\" it is simply awful. The ideas, the values, are hideous. The stories of the life of Mohammed make me ill. <br />Robert Spencer's book has helped me to understand how Islam got so many adherents. He helped make it clear that almost nobody would have become Muslim, except because of fear for their life. Children, raised from babies will believe any sort of rot. And a system which systematically kills apostates cannot move. <br />I travel a great deal. I am not some stay-at-home American who sits in front of the tube watching CNN. Mr. Spencer has pushed me a bit more, and the direction he pushed me in is that of a sense of extreme danger from these people. <br />I remember a lecture I got from an Iranian years before 9-11, who told me, \\"You do not understand. These people are incredibly dangerous, these Muslims. I know. You do not. They want you dead. They really do.\\" I didn't believe him then, not really. But as time goes on, I see that the closer I get to this culture and people, the more clear it is. And that is true of most I meet, including those who live in the context of Sharia, still oppressed by it.	2003-02-24
US	45675105	R363BUFE01MGRQ	0226493644	411166366	More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun-Control Laws	Books	4	45	58	N	N	A very good study that made a difference	John Lott has written a very thoughtful and logical book which should be read very widely. (I only rated it 4 stars, because it is so repetitive. But I guess it has to be.)<br />Some years ago, I was fairly in favor of gun control measures. It all made sense to me, since obviously if people don't have guns, the can't shoot others with them. Over a period of years, some things happened, and in the spring of 2001, I believed my life to be threatened, which I reported to the FBI. (Yes, this was quite real.) That experience taught me how almost completely useless such agencies are in protecting us against even very specific threats. Seriously folks, you are on your own. I found out then that all politicians can get and most have permits for concealed carry firearms, even politicians like Dianne Feinstein who have campaigned against them. All of that made me start thinking. <br />I happened across John Lott's book during a business trip that got extended because of the 9-11 aircraft grounding, and found it a fascinating read. I have a fair background in statistics using it a lot in my work, I am quite able to see fallacies, and invalid use of statistical analysis. I could not find any fault with what Mr. Lott has written. <br />I have thought about this quite a bit. And I realize now that my thinking on gun control was really quite fuzzy-headed and emotional, rather like one of the recent reviews of his book from the Australian. (I don't believe, by the way, that certain reviewers, such as the Australian, have read this book beyond the title.) For example, in Australia, there are other factors, population density, as well as relatively flattened economic pyramid which correlate to crime rate. And as Australia and England have both found, along with American cities that have tried it, other crimes rise with severe gun control measures, and brawn becomes more important. ... And criminals pick on weak targets. <br />I am posting anonymously, because I don't want to get involved in some flame war with people who haven't even read up to understand what they are talking about. This is a very emotional issue. If you want to understand gun control, this is a must read.	2002-10-24

Few people know the origin of such companies as Onieda Silver or the Amana corp as stemming from religious communal societies of long ago. <br />What this book has to offer those interested in bottom up economic development is hundreds of years of results of experiments both successful and unsuccessful.	2002-08-19
US	45675105	RPW6APJHMRGO	0743435257	901207868	Gust Front	Books	3	7	10	N	N	A page turner, but with some very strange deficiencies	I found this book hard to stop reading. But as I read along, I found that more things cropped up. As a military novel it falls seriously short in the realism department. The author has clearly studied ordnance. But after killing 10,000 heavily armed aliens, how on earth could nobody have the idea of stealing their weaponry, which is clearly superior for close range engagement? How on earth could nobody have the idea to steal the floating platforms that the god-kings ride? At the very least, those could be used as giant floating mines since the blow up so nicely. But the armament on board - any soldier worth his boots would grab it. This is all so obvious, but nobody explains it. <br />Then there is the question of nuclear weapons. While it is understandable why missiles would not be used, in such an invasion scenario nukes would be used, from the ground, disassembled from their rockets. <br />The incompetence of the alien invaders is also kind of hard to explain, as is the weirdness of multiple intelligent species in a federation that have star travel (and its attendant high energies) but no ability to wage war, as well as no modern manufacturing ability. Not well enough explained, that. <br />The other incompetence of the alien invaders is that they don't bombard the earth with rocks first. This is another obvious strategy. Maybe one could guess that they assume they want to preserve everything phsyical. But that's not clear. <br />But what was really weird is the economics of the invaders. That isn't thought out very well at all. How could a few square miles of arable land and a chemical plant or two make these god-kings rich? That wouldn't come close to paying for the transport of his ship and its warriors. The numbers don't add up.	2002-04-16
US	45675105	R16666RR4W789H	0262681218	84630596	The Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier	Books	2	34	44	N	N	Not very honest	The virtual community is, in reality, at best a bunch of people disagreeing and regularly indulging in shark-like small group attacks. The WELL, of which Howard speaks so much, hounded one of its early members - Blair - to his death by suicide, a matter described, but not really examined with much thoroughness. Yes, he touches on flaming, but does not examine a deeper pattern of common harrasment, particularly of outliers. How Howard himself participated in this type of online gang harassment activity, not understanding the man, Blair, and discounting his claims out of hand is a quite interesting story. He touches on this, and gives an account, which would be acceptable in a personal autobiography. But to leave it where he does in a book purporting to be a seminal piece on virtual community is truly remarkably remiss. Since the record is all there, or was, it could have been given serious consideration.<br />The conflicting interests, and the commonly irresponsible behavior of people online - viciousness, gratuitous, undeserved nastiness, intellectual dishonesty - looking for targets to vent on is not explored as it should be. This is quite common outside of the world of flaming. <br />This book is a gloss piece, advertising for something that doesn't really exist as he claims. Howard, while a pleasant guy personally, does not show himself a deep thinker, and may not be much of an observer either. Nor is the author ready, willing or able to take on anything that is likely to upset the herd of which he has become something of a starring member. The story of virtual community is not such a very nice one in many ways. <br />The underside of the story of virtual community is a story of psychological denial, denial about a great deal. It is a story of in-groups and out-groups, and a good deal more, something which requires an anhtropologists eye, and someone with more nerve. <br />Go ahead and read this book. But understand that the book itself is evidence of the degreeof denial which pervades the \\"virtual community\\".	2002-01-22
