Yet he writes that marketing is simply effective evangelism.  He shows that some basic techniques of marketing are essential to being a growing church in a postmodern context.<br /><br />He sets his effort within the context of a swimsuit salesman named Bob who moves to Barrow, Alaska with his new wife.  Through Bob's efforts to sell swimsuits in the Arctic he shows basic principles necessary to market the church effectively today.<br /><br />A short 30-45 minute read that's fun.  Would be a useful study group tool for church councils and evangelism teams	2005-10-07

He begins with an interesting premise; Crazy Horse and Custer are the two most recognizable figures of the Indian Wars.  How did their lives lead to this intersection of men and historical event. This creates an interesting , if artificial framework for the events leading to Custer's Last Stand.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting thing to me was how both Custer and Crazy Horse were products of their cultures and were unable to understand the culture of the other.  Custer in particular was doomed by the inability of the Army to understand the reality of life on the plains with the Indians and their insistence in placing incompetents in charge, and their refusal to listen to anyone who told them different opinions than what they wanted to hear.  Perhaps just as jarring was their indifference to getting it right.  Sound familiar anyone?<br /><br />An enjoyable read	2005-09-18

He does an excellent job of letting the events drive the narrative, while capturing the reader with the picture of the characters.  As I read I could see the transformation of both John and Samuel Adams-in many ways reversing roles.  In fact it was nice to see the heroes of the revolution treated as people on a journey to become revolutinaries.  Finally, I think his greatest contribution to m y understanding was helping me see that neither side really understood the other and seeing the arrogance of empire (perhaps a lesson some of our current politicians could learn)<br /><br />Excellent	2005-08-17

Quick summary.  The USS Indianapolis delivers the ABomb dropped on Hiroshima to it's assembly point then heads for the Philippines.  On a nasty night, the ship is torpedoed.  The survivors fight salt water, the sun and sharks.  If that wasn't enough, then they have to fight the navy.<br /><br />Two things struck me as I read the book.  First is the ass covering mentality of the Navy even 60 years after the fact.  This is one of the great travesty's of justice in American history.  Perhaps more importantly, the attitude of the survivors inspired me. Even after being shafted by their own government, they didn't develop the  cynical attitudes we boomers (and our progeny) have developed in the post Vietnam/Watergate era.  They simply sucked it up and carried on.<br /><br />I was inspired reading this book.  These guys define heroism	2005-07-08

Religious Calling, the Priesthood, and My Father	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Required reading for any Board of Ministry	Minna Proctor deals with two emigmas in this book; her father, who prior to his divorce from her mother showed little interest in faith and had little to do with developing any sense of a faith journey in her, and the process of ordination which is often a mystery even to those involved directly in it.<br /><br />This book benefits from an outsiders perspective and her willingness to try to uncover the assumptions that underly the process.  In doing this she not only provides a description of the process of discerning the call to ministry, but a sense of history in how we have come to the point of understanding calling in this way.  While I am a United Methodist, not an Episcopalian, I found much of the book to be true to my experience of dealing with the Board of Ministry.<br /><br />Particularly the issue of clairty of call is a place ripe for discussion.  While not all callings are alike, the ability to articulate that call is important.  The sense of call is the reason a normal intelligent person would submit to such an examination (in some cases a 5-8 year process) and then upon it's completion take on the task of ministry.<br /><br />In my opinion this book should be required reading for folks who deal with candidates for ministry. We need to be reminded that we hold the lives of not only the candidates, but all who love them in our hands.	2005-04-14

I'd see it on the shelf and go blechh!!!, having never read a word he wrote.  Finally in desperation for something to read, I picked this up.<br /><br />Later that night after a reading binge, I put the book down, finshed in one sitting. Ever since I've been haunted by one sentance. \\"There's nothing we can do to make God love us more, and there's nothing we can do to make God love us less.  In that one sentence, Yancey hits the paradox of grace.<br /><br />As people of faith we are caught between the demands of law and the gift of grace.  As one reads scripture, it almost seems as if the biblical writers still had not resolved the balance for themselves.  Yancey tries to negotiate the balance between the Jesus who offers himself in unconditional relationship with us and the same Jesus who says I didn't come to eliminate one line of the law. Yancey does this largely through stories that make grace seem really accessible and really costly.<br /><br />If you were to buy one book for someone who wanted to know what it meant to be a Christian in the 21st century, grab this one and give it to them.  I've already gone through 5 copies.	2004-12-16

He attacks the myth of the charismatic leader and particularly is brutal on those who lacked clarity in the name of diversification.<br /><br />As a minister, I have found the book to be helpful as I attempt to lead my church to being more mission focused. By emphasizing effectiveness over charisma, Collins helps me be more comfortable within my own skin and identify those leadership skills that are most important, such as nurturing leaders and refusing to accept anything less than great.  Moreover, the emphasis on putting a great team together to create a vision with their passion and skill seems to open the door to a much more collaborative process.  I keep returning to the importance of the image of getting the right persons on the bus and the wrong persons off.<br /><br />I highly recomend this book	2004-12-16

Maybe I feel like a idiot because Ramsey showed me that financially I am and have been an idiot.  Ramsey's emphasis on debt elimination instead of debt management is a challenge to the very system we have bought into and if widely accepted would blow a hole in the banking industry's profits.<br /><br />Perhaps the most valuable tool in the book is the concept of the debt snowball.  Most of us want to attack our big debts, but Ramsey suggests putting those in a holding pattern and paying smaller debts.  As each of these pay off, attack the next debt on the list until paid.  The funny thing is it makes so much sense, you first wonder why you didn't think of it and secondly how could you be so stupid.<br /><br />This book might be the best wedding present a parent could give their child.	2004-12-16

This is more than the use technology and contemporary stuff approach, moving on to an organic embodiment of the kingdom.  Slaughter says that the answers of Ginghamsburg are not necessarily your (or my) answers as that may not be authentic for our situation.  He says to do this we have to unlearn church as we know it.<br /><br />He mixes his insights with stories of churches that he considers to be effectively unlearning church and a series of questions at the end of each chapter to encourage the reader to actively unlearn what he/she \\"knows\\" to be true<br /><br />My only problem with the book is that I've heard it in so many venues that it did not seem new, but that is more my issue than Slaughter's	2004-12-16

Imagine several bright, articulate folks who weren't arguing over the historicity of the Gensis accounts, but simply looking for their meaning.  Moreover, all weren't Biblical scholars.  Their ranks included novelists and playwrights who understand the narrative elements far better than I. As I watched I developed favorites who I looked forward to hearing from again and others who drove me batty.<br /><br />When I bought the book, I found it to be incredibly helpful for me as a preacher to identify the questions that might be asked of the Genesis text that I would fail to ask because of my own biases or my own fear of asking a sacreligious question.  The book is especially good in it's examination of the image of God and the wrestling Jacob stories, but perhaps my favorite is the discussion of call and promise, particularly because of strength of the scholars-Robert Alter, Burt Visotzky and my favorite, Lew Smedes.<br /><br />This book can help us answer the questions people are really asking, instead of the ones we want them to ask.

Fortunately, these thoughts are so engrossing the reader is thankful.  In this book Bruggemann indicates that for the church to be faithful in the modern world it must engage in obedient interpretation within the  context of our world.  Borrowing from the story of the Assyrians  seige of Jerusalem during the reign of Hezekiah, he suggests we engage in a conversation at the wall with our community, and a conversation behind the wall with people who understand the language and purpose of faith and speak it into our context.  The interface of these two conversations is the basis for evangelism.<br />Often I disagree with Bruggemann when he draws unassailable political conclusions from the text.  However, he makes me question my own biases, because his argument is so engaging.  I agreed strongly with him in his analysis of the current state of pastoral care (not informed enough by faith therefore not very pastoral) and his prescription (moving from Rogerian detatchment to engagement).	2000-12-30

She is either unaware of how her biases play into the hermaneutic circle or doesn't care. She seems to assume that if one is seeking to follow God her argument is unassailable.  This is not true.<br />Admittedly my resistance in part is due to my own reading of history, politics and scripture and my biases are many.  However, I felt she failed to attempt to engage those who operate from a different place.  Her most interesting work was in refence to the Sabbath, and our need for the same.	2000-12-30

Weems shows that leadership in the Wesleyan spirit is not rote aplication of Wesleys writings and work to conemporary situations.  He posits a hermeneutic move whereby we apply the broad general principles of the Wesleyan movement in the context of contemporary society.  Generally useful to students of both leadership and Wesley studies.  Highly reccomend	2000-11-18
