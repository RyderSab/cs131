Shapiro makes some really poor points in his book. In a section of TV he calls Fox's programing one of the worst. What he doesnt mention is Fox is owned by Rupert Murdoch (there goes liberals corrupting). He also things that sexual classes shouldnt be in college (last time I checked there are also religious studies classes in college)<br /><br />He also calls Brent Bozell a media critic. That's like calling Michael Moore a political commentator.<br /><br />This books leaves an interesting question, \\"what did Shapiro watch as a child?\\" MTV is bad to him, even Nickelodeon. If Shapiro had his way it'd be  700 Club 24/7.	2005-10-03

The problem with enemy within is that Savage generalizes a lot. He thinks everyone in Marin Co. is liberal, like when he complains about the college student in line in the restaurant. This generalization is coming from a conservative living in the Bay Area. He also generalizes liberals as judges, even though he doesnt know their ideology. <br />Savage does has a bibliography in this book - so it is more respected than Savage Nation.<br />The book is slanted, but Savage voices his opinion.	2004-07-13

Instead of talking about Al Qaeda he goes after France, Germany, Belgium, Canada, and England. To Gibson anti-American is confused with Anti-Bush.

The best part is that he doesnt sit around protecting the democrats, but criticizes them as well as Bush. The funniest part is 'A day in the Life of President Bush.

I didnt like his tearing apart of Coulter and other conservatives. That is something that is childish and done by conservatives like Hannity and Savage.  He also labels Howard Stern as a conservative???????	2003-03-24

You need to read it with an open mind though or you wont get anything from it. It shows the double standard that has always been in American government. Supporting one evil dictator while denouncing another. It also shows that the answer to why 9/11 happened is much more complex then 'they hate us for iur freedoms'.	2003-02-27

The big drawback was the lack of comma which made it hard to read. I would find myself re-reading a sentence to understand it. I also really did not like the ending to the book. I guess in my mind I wanted it to go another way.	2003-02-18

I;m not surprised by them since they would be there if a liberal wrote a book but they should be pointed out. First of all Sean goes off on Clintons cheating without mentioning the number of Republicans that had extramarital affairs. He calls Clinton a scumbag for pergery while he hails Poindexter a hero who also pergered himself before congress. He mentions Linda Cahvez and Pete Wilson and their views on immigration without mentioning their own use of illegal immigrants for work. He says that liberals are wrong to say they're pro-choice, shouldnt conservatives be wrong to say they're pro life when they support the death penalty? Finally he mentions how Fox News is balanced and fair, this is coming from the same station whose reporter (Riveira) lied about his reporting in Afghanistan. It wouold be nice to find a real balanced book and one that is slanted to one political side.	2003-01-03
