Its hero, Detective Kinderman, the only grating part of the otherwise lean and wonderful Exorcist, is front and center here. And, wow, is he a bore. Muttering, and \\"philosophizing\\" for pages and pages, forcing the reader to endure his supposedly charming, digressive approach to crimesolving, befrore something--anything!--happens to actually advance the plot.<br /><br />Blatty clearly thinks Kinderman is a genius creation; you begin to suspect that Blatty created this character as a self-portrait, and lets him drone on purely out of narcissism.<br /><br />If you find this book, as I did, in some dusty thrift store, leave it there.	2005-09-14

Albo nails this character: The one-upping, passive-aggressive, self-esteem-eroding \\"friend,\\" that we all recognize (even, disturbingly, in ourselves.)<br /><br />The comic monologues from Albo's stage shows that have been adapted into this quasi-novel are funnier when he performs them--on stage, he gives the Underminer a motor-mouthed, shallow pathos that evens the score somewhat between him and his \\"loser\\" victim. This doesn't entirely come across in print, but the writing still rings hilariously true. This book doubles as a pretty good social/cultural history of the '90s.<br /><br />I had a couple problems with it, however:<br /><br />1) It's fairly static: The characters (the loquacious Underminer and his silent victim, a failure whom we only see through the Underminer's biased p-o-v) don't really evolve. They become more or less successful, briefly adapt trendy philosophies, but the Underminer doesn't seem to acquire wisdom, or undermine more deftly/softly/menacingly as time goes by.<br /><br />2) After a while, the obnoxious Underminer is just not all that fun to be around. Although I kinda love that the book ends so very bleakly, the character has worn out his welcome by then.<br /><br />Also, the interstitial illustrations and product parodies are a lovely idea, but they occasionally veer into a surreal humor that's at odds with the observational satire of the rest of the book.<br /><br />But well worth reading...and if you get a chance to see Albo perform, seize it.	2005-04-10

Rowling ingeniously uses Uxbridge to parody a passive-aggressive petty bureaucrat, and recast that familiar persona as pure evil. Uxbridge's asinine trademark phrase, \\"hem, hem,\\" becomes increasingly chilling as the book unfolds.<br /><br />This book is less frustratingly episodic that most Potter books ...with a true plot line and sustained conflict, it propels the reader toward what should be a great climax.<br /><br />Should be, but isn't.<br /><br />The problem with Phoenix is that it largely exists to set up the inevitable, full-on, truly climactic battle between Voldemart and Harry that we'll finally get (it would seem) in Book 7, the last in the series. Phoenix teases you, but ultimately ends flatly.<br /><br />That said, the book is still exciting...partly because the reader can start to see the character's *potential* to contribute to the Book 7 final battle. It's rather moving to realize how potent a force Hermione, for instance, is going to be, as her grasp of magic becomes increasingly virtuosic, her sense of loyalty grows fiercer, and  she casts-off her worrywart egghead persona and openly defies authority.<br /><br />Klutzy Neville is also emerging as a strangely noble, even powerful (?) character.<br /><br />Even though I was ultimately somewhat disappointed with this book, I'd definitely recommend it.	2005-04-10

It's considerably better than \\"Boy in the Water\\" (which rehashes many aspects of Church, his most acclaimed book it seems). I tend to agree with the reviewers here who praise his writing, instead of those who find it \\"slow.\\"<br /><br />Yes, he piles on detail after detail, observation after observation--typically, in short, simple sentences. But I found the cumulative effect oddly hypnotic. Bonus: Rarely does the writing become florid or self-conscious, or rely on the cliches of the hackneyed mystery/thriller genre.<br /><br />That said, this book disappointed me for a couple reasons:<br /><br />The first person narration becomes really strained at times; the narrator relates events he didn't witness and conversations he didn't overhear so precisely and comprehensively that you get distracted by the implausibility. Are we supposed to believe that this narrator exhaustively interviewed the characters after the fact (though some of them would have been dead by then) to reconstruct these scenes?<br /><br />The book's point-of-view is really \\"first person omniscient,\\" a more surreal literary tactic that's a bit at odds with the mystery/thriller genre, but Dobyns occasionally tries to justify the approach as \\"real.\\" (The narrator will throw in a brief explanation for his super-knowledge--\\"as Barry later told me,\\" for example.) I'm not sure you can have it both ways.<br /><br />The bigger problem is the ending. It's not particularly surprising in \\"thriller\\" terms, nor does it resonate with the book's themes in a satisfying, more \\"literary\\"  way. It's just bad and deflates the book's momentum.<br /><br />I'd have trouble recommending this book.	2005-03-06

You have only to look at the scary photo of him modelling his \\"black and white chic\\" look on pg. 109 to realize you're *not* in good hands. To anyone who knows anything about fashion, this garish mix of baroque patterns reeks of fashion victim. Judging from the rest of the items \\"from Carson's closet\\" featured on this spread and others like it, he breaks at least three of his own \\"fashion commandments,\\" namely:<br /><br />* \\"Disregard trends\\" (check out his crystal-embellished t-shirt, or his skull motifs, both trends that are already passe)<br /><br />* \\"Keep it simple, sassy!\\" (patterned suspenders?)<br /><br />* \\"Don't overdo it\\" (aforementioned garish mix which he models with a slightly frightened \\"I'm cool, aren't I?\\" Botox-frozen expression)<br /><br />You can tell the book's publishers had to really beg to get him to wear a relatively restrained suit for the cover photo. But even then, he gives it his special touch with an enormous pocket poof and embroidered loafers, not to overdo it or anything. And it should be pointed out that this suit's jacket is strangely long, while the pants are strangely short.<br /><br />If you like cookbooks written by people who can't cook, Carson's your man.	2004-12-12

Actually, all the stock Follet ingredients are there: feisty independant woman stuck in some crucible, love triangle, life-or-death pursuit. But I have to disagree with a number of reviewers here: the characters are *not* well-developed, consistent, or believable.<br /><br />As a character, JANE makes zero sense. She's sketched out as an intelligent, resourceful woman with a clear sense of ethics who loathes betrayal...yet after an unforgivable betrayal, she seems to get over it and forgive the traitor in, oh, about 10 minutes. JEAN-PIERRE, her villainous husband, actually thinks such \\"dastardly\\" thoughts as \\"Now I'll get you--and you'll be mine forever!\\" This is villainry on the cartoonish level of Austin Powers' Dr. Evil (especially when compared to the complex hero/villain of Eye of the Needle.)<br /><br />Please don't buy or read this book. If you want to try Follett, sample the two books mentioned above, or The Pillars of the Earth, an expansive, ambitious novel that can't really be pigeonholed as a thriller.	2004-12-02

Highly relatable.<br /><br />This sequel, on the other hand, feels forced. Most of the parents, teachers, and fellow adjust way too quickly to the news the guys are gay. And the obstacle/crisis pattern of the plot feels mechanical.<br /><br />The weakest moment is definitely the opening chapter, in which a teacher supervising a Gay-Straight Alliance meeting asks the three guys to write an essay about being gay and Sanchez forces these three \\"essays\\" to provide all the backstory that went on in the first book.<br /><br />So, in laughable language that's supposed to be teen colloquial, Nelson recounts the events of the last novel, over-explaining, referring to his best friends by their full names. The whole thing feels v. forced, like nothing Nelson would ever write.<br /><br />Lots of good things about the book, but--since I'd had such a great time reading the first--it bummed me out.<br /><br />You will have fun trying to determine if the \\"Jason\\" on this second cover is the same model as the \\"Jason\\" on the first book.I i still can't decide!	2004-09-16

Had there been such a book when I was a teenager back in the 70s/80s, maybe I'd have had an easier time being gay. (And I know I would have read it to shreds.)<br /><br />Sanchez really conjures the unbearable tension of hanging out with another guy who might or might not be gay. The \\"holding hands\\" scene at the movie was suspenseful, refreshing, SEXY. For me, it cut through all the cynicism about sex that older gay men perpetuate, and restored my sense of how brutally nervewracking but *exhilirating* those very first moves were.<br /><br />My complaint about the book is its obvious educational agenda. Sanchez seems compelled to shove pamphlet-y info into the plot. How to set up a GSA in your school, How *not* to have sex.<br /><br />The book gets very alarmist about HIV, and while I'm not suggesting that unsafe sex is anything to be taken lightly, everyone in the book reacts with Greek-Tragedy-level hysteria that seems really polemical and forced, and compromises the bittersweet \\"reality\\" of the rest of the book.	2004-09-12

Or his so-called more ambitious work, such as the ridiculous, bloated novel, IT, which, even at 1000 pages, never convinced me that evil in the form of a clown (!) dwelled in a sewer system.<br /><br /> Cujo, on the other hand, is tight, solid, suspense fiction, typical of his early work. I still think The Shining is King's best and most deeply unsettling book (the *All Work And No Play* revelation still creeps me out to the point where I have to double-check my locks).<br /><br /> But like other early novels such as Carrie and The Dead Zone, Cujo showcases SK when he was still testing his talent, trying to push it. Here, his challenge was clearly: Can I break out of the supernatural niche and still write a damn good book? And he does, though he succumbs to the temptation to hedge his bets with a (never resolved or fully explored) hint at the occult.<br /><br /> In short. Read it. Instead of IT.	2004-07-25

Though admittedly not Atwood's finest work, &quot;Lady Oracle,&quot; her first major bestseller and a book with obvious autobiographical significance, gets 3/4 of a page. Even Surfacing, a strenuously profound novel and surely worthy of eggheady analysis, gets short shrift.<br />This imbalance undermines the book's value, and while The Red Shoes is a must for any serious Atwood fan, prepare to be frustrated.	2004-01-10

It's also a little disorienting, because as other reviewers here have pointed out, what begins a single point-of-of view book gradually opens up to include several points of view. What you discover by the end, of course, is that the author has pulled off an interesting feat: She has subtly and successfully shifted the reader's symptathies from Mary, the putative heroine to Mrs. Jones, the seamstress. The additional points of view are not sloppiness, as some here suggest, but a way to let the reader slowly gain a more objective understanding of Mary Saunders.<br />By the end, she's like a former friend who has gone irretrievably bad, a friend to whom you must say goodbye, albeit bittersweetly, for your own self-preservation.	2003-11-22

I recently re-read it and realized why: the key theme is the acceptance by the conventional of the \\"Unusual.\\" The narrow-minded vs. the open-minded. The extremely narrow-minded parents balk at the \\"unusual\\" color of the pink motel, and declare that they will paint it \\"gray or brown or white\\" as soon as possible. The children, more open-minded, love the color of the motel and actively seek out the unusual. Of course, by the end, even the parents have loosened up under the spell of the Pink Motel, and somewhat nervously accept the Unusual.<br />It's clear to me that one reason children embrace this story is that it reassures them that there might be a place for them in the world, no matter how unusual they are: i.e. adopted, too bright, extremely isolated, gay, or the \\"wrong color\\" (depending on where they're going to school).<br />Beyond that, it's just a terrific story, swiftly told, with great illustrations.

It starts to fall apart completely when the Daughters of Eve--a bunch of girls who heretofore have done nothing more radical than sell raffle tickets and volunteer at old folks' homes--decide to attack and molest a male chauvinist pig. Even if we believe they would commit such violence under the leadership of a *teacher* (which would surely just be too weird to go unquestioned), Duncan fails completely to think through what the psychological aftermath of that event would be (surely a little more complex than self-congratulatory glee). The girls seem untroubled and progress to even more violent crimes.<br />The other really problematic aspect of this book is its villain's take on feminism, which is so obviously unbalanced and extremist. It's impossible to believe that these girls would accept it so unthinkingly.<br />In short, the book is implausible, overcooked, and kind of a mess. Ironically, Duncan's supernatural novels feel more convincingly \\"realistic.\\" Skip this, and turn to those instead, starting with Summer of Fear, which rocks, and Stranger With my Face.	2003-04-02

It's full of trashy sex scenes and lazy language. Puzo himself dissed the book, and freely admitted that he wrote a ... formulaic book strictly designed to make money. Francis Ford Coppola's movie axed out all the pulpy aspects, and transformed a cheesy best-seller into a powerful piece of art. A key example of how the movie script blows the novel away:<br />In the book's opening chapters, the narrator states that Don Corleone has always intended to make Michael his successor. Oops...<br />...there goes the suspense! Puzo ruins the crucial character arc--Michael's slow conversion from \\"nice college boy\\" to \\"ruthless don-in-training\\"--with this one line. In the film, on the other hand, no one views Michael as a successor. It's understood that he shuns the family business. As he's drawn in, it's his resistance, his denials, and his ultimate capitulation that keep us watching.<br />Book botches this; film handles it expertly. Just one of many examples. By all means, read the book, but maintain a little perspective. It's no masterpiece.	2003-03-04

Revelation: how much stronger and sure-stepped it seems to me the second time. Atwood's expert handling of the slow power shift between Elaine and Cordelia affected me more deeply this time, perhaps because I've lived longer now and have seen strong friends falter and others, once dismissed as &quot;quiet,&quot; emerge as the real, fierce talents.<br />Don't hesitate. Read it.	2001-12-03

I think it's kind of sad that this author has fallen prey to the trap of writing SERIES books like the Alice series. This is one of her older books, and although it has a few sequels, it is one-of-a-kind and does not have that &quot;first of a series&quot; production-line quality that has ruined children's literature. Highly original, truly scary, richly evocative...a wonderful justaposition of creepy magic and mundane suburbia. A modern classic of sorts.	2001-11-28
