Understanding of Saint Anne and Saint Croix, the twin planets on which the three novellas of the \\"Fifth Head\\" takes place, requires us to take an analytical approach: perhaps as a psychologist or anthropologist (there is one mad psychologist and two anthropologists to show us the way). After re-reading the first novella, I think that the real enthusiasm of Wolfe was to show how limited the characters' understanding of their world is; and the surprises that come up are subtly foreshadowed in the first story. This is following in the footsteps of the good (and often great) Jack Vance. <br /> <br />Wolfe goes beyond what Vance has done (at least in the Vance books that I've read) in using allusions and indirect points of view to enrich the story. By allusions I refer to the tie-in to the Book of Revelations in the first part and the resemblence to Conrad in the last part. Indirect points of view are used in all three novellas: childhood memories drive the first (and the most enjoyable) novella, the middle novella is a recitation of a (fraudulently) indiginous inhabitant of Saint Anne to an anthropologist, and the last novella is a mixture of writings of the same (?) anthropologist in a scrambled time-order. <br /> <br />Wolfe presents Vail's hypothesis and lets us decide whether or not it's true - the shifting identities throughout the book create what appears to be a complex puzzle to which the answer might be buried in the details. In this way, Wolfe shows just how difficult contemporary science is: in order to find something new and useful about nature, one has to rely on the validity of a mountain of past observations and reasonings. Often,there's no real certainty about the most fundamental things that the sciences are built upon.  <br /> <br />Some of the reviews of thisbook centered on messages Wolfe may  have been sending about colonies and the treatment of indiginous populations. I'm thinking that anthropology and psychology (two sciences going under radical changes around the time of first publication, 1972) were not devices, but the purpose of \\"Fifth Head.\\" <br /> <br />One does not have to be scientist, obviously, to appreciate the complexities of the book, but it helps to understand how equivocal some of the fundamental questions were being addressed in the \\"human\\" sciences at the time. How should we raise our children? Where did we come from? Who came to North America first? These days, genetics are revolutionizing and (apperently) clearing away a lot of the fog surrounding these basic questions: something like Vail's hypothesis would get answered very quickly by a gene chip. It's much more difficult now to imprison somebody with purely circumstantial evidence with the availability of DNA testing. I give my highest recommendation to read Wolfe's novel, as well as re-reading of the first part. \\"Fifth Head\\" may serve as a classic reminder of the natural world, as was understood, before the genome revolution.	2005-05-27

There's some negative feedback on this site about the book being more a collection of articles, which is a legitimate complaint. At least they would be well-written articles. <br /> <br />Besides the easy and clear writing style, the main strengths of \\"Freakonomics\\" appears to be that much (if not all) of Levitt's observations come from research that is in peer-reviewed publications, and that the featured academic personalities (Levitt, Fryer and Venkatesh) are contemporary and working today. Thus, the primary sources of most of the material, as well as contemporary critics are around to defend or refute the discussion in this book. <br /> <br />The nice thing about many economists today is that they utilize the internet to spout off on many topics that would at first glance seem outside their field. The authors of this book, Cowen, Kling, Tabarrok and others have regularly-updated blogs. Levitt is therefore certainly not unique in applying economic \\"tools\\" to a variety of contexts, but he takes advantage of the internet himself to defend this book. <br /> <br />An obvious flaw of \\"Freakonomics\\" is how it heaps praise on one of the authors between the chapters. This ridiculous pap should have been left behind in the NY Times Magazine. Ignoring that, there's two other things that are seriously bothersome: <br /> <br />1.) The accusation of regular discrimination on \\"The Weakest Link,\\" a game show. Yes, there is a paper referenced, but some presentation of data would have been useful in the book. I wonder why the details were omitted in this case and presented in all the other subsections of this chapter. My primary reaction to this statement was strong skepticism. Apparently, one needs a subscription to \\"The Journal of Law & Economics\\" to know the sample sizes involved. More details would have been nice to see, because Levitt/Dubner go on to point the discrimination finger at other groups, using collected data to show people's actions betraying their declared intentions. What patterns do the data need to show in order to signal discrimination? In the case of \\"The Weakest Link,\\" most readers will never get to find out. <br /> <br />2.) Exclusion of Thomas Sowell. I recognize that this is a popular science book, and not a scientific book that's popular, but the elephant in the room is clearly the complete absence of the work of Thomas Sowell. Not only is Sowell a contemporary economist who has researched and published extensively on race, culture and incentives, but for many people he has already accomplished what \\"Freakonomics\\" attempts to do: introduce people to economics by viewing current social problems in the context of incentives. Sowell's \\"Basic Economics\\" and \\"Advanced Economics\\" are both clear and non-quanitative books that exploit economic thinking in a way superior to \\"Freakonomics.\\" I also recommend his \\"Affirmative Action Around the World\\" and \\"Cultures\\" series. <br /> <br />\\"Freakonomics\\" is a nice little read, and most people who pick it up and read it will likely enjoy it.

I'm surprised the archetype of the smooth-speaking, values-toting Texas lawman hasn't been used more often in today's (make that yesterday's) American political climate - possibly because it conflicted with the daddy's-boy bumpkin caricature that was used in 2000. Perhaps Thompson needed to be alive to correct this mistake. <br /> <br />Politics aside (Thompson's Communist membership would have put him at odds with a lot of Texas lawmen, I imagine), this happens to be a great little crime novel. The startling absence of internal struggle is probably the keystone of the book; his self-assurance seems to keep people in the dark for quite some time, even though his pattern of crime is reckless. I read this story a while ago and was reminded of it when news of the BTK killer of Wichita broke, with stunned churchgoers and family members confessing their ignorance on national television. <br />   <br />This book is the best Jim Thompson novel that I've come across, and is highly recommended.	2005-03-08

I also often read papers (usually in the medical science journals) that demonstrate variable levels of statistical understanding. After reading many book chapters, MATLAB materials and web pages, I found this book to be the clearest and easiest introduction to ANOVA techniques. I've been recommending it to many people that depend on self-learning to substantiate their competence in data analysis. <br /> <br />Whenever I need to re-learn the fundamentals and assumptions of a particular technique, I find it useful to spend a half-hour or so with my favorite textbook on that subject. This handbook has become that textbook: there's nothing wrong with being easy to read. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that for $27, you don't get an in-depth introduction to ANCOVA, which is a very common related technique. Too bad, but it does not prevent me from giving this small book my highest recommendation. Of course, there are many $90+ books out there that lack either clarity about ANOVA or discussion of ANCOVA or both.	2005-03-03

That DVD will make one appreciate the postive and negative aspects of this story by Thompson, albeit indirectly. The \\"grift,\\" or the daily habit Roy and his mother have of snatching easy money through dishonest means, is a stand-in for Thompson's own experiences with alcoholism. Roy can't peel himself away from the grift, despite the isolation it causes him and his condemnation of his mother's behavior. Roy's stomach problems and stay in the hospital were derived from Thompson's ulcer problems. Thus, there are strong autobiographical elements in this story, which in my opinion take over the book and crowd out the Moira and Carol characters. Westlake was wise to pare down the Carol subplot, even if it took away from Roy's heartlessness (I found Roy a little more sympathetic in the movie than the book) -- and perhaps some of Thompson's guilty recollections. <br /> <br />What makes this novel so interesting is that it's the rivalry between the two women, Moira and Lilly, that drives the plot, despite the fact that they only meet twice (three times in the movie). Westlake understood this and distributed the scenes among all three of the main characters. <br /> <br />I could see how someone could pick up this as their first Jim Thompson book and conclude that he was overrated; my recommendation is to also watch the DVD and read the real masterpiece \\"The Killer Inside Me.\\"	2005-02-12

The writing is less sophisticated than Morris' New York Post entries, and by far the weakest parts are those dedicated to combining the chapters into a common theme. That includes the insipid title and awful book cover. <br />  <br />Few of the writers that criticize either Bush or Clinton have the insider's perspective like Dick Morris. As noted before, the best bits come from anecdotes inside the Clinton White House (Clinton's unwillingness to confront Sandy Berger, veto-but-not-a-veto of the Dodd bill, and to top it all, Jimmy Carter's absurd takeover of the talks with North Korea). Morris gives us the impression that Clinton had his strengths, but his scandals and lapses in moral conviction caught to him and handicapped his authority.  <br /> <br />To Morris' credit, the only direct comparison made between Bush (43) and Clinton is the willingness of Bush to confront the enemies of America. Other comparisons, I'm sure will be the topic of future books. <br /> <br />Dick Morris' book on the crimes of the 1990's seems a little dated and reads like it was written for less than sophisticated readers (like Goldberg's \\"Bias\\"). Hence, the three stars. I still recommend it for those curious about how the events (and non-events) of the Nineties led to the world of 2005 (not to mention 2001).	2005-01-31
US	49157966	R6GFHKLQB6J6F	0060930349	796423640	A History of the American People	Books	5	18	23	N	N	a mammoth effort: post-1960 stuff is good, too	Paul Johnson's book makes all of American history entertaining and interesting for the general, if open-minded, reader. There are two prominent Amazon reviewer comments that I disagree with: <br /> <br />1. The Suggestion that we should ignore the post-1960 material <br />I agree that after 1960, Johnson's description of events appears to be largely sympathetic to Nixon and an aggressive attack on Kennedy. This is not necessarily due to a change in Johnson's analysis as it is the familiarity of the readers with the subject. We have to stop expecting American history to be something not to be questioned. Johnson had every right (and obligation) to argue against affirmative action, for example, as much as he had the right to refute the popular understanding of the riots in New York during the Civil War. \\"Objectivity\\" is an impossible standard in history; instead Johnson gives us his conclusions and judgements with the reasons he has for making those judgements. <br /> <br />2. The \\"anecdotal history\\" comment <br />This history is anything but a collection of anecdotes. Johnson includes many stories to give us an understanding of the personalities of historical figures, but this book is packed with facts and numbers, fully referenced. \\"Anecdotal\\" history would be what most Americans had to sit through in high school. Not so with Johnson's book. <br /> <br />I don't give this book 5 Stars for being perfect. It is not perfect. Many episodes of American history are lightly covered and in my opinion under-represented. That is why one should find other books (e.g. Max Boot's book on small wars, Eric Schlosser's book on fast food) that do an excellent job filling our understanding of how America in its present form came to be. But I believe Johnson's book to be the best of its kind, by quite a margin.	2005-01-25

So much happens in this short book (as turns of plot, but also development of character) that it compares favorably to the first half Camus' \\"The Stranger.\\" The drifter plumbs the depths of his desperation in a brutal attachment to another man's wife: it's not greed or lust that drives him, but a base need for someone to whom he can anchor himself. A raw and amazing experience, unmatched by anything else of Cain's. <br /> <br />McCoy's \\"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\\" is impressively vivid. I had no idea these dance-hall marathons took place before reading this story. This circus of exploitation of young and apparently desperate people certainly makes for excellent Noir. One of these benefits of reading these novels is the unearthing of buried episodes in America's past. <br /> <br />\\"Thieves Like Us\\" has been reviewed here as the weaker end of the collection, and I have to agree. It's still a very capable story of outlaws; and the stoicism of the young people caught up in the criminal's lives is admirably depicted here. I recommend reading Andersen's novel before the others (it's still definitive Noir), so one can more easily avoid expectations built up by the Cain and McCoy. <br /> <br />\\"The Big Clock\\" is interesting in the depiction of power relationships between employer and employee, and the shifting first-person style of telling the story works here. I never heard of Fearing before reading this novel, but he evidently had a deep understanding of the motivations of very different kinds of people. This novel has the most suspense of the collection, and is a great and sophisticated read. <br /> <br />The most surprising and bizzare novel is \\"Nightmare Alley,\\" a strange and memorable journey of an aspiring carnival charlatan. It defines Sleaze. The longest and most complex novel, it feels like a long-lost classic that's been hidden away because of its disturbing content. Some may think of it as too long, but the twisting journey through sweaty farming towns, railroad stations and addled big-city martiarchs required time to establish some crediblity: by the end, I was convinced that such a grotesque collection of stunts actually belonged in the story of this country. \\"Nightmare Alley\\" alone is worth the price of the book. Fans of Tarot might be a little offended, but this is especially recommended for understanding fans of Ray Bradbury. <br /> <br />Finally, \\"I Married a Dead Man\\" by Woolrich is a suspense novel set up by a tragic accident. The protagonist, literally and figuratively hungry, siezes the opportunity to substitute herself into a more fortunate woman's life. Excellently done, and more grounded in comparison to \\"Nightmare Alley.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, there's no legitimately weak entry in this collection. The variety of content in these novels is enormous, and acquiring this book will allow the reader to experience the different flavors of American Noir. Most modern crime/suspense movies will seem ridiculous by comparison.	2005-01-22

One author, who is rich and famous, pays the other to kill his estranged wife: the payment is in the form of a fraudulent ghost-writing deal. Perhaps Westlake is very familiar with the plight of authors who write good books but suffer under market forces; he does not seem to work very hard to get us to sympathize. \\"The Hook\\" will probably \\"work\\" as a psychological novel as much as the reader admires the lifestyle of fiction writers in Manhattan. I certainly don't, so that's likely part of the problem. <br /> <br />Plausibility is also de-emphasized here. How do these writers turn so easily into opportunitistic criminals - is there really some descent into insanity? Better writer-turned-madman (also astronaut-turned-madman) stories have been written by the gloomier and funnier Barry Malzberg. In fact, \\"The Ax\\" and \\"The Hook\\" make Westlake a kind of Malzberg-Lite in my mind, which is good because Westlake has a lot of books for sale.  <br /> <br />Despite my criticisms here, \\"The Hook\\" was still an entertaining and rapid read.	2005-01-22

Instead of adapting his skills or changing careers, he decides to kill off the competition. His targets are not the executives or consultants that directly cost him his job, but people who were axed, just like him. <br /> <br />The humor in \\"The Ax\\" is dark, indeed - he knocks off one guy who is tending his lawn (thus trying in vain to keep up appearances in his suburban environment) - the protagonist has to identify himself with his victims in order for the plan to work.  <br /> <br />Another reviewer made some statement about \\"how the number of good jobs continues to decline in the United States,\\" which is baloney (and has been baloney since this novel has been published). If you don't have to define what a \\"good\\" job is, then of course you can claim that there's more or fewer \\"Good\\" jobs than before. Because the world changes over time, someone who wants to continue doing the same thing for a living year after year after year is going to have substantial difficulty, regardless of the economic conditions. The protagonist of \\"The Ax\\" doesn't want the job as much as he wants the excuse to start killing people slightly more qualified than he is. <br />  <br />I'm not a big fan of mysteries, or in this case, murder-novels, because murder as an economic choice would seem to me to be a rare and inplausible act. I don't identify or sympathize with this character. However, Westlake is clearly having fun with the story, and the reader will have fun also.	2005-01-20

Not only was it a warning about the contents of the food (though this is what made the headlines in our generally insipid mass media), but an exploration into the business models, labor conditions and history of this giant industry. Schlosser did a fine job researching the different aspects of fast food production, represented the entrepreneurs in the business admirably, and made this American story into a stroy about America. I bought a copy or two of this book as gifts to other people a few years ago, and it therefore gets my 5-star rating.<br /><br />Since \\"Fast Food Nation,\\" McDonald's has changed as business. It's restaurants have become cleaner and quality salads are now offered on the menu (nothing fancy, I know, but more worthwhile than the salads at, say, Applebee's). It is no longer the rock-bottom worst option for eating in America (it probably never was). I haven't eaten a burger at McDonald's since reading this book, so I can't speak to any changes there.<br /><br />Hardee's has also reportedly improved since the merger with Carl Jr.'s, and has recently gained some notoriety with the \\"Monster Thickburger\\" promotion. \\"Fast Food Nation\\" also featured the history of Carl Jr.'s, so this crass move to occupy the space left (partially) by McDonald's is not a huge surprise. The rapid expansion of Krispy Kreme, fueled by unusual transactions between store owners and the corporation, serves as an excellent example of the relationship between franchises and boardroom, as described by Schlosser (though the matter is still under investigation).<br /><br />Will Mr. Schlosser ever match this effort in the future? That's hard to assess, but this book will always provide an antidote to the corporate crony-ness of large media outlets. As long as fast food companies pay the broadcast bills, the ugly but fascinating details of the business will remain hidden until found by independent journalists.in hidden until found by independent journalists.	2005-01-17

The marijuana and strawberry articles are definitely superior to the last third, which deals with the outlaw-to-industry history of porn. It's good writing overall, just not really worth buying in book form. This experience was analogous to my interest in the periodical \\"Mother Jones;\\" initial fascination due to some good research, followed by a gradual decay of interest due to predictably one-sided reporting. Hopefully, Schlosser will come back with his next book to prove himself more than the average liberal journalist (there's enough of those).

What a difference it made: Peter Lynch's life story, free admission of his mistakes, explanation of successes and overall optimism pushed me toward investing. This was at a time when banks were advertising 1% or 2% interest rates for their savings accounts on the radio. Is a 2% rate of return ever something to brag about? <br /> <br />For anyone who lives in a free country and feels it necessary to have substantially more money in the future than at present, Lynch's short book serves as a excellent introduction to the market - enough information to decide whether investing is a practical undertaking or a giant loser's game.  <br /> <br />My favorite chapter is the one which lists some of Lynch's missed opportunities, where equities that he considered but did not buy went up astronomically, to his dispair. Dealing with these missed chances is a vital emotional task for the beginning investor, who may be tempted to stray from investing in what he or she knows and start gambling. Most investment books that I've looked at do not approach this problem, which is understandable because presumably it goes away with experience (credible investment book authors are generally experienced). <br /> <br />This guide is easy to read, easy to find and is contrary to the spiel given by most mutual fund managers on TV (who would rather you pay them to pick stocks for you). There's really no excuse for the prospective investor (or even financial self-planner) not to read it.	2005-01-15

When this book first came out, the argument was over whether there was pervasive bias in major media outlets, and in particular, CBS. Now, the only discussion would seem to be not how much bias there is at major news outlets, but what alternative news sources exist that would better serve the inquistive public. The answer seems to be talk radio and the Internet. So, though Goldberg's book is to be taken seriously, the way people find the news (and the way news conglomerates try to make profits) is changing so dramatically that \\"Bias\\" is getting rather dated. <br /> <br />I was going to give this book three stars, or not review it on Amazon at all, for its overly personal view and simplistic discussion. Easy reading is fine and benefits many poople, but the sticker price of the book should come down accordingly. I thought that media bias would be covered more comprehensively and more professionally in some other book (which I probably wouldn't read). CBS News, 60 Minutes, and much of the rest of main stream media seem like artifacts of 20th century, a more naive time when truth wasn't as important to a lot of the working population. Hopefully Mr. Goldberg will sieze the day, with the help of better writers, to help unearth the culture of bias while there are enough people that still care. Rosebud.	2005-01-13

There's some complaints on this website about the cheap puns and large amount of asides, but I found these to be relatively minor defects. What Paulos does so well and so often is relate contemporary ideas in mathematics in a simple and understandable fashion. The stock market, of course, is the ultimate foil of quantitative predictive techniques; but Paulos' WorldCom mistake is due to psychological deficits - not trusting the wrong algorithm.     The most interesting point in the story of Paulos' misadventure with WorldCom stock is his deceiving his wife about his financial activity. A useful rule of mine in personal investing is Don't Lie to Your Wife. Obeying this rule - if he had a rule like this - would have certainly cut his losses to a moderate level. There's a pretty good chapter in this book about how immoral manipulation of equity prices probably doesn't pay off as reliably as one would imagine. The missing chapter is how moral and honest behavior can indeed benefit in the long run (as the O'Neill book states, cutting one's losses short is as important as picking and riding the winning stocks).     Paulos does the mature thing and accepts personal responsibility for his WorldCom mistakes. This is in variance with Jim Cramer's $20 pamplet \\"You Got Screwed!\\" and the many shareholder class action lawsuits.     I would recommend this book to any investor today, especially as a companion (one may say antidote) to Lynch's rightfully optimistic \\"One Up On Wall Street.\\"	2005-01-12

La Terre is a very good book, and Zola's declared favorite, but the very brutishness of the acts perpetrated by the characters (other Amazon reviews have summarized them) tend to overwhelm the lighter moments. In fact, the simple humor (dunghill marriage proposals, drunken barnyard animals and the lifestyle of the character named Jesus Christ) is the main current of the story, and suggests that there's not a whole lot that can be done to change the ways of provincial farmers. Like Germinal, the protagonist Jean (a member of the family tree that connects all 20 novels in Zola's series) quickly becomes the character needed to move along the plot - while the other, more colorful beings form Zola's themes.  <br /> <br />Like another of the Zola Penguin editions, I found the translation very readable and the translator's introduction useful, but the back cover summary misleading. Though many of the activities featured in the book are seasonal (wine-making, the harvest, etc.), the story of greed, squabbling and murder is a one-way street. \\"Unremitting hardship\\" is experienced by the farmers, but much of it is their own doing - they reap in continual poverty what they sowed in short-run greed and mental laziness. Zola would really not have us feel sorry for these characters, where even the most pitiful - Hilarion, for example, carry out grevious crimes. <br /> <br />There's a hostility to innovation, change, religion and outsiders that keeps the people of Beauce at a hardscrabble existence. Change would seem to come anyway, in the form of imports from America (fertile soil and the Homestead act brought about the most rapid liberalization of land ownership in history during this time). I can't help but be reminded of the election year Outsourcing panic that was used in Wisconsin campaign advertisements. Wasn't it just a few years ago thata lot of us were stuck in the Dilbert Zone? If we couldn't take the monotony of cubicle life and abhorred all the infighting and micromanagement, why are we so terrified of India? Would this not be the catalyst for change that we requested back in the 1990's? If there's a contemporary lesson from La Terre, it might be located in Part 5, Chapter 4, where a liqoured-up Lequeu finally vents his feelings to the locals, who cheer the upcoming Franco-Prussian War. <br />	2004-12-27

Max Boot's book received my attention when I read his article relating Bush's 2004 election victory to that enjoyed by McKinley in 1900, during the Philippine insurrection. Like the Iraq war, the Philippine war was not decided at that time, with a guerilla enemy frustrating pacification efforts and a homeland media largely locked in a struggle to unseat the administration. I'm not going to comment on the embarassing performance by mass media here, but it is notable to see that Bush and McKinley, two Republicans, were able to keep their seats while Truman and Johnson did not. The Philippine insurrection, along with a multitude of other small wars, are covered in Boot's work in some detail. I do not know of another book that does anything similar. <br /> <br />The main theme of the book is that in America's history, war in some form is the rule and not the exception. The Powell doctrine represents all of the wrong lessons from Vietnam, a small war fought disasterously like a conventional war, and small wars have been largely the domain of the executive branch of the government. Overall, the book is a rather fascinating perspective of American military history and makes for very decent reading. It makes a good companion to more general histories, such as Paul Johnson's work. <br /> <br />I could site two (for me) shortcomings here: it would be nice to  have seen more coverage of British small wars and Soviet small wars. American successes and failures could then have, say, the Afganistan invasion, Chechnya and the Falkland Islands engagements to guage against. Also, Boot leaves out the Korean War from the discussion and gives little space to the Balkan involvement of the 1990's. I realize that the Korean War was not  a small war as defined here, but this study seems to provide a good place to put it in some perspective. The breakup of Yugoslavia, having occured after major media's apparent decision to cut down on international news coverage (following the Gulf War), remains a complex and confusing chapter in America's military history. What happened to the UN's peacekeeping efforts  that permitted such disaster? How did the thing start, anyway? Perhaps Boot will write something more substantial about these two wars at a later time. Judging from this work, he certainly seems like the historian to do it.	2004-12-02
US	49157966	R3H55JG50TXYM7	0192837028	368367935	Germinal (Oxford World's Classics)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	a complex tale of labor and strife, told with efficiency	After \\"L'Assommoir\\" and \\"Nana,\\" I was accustomed to Zola's \\"naturalist\\" style of reporting the details and constructing a story to make a point about Second Empire society. But \\"Germinal\\" surpasses those two, mainly due to Zola's efficiency. Middle-class readers in his day were likely to have invested more time than contemporary readers in reading (no search engines or video games in the late 19th century), so it's understandable why \\"Germinal\\" is so saturated with detail. That being noted, this is a masterfully written and passionate book that makes for fast reading. Zola is at his best evoking the coal elevator, the movements of an enraged crowd, the gossiping wives of miners, etc., giving the reader a clear description of the sights, sounds and smells of the moment.<br /><br />A few reviewers have interpreted this is a tale of oppresive capitalism. While much of symbolism (the mine that eats the workers, the sufferings of Catherine and so on) could give that impression, this is story of disasterous ideology. Set in 1866-1867, when the Civil War in the U.S. exacerbated the coal industry's overcapitalization in France, Etienne falls in love with the proto-socialist movement (instead of Catherine) and sets off catastrophe. The episode in which Etienne, Chaval and Catherine wait underground for their rescuers is a potent metaphor for his relationship with the miners.<br /><br />There are a number of very interesting characters in this book, who evolve to the decaying situations around them and often end up doing some very shocking things. Sprinkled with references to Darwin, \\"Germinal\\" features multiple characters that seems to revert to animal-like behavior. Whether Zola was not into economic progress as some suggest here is debatable, but there can be no mistake that he wanted to show the tremendous sacrifices that are involved. The change to the timbering rules by the company, the charge by the miners to Jean-Bart, and the act of sabotage by the Souvarine all havetheir disasterous unintended consequences. And it has been unintended consequences that defeated Marxism. In this way Zola was prophetic.<br /><br />Chaval is mostly portrayed as a cruel man who represents the natural urges that Etienne constantly battles. A very good website by a professor at Washington State mentioned that \\"Chaval\\" resembles \\"cheval,\\" which means \\"horse.\\" So the practicality, beast-of-the-mines existence of Chaval is linked by name to the very sympathetic horses in this story. In this way Chaval is a fully-developed character in \\"Germinal.\\"<br /><br />Does this book have contemporary interpretations? During the week that I read this, there were two newspaper stories about coal mining. One in the weekend Milwaukee paper, told of a labor shortage in American coal mines, where in Pennsylvania and Ohio, veteran miners are returning to the towns they once had to leave. Soon afterward, the N.Y. Times described a tragic collapse in a coal mine in the central Henan province of China, showing a picture of thin, grey-clad family members crowding a building next to the entrance to the mine, waiting for names of the survivors and the still missing. Given the (capitalist) history of the U.S. and the (Communist) history of China, would Zola be surprised by the content of these two newspaper stories in 2004?<br /><br />Coal mining in the U.S., of course, is a segment of the economy of which many environmentalists disapprove; its fate may be decided by the upcoming presidential election. Zola's \\"Germinal\\" is a masterpiece (I enjoyed the translation by Leonard Tanock), but its lessons may not be as simple as some readers may hope.	2004-10-27
US	49157966	R2S9F4MLW7WKRD	0140442634	101662800	Nana (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	18	18	N	N	gender-reversal during the decline of the Second Empire	In this novel, one of Zola's five or six \\"great books\\" about life during the Second Empire of France, we see a great number of men fall under the destructive influence of Nana, a demimonde who rose to fame from the backstreets of Paris. Nana is a prostitute, performer, socialite and celebrity all in one, making for a massive force of destruction. While every bit as earthy (and then some) as \\"L'Assommoir,\\" this story is not quite as grim; depending on your sense of humor, it is also funnier.<br /><br />For 1880, the descriptions of Nana's numerous trysts, games and affairs are, um, rather progressive, but this is a result of Zola's \\"naturalist\\" style. He collected copious notes on real figures at the time, and stood by the accuracy of his details. Nana did actually exist as a demimonde (or maybe a few), hastening the decadence of Napoleon III's France.<br /><br />The back cover misleadingly advertises this story is a \\"poem of male desires,\\" when it is Nana's desires and ambitions which drive the plot and dominate the imagery. Like no other book that I've read, \\"Nana\\" reverses the gender roles of its characters; with a fair amount of cross-dressing, homosexuality, physical abuse and assorted perversions. There are some dramatic scenes of degradation of Nana's men which are either 1.) some measure of revenge on men (Nana's mother experienced a lot of abuse in \\"L'Assommoir\\"), 2.) revenge on the wealthy, or 3.) expressions of boredom. Fans of \\"Fear Factor\\" might appreciate.<br /><br />Zola's themes have a lot of parallels today: decadence, fear of aging, and destructive affairs (look at what a divorce proceeding did to General Electric's share price). I had no problem with the translation by Mr. Holden, and the story is certainly not boring. \\"Nana\\" is probably not for anyone, certainly not for younger readers, but it deserves its reputation as a great book.	2004-10-19

The authors do a number of things well: they portray post-war King's College, they show how Wittgenstein's students reverence for their teacher, and they illustrate Bertrand Russell off to the side, not being of much consequence. That being said, I really did not get a feel for what Popper and Wittgenstein were arguing about, what their lives' works were, and after all these years, who turned out be in the right. If one wants to find out what modern philosophy \\"is like,\\" this book does not seem to be much help.  <br /> <br />This is an attempt to popularize a core conflict in modern philosophy, without all that bothersome thinking. I recommend Magee's \\"Confessions of a Philosopher\\" or Scruton's \\"Modern Philosophy\\" as alternate choices. <br />	2004-10-08

For me, Bittmann's volume has been that reference. It is the biggest reason why we still lack a microwave; and while it stands next to \\"The Joy of Cooking\\" above the stove, I always grab the big yellow book and let Joy collect dust.  <br /> <br />I found this book very useful when I was just learning the most basic dinners and needed instructions to do very simple tasks, but I continue to look at the large number of recipies now to find ideas. This cookbook has both quantity and detail. <br /> <br />For those who have room for one book in the kitchen, I recommend this one above all others.	2004-10-07

I first heard of John Neff in a cover story interview by Barron's in the second half of 2002 (I'm not sure when, exactly). He proclaimed in that issue that Citigroup was a once in a lifetime buy in the high $20's / share, and that there were many stocks at attractive values. Well, he turned out to be correct. In subsequent issues of Barron's, his reasons for buying stocks that always seemed to be out of favor at the moment have been consistent with the methodology explained clearly in this book. <br /> <br />\\"John Neff on Investing\\" is, in my opinion, a better book about value investing than the venerable \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" by Graham. The latter may be a classic and a favorite of Warren Buffett, but I found the former to be an exceptional communication of \\"Contrarian\\" investing principles.  <br /> <br />I would recommend finding a copy of this book, along with Lynch's \\"One Up on Wall Street\\" and O'Neill's \\"How to Make Money in Stocks\\" as very readable representations of different approaches one can take to investing in individual stocks.	2004-10-06

The first portion of the book introduces us to a pirate saga, replete with coastal empires, a slave-based economy and a mixture of alien and half-alien races. While complex, the story cleverly focuses around Bellis, a character who thinks to herself a lot and fills us in on enough history to understand the plot of \\"The Scar\\" and on an emotional level that keeps us interested.  <br /> <br />There's some technology components to the story, but this book seems to be much more epic pirate fantasy than science fiction. The pace of adventure is generally consistent, and the diction is  definitely above juvenile.  <br /> <br />I haven't read all of the preceding amazon reviews here, but \\"The Scar\\" seems to focus on tattoos as an important theme. I don't know if the author is \\"into\\" tattoos (I'm certainly not); but for something so prevalent among younger people today, it's nice to see it given some attention in literature. <br /> <br />The attention on scars, pain, treachery and blood certainly sets the mood in ways that my favorite adventure writers (P.J. Farmer, L.M. Bujold) don't do. It's not really gratuitous gore, but there's a lot of this stuff through the 500+ pages, which turns out to be a little much for me. <br /> <br />Overall, an excellent epic pirate story. Not for kids.	2004-10-06

I consider it a real triumph of A.A. supporters to keep the debate over (1.) rationale and not results, and (2.) the local school district or state college system. My test scores and grades in high school might have been good enough for a full scholarship at Univ. of Illinois, had I been anything other than a white male. Yet, I was convinced in those days that A.A. was merely overextended and still valid in many situations. Years of working have since taught me that those who were artificially promoted/admitted/etc. through A.A. were not, in the end, done any real favors. It's not the late 1990's anymore: the severe costs of hiring and firing in this country make it increasingly likely that an academic degree is insufficient to land someone the job one wants. They have to demonstrate some real ability. Hence, I became very skeptical about A.A. before ever seeing Dr. Sowell's book, but I had grown well beyond any personal bitterness from those collegiate admission days. You don't have to have some bugaboo about A.A. to appreciate this book.    This study is the result of travelling and in-depth research. Dr. Sowell has obviously thought about India, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Malaysia for a long time, and met with the people on multiple \\"sides\\" in each country. Unlike the proponents of A.A., he went out and collected the data. Reviewers here bring up Zimbabwe, but I think Dr. Sowell has done enough to show the implications of the politicization of ethnic differences. Judgements of A.A. are based on the examination of the outcomes, and if all you've previously heard about A.A. is the rhetoric, these judgements are going to strike you as extremely controversial.    A highly recommended purchase. The price looks high for a small book, but the brevity and clarity are assets in this case.	2004-09-11

I see many books on the shelf at the local bookstore proclaiming the coming victory by liberalism in the \\"battle\\" or \\"war\\" for America or American values or whatever. New York Times surveys, at least since Howell Raines took over, consistently are overweight on side of liberal responses, relative to actual results. In contrast, conservatives don't mind being different. This is especially true for college-age conservatives, and this is also the main lesson of the book. America's conservatism goes hand-in-hand with America's exceptionalism. I recommend this book for anyone wondering why America is so different from the rest of the world. <br /> <br />A good hard look is made by the authors in the apparent contradictions in the beliefs by so many in the conservative \\"movement,\\" and how America has been turning away from the Great Society policies over the years while Western Europe becomes more entrenched.  <br /> <br />Also notable is the summary of the intellectual pillars of conservatism (the Cato Institute, William Buckley, etc.), though I found that chapter to be rather dull. Otherwise, very readable and often clever. <br />	2004-09-10

Ehrenreich) recently for his NAACP speech. Who do we hold responsible for the various plights of the urban poor? <br />  <br /> Fans of the &quot;Great Society&quot; liberal approach to poverty may be well served by this story. Can &quot;Society&quot; be blamed for the unraveling of Gervaise and Coupeau, or are they merely weak people who lose a great battle to alcohol? Gervaise's decent into alcoholism happens after she has found success as a businesswoman. Coupeau starts to drink after an accident forces him into temporary idleness, but until then he was productive and capable of feeding his family. So I doubt that poverty is the beast that slays Coupeau and Gervaise. <br />  <br /> The clearest external cause to their demise could be the lack of familial support, as evidenced by the foul attitude of the Lorilleux. There does not seem to be anybody trustworthy for Gervaise to turn to. And sadly, in the end she abandons the young Nana for alcohol. <br />  <br /> Ironically, the stinginess and dedication to profit margins exhibited by the Lourilleux seem to be the best tools to escape poverty. Gervaise, by comparison, is overly forgiving to Coupeau's habits and is too sloppy of a manager to keep her enterprise.  <br />  <br /> Other reviewers here may see a clear case of the poor being miserable victims of their circumstances. After all, Gervaise has triumphant moments throughout the middle chapters only to collapse 2/3 into the book. I can't help but think that, despite all the poverty and filth, Zola holds the parents here ultimately responsible for the fate of their children, and Gervaise's failure in this regard excuses us from the task of pity. <br />	2004-07-22

Its analysis and opinions are encapsulated in the numbers, systematically compiled for any common stocks worth considering as investments. Any individual investor would see that at one dollar, IBD is a bargain. &quot;How to Make Money in Stocks&quot; is the guide to understanding the ratings of IBD, as well as a clear introduction to O'Neill's investing philosophy. The prevailing market conditions are very important to the success of CANSLIM, and reviews of the book written in the depths of the 2000-2002 stock funk may be colored indeed. <br />I, too, had some questions about &quot;pivot points,&quot; etc. that seem sparsely described. This is because you are supposed to look at the charts. If this isn't enough, look at more charts (the book has plenty). &quot;Pivot points&quot; and &quot;accumulation&quot; are not exact concepts, so one has to practice looking at the chart and acquire an understanding of these concepts. &quot;How to Make Money in Stocks&quot; is one of those rare books that relies on the graphical presentation of data as much as copy writing to communicate its sometimes fuzzy ideas.<br />This book is superb at describing the CANSLIM method on analysis, which can be done these days with free internet sources. An excellent description for novices of investing research.<br />My advice would be to pick up this book, read it, buy a copy of IBD, and keep track of ten or so stocks for 60 days or so. If the market goes up and these stocks don't, look for a better method. If you need more comforting words in the newspaper to guide your money decisions, drop this stuff and hire some investment professional.	2004-06-04

There is a real pathological hatred of women that plays out in Slim's foul treatment of his prostitutes. Homo-eroticism abounds in Slim's relationships with other, especially more senior pimps. Slim rots in confinement for some time, and guess what, he doesn't enjoy it. This story is good antidote to the pervasive and unambiguous sexuality that gets portrayed on the rap videos (at least, it was when I last watched one in the mid 90's), which ignore the truly aberrent aspects to the lifestyle that gets shamelessly glorified.	2004-06-03

This book gives one a sense of what the neighborhood of Gion must have been like during the pre-WWII industrialization period, and what it meant to Japan in those years. I suppose there's some message about Japanese gender roles in general in this book, but I found the real question to concern the value of entertainment. Why is it so necessary to have women specializing in this form of entertainment, especially when it often devolves into silly drinking games? Is it really a sad thing, as some travel writers suggest, that these days there are very few geisha around? Is &quot;culture&quot; really worth donating girls at an early age to some sort of museum-existence?<BR> <BR>Nowadays one can spot glimpses of geisha in Gion hurrying to their appointments in the early evening (with some luck).

While more useful than the &quot;Let's Go&quot; book, the LP version has some very flawed contents. The directions to the top recommended ryokan / guesthouses in Hiroshima and Tokyo were poor or nonexistant. Landmarks and restaurants shown on the maps no longer existed in Ginza, Ikebukuro and Kyoto. The photos and history are nice, but in my opinion a wasteful padding. I'd much rather have a $20 book without the fluff, or at least a $27 book that's accurate. Cities change and mistakes are made, but when LP's writers place a ryokan at the top of the list (incidentally, the &quot;best budget option&quot; in Tokyo proved to be extremely overrated by this book), there should be a premium placed on the traveller being able to find the place. I gave LP 2 stars instead of 1 for the very valuable advice to purchase a 7-day rail pass before visiting Japan (but did not distinguish between a &quot;green car&quot; ride and an ordinary ride; in my experience, the ordinary non-smoking cars were spacious enough). If and when Fodor's/Frommer's comes out with a new edition, it will almost certainly be a better value than LP.	2004-06-01
