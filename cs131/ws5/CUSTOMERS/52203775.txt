In this book, Grant Palmer presents what has been going on in Mormon historical research since 1945.  I recommend it to any Mormon who wants to know what has been going on in the \\"New Mormon History\\". <br /> <br />The \\"New Mormon History\\" began in 1945 with the publication of Fawn M. Brodie's No Man Knows My History.  Since then, scholarship has tended to confirm, rather than deny Brodie's thesis that the nature of Mormonism was evolutionary in character.   <br /> <br />Mr. Palmer obviously has great love for his church.  He seeks to remain a member.  However, the historical problems he enumerates are precisely the historical problems that lead me out of the Mormon church where I happily remain today.	2005-05-11

Thomas Steele, S.J. deserves high praise for collecting so many of Archbishop Lamy's sermons.  Preaching was a different endeavour back in the 19th century.  It is impressive to see a preacher so rooted in scripture.  His usage of scripture would not be approved of in today's Catholic seminaries, but Lamy shows himself to be a preacher who was rooted in the word of God.<br /><br />Archbishop Lamy, like most American bishops before and after him was no theologian.  Steele bring this point out quite well.  Lamy never claimed to be one.  Lamy was very French, and very much a product of French Catholic formation.  His spirituality, despite having spent most of his life in the United States, was very French and Steele brings this out quite well.  Berulle and others of the French school of spirituality influenced Lamy deeply.  Lamy was, I believe, a product of French Sulpician formation and his spirituality and preaching reflects those influences.<br /><br />Archbishop Lamy's arrival in Santa Fe was essentially a clash between two very different cultures.  Catholics in America were often treated quite harshly.  In many ways, they were and are different from their Protestant neighbours.  Lamy very much wanted the Church to be respectable, and the Penitentes and other Spanish devotional practices did not help in that quest.  Catholicism appeared very strange to the Americans, both in its French and Irish forms.  The Spanish spirituality is very, very different from the spirituality favoured by the French, the Irish, and Germans.  Lamy favoured all things French quite naturally.  In a city that is predominantly Spanish, he left a French Romanesque cathedral.  While he no doubt loved the people that he served, he remained a Frenchman at heart.  To Lamy, what was proper and what a church should look like was something French.  Steele brings these points out nicely.<br /><br />I have some reservations about the book as well.  It is marred by its editor's unfortunate Jungian tendencies.  In the footnotes and elsewhere in the book, Steele talks about tapping into Jungian archetypes and such like.  I do not know that Jung's psychology and Catholicism can ever be reconciled.  I seriously doubt that they can be.<br /><br />He also tries to run the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) on Lamy.  Many of the religious orders in the United States have gone for the MBTI in a big way.  Some, have even used it to teach those in formation how they are supposed to pray.  The MBTI is in some ways a new astrology.  Persons of one type don't get along with persons of another.  Person born under one sign don't get along well with persons born under another.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, it is a book well worth owning for those more interested in learning about New Mexico's first bishop.y its editor's unfortunate Jungian tendencies.

In this work, he seeks to portray Vicar Ortiz, the pastor of St. Francis Parish (now St. Francis Cathedral in Santa Fe, NM) as more sinned against than sinning. <br /> <br />The foreword to this work sets for the tone for the whole book.  The author of the foreword, quoting Chavez accuses Archbishop Lamy's Vicar General, Father (later Bishop) Joseph Machebeauf with latent homosexuality, and thus he is quite repulsed by normal sexual relations.  His close friendship with Archbishop Lamy (they use the term particular friendship or amiti particulire, in which the accent mark is omitted in the second word) is seen as an extension of that latent homosexuality.  It is really irresponsible to pin such labels on people without proof. Machebeuf suspects all Spanish priests as being womanisers and thus uses his close friend, the Archbishop, to persecute and destroy the Spanish Church in New Mexico. <br /> <br />It is true that Archbishop Lamy came from a totally different world view than his clergy did.  He was educated in a Sulpician framework with a very French spirituality.  Archbishop Lamy was doing what he felt was best.  As a priest formed in the French tradition, he is likely to approach certain matters differently than the Spanish clergy might.  You have a bishop who is educated in France and spent his priesthood in Ohio.  His approach is going to be vastly different from someone who grew up in Taos. <br /> <br />I don't think that this work does Fray Angelico Chavez any favours.  It is full of conspiracy theories from start to finish about how the evil French clergy came to destroy the Spanish Church in New Mexico.	2005-03-10

Now that 15 years have passed since his death, perhaps the time has come for a calmer reappraisal of the maestro and his work. <br /> <br />Richard Osborne has produced an exceedingly well written and well researched book.  I was impressed by just how much of Karajan's personality he was able to capture.  His focus on Karajan's use of technology is highly appropriate.  Karajan helped to develop the compact disc, was one of the earliest conductors to switch over to digital recording, worked to develop a market for classical music home videos, and was very much interested in musical/medical research.   <br /> <br />This is a calm and measured approach to Karajan's legacy.  In this biography, we find that Karajan the man was quite different to the stories told about him.  It also deals with the highly controversial aspects of Karajan's membership in the Nazi party.	2004-11-15

He has taught legions of students at Brigham Young University in Provo and his books are to be found in many Latter-Day Saint homes.   <br /> <br />In this book, Nibley attempts to defend the Mormon prophets from their critics.  I've not read all the essays in this book, but I have read No Ma'am That's Not History which is a response to Fawn M. Brodie's 1945 biography of Joseph Smith (revised in 1971). <br /> <br />His defense is well meaning but it is non-scholarly.  He does many of the things in his own writing that he accuses Brodie of doing.  He accuses Brodie of bias and accuses her of selectively using sources which fits her preconceived ideas.  Yet Nibely does this often in his own work.  He accuses Brodie of violating the law of parsimony (also known as Occam's Razor) yet he violates the law of parsimony far more than Brodie does.  He refuses to admit that Mormonism has changed and has changed greatly since its founding in 1830.  In no where else is this as evident as in Mormonism's teaching of God.  In Mormon 7:7, the Book of Mormon states that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God.  Yet Mormonism later came to accept polytheism (or henotheism as some Mormon apologists prefer).  Rather than one God, now there is more than one god, and faithful Mormons may become gods in their own right. <br /> <br />Thus, using the law of parsimony, the most logical deduction is that the development of Mormonism was evolutionary.  Nibley is unwilling to make this logical deduction. <br /> <br />In No Ma'am That's Not History, Nibley later degenerates into taking quotes out of context, putting words into Brodie's mouth, and name calling. <br /> <br />This is a well-meaning defense of Mormonism, but I must warn prospective readers that despite the veneer of scholarship, these are decidedly non-scholarly defenses of Mormonism and do not deserve the name of scholarship.	2004-09-13

The articles are certainly well written, and I'm certain that it has found a welcome place in many libraries and the homes of Latter-Day Saints.  Not all the articles are by LDS writers.  An article on the RLDS church has been written by RLDS historian Richard P. Howard.  That in itself is a welcome sign of progress having been made in LDS and RLDS (now known as the Community of Christ) relations.<br /><br />However, this does not mean that it is wholly unbiased or objective.  There are flaws in several articles.  Two of the most glaring involve the 1826 trial of Joseph Smith (which the authors still believe Smith was found innocent of), and ignores recent discoveries by the Rev. Wesley P. Walters.  In 1971 and 1975, Walter unearthed documents which prove that Smith was indeed found guilty of being a disorderly person.  The documentary history would seem to support such a charge and to gloss over it as if it did not happen is unfair.<br /><br />Also, we see that the Mormon church has not yet come to terms with the Book of Abraham.  The discovery of the papyri used in the Book of Abraham translation, as well as Joseph Smith's Egyptian Alphabet and Grammar, were certainly great historical finds.  However, these are glossed over and the authors do not deal with the fact that these papyri have been shown to have nothing whatsoever to do with Abraham, but are actually from the Egyptian Book of the Dead.<br /><br />This is an excellent resource in many ways.  However, the reader should be aware that not all the articles are posessed of scholarly objectivity.	2004-09-07

I read this book about a year ago.  I found it immensly disturbing.  Yet, at the same time, it is a fascinating and important book.  I've not known many Christian Scientists, but I have read Science & Health and am well acquainted with many of the ideas of Mary Baker Eddy. <br /> <br />Among the contributions of Mary Baker Eddy has been to highlight the relationship between faith and health.  However, I do believe that one should not negate medical science.  The world in which Mary Baker Eddy lived and our world today are vastly different.  Seeking healing through prayer might have very well been prudent in the 19th century.  Medical care was not what it is today.  I count myself as a religious person, but I don't see the need for abandoning medical care.     <br /> <br />While highlighting the good of Christian Science, Carolyn Fraser also lets us see another side.  It is a profoundly disturbing picture.	2004-09-04

Books	5	48	53	N	N	Excellent history of Mormonism	This is probably the best resource for the historical case against Mormonism.  The Tanners have spent their lives exposing the frauds and problems within Mormon history.  The wealth of documentation from this book is astounding.  One of the things that I like the most about it is in its use of sources.  Generally, they tend to use sources from within the Mormon church itself.  The records that they use are Mormon records and there is a wealth of primary sources, from the Journal of Discourses to the highly embarassing and racist talks given by some of the Mormon leaders.  It is a very critical look at Mormonism, and to those who wish to remain in the LDS church, I would advise that you really should not read it.  However, if you are having questions about Mormonism and its history, this is the place to go. <br /> <br />There are many excellent books on Mormonism, but for the sheer amount of information, this or their excellent work The Changing World of Mormonism (a condensed version of this book) should be a standard resource.   <br /> <br />While praising this book for its content, readers should be aware that the Tanner's writing style can be less than scintillating and occasionally very annoying, what with all the capitalisations, putting text in bold, and copious underlining.  However, their research doesn't lie.  After the Mark Hoffman forgeries, their credibility has been strengthened.  While Mormon historians were defending the notorious Salamander Letter, the Tanners were alone in their skepticism of the letter's authenticity.	2004-08-24

It covers so many events of his episcopacy and papacy.  It is certainly worthwhile reading.<br />George Weigel, moreso than other writers, is able to write on John Paul II's philosophy.  The teachings of John Paul II will be studied long after his death.  It is often forgetten that Pope John Paul II is an intellectual.  He studied in Rome under the great Thomist Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange.  And while he favours the moderate realism of St. Thomas Aquinas, the Pope by no means continues to work in that field alone.  He has integrated into his philosophy the insights of phenomenology and personalism.  The latter philosophy has proven especially important to him, and the insights of personalism appear often in his encylicals and other teaching documents.<br />In short, this is the perfect introduction to John Paul the Pope and John Paul the intellectual.	2004-06-29

However, autobiographies are not often fully honest.  Nor do they often capture the essence of the person.  Anthony Tommasini has accomplished both tasks.  His portrait of Thomson, while certainly uncompromising is neither a scandal volume and it certainly is not hagiographical.  He portrays Thomson very much as he was.<br />At the time when Thomson wrote his autobiography, American attitudes towards homosexuality were less than favourable.  His colleague, Henry Cowell had done time at San Quentin Prison for his homosexual relationships with young men.  Tommasini very frankly discusses Thomson's many relationships, particularly his long relationship with the painter Maurice Grosser.<br />Tommasini obviously does hold his subject in high esteem.  However, that does not preclude Tommasini's critical look at his subject.  He presents us with a portrait of an often irascible composer/critic whose contributions to American musical life have not yet been fully realised.  Bernstein's statement on the death of Thomson unfortunately rings true today: 'we loved his music but rarely played it.'  Hopefully, those who read Tommasini's work will become more interested in the extraordinary oeuvre of Virgil Thomson.  His is a unique voice.  Hopefully, it will be recovered.	2004-06-24

Michael Jones has written much on the problems of modernism and the modern world.  Gropius and his cohorts have given us an architecture that is bland in the extreme.  The sexual revolution has caused untold harm.  I admire and respect some of his earlier work, but I really must disagree with Jones with respect to Arnold Schoenberg.<br />Schoenberg was in many ways a traditionalist.  Despite his often groundbreaking work, and with exceptions such as the Five Orchestral Pieces, he kept Brahmsian rhythms and more or less worked in classical forms.  This is especially true of Schoenberg's last period.  Schoenberg did not see himself as a revolutionary.  He saw himself as one carrying on the Austro-German school of composition, a school that he viewed as absolutely central to music as a whole.  It was his hope that his new theories of composition would maintain the dominance of the Austro-German school for at least a hundred years.<br />This has not happened.  If anything, Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern are the summation of the Austro-German school of composition.  Schoenberg was at the heart of the Austro-German school.  <br />Jones, in stating that Schoenberg ventured into atonality because of an unfaithful spouse, really is taking things too far.  I don't think that he adequately understands Schoenberg's place in music.  It is a pity because rock music and other forms of popular music have been terribly destructive as he rightly points out.  Unfortunately, Jones does not posess an adequate understanding of the traditionalist roots of Arnold Schoenberg.	2004-05-26

I cannot imagine what it would be like to be in Thomas Stuart Ferguson's position.  Here we have a man who devoted so much in the way of time and treasure to prove that the Book of Mormon was true.  He wrote many books defending the Book of Mormon from an archeological point of view.  Yet he came to see that archeology and history will not vindicate the book of Mormon.  He lost faith in the Book of Mormon completely.<br />I had the good fortune some years past to meet the author of this book.  He gave a presentation on his findings with regards to Ferguson.  I came away from that presentation somewhat amazed at the chameoleon nature of Thomas Stuart Ferguson.  He had no faith in the Book of Mormon and even indicated so to Jerald and Sandra Tanner.  Yet, he still continued to attend church regularly.  To those who had questions about the Book of Mormon, he could give answers in either direction.  To faithful Mormons seeking faith building material, he could and would give out much information that would confirm them in their faith.  To Mormons questioning the historical veracity of the Book of Mormon, he could and would give out much information that would demonstrate the historical and archeological problems involved in the Book of Mormon.<br />He was a complex character.  However, his story is very much worth telling.  He is fortunate to have found a sympathetic biographer in Stan Larson.	2004-05-19

However, rather than dismissing this book out of hand, I decided to read it.  I do agree with Professor Jenkins' assesment of it.  It is an example of anti-Catholicism by Catholics.<br />Wills is certainly in favour of the ordination of women.  However, I do believe that Wills is fully open to the ecumenical ramifications.  For instance, the Orthodox Churches do not ordain women, and their likelihood of so doing is slim to none.  In addition, large numbers of Anglicans are unhappy with the ordination of women.  The existence of the Continuing Churches (Anglican Church in America, Anglican Catholic Church, etc.) bears this out, as does the presence of Anglican Use parishes in communion with Rome, and those Anglicans who've found a home in Orthdoxy.  In addition, the Church of England has bishops who minister to those faithful who reject the ordination of women.  <br />His writing on Marian devotion is likewise unbalanced.  He does not take into account the sophiology of St. Louis de Montfort and the role that the Holy Spirit plays in Marian devotion.  Marian devotion should lead us to the triune God.  Marian devotion should not lead us away.  <br />His writing on priestly celibacy is likewise flawed.  He would seem to jettison anything of the church's traditional disciplinary norms that seems too hard or demands too much.  Our society has lost the ability for sacrifice.  It is precisely the witness of the celibate committment that is needed today.  <br />Gary Wills is an intelligent man and a gifted writer.  However, one wonders whether he can or should in good conscience call himself a Catholic.	2004-05-19

These things are difficult, in and of themselves, to put into words.<br />I must take issue with a previous reviewer.  A previous reviewer had stated that Abby Whiteside had not produced any major pianists.  This is simply not true.  The late pianist and composer Robert Helps was a student of hers.  He specialised in 20th century music and he was particularly renowned for his skill at interpreting the thorny piano works of Roger Sessions.  His technical were indeed formidable.

However, I cannot give it my full reccommendation.  It is certainly well researched.  It has some serious flaws however.<br />He does to try to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre and the four bishops under him were not excommunicated by Pope John Paul II.  He speaks of latae sententiae penalties.  Latae sententiae penalties of excommunication take place automatically.  However, you have to be aware of the fact that what you are doing can result in excommunication.  You must be aware of the penalties involved.  Nemeth says that the Vatican was too hasty in imposing a latae sententiae excommunication.  Indeed, Canon Law does state that excommunication and other ecclesiastical sanctions have a medicinal purpose.  However, I think that he is confusing ferrendae sententiae penalties with latae sententiae penalties.  The former are imposed by an ecclesiastical authority.  The latter occur automatically because of the act itself.  The act of consecrating a bishop without a papal mandate is a latae sententiae excommunication.  Archbishop Lefebvre was warned by the Holy See not to consecrate the four bishops because if he did, he would be excommunicated automatically.  By virtue of the act itself, he is excommunicated.  There are extenuating factors, as Nemeth points out.  But can you really claim a state of necessity to carry out these consecrations?  Bishops in the Czech Republic who ordained other bishops without pontifical mandates were not excommunicated, as bishops were necessary for the existence of the Church in that country and they were rarely in communication with Rome, due to life behind the Iron Curtain.<br />Nemeth also quotes Rosalio Cardinal Castillo Lara, sometime President of the Pontifical Council for the Authentic Interpretation of Legislative Texts.  In an artice in La Repubblica, Cardinal Lara states that the consecration of a bishop is not in and of itself a schismatic act.  The Society has leaped on that text, and still continues to use it.  However, in later interviews with Cardinal Lara, the Cardinal does state that in his view, the penalty for schism does apply.  Fidelity Magazine has published a series of articles on this question.	2003-12-09

As Secretary of the Consilium, the group charged with carrying out the reforms mandated by Vatican II, he was in a position to influence exactly how the reform was carried out.  He was rewarded with an archbishop's mitre and made first secretary to the Congregation of Divine Worship.  This congregation was later suppressed by Paul VI, and Archbishop Bugnini was exiled and made papal nuncio to Iran.<br />I do not know whether it will ever be proved conclusively that Bugnini was a freemason.  This controversy continues still.<br />As far as a one-volume history of the reform goes, it is a useful book.  Archbishop Bugnini introduces his reader to the persons behind the reform.  It should be noted that some of the greatest liturgists of the 20th century, i.e., Joseph Jungmann, SJ, Bernard Botte, OSB, Aime-Georges Martimort, Louis Bouyer, and others all took part in the liturgical reform.<br />The reason that I have rated it as low as I have is for the fact that it is a self-aggrandising and narcissistic memoir.  I do not know the particular demons that the late Archbishop may have been struggling with.  However, he does not come off well in the text.  While writing frequently in the third person, were one to believe his work, the Consilium and he did nothing wrong and the results were greeted with joy almost unanimously.  In the preface by his student Gottardo Pasqualetti, his student speaks of how the Archbishop desired the words: &quot;He served the Church&quot; engraved on his tombstone.<br />Forty years since Sancrosanctam Concilium, the reforms demanded by Vatican II still have not been implemented fully.  The liturgy has deteriorated at an alarming rate.  The Catholic traditionalist movement is growing.  The late Archbishop Lefebvre has a significant following, as do groups utilising the old Mass in communion with Rome.  Many Catholics have sought refuge in either the Eastern Rites, or in some cases, in orthodoxy itself.  Has the new liturgy brought forth good fruit?  It still remains to be seen.oxy itself.

Books	5	4	8	N	N	A plea for liturgical sanity	Denis Crouan once again gives us an excellent analysis of the current liturgical situation.  Crouan is committed to the post-conciliar liturgy.  He pleads for the return of the Latin in the celebration of the liturgy, along with the official music of the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, that of Gregorian Chant.<br />His examples are drawn from France, but are highly applicable to the situation in the United States and Canada.  Much of the same silliness that perdures in France is much in evidence here.<br />It is my prayer that the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council will one day be fully implemented.  There is quite a stark contrast between what Vatican II called for, and what is in practice in many of our parishes.  Once again, Crouan pleads for an understanding of the liturgy in light of conciliar teaching.<br />In making the liturgy their own private property, many priests, so-called &quot;liturgists&quot;, and others are depriving the people of a very important right.  As John Paul II reminds us, the people have a right to participate in a liturgical celebration that is celebrated as the Church intends it to be.	2003-11-13

I do agree with the premises of Denis Crouan, and I sharply disagree with the other two reviewers below.  I used to be a huge supporter of the Tridentine Latin Mass, and while I still esteem it highly, I also love the post-Conciliar Mass.  I was very fortunate throughout my seminary formation and even before I entered the seminary (I'm still a seminarian) to witness the post-conciliar liturgy as it ought to be celebrated.  I've also seen it as it should not be done.<br />The Tridentine Rite was abrograted by Paul VI when he introduced the post-conciliar reforms.  Nevertheless, Paul VI permitted the older rite to be used in certain cases.  This was expanded upon by John Paul II, particularly in the motu proprio Ecclesia Dei Adflicta.  I must disagree with the previous two reviewers.  <br />The post-conciliar liturgy can and should be celebrated beautifully.  Not many people, sad to say, have seen it as it can be celebrated.  There is an unfortunate tendency towards minimalism, particularly in America.  When the new liturgy is celebrated well, it can be quite moving.  In many ways, the attacks on the new liturgy by traditionalists are more against models of celebration they have seen, rather than as the church actually envisions their celebration.  I, as well as many other Catholics, deplore the current state of our liturgy.  This excellent book points to a way forward.	2003-11-13

Dohnanyi was one of the foremost musicians of his age.  He was a great musician.  He was a great pianist, a marvelous composer, and a wonderful teacher.  Bartok was a friend and student of his, eventhough their attitudes towards music differed greatly.  He influenced a whole generation of Hungarian musicians through his work as director of the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest.<br />This book is a touching tribute to the resilience of the human spirit.  Before World War II, he was hailed as a great musician.  He enjoyed great celebrity and toured the world as a concert pianist.  He was the central figure in Hungary's musical life before World War II.  During, and at the end of World War II, he and his third wife (the author of this work) became refugees in Austria.  Two of his sons died in concentration camps in Hungary and in Germnay.  He was falsely accused of being a war criminal, an accusation which haunted him his whole life.  Finally settling in the US, he regained something of his former reputation.<br />To all those interested in musicians an earlier age, I recommend it highly.  Some musical background will be helpful, but really it is a book for everyone.  Having lost some of his family members and permanently exiled from his beloved homeland, he still retained his optimism, even after having undergone terrible persecutions and privations.  His story is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.	2003-09-02

I was a student of Fr Miller's at St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, CA.  It is a good text for first getting one's feet wet, and I continue to refer to it in my own preaching from time to time.

Nevertheless, I found this book profoundly helpful in developing a good keyboard technique.  While it won't help the organist with pedalling (you would have to consult Gleason on that one!), it will help you develop a solid and flawless keyboard technique.  The organist must base his or her organ technique on a good piano technique.  Even though the fingering is slightly different from the piano to the organ, much can be gained from Sandor.  I would highly reccommend this book to any organist or pianist.  It is a good, common sense guide to piano technique. Gone are Hanon and Czerny!	2002-09-28

During the period of the restoration of Gregorian chant in the late 19th and early 20th century, a system of understanding Gregorian rhythm was put forth by Dom Andre Mocquereau, O.S.B., a priest of the Benedictine Abbey of Solesmes and a great Gregorian chant scholar.  His method became widely used throughout the world and gave the chant the beauty for which it was renowned.  One of his students, Dom Eugene Cardine, O.S.B. (also a monk of Solesmes) sought to study the question of rhythm anew.  By returning to the manuscripts, he sought to bring forth rhythmic subtleties which had not been addressed in the method of Dom Andre Mocquereau.  This little book seeks to introduce the reader to Gregorian Semiology, that is reading the ancient notation and the rhythmic signs of the ancient manuscripts.  This book is a wonderful introduction to reading the the neums of St. Gall.  This will also ease the reader into understanding and using the Graduale Triplex (a version of the Graduale Romanum with the medieval square notation, the neums of Laon, and the neums of St. Gall).  To those musicians who would be interested in learning the chant, I can think of no better beginning resource than this.	2002-09-08

This excellent biography of St. Philip Neri presents a complete portrait of the great 16th century &quot;Apostle of Rome&quot;, St. Philip Neri.  Rather than stressing the excessive asceticism of the time, St. Philip emphasised the great love and mercy of God, thus bringing back many people to the practise of the faith and and inspiring many to lead holy lives.  <br />It presents the reader with a picture of St. Philip, a man both on fire for the Lord and a saint with an immense sense of humour.  This is one of the best biographies of St. Philip that I've found and I reccommend it highly.	2002-06-08

The life of the late Terence Cardinal Cooke has been a great inspiration to me.  He suffered greatly during the last few years of his life.  Fr. Groeschel sets out a wonderful portrait of a man who was totally devoted to God and his people.  During the last nine years of his life, Cardinal Cooke suffered from cancer.  Yet, he did not wish that be known.  He did not wish to be \\"a lame duck Archbishop\\".  He would receive chemotheraphy and then continue the arduous schedule of the Archbishop of New York.  He kept this up for nine years.  It is for this reason that the Catholic Church is considering making him a saint.  He was one who spent his life for God and his people on earth.	2002-02-03

As an ex-mormon who is now a Catholic, much of Mr Bennett's journey is familiar to me.<br />Mormonism indeed posesses  a colourful history and fascinating background.  Joseph Smith was clearly a  creative genius.  Like Charles Taze Russell, the religious movement he  founded has continued to endure.<br />Mr. Bennett does justice to Mormonism.   Above all, he remains charitable throughout.  Unfortunately, this cannot be  said of other critics of Mormonism.	2000-07-26

Blessed Josemaria Escriva shows us how to take the common everyday events of our lives, and use them to help us advance in holiness as well as  in love of God and of neighbour.  <br />This book is very much in harmony with  the Second Vatican Council.  Blessed Josemaria preached that holiness is  not merely reserved for the clergy and the religious (nuns and religious  brothers), but for everyone.  One of the things that Vatican II taught is  the universal call to holiness.  All of us, no matter what state of life we  are called to be, whether it is as priest or religious, single person or  married couple, are called to live holy lives.  This book understands that  message and proclaims it.	1999-07-18
