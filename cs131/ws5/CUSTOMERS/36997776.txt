As a faithful watcher of Sex and the City I really thought I was in for a treat to read Candace Bushnell's Four Blondes.  But I soon learned I should stick to watching HBO reproduce her idea. <br /> <br />The books is actually four short novellas about young, wealthy, beautiful and glamourous women and their sex lives.  And little else.  The author leaves each of the four stories unfinished with loose ends.  There was little substance to each story and then an arubt, but certainly welcome from the boredom of reading it, botchy ending. <br /> <br />If you have heard of Candace Bushnell and are thinking of giving her books a go, I would definitely suggest skipping the author and going straight to your television set and watching an episode of Sex and the City.	2004-08-18

After reading and loving Evans' first book, The Christmas Box, I was eager to get my hands on A Perfect Day.  However, The Perfect Day left a very sugary taste in my mouth from its sappiness.  I like a good love story with a feel good happy ending but this one was over the top. <br /> <br />The main character is Robert Harlan.  A 9-5 jobber who wants to break free and pursue his dream of becoming an author.  He also has the perfect marriage to his true love, Allyson.  When Robert is fired from his job Allyson pushes him to pursue his dream and write his book.  So he sets out with pen in hand and writes the story of Allyson's last days with her dying father.  Of course the novel becomes a huge hit and skyrockets to the top of the chart.  However, all the glitz and glamour that comes along with a bestselling novel puts a little too much strain on Robert and Allyson's marriage. <br /> <br />I know that author Richard Evans has a knack for writing good love stories.  The proof is in his novel The Christmas Box.  But if you don't want to visit a dentist for the cavities you'll get from A Perfect Day's sappy sweetness, leave it on the shelf.	2004-08-18

However, some of the characters seemed a little too created with Eddie being way too perfect and the reverend's wife being way too conniving.  All in all this was an enjoyable book but just a little rough on the edges.

This novel explores the options, or lack thereof, of having a demanding career and being a good wife and mother in the process.  This book also exposes the real difference in how the world views working mothers vs. working fathers.
