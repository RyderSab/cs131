In Bookworms, edited by Laura Furman and Elinore<BR>Standard, you will find a variety of essays and quotes on your<BR>favorite subject.<br />The first section was for me the most interesting. Entitled The<BR>Young Reader, it contained explanations by a variety of folks on<BR>how they first learned to read. If you enjoy keeping a list of<BR>the books you have read or if you have ever tried to master one<BR>of the 100 books you absolutely have to read lists, you will<BR>enjoy Richard Rodriguezs experiences. The more he read, the more<BR>he discovered he needed to read next. At the library, he<BR>remembers, I would literally trembled as I came upon whole<BR>shelves of books I hadnt read. So I read and I read and I read.<BR>. . .<br />Or perhaps you remember those first exciting moments when you<BR>discovered a certain author, especially one who had a whole<BR>series of books. In this case, you will identify with Hal Borland<BR>who first came across real books while visiting a neighbor on the<BR>prairies of Colorado. When she loaned him a copy of Coopers The<BR>Last of the Mohicans, he had walked halfway home before he came<BR>up for air.  I had just discovered a world of horizons beyond<BR>horizons, he remembers, a world I couldnt see even from the<BR>top of the hay stack on a clear day. I had found something that<BR>would shape my whole life. As I trudged on, I began to sense my<BR>discovery, a discovery even bigger than the plains.<br />The next section, entitled Sorts of Readers. You will probably<BR>concur with Joseph Epstein when he says, having too much to read<BR>isnt a problem; having to little to read has been on occasion.<BR>In paucity, never prolificacy, lies fear.<br />Do you find that men and women like different kinds of books?<BR>Tamar Lewin speaks of boy books and girl books, Men like<BR>anything wherethe point is the ideas, the landscape, or the<BR>action; girl books are about relationships, families, and the<br />details of daily life. Thus the war between the sexes is really<BR>the battle between Moby Dick and Little Women.<br />Other sections in this fascinating collection are Reading<BR>Aloud, Reading Ahead (which contains a timely essay on the<BR>impact of computers on the world of books),  Queen Lear<BR>(dealing with the way we use books to understand ourselves) and<BR>The Privileges Pleasure Finally there is a bibliography for<BR>those of you who want even more.<br />If you are a book addict, you will enjoy these essays.	2002-07-13

If you have already retired, you will be in<BR>the amen corner; if you are close to retirement, you will be<BR>drooling with anticipation; and if you like Frost have miles to<BR>go before you sleep, you will be green with envy. In \\"The First<BR>Year\\", John Mosedale describes the first year after he retired<BR>from being a writer for the CBS evening news. He had loved his<BR>career, he says, but he didn't miss it a bit.<br />Written as a series of journal entries, he describes the simple<BR>pleasures he experienced. He was able to leisurely peruse the New<BR>York Times and several other major newspapers. He could take an<BR>unhurried walk through the different neighborhoods of Manhattan.<BR>He was able to stay up late to watch the last quarter of Monday<BR>Night Football, knowing he could sleep in the next day. He could<BR>go through the shelves of disorganized books in his apartment and<BR>bring order to chaos. He could even visit his summer home, a<BR>cabin on an island in Minnesota, and stay as long as he wanted,<BR>instead of the rushed two or three weeks he had been able to<BR>spare during his working life. In short, he could do what he<BR>wanted when he wanted - a luxury that school teachers experience<BR>during the summer, at least partially compensating for the<BR>frenzied pace the rest of the year.	2002-07-12

This is *not* your normal Cornwell, so drop your expectations and I think you will enjoy this novel.<br />The plot itself is not particularly complex, but the fun for me was the collection of bumbling misfits who are at crosspurposes. Who, for example, could read this book without howling at the antics of Virginia's almost-blind, digestively-challenged, and most obtuse Governor Crimm?<br />It does have its flaws and sometimes she pushes the envelope with her weird characters, but I had fun with it.	2002-07-10

But when he is<BR>rescued from an ambush by a member of \\"January 30,\\" the newest<BR>and most dangerous terrorist organization, he has to wonder who<BR>his friends and enemies really are.<br />This is the nucleus of Jack Higgins' Angel of Death. And this<BR>novel is as well done as all of Higgins' other works. It has<BR>interesting characters, plenty of action, and well-written<BR>dialog.<br />Part of the fascination in this particular book is the inside<BR>view we get of \\"January 30.\\" Instead of the typical politically<BR>motivated fanatics, this group is composed of four persons - a<BR>Russian spy, a member of the British government, a college<BR>professor, and a young actress - united by the excitement of the<BR>hunt. For the spy, the purpose of their activities is a chaos<BR>that will ultimately yield the collapse of the British system,<BR>but the others are much more interested in the action than in the<BR>results.<br />When the group saves Dillon, therefore, it was not out of any<BR>hidden loyalty to the government. When he becomes involved in the<BR>government's attempt to achieve a stable peace in Northern<BR>Ireland, they know he will have to die. The struggle between the<BR>two is a major part of this novel, and Higgins is quite skilled<BR>in showing us both points of view and yet maintaining suspense.<br />But there are a number of other plots intertwined. At one point,<BR>for example, Dillon goes to the Middle East to deal with the arms<BR>dealer who had set up the ambush that opens the novel. He is<BR>there for only a few hours when he is recognized and captured by<BR>one of the many factions that are at war there. You know he is<BR>going to escape - it's much too early to kill of your main<BR>character - but I think the way it's done will surprise you.<br />Higgins also involves the United States in the story. In order to<BR>maintain the cease fire that is in existence in Ireland, the<BR>British Prime Minister requests President Clinton to send Senator<BR>Patrick Keogh (a modern JFK) to mediate between the two factions.<BR>But extremists on both sides are determined to prevent any real<BR>peace, so Dillon is selected to act as his body guard. And now<BR>\\"January 30\\" comes back into the picture.<br />This is a true page turner; I began it one Saturday morning and<BR>finished it before I went to bed that night. I had to know how it<BR>turned out before I could go to sleep!	2002-07-06

Of all the animals, man is only one that blushes -- or who needs<BR>to. He is also the only one that laughs, or at least that's what<BR>the naturalists claim. Perhaps it is because we humans are the<BR>funniest of the animals, and who better to point that out than<BR>the late Erma Bombeck?<br />In \\"All I Know About Human Behavior I Learned in Loehman's<BR>Dressing Room\\", Bombeck shares some of the observations made by<BR>the naturalists and then shows how humans are alike. The female<BR>elephant, for example, carries her calf for 660 days before<BR>giving birth and continues breeding until she is ninety years<BR>old. But Bombeck doesn't feel too sorry for the elephant; after<BR>all with her height she carries the extra weight quite well!<br />In the old days pregnancy was a real event in a woman's life; she<BR>was told to give up exercise and could eat whatever she wanted.<BR>Today, however, she has to exercise more than ever and everyone<BR>is watching what she eats. Birth is so ordinary that a female<br />jockey delivered only a few hours after her third race. Surrogate<BR>mothers made the old joke \\"Are you pregnant? No, I'm carrying it<BR>for a friend\\" reality, and frozen embryos are part of the divorce<BR>settlement!<br />Another notice tells of four dolphins who got lost and were<BR>trapped in a New Jersey river. Of course we all know they had to<BR>be men. Bombeck knows how to end all wars: \\"Let men give<BR>directions on how to get there.\\" Why don't men ask for<BR>directions? It would compromise their masculinity.<br />Of course animals are involved in many laboratory experiments.<BR>After wondering who got their permission, Bombeck continues: \\"I<BR>have never been in a laboratory where mice are involved in<BR>research. So when someone tells me they are being used to test<BR>the effects of cigarette smoke and alcohol and the consequences<BR>of too much sun, I have to believe there's a group of mice<BR>sitting around the pool, smoking and drinking Mai Tais and<BR>working on a tan.\\"<br />When she thinks of animal speed, she thinks of the IRS cashing<BR>your check (the fastest animal on earth) and giving a refund (the<BR>snail is faster). When she reads about the devices that are used<BR>to track animals in the wild, she remembers the various<BR>electronic devices we have to stay in touch. What should you<BR>record on that answering machine? \\"We're not home right now?\\"<BR>That's obvious. \\"We'll return your call?\\" What if it is a<BR>aluminum siding salesman?<br />This is not a connected narrative, but a series of sketches, each<br />based on a different piece of information about the animal<BR>kingdom. As a result, you can read this in a hurry or stretch it<BR>out. There are a few dry places, but this is a good book to bring<BR>with you while you are waiting for your appointment with the IRS.	2002-07-06

Our focus now shifts to the more<BR>\\"modern\\" times and the adventures of the New Generation crew.<br />Oops! There is one person who doesn't know about Kirk's death -<BR>and that is William Shatner, the actor who portrayed Kirk for<BR>over 25 years. And now in Star Trek: The Return, he tells us what<BR>happened after the end of the movie. The death that seemed so<BR>final may be cheated once more.<br />It seems that those bad old Romulans have now joined forces with<BR>the mechanical Borg to rescue Kirk's katra (shades of Spock's<BR>resurrection!) and to restore it to the body that they steal from<BR>the grave. Why would they be so kind? Obviously to have Kirk use<BR>his knowledge to destroy the one man who could stop their plans<BR>to take over the universe - Captain Pikard.<br />Of course no one, other than Spock, believes Kirk is still alive.<br />After all, Captain Pikard saw him die; he buried Kirk himself.<BR>But Spock reminds his friends that since he and Jim had shared<BR>their mind-meld, he would know if Kirk were dead.<br />Soon the plot thickens as different characters come into battle<BR>with the \\"dead\\" captain as Kirk tries to find out where Pikard is<BR>and to seek the revenge that the Borg planted in his brain.<br />Luckily, as we already know, Jim Kirk is a stubborn man, and soon<BR>begins to question part of the programming that has been inflicted on him. Thus there is hope that he can be rescued and<BR>then turned against the Romulan plot. For this to work, however,<BR>we are going to need the help of Riker, Spock, Data, Quark, Dr.<BR>Bashir, and even old Dr. McCoy (who is still going strong at 144,<BR>physically weakened by age, but mentally as alert and ornery as<BR>ever).<br />One of the interesting subplots in this book is Data's attempt to<BR>deal with his new emotion chip. Thus, likemany adolescents, he<BR>has learned a few good cuss words but doesn't know when they<BR>should be used and when they should be left alone! He is also<BR>facing the great emotional mood swings that are typical of the<BR>teen years.<br />This isn't the best written of the Star Trek novels; Shatner's<BR>strength is apparently on the stage, not behind his desk. But the<BR>story he tells is intriguing enough that it kept my interest<BR>throughout the book. <br />If you enjoy the Star Trek universe, this is a book you will want<BR>to read.	2002-06-22

I just finished Kiss and was fascinated with<BR>his characters and with the details of police life that he so<BR>carefully paints.<br />The story begins with a young woman who is suddenly attacked on a<BR>subway platform and pushed onto the tracks. It is only a miracle<BR>that she is able to pull herself onto the platform before the<BR>train rushes by. Just your typical New York afternoon, right?<BR>That's what she thinks until a week later when she is almost run<BR>over by a car that was apparently aiming for her. This time,<BR>however, she recognizes the driver, a man who used to work for<BR>her husband.<br />When she goes to detective Steve Carella, he quickly suspects her<BR>husband has somehow hired a hit man and cautions her to be<BR>careful. That doesn't seem plausible, though, for her husband has<BR>hired a private detective from Chicago to serve as her body guard<BR>and to conduct his own investigation. Emma Bowles feels Detective<BR>Carella must be mistaken.<br />As his inquiries continue, however, Steve becomes even more<BR>convinced that her husband is involved. The private detective,<BR>for example, seems to have rather questionable credentials; in<BR>fact, he even goes under an assumed name. When the man who was<BR>first trying to kill Emma winds up dead himself, the puzzle only<BR>gets more confusing.<br />The story isn't as straight-forward as this summery might appear.<BR>One of the joys of McBain's writing is the complexity of his<BR>universe. Most fictional detectives seem to have no interests<BR>other than the case they are on (and the mandatory woman they are<BR>\\"visiting\\"). Steve Carella is tied up in his own trial while he<BR>is investigating this case - his father had been murdered, and he<BR>and his mother are attending the trial of the man who had been<BR>caught. Even though his guilt wasobvious, it looked more and<BR>more as if the defense attorney was going to convince the jury to<BR>acquit.<br />Nor does the investigation run smoothly. Carella runs into dead<BR>end after dead end, but each time, he moves just a little closer<BR>to the truth.<br />Finally comes the solution. As the reader has long known, Emma's<BR>husband is a no-good scoundrel. But I think you will still be<BR>surprised at what happens! McBain's ability to show and to hide<BR>at the same time is amazing. This is truly good detective<BR>fiction.<br />No great literature here, but I'm going for more of the 97th<BR>precinct.	2002-06-22

Because God was more pleased with Abel's gift,<BR>Cain murdered his brother and was exiled for the rest of his<BR>life.<br />Cain may have been the first murderer, but unfortunately he was<BR>not the last. His question, \\"Am I my brother's keeper\\" is as<BR>crucial today as it was then. This crime is famous precisely<BR>because it is so universal.<br />It is no wonder that novelists have used this story in their own work. One of the most famous of these modern parables is \\"East of<BR>Eden\\" by John Steinbeck. In fact, he uses the story at least two<BR>times.<br />The first part of the novel focuses on two brothers, Charles and<BR>Adam Trask. As young boys their conflict began when their father<BR>shows favoritism for Adam and continues throughout their adult<BR>life, culminating on Adam's wedding night when Charles gets him<BR>drunk and sleeps with his new wife.<br />Nine months later Cathy's children (Steinbeck never tells us who<br />the father is) are born. Their very names, Cal and Aaron, tells<BR>us quickly that the Cain and Abel story is going to be continued<BR>in the new generation, and sure enough, it is. Adam, like his<BR>father before him, accepts a gift that Aaron gives him and<BR>rejects Cal's offering. <br />The result is tragedy, and the search for redemption begins<BR>again. When Cal asks if he can overcome the evil he finds within<BR>him, he realizes that the answer is that he may, showing that he<BR>has the power to choose good or evil for himself, a choice that<BR>makes him great.<br />But the power of this book lies not just within the story itself;<BR>the characters Steinbeck draws for us are among the most vivid in<BR>modern literature. In addition to the two sets of brothers is<BR>Cathy, one of the most corrupt women I have ever encountered.<BR>From the time she burns her own parents alive to the way she<BR>manipulates all of the men she encounters, she finds delight in<BR>evil.<br />Balanced against her is Samuel Hamilton, a good man who finds<BR>happiness in the land on which he lives and his many inventions.<BR>When he first meets the Trasks, Adam is devastated because Cathy<BR>has deserted her family to become a prostitute in nearby Salinas.<BR>Sam helps him to recover.<br />But my favorite character is Lee, the Chinese sage who plays the<BR>role of the typical subservient Chinaman, but who in private<BR>guides Adam and his boys. It is Lee who reveals the meaning of<BR>the Old Testament verb timshel as \\"thou mayest,\\" giving the gift<BR>of freedom to Cain and to us today. And it is Lee who must, at<BR>the end, try to keep this family from destroying itself<BR>completely.<br />Steinbeck is a powerful writer, and this is one of his most<BR>powerful novels. I envy you if this is your first time reading<BR>it.	2002-06-22

One<BR>Buddhist scholar she quotes says that reading is a handicap. \\"It<BR>is better to keep your own mind free and to not let the thinking<BR>of others interfere with your own free thinking.\\" As she thinks<BR>about her own life, she realizes that she doesn't remember much<BR>of what she's read and wonders if this means that she has not<BR>gained by it.<br />She even commits heresy by saying that she has managed \\"not to<BR>finish certain books,\\" and is proud of it. Still, she is unable<BR>to throw away any of those unread books; they remain on her<BR>shelves, even those she feels have no merit. She may hide them on<BR>a high shelf, but they remain part of her life.<br />She finally concludes that \\"unlike love, reading is a pure<BR>activity. It will gain us nothing but enchantment of the heart.\\"<BR>But for those of us who are \\"book addicts, perhaps that is<BR>enough.<br />This is a rather short book (119 pages), but I think book lovers<BR>will enjoy it.	2002-06-15

His story began about 7:00 on<BR>Christmas Eve at a time when he was not particularly merry. For<BR>one thing, Amory prides himself on being a curmudgeon, so \\"Bah,<BR>humbug\\" is his favorite expression. For another, he had recently<BR>divorced and was alone in an apartment far from his family.<br />He was not excited, therefore, when a volunteer in the Fund for<BR>Animals which he had founded came by and asked his help in<BR>rescuing a stray cat that was about to be killed by the tenants<BR>of the apartment building whose basement he had chosen for his<BR>temporary resident. He was even less happy after the battle was<BR>over. He might have captured the cat, but Amory's battle scars<BR>showed he was the worse for wear.<br />He agreed to keep the cat in his apartment for a couple of days<BR>until someone could be found to adopt him. Even though Amory<BR>loved animals, he felt there was no room in his life for one at<BR>this time. Soon, however, Polar Bear proved him wrong, for when<BR>he finally surveyed the apartment and this funny human, he<BR>decided it met his approval. The decision, you see, was not<BR>Amory's, but the cat's!<br />Of course Amory didn't immediately recognize the relationship.<br />When he decided this new cat needed a bath, the battle was on.<BR>Polar Bear knew what this man was trying to do, but he just<BR>couldn't believe it. \\"Wash a cat!\\" he exclaimed, \\"Boy, have I got<BR>my work cut out for me with this one!\\"  Amory decided a change of<BR>tactics was in order, but, he insists, it had nothing to do with<BR>Polar Bear's arched back and laid-back ears! They reached a<BR>compromise. Amory put the water in the sink, and Polar Bear got<BR>in on his own.<br />Compromises, in fact, proved to be the order of the day. After<BR>trying to teach his cat to play games or do tricks, Amory<BR>resorted to a simply request: \\"Come here.\\" He soon learned what<BR>every cat roommate knows: Cats do not come when they are called.<BR>Polar Bear finally agreed that if his human would inquire of the<BR>room, \\"Where is Polar Bear?\\" he,  in his own good time, would<BR>with great dignity appear.<br />And so the two learned to adapt. Or rather, Amory did. He learned<BR>that (1)cats do not travel, (2)cats do not take pills, (3)cats do<BR>not walk on a leash, (4)cats do not go on diets, and (5) cats<BR>will chose their own friends. He was a slow learner, but Polar<BR>Bear was a patient teacher!<br />This is a book every cat lover should read. It might even convert<BR>those of you who own dogs. Amory has given us a great Christmas<BR>present.	2002-06-15

You addicts will certainly want to grab<BR>Great Books by David Denby. For many years, Denby had made his<BR>living as a New York film critic, but when he turned 48, he<BR>wondered if there were more to life than he was experiencing. As<BR>part of his search, he returned to Columbia University, from<BR>which he had graduated many years previously and signed up for<BR>their two \\"Great Books\\" courses. He wanted to confront those<BR>writers again to see what meaning they had for him as an adult.<br />In this book, he writes about the books and about his reactions<BR>to them and to the classes he visited. \\"It wasn't just learning<BR>that excited me,\\" he writes, but the idea of reading the big<BR>books. I had grown into a book-buyer but not always a book-<BR>reader; a boon to the book trade, perhaps, but not a boon to<BR>myself.\\" <br />This book may be read on two levels. I found his journey<BR>fascinating and enjoyed the discoveries he made about himself and<BR>the reactions he had to the students who were half his age (and<BR>the reactions they had to him). But I also enjoyed the<BR>discussions of the books that made an impact on him. I must<BR>admit, however, that when he discussed books I had not read<BR>myself, I tended to skim a bit, slowing down when he returned to<BR>more familiar material.	2002-06-15

As a teacher, I have always argued that we need to maintain high<BR>grade standards in order to motivate our students to do their<BR>best work. The assumption behind my position is that students<BR>want to get A's and will work to avoid F's (at least most will). <br />This doesn't seem too radical. As parents, we make similar<BR>assumptions. We reward our children when they behave in ways we<BR>approve, and we punish them when they misbehave. We might argue<BR>about whether spanking is a good punishment or whether sending a<BR>high school student to his or her room is effective, but we agree<BR>about the efficacy of rewards and punishment.<br />Employers and supervisors would agree. We reward our employees<BR>with pay raises when they do a good job; some jobs even provide<BR>merit pay for their for the best workers.<br />But after reading Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn, I have some<BR>reservations. According to Kohn, rewards are not only<BR>ineffective; they even prevent the behavior we want to encourage!<br />The book starts off with a review of the psychological school of<BR>determinism and the work of B.F. Skinner. It's a bit technical<BR>here, but it is clearly enough written that most readers can wade<BR>through it with no problems. Then comes the heart of the argument<BR>- offering rewards is actually counter-productive.<br />In one study, for example, pre-kindergarten children were given<BR>the chance to draw with Magic Markers, something almost all<BR>children love to do. When one group was told they would receive<BR>gold stars if they drew pictures, however, their interest seemed<BR>to drop, and when the gold star rewards were withdrawn, many of<BR>the children quit drawing! The reward took the pleasure out of<BR>the task, making it a job that was done only for the sake of the<BR>reward.<br />What does this say about our summer reading programs, where we<BR>give students hamburgers (or other rewards) for reading. Will it<BR>make reading less desirable? What happens when parents give their<br />children dessert as a reward for eating their Brussel Sprouts?<BR>(One experimenter did try to rewards students with Brussel<BR>Rewards when they ate their cake, but the children didn't fall<BR>for that one!) <br />The same phenomenon occurs in the workplace. Employees who are in<BR>merit pay programs often indicate that their interest in the work<BR>they do drops off, and indeed the quality often falls off after a<BR>few months of the merit pay program.<br />So what's the solution? Ah, here is the weakness, as Kohn himself<br />admits. If the high school were to tell our students that we<BR>wanted the joy of learning to be their reward, I fear the vast<BR>majority would quickly find other joys instead! The enthusiasm<BR>that kindergarten children often exude (\\"Guess what we learned<BR>today!\\") gets lost somewhere along the way. We can't simply drop<BR>our reward/punishment schemes without carefully considering how<BR>we will restructure our homes, schools, and jobs.<br />This is a book that parents, teachers, and employers will all<BR>find interesting. It should cause some interesting debates.	2002-06-09

This is a<BR>man who would betray his friends at the drop of a<BR>hat, provided that the betrayal it was useful, a<BR>man who invented the \\"love them and leave them\\"<BR>philosophy, a man who will say or do anything to<BR>escape with his own hide.<br />But he is also a man who is destined to be where<BR>the action is - so in his various adventures, he<BR>meets Abraham Lincoln, is involved in the famous<BR>charge of the light brigade, becomes friends (of a<BR>sort) with Bismarck. But through his eyes, we see<BR>history just a bit different.<br />There are seven volumes so far in George Frasier's<BR>series, but the one I think you'll enjoy best is<BR>Flashman and the Redskins. Set in the old West,<BR>the novel tells of Flashman's encounters with men<BR>like Will Bill Hickock, Geronomo, Kit Carson,<BR>Crazy Horse, and George Custer. The culmination of<BR>his adventures is the most famous of the Western<BR>battles - Custer's defeat at the Little Big Horn.<br />But Flashman doesn't spend all his time fighting<BR>Indians. He would much rather be in the arms of a<BR>beautiful woman. And he succeeds in this endeavor,<BR>not once, but several times during the course of<BR>the novel. First, we meet Susie, the madam of a<BR>brothel he happens to encounter on his way west.<BR>Of course, he can't remain faithful to her for<BR>long, not with all those other women (the \\"sluts\\"<BR>as he calls them) that are so available. Finally<BR>he must abandon his new \\"family\\" to continue his<BR>journey, but that doesn't end his womanizing. When<BR>he is captured by the Apaches, he saves his life<BR>by seducing the chief's daughter! And we don't<BR>want to miss the mysterious Mrs. Candy who takes<BR>him on his last journey west.<br />But the joy of this book is not just the marvelous<BR>adventures Flashman has, nor is it the great character Fraser <BR>has created (a man you love to hate). This is a book where the <BR>language is equal to the story. As Flashman describes his near <BR>brushes with death, we can feel his fear, fear that he is able <BR>to cover up when others are around. <br />This is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, but<BR>you'd best hold on tight, or you'll fall off laughing. <br />(NOTE: Since one of Flashman's characteristics is his amorous<BR>nature, there are several rather ribald passages. They are not<BR>pornographic or vulgar, but they are suggestive. I found them<BR>quite funny, but if they bother you, just skip a few paragraphs<BR>and you'll be in safe territory again.)	2002-06-09

This week I found<BR>an author I hadn't read before, and the good news<BR>is that she has written many more books about the<BR>same character!<br />In \\"A\\" is for Alibi, Sue Grafton writes of Kinsey<BR>Millhone, a private detective who lives in<BR>California in a small, plain apartment with no<BR>house plants or pet - she wants to leave her<BR>house, like her life, uncluttered. When Nikki Fife<BR>enters her office, though, complications walk in<BR>as well.<br />Eight years before the start of the novel, Nikki's<BR>husband, Laurence, had been murdered; someone had<BR>slipped poison into his allergy pills. He had<BR>plenty of enemies, both domestic and business, but<BR>only his wife seemed to have the opportunity.<BR>Since she had kept a diary detailing her husband's<BR>many extra-marital affairs, it seemed only logical<BR>to convict her. <br />Now she is out of jail, and she wants Kinsey to<BR>find out who really killed Lawrence. As Kinsey<BR>begins her investigations, she discovers that<BR>Elizabeth Glass, who was apparently Lawrence's<BR>last lover, had been killed only two or three<BR>weeks after Lawrence - and by the same method!<BR>Nikki had not been charged with the crime, but the<BR>detective who had been in charge felt sure she was<BR>guilty of both murders. Her instincts tell Kinsey<BR>that Nikki is innocent, but can she prove it?<br />Soon she is on the trail. She interviews<BR>Lawrence's first wife, Gwen, and discovers that<BR>his affairs had been going on for many years. In<BR>fact, Nikki had been one of his lovers while he<BR>was still married to Gwen. She meets Charlie<BR>Scorsoni, Lawrence's former law partner and his<BR>best friend, and soon becomes entangled in a<BR>romantic relationship of her own - totally against<BR>her own rules, but she can't seem to help herself.<br />Over the next couple of weeks, she interviews<BR>Lawrence's three children, two by Gwen and one by<br />Nikki. She meets Elizabeth's mother and her ex-<BR>boyfriend. She visits Charlotte Mercer, one of<BR>Lawrene's lovers (and the wife of a promiment<BR>judge). And she tries to interview Sharon Napier,<BR>who had served as Lawrence's secretary, but<BR>someone killed her first, apparently to keep<BR>Sharon from telling what she knew.<br />The list of suspects grows as Kinsey's life gets<BR>more complicated. The more she learns, in fact,<BR>the more twists she discovers in the story. Of<BR>course, she does finally put all the clues<BR>together (and a careful reader can, too; Grafton<BR>plays fair with us). But then she has to fight for<BR>her own life, for what she has learned is too<BR>dangerous for Kinsey to live.<br />If you like detective stories, you'll love this<BR>series. The characters are well done, the plot has<BR>enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes,<BR>and the action scenes will get your blood rushing.<BR>I look forward to the next book.<br />(Reader's Advisory: There is some use of strong<BR>language in the book, though  it didn't get in my<BR>way and was in character.)	2002-06-01
US	53043205	RF83R1J5GDVZ7	0684801051	607441444	Time and Again	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Visit a simplier time!	Have you ever wished you could go back and live in a<BR>simpler time, a time when the pace of life was slower? You<BR>might have to give up our modern transportation system, you<BR>might have no television or telephones, and you might have<BR>to live without a computer -- but your life would be much<BR>less complicated.<br /> In Time And Again, Jack Finney tells the story of Simon<BR>Morley, a man who is able to fulfill this dream, to go back<BR>in time -- specifically to the year 1882. Unlike most time<BR>travel novels, however, this one involves no time machine;<BR>there is no use of hidden dimensions or holes in time.<BR>Instead, time travel involves the inner self, our ability to<BR>visualize a new reality.<br /> Simon was a magazine illustrator who was approached by<BR>a secret United State governmental project. Would he be<BR>interested in joining them? The agent who contacted him<BR>could not say what the project was, just that it was the<BR>most exciting opportunity in the history of humanity. If<br />Simon was interested, he could be tested, and if he passed<BR>the tests, he would be told more and invited to join.<br /> Needless to say (otherwise there would be no story),<BR>Simon was interested, he took the tests (some right<BR>interesting ones, too), and he did pass. Then he learned the<BR>secret. Dr. E. E. Danziger had theorized that if a person<BR>believed -- totally and completely -- that he was living at<BR>a particular time, he would in fact travel back to that<BR>time. And Simon, because he was such an inner-directed<BR>person who would stick to what he believed and because he<BR>was a man who could be totally hypnotized, was a perfect<BR>subject for the experiment.<br /> Simon agreed to participate, partly because of a<BR>private mystery of his own, a letter that he wanted to trace<BR>back to its origin in the late 1890's. As a result, he moved<BR>into an apartment building in a part of town that had<BR>changed very little since the turn of the century and began<BR>to immerse himself in the past. He read the newspapers of<BR>the period, he dressed in the period, and those who came to<BR>visit dressed and acted like their nineteenth century<BR>counterparts. <br /> And one morning it worked! He left the building to find<BR>himself in the same apartment building on the same street in<BR>New York, but in the year 1882. And thus began his<BR>adventures.<br /> I will say no more about the plot, less I give away too<BR>much. The story is fascinating, both in terms of the science<BR>fiction element of time travel and in terms of the mystery<BR>that Simon has to solve while there. The highlight of the<BR>book for me, however, was the detailed description of the<BR>time to which he had traveled. If Dr. Danziger's theory were<BR>true, many of Finney's readers would have disappeared long ago,<BR>for he gives such a graphic picture of the period that I felt <BR>almost as if I were there myself, as if the events of the novel<BR>were not fiction, but reality.<br /> Likewise his characterization is well done. These are not<BR>one-sided characters. There are villains, but we learn quickly<BR>that they have a human side, that sometimes there are reasons for<BR>their actions that are not apparent on the surface, and the good<BR>guys have their faults, too. The writing style is also enjoyable,<BR>especially the dialog of the 1890's, which captures the flavor of<BR>the period.<br /> No, I don't want to give up the convenience of modern<BR>society (certainly not my computer!), but I must admit that at<BR>times, Finney almost had be convinced that life then really was<BR>better!	2002-05-11

Have you ever fantasized about the possibility of<BR>becoming president of the United States? Have you felt you<BR>could do the job at least as well as the folks who have held<BR>it in the past few decades, if not better? Perhaps you have<BR>wondered what day-to-day life must be like in the White<BR>House. It looks pretty plush, but what would it be like to<BR>actually live there? Or perhaps you wander what the secret<BR>service folks are really like?<br /> If the answer to any of these questions is yes, you are<BR>going to love Executive Orders. The novel begins where Debt<BR>of Honor left off, and Jack Ryan (through a series of events<BR>I won't reveal, since some of you may not have read the<BR>previous book yet) is now President. And as always, he faces<BR>a bowl full of crises, enough to destroy most men.<br /> Let's see. He has to deal with a new Arab country, the<BR>United Islam Republic, created when Iran's latest leader<BR>arranges for the assassination of Sudam Hussein and takes<BR>over that country. China's leaders also start things going<BR>when they provoke a dogfight with some of Taiwan's fighter<BR>planes and shoot down a civilian airliner in the process.<BR>Then Ed Kealty, the model of a corrupt politician, tries to<BR>question Ryan's authority as president, and begins to leak<BR>some of the secret missions in which  Ryan had participated<BR>while in the CIA (and which Clancy wrote about in earlier<BR>books). Appealing to our fears about biological warfare, a<BR>few new cases of Ebola, the most deadly modern virus,<BR>suddenly spread to our own country. And to keep his<BR>attention sharp, there are assassination attempts on both<BR>himself and his family.<br /> As always, Clancy jumps from scene to scene, perhaps<BR>more than ever. It is well done, however, and helps to build<BR>suspense. Thus the events which make up one sub-plot may<BR>extend for several hundred pages. <br /> Interestingly enough, this book has not gotten good<BR>reviews from manyof Clancy's readers. They argue that it<br />contains a lot of irrelevant material, particularly in his<BR>political exposition. Admittedly he does push his particular<BR>philosophy; there is no hidden agenda, however, for he<BR>dedicates the book to Ronald Reagan, (the man who won the<BR>war) and many of his ideas are similar to Reagan's and his<BR>followers. I felt, however, that this was an important part<BR>of the book, for Ryan is not a professional politician, and<BR>a main thrust of the novel is his attempt to bring common<BR>sense to the problems that face our nation. I might not<BR>always agree with his solutions, but they were quite<BR>consistent with his character. <br /> It is also fun to wonder What if . . . He wants to<BR>simplify the tax code, for example, by doing away with all<BR>tax exemptions and using a flat percentage tax that would<BR>apply to all income levels. This, President Ryan argues,<BR>would bring in just as much income from the rich folks who<BR>now use the complexity of the current code to exempt much of<BR>their income. It would also have the side affect of doing<BR>away with many of the accountants and attorneys who<BR>specialize in tax law (a benefit that I suspect some of our<BR>accountants and attorneys might not see).<br /> I recommend this book, though I also suggest you read<BR>Debt of Honor first to get the background. It's one of those<BR>thrillers that will keep you from getting any work done!	2002-05-11

We know he is too good to be true, of course, but<BR>it is still fun to read about him. That is the kind of<BR>character Clive Cussler has created in Dirk Pitt, the hero<BR>of 13 different books!<br /> In this adventure, Shock Wave, Pitt comes across a<BR>villain who is an evil as Pitt is good, a billionaire. <br />Shock Wave, like the other Dirk Pitt novels, is good<BR>old-fashioned escape reading. Cussler's characters are all<BR>pretty predictable and one-sided, and there are no deep<BR>meanings to explore. But the plots are quite well done, and<BR>the writing, though a bit bombastic, is fun to read. If you<BR>have read others in the series, you will certainly enjoy<BR>this one. And if this is your first, there are plenty of<BR>other titles in the series.	2002-05-04
US	53043205	R2B0SE33BV9EL8	0140437428	596871917	The Old Curiosity Shop (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	42	48	N	N	Dickens characters still work, but don't be in a hurry!	The only pleasure greater than discovering a new book<BR>is rediscovering an old friend you haven't read for a while.<BR>Many years ago I read all of Charles Dickens novels, but I<BR>recently had occasion to re-read The Old Curiosity Shop, and<BR>it is just as good as I remembered it the first time.<br /> The story, like most of his plots, depends a great deal<BR>on coincidences, so you have to suspend your scepticism to<BR>enjoy it. Dickens begins by introducing us to one of the<BR>most innocent little girls in literature, Little Nell, and<BR>to her most unhappy grand-father. Quickly we discover that<BR>instead of the old man taking care of the child, she is the<BR>one responsible. We then meet one of Dickens' great villains<BR>- the evil, corrupt, mean, and nasty Quilp - a man, if that<BR>term can be used, who has absolutely no redeeming qualities,<BR>one who finds pleasure in inflicting pain on all he meets. <br /> Thinking that the old man has secret riches, Quilp<BR>advances him money to support his gambling habit.<BR>Unfortunately Nell's grandfather never wins, and the debt<BR>grows ever larger. Finally Quilp forecloses on the curiosity<BR>shop that the old man owns (thus the name of the book) and<BR>tries to keep the two captive in order to discover the money<BR>that he still believes is hidden somewhere. While the<BR>household is asleep, however, Nell and her grandfather<BR>escape and begin wandering across England in a search for<BR>sanctuary.<br /> On that journey, Dickens introduces us to a series of<BR>minor characters who either befriend or try to take<BR>advantage of our heroine. He's in no hurry to continue the<BR>main story, so just sit back and enjoy the vivid<BR>characterizations that are typical of any good Dickens<BR>novel.<br /> In the meantime, we follow the adventures of young Kit,<BR>a boy who was one of Nell's best friends until Quilp turned<BR>her grandfather against him. Here we find one of Dickens'<BR>favorite sub-plots, the poor but honest boy who supports his<BR>widowed mother and younger brother. Thanks to his honesty,<BR>Kit finds a good position, but then evil Quilp enters the<BR>picture and has him arrested as a thief!<br /> Of course, we have the kind and mysterious elderly<BR>gentlemen who take an interest in Kit and Nell for reasons<BR>that we don't fully understand until the end of the book. We<BR>are certain, however, that they will help ensure that<BR>justice prevails in the end.<br /> This is not a book for those in a hurry. Dickens tells<BR>his stories in a meandering fashion, and the stops along the<BR>way are just as important for your enjoyment as the journey itself. That can be frustrating at time, especially as you enter the second half and are anxious to see how things turn out. I try never to cheat by reading the end of a book before I finish, but it is tempting with Dickens. At times I wanted to tell him, \\"I don't want to meet anyone else; tell me what happens to Nell and Kit!\\" But I know the side journeys will prove rewarding, so I just have to be patient. Anyway, I am in better shape than his first readers; he wrote in weekly installments, so<BR>they had to wait!<br /> If you have and enjoyed other Dickens' novels, you will enjoy this one as well. If this is your first time (or perhaps the first time since you were in high school), you are in for a treat.	2002-05-04

What is it like after death? Are there pearly gates? A great big library with the<BR>most modern of computers to play with? And will I recognize my students?<br />I recently came across a fascinating book that describes a near-death experience by a man who<BR>lives in South Carolina. In Saved by the Light, Dannion Brinkley tells of an experience he had<BR>back in 1975. Talking on the telephone, he was struck by a powerful bolt of lightening and<BR>found himself floating above his body watching his family try to perform CPR and then<BR>watching himself being loaded into an ambulance. While the ambulance was on the way to the<BR>hospital, Brinkley saw a dark tunnel with a bright light at the other end.<br />Quickly he entered the tunnel and came out at the other end to be greeted by a great being of<BR>light. The one emotion he felt was love, that \\"no one could love me better, no one could have<BR>more empathy, sympathy, encouragement, and nonjudgmental compassion for me than this<BR>Being.\\" As the light engulfed him, Brinkley began to experience his entire life, but this time,<BR>he saw his actions not just through his eyes but through the feelings of the people he influence,<br />both direct and indirect. He could feel the pain of those he hurt, including in many cases the<BR>pain that their families felt as a result of what he did, and he could feel the pleasure of those he<BR>had helped. Unfortunately, his life had not been particularly loving up until that point, so the<BR>pain far outweighed the pleasure. When the review was over, he felt cleansed; his guilt was<BR>removed, even though he still realized the kind of life he had lived. <br />So far, this experience is similar to many others that Raymond Moody has described in his<BR>own book Life After Life. But now things get really strange. Brinkley encountered 13 different<BR>beings of light who poured knowledge into him. Suddenly he knew many of the future events<BR>that would later shape our world - the Gulf War, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the<BR>Chernobyl disaster among those. He even knew the years when these events would take place.<BR>Then he was told that his life was not over, that he was going to return to this life to show love<BR>where previously he had shown hate. He awakened on a stretcher that was being rolled toward<BR>the morgue! The doctors had pronounced him dead.<br />After his physical recovery, most folks moved quickly away from a man who seemed on the<BR>brink of a mental breakdown. It was only Raymond Moody who would listen to him, since he<BR>had heard similar stories. In an initial series of interviews in the late 1970's, he told Moody of<BR>the visions over 15 years before the events in question. (And in a prelude to the book, Moody<BR>supports that claim.)<br />Did Brinkley actually experience life after death? I wish I could say for sure, but he certainly<BR>tells a fascinating story that held my interest!	2002-04-20
US	53043205	RG9CTVWM9XLH6	0399127216	16208543	The White Plague	Books	3	5	7	N	N	A fascinating premiss, but a bit flawed in the telling	John O'Neill, his wife, and his two children were visiting Dublin, Ireland. While John was<BR>taking care of business in a local bank, his family was to visit the sights and then meet him at<BR>the bank for lunch. <br />As the manager was processing his request, John lifted the heavy curtains in the office and saw<BR>Mary and the girls crossing the street. \\"Right on time,\\" he thought as he dropped the curtains,<BR>planning out the rest of the day. After lunch, they would head to Trinity College so John could<BR>complete the research that had brought him to Ireland. Suddenly his world was destroyed in a<BR>sudden explosion. A local terrorist group had planted a car bomb to protest the government's<BR>failure to listen to their demands, and an innocent American family were simply in the wrong<BR>place at the wrong time.<br />Unfortunately John O'Neill was a molecular biologist on the cutting edge of genetics. When he<BR>swore his revenge, the result was a plague unlike any ever seen before. Originating in Ireland,<BR>Britain, and Libya, it soon spread to most of the world, killing half of the population wherever<BR>it went. That's bad enough, but making matters worse was the half it selected: Every woman<BR>who was infected died within a matter of hours; the men were carriers but never got sick.<br />Then came the demands. Unless all Irish, Britains, and Libyans were sent back to their home<BR>countries, additional plagues would be released. The three countries were to be isolated, and<BR>no attempt was to be made to sterilize those areas.<br />You can imagine the results. Areas outside the three countries which were infected were<BR>\\"purified\\" by those outside either by fire or by nuclear destruction. Researchers also began<BR>looking for a cure, for unless some way could be found to stop the plague, the human race was<BR>doomed to extinction. <br />The premise behind Frank Herbert's The White Plague is fascinating, but it has some<BR>significant flaws. Had Herbert given us a good terrorism novel, focusing on the search for a<BR>cure before it was too late, he would have a winner. But he wants to make this a \\"serious\\"<BR>book and just throws in too many different ideas. The debate over the role of women in this<BR>new society is certainly legitimate (and interesting), but I really didn't care about his views on<BR>Irish history and why the country has had so many problems over the past thousand years. Nor<BR>was I interested in why the Catholic Church and its priests were or were not to blame for those<br />problems.<br />I was also irritated by his tendency (shared by all too many modern writers) to switch the point<BR>of view from chapter to chapter. We move from seeing events through O'Neill's perspective to<BR>seeing what's going on in Washington to the manipulations in England to the Pope who is<BR>traveling through America (I never did figure out what that had to do with the story).<br />I was intrigued enough by his story, however, to wade through the more peripheral aspects of<BR>the book. And I must admit that the ending was quite well done; it surprised me, though in<BR>retrospect it was quite logical. This isn't a perfect book, but I think it's worth the struggle.	2002-04-20

As the<BR>film closed, the audience saw many of the survivors and their families  as they gathered at<BR>Oskar Schindlers grave to pay homage to this Righteous Gentile.<br />Like many others in the audience, I wondered what had happened to those men and women<BR>after the war and the experiences that had not made the movie. Now I know. In Schindlers<BR>Legacy, Elinor Brecher has shared the fascinatingand horriblestories of over 40 of those<BR>who eventually came to live in America.<br />They tell, for example, of the almost random nature of their survival. Several tell of times<BR>when the German guards lined up their work detail and shot every fifth person. Many were<BR>away from home on some kind of errand when the Gestapo came and took away the rest of<BR>their family. We read of Celena Karp who was selected by the notorious Josef Menegle for the<BR>line heading to the gas chambers. For some reason, he decided to remove some from the<BR>doomed line. When Celena reached him the second time, she begged him, Let me go, and<BR>for some inexplicable reason, he did!<br />In these accounts, we learn again of the horror of the concentration camps. Remember the boy<BR>who survived several searches by hiding in the filth of the latrine? This was no product of the<BR>writers imagination; Roman Ferber tells his own story in his own words. Others relate the<BR>beatings they survived, the rides in unheated and unventilated cattle cars, of the friends they<BR>carried to the ovens. That they survived is nothing less than a miracle.<br />These arent just the stories of the camps, however. We learn more about the people and the<BR>lives they lived before the warthe young couple who married only days before their arrest,<BR>the woman who had to give her new-born sonto a Catholic family in order to survive herself,<BR>and the men and women who watched in horror as their parents and their brothers and sister<BR>were dragged away or shot before their eyes.<br />After these experiences, what kinds of people did they turn out to be? Some have never<BR>forgiven the German people for what happened, while others have miraculously put the past<BR>behind them. And some are so traumatized that they have never been able to watch the film<BR>based on their experiences.<br />This is a book that needs to be read!	2002-04-13

Finally a worker in that auto<BR>plant fails to follow quality-control checks carefully. The result-an accident that costs the lives<BR>of a family of four.<br />And that is just the excuse a congressman needs to start a trade war with Japan in order to win<br />re-election. When that is combined with a clever computer attack on the stock market designed<BR>to bring out a collapse far worse than the Great Depression, the trade war soon escalates into<BR>military action that has eerie parallels with the beginning of World War II.<br />But this time, it is Japan that has nuclear weapons, for the United States has just destroyed its<BR>last missile as part of a treaty with Russia. The invasion of US territories in the Pacific is<BR>peaceful enough, but it can only be seen as the first step in a careful plan. Unfortunately Japan's<BR>political leaders are not in charge this time (nor, to change the historical parallel, are the<BR>military.) Instead, the one  in charge is a businessman with the philosophy that what is good for<BR>him is good for Japan.<br />This is certainly a situation that calls for a hero, and Jack Ryan is up to the occasion. In Debt of<BR>Honor, Tom Clancy takes his character into the middle of the government in his new post as<BR>National Security Advisor, where he can be involved in every area.<br />Those who have read Clancy's other books will be familiar with his emphasis on technology, but<BR>this time he has involved Wall Street, too, and tries to help us understand that enormously<BR>complex institution. These readers will also recognize the way Clancy brings together a<BR>multitude of different stories into a coherent thread, though it does seem to take him a bit longer<BR>than it did in previous works.<br />This is pure escapism, and the further I read the more engaged I became. I spent several days<BR>getting started, but I swallowed the last three hundred pages as quickly as I could, letting my<BR>other responsibilities slide until I finished.<br />One warning: The ending of the book is quite surprising, and it leaves a lot of loose threads.<BR>Luckily Clancy's next book is already in print.	2002-04-06

Must be able to travel at a moment's notice, able to endure pain and danger,<BR>and willing to lie to your neighbors about where you have been.\\"<br />If you came across such an ad, what would you do? Most of us would call the editor for running such an<BR>obvious hoax, but Emily Pollifax, a garden-club grandmother, once came across an ad much like that one and began a<BR>series of adventures that I have found fascinating reading.<br />In Mrs. Pollifax and the Golden Triangle,, Dorothy Gilman takes us (and her heroine) to Thailand where she<BR>is to simply deliver a package to one of the CIA's couriers. Afterwards, she and her new husband can enjoy a much-<BR>deserved vacation.<br />Of course nothing goes as smoothly as it should, and when Mrs. Pollifax attempts to make the delivery she<BR>discovers that the agent is unable to keep their appointment for an excellent reason-he has been murdered! To make<BR>matters even worse, her husband, Cyrus, is kidnaped and only she can follow the trail to rescue him.<br />Unfortunately her only link to her husband and to the dead agent is a man called Bonchoo, and she is not<BR>sure how well she can trust him. He claims that another agent there has been passing along false information to the<BR>CIA and that he had tried to inform the agency of that fact. <br />Swallowing her mistrust, Mrs. Pollifax follows Bonchoo into the jungle. There they come into contact with<BR>one of the local bandit gangs, a group interested in smuggling both guns and opium. Are they connected with her<BR>husband's kidnaping? And even if they are not, does she know too much to live?<br />Matters are only complicated more when she comes across a photojournalist, Mornajay, a man who insists<BR>on getting in her way, and when she meets the Acharya, a reclusive Buddhist holy man.<br />Her superiors in Washington are in terror that Emily Pollifax may be on her last mission. Of course, we<BR>readers have much more confidence in herabilities-and in the joys we will encounter in the other Mrs. Pollifax<BR>books!	2002-04-06

Why do<BR>stepfathers abuse or even kill their stepchildren? One may come<BR>up with theological or moral answers, but for Lyall Watson in<BR>Dark Nature, part of the answer in found in biology. It is for<BR>the same reason that a newly dominant male baboon kills all of<BR>the youngest infants and all those born in the next five months<BR>after he takes over. It is for the same reason that the bull<BR>elephant seal attacks and kills other males. In studying our<BR>biological heritage, we discover our basic evil genetic makeup<BR>and our power to overcome it.<br />In the first part of the book, he studies the animal kingdom to<BR>discover the parallels with human behavior. Human generosity and<BR>selfishness, for example, also have their natural counterparts.<BR>Watson describes a group of young penguins he observed on the<BR>edge of an ice floe. At first the leaders rushed to the water,<BR>but then seemed to have second thoughts. The water was dark, too<BR>dark to see through; could a leopard seal be waiting for a tender<BR>meal? They backed away. The next group rushed to the edge, and<BR>they too backed off. This process continued until those in the<BR>back got impatient and started shoving. At last one penguin fell<BR>in. The others all waited-yep, there was a leopard seal! All<BR>stood quietly as the pup was consumed. After a while, the same<BR>process continued until a second penguin made the second course<BR>for the seal. Again, a third time. The fourth time, however, the<BR>seal had apparently eaten enough, for the new swimmer was not<BR>molested. After a while, the entire group jumped in and swam<BR>happily. Selfish behavior-just like people.<br />But animals can also be unselfish. Vampire bats have a rich diet,<BR>but the blood digests quickly so the bat must feed at least once<BR>every three days. But how can one be sure he will always succeed?<BR>When those who are successful return to the nest, they<BR>regurgitate part of their meal to share with the less fortunate.<BR>The practice has survival value, but it is also a form of<BR>generosity. Thus he says, \\"Being good and being bad are simply<BR>part of being human.\\"<br />In the second part of the book Watson studies more primitive<BR>human societies, ranging from the headhunting Asmati to the<BR>totally nonviolent Samai. Each culture attempts to deal with the<BR>issues previously examined in the animal kingdom, and both have<BR>reached \\"good\\" solutions. He doesn't advocate we become<br />headhunters, but he does feel their solution has worked for that<BR>society.<br />But this does not mean that we are simply slaves to our genes. On<BR>the contrary: Watson feels that we can overcome our baser nature.<BR>He discusses the horrors of the Holocaust and finds the causes in<BR>our humanity; but the solutions are also in our humanity and in<BR>our ability for free action.<br />This is a fascinating book, both for its argument and for its<BR>glimpses of animal and human behavior. It is not light reading,<BR>but if you watch nature programs or wonder why people act the way<BR>they do, I think you will find it enjoyable.	2002-03-23

Would it be appropriate to enclosed<BR>in the wedding invitations that she and her future husband want<BR>to go to Hawaii for their honeymoon and that cash would be<BR>appreciated?<br />What would you do if your child was invited to a friend's<BR>birthday party and the invitation listed the gifts that would be<BR>desired? What if your child couldn't go and his friend's mother<BR>told him to drop by later on to drop off his gift?<br />Stuck so far? Here's an easier one: A colleague at work has a bad<BR>habit of mooching the snacks that you bring for your own use.<BR>Should you send him a note, along with a bag of goodies, telling<BR>him that for his own good you will not share any more?<br />Less you think I'm making these up, all three problems are<BR>covered in Judith Martin's latest book, Miss Manners Rescues<BR>Civilization. We live today in a society that feels etiquette can<BR>be dropped for common sense, a society that laughs at people who<BR>worry which fork to use for their salad. But Miss Manners (her<BR>column appears in a number of newspapers) disagrees.<br />One of the major problems in today's society is rudeness. You see<BR>it on the streets, in the classroom, in the workplace, and even<BR>in the home. Just telling people to show good manners isn't<BR>enough, though; we have to specify what those manners are! And<BR>just telling folks to do what makes them comfortable is an<BR>invitation to disaster.<br />Thus if we remember the specific rule that invitations are sent<BR>to people we want to share our happiness and are not indications<BR>that we expect gifts, we can avoid quite a few headaches. High<BR>school graduates, for example, don't have to worry that an<BR>invitation to a friend will suggest they are asking for presents,<BR>and receiving an invitation from a friend's child does not mean<BR>you have to fork over. It merely means you are being asked to<BR>share in their happiness.<br />You will probably find a number of your own pet peeves here: the<BR>doctor who calls his 65-year-old patient \\"John\\" but who wants to<BR>be called Dr. Jones himself, the nephew who hasn't sent a thank-<BR>you note six months after you mailed a nice gift, and the sales<BR>clerk who ignores you while she finishes her telephone<BR>conversation with a friend.<br />You'll enjoy her examples and may even learn some manners!	2002-03-23

This isn't your<BR>ordinary burglar, however. He is a man who steals only the best:<BR>jewelry, coin collections, works of art and-if it's lying around<BR>in large enough bills-money. But don't worry; he won't bother<BR>most of us. He steals only from the rich, for, \\"the poor, God<BR>love `em, have nothing worth taking.\\"<br />But burglary is only a sideline for Bernie; he also owns a<BR>bookstore, and in there he meets the most interesting people.<BR>Thus one morning he sells a book to Hugh Candlemas, who then asks<BR>him to enter an expensive East Side apartment (after hours, of<BR>course), and \\"borrow\\" a stock portfolio, which the two of them<BR>would then split.<br />Normally Bernie doesn't like partners, but he agrees. But then<BR>events take a rather sinister turn. While he is casing the joint,<BR>he is interrupted by the owner and his girlfriend and is forced<BR>to hide in a closet. When they leave, the portfolio is gone, too.<BR>And when he tries to call Hugh to tell him what had happened, a<BR>stranger answers the phone!<br />Bernie might just chalk it all off as a bad day, but a couple of<BR>weeks later he is approached by detective Ray Kirshmann. It seems<BR>that Mr. Candlemas has turned up dead-and that the police have<BR>found an empty briefcase in the apartment with his prints!<br />Bernie's troubles are just beginning, though. He soon realizes<BR>that he is merely a pawn in an international game, and the stakes<BR>are much greater than the money he had thought to gain. In fact,<BR>if he's not careful, his life may be part of the game.<br />But Lawrence Block's The Burglar Who Thought He Was Bogart is<BR>more than an entertaining mystery. You'll also enjoy the<BR>fascinating characters that popular the novel. In addition to<BR>Bernie himself, you'll meet Max Fiddler, the taxi driver he seems<BR>to encounter with amazing frequency. You'll enjoy knowing Ilona,<BR>the mysterious woman who suddenly shares Bernie's enhancement<BR>with Humphry Bogart, only to disappear one night when he waits<BR>for her at the movies. And, of course, there's Carolyn, the woman<BR>he can confide in, certain that their friendship will never get<BR>too complicated.<br />This book, along with others in the series, is a quick,<BR>entertaining read.	2002-03-17

In McNally's Trial, Lawrence Sanders gives us a different picture.<br />The hero of this series is Archibald McNally, the son of a successful Palm Beach attorney. Archy (as his friends call him) is less than successful himself. He made it through law school, all right, but he was kicked out for streaking naked across the stage during a performance of the New York Philharmonic. His father gave him a office known as \\"Archy's Locker\\" due to its rather small size and now uses him as an unofficial investigator whenever the firm has need of such services.<br />He carries no gun, for he abhors violence. He doesn't spend time outside windows, for he would rather be eating a good meal. But he does have one of the characteristics of detective fiction: He is constantly in the arms of a beautiful woman. Unfortunately, his own true love, Constance Garcia, has an excellent spy network herself, and he always regrets these rather<BR>painful affairs!<br />His involvement in this case begins when beautiful Sunny Fogarty, the financial manager of the Whitcomb Funeral Home, comes by to ask Archy's father to find out why her employer is suddenly making so much money, in particular why they are shipping so many caskets to New York, Boston, and Chicago.<br />To complicate matters, Archy's favorite air headed bum, Binky Watrous wants to help. He knows nothing about detecting, other than it sounds like fun, and he's totally incompetent; but Archy doesn't want to hurt his feelings.<br />As the two investigate, they run into a number of nasty characters, men who just don't fit the upperclass social image of the Whitcombs. How are they involved? Then they discover that Whitcomb's son and daughter-in-law seem to be involved with the gangster types. Luckily Mitzi seems to be infatuated with Binky (though Archy can think of no reason why any woman would find him attractive) and may be a source of information-or is it disinformation?<br />After a few murders Archy has the solution. But will he live long enough to reveal what he has found to his father? And will another innocent person have to die as well?<br />This isn't great literature, but it's a great beach book.	2002-03-17
