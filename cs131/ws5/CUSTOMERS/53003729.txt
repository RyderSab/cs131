As has been shown by Michael Moore and others, there's money to be had in that marketplace. Distortion of reality is usually termed fiction; here it's labeled 'non-fiction', erroneously. <br /> <br />Having demonstrated that he's not stupid--with other, wiser books--he stoops here to staying just inside the \\"lie\\" barrier. He twists, contorts, distorts, and misrepresents, but never quite lies. He takes elements out of context, misrepresents (intentionally or not) actual events, and simply gets demonstrable facts wrong. His source material consists primarily of newspaper and TV reports, laced with three or four solid books on Saudi Arabia and a dozen more by known Saudi-bashers.  <br /> <br />Posner writes this book in order to sell books and, if he can find a sufficiently ill-informed audience, to scare them into seeing a Saudi boogey-man under the bed. <br /> <br />For instance, when speaking of the Saudi government, Posner calls it the \\"Wahhabi government\\", as though religion were the only factor involved in statecraft. He gets a free ride in using \\"Wahhabi\\" as almost a swear word because he can rely on most of his readers not really knowing what that word means, but having a connotation of evil. <br /> <br />He finds lobbying by the Saudis in Washington as somehow reprehensible, but lobbying by Israel--over the same issues--is somehow praiseworthy. Countries--all countries--act in their perceived best interests. <br /> <br />Posner disgraces himself with this one, another step down from his last attempt at fear-mongering, \\"While America Slept.\\" He even repeats factual errors from that screed.	2005-06-01

Schwartz takes a particular form of Islam--Sufism--which is certainly not the mainstream of the religion, and tries to use it as the yardstick by which to measure any other form of Islam. The result, as with most ventures in using the wrong tools, is a poor book.<br /><br />Schwartz actually tells the reader very little about Islam, even his favored interpretation. Instead, he rants about how a strict traditionalist form of the religion must be the heresy. He makes it very clear that he doesn't like Saudis. Perhaps that's why he's never visited the country?<br /><br />But if you don't actually know your enemy, then how do you critize him honestly? Schwartz hasn't figured that part out.<br /><br />The book is worthless.	2004-09-18

I think the book errs in trying too hard to discuss political events and not enough on what the country's really like. It's not at all clear, in fact, that Mr. Ham actually ever visited the country.<br /><br />His political discussions are actually quite dated, even though the book same out only a couple of years ago. Much has changed since 2002, when the Saudis themselves were the victims of terrorist attacks. The country is planning its first nation-wide municipal, elections, for instance. This would come as a major surprise if you were to rely on this book alone.<br /><br />The book's not bad, but it's really for people who know nothing much about the country. There are better books available, particularly Thomas Lippman's \\"Inside the Mirage\\". That book, though longer, is actually easier to read.	2004-09-18

The author, a Lebanese, shows a particularly Levantine distain for the Saudis. He considers them creatures from the sand and thus colors his entire commentary with more venom than really necessary. <br /> <br />Are there corrupt members of the Saudi ruling family? Certainly. Is the family, as a whole, corrupt? No. Many are pious, charitable, open-minded and liberal. <br /> <br />Aburish takes up too much time discussing what amounts to no more than street gossip and not enough on what's really going on.  <br /> <br />He also factually misrepresents the early 20th C. in Saudi Arabia. It was a harsh place with a harsh justice. Feuding tribes slaughtered others; they did not \\"count coup\\" as did American Plains Indians. They fought viciously and were fought against viciously. It wasn't only Abdel Aziz who put his enemies to the sword--members of his own family were similarly treated by both other tribes and the Ottoman Turks. <br /> <br />It's really a pity that many will buy this book expecting to \\"get the goods\\" on the Saudis. What they are getting, instead, is spite expressed by a \\"civilized\\" Arab for his \\"dirty, sandy cousins\\". It's a frequent lament: \\"Oh, how could this uncultured Saudis have the luck to be sitting on all that oil, while we, the cultured elite, have nothing!\\"	2004-09-18

I confess: Richard F Burton is one of my heroes. In part, it's because much of my life has been spent in his traces, from India, through the Middle East, to Baltimore and the Great Plains.<br /><br />He's simply a fabulous story-teller. Whether he's commenting on the sexual proclivities of the people of a region, their food, clothing, culture or religious practices, he's just fascinating.<br /><br />This book really should not be sold separately from the second volume; they go together. That said, this is an excellent introduction to 19th C. Arabia. It's an Arabia that exists only in the minds of traditionalists--foreign or Arab--but it informs so much of how the Arabs see themselves that it's \\"must reading.\\"<br /><br />Burton was in his prime when he wrote this, before his misadventures in searching for the source of the Nile. His observations are acute; his writing clear. Make no mistake, Burton was a member of Victorian English society, even if he could laugh at the barriers of class when out of the country. His insights into Arabia, though, cast a very clear reflection of his upbringing, as well as the new sense of anthropological research he adds to the process.	2004-09-18

It doesn't absolve them of the harshness that often makes up part of their lives, but it doesn't dwell on them either. I find it objective and balanced. <br /> <br />The only real problem with the book is that, as others have noted, it is very out of date. The few pages added to this edition don't really cover the incredible transformations that have happened in the country since Ms. MacKey lived there. It really should have been re-written. <br /> <br />A better, contemporary book is Thomas Lippman's \\"Inside the Mirage\\", current up to 2002. Even that has already been overtaken by political events in some regards, the information is far more applicable to modern Saudi Arabia.	2004-09-18

In his book, he takes a look at a difficult relationship without succumbing to the post-9/11 quest for demons. <br />  <br /> Unlike Baer, who never worked in Saudi Arabia, or Schwartz, who has never even been to Saudi Arabia, Lippman bases his book on first-hand experience with the country and people who have lived there for extended periods. He also takes the time to talk with Saudis, an almost unheard of tact in this day of instant experts. <br />  <br /> The early parts of the book are excellent. His rendition of the history and slowly-built alliances between America and Saudi Arabia are both factually and contextually correct. He might spend a little too much time on the &quot;Cleaver family&quot; nature of ARAMCO housing, but the effect it had on the Saudis working for and with ARAMCO is accurately captured. <br />  <br /> In some ways, this book might have been better had its publication been delayed for a while. More information, rather than allegation, has come out about Saudi cooperation in the war against terror. For instance, contra the Washington Post review, Saudi Arabia did, in fact, begin anti-terror efforts immediately following 9/11, though the efforts were more highly charged after the 5/12 bombings in Riyadh. Too, Saudi efforts against terrorists in the midst continue today.	2004-07-29

The book is non-polemic, but decidedly anti-Moore. They go through his work, from the start at &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; up to (sort-of) &quot;Farenheit 9/11&quot;, which was released while their book was in production. They were astute enough in knowing just what Moore is about, though, to provide a chapter predicting--amazingly accurately--what and how Moore would proceed.<br />If you want to see how Moore bends and twists facts to fit his worldview--integrity or honesty be damned--then this book is worth reading. If you get bruised when your heroes get taken down a notch, then you should probably avoid it. <br />But then, since all conservatives are being told that they have to see F911 in order to understand the left's rage, perhaps the left should be equally required to read this.

He writes very clearly and actively, explaining how several &quot;common sense&quot; or &quot;Creationist&quot; arguments against evolution don't  really hold water.  <br />His section on the evolution of the eye--supposedly  so complex an organ that it could not have evolved--is truly wonderful as  he shows that eyes have been evolved time and again, across  genera.<br />Dawkins and American Stephen Jay Gould have been having a spat  for a number of years.  Dawkins doesn't miss the chance to kick some sand,  but with their differences being so miniscule, one wonders why he  bothers.<br />Dawkins, too, cannot resist taking gratuitous slaps at religion.   He seems to forget that religion and science inspire different realms.  He  raises ire when none is necessary.  Consequently, he makes enemies for  science, which is even less necessary.	2000-06-01

He describes very clearly how medical care in the U.S. is already being rationed--even though we might not call it 'rationing,' or even realize it.  He gives  clear examples of how that process is being taken place; the arguments for  and against it; and a very coherent argument that medical rationing will  continue, and grow, because it is economically inevitable.<br />This book is  important because it tells the reader that rationing will take place--with  or without an informed patient role.  It is up to those who receive medical  care to understand what's at stake to make sure they do play an active part  in the decision-making process.<br />The book is very clearly written, but  more examples, particularly in the latter part of the book, would make is  more readable.	2000-05-22

I think he's more right than wrong and definitely side with him in his arguments with Dawkins.  But this book is timid.  Gould makes his points adequately clearly, showing how NOMA is a reasonable way to deal  with the differences between science and religion.  His examples of  religious thought on matters pertaining to science are apt and well-chosen.   His examples of science encroaching on realms outside its authority,  however, do not suffice.  While he can and does cite specific examples of  encroachment by religion, he limits his specific accusations against  scientists to the period around WWI.  Naming names might not be within  academic guidelines for getting along with the neighbors, but not naming  them leaves readers largely clueless about what he means.  A little more  bravery would not be out of place.<br />Oh... and rather than a 'quaint  genitive tense,' an accusative case works perfectly well....	1999-11-04

He starts his book well, discussing the strange  interactions between real life (RL) and virtual life as experienced on MUDs  and MOOs (VL).  He almost captures your imagination, then loses it all in a  prolix tale of his adventures in masturbation, both real and virtual.  In  part, the book reads like his paeon of love to the (current) woman he has  trouble making a committment to.  In part, it's a waltz through the lives  of people who are not yet ready to engage in real life and instead are  tooling around virtual reality trying to get a grip on, primarily, their  sexuality.  While this book will surely appeal to those who recognize  themselves in it, it's actually rather repellant to those who have been  there, done that, then grew up.	1999-08-19

The family lives in Germany, a few miles from the Polish border. Their town is rife with German soldiers, war is in the air, and life goes on. Bienek is masterful with his characters. They become so real that they come off the page and engage the reader in both their personal sagas and the great tides that are starting to sweep across the continent. Christians, Jews; Poles, Germans; civilians, soldiers; men, women; adults and children... all are here, all are living their complicated personal lives. And the shadow is over the land. This is the first of a four-part series. The other three parts, which follow this one, are all seriously out of print. They need to be reprinted, if not on paper, then electronically. Bienek is a powerful author who pays his reader many times over with a compelling story set in a critical place and time of history.	1999-08-19

It provides two very useful services.  First, it captures the developments in paleontology (and  evolution sciences in general) that have occured over the past ten or so  year.  Secondly, it focuses a bright light on developments in the southern  hemisphere, where an awful lot of the action is now taking place.   The  book starts at the beginning (origins of life) and moves through various  levels of development to human evolution in succint and easy-reading  chapters (though the authors might have done a little more deciphering of  the jawbreaking scientific terms they sprinkle about).   There's an attempt  at humor, but maybe Australian humor is differently evolved than  American... it seems a little too chummy and not terribly funny.   Perhaps  the only serious problem with the book is inadequate illustrations.  While  there is usually one illustration per chapter, they are only moderately  informative.  Many more would be useful, as would be maps.  As the authors  are constantly refering to the breakup of the early southern hemisphere, a  map or two would be very appreciated.   All in all, a terrific book.	1999-08-16

Eugene Debs would be proud of it, but Solomon's rants suggest he's  run his course and can only hope of punditry to pay his future way.

He abhors proscriptive grammar and pronunciation and argues his corner forcefully.   It's a great pleasure to read.    He argues a bit too forcefully, though,  implying motives to 'language conservatives' and those who resist the  'go-with-the-flow' tendencies in education.  He impugns them and belittles  them rather more than necessary, in my opinion.   Where he is strongest,  though, and best able to make his case, is in his discussion of &quot;Black  English&quot; as a dialect of Standard English, no more strange or feeble  than, say, Scots English.  Following this assessment, he argues that  attempts to teach through Black English are misguided at best.  He shows  how, world wide, other countries do not treat dialects of their native  language as flawed, just 'non-standard.'  Nor do they have to modify their  educational system to reach these students, he states.  He also notes how  these dialects have far greater differences from the standard than does  Black English from Standard American English.    Definitely worth reading  and enjoying.  Worth considering, too, the next time discussions of just  what English is come about.	1999-05-19

As a look into the life of a young teenage girl, her family and friends, this is an interesting tale.  As a story that falls between the slats of horror and/or science  fiction/fantasy, though, it leaves a lot to be desired.   The story starts  out compellingly enough; the author gets you interested in her characters  and their quirky lives... sibling rivalry among the eponimous characters is  well done and quite realistic.   When it comes to resolving the mystery  that she's somewhat awkardly developed through the tale, though, Dean  becomes absolutely ham-handed.

The book  got off to a shaky start: it took some 50-or-so pages to realize what he  was trying to do.  The leaden dropping of techno-geek terms seemed  careless.  But as the reader finds the right register--this is not a  serious detective novel--it becomes clear.  If you relax, there's a lot of  fun ahead.

I succumbed to this latest, a rebinding of several earlier books with new information on Archaen geology, because of McPhee's sheer exuberance at the  natural world.    The writing is pure McPhee, with all the quirks and  foibles that he brings to writing.  Some of his metaphors are wonderful;  others seem too strained.  He leaps like a brook, jumping from a comment  about rock (naturally) to one about Mormons or birds or triple-long tractor  trailors.  At times, it's irritating.    The biggest criticism is goes to  the maps, what there is of them... they're poorly printed, in black and  white and (mostly) gray.  They're barely legible and far too few.  This  books calls for an abundance of maps and illustration as McPhee discusses  very complicated issues of geology, tectonics and continental movement.     Still, the book is enjoyable.  All he needs to do, besides republishing it  with another 50-or-so maps, is to print it in a format that you can handle  while driving across I-80!	1999-02-28

And explorer, roue, translator and out-and-out adventurer, he epitomizes Victorian England.<br />This very well done biography challenges several  earlier ones which, according to the author, badly misunderstood Burton and  his milieu.  Clear writing, based on sound scholarship--and new primary  sources--makes this a very enjoyable exploration of Burton and the one  woman who truly captured his heart.	1999-02-05

Walsh may have done a lot of writing, but I sincerely hope it's better than this!<br />E.A. Poe's death--its cause and circumstances--have been a mystery since the day he died. Many theories have been posited, from  the well-known &quot;beat up by election day thugs,&quot; to  &quot;rabies,&quot; to Walsh's &quot;beaten up by the brothers of a woman  whose letters Poe refused to return.&quot;  Maybe, but the case is far from  being made.<br />Walsh provides a lot of background information, not much of  which supports his thesis, unfortunately, but is a good resource for  learning just what has been written about Poe's death.  His writing style,  though, deserves a premature burial.  It alternates turgid with folksy in  an extremely irritating mix.  One gets the sense of great condescention on  his part.  As this is only his latest book on Poe, it may be that he's just  recycling his own, earlier work.  In any event, this is one to avoid.	1999-02-05
