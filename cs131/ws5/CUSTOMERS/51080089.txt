Rafael is also fiercely loyal with a steel will. Unfortunately, they are loyal to two different groups of people on opposite ends of the spectrum and their wills clash every chance they get. Over everything.  <br /> <br />Somehow, we're supposed to believe these two are chosen to be lifemates. For each other. <br /> <br />I love the Carpathian males. They're yummilicious. More than a little dominant. Very alpha. And they all take protecting their mate very seriously.  <br /> <br />Maybe more so than other Carpathians Rafael seemed emotionally stunted. Granted, Colby did not make things easy on him. She seemed to have lost her sense of humour somewhere along the way. And it would seem to me one would need to keep that in order to be a successful lifemate. Especially to someone as bossy as Rafael. I would love to say that the males need a sense of humour too, but they havent had any emotion for a few hundred years, so I'm guessing they long since forgot how to find humour in a situation. <br /> <br />I also questioned.. if Colby's father was the child of a Dragonseeker and her Lifemate, than wouldnt Colby be not really human herself? Kind of like Shea, who's father was Carpathian? Shea knew something was wrong with her her whole life and knew she needed blood regularly. But Colby seems to be very human and very resentful of the changes. <br /> <br />I'm starting to wonder at their \\"dying race\\" business tho. There seem to be an awful lot of them still floating around!! And having twins (now triplets!)Perhaps Mikhail and Raven need to get out of the mountians a little more! <br /> <br />Bottom line, it's a good solid addition to the Dark series and introduces us to new facets of what's going on - although, honestly, I've read every book in the series and I'm still not \\"getting\\" the conspiracy. Will it ever be resolved?? Rafael and Colby however, got on my nerves and I thought they both deserved a smack of good sense!! <br /> <br />	2005-02-07

And, unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with any of the characters in what was promising to be a nice yummy Halloween read. <br /> <br />Dark Hunger - Really, and truly, onlly for die hard Feehan fans. I had considered myself one, but she's been a bit slow in keeping up with the sub plot of the Morrison's and their attempts to kill off all Carpathians. I love the Carpathian males, too, but they've been starting to grate on my nerves a bit. Just how many can be bigger and badder than all the rest? (We've already had Gregori, after all!) And I've been beginning to wonder, thru the last few books, what TIME do these stories take place in? Dark Guardian was definitely \\"current\\". They used email and the world wide web. Are we now going to move into the future? <br /> <br />Awaiting Moonrise - Didnt really do anything for me, honestly. I think it would have been more interesting had Jenny also had the \\"problem\\" and been looking for a cure,  or if her instincts been to protect Samuel and not use him as a guinea pig. But she didnt and her instincts were her career and not her man and so, I wasn't all that thrilled with the heroine. <br /> <br />The Night Owl - Had promise and Holly usually writes with enough sizzle to make up for less than fantastic character development. However, this one left me slightly repulsed and not at all scintilated. <br /> <br />Seduction's Gift - Another promising story. And I do like interesting premises. However, I'm sure that scholars of Arthurian Legend are gritting their teeth. The major drawbacks on this one was too much information on a whole new world in too small a space and really poor character development. I didnt like any of the characters. Not Morgan Le Fey who was willing to let her grandaughter be raped in order to receive her \\"gifting\\", not Lancelot who had \\"gifted\\" so many before Grace. Not even Grace, perpetually stuck between her past and her fears and hatred.  <br /> <br />So,keep your money, buy it used, or borrow it from a friend! Just ask, and I'll even lend you my copy! ;)	2004-11-01

Classic 1970's era romance where the woman is the \\"constant victim\\" and \\"wanted by every man that's ever looked at her\\". At the start of the book, she had been molested/groped/hurt by men on three occasions.  <br /> <br />Were there any other cliches? Of course! The virginal mother figure to her young brother, orphaned by her birth mother, an abusive step father, and a string of mom's boy friend's who couldnt seem to keep their hands or eyes off of mama's little girl. Than, of course, there's the \\"marriage of convenience\\" to the rich Italian man, who just happens to have connections to organized crime, although he makes his money in the legitimate area of the film industry. <br /> <br />This book was just bad. The characters were unemotional,the plot stale with too many cliches and no originality. We are told too much, and shown too little. Over and over again Singh TELLS us how devoted Taylor is to her brother and yet there is hardly any scenes so we can SEE their closeness. Over and over again Singh TELLS us how unsure of himself Jackson is but there are no scenes where we see him acting unsure.  <br /> <br />The only reason I purchased it was i thought the blurb and the cover art were interesting. Unless Singh matures as an author, this will certainly be my last book of hers that i'll read. <br />	2004-09-15

Over and over again, he has been re-assured of his worthlessness, his tainted blood, and his inability to ever be loved.<br />He's more or less accepted his lot in life. He'll marry to ensure that St. George's orphanage continues, but that's it. He'd gladly stay at home with his dragon lore. He plays at being the DragonSlayer, but deep down he knows he's really the dragon.<br />Who Colin doesn't count on is Miss Sarah Banks.<br />At first, Colin refuses to marry Sarah. Not because of her own lack of noble birth, but because he knows that here is a woman he might love. A woman he desires. If his control ever slips, if the dragon ever emerges, it will kill Colin's spirit if he ever hurts her.<br />Due to outside circumstances, Colin realizes that in order to protect her, he will have to marry Sarah.<br />Sarah challenges all of Colin's preconceived notions. Over and over, she proves Colin to be a protective and generous man. He is honest and trustworthy. A gentle man and a gentle lover.<br />Colin continues to hide the secret of his parentage until it's almost too late. Ms O'Reilly avoids the cliche of letting Sarah hear the news third hand. Colin gets the chance to unload his burden to his wife and in doing so, she is able to deflect the worst of his fears. <br />I only had one problem with the storyline. Although I can understand why Colin feels the worthlessness he does, at times, he becomes maudlin and self-pitying. He gets drunk on his wedding night. He refuses to believe that he has anything to offer the world.<br />This lack of confidence undermined Colin as a hero of a story. We're being told throughout the book that Colin is the tainted spawn of his rapist father, but being shown his kind compassionate heart. These two opposites in his characterization annoyed me after a while. How could someone who was a war hero, saved orphans, and had a compassionate heart not have some inkling that he was an okay person?	2002-04-28

Wulfred kills her father,destroys her Villa, and is a rapist and murderer. He hates all things Roman because he was once enslaved in Rome.<br />Melonia watches her father's murderer take charge of her home, she is enslaved, and has to share her home with the \\"unwashed Saxon masses\\".<br />There's even a line where Melonia thinks about her father's  face was fading from her memory to be replaced with Wolfred's face.<br />Can anyone else say Patty Hearst?<br />It really troubles me to give this low of a rating to an author I've grown to love. Between \\"The Holding\\" and \\"The Marriage Bed\\", I was hooked.<br />But \\"To Burn\\" did nothing for me. The conflict in this book is HUGE. Insurmountable. Beyond resolution in this one book. Both characters hate each other. They're on opposite sides of the fence. North vs South. East vs West. Whichever - they are totally opposed to the other's lifestyle, religion, language, and very existence.<br />I've thought of trying to compare this to a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" kind of story, but that didn't work. Romeo may have killed Juliet's cousin, but he didn't do it in cold  blood. The Montague's and the Capulet's may have hated each other for years, but Romeo and Juliet themselves didn't hate each other.<br />So, they hate each other. That's the conflict. Where's the resolution? Neither character grows, accepts, or adapts to the other. She still hates all things Saxon... except Wulfred. He still hates all things Roman... except Melonia.<br />\\"To Burn\\" was not what I had hoped for with Ms. Dain's latest book.	2002-04-21

I thought this book had an interesting premise. The Greek gods are still roaming around, causing mischief and mayhem in the human world.<br />Hugh is a descendent of Hades and Dia is a descendent of Zeus. The back story for \\"The Seeker\\" starts 6 months prior to the start of the book. Three seemingly unrelated things occur. <br />Hugh and Dia meet at a wedding 6 months ago. There was chemistry between them, but neither pursued it. <br />Also six months ago, Hugh lent some of the famed Pendragon Jewels to museam.<br />Dia performed a magic show at the same museam.<br />And Hugh lost his ability to \\"seek\\".<br />Jump ahead six months and you find Dia frantic to locate her sister while trying to avoid being blackmailed by the Greek goddess Demeter. <br />Hugh is suffering from depression over his lost gift while discovering that one of the jewels he had leant out is now a fake.<br />Now, Hugh has to figure out the pattern of the jigsaw puzzle. How did the several different events cause him to lose his ability to seek and have him fall in love?<br />The romance in this one is fun with lots of backstory - at times, i thought some of this backstory was a bit contrived, but all in all, I think it worked well together.<br />Hugh is all that a romance hero should be. He's strong, powerful, and vulnerable. And although I wasn't that crazy about Dia in the beginning of the book, her character becomes fleshed out enough that I began liking her towards the middle of the book. <br />This was my first Kathleen Nance book, but it certainly won't be my last.<br />Enjoy!	2002-03-19

Pampered rich girl is hauled thru the South American jungle to help locate the dad who deserted her and her mother shortly after the Viet Nam war. Her guide? None other than Aloysius Murdock.<br />Raw and gritty, Murdock leads his best friend's daughter thru the jungle of South America to find the friend he has presumed dead for the past 20 years.<br />The only problem is, Catherine is not nearly as spoiled as Murdock had hoped. She's got spunk. She plays it cool under pressure. She's classy.<br />And too rough around the edges Murdock isn't nearly as rough as he believes. Maybe he's secretly yearning for hearth and home, one woman and lots of babies.<br />This makes for a great story with wonderful characters you like and truly want to see happy.<br />Enjoy!	2001-11-29

Lady Rachel is a beauty - a one in a kind beautiful woman.<br />Without bothering to go deeper than her fair skin, the Duke of Westleigh hates her. Through bitter lessons, he has learned that beauty equals faithless.<br />It is in this way that &quot;Midnight Bride&quot; avoids the cliche of the too beautiful heroine.<br />The Duke of Westleigh is cold and imposing. He has his honor and always abides by society's rules.<br />Rachel, however, sees beneath the surface of the Duke's condesention. She realizes he's an insecure man who clings to the rules of society to give his life order and structure.<br />It is in this way, that &quot;Midnight Bride&quot; avoids the cliche of the cooly arrogant duke.<br />Suson takes characters we've seen in dozens of books and makes them different - more alive. Regencies can only have so much variation. They're all set during the same time period. The all deal with the ton and its rules.<br />Through careful writing, she avoids the pratfalls of a Regency era book by adding depth to her characters. Supplying them with interesting back stories. And adding a decent subplot to the novel.<br />This is the first in the &quot;Midnight&quot; series. Although this is a stand - alone book in its own right, in order to solve the entire subplot of the book, I highly recommend reading &quot;Midnight Bandit&quot; and &quot;Midnight Lord&quot;.	2001-11-29

I really love it when characters in books I'm reading trust each other. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't expect Catherine to trust her new husband right away. They are, after all, perfect strangers.<br />But over and over again, Gray proves himself trustworthy. Over and over again, he shows his strength tempered by compassion.

Get married, inherit the money, and help the woman who raised you live for a few more years. Only, in the middle of the plan, the unexpected happens. You find yourself in love.<br />It sounded great on the back of the book. It even sounded great for the first few chapters. And everyone else is right - Jacob is a hero's hero. Strong, competant, rich. He takes in strays, makes them well, and sends them on their way. Strength with compassion.<br />Where I get caught is with Claire. I just didn't like her. She was weak. She ran away from her problems. She married Jacob, a complete stranger, to protect her. She avoided further scandal and sheltered herself away from life.<br />She doesn't come to Jacob as a woman on her own. She's needy. Dependant upon him to protect her (which, by the way, he doesn't do very well). <br />It was a decent read with a good plot. But without being able to identify with the heroine, the book was just flat for me.	2001-11-18

A lady's man, to be sure - but also something more. He fights duels, breaks hearts, and is the bane of his step mother's life.<br />Lady Hester is a rather plain daughter of a family with good connections. And yet, she chooses to be the companion of the Duchess of Barroughby.<br />Hester sees something good in Adrian, something the rest of the ton - and his family - have overlooked in him for years. And in nurturing the Dark Duke, Hester discovers a man not nearly as bad as he thinks. A man made meloncholy by circumstance but with nothing evil inside.<br />This was a good book. And I certainly liked Lady Hester. She was quiet, but not at all meek. I enjoy it when heroines trust their instincts where the hero is concerned. Hester trusted in Adrian's innate goodness and went with it.<br />I had some problems with Adrian. Although Adrian meant well, he enabled his step mother and half brother to live shallow, vapid lives. And, of course, his enabling brought on feelings of sadness and meloncholy within Adrian.<br />It is this very meloncholy - bordering almost upon self pity and depression - that kept this book from getting a 4 star rating from me. I don't mind tormented heros, but there's a line between tormented and getting on with life and tormented and wallowing. Adrian wallowed.<br />I enjoyed reading &quot;The Dark Duke&quot;. It isn't one of my favorite books by Margaret Moore, but it was still satisfying reading.	2001-11-18

What more could you ask for?<br />I wasn't sure I was going to like this one, but once I started reading it, I was unable to put it down.<br />Miss Maitland's wealthy father wants a title for his daughter. So, he gets her engaged to Paul Clement. Only, Paul has little use for the daughter of a wool merchant. So, his friend Stephen Rutledge begins a pen pal relationship with Lorna Maitland. Through the course of their letters, they fall in love with each other. Lorna thinks she's fallen in love with her fiancee. Stephen knows he has fallen in love with his friend's intended bride.<br />The main characters are truly likable. Stephen is a strong man - a leader - without being too strong or too competant. He isn't perfect and doesn't want to be.<br />Lorna is the daugher of a wealthy father. She doesn't take that lightly, but uses her wealth and position to help others.<br />Does it take her a while to figure out that Stephen wrote the letters and not Paul? Yeah - maybe that was dragged on a bit too far. But than again, without the reader's omnipotant knowledge of the events, how long would it take any of us to figure out what had happened?<br />This was a fun, well written book. I highly recommend.	2001-11-18

I like the fact that Emma has a half-breed child from a long ago rape and she keeps her child and lets him know how much he's loved.<br />I like the fact that Emma doesn't whine about things that need to be done - she just does them.<br />I like the fact that Rider is an outcast in both his Shoshoni world and in the white world. It gives him a certain edge, I think.<br />However, there's a lot to not like about this one, too. I would have preferred that Emma not have been raped. Her son could have been written in differently - ie she's raising her sister' son, she thought she loved the man who fathered the boy, etc. Being the child of a rape has got to be hard on a child.Yet, the son says nothing or does nothing about why his skin tone was so much more different than his parents.<br />I disliked the fact that while she was sleeping with Rider, she tried to get the Lt. from the army outpost to propose to her.<br />I disliked the cavalier way Rider went about securing Emma as his bed partner on the wagon trail.<br />I also disliked that absolute flatness of every other character on the wagon trail. As a reader, you didn't care one iota if any of them lived, died, or made it to Oregon or not.<br />This wasn't a bad book and yet, it could have been done so much better. My recommendation?

I assume she's supposed to be \\"fragile\\" and delicate. To me, she just seemed a meek little mouse with not much sense. She brings her London working wardrobe with her to wilds of a Scottish winter. Hello? It's cold in Scotland and Kate really should have known that.<br />Throughout the first part of the book, Kate is overwhelmed by the sheer size of everything. Which made me wonder - how tall was this woman? I barely hit 5' and I've never been intimidated by the size of a stove. Kate feels lost in the bed that she sleeps in and the author makes sure we know that she barely makes a dent in the covers. Again - what is she? A midget? My two year old makes a dent in my King size bed - so what, exactly was Kate's problem?<br />Aside from the issue of Kate's size and her feelings of being overwhelmed, I really didn't like Max much at all. He was doing his duty, taking care of the pregnant ex-girlfriend of a man he really didn't like. But, that was it. Max didn't seem to have any kind of emotional range.<br />Further on in the book, you \\"warm\\" to the characters. But not nearly enough, in my opinion.<br />And the other thing that kept me from enjoying any of this book was the simple fact that - it was incredibly, horribly edited. There were at least a dozen typos that I counted. Now, a few typos written in a free review of a book is one thing. But when you pay (money) for a book - it had better be well edited.<br />Keep your money, or borrow it from a friend.	2001-11-17

That pretty much sums up the story between Kit Weston and Baron Cain.<br />Like Scarlet, the land is the only thing that Kit truly loves. Her father's plantation Risen Glory is Kit's legacy. Unfortunately, that legacy has been stolen from her by her step mother.<br />In shades of Cinderella, Kit's step mother has inherited Risen Glory and upon her death bed wills it to her son from a previous relationship.<br />Kit knows what she must do in order to inherit Risen Glory. She must kill her never before seen step brother, Baron Cain.<br />I have mixed feelings about this book - I neither loved it or hated it. On the one side, it is filled with cliches. Gone with the Wind is obvious. So is Cinderella. My Fair Lady is in there, too.<br />On the other hand, I enjoyed watching Kit grow up. She's so filled with hate and pride that it takes a long time for her to grow up. And she does a lot of mean spirited things in the process. But eventually, she does grow up.<br />Cain is very much the alpha male. Compared to him, all other male characters seem flat and unfinished.<br />Read it if you can - it's certainly a good book, but save your money and buy it used.	2001-11-17

However, he keeps himself emotionally detatched because he know he can't commit to anyone without knowing the details of his life.<br />The heroine is funny and fiesty - determined to know all of Sky's secrets.<br />What kept this book from the full five stars, though, is the holes in logic this book presented. Sky was a teen when he lost his memory. Exactly - what happened to him? Finishing school aside - how did he get his license without having some type of identification? How does he pay taxes without a social security number? How did he apply for credit cards or a bank account with any basic forms of identification? <br />It just bothered me, yet there was no real way in the story to tell of exactly how Sky survived his late teens to become an adult.<br />Either way, if you can suspend logic for a few hours, it is an enjoyable read.	2001-11-02

But it's not going to stay on my keeper shelf, either.	2001-10-28

At times it made your heart clench at the thought of such a lovely man as Jeff Hunter being an unwanted foster child tossed from home to home.<br />The characters were real - well &quot;fleshed out&quot;. Each with a history and a life all their own. As a reader, you understand what motivates each of them - yet as the reader, you're helpless as they hurt each other and you wonder over and over - will these two find true love?<br />Of course, they do - wouldn't be much of a romance novel if there were no happy ending, hmm? But Jeff and Kelly's conflicts were so deep-seated in who they were that their &quot;happy ending&quot; seemed, at times, to be unatainable.<br />This is a great book - one I truly enjoyed reading.	2001-07-30

Like many teenagers, it &quot;spoke to me&quot;.<br />I'm a long way from being a teenager these days, but I've discovered something - teenagers are basically the same. They still swear they're parents don't understand them. They still are amazed at what they perceive as the &quot;phoniness&quot; of the world around them. Holden &quot;speaks&quot; to many people who feel they don't have an important voice in the world.<br />The amazing thing about this book, though, is simply that so many people have read it. More than 1500 reviews are posted here. That is a lot of opinions!<br />So, does it matter if someone thinks this book is terrible or terrific? Personally, I think it's amazing that so many have read, and had an opinion, on such a landmark book.<br />Love it or lump it, people have been discussing Holden Scofield for more than 50 years. He shows no sign of slowing down or growing up.<br />May we still be discussing him in 2051.	2001-07-14

On the back of the book, it has a reading level 2 clearly marked on it. We even bought it from the Scholastic book forms the kids got in second grade.<br />At any rate, this book is good for a variety of ages, which is a definite plus when you have children of different ages. Little ones can help spot the pictures. Older ones can read the story as well as spot the pictures.<br />My family and I did this as a 'group' project. Each child would scan thru the page and try to find all the pictures first. There are 11 pictures, so the week around Halloween, we'd pull the books out and try to find all the pictures. It made the waiting time for Halloween go by and it also let them enjoy Halloween just a bit longer.<br />John Speirs' books are a lot of fun and I highly recommend them!	2001-07-14

When Cal McCall comes back to town with his own sister in tow, Deck knows just how to extract the best revenge.<br />Sister for sister.<br />About the only thing positive I can say about this one is there was lots of steam between Deck and Silver. So much steam, in fact, that I do believe they spend most of the time making your glasses fog and almost none of the time making you fall in love with them.<br />The book is decently written and the dialouge is good. But to tell you the truth, I didn't feel much for the characters. I just hate it when relationships are built on lies!! Deck is purposefully keeping his hatred towards Cal from Silver. grrr.<br />Even though Deck has feelings for Silver, he is intent on throwing the relationship up in Cal's face. Even after Deck is aware that Silver is in love with him - he wants it all! He wants to keep having sex with Silver AND make Cal suffer.<br />Gee.

The romance.<br />Aside from the beautiful horses and the lush countryside, aside from the wonderful dialogue and the interesting secondary characters - we simply want a romance.<br />&quot;Almost Home&quot; delivers it - completely!<br />This was simply a wonderful book. It was a wonderfully realistic romance - the way they meet, the feelings they have for one another, how their emotions become involved.

As readers, we are supposed to identify with the heroine and fall a bit in love with the hero.<br />In &quot;The Sea Sprite&quot;, the heroine got on my nerves and i felt soo sorry for the hero.<br />The heroine is pushy, risks the lives of her crew - she's a sea captain, which is more than a little out of the ordinary - and does nothing but mourne the loss of her &quot;one true love&quot; (cue violins) who is presumed dead after an accident at sea.<br />She meets the hero, and instead of recognizing him - I mean, honestly!! If she loved him that much, why didn't she recognize him??? - she insists that he isn't her lost true love. In fact, she almost feels as if she's being unfaithful to the memory of her lost love.<br />The whole thing kind of bothered me - the female sea captian set in medieval times, the fact that NO ONE recognized the new guy as a scarred version of the old guy. Well, they think it's him - and they go on with this charade of dressing him up, shaving his beard, and trying to make him look more and more like the guy they remember.<br />Which only makes the poor guy feel more and more sad - he doesn't think he is who they think he is - so all the dressing up is re-inforcing the fact that his &quot;sea sprite&quot; doesn't really love him, but the memory of the man she lost.<br />At any rate, I just didn't care for this book. Save your money and borrow it from a friend - or better yet, find a good book and spend your time enjoying it!	2001-07-08

Like many Americans, you think of Indians in the historical context - war paint, horses, and feathers. Do you want to think again? Read Micael Dorris' essay &quot;Indians on the Shelf&quot;.<br />This book challenges any pre-conceived notions. I found it enjoyable as well as humbling.<br />I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to think again - think again about history and the part Native Americans played in it. And the trouble white historians have had when dealing with them. Many of the essays are written by Native Americans about themselves and the trouble history has in addressing their part in it.	2001-07-07

This one was an emotional keeper.<br />Richard Blackthorne is a man tormented - not only by his scarred body but also by the rejection at the hands of his late wife. The absolute fear that Richard has in being rejected by his daughter is so real that you can feel it vibrating off the page.<br />When Richard finds out that his ex-wife has died, he gets custody of his daughter. To smoothe the transition, he hires Laura as a nanny.<br />Laura and Richard never meet face to face in full daylight until well after they've already fallen for each other. They share these conversations where Richard is forever in the shadows, hiding.<br />Laura's unconditional response to Richard reminds him that he is simply a man. No more, no less - but he still lacks the courage to face his daughter. So, he begins to talk to his daughter from the shadows, too. <br />He finally reveals himself to Laura and the words and emotions were poignant and sweet. But he still is afraid of his daughter's rejection - he knows that one could wound beyond all others.<br />Finally, his daughter sees him by accident and handles things by herself.<br />What I loved about this book was how much Richard loved his daughter.  And in the end, Laura didn't &quot;fix&quot; their relationship. It just kinda happened in its own beautiful way.<br />This was definitly a &quot;read it in one night&quot; kind of book, so don't start it too late in the afternoon!	2001-07-07

It makes a great bed time story or a great &quot;snuggle with your kids on a rainy day&quot; book.<br />This can also provide a nice way to discuss nature and preservation with your children.<br />There are lots of interesting things to look at in the illustrations. I read this to a group of school agers and they all enjoyed looking at the pictures and trying to identify all the different animals. We live far away from any desert, so many of these animals were unfamiliar to us.<br />This is a good book and I definitly recommend it.	2001-07-04

I loved the way she tried to strike bargains with Raymond like she was a guttersnipe bargaining for a penny. Too funny.<br />I liked how they came together strangers and, by being honest with each other, they slowly gained each others' trust and built a relationship. This is a kind of &quot;sweet&quot; book, although there are some love scenes. But you really feel for these characters as they get to know each other.<br />This is a definite keeper.	2001-07-04

Genevieve, although not incredibly likable, is consistant. She's a bit of a snob as she expects everything to run in Wales as it would in England. They are two seperate cultures and this is highlighted again and again.<br />Genevieve does try. She organizes everything and makes sure the holding is kept clean and the rushes are changed. She tries to make sure there is warm water for baths. She tries to add all the &quot;women's touch&quot; items to this previous bachelor pit.<br />Dylan is a man caught between what he's used to doing and what his wife thinks he should be doing. He's too friendly towards his people, Genevieve feels. However, you learn that his father was such a brute that Dylan is trying to smooth things over. Dylan is guilty of blurring the distinction between the liege and his people, but believes he has good reason.<br />Ultimately, though, the book falls a bit flat. Genevieve's snobbery, although probably a fairly accurate portrayal for the time, grates on your nerves. Dylan's blase attitude towards Genevieve's efforts makes you want to smack the rascal a few times. How could any man *not* notice the way his house smells?<br />There is no teamwork here - Genevieve and Dylan are constantly at cross purposes - except when they're in bed. This probably bothered me most of all - neither of these characters were willing to bend until the very end of the book. Pride may be important, but it makes for a boring romance novel.<br />If you can find this second hand, feel free to read it. But don't waste your money on this one.	2001-07-04

He did the rodeo thing and now he runs a struggling horse farm. He married Honey, whom he met because her father also worked in the rodeo.<br />Seth is contacted by his Grandmother to come to the family farm to collect his inheritance - he flat out refuses, but Honey agrees.<br />Honey falls in love with Dunleavy Farms. Dunleavy Farms is a wealthy place, filled with wonderful furnishings, loving people, and the best horses.<br />Seth feels that Honey is selling out to the money, but then comes to realize that maybe Honey deserves all that money can buy. So he plans to divorce her, but wants to make sure she gets his portion of Dunleavy Farms.<br />There were many reasons why I just didn't like this book. Money seems to be to motivating force. Money to pay for Seth's medical bills from a broken leg. Money for the best horses. Honey's father is looking for financial hand outs. Grandmother Dunleavy is intent on giving away the inheritance before she dies.<br />It just seemed, to me anyway, that the over riding theme of this book was that - money really can buy you happiness. In the end, Seth gets it all - the legacy Grandma wants to give, his wife, and this horse that will finish all their dreams &quot;Never Done Dreamin'&quot;.<br />The characters didn't inspire any great warmth in me, either. Seth is a little too set in his own ways and is unwilling to even accpet being part of the Dunleavy family. Honey is an enabler - she enables Seth to coast thru his life, she allowes her father to coast thru on his life. She goes after the brass ring (Seth's part of Dunleavy Farms) and doesn't really look back.<br />I didn't really care for this book - not at all. I suggest you save your money and take a pass on this one.	2001-07-04

Usually, Regency books are about powerful, wealthy lords and the women who love them. The women are usually youngish and can include destitute young women, wealthy young women, women who have been unjustly  &quot;ruined&quot;. <br />The premise of &quot;The Proper Wife&quot; is a bit different. Lord Sinjin Sandiford comes home from the war to find that his estate is broke - thru gambling debts his late father has practically bankrupted the estate. He has good lineage, a title, an excellent reputation - and no money. He must find a wealthy woman to marry. In other words, he's a fortune hunter.<br />This bothers him drastically but he's convinced it's the only way to save his estate. So he sets his sites on finding a wealthy merchant's daughter.<br />What he finds is Lady Clarissa Beaumont. Clarissa is a beauty who is currently on her 3rd Season and has yet to find a husband. She's been around London long enough to be a bit jaded - not the usual &quot;young miss&quot; heroine of a Regency.<br />She meets Sinjin and the sparks fly. They spend more than half the book bickering and yelling at each other before things get resolved.<br />I only gave this a two star rating because the characters weren't all that likable. <br />Sinjin hides behind his pride when what he should have been doing is finding out how to save his estate without being reduced to a fortune hunter. He had been advised many times to come home and fix his estates, but he chose to ignore all advice until it was too late.<br />Clarissa just annoyed me to no end. She rides a stallion, which would have been highly uncommon. (I once read an article by a *real* cowboy who challanged the idea of anyone riding a stallion for leisure - stallions were simply too unpredictable and difficult to manage. Since reading that article, I always find it suspect when any character chooses to ride a stallion.) Clarissa is constantly teasing Sinjin, who has problems laughing at himself. She lets herself get &quot;dared&quot; into doing some really stupid things - you know, because she's so independant! I was like - puh leeze, even my two year old would know better than that!<br />I did give the book two stars for its decent premise - a book from the point of view of the fortune hunter. I just wish the characters had been more likable and that the story had been better.<br />My recommendation? Save your money or buy it used.	2001-07-03

There is an appendix of action verbs - very helpful in creating an &quot;active&quot; resume. There is an appendix on cover letters - very nice for folks who aren't sure how to write a cover letter. There is also an appendix of employer responses to the sample resumes - this was helpful because it showed how employers think.<br />I highly recommend this one - it's helped me land more than one job and I've even lent it to friends and family who were job searching - and they all got jobs using the tips outlined in this book.	2001-07-03

Meredith, by her religion, is not allowed to kill. So Davey is chosen as her bodyguard / hired \\"hit man\\". Davey and Meredith go on a jouney, trying to stop Owain from amassing too much power. Their only weapons are Davey's strong right arm and Meredith's spells.<br />Even though Davey is \\"given\\" to her, Meredith is plagued with doubt about him. Much to Davey's frustration, she doesn't really answer any of his questions. She doesn't seem to trust him with her fears and worries about her enemy. She tells him that they can never be lovers - that it would destroy everything Druid.<br />Davey is a fours senses kind of guy - if he can see it, touch it, feel it, and taste it, than he can believe in it. Meredith's very Druidness is therefore very frustrating to him.<br />The problems I had with this book were many. If Meredith isn't allowed to kill, why is she able to order someone killed? If she is truly convinced that Davey was chosen for her, why does she have so many doubts about him? <br />Davey is a great hero - strong, family oriented - willing to do what had to be done. He even accepts that he and Meredith may never be lovers. He's not real happy, but accepts their love as too genuine. If their love can never be consummated, he is okay with that.<br />Meredith, too, is a good character. She's well loved by her people and is willing to risk her own life to save them.<br />In the end, though, I could only give this one 3 stars. I never really felt the chemistry between these two. Meredith just doesn't seem to trust Davey and that bothered me.	2001-07-02

Hawk is a family man in search of a nanny. He's a millionaire. She's living in a house with no electricity and no running water.<br />They find each other and have an instant attraction to each other.<br />Unfortunately, this is where I got lost in the book. <br />There was simply too much narrative going on with very little dialogue between the couple who were supposed to be falling in love with each other. The narrative dragged on and I found myself skipping pages ahead until the next dialogue break. Of course, he was always in front of the computer working, and she was always playing with the children - not a very big window of opportunity to host a growing relationship.<br />In the last three chapters, Aunt Frannie is intoduced. Frannie, Hawk's sister-in-law, desires Hawk and wants to marry him and does everything in her power to get Ella out of the picture. She succeeds, but has a change of heart when she realizes that Hawk is in love with his nanny.<br />The chapters about Aunt Frannie all seemed a little contrived and cliche. She seemed to be filler for a book that didn't quite make it to the preferred length. She served no purpose in the book and, in my opinion, only made the story drag even further.<br />Wyoming Cinderella needed more dialouge and a tighter story - this one dragged on so!!<br />It wasn't a bad book, though. The characters were quite likeable. My recommendation? Save your money and buy it used or borrow from a friend.	2001-07-01

Everyone has a good time.<br />I highly recommend this one - it is a great story about the wacky ways we devise to avoid what we think we fear. BUT, it is also a great way to build memories that will last forever with your children.	2001-06-25

In fact, I read it so often, I wore the book out!<br />I really didn't have much trouble with the names of the bugs.  and to replace the lack of animal sounds, I just &quot;sounded&quot; like a bee, or a cicada, etc when I used that character's &quot;voice&quot;. The joy of a story, aside from the written word, is how it's read, in my opinion.<br />The story is simple and sweet, the artwork is excellent, and all the kids seem to love the ending. What more could you ask to add to your children's book collection?	2001-06-25

Like many siblings, PJ teases Honeybunny. He teases her a lot.<br />For a little boy bunny, teasing is the way he shows his affection towards his sister. Probably not the way most parents would want their children to show affection towards each other, but it is highly accurate.<br />My own sister would tease me mercilessly. But if anyone else tried to tease me? She'd jump to my defense in a heartbeat.<br />This is a story reflecting that reality, not encouraging it. And it's also a nice way for parents to discuss with their children the consequences of teasing....<br />I thought this was a sweet book about the problems with siblings. A good way to open up the lines of communication between siblings.	2001-06-24

That's right - i said a place to *start* your research journey.<br />This is in no way, shape, or form a book that will help you write a paper, pass a history course, or understand some obscure literary reference in a poem.<br />If you read it, however, you may just impress Jay Leno when he does his &quot;Jay Walking&quot; segments on the Tonight Show.<br />For what it is - an all purpose guide to Western / american culture - it does a good job. I've referenced my copy many times over the years. ie When I'm watching a movie set during the life and times of Horatio Nelson, I've looked up Nelson in the book. When I'm reading a book that takes place during the Napoleonic Wars, I've referenced quite a few things.<br />Is this the entire history of Western / American culture? NO. It's a thumbnail sketch with many, many holes.<br />It is however, quite informative and interesting.<br />As long as you understand what it is and what it isn't - I'd recommend the book.	2001-06-24

Princess Elizabeth's world gets destroyed by a dragon - her castle is smashed, her clothes are burned, and her Prince is carried off by a dragon.<br />Does Elizabeth sit back and let the dragon win? Nope.<br />She puts on a paperbag and heads out to rescue her man. She puts her smarts to good use and defeats the dragon. No violence. <br />And for her troubles? Ronald yells at her!! What's a Princess to do? She tells him off an skips off into the sunset.<br />I loved Elizabeth's resoursefulness. I loved how the test of her character showed her that Ronald wasn't the Prince for her. I loved how, instead of weeping over the loss of such an unprincely Prince, she dances off into the sunset.<br />This book is one of my all-time favorite stories.	2001-06-24

They're a little too pushy and I tend not to like them. <br />I mean - what's the big deal? The man is furnishing his home, for cryin' out loud. Why is that newsworthy? The local paper doesn't cover me everytime I buy something at Wal Mart. Sheesh!<br />The West was a place folks in the East went to forget their pasts. Where you could re-invent yourself. I'd have been more suspicious if he wanted to do an interview.<br />And then the things she does say about Donavan? They're too much. She gets nasty and makes all kinds of allegations about what could go on in that big ol' bed. This seemed more &quot;The Enquirer&quot; than the respectable local paper.<br />Especially considering she has a past to &quot;hide&quot;, too.<br />In the end, when he dons his bounty hunter clothes - I thought this was just too silly. Once he wore the clothes he became more dangerous. I understood that he was putting on a mask, a hard calculating mask to bring in a bad guy. But the way everyone in town flinched? That seemed silly to me. A little &quot;too much&quot;.<br />The book does have it's good point, if you can get past the silly premise. There's lots of chemistry, lots of secrets, and lots of good dialogue.<br />But save your money and borrow this one from a friend or get it used.	2001-06-23

And everyone in the town feels that they can come to him with their troubles and thoughts. Their dreams and hopes. And each one sees Singer as a copy of him or herself.<br />No one sees Singer for who he really is.<br />There is only one person who Singer needs. Only one person who sees Singer for who he is. Only one person who understands Singer. Antonapoulos.<br />But Antonapoulos isn't well and is sent to live in an asylum.<br />As each one of the characters come to Singer and sees their reflection in him, each one is a little less lonely. Each heart is a little less burdened.<br />But for Singer, who has no one to understand HIM, he becomes more lonely and more isolated. And finally, when Antonapoulos  dies, Singer realizes that there isn't anyone else in the world who can understand him. Who can listen to him. Who can love him.<br />I thought this book was incredibly sad. All the people were so concerned about having another person listen to them and love them. And I kept thinking - what about spirituality? What about God?<br />It seemed to be the missing link in every character. There was no promise. No future. No hope. Just the doldrums of living everyday without anyone knowing you. Without anyone understanding you. Witout anyone loving you.<br />It was beautifully written, it remains a true American classic. But it made me very sad for all the characters in the book who couldn't seem to see beyond the here and now.	2001-06-23

Rabbit will split the crops with Bear 50/50. All Bear has to do is decide which half - tops or bottoms - he wants.<br />Unfortunately, whether the crop is potatoes, lettuce, corn, or radishes, Bear keeps picking the &quot;wrong half&quot;.<br />This is a hillarious story that kids of all ages will appreciate.

Only, every time Roger finds a dandelion, someone bigger comes and snatches it away from him. Roger has the opportunity at one point to push Tiny Stout out of the way and grab *his* dandelion, but Roger is no bully.<br />Roger wanders off and finds a magical silver dandelion. He picks it, but then the Masked Weasel comes and says, &quot;Your dandelion or your life!&quot; (I've adored that line for over 20 years!!)<br />Roger fends off the Masked Weasel and saves the day.<br />As a child, I used to love dandelions and I could never understand why grown-ups hated them.

She is a down-to-earth woman who has managed to survive in some very brutal times. Cathryn's courage is daunting. She is a woman you want to see happy.<br />Sir William. Ah, well, Sir William is fine, indeed. He is a man who understands that wife and keep are his to protect. And he does just that. His strength and his character makes you fall in love with him.<br />lol - Of course, his &quot;Frankish sensibilities&quot; will allow nothing less.<br />He's incredibly charming with a &quot;naughty&quot; sense of humor...but not sooo naughty that it's insulting. Just enough to make you smile. And you will smile.<br />Their love story is beautiful. They come together strangers. Cathryn accepts him but doesn't trust him.<br />Slowly..oh, so slowly (and with a little help from some friends) they grow to trust one another.<br />And - once they trust one another - their love begins to blossom.<br />Cathryn and William's love story is truly beautiful.

That part I'm okay with. Of course PI Jennifer finds his sister very quickly. The sister is in hospital suffering from injuries received by an auto accident that left her widowed.<br />PI Jennifer is now no longer in the picture.<br />Brother and sister have a wonderful reunion and eventually Rich gets to meet his niece and nephew. Unfortunately, the person taking care of the kids can't take care of them any longer and Rich's sister asks him to step in and take over.<br />Of course, he knows nothing about children, so he calls in PI Jennifer. Who doesn't have any little brothers or sister, no nieces or nephews, no friends with small children. So, like - why, exactly, is he calling her?<br />The romance develops at a pretty predictible rate. They're attracted and they realize how much work taking care of two kids are.<br />Of course, one of the kids gets sick and things get even more stressed out. Their &quot;baby expert&quot; goes into labor. In short, nothing works right for them.<br />There are lots of misunderstandings and lots of things that should be said that aren't.

What I hate, though, are bullies dressed up as big strong alpha types. And that seems to be what I get when I read a Diana Palmer book.<br />First off, John is supposedly an indredibly wealthy man. Their friendship is supposedly strengthened because Madeline has no need for his money. But this is never explained. Her books sell, but she's apparently not a name brand. She drives a 20 year old car. She can apparently pay her own way, but still..that doesn't seem to explain how that rules her out as a gold digger.<br />John is just mean - no other way to put it. You know the type - &quot;I desire you so much that I *have* to be mean to you&quot;. He belittles her fear of men after a bad relationship. He doesn't trust her with his own cousin. Granted, she just doesn't lay back and take it, but her responses are weak.<br />Madeline doesn't thrill me, either. At 27, she goes around with a &quot;sophisticated&quot; facade of a woman who needs no one. She claims to feel trapped by the very idea of marriage and children. But when she gets pregnant, all those feelings simply dissolve without a wimper.<br />It also annoys me to no end in a book when women who are in a relationship with a man makes the deliberate decision to NOT tell him about her pregnancy. To me, is shows that the woman is too weak to substantially stand up to the man and that she doesn't really trust him.<br />I did give it 2 stars because for the most part the dialoug was witty and moved at a decent pace.<br />Alpha men are few and far inbetween..But if you're looking for a prime example of a hot and sexy alpha man - stay away from John.	2001-06-14

No real surprise there! What makes this rendition unique is Mr. Gruffudd's wonderful voice, the book that doubles as a resource, and, of course, the wonderful story of a man more determined to do what was &quot;right&quot; over what was &quot;legal&quot;.<br />Mr. Gruffudd just has a way with British accents. Robin's band of men apparently come from all over the UK - Cornwall, Irish, King's English accents (plus more that I couldn't easily identify) were used. And of course, Mr. Gruffudd's natural Welsh accent told the story.<br />The book was great. Lots of pictures, lot of sidebars of information. From obsolete jargon to modern pictures of people in costume, these pages in the book help to explain a lot.<br />The story, of course, is a classic. I would caution parents of sensitive children to consider editing the last chapter or so. Instead of ending the story with the &quot;happily ever after&quot; once Robin and Marian are married, this book follows Robin until his death at the hand of his cousin, who betrays him. <br />All in all, it was highly enjoyable. A definite recommend!	2001-06-10

Writers spend a lot of time and effort writing them - there should be something to compliment, ya know?<br />Unfortunately, that's not the case with this book.<br />The author has too many very complex issues to get covered in a 55,000 word book. (scars from being orphaned, widowed, anorexia/bulima, a new relationship, and suicide)<br />The hero doesn't trust enough to love anyone. Apparently, not even his own kids. His sister has been raising his kids since the death of his wife..is he thankful?? No. He just wants to know why he wants a life of his own.<br />The other subplot - which could have been very well done - was the fact that his daughter may have developed anorexia/bulimia in a desperate bid for his attention. Does he give her that attention?? No. So she tries to commit suicide. Yeah..that'll teach dad to ignore you, huh?<br />But the book glosses over all the ways this rancher refuses to show his love for anyone - even his kids. He &quot;gets it on&quot; with a no strings attached affair with the new nanny. She doesn't even like him all that much - just thinks he's really &quot;hot&quot;. (This is romance?? sounds like male fantasy fiction to me!)<br />In the end, though, the Nanny &quot;cures&quot; the daughter's anorexia, &quot;cures&quot; her suicidal depression, &quot;cures&quot; the rancher, and everyone lives happily ever after. blech<br />What bothered me the most was how lightly real issues were dealt with. Granted, the romance genre isn't a cure all for the world's readers. But real women do read these books. Will a new honey for dad cure anorexia in a teenage daughter? doubtful. Will a new honey for dad keep his violently depressed daughter from a repeat attempt at suicide? I don't think so. Will dad's new honey teach him to love his own kids?? Why should she have to?? Shouldn't that already a given?<br />I don't know. If anyone liked this book, I'd love to hear why.	2001-04-03

The couple then spends the next 8 chapters not explaining what really happened. They finally explain in Chapter 9 and everyone is happy by Chapter 10. <br />The misunderstanding in this book is a little more complex. The hero is deaf and her father fails to mention that to her. Immediately on the heals of the wedding, they are forced to flea her father's home because an angry, jealous cousin attacks the keep.<br />When Robert realizes Mairi doesn't know he's deaf, it's already too late. He wants the marriage to work, but his honor won't let her make the final commitment to him (consumation) until she knows the truth. But he wants to wait until he's home to tell her the truh. He is equally afraid of her pity and her scorn. He feels that by showing her how he has kept his keep and has the respect of his people will prove to her that he will be a good provider.<br />Without the marriage consummated, she can still back out of the marriage contract. His honor demands nothing less.<br />This story line worked because Robert had very real reasons for keeping his secret. He wanted her told. In fact, it was a stipulation to the marriage contract in the first place. That the misunderstanding occured was not his fault and it was something he wanted to rectify very badly.<br />I liked how the author dealt with a deaf hero. Especially a deaf hero in an unusual time period - Medieval Scotland. She mention a few of the signs he learned and created over the years. She even mentions how he managed to survive without his hearing and became a knight.<br />I liked how his honor was important to him. I liked how Mairi took the news, dealt with it in a clear headed fashion. She was a strong heroine, full of courage and passion.<br />This was a very good book - I highly recommend.	2001-03-13

I've kept my copy and have enjoyed re-reading it many times over the past years.<br />This is the story of a 16 year old girl who finds love with a rear gunner during WWII.  He won't allow himself to trust, to love. He knows he's a dead man walking  and she should have her whole life ahead of him. She's a little self  centered (who isn't at 16?). Through love and patience Kate grows up and  teaches Johnny that his life is worth living and she is worth the risk of  love.<br />This is a beautiful story infused with information about the RAF,  the war, England's war effort.<br />These are star crossed lovers, haunted by  the external forces keeping them apart.<br />If you get a hold of this book,  read, enjoy. Kate's story will become part of you and Johnny's pain will  stir your soul.<br />A definate keeper!	2000-07-15

Widowed from a wife beating jerk.<br />The book starts off with Tessa having very mixed feelings about her baby. She didn't love the father and wonders how she'll love his  baby. Her powerful in laws want the baby, but she refuses th give an  innocent up to the two people who helped mold the wife beating jerk she was  married to. So she goes on the lam and hides out at her ex brother in law's  ranch (he was married to her sister).<br />To protect her from her dead  husband's family, Keefe Walker decides on a marriage of convienence. And  since this is a romance, we all sort of know what happens next.<br />This was  a good book. Tessa was a &quot;weak&quot; heroine. Not an &quot;I can do  anything&quot; person. Just someone who wants a family to take care  of.<br />Keefe is a strong man, a man who will do what is right, no matter  what the cost. He'll protect Tessa and her innocent baby with his name, the  backing of his family, whatever it takes.<br />I liked the book, but then I  like most of Ms. Schulze's books. She writes with a lot of self  depreciating humor about the love between souls meant to be joined.	2000-07-08

Today, we would call it Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. He has nightmares, he feels terrible amounts of guilt, etc. But  he thinks he's going insane.<br />Ella, his beloved, needs him. She loves him  and he pushes her away, not willing to tie her to a madman. But someone  threatens to expose Ella's past and hurt her.<br />Saber decides to marry her,  make her his heir, so when he does finally go completely insane, Ella will  be taken care of.<br />This was a good story, with deeply emotional characters  whose love for each other was tangible and real.<br />The only thing I don't  usually like about Stella Cameron's writing is the way she often *hints* at  what people want to say. I wish she would just have them *say* what is on  their minds.<br />But I did think this was a very good book.	2000-07-08

Morgan just reminded me too much of my brother in law and I couldn't help but spend most of the book wondering if my bro in law was EVER going to meet the girl who could runs rings around HIM!<br />But, anyway, on with the  review . . . Morgan is the town control freak - I mean sheriff. He protects  his own, and just about everybody in town is part of his &quot;own&quot;.  This is definately one over protective mama bear protecting the cubs!<br />And  just when Morgan started to think that he needed a wife to complete things  - WHAM! In walks his new sister in law and its lust at first sight! Morgan  wants her, but knows it probably won't last, so he doesn't want to hurt  anyone and keeps his hormones to himself.<br />Eventually, Morgan realizes he  can't live without Misty. And of course, no one would get hurt if they got  MARRIED! So, there you go.<br />My favorite part of this book was Morgan's  natural acceptance of Misty's pregnancy by another man. The other guy was a  jerk who didn't deserve a family, but Morgan wants what this guy threw  away. I liked the fact that Morgan understood the difference between being  a the sperm doner and a dad.	2000-07-04

Unfortunately, this one doesn't really deliver. Our cynical hero, Chase,  sets out to humiliate our  heroine, Nicole in order to protect his brother &amp; his brother's  marriage. He humiliates her very well and proves himself to be a jerk. . .  a total jerk. Nicole runs too hot &amp; cold to be truly believable -  flirts wildly, dances half naked and then wonders why men get all hot and  bothered. She's also kind of a doormat - she forgives Chase for humiliating  her, hurting her, saying the worst things possible - she should have told  him to take a hike and find a guy who would treat her well!	2000-06-29

The most notable comes from the sheer volitility of the  publishing market - editors rotate, move around, leave jobs, etc. And  writers, using a contact name several months or years old will look foolish  to the people they are trying to impress with their proffesionalism. The  other drawback I found was in incorrect information. For example, they list  president names of RWA chapters. Only the person they listed as my chapter  president hadn't been president for more than three years. In another spot,  they list a phone number for a publisher. I called to have a tip sheet sent  to me. Only, it was an incorrect number.<br />I felt the drawbacks, though,  were merely inherent in the style of book. I would, therefore, still  recommend it to a writer trying to break into the market.	2000-06-25

He survived by dreaming of his love, Alanna. Only when he &quot;returns from the dead&quot;, he discovers the woman he loved enough to live for didn't love  him enough to wait. . . she was &quot;happily married&quot; to her singing  partner. He's filled with bitterness and never tells anyone he's alive.  Alanna is disgusted with herself for her loveless, marriage of convenience.  She discovers Rafe still alive &amp; tries to reconcile with him, but he  rejects her. Alone, despondant, she goes back to her husband.<br />But she's  no longer the girl she was and Jack senses their careers are over and  convinces Alanna to go camping one last time. Admidst a storm, Rafe's  bitterness, Alanna's memory, and Jack's life is washed away.<br />Rafe vows to  set Alanna free by giving her bvack her memories and her life. The fishing  scenes are all metaphores for his dreams for Alanna. She's the elusive  trout, he's the hungry fisherman. Trying to lure her from the depths of her  own fears, trying to convince her that being with him is better than being  anyplace else. His hooks are all barbless - she won't be killed coming to  the surface.<br />The result is a love story that makes me ache for the pain  of two people trying desperately to reach each other through miles of  tangled memories. The allegories make this more poem than prose and I loved  it.	2000-06-24

Okay, I'm not an expert on Native American tales, so I can't tell you how close this story comes to the &quot;original&quot;. What I can say is that I kind of liked Coyote. He sort of reminded me of a ten year old boy. He steals a blanket and gets chased around the desert. At first, he asks for  help from all of his friends. But not even his friends can help himut of  this mess! Finally, he's forced to gives it back. But does he learn his  lesson? No!  The illustrations are excellent, with the eye for detail that  is the hallmark of Janet Stevens. This was a good &quot;mulit  cultural&quot; tool .	2000-05-25

This book picks up with Cameron's two daughters, Rue and Kestrel. When I first read this book 15 years ago, I  loved it! Unfortunately, it hasn't aged well. Nick &amp; Kes are violent  &amp; hit each other fairly often. Kes runs around naked ALL THE TIME &amp;  she uses sex as a weapon against Nick. The second story, Rue &amp; Quin is  better, more gentle, more loving. Even that said, this is the best of the  trilogy.  The other two, The Taming &amp; Ride out the Storm have a lot of  violence between the two lead characters. I wouldn't necessarily reccomend  this book unless you've read the others in the trilogy &amp; want to see  how it all ends.	2000-05-11

They meet under heroic circumstances and Raven assumes her love is compassion, hero worship . . . that she's grateful to him. His own need for her inner strength and beauty  stuns him. Jenna assumes no one can love her so he must simply be lonely.  An &quot;any port in the storm&quot; type need. These two love each other  so much but are too spooked to trust in their love. Their pain is so real,  their love so uncertain that the final outcome brought tears to my eyes.  And even though I re-read this one every year or so, their pain is just as  fresh as the first time I picked up to book.	2000-05-01

I am a 30 year old woman who received this book back in 1987. I just &quot;rediscovered&quot; it this week. As I look back on the entries, I'm surprised at how much I've grown, how much I've learned, how tolerant I've  become &amp; also how I have very much stayed the same. This book guides  you thru some of the bad things that can happen to a woman who doesn't plot  a course for her life. Some of the myths of being a woman are debunked  (can't do math, can't be a trucker, or a construction worker, etc). What I  liked most is that it doesn't push any specific feminist ideaology - just  asking the question - what would you do? The message is clear - don't count  on anyone to &quot;take care of you&quot;. It tries to teach us to take  care of ourselves. It is true that this book (at least my edition) is  geared toward working / middle class teens. But as a middle class teen, it  helped me enormously! This book is great and I look forward to getting it  for both of my daughters!	2000-04-05

Let me tell you with a guy like Zane, I'd be willing to beat him to the ground any way possible. His intensity, his sensuality, his concern for Barrie - this  is the way romance should be written.  Only one thing really bothered me -  we meet him as a baby, learn a little about him as a boy - &amp; then he's  all grown up. For the first 2 books, you feel almost maternal towards him  than WHAM! He turns into this major hottie. But it was definately worth the  mixed feeling. Am seriously looking forward to Chance.	1999-08-26
