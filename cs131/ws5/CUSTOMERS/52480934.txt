The writing is excellent, and lays out the facts in an easy-to-follow, no-nonsense style <br />Bottom line:  you CAN live on the salary that the author received.  If you don't get sick, are willing to work two jobs, and allow no time for a personal life.   <br />I was given this book by a European, contingent on my passing it along to someone it might educate.  I'm giving \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" to a friend whose daughter is goofing off in school.  I don't know if, by the time she's out of school, there will even BE jobs... but she needs to know that, without an education that can help her to find a better paying job, she's going to have a miserable existence.  (It won't be a \\"life.\\") <br />This book should be required reading for all students.  Not only should it help to point out that minimum wage is no way to live, but it should also serve to remind everyone to treat wait staff, maids, and retail workers with kindness.  They work darned hard and have nothing to show for it.	2005-10-05

It was just what I needed this weekend. <br />Star is obviously autobiographical in parts.  (As she gets comfortable with her newfound fame, for example, she contacts an animal rights group to see how her fame can help them.)  It's written light, and funny.  Reading this book made me admire Ms. Anderson more, because she is obviously not a bit of prettu fluff, but a clever, multi-faceted woman. <br />I highly recommend STAR.  I gave a copy as a gift, and would do so again.	2004-10-24

Interestingly, he is not even identified by name until halfway through the book:  is this is a creative use of a lack of words to express the protagonist's importance in the grand scheme?  <br />Whatever the reason, this is a beautifully written book.  Even the descriptions of tortures used (both emotional and physical) can keep the reader interested.  There is a great deal of symbolism that would be lost in a review, but that a savvy reader will understand and appreciate.<br />This was a difficult book for me to read, because it was so terribly sad.

Nonetheless, he manages to do a great job telling the story of how he removed his own hand (which I had to gloss over, I must admit) and how he adapted.  He discusses the many different apparatuses available, and which can do each task the best.  He also discusses how important a healthy attitude is when one is adjusting to his or her new lifestyle.<br />I would have liked to see the stories of other voluntary amputees, as well as the bios that Cushman shares of the involuntary amputees.<br />I would strongly recommend this book to occupational therapists and to rehabilitation counselors.  A caveat:  I would not necessarily recommend this book to people who have lost limbs due to accidents.  I mentioned the book to a friend who is not happy about living without one hand and one arm (due to problems in utero) and he was absolutely furious that someone with the opportunity to live with two hands would choose not to.  That was one man's opinion; nonetheless, this may not be the best book for people who have lost a hand against their will.<br />This was a very brave book to write.  There is a large community (and people who live alone, afraid to tell their dreams) of people who do wish to live without a particular limb.  It's not my place to try to determine their motives; however, if they're not hurting anyone without consent, I would wish that they would find support in one another.  BMEbooks has provided a premiere publication that will serve to educate the public.	2003-04-13

Terezin Concentration Camp held, between 1942 and 1944, fifteen thousand children under the age of fifteen years old, for various lengths of time, before the children were carted out to other camps to die.  A few teachers came in with sparse quantities of art supplies, and they used art \\"lessons\\" as a way of offering art therapy.  \\"I Never Saw Another Butterfly\\" is a representation of those surviving pictures, which are now housed at the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC, USA.

I didn't realize until I was well into the book that \\"Everville\\" is a sequel to \\"The Great and Secret Show\\" (which I never finished, much to my chagrin).  <br />The town of Everville houses the gateway between Cosm and Quiddity.  The story jumps from Maeve's journey on the Oregon Trail to the 1990s and the town's current inhabitants.  It takes not only a lot of pages but a skilled writer to keep all the characters (from both \\"The Great and Secret Show\\" and from the Everville township) straight; Barker does an admirable job.<br />Kirk Reinart's cover art ... was what drew me to this book.  I don't remember the last time that happened.<br />What really struck me as I read was the parallel between Everville and some of the conspiracy theories I've recently heard.

As a student who wants to work for agencies to prevent crime on the internet, I wasn't sure how much &quot;Family Law and Practice: The Paralegal's Guide&quot; was going to do for me.  It turned out to be an incredible resource, not only of how the system works, but also of the workings of families in suboptimal conditions.<br />I could have done without the &quot;Figures,&quot; which were mostly illustrations and seldom court forms; but on the whole, the book was well-written and obviously well-researched.<br />This book seems to portray very realistically family breakdown AND how the attorney and paralegal fit in.  If &quot;Family Law and Practice: The Paralegal's Guide&quot; isn't a part of every business school's paralegal program, it should be.  I got a LOT out of the course, and might not have if it hadn't been for the wonderful text.	2003-04-08

He escaped the Rakowitz Labor Camp, and from bunkers in his ghetto apartment.  By the end of the book, the only members of his biological family to survive were Friedman and his three-year old daughter.  The poor man, at one point, had to choose between his daughter and his mother.<br />The story is very well told.  However, I found myself slightly annoyed by the author.  Again and again, he said that \\"miracles\\" saved him, and that Hashem (God) would get him through.  Don't get me wrong; I'm glad he survived.  I could not help but be angry that he felt that God got him through, though - why him, and not the man next to him?  Many books about the Holocaust can destroy one's faith.  I'm sure that the author wanted to express his own faith in the writing of this book; I could not see how his faith, which was as strong as that of others, saved him while others were destroyed.  At the end of the book, he chose an earlier train than a friend; the friend and his family were captured and killed.  His friend was a pious man; it wasn't a lack of faith that killed him, but bad people and bad luck.<br />A caveat for readers:  one needs at least a beginner's knowledge of Hebrew or Yiddish to read this book.  My education is primarily English, with a smattering of \\"prayerbook Hebrew.\\"  That \\"edge\\" was the \\"make it or break it\\" point as to how much I got out of \\"Dare to Survive.\\"<br />This IS a good book, and belongs in Holocaust Survivor libraries and would be a good resource to someone writing a school paper about World War II.	2003-04-06

I'd thought that it wouldn't be possible for a man to write GOOD fiction from a woman's point of view.  \\"She's Come Undone\\" proved my point.  \\"Memoirs of A Geisha\\" proved me wrong - and I thought I'd never again find a well written fictional piece about a woman and written by a man.  Ernest J. Gaines proved me once again wrong in \\"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.\\"<br />Jane, born Ticey, was \\"interviewed\\" by a man who was interested in the life of a woman who'd lived from Slavery to Civil Rights.  Jane was given her name by a Yankee soldier whom she'd been told to give water by her Mistress, and it was Jane's name from then on.<br />When the slaves were freed, she set out with several going North.  Secesh men who'd been soldiers during the Civil War (in other words, days before!) killed everyone they could find - everyone except Jane and the son of another former slave.  Jane was either ten or eleven years old at the time.  She traveled with the child, Ned, and raised him as her own.<br />This book goes through her life, through the triumphs and the disappointments, through the times she spent on different plantations and doing different jobs.  Working my way through the vernacular was a challenge, but it added credibility to the story.  Hatred based on skin color is rampant throughout the book; so is Miss Jane's knowing &quot;her place.&quot;  Nonetheless, she tells with touching sorrow of the love of a white man for a Creole teacher.  Happiest in the fields, she was incredibly profound when she spoke of talking to the trees:  \\"Anybody caught talking to a chinaball tree or a thorn tree got to be crazy.  But when you talk to an oak tree that's been here all these years, and knows more than you'll ever know, it's not craziness; it's just the nobility you respect.\\" <br />Her stories give new meaning to \\"Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.\\"  There are those who will dissect the book for symbolism.  It's not necessary to do so; \\"The Autobiographyof Miss Jane Pittman\\" carries itself just fine.	2003-03-30

No one gets hurt (unless you want to count one small cut to the leg), and friends don't take advantage of one another.  In these days of strife when we can all use some upcheer, this is a wonderful book to take one's mind off one's troubles.<br />Mole meet Rat when he is out and about instead of spring-cleaning and Rat is boating.  Rat introduces Mole to many of his animal friends, including Badger (a burrowing kindred spirit of Mole's!) and the illustrious and infamous motor-car crashing Toad.  Slightly mischievous and full of fun, the animals stick by one another through thick and thin, providing muscle as well as moral support.<br />Many of the chapters \\"stand on their own;\\" thus, \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" would make good bedtime reading to a chile, a chapter a night.

She is NOT hard to follow; it's like listening to a conversation of your best girlfriends over lunch.  Altogether funny! Brilliantly written in such a way that the reader stays interested and does not become confused or lost (despite the rambles) -- and throughout, she sticks in recipes as does, much later chronologically, author Diane Mott Davidson.<br />I read this book shortly after the US waged war on Iraq.

Because he was out of the office and I'd run out of books, I borrowed this from his stack.  I actually went to work half an hour early the day after I started reading it, so that I could finish the book before he came in to claim his prize.<br />I was looking for the suspense since, on the cover, Stephen King is quoted as having said that Peter Abrahams is his &quot;favorite American suspense novelist.&quot;  I really didn't find suspense.  However, I found a good plot with likeable characters.  While this book takes place in college - a boarding school, if you will - I kept thinking that Inverness was NOT Hogwarts...<br />Nat is a young man who wins a scholarship that takes him from his working-class town to Inverness College.  Freedy is a young bodybuilder thug.  Their paths parallel but never quite meet until...<br />Nat happens upon Grace and Izzie, very rich twin sisters who attend Inverness (and very different from Patti, his hometown sweetheart).

Scarcely more than an infant when the Jews were forced to wear Jewish stars on their clothing, she absolutely knew no other way of life.  When an aunt said that she'd have men at her feet because of her beauty, she wondered if they'd be dead; that's what she knew.<br />She watched the snatching of her grandmother before her very eyes, as she hid under a table.  Her father was forced to go to Auschwitz.  Her mother begged for places for them to stay throughout the war.<br />The first half of the book deals with Roma's life before the end of the war.  The second half deals with her life after the war:  how events, seemingly minor, during the war, left permanent scars in her mind.<br />While this memoir deals with topics such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, failed marriages, show business, prejudice, and addiction, this is not a book ABOUT those topics.  This is a book about a woman who saw \\"Schindler's List\\" and recognized herself and her family as subjects, and who had the courage to reflect, document, and move on.

This does not portray an ordinary family, no matter how loosely one defines &quot;ordinary.&quot;  Better written than VC Andrews's Dollanganger series, the plot constantly challenges incest and why Tom thinks it's wrong despite his sister's arguments.  The War Zone does not commend these actions, but breaks the reader's heart when reading from the point of view of poor Tom.  The very typing of this review disturbed me.	2003-03-14

Their home was always open to whoever was hungry or in need.  Therefore, it was a natural transition to take in Jews during the German occupation of Holland.<br />Corrie ten Boom, a spinster in her fifties, was a key contact whose home - indeed, within the wall of her very bedroom! was a safe haven for Jews.  Devoutly Christian, she, along with her father and sister Betsie, simply believed in doing the right thing, as God's work.  They, along with perhaps thousands of others in Holland, were captured and spent time in concentration camps.<br />Betsie, perhaps a saint? found good in everything: every blessing and every inconvenience.  Her faith kept Corrie going throughout the worst of everything.<br />This book is incredibly well-written.  It's only the second book on the Holocaust that I've read that's written in the point of view of a non-Jew (the first being Miep Gies's \\"Anne Frank Remembered\\").  While the author is very religious, and cites her faith as the spirit that kept her going, this book does not force religion down the reader's throat - rather, it simply tries to show that faith, and the act of doing good, can help us overcome the most horrible of circumstances.<br />This book belongs in the library of every reader interested in survivors of the most horrific events of modern time.  I highly recommend it.	2003-03-08

The man was a brilliant author.<br />\\"The Periodic Table\\" cleverly takes the elements that are part of our everyday lives and uses each to illustrate a story, most of which are his view point of 1940s Italy, before or after he was sent to Auschwitz.  (Very little of this book has to do with the actual death camp, though its impressions are evident.)  Levi, a chemist, tells autobiographical tales of his desire to make people see in the logical way that chemists see the world.<br />The way that Levi weaves words might be more expected from a poet than from a scientist.  Above all, however, Levi was an observer of both elements and of human nature.  I'm only sorry that I discovered him after he died; I might have written to tell him how much I enjoyed his book.  My mother, a scientist, is emotionally unable to read any more books about the Holocaust; but as this book doesn't talk about the horrors of the camps but about the era, why, I think I'll lend it to her.<br />(amazon.com wishlist purchase)	2003-03-08
US	52480934	ROAYGMEV3XUL0	0679724494	368350214	Kiss of the Spider Woman	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Slightly difficult to follow, but not difficult to love	This was a weird book; it took me over a hundred pages to decide if I liked it, and at the surprise twist of the plot, I couldn't put it down.<br />The two characters are cellmates in an Argentine prison. Molina is incarcerated for a sex crime against a minor; Valentin is a political prisoner. Molina whiles away the nights by telling stories of the heterosexual man he loves from afar, his transgendered issues, and the movies he loves. An unlikely friendship develops. I started out liking neither character, and ended up loving them both.<br />Because I'm used to books that were originally written in English and not translated, I personally had a bit of a problem with this. I also don't like the style in which quotations are presented; it's hard for me to follow. The footnotes, albeit educational, went on and on and had little to do with the plot at hand.  (Describing homosexuality, they described one of the characters but had little to do with anything that was going on!)  Those issues will cost one \\"star\\" in the grading; however, even though I had difficulties following the book, I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, and I recommend it to anyone who'd like to widen their literary preferences.	2003-03-01

I don't know enough about history to know if this is accurate, but the story was good enough to keep me interested throughout.  There are some tactical details which, surprisingly, tie in beautifully with the story of Zenobia's loves.  Unlike many books of the romance genre, Zenobia's character is admirable not only for her beauty but for her intelligence.  Sex notwithstanding, I would let an older teenager read this book.<br />\\"Beloved\\" surprised me because it was so well-written that it does not fall into a \\"fluff\\" category.  This was a wonderful gift that was a good investment because I will read it again.  I will seek out other books by Beatrice Small because I enjoyed this book so much.	2003-03-01

However, once I got into the swing of things, I enjoyed this book very much.<br />Because the amount of artwork by any given artist is finite, discovering that there may be an undiscovered work by a famous artist is a huge discovery in the art world.  When an art student studying abroad hears that not all of Modigliani's works are available, she delightedly decides to find the one that was reputedly hidden during the War.<br />The many twists of the plot are difficult to follow until they tie together at the end of the book.  The plots do fit nicely! but it is confusing to follow throughout the body of the book.<br />This is not Ken Follett's best work.  However, for an early work, it's quite good; furthermore, it's a lot better than a lot of the drek that some authors are trying to pass off as literature.	2003-02-11

It then became the last of the currently published Grisham books for me to read; if it appalled an attorney, would *I* be able to read it?<br />This was such an incredible story that I was surprised to read this was John Grisham's first book.<br />The premise is simple:  two drunks repeatedly rape a ten year old girl, crushing her poor little body and mind.  She's hurt so badly that, even when she's out of critical condition, the damage control assessment is that she'll never bear children.<br />An arrest is quick.  When the prisoners are being moved, the irate father shoots them down, injuring an officer of the court in the process.<br />The underlying story isn't quite so simple.  The book is set in the South.  The little girl is black.  The rapists are white.<br />On the one hand, it did disturb me that the father wanted a fair trial, one that never came to fruition for the rapists (who were dead long before a trial date).  On the other hand, while reading, an old Twisted Sister lyric repeated over and over in my head:<br />    \\"Now before you shake your head/Think if it was your child instead!\\"*<br />Those lyrics haunted me in the mid-80s when I first heard them, and I'd never forgotten.<br />Another major aspect of this book is the amount of prejudice there appears to be in the South.  I'm from a middle-class family in New England, and I honestly didn't know that things were still this bad.  We have prejudice, sure, but I've only heard of one Klan rally up here.  I'm not sure if my parents did a disservice to me by raising me to judge people by their actions and not by the color of their skin, because I was shocked by what I read.  (How can we human beings expect world peace when our own country is at war with itself?)<br />\\"A Time to Kill\\" will stay with me for a long, long time.  It made me think a lot.  I'm glad I got over my fear, and that I read it.  Frightening though it is, it is VERY real, and it's an eye-opening book for parents.<br />*from \\"Street Justice,\\" part of HORROR-TERIA (The Beginning) by Twisted Sister, 1984	2003-02-09

The first half of \\"Eva, Evita\\" deals with the life and death of Eva Duarte de Peron.  Born into poverty, she left her family at age fourteen to pursue a theatrical career.  She met Juan Peron, a widower colonel, and managed his political career and election to President of Argentina.  She took from the rich to give to the poor working class (and to the richer - namely, herself and her closest friends) who worshipped her as a saint.  Evita died of ovarian cancer.<br />The second half of the book illustrates just how strong Evita's power was.  Juan, a pedophile, shopped for mistresses in the school system.  He was unable to control his staff, and the people revolted.  His hold over the Argentine people was released, and he was forced into exile.<br />There are many books about Eva Peron.  This book paints a better picture than others I have read; it also casts Juan Peron in a more unfavorable light.  \\"Eva, Evita\\" goes into depth about the embalming and preservation of Evita's corpse, its theft, and the doctor who spent three years preserving her for posterity.  These sections are incredibly morbid, but are important to the history of the legend of Eva Duarte de Peron.  There was a bit more political background than I expected; however, this gave me a more broad view of everything surrounding the events that led to Juan Peron's election and fall from grace.	2003-02-03

They're locked up in a minimum security prison, where they're running a money making scam.<br />The parallel plot is of the Presidential campaign of Aaron Lake, which is frighteningly prophetic (the book was published in 2000) of current events.<br />The two plots don't meet until the CIA become involved, in a storyline that is reminiscent of Colonel Flagg of M*A*S*H (just as paranoid, but not as funny).<br />The two storylines are hard to follow in the beginning of the book.  A potential leading character, \\"Ned,\\" was introduced and dropped.  This is not Grisham's best work.  There was not one character I *liked* until I was more than halfway through the book, and I wasn't crazy about him. <br />If another author had written this book, it would have deserved four stars.  However, I've read Grisham's earlier works and later works, and I know he's capable of better.	2003-01-26

It traces history back to duplicating the printed word, and covers presses, copiers, the Internet, and computers.  Also covered is Fair Use and Patents.  The book is written so that non-professionals and non-students can understand it, yet I believe that it would be an asset to any attorney's office or to any law curriculum.<br />Others who will enjoy this book are the Mac/Apple fans.  \\"Mac people\\" are a clan of their own, and those I've met will collect anything with substantial Mac information.  The condensed history of how Mac came to be is a worthy addition to a Macintosh library.<br />Furthermore, \\"The Illustrated Story of Copyright\\" should be required reading for all musicians, all VCR owners, all computer owners, all freelancers... the list is endless.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to read it, but wish I'd known about it sooner.  I doubt that I'll recommend another book to as wide a range of people.<br />(this book was recommended to me ... then purchased from my amazon.com wishlist.)	2003-01-24

If you want to learn \\"How to Lose Friends and Alienate People,\\" by all means follow Toby Young's lead:  take a lot of money for a job you don't care about doing well, name-drop, be a boorish drunk, and show absolutely no respect for the people who helped you get to where you are.<br />That's pretty much Young's book in a nutshell.  This jerk's star-struck behavior would embarrass even the most shameless groupie.  He's so busy trying to out-shock the people that he last shocked that he's not even a good friend.<br />However, the book's saving grace is that Young is a great author.  I wouldn't want to meet this man, but I'm not sorry that I finished the book.  A lesser author telling the same story wouldn't have been able to get the tale published!  <br />One hopes that he learned something about himself when he wrote; further, one hopes that he has outgrown that old character for good.  Would I recommend this book?  Possibly, to someone so self-centered that he wouldn't realize that I was handing him a mirror.  It's certainly funny, in a very disturbing way.	2003-01-21

He's got a beautiful doctor wife.  He's got an Ivy League education.<br />After a homeless man holds him and eight colleagues hostage at gunpoint, Attorney Brock learns that he has a conscience.<br />Brock speaks to the legal ally to the homeless, Mordecai Green.  Between Green's asking for Brock's help at a shelter one snowy night, and Brock finding some damning information about his firm, Brock reverts from his money-making ambition to his much earlier desire to save the world.  An addicted woman and a cookie-loving little boy make as much of a difference in his world as the gun-toting hostage-holder.   Something good came from something bad, and that's a marvel, even in the world of fiction.<br />This is an incredible story about the Right and Wrong that's in front of us every day, and which many of us just don't see.  Only Grisham could tell this story from a lawyer's point of view, and not sound pompous.  Indeed, even the surprising final chapter didn't sound ridiculous.<br />All in all, this is a gripping tale that is not only worth reading, but worth recommending.  My habits will probably change based on having read this book.<br />(this book was purchased from my amazon.com wishlist)	2003-01-20

The story begins as Luther and Nora drop their daughter at the airport to pursue time with the Peace Corps.  Luther, an accountant, crunches the numbers indicating the small fortune that his family spent on the previous Christmas; since their daughter isn't in town, he suggests that he and Nora take half the money they spent and take a cruise.<br />We North Americans seem to spend a lot of the holiday season ... well, spending.  We seem to have lost the interfaith idea of togetherness, and many have found their only religion to be shopping and spending and competing, Oh My.<br />Grisham's characters' dynamics are so real that I forgot that I was reading a work of fiction.  Everything that irked me about these people was features in people I've known.  The difference between these characters and the characters of my own world is that, in &quot;Skipping Christmas,&quot; these characters surprised me in the end.<br />This is not typical Grisham.  It contains little detail, though what detail there is paints a clear picture.  It will not give the reader a good example of John Grisham's depth as a writer, but it will give the person new to Grisham an idea of the amount of skill he possesses.<br />The biggest problem with this book?  As with all books by John Grisham, I finished reading far too soon.<br />(Purchased for me via my wishlist )	2003-01-10

It highlights many topics, but none in depth.  There are eight pages of color photos, and some black and white illustrations.  However, for every thing I found wrong with this book, there was an equal and opposite reaction.  For example:<br />Regarding latex gloves:  \\"Every piercer MUST wear latex gloves when touching sterilized tools or jewelry.\\"  Should this read \\"Every BODY ARTIST?\\"  (After all, NOT only piercers should be gloved!) Furthermore, what about artists or clients with latex allergies?  However, pointing out that gloves should be changed if the [artist] picks up the phone was very important.<br />Regarding piercing guns:  not enough emphasis, in my opinion, placed on the fact that professional piercers never use guns.  However, the author DOES mention it, which is information that a lot of people don't know.<br />There were a few snide comments about people who get body modifications to be cool.   While that wouldn't be my motivation, if I were the author I might have said something more to the effect of One's body is sacred, so one might want to take that into consideration before making permanent changes for the sake of fashion (in other words, perhaps less condescending).<br />I'm also not crazy about the layout of the book.  Piercing and tattoo information is separated within chapters, instead of being in separate chapters.  Also, I don't know why henna and scarification were in the same chapter!<br />The author seems to have fleshed out an outline, but doesn't seem to have gone much further.  It's a shame, because there is a ton of information on the Internet that would have given a great deal of substance to this book.<br />There IS some incredibly valuable information in this book -- information that many people wouldn't have without doing some research AND information with which most people are not armed before walking into a studio.<br />(This book was a Wishlistpurchase.)	2003-01-08

Throw in a biological father on another coast, a brooding surfing/artist boyfriend whose brother runs several fine coffee shops, a tarot reading best friend in a nursing home, and a doll named Gingerbread -- all that, and you're still not going to get a good story unless the author knows her stuff.  Even a splash of a hot-hot-hot ex boyfriend and a boarding school scandal won't do it, unless the author knows how to capture characters on the written page.  This, gentle readers, is an incredible book by a fabulous author.<BR>While Cid in \\"Gingerbread\\" isn't quite one's typical teenager (she's got a bit more money than most), the trials and tribulations are incredibly real with this obviously brilliant character.  There are no minor characters in this book; everyone is very much alive.<BR>I first heard of Gingerbread, which is mentioned in a chapter of the 2002 Children's Writers & Illustrators Market (available on amazon.com).  The description is good enough that, instead of going to another library to do research on homework this weekend, I made a trip to a library with a children's and young adults' room specifically so that I could take this book off the shelf to read.  I read it in under two hours.  (It was a welcome relief from legal tomes!  Furthermore, even though I'm now going to have to spend Sunday in the law library, meaning that I won't have any days off, giving up an afternoon to read something THIS delightful was worth it.)<BR>This book will make a unique gift for a teenage girl or boy who isn't quite as angelic as the Bobbsey Twins -- or perhaps for the parent of such a young adult.

Her shopping is far enough out of control that an entire novel could discuss it without once becoming boring. Many of us (ahem) have been guilty of the lies to ourselves about our debts and our needs and our rationalizations. We recognize Becky in ourselves. However, the seriousness of the problem is painted so comically that we don't put down the book with guilt when we recognize ourselves. The tone is droll, and while it's not a heart-stopping thriller, the reader continues, wanting to know how Becky gets herself out of each new mess! Becky surprises the reader with the way she gets out of each disaster -- it's all about finding her niche, and not the easy way out. Kinda leaves me with some hope for my own credit. This was a wonderful book, read in an afternoon and worth sharing. (If I share it, then the purchase is justified as half price, right?)	2001-08-30

I sobbed when I read Big's letters to Jerri's family.<br />I wish them all well, and thank them for sharing their story with us.  This was a great book.	2001-05-05

A woman, who'd stopped some hijackers dead in their tracks, was missing.  Mission:  to bring Amanda Pym back to the United States.<br />Despite a beating each, Mrs. Pollifax and Farrell both got off easier than usual.

Tracie + Jon = best friends<br />Jon asks Tracie to remake him into a bad boy like Tracie's boyfriend, Phil -- a magnet that will attract women.  At first Tracie balks, but then sees the potential for a story.  Their regular waitress at Java, the Hut, predicts that Jon will take offense as he realizes that Tracie's makeover points out what she sees as his faults.  Phil hates the attention that Tracie lavishes on her project, while Tracie's best friend, Laura, encourages it.<br />On the one hand, the story grates against my nerves:  what ever happened to being yourself?  Forcing upon him $200 haircut for the sole purpose of impressing women?  Getting a vegetarian to buy a leather jacket?  Talking him into dangerous sporting activities to &quot;practice&quot;?  It does seem shallow.<br />On the other hand... my sister's former boss used to take those cheesy romances and use them to line her cat's litter box because, really, how true to life could they be?  Imagine an unsoiled cheesy romance mixed with the script of &quot;Grease II,&quot; where Michael does what he can to change himself into something that Stephanie will love.  <br />When my mom tried to read this book, she threw it down in disgust halfway through.  I stayed up until 2:00 a.m. because I couldn't put it down.  IF you can look beyond the shallowness of attracting people based solely on physical attributes and bad attitude, this is a great book.	2001-05-02

However, I cannot in good conscience suggest to the average reader that s/he waste good money on this book.  If you want to read it, support your local library.  If you want to buy a book, I suggest you look elsewhere.<br />Nathan Zuckerman, a friend of the protagonist, Coleman Silk, narrates &quot;The Human Stain&quot;.  In the story, Coleman approached Nathan to tell his, Coleman's, story.  Most of the story that Nathan tells is based on his conjecture. He discusses a diary to which he's never given access.  He discusses events that may or may not have happened.<br />Coleman's parents and siblings play but a small role in the book.  With the exception of them and of Faunia, Coleman's lover, none of the characters is likeable.  Indeed, many were downright despicable.  Maybe some readers will find this true to life.  I did not.  I only finished the book because I continued to hope that it would get better.  It did not.<br />If this is a good book, then I wasted several years in school.  Remember diagramming sentences?  If I gave a typical sentence from &quot;The Human Stain&quot; to a class to diagram, the class would collectively walk out.  I don't know to what audience the book was geared, but it often came off as quite pretentious.<br />I love to read, and was horribly disappointed by this book.  The bare bones of the story were good.  Fleshed out, it wasn't.	2001-04-25

ALL emphasis falls on teenaged, unmarried Katie Fisher.  There is shock and scandal in the Amish community.  Elly reluctantly takes the case.  <br />This is culture shock for Elly, who must stay at the farm because Katie is released into her custody.  The conditions are appaling for an attorney in that she doesn't have a way to use the Net or her laptop, or even to charge her cell phone.  Nonetheless, as she tries to find out who really killed the baby, she warms to the different environment.<br />There are twists and turns in both Elly's and Katie's lives throughout the book that make me HOPE!!! for a sequel.  The story is warm and, despite the murder, as clean as linens on the line.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery or anyone who is looking for a different kind of modern mystery.	2001-04-22

Newly wed Alice had to stay with the mother-in-law she despised while her husband went to war.  The story is told first-person in letters to Alice's sister.  Alice's contribution to the war effort, apart from giving her husband to the cause, was working with other women to make quilts for the soldiers.<br />Alice's character grows from a slightly spoiled teen into a kind woman as the years of the Civil War pass.  I grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.<br />While the book is marketed as a mystery, the mystery part of the story is not as significant as in the other mysteries touted on today's market.  Despite (faulty?) advertising, I enjoyed the book immensely.  It's a quick read and worth sharing.  I'm looking forward to finding other books by the author.	2001-04-21

Not only was the small community shaken by the murder, but naturally Pickett found himself involved -- especially when he realized who the murderer might be.<br />The more I read, the more I liked Norbert -- who never appears in the book ALIVE.  <br />Between the purity of the writing, the decent characters, and the  intriguing sub plot involving Pickett's son, I'm interested in reading the sequel (if one is written) as well as the other series by Eric Wright.  The author caught my attention, kept it throughout the book, and left me wanting a little more.  I believe that that means that &quot;Death of a Hired Man&quot; is a success.	2001-04-21

Cleveland Amory, making much ado about (often) nothing, is more of a fussbudget than a curmudgeon.  His tone is mildly condescending, as though he is trying to be funny -- something like Asimov, but Asimov was brighter.<br />I forced myself to keep reading, in the name of Amazon.com reviews, even though every few pages put me to sleep.  In the three days (!) it took me to wade through the muck, my entire sleep schedule was disrupted.  My own cat, meanwhile, showed his dislike by repeatedly resting his ample, uh, tail on the book.  I had to keep reminding myself that &quot;The Cat and the Curmudgeon&quot; was NOT the WORST book I had ever read.  I planned to rate the book at a * or a generous **, all the while scheming to meet Amory in a bar for the purpose of dumping a drink on his cantankerous self.<br />The stock certificates were amusing, and I can smile at how Polar Bear has Amory wrapped around his little, uh, claw.  However, I did not find the book, as a whole, to be enjoyable.<br />When I reached the VIth of VII chapters, I reevaluated my opinion.  I did enjoy reading about the Fund's Ranch sanctuary -- enough so that I will be looking for Cleveland Amory's &quot;Ranch of Dreams: A Lifelong Protector of Animals Shares the Story of His Extraordinary Sanctuary&quot; (available on Amazon).<br />I'm not sure who is the curmudgeon, or if there are two.  I found Amory's prattle unbearable at times.  However, I can't help but like a fellow animal lover -- and indeed, the idea to tell women in fur that it makes them look fat, why, it's enough to earn the whole book an additional star right there. <br />In summary, I'm glad that I didn't spend $... on the book, but also glad that I read it, and glad that I supported my local Bookmobile in doing so.  I will give Amory another chance.	2001-04-19

She draws colorful characters -- in this as well as in all her books -- with whom many kids can relate.  They're not the most popular kids in school, but they're interesting and fun and the kind of kids with whom I wanted to be friends when i was in school.

Thank you.)<br />This wonderful, heartwarming story revolves around an evening class and its students.  Maeve Binchy does an outstanding job of portraying each character and how their lives weave in and out and connect like the most beautiful of tapestries.<br />I simply do not have the words to describe this book.  I liked every single character.  Maeve Binchy did a fantastic job - even the worst person had some redeeming qualities, but not so much that the book was nauseating and syrupy.<br />The members of the class form a community.  They might not have met, given their different walks of life, if not for the class.  The interactions the people had with one another brought out the best in all of them, and the story was an absolute joy.<br />As I said, I simply cannot express how great this book is.

His best friend, Sheilah, encouraged him to adopt a dog to pull him out of his depression.  While Ginny wasn't love &quot;at first sight,&quot; it was love within an hour.<br />Ginny not only forced Philip to care about life again, but she also opened his eyes to the plight of stray cats in his Long Island neighborhood.  Ginny has a sixth sense when it comes to cats with a handicap or illness.  Fighting her natural instinct to attack, she &quot;talked&quot; (barked?) Philip adopting many unfortunate cats.<br />There is almost no conflict, no climax, in this book; rather, it's a collection of anecdotes.  It's a little sappy but, for a non-author, Philip tells a great story.  I do hope its sales supplement his income. It is of note that Philip, Ginny, and Sheilah have caught many strays, gotten shots for the strays and had them neutered, and then re-released them -- out of pocket, even though this is a great service to their community.<br />I'd like to know what comes next (after the sequel &quot;The Blessing of the Animals&quot;) -- is Ginny still alive, have either Sheilah or Philip found love interests (ahem!!!), and if, perhaps, Ginny has been able to train other dogs to do her work?<br />This is an enjoyable story, and contains the all-important lessons of life after accidents -- not only for Philip, but for many of the cats that he and Ginny have saved.	2001-04-13

The protagonist is his daughter Abby; points of view are also provided by Jud's lady friend Willa and by Felicia, an old family friend.  The suspense is beautifully meshed, with even the smallest holes patched by the end of the book.  Amidst the search for the killer is woven a wonderful storyline:  Jud's friends, his daughter's marriage, Jud's clues to his murderer in his new novel, and Jud's surprising legacy.  <br />Abby's love for her father went back far enough to solve the mystery:  She had proofread for him back in the days when he wrote computer manuals, and the key was in the computer.  I thought that this was brilliant.<br />I'm used to particular twists in mysteries, and was so afraid that this book would follow the patterns of other authors.  Happily, it didn't, and I finished the book satisfied with the ending.<br />I couldn't put down the book, and I strongly recommend it!	2001-04-12

What  about her cruel sister-in-law, Derek's sister Yvonne?  Is Cath's attorney, Luc, really on her side?<br />The book begins (oddly enough, like the beginning of Zenna Henderson's &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;) with a woman  on a bus in the dead of night, fleeing problems she doesn't want to face.  (It was this sole similarity to  Henderson's books that made me continue.)  The woman, who is suffering from amnesia and who  makes up a name from bits and pieces she overhears, thinks that she has escaped.  At this point, she  is mugged, and the hospital and police put out a bulletin that brings the sister-in-law of the woman --  CATH, we learn, -- to her &quot;aid.&quot;<br />Throughout the book, Cath begins to remember bits and pieces of a frightening truth.  The book is  hard to put down, not only because of the suspense but because there are phrases that are downright  poetic. Cath's (the author's?) enjoyment that comes from etymology makes the book such fun to  read.<br />The twist in plot -- and in the characters' minds -- makes for a good book.  I'm only holding back a *  because &quot;The Night Bus&quot; left me feeling almost... unclean... as though people can't be trusted.  That,  and only that, caused the story to be unsatisfying.  However, on the whole, it's a good, solid book.	2001-04-10

Anne Frank's diary is an honest look at a growing teen and her views of W.W.II as it affected her and her family.<br />The Biography is the perfect companion to The Diary Of A Young Girl because it shows more trauma history than a teenaged girl would have noticed.  It deeply delves into Anne's past -- the family tree alone is priceless.  There is new insight on Edith.  Of equal importance is the look at Anne and Margot's surviving friends.<br />When a child dies, it doesn't matter if he or she is rich or poor, plain or a princess.  What matters is that history has been altered because the child won't get a chance to make a difference.  <br />Millions of people -- six million Jews, Gypsies, gays, people of all religions, and soldiers and other innocent victims  -- died in World War II.  In the grand scheme of things, none is more or less important than another.  Anne Frank, unlike most murdered children, has been immortalized by her writing.  The world made her into a heroine for surviving two years more than many others. <br />The reason that she should be considered a heroine is that she brought forth a truth that might otherwise have been hidden.  <br />This truth is more evident when partnered with Anne Frank: The Biography by Melissa Mueller.	2001-04-05

The characters in &quot;The Key to Rebecca&quot; are real enough that you love them, hate them, root for them, hope they get captured. They're clever -- perhaps more clever than the characters in &quot;real&quot; life upon whom they're based.<br />Buy it for the fabulous storytelling.

An interesting story might lurk in &quot;Eleanor's Rebellion,&quot; but a lot of it is lost in poor editing.  This book is ruined by run-on sentences that point to the wrong objects, use of parentheses when another sentence would work better, and switching from past to present tense and back to past again   David, the author (and protagonist) studied writing in college, but it's not evident in his book.  The narrative sounds as though he recited into a tape recorder but did not tighten his sentences upon transcription.  He discusses a scene and then goes back in time, and then jumps back to the present.  He discusses wonderful photographs, which aren't included in the book.  He also misuses a lot of long words in cases in which diminutive words would suffice.  I was unable to read more than twenty pages at a time without cursing the editor.  A final note on the format: the font used (for the first edition hardcover) is hard on the reader, in that commas look a lot like semicolons.  This makes many hard-to-read sentences even harder to interpret.<br />David was put up for adoption by his biological mother, who visited him in the orphanage and who adopted him before his second birthday.  David blames much of his life on the lie his mother told him.  He cites journal reports of problems in other orphans of his time.  He doesn't delve into his mother's obvious emotional problems that he might have inherited, nor does he discuss how his use of LSD might have led to some of his problems.  <br />In the book, he is obsessed with the biological father he never knew.  Perhaps some of his problems do stem from that.  However, since he didn't know that he was adopted until he was middle-aged, he seems to mislay the blame of his apathy on this deep dark family secret.  Instead of a victim, he comes off as a whiny brat.<br />David professes love for his wife when they first meet, but seems almost indifferent in her throughout the book - and in his children and siblings.<br />Again, I feel that a great story lies in &quot;Eleanor's Rebellion,&quot; but the author is clearly not a writer.  A spell check and a thesaurus do not an author make.  There is no passion in a subject that always seems to be enveloped in enchantment.<br />The best virtue of this book would be its ability to teach.  A high school composition teacher would do well to give copies to a freshman class to edit and correct.  I may contact my high school comp. teacher; I think that he would enjoy the challenge.	2001-03-26

(I've read book reviews in which the male author is praised for writing as a woman.  None of those authors can hold a candle to Heinlein.)  She not only describes her journey -- from Mars to Venus en route to Earth -- but also her dreams and desires and her aversion to prejudice.  She's similar to Terran teenage girls of our time.<br />The ending (originally written or originally published, take your pick) is a bit rough for many teenagers, in my opinion.  Of course, if they're reading Heinlein, they're probably not ordinary teenagers!  (More's the pity!)<br />Heinlein's got it down pat, to the cool older woman to whom Poddy looks up, to Poddy's crush on the rich heir, to the bratty yet brilliant younger brother.  For a mature teenager, male or female, this book will make a great gift, and one that the young adult will re-read as a full-grown adult.	2001-03-19

When Kat needs to escape her nightmares, she seizes the opportunity to go out of town undercover to find the client's goddaughter's killer.<br />The people she meets are warm and real to the reader, and I was surprised by the identification of the killer.<br />Biggest problem with this book:  there seem to be two important sentences missing in the chapter in which Kat meets the victim's sister and brother in law.  I don't know if they are publisher or author omissions, but they made it difficult for me to follow an important chapter.<br />While this isn't the author's best work, it is better by FAR than many of the mysteries out there.

Ken Blanchard's books were recommended to me by a former employer.  Because my position included customer service, I purchased RAVING FANS. The book takes a lighthearted look at the serious subject of customer service.  It's easy to follow and contains valuable advice.  It was good enough to be recommeneded to a co-worker, who has since gone into business for herself. While reading, I realized what wonderful service I receive from waitresses, my hairdresser, and my mechanic.  These people could have read this book from cover to cover.  I think that readers will be pleasantly surprised to recognize people in their everyday life who have made their customers into Raving Fans. Unfortunately, the employer who recommended Blanchard to me was not interested in reading the book.  He didn't like my implementing Blanchard's suggestions -- despite clients calling and, indeed, RAVING, that the lessons I learned were increasing business.

However, compared to his neighbors and tenants, he was well-off.  Furthermore, when one looks at the love and respect lavished upon him, as well as the adventures he had, one can only conclude that he was quite wealthy.<br />Carter was President of the United States when I was in grammar school.  The information about him that I learned from school projects and Current Events was favorable.  It is obvious that the experiences that are recalled in &quot;An Hour Before Daylight&quot; shaped this man into the leader he became.  It's also evident that these experiences gave him the empathy that makes him work for Habitat for Humanity.<br />In summary:  this book is a valuable history of not only Jimmy Carter's boyhood, but also an era of the United States that I never learned about in any class.  I highly recommend it.	2001-02-25

If I were an artist, I would try to recapture the magic on canvas. Alas, I am a writer, and a mediocre one at that.  Therefore, I can only try to tell you how delightful this tale is. As an adult who loves fantasy and science fiction, I was shocked when I realized that I had not yet read this tale.  When I learned that a dear friend was reading it at bedtime to her first grader, I realized that I was long overdue. This is an amazingly delightful story.  Aside from its tale, it looks at beings of different backgrounds and their conflicts.  Not everything works out perfectly, and the ends don't always justify the means.  However, the characters' characters grow, even when their stature does not. This story was written in the 1930s.  Other than the lack of female characters, it is absolutely timeless and will still be popular a hundred or five hundred years from now.	2001-02-25

It's of a genre that I'd never read before.<br />This is a fantastical tale told in the points of view of the Rhymer's hosts, his human wife, and himself. Of a Ren-Faire setting, its descriptions are fluid and visible to the reader.  It's a story of many kinds of love -- the love of the Rhymer's childless hosts of the Rhymer and of the girl up the hill, and of the Rhymer of them, of the girl, and of the Elfin Queen who cannot love him back in a way that he understands.  It's a tale of human growth, of restraint, of sadness, and of joy.<br />I will be looking for more books by Ellen Kushner, and I highly recommend &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; to you.	2000-10-16

Having read &quot;The Pillow Friend&quot; feverishly from cover to cover, I'm still not sure if Agnes Grey suffers from delusions, or if she's lucky enough to be able to really have her wishes come true &quot;as long as she accepts the consequences.&quot;<br />Agnes is a very likeable character whose life is not fairy-tale perfect.  Lisa Tuttle, whose works I've been reading since I was an adolescent, paints vivid, realistic identities when she creates people.<br />How very ... odd ... that amazon.com advertises buckwheat pillows, those pillows for a good night's rest, on the page describing a book of dreams wrapped in nightmares like egg rolls!<br />The story folds and unfolds like a piece of fabric, plot flowing smoothly from beginning to end.  The patterns are slightly disturbing, and I'm still not sure whether it was madness or  magic bringing gifts to Agnes.  However, this tale is an incredibly enjoyable read, and it makes me want to continue my quest to find more Lisa Tuttle books.	2000-10-14

I don't know if that's because I'm simply not smart enough, or if the fault lies in the writer.  (it's probably me.)  While Andrew Vachss remains one of my absolute favorite authors, I become increasingly annoyed that I can't &quot;get&quot; his books first time round.  It is only for that reason that I am giving this book four stars instead of five.  Someone brighter than I may be able to glean from its pages a better description than I'm giving you now.<br />&quot;Dead and Gone&quot; removes a key player from Burke's family.  When loyal readers think that Burke's soul can't get any darker than, say, &quot;Sacrifice&quot; and the following &quot;Down In the Zero,&quot; we have NO idea what Vachss is about to spring on us in &quot;Dead and Gone.&quot;  I have no shame in telling you that my heart broke.<br />This book also introduces a new location and new players, including Gem.  Gem is worth noting because she is Burke's first slender woman, and I am interested in seeing how that will play in future books.  I also wonder whether the new location is a one-shot deal, as in &quot;Blossom,&quot; or if Burke is moving across the country as the writer has.<br />The new characters are three-dimensional and very complex, but it will take some time and some more writing for them to become as lovable to me as Michelle and Terry and the Prof and, well, you know them all.<br />In a nutshell: Great subject matter, exceptional writing, VERYcomplex.  Highly recommended.<br />p.s.  while I have your attention: all those out-of-print Burke books that I spent forever searching for, crawling on my hands and knees in dusty used-book stores, have come back into print and are available on amazon.com.  I strongly urge new fans to go back to the roots.	2000-10-14

Recommended by my friend Monica (a fellow bibliophile whom I met on a book chat board), &quot;The Tortilla Curtain&quot; has to be one of the saddest tales I've ever read.<br />The parallels between Delaney + Kyra and Candido + America are stronger than the differences.  So often, near-similar events happen to both couples.  However, what seems like tragedy to the privileged first couple is NOTHING compared to the agonies faced by the second couples. Their lives come so close to one another, and indeed they meet -- but they never overlap to the extent that Candido and America will ever enjoy the fortune of Delaney and Kyra.<br />(Incidentally, I don't know if it's the author's intention, but according to babynames.com &quot;Delaney&quot; means &quot;Descendant of the Challenger&quot; and &quot;Kyra&quot; means &quot; Ladylike.&quot;  I couldn't find a definition for &quot;Candido,&quot; and America's name is simply cruel irony, as you'll learn when you buy this book.)<br />And just when you think it can't get any worse. . . it goes beyond your imagination.<br />And you just KNOW what's going to happen to the baby.<br />The scariest thing about this story is that it's probably based on truth.  This book was dark and miserable and not at all entertaining.  You know what?  Neither is life.<br />I read this book when I was as low as I thought I could ever go.  Above all else, this book will open your eyes to what you have -- and to what other's don't have.  Unless you're a darned fool, &quot;The Tortilla Curtain&quot; will make you VERY grateful.	2000-10-10

Rita Mae is one of my very favorite authors, and I  find that I have accidentally missed a few of her books.  So... I was  searching... and found this.<br />I'm not athletic, and I'm not into spectator  sports.  This book, rather than boring me, made tennis sound  interesting!<br />I found it fascinating to learn that an active woman at the  top of her field could have many of the insecurities that my friends and I  have -- and some of the bad habits.  Martina comes off as being a warm,  likeable person.  She seems very smart and very accomplished -- and very  proud of herself, without coming off as being haughty.<br />I don't know  whether Martina's English-As-A-Second-Language plays a factor in the  narration, or whether it's George Vecsey's writing here, but the book,  while clear, seems JUST A TRIFLE stilted.  I'm also not quite sure who was  just a friend and who she dated... not that it mattered, but it confused  me.  It reads like an A+ book report written by a senior in high school,  not like a story.<br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed it a great deal.	2000-08-11

One of my best friends and I agree that a book of short stories is as good as a sampler at a great restaurant.

There are twenty-three authors  in this book.  Rather than risk the price of twenty-three books, I sampled  all these authors for the price of one book.<br />Some of the stories were  amazing.

A frank story about real characters<br />Jenny, Garp's mother, is a woman who  knows exactly what she wants and how to get it.  She doesn't hurt people to  get it, either.<br />The Ellen Jamesians remind me of the men who chant  (ironic!) outside the women's clinic in my home town... where ANNUAL EXAMS  are performed... heart believes in a cause, time could be better spent doing  something constructive.  (They are so ridiculous that they MUST be  real!)<br />Helen is a decent woman who's a little misguided.<br />Same goes for  Garp.  He's as broken as they come without having a breakdown; this makes  him human.<br />Anyone reading the reviews I've written can see that the more  realistic the characters seem to me, the more I'll like the story.   &quot;Realistic&quot; does not mean &quot;The Nelsons&quot; but, rather,  well-rounded, honest, unique, colorful.

Notonly does she share normal, every-day fears with most teenagers, she also has to live up to a mother who was Most Popular when she was in school, and a brother who is happily following in his mother's shining star.<br />Geri is content with a few quality friends, despite her mother's constant berating, until she meets Dave. Handsome, charming Dave is, by all appearances, everything that her mother would just love. He introduces Geri not only to a few of his popular friends, but also to alcohol.<br />As Geri's whole world spirals into alcoholic stupor, she occasionally lifts her head out of the mist to watch her family fall apart.<br />I bought this book for a friend who was drinking way too much. She either read it and straightened out, or she read it and hides from me better than she did before. One way or the other, it opened her eyes on some level.<br />I was somewhat pretty and somewhat popular in school. I drank in school. Had I had a predisposition to alcoholism, I would have wound up like Geri. It's a scary and startling book.	2000-07-08

I read this book over fifteen years ago, and remember it as vividly as yesterday.<br />Marcy is a well-rounded protagonist, and not just literally.  However, as a teenager, she sees herself -- her self-image -- as one of her  biggest problems.<br />There is SO much more to this story than Marcy's grey  sweatshirt! <br />She is lucky enough to not only have a supportive (albeit  kinda weak-willed) mother, an adoring little brother, good friends, and a  teacher who teaches her about SELF-esteem.<br />I came across this title when  looking for Paula Danziger and hope to find grown-up books by her.

Protagonists include not only  patients but a doctor as well.<br />The doctor has many of the same types of  pitfalls as the patients portrayed.  The reader cannot really be sure what  keeps him on one side of the stethescope, if you will, and the patients on  the other.  THAT is what isn't fair.<br />Norma Klein paints warm, human  characters.  She portrays sex as it is in real life, and not as some  authors do (as something to be purchased by the hour).  You find yourself  cheering for her characters, as tho they are people you know.<br />When I  finished the book, I turned to the last page and learned that Norma Klein  is the &quot;late&quot; Norma Klein.

Her characters are rich as chocolate mousse, and just  about as satisfying.  Brown's love of animals makes me want to read her  books; her style makes me want to read them again.<br />This mystery was not  only &quot;right up my alley&quot; but reminiscent of personal friends.   However, while I figured out Who Done It, I didn't figure out the REAL  mystery until it was spelled out for me.  It was clever, and I admire Brown  for pulling the wool over my eyes.	2000-07-02

Mary MacCracken had an incredibly hard job, and did it well.  She warmed the hearts of  misunderstood children, while warming the hearts of the readers of her  story.  Children don't choose to be emotionally disturbed and learning  disabled, but teachers do choose to help them.

It wasn't so detail-oriented as to make the  reader clutch his head in one hand and an Excedrin in the other -- yet I  could visualize what was going on.

The lovely lady at The Novel Trader in North Haven, CT, turned me on to the first one.  I'm getting Obsidian Butterfly next week. I read the series in under two  months, buying them one at a time.  The stories are gripping.  I expected  to read comparing throughout to the Anne Rice books, but they cannot be  compared except in writing styles.  These are two different breeds of  vampire, and if one author is right then the other may not be WRONG because  they are simply... different. Difference in writing styles... Anne Rice  inundates with detail, like a fine Victorian outfit.  Lovely, breathtaking  even, but not something I could look at for too long without becoming  bewildered and lost.  Laurell K. Hamilton writes like Anita Blake dresses:   polo shirts and jeans.  Concise, does the job and, when covering the right  person, flattering. Anita can take care of herself and she knows it, but  she's not a braggart, just matter-of-fact.  The Master of the City and the  Alpha Werewolf are both in love with her, and the character isn't full of  herself NOR self-disparaging.  (It seems that one extreme or the other is  the norm for book characters.) There ARE occasional editing (comman and  semicolon) errors in the paperback versions, which drew me from the story  like an unexpected slap. My suggestion to the reader (aside from reading  ALL the Anita Blake books!) is to do an internet search for Anita Blake.   There are some really neat web sites out there. I am incredibly grateful  that Laurell K. Hamilton took her ideas and put them down for the world to  see.	2000-07-02

It is a simple  adjustment, but an adjustment nonetheless.<br />I have obviously missed a book  somewhere along the way, as there are holes in the plots between I, VAMPIRE  and THE VAMPIRE PAPERS.

Pamela manages to bring a personal aspect to the interviews --  while maintaining her true image as a friendly face and not a hanger-on.  The book is well-written and witty at times, even though the deaths are  heartbreaking. It's incredibly apropos that I received the book as a gift  from a dear friend who owns a record store! My only slightly negative  comment is that Pamela des Barres has never written about the Grateful Dead  in her books. Her love of music isn't confined to any one genre, and she  was in the same area of the country at the same time... I believe that  Jerry's death was well before publication of this book. I'm looking forward  to another history by Pamela des Barres. She brings history to life, and  makes it more fun than any of my high school teachers ever did (no  offense!) even when the stories are sad. Thanks for writing the book :)  Cordially, Rebekah Sue Harris	2000-02-13

I was sorely disappointed; most of them were garbage, and not worth the paper upon which they were printed.<br />NOT  SO with I VAMPIRE.  Romkey's characters bear similarities to Rice's, in  that they are super-human but not supernatural, and that they are drawn to  the arts.  However, each author offers delightfully different characters to  the genre.<br />If one is looking for a well-written vampire story geared  towards the intelligent mind (and does not find this to be an oxymoron!),  then I strongly recommend I VAMPIRE - to start.

US	52480934	RJTTP5CW4GW97	0312148534	404425570	Rock Bottom: Dark Moments in Music Babylon	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Pamela once again proves herself as a historian!	A huge chunk of history of the 1960s would have been lost if Pamela des Barres hadn't written about her exploits in her two previous books. &quot;Rock Bottom : Dark Moments in Music Babylon&quot; isn't a sequel to  her autobiographies, however; it's a series of mini-biographies of some of  our dearly departed musicians.  Pamela manages to bring a personal aspect  to the interviews -- while maintaining her true image as a friendly face  and not a hanger-on.  The book is well-written and witty at times, even  though the deaths are heartbreaking. It's incredibly apropos that I  received the book as a gift from a dear friend who owns a record store! My  only slightly negative comment is that Pamela des Barres has never written  about the Grateful Dead in her books.  Her love of music isn't confined to  any one genre, and she was in the same area of the country at the same  time... I believe that Jerry's death was well before publication of this  book. I'm looking forward to another history by Pamela des Barres.  She  brings history to life, and makes it more fun than any of my high school  teachers ever did (no offense!) even when the stories are sad. Thanks for  writing the book :) Cordially, Rebekah Sue Harris	1999-03-24
