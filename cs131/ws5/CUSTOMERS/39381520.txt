She could do what Abby Knight did, which was buy a struggling flower shop in New Chapel, Indiana.  Seems like an odd choice given her background, but it makes her happy, and it keeps her in contact with people, many of whom could use some kind or other of legal advice.  What does it matter that she isn't qualified to dispense it along with her bouquets?  After all she's a cop's kid, so how can she resist aiding a woman and her son in leaving an abusive home or tracking down the jerk who crumpled her baby, a 1960 yellow ragtop Corvette, in a hit and run accident?<br /><br />  Too bad, though, she doesn't mind her own business after all.  It might help her to live longer, or so says pro private eye and ex-cop Marco Salvare, a man who can stand wearing leather in high heat and looks dangerous, albeit the good kind of dangerous, the kind that does things to a woman's knees.<br /><br />  Abby feels confident she can live through the taunts, threats, and hit and run accidents coming her way due to her inquisitive personality, but she just doesn't know how she can survive Marco's smug superiority and testosterone.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  The story was cute and funny, had a good plot line which entwined a lot of interesting threads, and although the mystery somewhat easy to figure out in some respects there were still twists that I didn't see coming.<br /><br />  The shop and its associates sounded darling.  I'd love to visit there for a cup of coffee.  I also enjoyed Simon the cat, though non-cat lovers might not feel the same.<br /><br />  Size-wise Abby is short and busty, but her friend Lottie is voluptuous. (However the story wasn't really as friendly to sizes larger than that.)<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  It wasn't an issue for me, but folks who don't care for first person point of view stories need to know that this series fits in that category.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  \\"Mum's the Word\\" is an enjoyable read and a fine debut for this new mystery series.<br /><br />~Another Opinion~<br /><br />from guest reviewer Alana Morales<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  The plot of this book was very well done. The twists and turns help things move along nicely, and it didn't end quite the way I expected it to. I liked that Abby kept sticking her nose into things--she never knows when to stop, which breaks from the norm. Most people will at some point learn their lesson.

This isn't a pro-plus size book, but it was nice to read about a woman who is short, since I am too.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  Once I realized that this was not a plus size heroine, it was fine.

A guest review by Lara Frater<br /><br />Hero: abundant<br /><br />  Jules Duchon is a 450lb vampire who has been haunting New Orleans for over a century.  Feasting on the blood of the people who eat the richest foods, it has given Jules a craving for them.  Jules is living life normally, driving his cab, picking up people he hopes no one will miss and listening to his priceless jazz collection.  Things take a turn for the worst when Malice X, a black vampire, decides that not only is New Orleans his but wants Jules to stick to white victims only. Jules must find ways to fight Malice X and enlists the aid of his old friend and former sidekick a transvestite named Doodlebug, and the woman who made him  a vampire, Maureen a very large stripper.<br /><br />   In the process he finds a strength he never knew was hidden in his bulk.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  The humor in this book is outstanding.  Jules is NOT your typical vampire.  He is not a goth boy with blond hair like Lestat. He's not smart or sophisticated.  Some of his ideas about defeating Malice X and dieting are hilarious (including drinking the blood of health nuts to lose weight).  Fat White Vampire Blues is careful not to be racist by having a good black character, Jules' friend Erato be a counterbalance for Malice X.<br /><br />  Size-wise there were many larger characters, but this was not always a good thing. See below.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  The women in this book suck. I really hated Maureen the main big girl in the book. Despite being the oldest vampire in the book, she is needy, whiny and weak.  She complains that Jules is fat while she herself as big as him.  Veronika, a side character, a crazy plus size model is only obnoxious and unmemorable (I nearly forgot her when I wrote this review.)<br /><br />  Even though Jule's fat becomes useful to him, he still is a stereotypical fat person, an out of control eater who fails on every diet.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  This is a fun read if you can overlook some of the characters and the political incorrectness.ypical fat person, an out of control eater who fails on every diet. <br />        <br />Overall: <br />             This is a fun read if you can overlook some of the characters and the political incorrectness.   <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-01

However it moves quickly past a lot of the basics that the older but still relevant \\"The Official Cheerleaders Handbook\\" covers in depth in terms of jump variety, basic stunts, and correct motion technique.<br /><br />In its favor:<br /><br />*Good section on how to approach and land a jump complete with pictures.<br /><br />*This is the book to have for learning intermediate and advanced stunts, both all-girl and co-ed. Covers thigh stands, various load-ins for preps and extensions, moves to hit at the top of the stunt, transitions, and dismounts. (Also includes collegiate level single base coed stunts.)

As a plus-size woman working in public relations, she's painfully aware of how image is everything.  Which is why Kat, a size 18 but wanna-be-4 so that she can finally meet her English online Romeo, is considering signing onto a weight loss reality show like \\"From Fat to Fabulous\\". It would be publicly humiliating, but also inspirational, right? And she'll have a forum for speaking out on the issues that the plus-size woman faces. And anyway, the prize money would make up for any degradation she might suffer, as would snagging Nick and living the perfectly-happy-ever-after life she's been daydreaming about.<br /><br />  But of course nothing goes to plan and Kat finds herself in a power struggle with food, her housemates, and that hunky boyfriend. Can a change in dress size truly bring her the happiness she longs for?<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  This story was right on about the thin clothes hiding in the back of the closet, and contained many other salient points about being a heavyset woman.<br /><br />  Kat has good taste in books; I, too, love Steph Plum and know what she means about not being able to put pen to paper and automatically (and painlessly) channel Janet Evanovich.<br /><br />  I think I would have experienced feelings similar to Kat's about being on a show of that sort.  Actually, I don't think I could take the fishbowl experience, but it was interesting to read about what life on a reality show set might be like from the comfort of my own private home.<br /><br />  Size-wise Kat starts out fairly abundant but whittles herself down to a plumpish average.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  I enjoyed it, but not everyone is wild about first person point of view.<br /><br />  Men who think that size 8 is \\"really pushing it\\" and that size ten is \\"way too fat for [their] taste\\" just make me crazy.

It is still, in my estimation, the best book for a beginning cheerleader to have because it has:<br /><br />*Stretches which are still helpful.<br /><br />*A tremendous variety of jump examples, more-so than any other book I have seen, including the C/window, & stag.  Also starts with the tuck as the most basic jump rather than the toe touch.

(Broken wrists, fly-away arms, uneven shoulders)<br /><br />*Simple, basic partner stunts best suited for beginner cheerleaders who need to learn the step-lock method (at a supervised practice, of course.) Pony mount, Knee/Standing tabletop, Side sit, 'Bama sit, single based thigh stand variations, victory mount, star, flying angel, and stag catch. Their tallest stunt is a shoulder stand.  No prep level or higher stunts are taught in this book, but there are pictures of some taller pyramids, a few of which are still legal.<br /><br />*Good sample dance 8 counts, though a bit out of date for the Hip-hop age.  But perfect if you have a marching band.<br /><br />*Small section on basic tumbling, but smartly suggests that cheerleaders seek out qualified instructors to learn from.<br /><br />*Several pages of cheers and chants: basic spirit, football, basketball, and wrestling<br /><br />My advice? Beginning cheerleaders need this book.  Intermediate and advanced cheerleaders might find it useful only if they want to consider finding ways to update some old school moves and look a little different from everyone else who attended summer camp with them.<br /><br />My idea of an excellent cheering how-to library consists of this book, plus \\"The Ultimate Guide to Cheerleading\\" and \\"Coaching Cheerleading Successfully\\".<br /><br />Coach ~Jente Guide to Cheerleading\\" and \\"Coaching Cheerleading Successfully\\".

Araminta has a soft heart for the less fortunate because of her gentle mother and cannot ignore the plight of a person in need, especially the young woman who so reminds her of her mother. The situation is escalating rapidly, and Araminta fears for her friend's safety.  She finds an unlikely ally in Griffin Calverson, the brother of her friend and former employee, Timona (the heroine of Rothwell's previous novel Somebody Wonderful).  She is not exactly eager to seek out the help of the cold as ice, but devastatingly attractive businessman with a reputation of being dangerous to those who cross him.  But she knows that she needs to fight fire with fire.  Although Kane is a long-time enemy of him and his business associates, Griffin is motivated to help the fiery and voluptuous chef for more personal reasons.  He figures the closer he gets to her, the easier it will be to seduce her into his bed, where he can exorcise himself of his obsession with her.  What starts as a light flirtation as they join forces to help the young woman who is hiding secrets about her past, becomes a struggle not to fall in love.  Love between a chef of mixed race and an aristocratic businessman is not a good idea, but it blossoms as they spend more and more time together.  But if they want to spend their lives together, they have to conquer their lifelong fears about giving into their love for each other.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  I enjoyed this book because I love stories with an interracial spin.  I also liked the feisty heroine who takes charge of her life despite all the obstacles that she has faced.  I enjoyed her tendency to be a mother hen, and the fact that she has not become bitter despite the prejudice that she has faced. The descriptions of the food that she prepares are vivid and mouthwatering, giving a believability to her being a chef.  The hero is also very charming and has a vitality that leaps off the page at the reader.  He comes off as being a man of contrasts:  born upper-class and very polite, but with an inner fire and dangerous edge that is very appealing.  From the beginning the reader than see that Araminta is very special to Griffin although he started out wanting her to be his mistress.  He always showed respect and caring for her, and embraced her racial heritage instead of looking down at it.  There is also an interesting supporting cast of characters that add to the vividness of the story, including a rough-edged bodyguard who is smitten with Araminta.<br /><br />  Size-wise Araminta was described by Griffith as having \\"the voluptuous hourglass figure of a Bowery actress\\".<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  I felt that the suspense thread could have been a little more compelling.  It seemed very thin although it did lend credibility to the reappearance of the main characters in each others' lives.  It may have been intentional but I found Olivia annoying and somewhat prejudiced in her attitude towards Araminta, who was going out of her way to befriend and help her.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  It was an enjoyable read with interesting characters who won me over.  I especially liked Araminta for her feisty, passionate, and caring nature.  Griffin was very appealing and sexy, and I enjoyed watching him fall desperately in love with Araminta despite his efforts to the contrary.  I enjoyed the cross-cultural romantic aspects as well. I would give it an A-.<br /><br />Warning: Issues of racism are touched on in a very light but realistic manner.  I found this to be refreshingly honest.

In another we find a gal at the beginning of a new adventure in her life when she moves to an island paradise near Lake Michigan. Let's just say the pilot of her flight plays a key role in her future. Still another interesting tale involves two people who meet in their apartment building laundry room of all places. (I've always heard doing laundry is a great way to meet men, now that idea is truly validated for me.) As the collection continues more romance blossoms between an artist and an admirer not just after her art, and sparks are rekindled between two old friends. The final fable in the book about an office costume party is a delightful surprise because it is a collaboration by all of the authors.<br /><br />  What worked for me:<br /><br />  This anthology was truly a great read. I enjoyed the stories, some more than others, but all were intriguing and inventive.<br /><br />  I loved the fact that the women were strong and independent. When the men came into their lives, it enhanced them but none of the ladies were desperate to meet a man. Moreover, these women were comfortable with themselves and felt worthy of love. That was especially important since most of the women had had previously serious relationships. I felt that the book sent the message that women should be happy with or without a man and when you find love it just enriches what is hopefully an already good and happy life.<br /><br />  Size-wise the women are comfortable in their own skin. The fact that they are fuller figured is a focus point of the book, but not that big of a deal to the women themselves. I, however, was pleased that the women varied in size and shape. All of them were plus-sized but there was diversity within their voluptuousness.<br /><br />  What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  I wanted more.

It's short and sweet and reads like a made-for-TV movie aimed at the teen crowd, complete with a mystery, big trouble, and happily-ever-after ending.  <br /><br />  We first meet 18 year old Freshman Sandra Reese as she is waiting in line to receive her dorm room assignment. Her inner monologue makes it painfully clear how she feels about herself.  The more uptight she feels about her appearance to others, the klutzier she becomes.  The klutzier she becomes, the more uptight she feels.  It's a vicious cycle, and one that all people can relate to.  Fortunately for her, she discovers she has the most amazing and loving roommate, Danny, who is instrumental in turning Sandra around in her thoughts and feelings about herself.  The story has a doubly happy ending for our heroine who finds love not only with her hero, but also with herself.<br /><br />  What worked for me:<br /><br />  I could relate to Sandra's feeling about herself; the way she made herself invisible, while at the same time complaining that no one really ever saw her.  And the way she believed that no guy, let alone a truly handsome one would ever want a girl like her was also a point that hit home for me.<br /><br />  I won't write the hero's name here and give away the story (there was a choice to be made between two guys at one point) but I enjoyed the way he bolstered Sandra's self-esteem and tried to make her understand that he thought she was a stunningly gorgeous and sexy young woman.<br /><br />  Side note: The Mom in this story drove me nuts!  I wanted to send her to therapy with a note tacked to her forehead that read, \\"I think I am a loving helpful Mom, but am actually tearing my kid apart.\\"   <br /><br />What didn't work for me:    <br /><br />  This story was very short, which didn't leave a lot of room for plotline and character development.  The story is mainly moved forward by dialogue, one of the reasons it felt script-like for me.  The other reason it felt script-like actually has nothing to do with the story itself, but the fact that this was my first time reading a book on my computer, and the long vertical, single-page format gave me the feeling of reading a play.  (I will miss the wonderfully musty smell of books dredged off the shelves of a used book store, but I realize that it is time for me to be dragged kicking and screaming into the new millennium. :^D  )<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  It was a fun, fast read for me.  I'm used to longer historical novels, so reading a novella with a contemporary setting was a nice change of pace.

The other reason it felt script-like actually has nothing to do with the story itself, but the fact that this was my first time reading a book on my computer, and the long vertical, single-page format gave me the feeling of reading a play.  (I will miss the wonderfully musty smell of books dredged off the shelves of a used book store, but I realize that it is time for me to be dragged kicking and screaming into the new millennium. :^D  ) <br /> <br />Overall: <br /> <br />   It was a fun, fast read for me.  I'm used to longer historical novels, so reading a novella with a contemporary setting was a nice change of pace.

The First Fat Fiction Anthology	Books	3	7	8	N	N	5 stars for the poetry, 2 for the stories	A guest review by Lara Frater<br /><br />Heroines:  varied<br /><br />  31 stories and poems that have something to do with being fat by such authors as Frederick Busch, Junot Diaz, Jill McCorkle, Katherine Riegel, Rebecca Curtis, Donna Jarrell, and Raymond Carter.<br /><br />  What worked for me:<br /><br />  This book is only worth it for the poetry. So check out \\"Full Figure\\" by Allison Joseph, \\"Nouveau Big\\" by Katherine Riegel, \\"For the Man who likes my Thighs\\" by Denise Duhamel, and \\"When Fat Girls Dream\\" by J. L. Haddaway. These poems show the suffering and joy of fat women. The only short story that was interesting and somewhat fat positive was \\"The Displaced<br /><br />Overweight Homemaker's Guide to Finding a Mate\\", and that was saved only by its humor.<br /><br />  Size-wise only the poems seemed to praise plus-sized people.<br /><br />  What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  Where do I start? With the exceptions of the entries listed above, most of the stories portray fat women and men as lazy, obsessed, out of control eaters, neurotic, and they could only lose weight and be happy if they received counseling and really tried.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  I recommend borrowing the book and not buying it. (Or perhaps getting it used.) The poems are much more positive than the short stories, but there just aren't enough of them.<br /><br />  If you liked \\"What are You Looking at?\\" you might also enjoy the \\"Love at Large\\", \\"Living Large\\" or \\"At Long Last, Love!\\" anthologies.	2004-11-17

Bryson<br /><br />Heroine: Average<br /><br />  By day, Ellie Levine is a middle-level designer's assistant on Seventh Avenue. By night, Ellie is a single mother living with her Grandfather in Queens, still neighbors with the people she's known her whole life. Independent in her vintage fashion and career determination, Ellie is stylish, educated, and witty. She is also resigned to staying in Richmond Hill, since she can't afford to move her family to the city, and really, deep down, home is where all her childhood friends and neighbors are.<br /><br />  Themes of motherhood, fatherhood, truth and honesty, friendship and romantic love, and a whopping dose of city chic add up to a second-chance romance, difficult relationship choices, and a surprising career path. Despite an edgy and sarcastic voice, Ellie is sincere and shows integrity of<br /><br />character-although it doesn't spare her from getting caught in a web of well-intended deception with her two best friends. Karen Templeton writes about single motherhood, a young woman's creative ambitions, and romantic confusion while balancing the everyday ordinary reality of Queens with the fantastic flash of New York City. Ellie's life drastically changes, and change certainly isn't always easy.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  Ellie's voice and her relationship with her daughter are endearing, as is her satisfying tendency to fight back when pushed. Compassionate and normal, she is the perfect heroine to root for as she faces the issues of both the big city and the close-knit community.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:    <br /><br />  My only real beef with this book is that Red Dress Ink opted for a stick-insect cartoon heroine on the cover, when Ellie describes herself on the first page, in the first paragraph, as \\"short, pudgy,\\" not able to fit into a size 8 by a long shot and short enough to eschew flats forever. As she puts it, \\"without heels, I look like I'm standing in a hole.\\"<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />       Red Dress Ink has published another great addition to the Chick Lit genre.<br /><br />  Warning: Readers should be aware that this is not a cotton candy coated romance. Characters deal with hard issues from dealing with affairs and unwanted pregnancy to sexual molestation between five-year-olds. The situations are not clean cut and the characters face difficult decisions, which add to quality and reality of this novel, but may not meet all Chick Lit fans' expectations.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Hanging by a Thread\\" you might also enjoy \\"Lucia, Lucia\\", \\"Separation Anxiety\\", \\"Love at Large\\", \\"Inappropriate Men\\", \\"Coffee and Kung Fu\\", \\"What a Girl Wants\\", \\"Blushing Pink\\", \\"Getting Over It\\", \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\", \\"Good in Bed\\", \\"Last Chance Saloon\\", \\"Jemima J.\\" and \\"Having It and Eating It\\".ook like I'm standing in a hole.\\" <br /> <br />Overall: <br /> <br /> Red Dress Ink has published another great addition to the Chick Lit genre.  <br /> <br />       Warning: Readers should be aware that this is not a cotton candy coated romance.

Heroine: plump/voluptuous<br /><br />  Sophie Greenway has fought hard to put her past as the wife of a strict religious leader behind her, painful though it was to lose custody of her young son in the process. So she is more than a little disturbed when she finds that the family hotel is now hosting a convention of her former denomination, the Church of the Firstborn.  But she welcomes contact with some of her old college roommates, other girls who had been sequestered in the campus' fat farm dorm.  Sadly, though, not all of her chums are present, as one passed away during their time at Purdis Bible College.<br /><br />  But Sophie's reunion is marred by murder, and the heinous crime throws the death of their classmate many years before in a new light.  Suddenly there is a conspiracy afoot, and Sophie no longer knows who she can trust.  One of the women she long counted as a friend may well indeed be a killer, and Sophie herself may be the next victim.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  I felt the mystery was the best part of this book, for despite having a fairly transparent opening it was difficult to be sure who the killer was.<br /><br />   <br /><br />         Size-wise Sophie was voluptuous as a girl.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  The writing was uneven, breezing along in some spots and lurching through others. And for some readers it might feel a bit soap-boxy, but the message resonated with me, both on the issue of big girls and oppressive religions.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  Worth the read for die-hard fans of the Sophie Greenway series.<br /><br />Warning: there is some coarse language in these books, and discussions as well as religious insights that might offend some people.<br /><br />If you liked \\"The Oldest Sin\\" you might also enjoy the Tory Bauer mystery series, the Odelia Grey mystery series, the Southern Sisters mystery series, the Josephine Fuller mystery series, \\"Death by Dessert\\", \\"Lady Blue\\", \\"Teacher's Pet\\", or \\"Love by the Pound\\".es,\\"Death by Dessert\\",\\"Lady Blue\\", \\"Teacher's Pet\\", or \\"Love by the Pound\\".	2004-10-11

A guest review by Danielle Hill<br /><br />Heroine: abundant<br /><br />  Bride McTierney thought she would never recover from her broken heart when her long-term boyfriend tossed her aside because her plus-sized physique didn't fit his upwardly mobile lifestyle. Not until two-legged wolf Vane Kattalakis seduced away her tears, anyway. She treasured the experience as a sweet memory to ease her pain, thinking he was just hers for one night. But her connection with Vane is destined to last a lifetime, at least for him.<br /><br />  It turns out that the most beautiful woman that Vane Kattalakis has ever laid eyes on, a human woman at that, is his bride-to-be whether he likes it or not. And he has but six weeks to convince her to become his true mate, or he will spend the rest of his very long life neutered.  For Vane is a Katagaria, a wolf who can take the form of a mortal--and a powerful one at that. But he has enemies that he must protect the sweet, vulnerable and sexy Bride from until she decides whether or not to take him as her mate for eternity.<br /><br />  Vane only hopes that he can keep himself from falling in love with her as he struggles to keep her alive.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  \\"Night Play\\" has snappy dialogue, enough humor to induce boisterous laughter, and enough angst to drive you to tears. The dangerous situations that the characters find themselves in make you hold your breath, and the power of the love story causes your heart to beat faster. Vane is a sexy, tortured hero with enough taste to appreciate a real woman in Bride. He is tender and possessive and completely captivated with her. She is sweet and likeable, a woman you would want to be friends with in real life.  The sex scenes are very sensual but also emotional, serving to strengthen the connection between Bride and Vane. I loved how there was no question that he found her to be very sexy.<br /><br />  \\"Night Play\\" also has some really great secondary characters, some of which are old friends from the previous books in the Dark Hunter series. Kenyon also introduces new characters that definitely show their capability of carrying their own novels in the future.<br /><br />  I also really enjoyed the deft way in which Kenyon played out dysfunctional family dynamics and agonies with a uniquely dangerous edge. Vane's family really doesn't get along, to the point that they want him dead. His mother actually nearly beat him to death when he was a helpless puppy because of her hatred for his father. You hurt for him that he truly feels alone except for his brother Fang, who languishes in a coma. His family troubles truly put my own into perspective. You want Vane to find happiness and tenderness with Bride, little of which he has had in his long life.<br /><br />  Size-wise Bride is a bona fide size eighteen, and Vane sees her as the most beautiful woman in the world.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  There was nothing about this book that wasn't done right. I hated to see it end.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  I can't sing this novel's praises enough. If you want to read an excellent story full of unforgettable characters, sizzling sex, and humor, with a sexy hero and beautiful plus-sized heroine, you've got to go out and grab this one.<br /><br />  If you liked \\"Night Play\\" you might also enjoy the Halloween reading list or one of the other wonderful Dark Hunter series installments that reveal the intriguing world of the Were-Hunter.<br /><br />Warning: Spicy (but tasteful) love scenes, and there are some descriptions of violence that might stir the mild-mannered reader. Play\\" also has some really great secondary characters, some of which are old friends from the previous books in the Dark Hunter series.

A guest review by Danielle Hill<br /><br />Heroine: voluptuous<br /><br />   <br /><br />  Lorelei, Baroness Winters, has made an art of making sure that others' hurtful words cannot penetrate the cheerfully flamboyant, careless shell she has constructed around herself. All her life she has dealt with cutting remarks about her large size to the point that she makes a joke of it before anyone else can. She had made herself indispensable to the members of the ton as confidant to women and boon companion to the men although she hears every spiteful word that they say about her behind her back.<br /><br />  But the time has come for her to marry, even if it isn't for love. She has settled on a lord who's much more interested in hunting and his horses so there is no chance of him breaking her heart. Enter the American Adrian Rutland, newly appointed Viscount Dane, who is in need of an English bride so that his family can gain the respectability that it lacks. He takes one look at the tall, voluptuous Baroness and knows that she is meant to be his Viscountess. He simply has to convince the vulnerable Lorelei of that fact.<br /><br />  Lorelei is literally swept off her feet by the brash, intelligent and undeniably attractive American, although deep down she doubts that he could ever be captivated by her.  So she is shocked when he comes up to scratch with an offer for her.  Lorelei is now faced with a dilemma. Should she marry for convenience, or for love--even with the risk of heartbreak that it entails?<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />   This book was a pleasure to read from the first sentence. As a woman who has always been tall and curvy, I could totally identify with Lorelei. She's a wonderful character who has learned to make the most of herself and has had to deal with the loneliness and isolation inherent in her position. Byron makes her vulnerabilities heartbreakingly apparent to the reader despite her formidable strength of character. I love it that there is a man who is made for her in Adrian. He takes one look at her and he sees the most beautiful woman in the world and decides that he's going to have her. He never strays in his devotion, despite the fact that there are times when Lorelei's insecurities must be very frustrating. This book is a love story in the truest sense. The main characters' feelings are rich even at the beginning, and they only deepen as the book progresses.<br /><br />  Size-wise Adrian's first view of Lorelei inspires these thoughts: \\"She had to be over six feet tall, and her figure...She was a veritable hourglass of feminine curves, though on an ample scale, with full breasts and wide hips separated by a thicker-than-acceptable curve of waist...In his eyes, she was beauty and grace. A real woman, rather than merely female.\\"<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  Nothing was a problem for me in this novel. I found it beautiful in its simplicity. There are other elements, but the crux of the book never strays for the wonderful love story that Eve Bryon tells.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  Only in My Dreams is a wonderful book that almost brought tears to my eyes. The love story about two souls who were made for each other and find completion in each other is pure and touching.<br /><br />Warning: The sensuality is subtle but stirring. There was nothing in this book that would offend except that Lorelei's contemporaries take her for granted and make rude comments about her weight and height. It made me angry on her behalf.<br /><br />If you liked \\"Only in my Dreams\\" you might also enjoy \\"Somebody to Love\\", \\"Slightly Wicked\\", \\"Miss Carlyle's Curricle\\", \\"Into Temptation\\", \\"Suddenly You\\", \\"The Accidental Bride\\", \\"The Bride and the Beast\\", \\"The Fire-Flower\\", \\"The Last Days of a Rake\\", \\"Cat and the Countess\\", \\"The Courtship\\", or \\"Enchanting Pleasures\\".ere is a man who is made for her in Adrian.

And now, she's going to have a baby.<br /><br />  Not wanting to ruin her `girl next door' modeling campaign, she determines that she has one choice--to marry the baby's father.  The problem?  He lives over one thousand miles away and they haven't spoken since their passionate weekend in Monte Carlo.<br /><br />  When Jodie flies to Texas, she plans to get sexy architect Travis Whitaker to agree to a temporary marriage to save her career.  Unfortunately for her, Travis has already made other plans, in the form of a vow to never get married again.  Ever.  But that was before his impending fatherhood.  Now he wants to do things up right.<br /><br />  And Jodie quickly discovers that what she wants and what she gets are two very different things.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  This book was a fun read and a tasteful romance novel. Once I got into the story, I couldn't wait to read what happened next.  The characters were well developed and likable, and the dialogue was very believable with the exception of one or two scenes.<br /><br />  The author didn't waste the reader's time by bogging them down with irrelevant details.  There was just enough information given about extended characters to keep the story moving, but not make you wonder more about them. The setting was well described and when I read, I could see the places described in my mind.  Instead of being told where things were taking place, I could see it happen.<br /><br />  Size-wise Jodie is described as having a \\"sturdy and athletic build.\\"  She is described favorably by the hero many times and the fact that she is a model helps to show plus-sized women in a positive light.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  I would say that 98% of this book worked for me.

Seeing her parents divorce didn't leave a bad taste about marriage in her mouth.  And having her lover flee her didn't affect her in the least.  Not at all.<br /><br />  So when an attractive fellow American catches her eye on a trans-Atlantic flight, she's surprised and a bit suspicious that he'd hit on a bigger girl like herself, but decides that engaging in a little harmless flirtation to pass the time would be reasonable.  But she didn't count on falling hard for him during that overnight flight.  And Jack (think Owen Wilson meets Matthew McConaughey) was wonderful enough for her to reconsider the dating scene, right up until he dropped the other shoe.  He was in a relationship, albeit one he was about to end.<br /><br />  And what's even more distressing, Claire knows the girlfriend in question very well indeed.  She swears to herself that she will not get involved in the upcoming romantic mess, but she's so drawn to Jack that she just can't help it.  And before long she's entangled in a web of lies, deceit, and guilt.<br /><br />  What good is it to have a great new guy in your life if you can't actually talk about him and feel guilty for even knowing him?<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  I totally get Claire's interest in reading high-end home decor magazines and wanting not just the profiled homes but the lives of their owners.  I, too, wish I could be in a gourmet kitchen serenely washing baby arugula leaves, but my lifestyle and personality dictate that instead I lift my feet as kids and cats race under them while I give the iceberg lettuce a quick pass by swishing the core into the trash can, so be it.

Heroine: slender<br /><br /> Recently divorced from Arnez (a cheating, user, park Avenue cosmetic dentist), Joelle Sinclair has packed up her little red convertible and left behind her position as an events organizer for the Whitney art museum in the city for the Hamptons, playground of rich New Yorkers, and a chance at landing a job at Kenneth Oberlin's famous jewelry laden gallery.<br /><br /> It's not long before she attracts the notice of one Jabari Mitchell, partner in a Manhattan law firm, who approaches her with the most unusual request for a first date--purchase him in a charity bachelor auction.<br /><br /> Joelle is just learning to trust men again, but she can't help but wonder that by saying yes to the sexy and mysterious Jabari that she's repeating the same mistake twice. Or perhaps making a new one even worse than the first.<br /><br /> What worked for me:<br /><br /> Ms. Grosvenor writes very realistic dialogue, and I really enjoyed the banter between Joelle and Jabari. (And I gotta get me some ginger tangerine oil and convince my man to give me a foot massage like the one Jabari gave Joelle.)<br /><br /> I just loved the description of eccentric gallery owner Kenneth Oberlin. What an image!<br /><br /> Size-wise Joelle was quite slender but the story didn't really focus on that. (And since she just went through a divorce, one can say that being thin or beautiful doesn't really protect a woman from a cheating man. Especially a slug like Arnez, who couldn't put Joelle down fast enough when they ran into each other at a party.)<br /><br /> What didn't work for me:<br /><br /> I've said it before, I'll say it again. &quot;Ladies, don't jump into bed with a guy you don't know. Nine times out of ten you'll wind up regretting it.&quot; I feel pretty sure Joelle would agree with me on this.<br /><br /> This fairly short book had the potential to be one of those epic glitz novels. It might have been fun to have had a few more characters to fill it out and keep you guessing that much longer.<br /><br /> Overall:<br /><br /> What starts out as a chronicle of healing from a broken marriage takes on a twist of danger and intrigue. &quot;The Hamptons&quot; is sexy and thrilling, with a storyline that could easily play on Dominick Dunne's &quot;Power, Privilege, and Justice&quot;.<br /><br /> Warning: there are some sexual scenarios in this book.<br /><br /> If you liked &quot;The Hamptons&quot; you might also enjoy &quot;All of Me&quot;, &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, &quot;The High Price of a Good Man&quot;, &quot;Sisterhood Situation&quot;, &quot;Shadows in the Moonlight&quot;, or &quot;Commitments&quot;.re characters to fill it out and keep you guessing that much longer.  <br />  <br /> Overall: <br />  <br /> What starts out as a chronicle of healing from a broken marriage takes on a twist of danger and intrigue. &quot;The Hamptons&quot; is sexy and thrilling, with a storyline that could easily play on Dominick Dunne's &quot;Power, Privilege, and Justice&quot;.  <br />  <br /> Warning: there are some sexual scenarios in this book.  <br />  <br /> If you liked &quot;The Hamptons&quot; you might also enjoy &quot;All of Me&quot;, &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, &quot;The High Price of a Good Man&quot;, &quot;Sisterhood Situation&quot;, &quot;Shadows in the Moonlight&quot;, or &quot;Commitments&quot;.	2004-08-06

Bryson<br /><br /> Heroines: varied<br /><br /> A whole neighborhood of strong heroines reside in the Freesia Court suburb of Minneapolis. These ladies form the &quot;Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons&quot; book club in 1968 during a night of power-outages, impromptu snowball fights, and candle-lit cocktails. Loosely organized around the club's monthly book selections, readers follow the five women (Audrey, Faith, Slip, Merit, and Kari), and their families, through four decades.<br /><br /> All beautiful in their own ways, the women struggle with their personal issues of self-acceptance in the face of life's inevitable curve balls. Audrey, our voluptuous Angry Housewife, loves her body and her favorite topic for discussion is sex. It's her husband who suggests she'd feel better if she lost a little weight, and others who have trouble accepting her physical confidence in heels and miniskirts. \\"I feel fine about myself,\\" said Audrey, piling her thick dark hair on top of her head and posing like a pinup model. She liked her curvy body, ample seat, and full breasts. \\"And fine about my body.\\" For Slip, Audrey's best friend, not having curves, or even looking feminine, was always a problem. Merit, the sweetest and quietest of the friends, could win any beauty contest, hands-down, but struggles against her husband's efforts to squelch her every attempt at independence or creativity. Faith, the talented Southern belle with a knack for design, is not all she seems, and feels the pressure of always keeping a lid on her past. And finally, Kari, a widow who has wanted nothing more normal than a child to love, is the doting \\"Aunt\\" to every kid in her own family and the neighborhood.<br /><br /> What worked for me:<br /><br /> I love getting into the minds of strong women, finding our what they think about things that we all may encounter in our lives. This book offers five friends that offer their perspectives on just about anything that could happen to a person. Acceptance of one's self and of others, with some constructive forgiveness are the morals to every lesson.<br /><br /> The book also deals with the concept of parenthood, and, at age 27, I'm currently suffering through \\"baby fever\\" while my husband and I discuss our timeline for starting a human family (beyond the 2 cats and 2 dogs that are our children now).<br /><br />  <br /><br /> Size-wise, as noted a bove, there was a wide range of body shapes and sizes represented.<br /><br /> What didn't work for me:    <br /><br /> The first- and third-person points of view change with each chapter makes the narrative style feel a bit jumpy, and it is sometimes disappointing to be forced to leave a character at the end of a section. Of course, a positive ending is predictable, but that's what you usually expect from a warm and fuzzy story like this.<br /><br /> Overall:<br /><br />        This novel is a solidly written, feel-good read. Despite multiple narrators and plot threads, it is a straightforward story about a group of women and their lessons learned.<br /><br /> Warning: Be aware that Audrey's love of sex translates into allusions to intercourse and vocabulary words that my grandmother would pretend she's never heard. Stories of a Vietnam War soldier's experience are graphic and will disturb, unless you have no soul. The Angry Housewives also tackle the sensitive issues of homosexual acceptance and spousal abuse.<br /><br /> If you liked &quot;Angry Housewives Eating Bonbons&quot;, you might also enjoy &quot;The Saving Graces&quot;, &quot;Tara Road&quot;, &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;, &quot;Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman&quot;, and &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf&eacute;&quot;.on just about anything that could happen to a person.

Heroine: Stout, then willowy<br /><br /> At the ripe old age of 22, Allison Penny is already sick of life. Her alcoholic mother berates her at every possible chance. The young woman is barely making it as a cleaning lady. And she is rooming with a sex fiend who only serves to remind Allison that her own love life has always and will always be in the toilet because, in a word, Allison Penny is ugly. Well, two words. Not just ugly, but fat.<br /><br /> But all that changes one morning when Allison miraculously awakens to find herself in a new body, one that transcends the supermodel class. Yet after all those years of being certain that a new appearance would be the answer to the pain in her heart, Allison-the-beauty discovers that perfection personified isn't necessarily all that it's cracked up to be.<br /><br /> What worked for me:<br /><br /> This was a very funny book that took a tongue-in-cheek look at the realities of what a person's appearance means in the world--especially a woman's. The choice of characters and settings were excellent, even if they weren't always fully developed. They really helped the reader to delve into the subject of a caste system based upon personal beauty or lack thereof.<br /><br /> I felt that the author made it easy to relate to Allison, both before and after her &quot;miracle&quot;. I fully understood the need for Allison-the-ugly to run away into fantasyland and daydream the way she did. And I have to admit there was a certain pleasure to riding along with Allison-the-beauty during her payback times, but the vendettas I enjoyed most weren't a direct result of her new attractiveness.<br /><br /> The ly adverbs that popped up here and there kept catching my eye, but other than that I really enjoyed the writing style in this book. Some of the visuals that the author painted were just wonderful.<br /><br /> Size-wise, prior to turning into a living Barbie doll, Allison was squat, flat, and flabby with unattractive features all the way around. But not only females suffered from beauty discrimination in this novel. Allison's guy pal Nathan was overlooked many times because he was merely average in appearance.<br /><br /> What didn't work for me:    <br /><br /> There were times when reading this book left me feeling downright depressed, but I don't want to give anything away so I can't tell you why.<br /><br /> I would have liked to have had some concrete idea of why and how this change occurred in Allison.<br /><br /> Overall:<br /><br />        A great book for the bubble bath or beach, but there is plenty of deeper thinking here about the nuances of the human psyche that would make it a terrific subject for a women's studies discussion group.<br /><br /> Warning: there are some coarse words and some sexual scenarios, as well as weight loss, in this book.<br /><br /> If you liked &quot;Waking Beauty&quot; you might also enjoy &quot;Jemima J.&quot;, &quot;Fat Chance&quot;, &quot;Separation Anxiety&quot;, &quot;The Way It Is&quot;, &quot;Inappropriate Men&quot;, &quot;Coffee and Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot;, &quot;Getting Over It&quot;, &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot;, &quot;Good in Bed&quot;, &quot;Last Chance Saloon&quot;, and &quot;Having It and Eating It&quot;.ive features all the way around.

Heroine: tall/buxom<br /><br /> Who in her right mind would want to date 40 men in 60 days? Greeting card designer and shop owner Wollie Shelley, that's who. Because let's face it, there's not a lot of money in the card business when your shop is located on the seedy side of L.A. The $5000 payment for participating in the dating research study would mean the world to Wollie. And as an added bonus she reveres her new boss, radio personality Dr. Cookie Lahven, and is thrilled to be assisting her with gathering material for her new book, &quot;How to Avoid Getting Dumped All the Time&quot;.<br /><br /> But an attempt by Wollie to visit her mentally ill brother at a hospital puts a damper on the project in the form of a dead body. And Wollie is so worried that her brother might have had something to do with it that she avoids alerting the authorities. Instead, she allows herself to be kidnapped by an attractive man disguised as a doctor in the hopes that she can buy some time and solve the crime herself.<br /><br /> She crosses paths with so many bad guys along the way that she could pen her own guidebook, &quot;How to Avoid Getting Dumped--in a River by a Mobster&quot;.<br /><br /> What worked for me:<br /><br /> I genuinely liked Wollie and found her to be a sympathetic character. I liked her kidnapper too, and thought the sexual tension between them was a lot of fun. (The pet ferret was a nice touch as well.)<br /><br /> The writing style and humor might not appeal to everyone, but I sure got a kick out of them.<br /><br />          Size-wise Wollie was very tall and on the buxom side. (It's not often I run across a book where the romance pairs a taller woman with a shorter man.)<br /><br /> What didn't work for me:<br /><br /> I was disappointed that I didn't get to know Wollie's friends a bit better. I am hoping that they get more time on center stage in the next book.<br /><br /> I had some trouble keeping the various characters and plotlines straight at times.<br /><br /> Overall:<br /><br />           This breezy, quirky book should go straight to the beach with you.

Heroines: varied<br /><br /> In between working for BOOM magazine, maintaining her marriage to her unhealthy husband, and dealing with her cranky mother-in-law and should-be-flown-from-the-nest-but-aren't kids, Rochelle Fabrikant tells us about her friendship with her rock of Gibraltar, Gertrude, who one day suddenly rejects her lifelong role of &quot;the fat friend&quot;.<br /><br /> From the traumatic teen years to cresting the hill of middle age, Shell could always rely on who she was when she was with Tru. But now that Tru is redefining the lines of who she is, Shell learns that there is truth in the old idea that to have a friend one must be a friend.<br /><br /> What worked for me:<br /><br /> This book gave me a lot to ponder about the place of women in the western world, and though it could have come across as preachy I felt that for the most part the messages were well couched within the story.<br /><br /> The dynamics of the relationship between Shell and Tru, and how much they relied on Tru's weight, were fascinating. As her weight changed, their relationship changed, and Shell was forced to reevaluate her thoughts about her friend. (Which, in all honesty, is only sensible. No one should freeze frame their angst-ridden preteen mindset, not even toward their dearest friends.)<br /><br /> At the risk of gushing, I must say I just loved the ending, bittersweet though it was.<br /><br /> Size-wise Shell sounded to be on the comfortable side of average and Tru began the story as abundant.<br /><br /> What didn't work for me:<br /><br /> I had to agree with Shell when she queried Tru as to how she had all the details in the stories she related about various people. And with her pattern of speech, she sounded every bit as much the writer as Shell! (Some of those conversational vignettes seemed like they would work well in a stage play.)<br /><br /> The womyn's retreat, &quot;Even Song,&quot; seemed like something right out of a Margaret Atwood or Marion Zimmer Bradley story. Very intense, to say the least.<br /><br /> I'm not sure if I am just sensitive to the subject because of my personal history or the fact that I have read several stories along similar lines in the last year was lodged in my subconscious mind, but I figured out long before Shell what was really happening with her dear friend. What I am not so sure of is whether or not I was meant to do so.<br /><br /> Overall:<br /><br /> &quot;The Fat Friend&quot; was an interesting, thought-provoking read with a few laughs thrown in to lighten the mood of an otherwise heart wrenching story.<br /><br /> Warning: there are some coarse words, weight loss, and sexual references in this book.

While there she meets the duke's old friend Derek Harris, widowed earl's son and father of two precocious young children, who was hired by Grayson to renovate the manor and ferret out a missing antique lamp in the process.  Derek expresses concern to Emma that his old friend's estate is in terribly fine shape considering that his grace had been left in penury by the late duke.  In fact, the Hall and its nearby village appear to have undergone extensive expensive renovations in the very recent past.<br />  But where did the money come from?  Was it possible Grayson was dealing in illicit funds?  And did it have anything to do with Lex Rex, the punk rocker who met a tragic ending on the duke's yacht, and who turned out to have been penniless himself at the time of his death?<br />  Perhaps only Grayson's super-model cousin Susannah knows the answer, but she's not talking--at least not since an &quot;accident&quot; in the ruins of a nearby castle left her unconscious.<br />What worked for me:<br />  An avid gardener myself, I'm always keen to read a story that involves flowers.<br /><br />  The mystery kept me turning the pages, as did the sweet romance blossoming between Derek and Emma.<br />  I haven't tried it so can't vouch for it, but the strawberry tart recipe certainly sounds scrumptious.<br />         Size-wise Emma is full-figured, plump in her own eyes but deliciously curvy in her hero's.

But she's pretty certain she doesn't want to be defined by her lifelong friendship with best buddy Jonah LiaKos.  Increasingly worried, she decides to \\"break up\\" with Jonz (if such a thing can even be done) on the off chance that they are becoming the emotional equivalent of conjoined twins.<br />  But she picked a heck of a time to kick her support system out from under herself.  Her teen sister, along with her young Romeo, has decided to camp out in her apartment.  Their misery-inducing parents, the same ones from whom Cheetah also ran away as a teen, are haranguing her to bring the girl back.  And the return visit home only opens up painful new questions in Cheetah's mind and new holes in her heart.<br />  Toss in a one night stand that should never have happened and perverse angst over someone else snapping up Jonz now that she's tossed him away, Cheetah is in a constant state of frantic soul searching.<br />  Can she survive these growing pains? And will she be able to keep her family and friendships intact, or will they pass out of her life as she forges a new direction for herself?<br />What worked for me:<br />  Being in Cheetah's head was an exhausting but thought-provoking experience.  It was fascinating to relive her youth with her and then see the mature woman connect the dots of her history and reach an epiphany or two.  (And unlike some chick lit heroines, I didn't find Cheetah to be annoying.  I'd be glad to have a cup of coffee with her. )<br />  Every girl should have a Jonz!<br />  Maybe it was just the train tracks scene, but the story put me somewhat in mind of Stephen King's \\"Stand by Me\\".<br />  \\"Separation Anxiety\\" had a few predictable plot points, but there were enough unexpected twists and turns to keep me reading.  The story also had enough substance to it that I found myself still thinking about it days after I had closed the cover.  (In fact, there is a reader's guide at the back of the novel, but it doesn't really give any surprises away so some folks may enjoy looking over the questions as they read.)<br />  Size-wise Cheetah is sturdy like a \\"corn-fed farm girl\\", but this isn't an issue in the book.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Since the story is told from Cheetah's point of view we witness the relationship dynamics only through her eyes and therefore don't really achieve intimacy with the other characters except as Cheetah discovers more about them herself.  That can make for some frustrating moments for people who like everything to be laid out in third person, with time spent in each of the main characters' heads.<br />Overall:<br />  \\"Separation Anxiety\\" is a compelling tale of a young woman rearranging her view of the world.  Pop this must-read into your beach bag this summer, but don't expect to find breezy fluff between its covers as you while away the hours on the sand.<br />  Warning: there are some coarse words and a few references to sexual scenarios in this book.<br />If you liked \\"Separation Anxiety\\" you might also enjoy \\"Inappropriate Men\\", \\"Coffee and Kung Fu\\", \\"What a Girl Wants\\", \\"Blushing Pink\\", \\"Getting Over It\\", \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\", \\"Good in Bed\\", \\"Last Chance Saloon\\", \\"Jemima J.\\" and \\"Having It and Eating It\\".enough substance to it that I found myself still thinking about it days after I had closed the cover.

But Val, who was raised in a chain of foster homes, isn't sure she can provide what her new charge needs.<br />  George Richards was uncertain about hiring a complete stranger to care for his four year old daughter, even if she is a close friend of his brother and sister-in-law. And he certainly never expected that he would fall for this modern day June Cleaver who keeps his hectic life running like clockwork.<br />  But the closer George gets to Valerie, the more panicky she begins to feel, until one night she flees from his home and breaks the hearts of the people left behind.  Will she change her mind and return?  And will George be able to forgive her for running out on him, just like his ex had?<br />What worked for me:<br />  Ms. Allen's signature realistic characters fill the pages of this novel with their warmth and wit. And the storyline is both sweet and interesting.<br />  Size-wise Val was rounder than George's ex, but he liked her that way.<br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  There were a couple of technical issues in this story, but more than anything I noticed that we never got to see George at work, which I really would have liked to have seen.<br />  Also, it's just no fair leaving us readers without a neatly wrapped up ending.  Now we'll have to wait until the next book in the series to find out the truth about Val's family history!<br /><br />Overall:<br />  \\"Truth and Lies\\" is a sequel even stronger than the original story.  Fans of sexy short romance novels are sure to love this one!<br /> <br />Warning: Things do get a bit steamy in this book a few times.<br />If you liked \\"Truth and Lies\\" you might also enjoy: \\"The Legacy Tree\\", \\"Suite Seduction\\",  \\"Miracles\\", \\"A Worthy Heir\\", \\"Carried Away\\", \\"More to Love\\",  \\"His E-mail Order Wife\\",  \\"His Seductive Revenge\\", \\"Love by the Pound\\", \\"Tales from the Heart\\", \\"Teacher's Pet\\", or \\"Etta Mae's Little Theory\\".ew times.<br />If you liked \\"Truth and Lies\\" you might also enjoy: \\"The Legacy Tree\\", \\"Suite Seduction\\",  \\"Miracles\\", \\"A Worthy Heir\\", \\"Carried Away\\", \\"More to Love\\",  \\"His E-mail Order Wife\\",  \\"His Seductive Revenge\\", \\"Love by the Pound\\", \\"Tales from the Heart\\", \\"Teacher's Pet\\", or \\"Etta Mae's Little Theory\\".	2004-05-01

When the little something is her father's business partner!<br />  Thirty three year old Sidney Stein is stuck in a marriage that has fizzled out, with no chance at having its former sizzle rekindled.  So sassy Sidney latches onto the nearest opportunity for spice in her life, an attentive older man from her father's firm.  At first she has no trouble with playing it cool in public, pulling the wool over her husband's eyes, and dodging Geoff's wife at social events.  But is sneaking her lover in and out of her house in the dead of night any life for a self-respecting modern gal?  When she breaks her own \\"how to have an affair\\" rule about not letting her heart get involved, Sidney becomes convinced that it is not.<br />  Making a clean break from her husband, Sid is nudged by her pal Parker into dating others, as he points out that it is only fair since her \\"bit on the side\\" is juggling two women of his own: her and wifey.  Yet despite posting a clever personal ad, Sid despairs of finding the man who could make dumping her secret lover seem worthwhile, or even a single guy who could qualify as \\"normal\\".  Instead, she seems to attract every misfit, jerk, and creep in the greater Chicago area.<br />  And when Prince Charming finally does appear on her doorstep, Sidney is completely unprepared for him.  What was Fate thinking?<br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  I am not generally a fan of bed hopping or affair stories, I think because I am a wife and I take that sort of thing a bit personally.  However, I found that it worked in this novel because Sid is just so real.  We suffer right along with her when she realizes the mess she has gotten herself into.<br />  The book's format can be a bit dizzying until you get used to it: what's happening now, flashbacks, and asides all mingled with some fabulous poetry. But everything comes together to make for a really rich storytelling.<br />  The recipes included in this book look like they are out of this world.  If only I was a competent cook!  (And kudos to the author for mentioning Nigella when bringing up the culinary arts. Is there a lovelier chef to be found anywhere on TV?)<br />  I never knew that particular fact about pineapple juice, though I did hear the opposite about coffee. (And no, I won't explain this further, but I bet you will remember this note when you read about it in the book.)<br />  Size-wise Sid was short and fat--a very round and sexy size 24 and unapologetic about it.  She certainly had no trouble securing dates.<br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  Oh, I admit it.  I am terrible about skimming forward in books to find out what happens, so I didn't take the time to savor much of the poetry.<br />  There is a nightmare of a sex scene in this book.

Her erstwhile almost-lover then bets notorious womanizer Calvin Morrissey $10,000 that Cal can't charm her into bed within a month.  But beware a woman scorned!  Min's onto their scheme and figures she can string handsome Cal along and get a meal or two, a date for that darn wedding, and the last laugh out of their little game.<br />  Trouble is, her heart, or at least her loins, tell her she wants this guy for real, but her so-sensible mind points out that nice \\"white-cotton-panty-and-bra-set\\" girls do not--can not--keep this kind of Adonis for life.  And wager aside, the odds are stacked against their making it in the long term:  He's beautiful; she's not. He's all charm, she's no-nonsense. He's triple fudge, she's plain vanilla. And don't even get them started on which Elvis is better.<br />  But will common sense win out over their hearts' desires?  Don't bet on it.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  I thought this story was sweet and funny and felt like a Meg Ryan movie.  And while some readers might feel like the plot was contrived in spots, I myself was fine with that for the most part.  After all, keeping the hero and heroine out of each other's arms only raises the stakes and the tension.<br />  I, too, know the heartache of trying and failing to make Chicken Marsala \\"heart smart\\". Just can't be done.<br />  I don't want to give it away, but the epilogue made this particular curvy gal smile. It was perfect for the reader who requires her story be tied up in a neat little package with a perfect bow.<br />  Size-wise Min is very voluptuous, like an old 50s pinup and then some. I love that Cal loved her curves and stood up for her, reassuring Min that she could both be beautiful and eat bread and butter.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I was so hungry after reading this book!<br />  What parents these people had.  Poor Cal and Min!

I am glad I read this book.  I think it has helped to redirect my search for God and to help me rebuild my faith in Him, so that I move from a fearful relationship with an angry Supreme Master to one with a loving Supreme Parent.<br />I first read the Bible cover-to-cover on my own as a youngster.  This was probably not a good thing, as I mostly came away with an impression of an Angry God.  And I certainly was in no position to understand at the tender age of 11 the cultural background of the world of the Hebrews or Jesus.<br />The trouble is that in some ways reading about the life of Christ is a bit like reading a mystery. Sure you can read the book again, but you already know whodunit the next time you go back to it, and having that knowledge changes the way you see things from then on.  \\"Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time\\" has clarified for me the difference between pre-Easter and post-Easter Jesus.  Before this when I reread the Gospels and looked over what Jesus said or did prior to his death and resurrection, I looked at it as though He was the post-Easter Godly Jesus the entire time, that He was always God right from the get-go.  Now I am looking at Him more in the sense of His humanity as it was recorded in the first 3 gospels. When I stop to think about it, I expect He was a pretty normal kid, and I am not sure that He really saw Himself as God as that point waiting around to be worshipped. Rather I do think He was very much a man constantly in touch with His Father, so I am giving more consideration to the example He set where he showed me how to live and how to be in touch with the Father all the time. (Or at least try to be.)<br />Also, as a woman who was raised in a Baptist church, I was always hurt and angry at the way women seemed to be second class citizens, and folks always seemed to back up the reason for this with Scripture. But Borg's book showed me that there was a possibility that God has a feminine side (His Wisdom or Sophia) and that this idea of femininity was dropped in translations made from the Greek texts.  Perhaps that does not mean much to some, but to a girl who heard most of her life how everything was Eve's (and therefore women in general) fault, it meant a lot to me.<br />I also appreciated Borg's information about purity codes and particularly about how Jesus confronted the Pharisees about their mile long lists of who was ok and who was not and how badly they treated those on the \\"not ok\\" list.  I can see that this type of thinking is still present in many churches today, which is too bad. A relationship with God should not be about following rules, rules, and more rules but rather about his Grace. I wish I had known this years ago, so that I might have actually _felt_ God before now.<br />So I would recommend this book to people who feel that they are just going through the motions at church (or have given up on church altogether) but could use some fresh insight to get their search for God jumpstarted again.  It's also good for folks who are just starting out on the path of Biblical scholarship.  However, people who believe the Bible is inerrant may be uncomfortable with some of the ideas presented in this book. It doesn't mean they should not pick it up, but they should be forewarned that they may find their beliefs tested.his idea of femininity was dropped in translations made from the Greek texts.

Or at least it does for Haley Jane Smith, who is surrounded by some very unhygienic coworkers.  She didn't even notice the funky odor wafting over from the adjacent cubicle, where fellow copywriter Fred Leary had died unnoticed--until Haley made a fateful visit to his side of the dividing wall.<br />  And things can only go downhill from there, as a shocked Haley Jane bumbles her way from one bad decision to the next:  feeling up the investigating police officer; asking for a raise but getting fired; and asking for support from her Girlie Brunch bunch, which lands her an appointment with an unusual new age guidance guru, as well as the starring role in her best friend's thesis on human sexuality.  If only Haley Jane's well-meaning friends could actually make good on their intentions to coach her through her man hunt and job search, maybe she could wind up with both the hunky cop and the career of her dreams!<br />  Then again, knowing those girls, maybe not.<br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  There was plenty of humor in this story, along with some terrific (and sometimes hot) twists in the plot.  I'm not sure if the author has plans to do so, but the door was left open to revisit this fun group of gals at a later date.<br />  Size-wise the girls were varied. The main character, petite Haley Jane, didn't have size issues per se, but she did entertain fantasies of being a stacked, blonde, sharp shooting Amazonian member of Mensa.  Perhaps it had to do with the Bavarian bar maid's outfit she wore in one scene, but Haley Jane took on a decided Sandra Bullock-like appearance in my imagination. (Think \\"Miss Congeniality here.)<br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  There were a couple of scenes I could have lived without, and the writing could have been more polished.

Heroine: plump/average<br /><br />  A size activist is unshakeable in her convictions, right? That's what &quot;Fat Chance&quot; columnist Maggie O'Leary thought as she championed well-padded people everywhere, answering their heartbreaking letters with all the compassion she could muster.   But that was before Hollywood snatched her up and turned her inside out and upside down.<br />  When Maggie receives a phone call from heart throb Mike Taylor she's ready to dismiss it as a prank played by one of her coworkers.  But she learns that it's the real deal and her once lonely, now star struck heart leads her to accept a job as Mike's technical advisor, who is in charge of giving him the lowdown on food issues and eating disorders for his role as a diet doc.<br />  Maggie has just two months before she gets to play tutor to the hunk and is frantic at the thought of meeting him as her frumpy self.  A little exercising here, eating carefully there, highlights, chin suctioning.  It's no big deal, she's just improving on who she is, right?<br />  Once in California, Maggie's head is caught up in the whirlwind of the Tinsel town high life and her heart is becoming more and more lost to the amiable Taylor by the minute.  But her readers can feel a difference in her columns, which increasingly focus on how to eat and exercise sensibly, and Maggie finally has to face reality when paparazzi pictures of her posing with the silver screen stud completely blow her cover.  The queen of queen-sized now barely rates as the princess of plump.<br />  So Maggie is in a quandary.  What does she want?  Life in a thinner body with Michael Taylor in Hollywood?  To be large and living in New York near her aging mother?  And while she's agonizing over her decision, will she manage to hang on to her column--and her sanity?<br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  &quot;Fat Chance&quot; has some very clever lines in it.  Great humor writing always gets a point from me.<br />  There were some terrific factoids in this book, some reassuring some not so reassuring.<br />  Maggie's emotional journey throughout the book really struck a chord with me, as I expect it will with dieters the world over.<br />  Size-wise Maggie starts out fairly abundant but whittles herself down to a plush average. Her assistant Tamara is a confirmed yo-yo dieter. And the Metro editor, Tex, is a delicious BHM (big handsome man).<br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  I just can't make up my mind if I like the writing style and the structure of this book or not.

For her singing is a dream come true, one she once thought was forever out of reach as long as she stayed the dutiful housewife and mother.  But Sabrina made some difficult decisions about her life and made that dream come true.<br />  Sexy, suave Guy Latimer, owner of the King Midas Inc. music production company, is not used to taking no for an answer.  So he's beyond shocked when he approaches Sabrina after one of her sets at Spats, only to have her turn down his offer of a recording contract.  Determined to get to the bottom of her reluctance at working with him and anxious to get to know her on a personal level, Guy manages to at least get the delicious diva to go out to dinner with him.<br />  But can he win Sabrina's trust and ongoing friendship?  And can he protect her from the old dangers which haunt her past?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  I always love to read romances that feature truly abundant heroines; they are so hard to come by!<br />  It was easy to root for the hero and heroine in this story, and there were a terrifically despicable pair of villains to loathe.<br />  Size-wise Sabrina sounded like she was built along the lines of Camryn Manheim: tall, elegant, and bountiful.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I am surprised that Sabrina, protective mother that she was, took chances with her son's safety in the way that she did.<br />Overall:<br />  Ms. Bagshaw's writing just gets better and better!  \\"Lady Blue\\" is her richest, most well-rounded tale yet.

Heroine: plump/voluptuous<br /><br />Cordelia Brown is certain she is having the worst Christmas ever.  Her loving parents have passed away and her beautiful but unkind sisters can't forgive her for inheriting the family home. So she escapes to Rome as per her father's final wishes in the hopes that she'll find some happiness there.  Perhaps while in Italy, away from the glares of her sisters, her plumpness will magically transform into voluptuousness and she'll be able to hold her head up high and even appear graceful now and then.<br />  But Cordelia's lack of self-confidence and grief over the loss of her parents follow her to Rome, as do hurtful emails from her sisters.  The distraught young woman wanders around the city and happens across a tiny, ancient church that looks like the perfect place to lick her wounds.  While weeping in one of the pews she meets a kind but mysterious stranger, an attractive man who hides half his face from her, but she catches a glimpse of it and sees that it is horribly disfigured.<br />  Suddenly Cordelia finds she is not as alone in the world as she thought, or as unattractive as her sisters insisted.  But her new friend's scars are more than skin deep and threaten to keep Cordelia from ever growing closer to him.<br />  Can Cordelia win the trust and love of this lonely kindred spirit and turn her worst Christmas into one she'll cherish forever?<br />What worked for me:<br />  The author described Rome so beautifully that I find I want to go there and see it for myself now.<br />  Aside from a spot or two which could have been polished to an even higher sheen, this story just sang for me!  Such wonderful attention paid to minutiae, and what beautiful dialogue was shared between the struggling lovers.<br />  The jump from the narrative about Cordelia and Frank to letters written by their relatives was a bit of a shock, but the e-mail exchanges certainly were a unique way to paint the family portraits.<br />  Size-wise Cordelia thought she was large and ungainly but Frank didn't agree in the least.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Those sisters!  Thank heavens I was blessed with a brother instead.  (I could go for having a niece like Pam, though.)<br /><br />Overall:<br />  \\"Leaving Winter\\" is a delightful, darling story.

But she never for one moment believed there was a grain of truth to them until she visited the Czech Republic and met a Dark One up close and personal.<br />  Trouble is, she's only met him psychically, when he drew her awareness within himself and let her feel him feeding.  She has no idea what he actually looks like, which is unfortunate since he could be one of the many men who are fighting with each other to win her affections--and the prime suspect in a murder case.<br />What worked for me:<br />  If one thing stood out overall in this story, it was the humor; there were some great lines of dialogue in it. (I would say the next most noticeable attribute was the heat of the sex scenes.)<br />  The mystery piece was fun.  I thought I had nailed down who the killer was, but the ending surprised me a bit.<br />  There were not one but two delectable hunks to drool over.<br />  Size-wise Joy was six feet tall and very sturdy.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I had some trouble suspending my disbelief, not so much over the vampirism, but over some of the heroine's actions.  I'm the kind of reader who puts herself in the main character's shoes, and I just could not see myself doing some of the things Joy did.<br /><br />  The first person point of view made it harder to get to know the other characters in the book. I also felt like Joy's best friend Roxy could have had more \\"screen time\\".<br /><br />Overall:<br />  \\"A Girl's Guide to Vampires\\" is a lighthearted romp for folks who enjoy humor in their paranormals, but for those who prefer their vampire books on the serious and scary side, it might not click.<br />Warning: It goes without saying that there are some elements of the occult in this story, but it also has some spicy moments sexually.ally.	2004-01-21

Heroine: voluptuous and sturdy<br />  Copper-haired barmaid Aenna harbored hopes that a kind merchant might fix his eye on her, marry her, and whisk her away from the Traveler's Torch to a new life, just so long as the life was an exciting one and she wasn't only to be barely remembered as so-and-so's wife at the end of her days.  But she never dreamed what fate had in store for her instead.<br />  Eavesdropping on new and interesting customers was one way to pass the time more pleasantly while working, but Aenna was chilled to the bone one evening when she overheard a group of ruffians planning for crown Prince Kurit's demise and toasting to his last night among mortals.<br />  In a panic and unsure with whom to trust the vile news, Aenna fled into the night, running as quickly as she could for the outpost the Prince was rumored to be visiting. Bursting through the doors, she delivered the message to the handsome young heir to the throne and pleaded with him to save himself.<br />  Unwilling to leave her behind to face the wrath of the assassins, the Prince and his bodyguard whisked her away with them, splitting the tiny group up farther down the road so as to confuse the would-be killers.  Aenna made the arduous trek through the woods to slip unseen into the capital city with the Prince's own cousin and bodyguard, Jarik.  By the time they reach the city gates Aenna has fallen deeply in love with this handsome, smiling man.<br />  But can there be a happily-ever-after for a peasant girl in love with a high ranking member of the court?<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  Aenna is a heroine who is easy to cheer on.  The story is told from her point of view, so the reader gets to know her intimately.<br />  There is some very good dialogue in this book, and it helps you to slip into the culture of this world.<br />  The dynamic between Jarik, Kurit, and Aenna was very interesting.<br />  Even though there tragic elements to the story, I felt overall that it held a lot of positive messages within its pages.<br />  Size-wise Aenna was not fashionably willowy like the ladies of the court, and had the good sense not to warp her figure with an uncomfortable corset.  She did lose weight at one point, by not by her choice.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  The writing could have used some minor polishing here and there.<br />  I'm hard-pressed to imagine a worse mother-in-law!<br /><br />Overall:<br />  Aptly titled, \\"Sorrows of Adoration\\" is an engaging tale sure to please many a reader.<br />Warning: There are some steamy scenes in this book.

This little book has come in handy for me as a writer, reviewer, and manuscript evaluator.  I refer to its checklists often, and I wish more first-time authors would do the same. I'd be wading through far fewer adverbs, point of view slips, unnecessary speaker attributions, and expository passages if they did.<br />However, as helpful as it is, I think that it should be used in conjunction with other reference manuals.  A &quot;planning your novel&quot; guide and a book about copy editing would round out the most basic writing library. (Authors who prefer to write in a specific genre should be sure their &quot;how-to&quot; handbook is tailored to it.)<br />Also, there's no substitute for live feedback.  \\"Self-Editing for Fiction Writers\\" is wonderful for training people to catch mistakes in their stories, but it's still easy to miss a few problem areas every now and then.<br />Even so, I'd far rather work with a beginning author who has read this handy little compendium than one who has not yet discovered it, since having common knowledge of it puts us \\"on the same page\\" when it comes to discussing their writing.	2004-01-21

For example, it's easy for most folks to assume that a fat kid is lazy or that he is a bully, that a small kid is timid and smart.  Stanley Yelnats is fat, but he's no dummy and he's no bully.  He is, however, the victim of a very small bullying child nearly every day he attends school.  And one day, as he is walking beneath an overpass, a pair of sneakers literally fall upon his head and cause him to be a victim of the judicial system as well.  Since his father always needs another set of stinky shoes for his foot deodorizer experiments, Stanley is excited to have a prime pair to give to him. Racing off with the shoes, the police see him running and assume he is up to no good.  Sure enough, the sneakers he is carrying have been reported as stolen.  They are famous footwear belonging to one Clyde \\"Sweet Feet\\" Livingston, pro baseball player and Stanley's hero.<br /><br />  Truly, it's not Stanley's fault that he is sentenced to attend a juvenile delinquents hard labor camp.  According to his family it's all because of his no good, dirty, rotten, pig stealing great great grandfather whose family, had he done what a gypsy woman once directed him to do, never would have been so cursed.<br />  While at camp Stanley has to get along with some truly rough bullies, and he has to dig a 5 x 5 hole every day in the baking hot sun while avoiding poisonous lizards, snakes, spiders, and the cruel camp staff.  But for all the faculty talk that digging holes builds character, there's a distinct undercurrent that something else is going on.  The warden is looking for something out there in the desert, something clearly important.<br />  And maybe, just maybe, if Stanley is the one to find it, it will be his ticket out of there.<br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  This well-balanced story deftly interweaves threads from the Yelnats family's past and present to keep the reader entranced and guessing.  And if that isn't enough, the characters are very sympathetic; the reader would stick with the book just to find out how things turned out for them. (And to find out how the bad guys got theirs in the end.) For me as a writer, \\"Holes\\" comes under the \\"I wish I had written that!\\" heading.<br />  Size-wise Stanley was heavy and out of shape at the beginning of the story, but hard labor and minimal food trimmed him down and toughened him up a bit.<br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />            The only problem I had with reading this story was that I didn't actually read it myself.  I listened in as my husband read a few pages of it to our boys each night at bedtime.  This meant I had to wait weeks to find out what happened because he wouldn't let me read ahead!<br />Overall:<br />             Highly recommended to readers of all ages!<br />If you liked \\"Holes\\" you might also enjoy \\"Saviors of the Bugle\\".<br />Note: this book has been made into a movie.  The main character is no longer fat, and indeed we do not know about Stanley's being picked on at school either.  But despite trimming out a great deal of the novel and adding in a few new pieces, it still is a great story and transferred very well to visual format.

Invariably they would accidentally swap mail and phone messages, but men . . . and murders?<br />  When Bill Harris, with his extremely \\"nice\\" voice, calls Nancy Stern the disillusioned preschool teacher for a blind date she knows with that certain sinking feeling that this call is really meant for the glamorous freelance journalist in the penthouse, just like all the others.  All right, so she didn't want to keep the other Nancy's mile long credit card bills, and she absolutely couldn't keep the fabulous fur coat that had been mistakenly delivered to her apartment.  But jet set Nancy had so many men wooing her, would she really miss just one tall, handsome, sexy jeweler??<br />  Unfortunately preschool Nancy gets more than she bargains for in this particular swap.  When the other Nancy turns up dead preschool Nancy thanks her lucky stars just this once for being the \\"wrong Nancy\\".  But when her purse is snatched, her apartment is ransacked, and her new boyfriend's mysterious past begins to reveal itself, she begins to wonder if she was so lucky after all.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  I love Heller's writing style.  She's got a great knack for coming up with pithy phrases, such as labeling preschool Nancy as \\"The Brunette Who Keeps Her Head\\".<br /><br />  This novel particularly resonated with me because I've worked with children on and off for years, so the preschool scenes were a bit of a flashback for me.<br />  Size-wise Nancy was a comfortable sounding average, who was fine with her figure until she met the other Nancy Stern, with her impossibly long legs and huge...[chest].<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  I was sick to my stomach the entire time plain Nancy was trying to pass herself off as \\"fancy Nancy\\".  I would hate trying to do something like that myself. (Odd, but I don't recall feeling that way when I read Goldsmith's \\"Switcheroo\\", and in that case the identity swap took place over a much longer period in the novel. Go figure!)<br />  I kinda felt bad for glitzy Nancy, snarky woman that she was.  Her life obviously didn't make her happy, her death was untimely, and she faded away from the novel once her purpose had been served, as did her mysterious daughter.

But just when Ruthie feels motivated to move things along with her own fellow, he makes a run for it and leaves Ruthie to console herself with chocolate cake and champagne left over from the latest connubial bash at her family's business.<br />  Carefree bachelor and corporate hotel scout Robert Kendall is always on the prowl for a new addition to the Winchester chain of hotels.  He knows how to best gauge the quality of a potential acquisition, and that's to peek in the kitchens when no one else is around.  But to his surprise, his midnight excursion to the depths of the Kerrigan causes him to stumble upon a cute, if a bit teary and bleary eyed, red head elbow deep in chocolate cake.  Southern gentleman that he is, he can't help but inquire if she is all right.<br />  One thing leads to another and this completely disparate pair find themselves falling for each other.  But what do you do when you are only compatible in bed, and find yourselves on opposite sides of a potentially ugly business merger to boot?<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  I liked Ruthie's taste in men (at least once she dumped the boyfriend) and ice cream.  (New York Super Fudge Chunk is divine!)<br />  The characters were sweet, and the story was at times sexy and funny.<br />  Size-wise Ruthie was soft and round.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  You may have to check reality at the door of this particular hotel in order to believe how Ruthie unknowingly wound up in sexual heaven in Robert's bed.<br />  Ruthie fought maybe a bit too long against getting together with Robert for my tastes.  But she did have a point, which is that getting together with someone with whom you have nothing in common seems, well, pointless.<br />  I would have liked to have seen Monica get taken down a peg or three.

And the secondary romance was very sweet.<br />  Size-wise Charlie was rugged, but with soft edges.  She thought she was fat, but Garrett didn't.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I really felt there was a lot of potential in this book, but it could have used more polishing and some rigorous editing before going to press.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  \\"Along Comes a Legend\\" might appeal best to fans of Western Historicals and caterpillar-to-butterfly stories.<br />Warning there is coarse language and some sexy scenes in this book.<br />If you liked \\"Along Comes a Legend\\" you might also enjoy \\"Beckett's Birthright\\", \\"The Bride of Willow Creek\\", \\"No Ordinary Princess\\", \\"Land of Dreams\\", \\"Wishes\\", \\"A Country Christmas\\", \\"The Bluebird and the Sparrow\\",  or \\"The Hero's Best Friend\\".	2003-12-13

But then she adopts a pathetic little stray mutt and her entire world is turned upside down.  A simple \\"take it to the pound\\" from her all-American coach boyfriend plunges her into the realization that he's not the man for her.  Whoever \\"her\\" is.  She's not really sure who she is anymore. In fact the only thing she is sure of is that she wants that dog.  And her sister's sexy ex-husband.  And a rundown old house all her own.  But that's it.  Really.<br />  Before she knows it, Quinn's decision to assert herself has rippled through the small town and broken up several other relationships, created some new ones, and driven the school's championship winning baseball team toward the bottom of the league.<br />  Can she and her town survive her epiphany--and her ex's increasing mental instability?<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  I thought Quinn was a terrific heroine, a nice gal who got caught up in a weird situation.<br />  True romantics will be glad to hear that there are lots of couples to root for in this story, their issues being the sort that can be related to by most women. (I know I certainly understood them.)<br />  Some of the imagery in the story was just so vivid I felt like I was really there. And the humor is deliciously, wickedly, laugh out loud funny.<br />  Size-wise Quinn was a softly-rounded average.  She thought she might have about ten pounds to lose, but the men around her thought her lush curves wore those ten \\"extra\\" pounds very well.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  There were a lot of characters to keep track of in this book and the reader spends a fair amount of time in the shoes of each one.  This makes for deeper characters but the constant juggling of people might be confusing to some readers.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  \\"Crazy For You\\" has a great blend of sexual tension, suspense, and humor.

Her sense of independence makes her dig her heels in against the union, but she soon finds herself relenting when she discovers that life with Gavin would not be as unpleasant as she'd thought.  And when her uncle's death seems less like an accident than previously thought the security of marrying Gavin is too much for Diana to pass up, so she accepts his proposal and settles in for a lifelong marriage of convenience.<br />  But Gavin has other ideas about what their marriage ought to be like and sets out to make his wife love him.  But first he must capture the fiend who caused her uncle's demise--a killer who will surely strike again.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  Gavin was an intriguing hero who appears to be very laid back and jaded yet far more with it than he lets on.<br />  The mystery intertwined with the love story was a good one, and even though I thought I had a handle on what was happening with it, the solution ultimately surprised me.<br />  Size-wise Diana was tall and thought she was too large, but Gavin thought she was lush and luscious.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Diana didn't come off as strong as I felt she was touted as being.  In fact she was a bit missish in spots, though there was a satisfactory explanation for that given later on in the story.<br /><br />Overall:<br />  &quot;Miss Carlyle's Curricle&quot; is a pleasant diversion for a rainy afternoon.<br />Warning: There's a steamy scene in this book.<br />If you liked &quot;Miss Carlyle's Curricle&quot; you might also enjoy  &quot;Slightly Wicked&quot;, &quot;Into Temptation&quot;, &quot;Suddenly You&quot;, &quot;The Accidental Bride&quot;, &quot;The Bride and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Fire-Flower&quot;, &quot;The Last Days of a Rake&quot;, &quot;Cat and the Countess&quot;, &quot;The Courtship&quot;, or &quot;Enchanting Pleasures&quot;.e and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Fire-Flower&quot;, &quot;The Last Days of a Rake&quot;, &quot;Cat and the Countess&quot;, &quot;The Courtship&quot;, or &quot;Enchanting Pleasures&quot;.	2003-12-03

After all, sex is what women who look like centerfolds do best, right?<br />  But don't try telling that to Kayla Luck, owner of \\"Charmed\\" finishing school for men. You'll just break her innocent little heart.  Especially if you happen to be sexy, happy to be single Kane McDermott, the undercover police detective who is investigating her and has already won that same sweet heart.<br />  Too bad for both him and his case the feeling is mutual.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  It was funny watching a slick alpha male trying to pass himself off as being inept with women.  I kinda wish that had gone on longer.<br />  The overall setup for this story was intriguing, as was the mystery.<br />          Size-wise Kayla was a lushly built gal whose brains were never taken seriously because of the size of her bosom. (As a side note I have always thought that it is interesting that women with large breasts are treated as sex objects, but women with both large breasts and hips are viewed as being maternal.)<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I felt this book could have used a bit more polishing, but that's just my perfectionism I guess.  And for some reason the chemistry between the hero and heroine just didn't sizzle for me, which is odd because I generally I love a tough guy as the lead. (I enjoy reading about (near) virginal heroines and alpha heroes in Regencies, but that combo doesn't sit as well with me in contemporaries. Who knows why?)<br /><br />Overall:<br />  \\"Simply Sinful\\" might appeal to fans of sexy contemporary romances, especially if they like a bit of intrigue thrown into the mix.<br />Warning: This book has some steamy moments and coarse words within its pages.<br />If you liked \\"Simply Sinful\\" you might also enjoy \\"Getting Lucky\\", \\"It Had to be You\\", \\"Lola Carlyle Reveals All\\", \\"Born to be Wild\\", \\"Some Girls Do\\", \\"Heaven in Your Eyes\\",  \\"Runaway Bay\\", or \\"This Heart of Mine\\".ight also enjoy \\"Getting Lucky\\", \\"It Had to be You\\", \\"Lola Carlyle Reveals All\\", \\"Born to be Wild\\", \\"Some Girls Do\\", \\"Heaven in Your Eyes\\",  \\"Runaway Bay\\", or \\"This Heart of Mine\\".	2003-12-02

Not from keeping an eye on her siblings, or from monitoring the health of the residents of her tiny hometown Bourner's Crossing.  So when her ankle has a break of its own during a torrential downpour in the middle of the woods, she has no choice but to slow down.  Lucky for her a handsome stranger materializes from the mists to aid her.<br />  Seeking refuge from the storm in her gallant rescuer's cabin, Kate is shocked to see him slanting an appraising glance her way every now and then.  It's been quite some time since a man has looked at her that way, and having one do so now gives her butterflies in her stomach despite the pain in her leg. But she's far more shocked when he strips off his sopping wet shirt and reveals a gruesome, scar-covered torso.<br />  Attraction mingled with a need to nurture prompts Kate to make friendly overtures toward the standoffish man as he drives her home to safety, and a tenuous relationship is formed between the two.  But as the days pass Kate notices during their brief courtship that something doesn't add up about Sam, a recluse who wants to reach out to people and help them despite his desire for extreme privacy.  And most intriguingly, odd things seem to be happening in town lately since Sam's arrival.  Things that by the laws of nature should never happen.<br />  Is Kate suffering from paranoia or is there some connection between her new swain and the mysterious goings on?<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  I always like a tough guy who's a sucker for kids, and Sam is certainly that.  And his having been a Navy jet jockey doesn't hurt either.  I also really liked Katie, who was down to earth, sweet, loving, and capable.  Also, I loved seeing her work at her job as a nurse midwife. (What can I say, I'm nuts about babies.)<br />  I'm not a fan of books where the hero and heroine jump into bed within minutes of meeting each other, so \\"Miracles\\" scored points with me on that count by letting Sam and Katie get to know each other first.<br />  Size-wise Katie was curvy but figured most guys saw her as the big sister type. Sam, however, thought she was soft and sexy and delicious and made sure she knew it!<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I loved the ending, but I could have used a one-year-later prologue just to see how things were going for everyone.<br /><br />Overall:<br />  \\"Miracles\\" is well-written, charming and sexy all at once.  Fans of paranormal and contemporary romances should really enjoy this one, but if you don't go for supernatural experiences, this book may not be to your tastes.<br />Warning: Though \\"Miracles\\" is considered inspirational it isn't a Christian romance.

And now it would seem her sanity has fled as well.  Surely it has or she wouldn't be dreaming of lying in her loved ones' embrace deep in the silent grave, wouldn't hear the siren call of a tormented ghost and his unearthly violin's haunting music.<br />  Can Triana resist the seductive lure of the virtuoso or will she follow him into darkness?<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  I could relate to the heroine as far as her size and her fierce desire for a musical ability she has always lacked.  I also understood her self-flagellation, though not the extreme depth of it.  The author's use of first person point of view really drove those feelings and insights home.<br />  The spectral prince and his narrative were intriguing. (Honestly, I didn't get into &quot;Violin&quot; until he revealed his history to us halfway through the book, though I didn't fall for him like our heroine did.  He just wasn't mesmerizing for me.)<br /><br />  Size-wise Triana was short and pear-shaped. One of her sisters was also quite round.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br />  This novel felt a bit like &quot;Amadeus&quot; meets &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; meets &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, as channeled by Gertrude Stein through Anne Rice.  The writing was pretty convoluted at times in order to capture the essence of madness, but if you aren't in the mood for that sort of thing trying to slog through it will likely drive you mad yourself.  (My own head wasn't in the right place for this book when I read it.  I wanted it to recreate that delicious chilling thrill I'd had while reading &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; during a house-sitting stint on a dark and stormy night.  An unfair standard, I know. But frankly, the old Zebra gothics did more for my goose bumps than this particular Rice venture did.)<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  &quot;Violin&quot; is a dark and intriguing look at family dysfunction, but don't pick it up expecting to have your hair and toes curled by page three. Or at all.<br />Warning there is an extreme fixation with death and a few disturbing images in this book.<br />If you liked &quot;Violin&quot; you might also enjoy &quot;Etta Mae's Little Theory&quot; and the Halloween reading list.<BR> <BR>Overall:<BR> <BR>             &quot;Violin&quot; is a dark and intriguing look at family dysfunction, but don't pick it up expecting to have your hair and toes curled by page three.

But every time these opposing desires start bickering in her head, the food demons win out and she finds herself agonizing as each bite she consumes carries her farther away from her size six ideal.  Anxious to love something other than food Ruby fixes her eye on her gorgeous coworker, but her low self esteem keeps her from trying to reach out to him.  Or to any man she wants.  Up until this point the peaks of her romantic experiences have been flatter than Kansas, and the only men in her life now are her lackluster ex-hubby and her gay pal.<br />  Bootylicious Wanda is anxious to make it big in the plus modeling world, but she has three strikes against her: size, age, and race.  Add to that a snotty, rich, daddy's girl coworker who undermines her at every turn, Wanda will be lucky not to wind up in the slammer for wringing the chick's neck.<br />  Luscious Simone is dying to get out of the local TV news racket and into the limelight of the entertainment industry.  Literally.  She even figures the notoriety of leaving behind a trail of boy toys might add to her cachet.  But she's got tunnel vision where her career is concerned and doesn't see that her life is unraveling around the edges.  Living fast and furious might be her ticket to the top--or to six feet underground.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  This book has a great cover!  It's sexy and sassy, colorful and eye-catching.  And most importantly it doesn't downsize the big girls.<br />  The story is funny, has interesting characters, good plot twists, and a great if not completely pat (the way I like it) ending.

These particular characters sucked me into their lives so that I just kept on turning the pages to find out what would happen to them.<br />  This novel was also filled with little bits of wisdom, one thought which struck me singularly hard I plan to store up for use with my own children one day: \\"I didn't raise you to fit in.

And to top it all off, she has to travel with the security firm owner cum temporary bodyguard, Michael Wingate, a man she is trying desperately hard not to be attracted to.  A man who is running just as hard from his history as she is from hers.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  I liked the characters and the storyline.  But I particularly liked the fact that Wilhelmina's story was given so much attention.  (I just wish I'd gotten to know her lover Doug better.)<br />  I suspect Ms. Banks is a fan of Jennifer Crusie, but instead of her romantic comedy featuring a weird looking dog, this time we get an ugly cat.<br />  Size-wise Katie was slender, but trying to hide her prettiness under plain clothes and a severe hairdo.

If she doesn't marry and produce an heir, her inheritance will slip through her fingers and pass to another relative.  So she fixes her eyes upon Thomas, a tough, young, debt-ridden fighter who is a champion in the ring but untried in real combat--a circumstance that is set to change when he is kidnapped just before his wedding.<br />  Thomas has a passel of sisters, the most annoying of which is the plump red-headed midwife Emma, who gave up her dreams of being married when her oafish betrothed abandoned her as soon as her dowry dissipated into thin air.  Now she alternately ignores and exacerbates all men folk, especially the handsome, dangerous-looking Martin, right-hand man to her new sister-in-law.<br />  But some persistent person means to see Evelyn's estate pass out of her hands.  If kidnapping the bridegroom won't do the trick, then perhaps kidnapping the very pregnant bride will.  Can Thomas, Emma, and Martin rescue Evelyn and her unborn babe in time?<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  I thought that the opening for this story was pretty strong, dropping the reader right into the kidnapping of Thomas rather than filling us all in on the whole history first. The rest of the storyline was also enjoyable and the characters were sympathetic, with the women being particularly strong.<br />  Size-wise Evelyn and Emma were opposite as day and night--one a slender fighter, the other a plump nurturer.  But when cornered Emma could handle herself very well, thank you very much!<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br />  The writing was less than polished in spots, with some rather noticeable typos and missing words in some passages.<br />  I didn't mind it once I realized what sort of story this was, but its inclusion in the fantasy genre had me conjuring up magical beasties and such which never appeared.  This book really feels more like a medieval romance with some unusual societal details in place of those of Europe from a thousand years ago.<br /><br />Overall:<br />  Fans of medieval romances should enjoy this story, but fantasy fans looking for paranormal elements may be disappointed when they don't appear.<br />Warning: There are some steamy and violent scenes in this book.<br />If you liked &quot;Lady of the Knife&quot; you might also enjoy the &quot;Darkover&quot; series  &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, &quot;Earth Song&quot;, or &quot;Oracle&quot;.appeared.

I love watching their fascination at what a struggle it was to survive in the rugged American wilderness, and can't help but smile as they absorb their first history lesson in such a painless fashion.<br />  Size-wise Laura Ingalls was described as being round like a French pony, but she really longed to be willowy with golden curls like her older sister Mary.  From the very first book we hear how five year old Laura was so disappointed with her appearance and see how she always measured herself against her sister's paler beauty.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br />  The only disappointment I have had with this series is that the final book is so short and lacks the warmth of the earlier novels, probably because Mrs. Wilder passed away before it was rewritten.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  Fans of historical and juvenile literature should enjoy these books. (And fans of romance should enjoy the later books when Laura meets her husband.)<br />Note: The series was the basis of the popular television show, \\"Little House on the Prairie\\".<br />Warning:  The story is sweet and easygoing, but also deals with the harsh realities of life in that era.

But then the subject of their first major article goes missing and what began as simple volunteer work takes a turn for the mysterious--and the dangerous!<br />What worked for me:<br />  Wendy was a pretty savvy young lady and had tremendous dedication and perseverance where her cause was concerned.<br />  I thought the main plot of \\"Saviors of the Bugle\\" was interesting, but was especially impressed by how deftly the author intertwined intense subplots involving difficult subjects such as child and animal abuse, grieving family members, and government corruption without making the book too heavy.<br />  Size-wise Wendy started out chubby, or at least thinking she was chubby but by the end of the book she realized she wasn't big at all. (Plus it didn't hurt when her mother stopped overfeeding her.)<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  Having characters named Wendy and Wanda within a breath of each other had me confused at times. (That'll teach me not to speed read!)<br />Overall:<br />  This really cute read for Middle Graders and Jr. High Schoolers provides an interesting way to get a look into the inner workings of journalism.  It also presents an opening for discussions on civics, ethics, and other tough topics with teachers and parents.	2003-09-12

Heroines: varied<br />  When aging Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert sent away to an orphanage for a youngster to give them a hand around their farm, they were expecting a sturdy lad to arrive at the local train station.  But instead what they got was a slip of a girl with bright orange hair, an inquisitive mind, and a nonstop mouth.  Preparing to send her back, Anne begs the brother-sister pair to consider keeping her, stating that she can do all the work a boy could. Softened by her heartfelt pleas the Cuthberts give Ann-with-an-E Shirley a trial period at Green Gables, and though it is a close thing, they decide to keep her.<br />  Poor Anne has the worst time settling into her new home.  Her runaway mouth offends the neighbors and her impulsiveness is forever landing her in trouble, whether she is turning her orange hair green, breaking her slate over the head of handsome class tease Gilbert Blythe, or nearly drowning herself in a leaky rowboat while reenacting \\"The Lady of Shalott\\".<br />  Fortunately Anne's loving nature wins her more friends than her mouth earns her enemies.  The little orphan girl is soon adored by her foster parents and most of her peers, particularly her shy neighbor Diana Berry, who becomes Anne's \\"bosom friend\\".<br /><br />What worked for me:<br />  Anne is my bosom friend too!  She's always felt like a real person to me because she's so spunky yet sweet.  And I can certainly relate to her impulsiveness, though my hair turned hot pink rather than bright green. I do admire her ability to stick to something, but not her grudge holding.  Poor Gilbert spent years trying earn his way back into Anne's good books!  (The romantic in me just adores the on-again-off-again relationship between Anne and Gil.)<br />  Size-wise Anne was a skinny little girl with carroty hair who wished she was plump with nut brown tresses or had sleek raven locks like her best friend Diana.  Ironically, she grows up to be fashionably slender and it is then comfortably-built Diana who pines to be more like Anne.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br />  There are a couple of instances in the series where people considered to be larger than pleasingly plump are not cast in the most flattering light.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />  Fans of historical and juvenile literature should enjoy these books.

Heroine:  average/plump<br />  The night was hot, but she was not.  Yet something about the short, mousy girl in line at the ice cream stand caught the attention of sexy millionaire playboy Daniel Barone anyway, and he wasn't sorry when he spotted her a second time on that sultry August evening in the crowd milling around Boston's Faneuil Hall<br />  Shy, quiet Phoebe Richards couldn't believe that she, a librarian who lived a simple life filled with romance novels and daydreams about daring, dashing heroes had actually met one of Boston's most eligible, adventurous bachelors, not to mention one of the only truly chivalrous men left in the world.  Too bad he only wanted to be friends after rescuing Phoebe from a perilous situation.<br />  Or did he?<br />What worked for me:<br />  I adore puns, so I loved the rather apt title.<br />  The characters were wonderful: shy little Phoebe was very sweet, sexy Daniel just charmed the heck out of me, and I would have gladly given Pheebs' surrogate mother Leslie a high-five for taking our heroine to task over her tendency to put herself down.<br />  There was a nice mix of drama and humor in the story. The instance when Daniel and Phoebe cross paths for the second time was absolutely priceless!<br />  Size-wise, Phoebe was short and roundish.  No mile-long legs and impossibly perky bosoms on this gal!<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Jumping into the middle of a family series like \\"The Barones\\" is like plunging into a soap opera five years after it debuts. There was a huge amount of information on Daniel's background handed out in large lumps.  Fortunately this only happened in a couple of passages.  The rest of the time was focused on the budding relationship of  Pheebs and Daniel, which was of more interest to me.<br />Overall:<br />  A fun, sexy read!

But deep down she is afraid.  Afraid of flying.  Afraid of commitment.  Afraid of having her heart broken.  But one thing she is not afraid of is Prince Ch&eacute;  Vedla.  He's simply the arrogant, annoying, uninvited houseguest (and soon-to-be-brother-in-law) who turned up on her doorstep unannounced in the dead of night.  Clearly, it's not her fault she doused a Prince of the galaxy with pepper spray!<br />  But sparks are soon flying between the two and before long it looks like things will be getting spicier than the contents of the canister Ilana erroneously emptied on Ch&eacute;.<br />  If only he wasn't bound by eleven thousand years of tradition to marry a Vash Nadah woman who is his equal!<br />  What worked for me:<br />  Ilana and the ultra-Alpha male Ch&eacute; were great characters and the culture clash that resulted from their interactions was very amusing at times.<br />  I loved the fact that the Conan-type bodyguard in the story (named Muffin of all things!) really dug thick chicks.<br />  And hopefully Ms. Grant's vision of the future comes true in at least one respect: all the cars on the CA freeways in her story are electric.<br />  Size-wise Ilana was barely described and would have been considered an \\"everywoman\\" character but for the briefest of references to her strong, shapely figure.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Dropping into the middle of this series wasn't a problem for me as I felt I got a fairly good background on what was happening in this universe.

Yet despite the gravity of these subjects, there was a lot of dark humor in this book, particularly in the journal entries which opened each chapter.  In many cases, they were the brightest gems in this story.<br />  Size-wise we saw Serpentine at different times in her life, and each time she was a different size: average, voluptuous, abundant; but no matter what number graced the tags in her clothes, she was struggling to love herself.<br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  The jumping around in time could be a bit confusing, but the little vignettes of Serpentine's life over the years were fascinating and really helped to make her painfully real.<br />  The novel felt a bit preachy in a few spots, but for the most part the messages were discreetly filtered into the book.<br /><br />Overall:<br />  \\"All of Me\\" has a touching, powerful message wrapped up in an attractive package and is well worth searching out.<br />Warning: there are some coarse words and sexual scenarios in this book.<br />If you liked \\"All of Me\\" you might also enjoy \\"The High Price of a Good Man\\", \\"Good in Bed\\", \\"Jemima J.\\", \\"Commitments\\", or \\"Etta Mae's Little Theory\\".Me\\" you might also enjoy \\"The High Price of a Good Man\\", \\"Good in Bed\\", \\"Jemima J.\\", \\"Commitments\\", or \\"Etta Mae's Little Theory\\".	2003-07-24

Heroine Stephanie Plum is from the Burg, a close-knit neighborhood in Trenton, New Jersey where the gals wear their skirts tighter and shorter than their spandex biker shorts, their make-up is louder than their booming car stereos, and their ultra-tall back-teased hair barely fits under the doorways at the mall.<br />  Formerly a discount lingerie buyer, Italian-Hungarian Stephanie falls on hard times and, in a fit of desperation, approaches her sleazy cousin Vinnie about a job as a bond recovery agent at his bail bonding business.  Murder, mayhem, and mishaps abound as Stephanie tries to get her \\"collars\\" and discovers the job is far more difficult when you're the only unarmed person in Jersey. (Stephanie actually owns a piece but prefers to leave it in the cookie jar in her kitchen.)<br />  What worked for me:<br />  As much as I enjoy the zany plots and wacky secondary characters, I think what keeps me coming back to the series the most is Steph's tangled love life.  (It must be nice to have not one but two delicious hunks chasing after you!)  Janet Evanovich honed her word craft skills while writing romantic fiction, so she certainly knows how to spin out the sexual tension between the superbly-drawn characters of Stephanie, Morelli, and Ranger.  In fact, it takes several books of the series before there is any culmination of lust and love whatsoever.  Talk about extended foreplay!<br />  Some folks might not find the mysteries convoluted enough, but not being a Perry Mason myself I like the fact that I catch on to the clues before Steph.  Makes me feel quite the sharp cookie. :^)<br />  As far as size goes, Stephanie lays a few numbers on you weight-wise, but you get a sense that she's fudging them a bit.  There are some characters who have a decidedly fat-phobic view on life but fortunately Lula is there to straighten them out. (Note she goes on a diet in book nine, but it all works out ok in the end.)<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  Serial writing is a great gimmick.  It's all about leaving the reader hanging by a thread waiting desperately for the next installation in the series.  I was lucky, having jumped on the band wagon late I was able to zip through all of the books back-to-back. Now that I am all caught up, though, I  too shall have to endure the agony of waiting to find out what will happen in the next book.<br />Overall:<br />  Excellent writing, interesting plots, wildly colorful recurring characters* (see cast list below), and an infusion of humor make this series a great joy to read, with each book even better than the one before!

Joyce \\"persuades\\" Vinnie in a similar manner to hire her on as a skip tracer, much to Steph's everlasting exasperation.<br />       Big Blue:  An ancient powder blue Buick with windows like portholes.  Steph hates this car because it's old, ugly, and turns on a buck-and-a-half.

Heroine:  very tall, abundant<br />  Mississippi-born, Compton-bred, and now based in upscale Cerritos, Miss Queenisha Renae Sutton is doing very well for herself as a buyer for Macy's.  But she'd like more going on in her personal life. For starters, how about finally meeting a man worthy of being with her?<br />  Lured by her best friend, self-styled voodoo priestess Poetta, to a charity bachelor auction with promises of meeting the delicious Billy Dee Williams, Queenie winds up instead buying a date with drop-dead gorgeous Denzel-look-alike Zeke Washington.  However the auction's promised single outing with him isn't enough for Queenie; she's made up her mind that she wants this man for good.<br />  But dating the super-fine Zeke comes with a price even heftier than the $1250 check Queenie cut for the pleasure of his company. The question is: is he worth it?<br />What worked for me:<br />  I would love to have friends like Queenie and Poe.  They'd certainly make my life more interesting!  Queenie was a riot and it was fun living in her head, but at the same time it was hard not to try and be her conscience and yell at her when she was about to do something she really shouldn't.<br />  It was very easy to visualize the story's colorful, well-defined cast of characters. It wouldn't surprise me to one day see it at the cinema with luscious, lovely Latifah in the lead role.<br />  Size-wise Queenie was very tall and quite bountiful; so don't judge this book by its cover, it does not do justice to Queenie's statuesque build.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  The story is in first person point of view and I was thrown off a bit at first when Queenie would switch from her casual dialogue to a more formal-sounding narration.  But eventually I got used to it and began to relish the rich prose.<br />  Some of the unexpected twists in this story were maybe a bit too twisted and over-the-top for my personal taste, but they still earn points just for being so unpredictable.<br />Overall:<br />  \\"The High Price of a Good man\\" is sassy fun; a well-written multi-cultural novel which might also appeal to fans of Chick Lit and romance.  Be sure to grab a copy this summer to take to the beach!<br />Warning: this book features some coarse language, weight-loss, and occult and sexual scenarios.<br />If you liked \\"The High Price of a Good Man\\" you might also enjoy \\"Good in Bed\\", \\"Commitments\\", \\"Living Large\\", or \\"Jemima J.\\".earn points just for being so unpredictable.<br />Overall:<br />     \\"The High Price of a Good man\\" is sassy fun; a well-written multi-cultural novel which might also appeal to fans of Chick Lit and romance.

Heroine: voluptuous/everywoman<br /><br />  Stunning Lucia Sartori is renowned for her beauty throughout New York's Greenwich Village.  But it will take more than an admiring man from the neighborhood to turn her head, because she has plans.  She's going somewhere with her life, and it won't be to the kitchen of some Italian matriarch who will turn her into a slave.<br />  No, high-flying Lucia is destined for so much more than that.  With her eye for color and design and her knack for turning up a perfect hem, she'll make dazzling clothes for the cream of society instead.  And perhaps if the right man comes along, one who will let her live out her dreams of being a career woman, then maybe he'll be welcome to tag along for the ride.<br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  Though it started out slow I loved the storyline, which rewarded me in the end for sticking with it.<br />  I got a kick out of Lucia's friends and close-knit large family.  Even though they drove each other crazy, they all came together in times of trouble and heartbreak.<br />  The little touches, such as including recipes for delicious Italian dishes, added even more flavor to the story.  (Sorry.  Couldn't resist that one!)<br />  I thought it was very interesting how the book followed the life of a young career girl in the 1950s.  That couldn't have been an easy time to be breaking out in the business world as a woman, when you were expected to go back to the kitchen now that the boys were home from the war.<br />  Size-wise Lucia wasn't really described except to say that the men all admired her figure.  Given the time period and what was in vogue then, I couldn't help but picture a young Sophia Loren type of gal.<br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  Some aspects of the writing style didn't really click with me.<br /><br />Overall:<br />  \\"Lucia, Lucia\\" is a very enjoyable tale.

All she has to do is slum in Ireland for a few months and assure the smooth transition of a beautiful Gothic castle from its current owner to her boss' eager, waiting hands.<br />  But she hadn't counted on falling in love with the quirky old estate. Nor did she expect to care about what opinion the current owner, handsome Conor O'Meara, had of her.  But care she does, and now she has to find a way to make everyone in her life happy. Yet the harder she tries to win, the more it seems like she is going to lose everything she has fought for.<br />  If she can only make it work by giving up one thing she desires, what, or who, will it be?<br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  I am so glad that the heroine didn't stay prickly through two-thirds of the novel!<br />  The sexual tension was pretty good.  (And let's face it, you can't go wrong with a hero who is an Irish version of Mel Gibson!)<br />  I love happy endings, and this one certainly fit the bill.<br />  Size-wise Kelly was average and on a diet at the beginning of the book.

The novel seemed more focused at times on her vulnerability than her capability, though she did get her act together at the last minute.<br />  I did have a problem with a major component of the storyline, but can't mention it here because I don't want to spoil the story for you.  (If you've already read it, though, pop into the forum and see what I'm talking about.)    <br /><br />Overall:<br />  If you like your romantic suspense funny or want your romantic comedies to have some tension, you should enjoy this story as well as the other two novels which will make up the \\"heaven\\" trilogy.<br />Warning: This book has some steamy moments.<br />If you liked \\"Heaven in Your Eyes\\" you might also enjoy \\"I Dream of You\\", \\"Getting Lucky\\", \\"Walking After Midnight\\", \\"Fast Women\\", \\"Lola Carlyle Reveals All\\",  \\"Born to be Wild\\", and \\"Wishes\\".	2003-07-05

An overturned coach in the middle of nowhere. A dashing, helpful stranger made all the more appealing by a young girl's fanciful mind.<br />  To Judith Law her rescue from the muddy roadside was absolutely providential, and in more ways than one.  Here was her chance to experience both her first and last night of passion before becoming a lifelong paid companion in her well-to-do aunt's employ.  And it seemed such a simple thing to love this stranger for but a few days, then leave him behind forever.<br />  So imagine Judith's utter surprise when her erstwhile lover arrives at her aunt's house and is revealed to be none other than Rannulf Bedwyn, the favored suitor for her beautiful young cousin's hand!<br />  And yet Rannulf declares privately to Judith that he'd rather have her--red hair, freckles, curves and all. Can this be true, or is Judith dreaming her way to disappointment once again?<br />What worked for me:<br />  I liked the leonine Rannulf even though I usually prefer my heroes tall, dark, and devastating.  He was a bit of a playboy at first but other than that was a reasonably stand up guy.  Not as alpha as one might like, but not a simpering wuss either.<br />  There was some pretty good tension in this story that kept me reading on.  I just had to find out how Judith's horrible family got their comeuppance in the end.<br />  Size-wise Judith was voluptuous and very attractive to men, though she wasn't aware of it.  In fact, her religious family had her convinced that she was ugly as sin.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I wanted to like our heroine and her family, who sold her off into slavery to her unkind aunt. (But then, it would have been more or less the same scenario had she been married off instead.)  And mostly I did like her, but she just made one foolish decision after another, whether it was jumping into bed with a complete stranger or later turning down his proposal of marriage after they had gotten to know each other and actually fallen in love.  Of course, had she not made those mistakes this book would have been all of 8 pages long.<br /><br />Overall:<br />  If you can set aside your common sense and think with your heart instead of your head, you'll enjoy this Regency era romp.

She makes certain that young Jilly is provided for when her parents leave her alone in the world as a young woman with no real prospects.  She gives her Thornyhold, a beautiful old Georgian House that once belonged to a witch named Goody Gostelow, which becomes a refuge for the poor young Geillis.<br />  But how truly safe is she at her new shelter?  A disturbing dream, messages from the great beyond, and neighbors who send out mixed signals as to whether or not they want her there leave Geillis wondering about the sanctity of her new home and the sanity of her mind.<br /><br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  For the most part this is a very gentle pastoral story filled with lovely descriptions of a time gone by in the countryside of England 50+ years ago when not all houses had phones, neighbors dropped in to clean your house with you, and herbal remedies were more trusted than doctor's prescriptions. But the first few chapters about Geillis as a child, which were necessary to show why she is the way she is and add depth to the story, were decidedly sad in several places.<br />  Size-wise Geillis wasn't really described, but her neighbor was a fairly large woman.<br /><br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  Because of its idyllic pace it didn't have me on the edge of my seat the way I expect a gothic romance should.  In fact the romance and even the suspense in \\"Thornyhold\\" were very mild, almost secondary even, so that I think the book seems more like a light paranormal fiction than a gothic.<br />Overall:<br /><br />  A very sweet story worth indulging in, especially if you are a fan of witches and/or gardening.<br />Warning:  There are a few references to the occult in this novel.<br />If you liked \\"Thornyhold\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Dancing Floor\\".A very sweet story worth indulging in, especially if you are a fan of witches and/or gardening.<br />Warning:   There are a few references to the occult in this novel.<br />If you liked \\"Thornyhold\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Dancing Floor\\".	2003-06-24

I got into the \\"Darkover\\" series as a teen and slurped them up quite eagerly.  (Bear in mind these novels were written from the early 1960s onward, so some of them have a heavy dose of pro-woman thinking.  But I can live with that, as there were no stories of this sort in that day and age.  DARKOVER was groundbreaking when it came to putting women at the forefront of science fiction and fantasy novels instead of relegating them to the cast of supporting characters behind a \\"more capable\\" male protagonist.)<br />  Size-wise the women come in every shape, size, and ability.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Opinion is divided as to how to sort out all these books. There are 20+ novels set in this world, but the author did not write them \\"in order\\".  You can go to her home page and see both the publication order and the chronological order of the books and decide for yourself how to read them.  If you choose to start with the chronologically earliest novel be forewarned it's good and will give you a great sense of background on the world, but it isn't the very best of the series so read a few more titles as well before making your decision about the universe of DARKOVER.

But what is to be done when two sisters each long for the same man?

This is a quality publication in every sense of the phrase.<br />  Each chapter was headed by highly apt quotes.  I found myself referring back to them at the end of each chapter to see just what the author might have been hinting at when she chose those proverbs.<br />  What texture the deftly interwoven archaic Scottish words added to the dialogue!  And though the novel was of a heavy note overall, there were several snippets of speech which were quite amusing and lightened things up a bit. (However, as a hearing impaired person I don't think I could have managed the audio book version of this story.  The Scottish dialect and words would have skittered off my ears and never even have entered my brain for examination.)<br />  I also greatly appreciated the fact that this novel didn't appear to be whitewashed.  There were healthy doses of the old superstitions that even the staunchest Christians of the day were likely to believe in.<br />  Inspirational or otherwise, I'm not a fan of novels where I can feel the author standing on a soapbox with a bullhorn inside the story. However, despite the fact that this plot was plucked straight from the Bible (though altered somewhat to fit its new setting of 18th C.

I think I went into it expecting something shocking, like a \\"Blair Witch\\" meets contemporary gothic romance sort of hybrid, and when I didn't get that kind of intense, high-speed action I found it to be a bit draggy.<br />Overall:<BR>          <BR>               \\"The Dancing Floor\\" didn't quite have the zing the back cover blurb really promised.  Still, it's definitely worth the searching out at the library if you are a fan of witches and/or gardening.<br />Warning:   There are several mentions of the occult in this novel and don't expect many mentions of floors, dancing or otherwise in this oddly-named story.<br />If you liked \\"The Dancing Floor\\" you might also enjoy \\"Thornyhold\\".	2003-06-15

But she soon discovers her \\"soft center\\" when her hormones start going haywire with a surprise pregnancy.  After all, it's not everyday you go into the doctor's for a scheduled hysterectomy and come out with a due date for a baby--by a guy you are about to dump, no less!<br />        But Max is about to find out that even the toughest cookie is liable to crumble under the right circumstances.  If the pregnancy wasn't enough to bowl her over, surely the multiple murders occurring around town will do it.  Especially since all of them are connected in one way or another to Max herself!<br />What worked for me:<br />  All right, I admit it, Max grew on me.  Rough-around-the edges and with odd taste in men she's very different from me, but I think I could enjoy time spent in her company.<br />  I thought the writing was clever, and the plot held my interest with its nicely convoluted mystery.  The dash of raunchy sexual tension and heart-wrenching plot developments were also a great touch.<br />     Size-wise Max is closing in on forty and built, in her words, like a fireplug.  And her best (and annoying) friend is rather voluptuous as well.<br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  It was hard not to flinch when thinking about Max's drinking during her early pregnancy.<br />Overall:<br /><br />  I found this story to be a creative hybrid of women's fiction and mystery. Readers looking to be drawn into an emotionally raw, thought-provoking story would be well-advised to search this one out.<br />  Warning: this book has some coarse language and some brief references to homosexuality.<br />If you liked \\"Ain't Nobody's Bizness\\" you might also enjoy the \\"Steph Plum\\" mystery series, the \\"Sam Jones\\" mystery series, the \\"Casey Jones\\" mystery series, the \\"Odelia Grey\\" mystery series, the \\"Women's Murder Club\\" mystery series, \\"Princess Charming\\", \\"Infernal Affairs\\", \\"Plum Girl\\", and \\"Hey Lady, Your Tin Snips Are Showing\\".nes\\" mystery series, the \\"Casey Jones\\" mystery series, the \\"Odelia Grey\\" mystery series, the \\"Women's Murder Club\\" mystery series, \\"Princess Charming\\", \\"Infernal Affairs\\", \\"Plum Girl\\", and \\"Hey Lady, Your Tin Snips Are Showing\\".	2003-06-06

I hope he considers fleshing this story out and writing an extended, more visual version of it for his second edition, thus turning \\"Ten Thousand Acres\\" into the epic saga it cries out to be.<br />  Size-wise Flora was a very sturdy and capable woman who somehow managed to make a living with her own two hands in an incredibly inhospitable environment.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  The modern sentiments thrust into historical sensibilities occasionally pulled me out of the story.  And the dialogue was also noticeably modern for the time period.  It would have added to the flavor of the story had the characters sounded more like the former colonists that they were.<br /><br />  The bouncing around in the story's timeline left me confused at some points and uncertain whether the information presented was historically accurate or not.<br />Overall:<br /><br />  Fans of frontier stories or multi-cultural novels may enjoy this one.	2003-06-06

That's corporate paralegal Odelia Grey for you in a nutshell.  But if you crave a little more information on her you might be interested to also know that she owns a green pet cat named Seamus. (Yes, really!)  And her curiosity, impulsiveness, and a knack for being in the right place but at the wrong time, lead her into some hair-raising situations.<br />  Fortunately Odelia's a sharp cookie and can think her way out of most predicaments, and for those she can't get out of on her own she has a great group of friends to provide back-up.<br />What worked for me:<br /><br />  I had a blast taking a joy-ride in Odelia's head.  She's very perceptive and has a great sense of humor.<br />  The mysteries keep you guessing, but aren't so difficult as to be off-putting to non-mystery buffs.<br />  Her gentleman friend Greg was quite yummy and his appearance in the story offered a nice touch of romance for fans of that genre.<br />  Size-wise Odelia is middle-aged, quite short and rather round. She's been working for a long time at accepting herself, and her support group Reality Check has been very helpful in making that happen. I'm glad that Odelia is starting to speak up for herself and is learning not to be cowed by clothing sales clerks afflicted with superiority complexes!<br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />  I didn't mind it because it's both a cause dear to my heart as well as an integral part of the story, but some folks who aren't into the size acceptance movement might feel uncertain about that part of the first book.  However, size is not the main issue in the second story.  And it's certainly no reason not to pick up this excellent series.<br />  I hate cliffhangers in series, but that's what keeps people coming back for more!<br />Overall:<br /><br />  Packed with clever humor, vibrant prose, sympathetic characters, and brilliant mysteries, the Odelia grey series is the total package and is highly recommended for fans of mystery and romantic suspense.<br />  Warning: there are some steamy scenes here and there in this story.<br />If you liked the Odelia Grey mystery series, you might also enjoy the Southern Sisters mystery series, the Josephine Fuller mystery series, the Stephanie Plum mystery series, \\"Death by Dessert\\", \\"The Gumshoe Girls\\", \\"Lady Blue\\", \\"Teacher's Pet\\", \\"Love by the Pound\\", \\"Etta Mae's Little Theory\\" or \\"Good in Bed\\".rs, and brilliant mysteries, the Odelia grey series is the total package and is highly recommended for fans of mystery and romantic suspense.<br />           Warning: there are some steamy scenes here and there in this story.<br />If you liked the Odelia Grey mystery series, you might also enjoy the Southern Sisters mystery series, the Josephine Fuller mystery series, the Stephanie Plum mystery series, \\"Death by Dessert\\", \\"The Gumshoe Girls\\", \\"Lady Blue\\", \\"Teacher's Pet\\", \\"Love by the Pound\\", \\"Etta Mae's Little Theory\\" or \\"Good in Bed\\".	2003-06-06

Heroine: Average/Plump<br />  Reese Brock appears to have it all: a great part-time job in her favorite bookstore (working under the teeny-bopper-bitch-boss from Hades), an almost completed Ph.D. in History (with yet another boss from Hades, who calls her day and night, and NO dissertation in sight), a loving family (with a mother guaranteed to make a girl neurotic), and a terrific boyfriend (if you really go for a guy who kisses like a gagging goldfish).<br />  What Reese really wants though, is to ditch playing it safe with the bland boyfriend of convenience and the ghostwriting of dry textbooks, and instead pen the succulent novel she just knows she has hidden away in her soul.  And she wants to find a man she can truly connect with, someone who can make her burn.  Someone one like Brian Doren, who shared a magnificently hot New Year's Eve kiss with her two years ago and then promptly dropped out of her life, only to now reappear as the best man at her little sister's upcoming wedding!<br />  Does Reese have the guts to make her fantasies a reality, or will she be forever stuck playing it safe?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  This book was wickedly funny, and the terrific sexual tension was sizzling not only between the main characters but in the secondary romance as well.<br />  Ms. Winters has a real knack for vividly portraying antagonists; you just love to hate them!<br />  Size-wise this is another case of a character being assigned a small dress size size but whose descriptions are definitely friendly to larger women.  Reese thought she was chubby and pear-shaped; the hero thought she was soft and voluptuous.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  The book just cruised along for me until I hit the wedding rehearsal and ceremony scenes; then things fell a bit flat, mainly because the hero and heroine got locked into a downward spiral of juvenile attitudes and behaviors.  Fortunately the yummy ending, all tied up in a pretty little bow, made up for this.<br />  Can I just say that I really hated the mother in this story??

Heroine: Average<br />  Copy editor Nicci Bradford is trying to maintain her sanity in a lonely world.  But it's difficult to do when she's busy accidentally supplying the comic relief in the movie of her own life and navigating through a tricky maze of interpersonal relationships with friends, family and coworkers.<br />  Fortunately Nicci has a guru of sorts to see her through the worst of times.  Whenever she encounters a sticky situation, she simply reflects back on her vast Jackie Chan movie collection and brings up a pearl of wisdom to apply to the problem. And when the going gets really rough, Nicci pops a Jackie Chan flick into the VCR, peels the lid off of a can of Pringles, and flops down onto her futon couch fully prepared to absorb still more wisdom of the ages, as well as a little fat and sodium.<br />  But what should Nicci do when she runs into an issue that Jackie has no answer for?  Say, physically running down an extremely handsome, rich, funny and available business client in the hallway at work?  One who wants to take an embarrassed yet intrigued Nicci to dinner--against company policy?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  The politically, religiously, and culturally cynical Nicci really resonated with me.  I enjoyed eavesdropping on her thoughts as she tried to make sense of a seemingly senseless world.<br />  The author used a soft touch when including some deep subjects in an otherwise light story.  It made for a good balance: I didn't feel like I was smothering in fluff, but I wasn't completely dragged down either. (Well, except for those two crying jags.  But I didn't stay down after I reached the end of the story, and that's what counts with me.)<br />  As a kung fu flick widow I can proudly say that I recognized every Jackie movie mentioned in the story. Frankly, I thought that the film references presented a fascinating way to compare the two cultures which have shaped the main character. (If you are interested in East/West cultural contrasts of this sort, look into the love story \\"Iron and Silk\\".  Though I haven't yet read it I imagine the book is wonderful.  However, I can vouchsafe for the fact that the movie is absolutely breathtaking.  It goes without saying that you can't capture the martial art of Wu Shu in words the way you can on film.)<br />  Size-wise Nicci was your everyday girl next-door, complete with cellulite, which  she didn't think too much about except when she was required to wear a clingy dress.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Nicci is just like any other friend for whom you can see better than she can the choices she ought to make for herself.  This is as uncomfortable to deal with in fiction as it is in reality.

Heroine:  average<br />      Redheaded Daisy Gumm Majesty is not your average 1920s spiritual medium. Rather, she's a canny and perceptive girl who lacks an actual connection to the \\"other side\\", but who uses her unique understanding of the human condition as a \\"spiritual counselor\\" to make a good living for her family, including a young husband ruined from fighting the Huns in Germany.<br />  Unfortunately, Daisy's chosen career is just a tad bit illegal as the police would see it more as fortune telling than psychological and emotional assistance.  Not that any of her wealthy, satisfied (if a bit flighty) customers would ever dream of turning her in, but Daisy's wheelchair-bound husband's new best friend is none other than her own archenemy Detective Sam Rotondo, a cranky police officer who just misses catching her in the act of her questionable occupation with alarming frequency.  But the brusque cop may be willing to overlook Daisy's profession as it appears that her countless social connections would make an excellent unofficial snoop for his cases.<br />  Now if only this card-carrying choir member con-artist can just get past her morally superior ethics and agree!<br />What worked for me:<br />  Sweet and lovable Daisy is just darling, if a bit garrulous!  She's so sincere in her belief that she is helping people that you almost forget that she's truly a con-artist in the eyes of the law.  The rest of the cast of characters are also very real and sympathetic.  I easily could envision before and after \\"the Big War\\" images of Daisy's broken young husband Billy. (Shades of Lord Chatterley, anyone?)<br />  Size-wise Daisy is a bit curvier than is fashionable for the era of boyish flappers, but she doesn't reflect on it very much.  She is like many young women, however, in that she's a bit taken aback when she sees a larger, older woman wearing bright colors or getting down on her hands and knees to play with puppies.  Life as a large woman is a foreign concept to Daisy for now, but she owns that it may become more familiar to her one day thanks to her fondness for her Aunt Vi's fine cooking.<br />  What didn't work for me:  <br />  <br />  I don't have a problem with it, but those who have strict genre preferences might.  This series defies simple categorization having elements of both cozy mysteries and romance, but you could just as easily consider it light historical fiction with occasional dealings in darker matters like the treatment of homosexuals or the suffering of war veterans.<br />  There were a couple of passages that were so information intensive that I felt like I was getting a history lesson, but aside from that it was smooth sailing.<br />Overall:<br />  Charming and delightful, Daisy is sure to please readers of many genres, especially fans of novels set in the Roaring Twenties.<br />     If you liked the Daisy Gumm Majesty mystery series you might also enjoy the \\"Daisy Dalrymple\\" mystery series, the \\"Miss Marple\\" mystery series ,\\"The Edge of Town\\", \\"High on a Hill\\",  \\"A Place Called Rainwater\\", \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\", or \\"Ulysses\\".woman is a foreign concept to Daisy for now, but she owns that it may become more familiar to her one day thanks to her fondness for her Aunt Vi's fine cooking.<br />        What didn't work for me:  <BR>  <BR>       I don't have a problem with it, but those who have strict genre preferences might.

In exchange for a ticket to paradise, Berni must assure that Nellie marries the handsome Jace Montgomery and has the life of happiness that she deserves.<br />  However, Berni isn't interested in playing fairy godmother for poor Nellie, whom she assumes to be a superficial, selfish creature, and makes only a half-hearted attempt at her job before retreating into a \\"life\\" of luxury.  But the spirit is in for a rude awakening when she checks on her charge and realizes not only that she judged Nellie unfairly but that she *gasp* is actually beginning to care for the poor put-upon girl.  Suddenly Berni has to scramble to somehow repair the damage her own selfish irresponsibility has wrought.<br />  Can Berni pull off this Herculean task and bring the two would-be lovers together, or are she and Nellie each doomed in their own way?<br />   What worked for me:<br />        The concept of this story was a fun one.

She's also known to be passionate when it comes to business, yet said to have ice in her veins where the opposite sex is concerned.<br />  But college Master Stephen Konig thought he knew differently, having glimpsed an open, wary, and vulnerable woman when the two bumped into each other on an airline flight.  An opinion he quickly revised upon their second meeting, when he saw the business woman the rest of the world saw.<br />  Bitterly disillusioned by the loss of his imagined \\"goddess\\" and annoyed by the termagant who supplanted her, Stephen sets out to make the pedigreed \\"Pepper\\" Calhoun very miserable indeed.<br />  And if he can just douse the sparks of sexual energy that ignite whenever he gets near her, he just might succeed!<br />  What worked for me:<br />  Pepper was a bit prickly at times, but both she and Stephen were likable.

Ancient buildings like castles and universities automatically bring out the romantic in me.<br />  Size-wise Pepper was a softly-padded average, but rather unhappy with her appearance through most of the story, poor thing.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Perhaps it was a case of too many shades from my own past, but Pepper's low self-esteem really was discomforting for me.<br />  I don't know if it was a question of having had an English mother or that she was just picking up the local lingo, but sometimes Pepper didn't sound American.<br /><br />Overall:<br />  A sweet and enjoyable read, especially for folks who like a British flavor to their romances.<br />Warning: there was one sexy scene, but it was very tastefully done.<br />If you liked \\"The Independent Bride\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Bridesmaid's Reward\\", \\"The Librarian's Passionate Knight\\", \\"The Course of True Love\\", \\"Born to be Wild\\", \\"More to Love\\",  \\"Runaway Bay\\", \\"His Seductive Revenge\\", \\"Carried Away\\", \\"His E-mail Order Wife\\", \\"Dear Cupid\\", \\"Spellbound\\", \\"It Had to be You\\", or  \\"This Heart of Mine\\".ally for folks who like a British flavor to their romances. <br />Warning: there was one sexy scene, but it was very tastefully done.<br />If you liked \\"The Independent Bride\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Bridesmaid's Reward\\", \\"The Librarian's Passionate Knight\\", \\"The Course of True Love\\", \\"Born to be Wild\\", \\"More to Love\\",  \\"Runaway Bay\\", \\"His Seductive Revenge\\", \\"Carried Away\\", \\"His E-mail Order Wife\\", \\"Dear Cupid\\", \\"Spellbound\\", \\"It Had to be You\\", or  \\"This Heart of Mine\\".	2003-05-13

The rest of the family was very likable as well.<br />  The author had a real way with words and was able to pull off some very silly lines without pulling me out of the story in annoyance.<br />  Size-wise Patricia Anne is tiny and Mary Alice is tall and abundant.<br />  What didn't work for me: <br />   <br />  I've noticed this type of scenario in other books besides those by this author, but I've decided to address it here:  Why is it a 250 lb man can be seated in a chair and no one thinks a thing of it, but if the person being seated in that same chair is a 250 lb woman, people hold their breath to see if the chair is up to the job?  I mean, do folks really think that furniture strength is dependent upon the height/weight ratio of the folks seated in it rather than their weight alone?<br />Overall:<br />  This is a cute, light-hearted cozy series with quirky characters and intriguing mysteries solved by snoops rather than sleuths.

Heroine: Voluptuous<br />  High society wedding organizer Lauren Remington's plans for her best friend's wedding have come to a dead halt.  Literally.  Because Henri the caterer has most inconveniently passed away, which means all other chefs worth their salt will be at the funeral set for exactly the same day and time as Betsy's wedding.  The frantic Lauren's only option now is to risk a chance on some low-class food service called \\"Born to be Wilde\\".<br />  Tattooed cookout king Max Wilde can't resist a person in need.  Usually.  But this time the desperate person is none other than Lauren Remington, a woman who once descended from her lofty social circles long enough to crush his heart.  Still, he's willing to come to her rescue--for a price.  Her royal highness must accept the menu he prepares: no samples, no questions asked.  And she must bestow on him a single dance at the reception.  In front of every member of \\"who's who\\" in well-heeled Palm Beach.<br />  Lauren is desperate.  But is she desperate enough to serve up a BBQ buffet and dance with the hired help at the wedding of the year?!<br />What worked for me:<br />  I have a real soft spot for bad guys with broken hearts of gold, so I thought Max was as yummy-sounding as his culinary creations!<br />  The main storyline was very cute, and the subplot of finding the lost sister added an interesting tension to the story.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />   There was a potential mystery sub-plot, but it didn't have enough time spent on it to make it anything more than a footnote in the book.<br />  It took me a long time to warm up to this heroine.  In fact, it almost didn't happen at all.  And I'll never be able to warm up to her mother, tears or no tears.  That gal is just plain toxic to her daughter.<br />Overall:<br />  This fun, light read brought a smile to my face several times.  Definitely a good choice for tossing into the beach bag this summer.

Heroine: pleasingly plump/voluptuous<br /> Textile artist Dodie Layton is under orders from her mother to drop 2 dress sizes in six weeks, or risk losing the chance of being Maid of Honor at her sister's celebrity-studded wedding. Desperate for a workable weight-loss scheme, Dodie will do anything to metamorphose from a dumpy dowd into a voluptuous vixen. Even if it means living on nothing but her mother's cabbage soup, she'll do whatever it takes for her philandering ex to see her looking devastatingly gorgeous on the arm of sexy actor and best man Charles Grey in the celebrity magazine photos of the wedding.<br /> Realizing she can't pull this miracle off on her own, Dodie makes a panic-stricken call to her best friend Gina, a gym manager, and begs her to whip her into shape. The two cut a deal: artwork for the spa's reception area in exchange for a healthier body in a hurry.<br /> Pro-rugby-player-turned CEO Brad Morgan is always hungry for a challenge, whether it's developing a new sports and leisure center or just pushing his injured body to maintain its professional level of fitness. Deciding to check up on his latest and most expensive project, Lake Spa, he's prepared to finally take a well-deserved working vacation. But while there, Brad crosses paths with a frumpy artist-type who has a rush need for a personal trainer. When the health club worker assigned to her falls ill, he jumps at the chance to take on the job.<br /> Brad is supposed to be whittling Dodie down in time for the big day, but he finds he likes her generous curves, her softness. He's drawn to them, to her dimpled smile, and her deep dark eyes. Theirs is supposed to be a short-term business relationship, yet he wants so much more. How can Brad make Dodie believe that he wants her as she is, when she doesn't even know the truth about who he is?<br /> What worked for me:<br /> I really appreciated the quiet humor throughout the story, and found that Dodie and Brad were very likeable people with a terrific chemistry between them. I hated to leave them at the end of the book.<br /> Size-wise Dodie was a bit plump and thought she needed to lose some weight, but all she truly needed was to bolster her self-esteem and gain some self-respect. (In the end, she toned up some, but she didn't drop the dress sizes like she'd originally planned.)<br />What didn't work for me:<br /> We didn't see much of them, but the mum and the ex-boyfriend were easy to hate. I know it's a petty wish on my part, but I would have loved to have had more time dedicated to Dodie's newfound happiness being rubbed in their faces!<br />Overall:<br /> This charming, well-written story was as delicious as the chocolate Dodie craved!

But achieving her goal will have to wait a little bit longer when she finds herself having to move one more time, as the owner of the house where she'd been renting a room unexpectedly returns home and decides to toss her out on the street.<br />  Marine recon Master Sergeant Zachariah Taylor was looking forward to relaxing at his own place during leave.  He certainly didn't expect to find a gold-digging squatter in his residence!  But there she was in all her curvy blonde beauty.  Surely she was up to no good, and had just latched on to his rich baby sister roommate in hopes of a free ride?  Why else would she keep Glynnis' current whereabouts a secret from him?<br />  But somewhere between their arguments over the legality of her renter's contract, and moments of sizzling attraction, Lily discovers a note left behind by Glynnis stating that she was on her way north to meet her new guy's family.  Steamed over the fact that he now has two gold diggers to protect his sister from, Lily falls even further out of charity with Zach when she declares that she'll be accompanying him for the long ride north in order to protect Glynnis from her brother's ire.<br />  Zach doesn't know what makes him crazier, his sole family member going AWOL or this very feminine, luscious bit of cupcake who insists on protecting his baby sister from him.  From him!?<br /> What worked for me:<br />  Lily seemed like a very sweet and savvy gal.  It was fun seeing her try to puncture the \\"blonde bimbo airhead\\" stereotype that the oh-so-sexy Zach kept wanting to cram her into.<br />  I liked the secondary romance between Jessica and her husband, and it was enjoyable watching Lily help bring poor mousy Jess out of her shell.<br />  Size-wise Lily was built a la Marilyn Monroe, who (not surprisingly) seems to be the prototype for bunches of books billed as being \\"plus-size\\" romances.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I'm not a real fan of stories in which the hero and heroine are butting heads all the time.  A bit is ok, but the fact that it goes on for more than half of this book is too much for me, despite the validity of the big misunderstanding that prompts it all.<br />  I felt a bit at a loss because I had wandered in at the tail end of a trilogy.  The recurring characters didn't really click with me because I was meeting them for the first time instead of enjoying a nice reunion with them.<br />Overall:<br />  A solid read, especially if you enjoy having your hero and heroine firmly at odds with each other throughout most of the story.

It isn't long, however, before Sophy makes herself invaluable to the family by saving one member after another from various sad scrapes, despite the interference of her ogre-like eldest cousin Charles and his propriety-obsessed betrothed.<br />  If only Sophy could sort her own life out so neatly, and put the mean-spirited, meddlesome Charles in his place at the same time!<br />  What worked for me:<br />  Sophy is the quintessential \\"modern\\" woman who shines among the wilted wallflowers of her day.<br />  I enjoyed the myriad of amusing contretemps and tempests in teapots which kept me laughing; and the climax of the story was just priceless!<br />  Size-wise Sophy was tall, shapely, and well-pleased with her sturdiness since she enjoyed a life of athleticism unlike most of the ladies of her class.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />     Oddly enough, I enjoyed this book more as a literary work along the lines of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" rather than as a romance.  There were several love stories to enjoy throughout the novel, of course, but I never quite got into the main one, partly because (despite its historical accuracy) I just couldn't quite bring myself to root for a match between two first cousins.<br /><br />Overall:<br />      A wonderful, witty read for fans of sweet, traditional Regencies!<br />If you liked \\"The Grand Sophy\\" you might also enjoy \\"A Civil Contract\\", \\"The Toll-Gate\\", and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".	2003-04-17

Wife of a successful businessman and mother of two young children, she feels as though she is losing sight of herself and is suddenly possessed with a desperate desire to become her own woman.<br />  Because of this, the annual summer family jaunt from New Orleans to Grande Isle takes a different turn from past years as Edna, yearning for something new and different, becomes attached to the resort owner's handsome young son.<br />  Lost and bewildered Edna cannot decide what to do; stay with the man she married, go with the man she loves, or make a new life for herself on her own.<br />What worked for me:<br />      I can see why this story is used in women's studies classes to get a better understanding of life in the middle and upper classes of Victorian society, as well as cultural differences as far as racial and religious background.  \\"The Awakening\\" vividly paints the Deep South's social structure during that era.<br />  Size-wise Edna sounded to be slim to average. Her very good friend Adele was quite plump however, and the author frequently lauded her soft beauty.  (However then as now there was still a sense that \\"big is beautiful\\" only extends so far, as was underscored by a particular passage with a very abundant woman being physically described in less-than-glowing terms.)<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  Edna was the only character who seemed real to me; the rest were cardboard cut-outs.  However this may not be a lack of writing proficiency on Ms. Chopin's part, but rather a way to illustrate how cut off Edna was from others.  People who seemed unreal to the reader may have also seemed that way to Edna.<br />  Personally, I feel ambivalent about the ending.  From an artistic point of view it was quite valid, and perhaps it was socially valid in that day and age as well.  But I couldn't help but be frustrated with Edna for not finding another way to resolve her situation.<br />Overall:<br />  An interesting book for anyone who wants to better understand a well-heeled woman's place in Victorian society, but as a pleasure read this novella might be a bit dry and the ending somewhat unsatisfying.e her situation.<br />Overall:<br />  An interesting book for anyone who wants to better understand a well-heeled woman's place in Victorian society, but as a pleasure read this novella might be a bit dry and the ending somewhat unsatisfying.	2003-04-17

I was so sorry to come to the end of this book, and my first thought upon closing its covers was, \\"I want my very own 'Graces'!\\"<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />    This novel is written in first person point-of-view, a tricky thing since we hear alternately from each of the four main characters.  I found it helpful to mentally assign each woman her own \\"voice\\" so that I could better keep them separated in my mind as I was first getting to know them.<br />  I did wish for a bit more detail about scenery and character development seen through my own eyes instead having it explained to me by the key players.  Essentially, the book reads like a 5-way phone-call between you and the Graces so you may not quite feel you are there with them physically.<br />Overall:<br />  \\"The Saving Graces\\" is a wonderful read for those who savor bittersweet stories about true friendship, and the dash of romance ought to satisfy fans of eros as well.  (I'm definitely going to make more of an effort in searching out \\"women's fiction\\" titles of this kind to read!)<br />  Warning: there is some coarse language in this book.<br />  If you liked \\"The Saving Graces\\" you might also enjoy other stories about friendship such as: \\"Circle of Friends\\", \\"Tara Road\\", \\"Princess Charming\\",  \\"Fast Women\\", and \\"The Red Tent\\".s book.<br />      If you liked \\"The Saving Graces\\" you might also enjoy other stories about friendship such as: \\"Circle of Friends\\", \\"Tara Road\\", \\"Princess Charming\\",  \\"Fast Women\\", and \\"The Red Tent\\".	2003-03-21

No way will she wind up like her mother baking perfect apple pies while small children cling to her skirts.  No way will she get sucked into the local witches' coven just because it's her destiny.  No, it's the stage for Agnes, who is bound and determined to sing the socks off of the auditions board at the Ankh-Morpork Opera House.<br />  Unfortunately for Agnes, this is the century of the Fruitbat and looks far outweigh musical talent when selecting the newest operatic diva.  It's bad enough to be passed over as a lead because of her size, but to have to be the voice behind an unmusical yet beautiful slip-of-a-girl is the outside of enough!  Add to this the fact that the Opera House seems to be haunted by an odd specter who on the one hand wants to train Agnes to sing even better than she does now, but who also goes 'round killing various members of the cast and crew for no apparent reason. And to top it all off, those gruff but lovable Lancre witches have come to town to try and lure Agnes back home.<br />  Whatever is a witch-diva to do?!<br />What worked for me:<br />  I love silliness, especially well-crafted silliness!  This is why my home is filled with books by Piers Anthony, Robert Asprin, Douglas Adams, and Terrys Pratchett and Brooks.  And also why I can recite several Monty Python skits verbatim.<br />  Size-wise Agnes/Perdita is clearly abundant, as is one of the secondary male characters.  However, this book is frustrating in that it is filled with mixed messages where size is concerned.  On the one hand we frequently hear about how long it takes for some portions of Agnes to arrive at any given destination, and also about her \\"great hair and nice personality\\".  And yet there are several instances where you suspect the author is subtly making fun of this type of thinking.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />  I picked this book up years (we're talking a decade or more, here) after my last encounter with a Discworld novel.  Not that I am saying that \\"Maskerade\\" can't stand on its own, but I think it would have helped if I had refreshed my memory on the series first.<br />Overall:<br />  I really enjoyed this wacky story for the most part, and the only thing that brought it down for me was the overuse of stereotypes.  (Not just with the large people, either.  The slender, slinky gal in this book was an absolute bubblehead clich&eacute;!)<br />  Warning:  I caution you, if you aren't in the mood to wade through fat jokes and deal with a bit of weight-loss, if absurd humor is not for you, or if \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" parodies are nothing short of blasphemy in your eyes then you might want to give this book a pass.  But if you adore bizarre humor and want to try and puzzle out the author's feelings toward fat, you might actually find this light reading material to be rather thought-provoking.<br />     If you liked \\"Maskerade\\" and could over look its faults size-wise, you might also enjoy \\"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\\" and \\"Long Dark Tea-time of the Soul\\".inking.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />         I picked this book up years (we're talking a decade or more, here) after my last encounter with a Discworld novel.

So when a filthy young wench appears in his castle's courtyard insisting that she's a lady-- the daughter of his despised but wealthy neighbor no less, Dienwald believes that deliverance from his financial woes is finally at-hand.  All he needs to do is ransom the girl back to her family for an obscene amount of money and all his problems will be solved.<br />  But it will take time for his perfect plan to come together; time that Dienwald may not have because the longer he waits the more opportunities Philippa has to break his head, his heart, or both!<br /> What worked for me:<br />  I've loved medieval stories ever since I discovered King Arthur, Robin Hood, and Ivanhoe, so \\"Earth Song\\" gets points from me just for being set in this time period.  <br />  There were some wryly humorous lines peppered throughout the book that kept me smiling, and of course it was very nice to see a woman escape from a dire predicament for once without a man swooping in to rescue her.<br />Size-wise Philippa was very tall and solid and frequently teased about her great height.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  I realize that the hero and heroine were thrown together, but still they bickered right up til just about the last page of the book.  (And that's a just a wee bit long for my tastes.)  Also, there were a few plot elements that were a bit too transparent, and in a handful of places the writing felt stilted, not at all what I expect from a Catherine Coulter novel.<br />Overall:<br />  Fans of Medievals should enjoy this one, but fans of Ms. Coulter may not find it to be her very best work.<br />   Warning:  While it didn't quite cross the line into full-fledged \\"bodice ripper\\" territory, \\"Earth Song\\" balanced itself precariously on that line.

But I was surprised to find how much pity I could dredge up for young look-a-like mistress Marla.<br />Size-wise Sylvie was slightly plump and feeling frumpy in the beginning of the story, but she shed some weight in order to be able to swap lives with Marla, who gained weight for the same reason. (Ordinarily fussing over losing 10 or 15 pounds and getting plastic surgery would bother me, but I think for the most part the author handled the situation in a rather tongue-in-cheek way and gave society a bit of a thumb-to-the-nose where its beauty standards are concerned.)<br />What didn't work for me:<br /><br />Well, it's a modern-day faerie tale that uses science in place of magic, so let's face it . . . plausibility isn't really a factor here.<br />I hope to high heaven my grown children are never so unobservant or self-absorbed that they cannot tell the difference between me and a total stranger, especially when the stranger has a completely different personality and way of speaking than I do!<br />I wanted to like the husband, and I certainly pitied him, but the vindictive streak in me thinks he did not suffer nearly enough for the havoc he wreaked in the lives of Sylvie and Marla.<br />And you've gotta love a word processor's find/replace tool.

This combination was hard to take even despite the certain knowledge that most of them would eventually become better people and settle down to a more stable lifestyle.<br />  Overall:<br />  Fans of British Chick Lit might appreciate this story of yet another long-suffering Singleton.<br />  Warning: there are some coarse words and sexual references in this story.

Then too, there's the fact that the hero and heroine are a long-married couple.  As a wife myself, I just adore stories about long-time twosomes who still have that magic spark!<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  Short stories aren't my favorite format to read, mainly because the limited amount of space requires authors to heap background information on the reader in large clumps, which gives them a more contrived feel than that of a full length novel.<br />  Overall:<br />  Fans of contemporary short stories and African American romances are sure to enjoy this delicious collection about love, lust, and passion.<br />  Warning: there are some steamy passages, an occasional coarse word, and one weight-loss scenario in this book.<br />  If you liked \\"Living Large\\" you might also enjoy the \\"Tales from the Heart\\" and \\"At Long Last, Love!\\" anthologies.	2003-03-06

But it's work and it keeps money trickling into her run-down home, enabling her to care for her two young sons by picking up the financial slack that her nowhere-to-be-found ex left behind him.  So when Cassie agrees to being fixed up by her workmate (with a younger guy no less) she figures she must be out of her mind!<br />  Mike Felcher, on the brink of financial ruin after having suffered through a five year engagement to the queen of gold-diggers, declares himself through with women altogether.  His job at the airport is less than secure, and he's just waiting for the day his landlord slips an eviction notice under his door.  The last thing he needs is to foot the bill for a blind date, so why he conceded to his best friend's offer for a fix-up, he has no idea.<br />  Mike and Cassie get together and enjoy their evening out, but the spark just isn't quite there.  Still, they discover in each other a new friend, just what these two wounded souls need.  When Cassie needs a hand fixing up her dilapidated home and Mike's worst fears are realized and he finds himself out on the street with nowhere to go, they turn to each other for a satisfactory solution to their troubles.<br />  Can Mike and Cassie repair old hurts even as they repair the house, and give romance one more chance?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  Mike and Cassie seemed to be very sweet everyday sorts of people, and I was glad to see them stand up to their exes. And Mike certainly proves the point that a younger man isn't necessarily an irresponsible one.<br />  Size-wise Cassie was unhappy with her plump form and was angry that she had let herself turn to food for comfort during the difficult years with her ex.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  I prefer a little more action in my stories, so the plot in this one was a bit on the quiet side for me.<br />  And as much as I adore \\"Monty Python\\", its magic really has to be experienced firsthand to be appreciated.

Waiting in line for a bus in a torrential London downpour is no one's idea of a good time, and it didn't help matters when the person in front of her stepped on poor Claribel's foot and injured it.  But a handsome Dutch doctor who witnessed the incident whisked the young lady away in his Rolls Royce to her apartment to clean her up, so fortune must have been smiling down upon her after all.<br />  Or was it?  The good doctor turned out to be as brusque a fellow as any you would want to meet, and rubbed Claribel the wrong way every chance he got! And to improve upon the matter, he was apparently taking over rounds at Jerome's Hospital where she worked as a physiotherapist.<br />  How will Claribel manage working with this overbearing man every day?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  Normally I don't care for books where the couples are always cross and at odds with each other, but this one usually had me chuckling rather than feeling annoyed.  (Though I will say that Claribel's independent streak sometimes appeared more like slight immaturity in the form of contrariness for the sake of itself.  But then, Marc's personality reminded me very much of that of Professor Henry Higgins in \\"My Fair Lady\\".  No wonder Claribel's knickers were always in a knot!)<br />  I've enjoyed medical stories ever since my mother handed down her Cherry Ames books to me when I was ten.  It was nice to pick up another one, even though there was no mystery to solve.<br />  Size-wise Claribel was a tall, well-rounded girl whom the hero referred to at their first meeting as \\"hefty\\".

Her new \\"husband\\", a foul person indeed, is desperately trying to cast her off in exchange for a few cents, and Jocelyn is more than willing to help him complete the sale.  If only a suitable replacement \\"spouse\\" would rescue her from this predicament!<br />  Garren Warrick, Lord Spenceworth, is in deep trouble indeed.  With his father after him to take a wife, and no gentle woman who interests him in sight, Garren is fast becoming desperate.  But not so desperate as to be dragged to the altar by that doxy, Lady Paxton, who had lured him to her bed a mere six months after her husband's death. With the Duke's marry-or-be-disowned ultimatum ringing in his ears, a rebellious Garren finds his luck is changing as he passes by a wife sale during his travels in the countryside.<br />  Content to satisfy his father's dictate by hurriedly purchasing a bride (however unsuitable) he drops the grateful-but-confused Jocelyn off at his country estate and hastens back to London to get on with living his life as it suits him.  But events beyond his control have him returning to his new wife, whom he is shocked to discover is a most delightful and intriguing companion.<br />  Garren Spenceworth would never have guessed that he would find his spouse to be not only six-pence-worth, but completely priceless.  But can he look past her slight tendency towards insanity as she babbles on about being from the future, and find contentment with her in his present?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  It's always fun to see modern people struggling to make sense of their new surroundings when they fall into the past.<br />  Size-wise Jocelyn was unhappy with her new body as its plumpness reminded her of her high school days when she was tormented for being on the heavy side.  Rather than accustom herself to her new body, she decided to make it adjust to her and put herself on a strict dietary and exercise regimen. (I couldn't help but wonder if the young lady from the past who swapped places with Jocelyn freaked out similarly in the future and tried to make her slender new body gain weight?)<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />     Frankly, of all the trials a modern woman would face living in the past, I doubt I would focus on not gaining weight from the rich meals.  Indeed if there was anything to be concerned about as far as food goes, I would be far more terrified of falling ill from it being poorly prepared in unsanitary conditions!<br />  I never really felt I knew Jocelyn or Garren all that well, so had a hard time rooting for them to work out their differences.

We only know that one is \\"plain\\" and the other is \\"lovely\\".<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />     I understand what the moral of the story is, but it seems like this book just hammered it home a few times too many.

But they recognized in each other a fierce need for true friendship and became each other's guardian angel.<br />  The two stood as fast friends for eight years in the tiny village of Knockglen, and when the time came for Benny to go off to Dublin to University, Eve made sure to find a way to be there also, even though it meant asking for money from the people she most despised in the world.<br />  There in the big city, Eve and Benny meet others like themselves and expand their numbers til they are truly a large \\"Circle of Friends\\".  And it is there in Dublin that Benny and Eve discover what true friendship is, and see each other through first love, betrayal, and heartbreak.<br />  What worked for me:<br />    It was very hard not to become involved in the lives of these characters.  Even those just passing through managed to bring a tear or two to my eyes.  And while I was happy that Benny and Eve eventually found their places in the world, I was sad to leave them at the end of the book and would have loved to have heard more about their lives.<br />  Size-wise the women in the story were all very different.  But Benny, the character who was on center stage most of the time, was a girl of good size.  She was frequently referred to as \\"a great horse of a girl\\", \\"a little barrel\\", and \\"Big Ben\\" by the more thoughtless people in her life, and it was impossible not to share the pain those comments brought to her.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />   Usually if there is a problem in the writing craft of a story, I not only pick up on it but it will grate on my nerves and pull me out of the book.  However, Maeve Binchy breaks some of the hard and fast rules of writing, and yet my eyes frequently pass over these occasional technical flaws simply because the characters have drawn me so deeply into their story that I read too quickly to catch whatever mistakes there may be.<br />  It was one thing to leave Benny and Eve knowing that they had more or less gotten their lives together, but I couldn't help but feel perturbed that I was left without confirmation that the most fatally-flawed characters in the book had indeed learned their lessons.<br />Overall:<br />  \\"Circle of Friends\\" is an epic saga about coming-of-age in the sheltered world of 1950s Ireland.  It may be a bit slow-paced for some readers, but I thought it was well worth it.<br />  If you liked \\"Circle of Friends\\" you might also enjoy: \\"Tara Road\\", \\"Last Chance Saloon\\", \\"Having It and Eating It\\", and \\"Good in Bed\\".<br />  Note:  There is also a film version of \\"Circle of Friends\\".<br />  While I thought that the cinematic vision of Benny's story was beautiful to see and certainly very well-cast, the translation lost something when it went from book to screen.  It was unfortunate that the producers felt the need to rewrite the plot into a more pat Americanized version in which they glossed over the flaws inherent in some of the characters, taking away their responsibilities for their actions and making them instead victims of their own destinies.<br />  Ultimately, the movie was a feast for the eyes and ears, but the book was food for the soul.he characters have drawn me so deeply into their story that I read too quickly to catch whatever mistakes there may be.<br />        It was one thing to leave Benny and Eve knowing that they had more or less gotten their lives together, but I couldn't help but feel perturbed that I was left without confirmation that the most fatally-flawed characters in the book had indeed learned their lessons.<br />Overall:<br />     \\"Circle of Friends\\" is an epic saga about coming-of-age in the sheltered world of 1950s Ireland.

Heroine:  plump/voluptuous<br />  Lady Sophia Aberley swore to have nothing more to do with Julian Rexley, the young lord who once broke her heart and left her to face down a scandal all alone.  But fate has conspired differently, for when the earl's younger sister flees from her guardian and turns up on her doorstep, Sophia finds she is powerless against being drawn into Rexley's life once more.<br />  Julian Rexley is fit to be tied when he discovers that his sister Laetitia is in the clutches of that jaded fortune hunter Sophia Morelle, the very woman who once staged being caught en flagrante delicto with him in order to trap him into marriage!  Unfazed by the failure of her scheme, the greedy wench soon turned around and landed herself a wealthy Marquess instead.  And to add insult to injury, the heartless doxy penned an \\"anonymous\\" tell-all book about the whole sordid affair, and even had the temerity to send Julian a signed copy!<br />  This forced reunion between Julian and Sophia has all the earmarks of disaster, but will seven years of harboring hurt over deceit and betrayal melt away in the burning light of their love?  Or will their bitter rancor begin anew?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  I thought that giving both main characters a knack for the literary was an excellent notion.  By reading each other's work, Sophia and Julian were able to gain more insight into the other's true thoughts they might have had otherwise.  The little quotes from Sophia's book, which opened each chapter of the story, were delightful. And Julian's poetry, which heralded Sophia's curves as being more beauteous than Eden, was lovely.<br />  The sexual tension was rather good, but better still were the actual love scenes, which were at once both hot and tender.  Every woman should have praise for her figure lavished as sweetly upon her as Julian did Sophia's.  This book is a keeper just because of those scenes!<br />  Size-wise Sophia was voluptuous-going-on-plump.  And like most women she had her concerns about her lover seeing her body, especially her breasts which sagged slightly from their weight.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  There was a bit more enmity between the hero and heroine than I usually like in my romances, but readers who appreciate a challenging, hard-to-win-over hero will find one to adore in Julian.  (For the most part, I liked him.  But he really was being a bit of a dolt when it came to handling his 24 year old sister, who, spoiled brat though she sometimes appeared to be, did deserve at least some say in what to do with her life.)<br />Overall:<br />  \\"Into Temptation\\", with its elegant prose and sizzling sexual tension, is a delicious treat for fans of Sensual Regencies.

And that was before Angie had discovered that he'd been living with another woman nearly all of that time, and has a family with her!<br />  Sam Holland had waited for years for this moment to come.  Finally he could put the past behind him, divorce his wife and move on with his life.  But things aren't going the way Sam had planned.  He knew there might be some enmity on Angie's part, but certainly didn't expect to be assaulted by her!  No longer the daughter of wealthy parents, Angie can't afford to pay for their divorce.  And Sam can't rustle up the funds because he is saving up to pay for his young daughter's operation.<br />  So a truce is called and a plan is formed.  Angie will live with Sam and care for his young girls until they've put by enough money for both the operation and the legal procedures.  But the more time Angie spends with Sam and his girls, the less she wants to get that divorce.  If only she hadn't already promised herself to another man!<br />What worked for me:<br />  I thought the hero and heroine seemed like real people, and reading about their life in an 1800s mining town was very interesting.<br />  Sometimes kids in romance novels tend to be too cutesy for me, but the girls in this story didn't come across that way at all.  The whole \\"blended family\\" scenario was pretty realistic.<br />  Size-wise Angie didn't seem to have many thoughts one way or the other about her nicely rounded shape, but the hero certainly did!<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  I found the way the hero and heroine clung so desperately to their pride at the expense of their happiness to be terribly frustrating.  I think a prologue showing the brief courtship and stormy breakup between Sam and Angie when they were young would have helped make their anger more believable.<br />Overall:<br />  An enjoyable read for fans of Western Historical Romances...If you liked \\"The Bride of Willow Creek\\" you might also enjoy \\"Beckett's Birthright\\",  \\"A Country Christmas\\", \\"Land of Dreams\\", \\"No Ordinary Princess\\" or \\"The Hero's Best Friend\\".ting.

Her wheelchair-bound brother deserves better than to be fired by the company which caused his accident in the first place!<br />  Strapped for cash and unable to qualify for insurance coverage, Tom Spencer will never be able to afford the surgery he so desperately needs in order to walk again.  So when his former employer, Bainbridge Corporation, takes out an ad in the local newspaper searching for a new heir to inherit the family fortune, sister Pam seizes the chance to right a past wrong, hoping beyond hope that her brash sincerity will win the day for them.<br />  But Pam never reckoned on the hurdles that would be strewn along the path to Tom's future happiness; especially not the clause about having to move into the very same house as the incredibly sexy, utterly cruel disowned heir, Reese Bainbridge!<br />  What worked for me:<br />  I thought the overall premise of the book was intriguing, and the classified ad was a clever way to get all of the characters interacting with each other right from the get-go!<br />  I genuinely liked Pam and could see from the start that she was a good person; one whom I'd want for a friend.<br />  I can't go into it without spoiling plot points, but there was something revealed about Reese's history which I found rather touching.  I only wish I'd discovered it earlier in the story so that I would have understood him and liked him sooner.<br />  Size-wise Pam was a throw-back to the 1950s voluptuous pinup era, with a little extra padding besides.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I wanted to like the hero.  I truly did.  Physically, he was the kind of guy who would knock me right off my feet. ;^) But he was so damaged.. so petulant and unkind to Pam at times, that I just couldn't see myself having the patience to untangle this gorgeous guy from his troubled past.  (I would have gone nuts from having it out with him as often as Pam did.)<br />  Well, I've mentioned before that there is currently a strong trend in featuring virginal or nearly virginal plus-size heroines in contemporary romances.

But at 36 years old, the sweet, compassionate red-head is determined to change all that and start living life for Molly.  She's ditched that low-life-leech-of-a-husband in divorce court; now she's ready to shed some bad habits and a few pounds and emerge from her cocoon to show the world a whole new, amazing, dazzling Molly!  But first, she needs to do her newlywed sister a favor and pet-sit at her honeymoon cottage for a few days.  Then Molly can finally get down to the business taking care of herself.<br />  Ruggedly handsome Rafe Webber, coastal real-estate developer and culinary wizard, likes to have his life firmly under his thumb.  So when his younger half-brother Stuart sends him a wedding picture out of the blue, Rafe is determined to rescue him from the gold-digger who snatched him up while he was away on business.  Annoyed, Rafe makes a quick trip to Ocracoke Island off the coast of North Carolina, with the plan of catching the new bride off guard. But when he arrives it isn't the happy couple he finds but a very annoyed sister-in-law!<br />  Stubborn as can be, neither Molly nor Rafe will leave the cottage and instead declare that they'll just have to try to stay out of each other's way as they share the quaint-yet-cramped quarters.  But soon after declaring a truce, the pair find that spending time with each other is anything but horrible. Molly discovers that sweet and gentle Rafe certainly knows his way around both kitchens and women!  Before long she feels her long-cold heart reawakening under Rafe's attentions, but is certain that he could never want a girl like her permanently. If only she had the courage to take a chance and tell him how she really feels!<br />  What worked for me:<br />  Our hero and heroine seemed to be genuinely nice people.  It was nice to read a romance that didn't have contrived knock-down drag-out fights between them.<br />  There was some subtle humor in the story, with some of the most enjoyable lines to be found in the good-natured bantering between the two main characters.  Although, I must add that I appreciated the rather whimsical pet names as well.<br />  Size-wise Molly was short, plump, and calorie-obsessed.  Fortunately Rafe was able to show her that she was a valuable and desirable woman without losing weight.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />     Despite being divorced, Molly was another one of those fairly innocent plus-size heroines.  She'd had some bad experiences with men in the past and was somewhat reticent about being with Rafe.  Because of this, I felt the level of sexual tension between the two characters was lower than it might otherwise have been.<br />  There was a lot more introspection than action in \\"More to Love\\", so it felt a bit slow in pacing, especially since I'd read a romantic suspense novel just prior to it.<br />Overall:<br />  This category novel is a solid read for anyone looking for a short, tender story about two people discovering love together.<br /> Warning: This book has a couple of sexy scenes, and few curse words thanks to a couple of salty-tongued birds.<br />If you liked \\"More to Love\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Bridesmaid's Reward\\", \\"Runaway Bay\\", \\"His Seductive Revenge\\", \\"Carried Away\\", \\"His E-mail Order Wife\\", \\"Spellbound\\", \\"A Worthy Heir\\", \\"The Legacy Tree\\", or \\"Sweet Memories\\".-down drag-out fights between them.<br />      There was some subtle humor in the story, with some of the most enjoyable lines to be found in the good-natured bantering between the two main characters.

With all the trouble Maddie has had lately, what with her fianc&eacute; secretly marrying another woman, her company going down the drain, and her uncle trying to sell her up the river, the distraught CEO could use a few good miracles!<br />  What worked for me:<br />  As much as I love kilted Highland heroes, I have to say that Sultans are good too.  Ben was absolutely delicious!<br />  Size-wise Maddie's fianc&eacute; was always pressuring her to diet and change her looks, and as a child she'd always lived in awe of her late mother's unparalled beauty.  By the time Ben had found her she was rather demoralized where her appearance was concerned.  Fortunately for her, he was quite enthralled with her curvy figure just as it was.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />     It was hard to believe that the thousand-years-old-plus son of a sultan could drop in on modern times and swallow feminism without so much as batting an eyelash.  Especially when I consider how many guys born in this era still don't get it.<br />  I'll never again be able to read a book with even the slightest reference to the World Trade Center without being pulled out of the story.<br />Overall:<br />     A cute, quick read for fans of paranormals and time-travels alike.<br />If you liked \\"I Dream of You\\" you might also enjoy \\"Say You're Mine\\", \\"Etta Mae's Little Theory\\", or  \\"Dear Cupid\\".	2002-12-19

That, and to be the wife of Chad Easterbrook, the handsome son of another prominent Boston family.  But Isadora knows this dream will never come true, for she lacks the beauty, grace, and poise her lovely sisters possess, and she will never garner Chad's attention by hiding herself away behind potted plants at every social occasion.  Instead, she comforts herself by reading travel books about far away exotic lands, and political tracts speaking out against that hated transgression against mankind: slavery.<br />  After a putting in a particularly dreadful appearance at a party, Isadora is grateful to make the acquaintance of one Lily Raines Calhoun, a lady most anxious to find her son's ship down at the harbor.  Some strange impulse prompts Isadora to lead the elegant woman to the Silver Swan's berthing, but her feeling of goodwill and accomplishment turns to shock when the pair of ladies crash an orgy of Bacchanalian proportions being held on deck.<br />  Fiery of both hair and temper, Ryan Calhoun is a man with a mission.  A man who will stoop to any level to accomplish that mission, including lie, cheat, and steal if that's what it takes to see justice done for his former-slave-turned-business-partner.  Ryan's taken on sailing for Abel Easterbrook under false pretenses, and finds himself on a vessel bound for Rio minus a crewman fluent in Portuguese.  When his employer makes an unfortunate visit to the ship mid-celebration during their first night in port, Ryan is certain he will lose his job, with his mother and some strange dowd in her company at hand to witness his shame!<br />  But to his surprise, his employment is secure, and he finds himself taking the conniving frump on as a hand on his crew after she finagles the translating job from Easterbrook!  The last thing Ryan wants is to be saddled with this blue-stocking female, but he needs a translator and she is more than qualified.<br />  The timid spinster and reckless captain can't help but be thrown together during the long months at sea.  And while Ryan begins the voyage by going out of his way to make poor Isadora miserable, her keen wit and willingness to pitch in with the chores soon win the handsome captain over, and he discovers that they have much more in common than he could have ever dreamed.<br />  Life at sea was simple enough when Isadora was a disheveled dowd, but as she comes out of her shell Ryan sees her for the beauty that she truly is, and is soon faced with the dilemma of how to avoid the only attractive young woman on board a very small ship.  A woman who is rapidly falling in love with him!<br /> What worked for me:<br />  It's always nice to see a well-educated woman in a story, and I had the utmost respect for Isadora's astounding level of education, especially when it came to math and foreign languages, two areas I never really excelled at myself.<br />  I thought it was endearing how our hero, gorgeous though he was, had no fashion sense and couldn't refrain from wearing clashing, loud-colored clothes, an offense made all the worse when paired with his long red locks.<br />  Size-wise Isadora was extremely tall, plump, and unstylish at the beginning of the novel.  However, trading in a life of books for a life spent climbing a ship's rigging caused her to tone up and lose a little weight.  I thought that it was rather realistic, though, that Isadora did not shed her milk-toast personality as soon as she dropped a few pounds.  It took her a lot longer to learn to how to have confidence in herself when faced with members of Society.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  When they say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, they are referring to the title as well.  A name like \\"The Charm School\\" had me thinking that this would be a novel set in Regency London, not on the high seas of the Atlantic during Victorian times.<br />   Isadora began the story as something of a ninny.  Thank heavens her journey gave her some strength of character!<br />  As I've mentioned before, I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes the physical side of romance.  The fact that the hero bedded women other than the heroine in this story bothered me somewhat.<br />  Some scenes in the book went beyond the bounds of plausibility, enough so that it pulled me out of the story.<br />Overall:<br />  \\"The Charm School\\" is a solid read for fans of American Historicals or novels with a \\"caterpillar-to-butterfly\\" theme.<br />Warning: There is some coarse language, sexy scenes, and recreational drug use in this story.<br />If you liked \\"The Charm School\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Accidental Bride\\", \\"The Last Days of a Rake\\", \\"Unmarriageable\\", \\"The Bride and the Beast\\", \\"The Fire-Flower\\", \\"Suddenly You\\", \\"Enchanting Pleasures\\", \\"A Country Christmas\\", \\"The Hero's Best Friend\\", or \\"No Ordinary Princess\\".uld be a novel set in Regency London, not on the high seas of the Atlantic during Victorian times.<br />       Isadora began the story as something of a ninny.

Unwilling to be frightened off by ghosts and death threats, Myrtle is determined to do her best by the poor clansmen left behind by their chieftain, whose diary leads her to believe that he was unjustly accused by the Hanoverian king.  Soon Myrtle finds herself mourning a man she never knew and redoubles her efforts at finding some semblance of justice in his name.<br />  Ian Sinclair, loyal leader of the clan Sinclair could not bring himself to leave his underlings, no matter what edict the English king might declare.  Having staged his death, he continues to lurk around his castle, trying his best to lead his clan at night from behind a ghostly mask.

Can Ian's devastating masculine charms sway Myrtle's decision and save the people from further suffering?<br /> What worked for me:<br />  I always love a braw man in a kilt, and Ian made a fine hero, but I actually enjoyed disliking the villains in this story more than I did rooting for the protagonists.<br />  Size-wise Myrtle was a tall, sturdy, girl but very uncomfortable in her body thanks to growing up with petite, dainty stepsisters who declared her as being \\"too broad in the beam\\" to be attractive.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  I had trouble swallowing the plotline wherein Ian was simultaneously portraying his own \\"ghost\\" and a masked, simple-minded servant.  It ought to have been humorous, but was so far out of the realm of plausibility I really felt it just damaged Myrtle's characterization.

Both are suffering silently through crises of the heart. Both are desperate to escape their pain.<br />  Marilyn contacts Ria in the hopes of asking her well-connected husband for information about residential exchanges between Ireland and the USA.  One thing leads to another and the women decide to swap homes with each other for the summer.<br />  Each makes her escape to a picture-perfect home across the sea, and each woman soon discovers that nothing is quite as it seems, that those impeccable houses hide a wealth of dark secrets.<br />  What worked for me:<br />    It was very interesting seeing situations through the eyes of so many of the players (and there were many in this story.)  Yes, it added a lot of length to an already long book, but had some value in letting the reader see what a tangled web life was for those people.<br />  Size-wise the women were all very different.  But Ria, the character who was on center stage most of the time, sounded to be at the round end of average, particularly by the time she's been married for several years, has had two kids, and become the stereotypical frumpy hausfrau.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />  The story was very long, particularly the first half which took forever building up the history of the characters.  But once you reach the midpoint and the two ladies swap homes, the story just flies from there.  (I was up until 2 am trying to find out how it all turns out.)<br />  Some of the characters were fairly strong, but others were rather wispy and less-than-genuine and ended up taking away from the depth of the story.<br />  And though it may have felt trite in places, I have to confess to shedding a tear or two when things got rough for the ladies.<br />Overall:<br />  \\"Tara Road\\" is an epic saga about friendship, loss, and betrayal, and worth picking up if you can tough out the first half of the book.

What better place for a filmmaker to shoot a documentary about a \\"porn star\\" returning to her roots?<br />  Wedding videographer Sophie Dempsey, the only straight-laced member of a family of felons, is determined to make a decent life for herself-- even if the sheer boredom kills her!  Had she known the trials and tribulations which awaited her in Temptation, she might have fled the scene as soon as she arrived.  Having once been emotionally scarred by a preppy \\"town boy\\", Sophie wants nothing to do with Temptation's Ivy League-type mayor, who insists on playing handyman around the farmhouse where they are filming.  And the added headache of dealing with the actors' egos and her baby sister's antics is making Sophie absolutely crazy!<br />  Phineas T. Tucker, low-key politician who'd rather be playing pool, running his bookstore, and raising his daughter, is tired.  Tired of living with his harridan of a mother.  Tired of stepping into the breach between warring townsfolk.  Tired of being tired.  When Sophie Dempsey and her sister breeze into town to film an audition tape for Clea Whipple (a woman whose cleavage landed a much younger Phin in the emergency room for stitches in his chin), the mayor gets the feeling that the director is \\"devil's candy\\", bad trouble he should stay away from.  But his best friend police chief Wes wants to put the moves on Amy Dempsey, Sophie's \\"ex-juvie\\" little sister, and the mayor finds himself tagging along on a double date just to keep big sister Sophie occupied and out of the way.  What began as an altruistic gesture of friendship soon goes awry, and Phin finds he's drawn to this girl from the wrong side of the tracks-- and wants her bad.<br />  Bad enough to shirk his mayoral duties during election time.  Bad enough to defy his \\"first-lady-of-the-town\\" mother's wishes.  Bad enough to cover for Sophie when a dead body turns up and her name is on the short list of suspects!<br />  What worked for me:<br />  As always Ms. Crusie can be counted on to supply the reader with lots of romances to root for, witty one-liners, sizzling sex scenes (though they may not be lurid enough for romance readers who want the play-by-play), and an unusual cast of characters. This time around there's the nutty council of a dysfunctional town, washed-up thespians, a depressed porn king, and a seriously-dead corpse who knows the meaning of the phrase \\"overkill'.  And, as always, there's the requisite ugly dog.<br />  Sophie had a strong sense of self and was, I thought, a very likeable gal. I loved the scene where she set Phin's frosty mother straight during their little chat together.  And I adored how things turned out for her in the end!<br />   Size-wise, Sophie sounded like she was at the voluptuous end of average.<br />What didn't work for me:  <br />  <br />  I read the sequel \\"Faking It\\" first, so my perception of \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" may be somewhat different than those of folks who read the two books in order.<br />  There were a lot of movie and music references in \\"Welcome to Temptation\\", but not quite so many as in \\"Faking It\\" where I thought it went overboard.<br />  It would have been nice if Sophie had broken things off with her boyfriend before getting involved with Phin.  (Especially, I suppose, from the boyfriend's point-of-view.)<br />  I had to suspend my disbelief somewhat when it came to the murder investigation.  And while it could be said that the killer was brought to some level of justice, it irked me that the police never became aware of what had truly taken place.<br />  As a side note:  I can deal with a twenty year old girl getting involved with a rake in a Regency better than I can a twenty year old girl in a contemporary getting together with a porn king.  Don't ask me why; I have no answer for this.<br/> Overall:<br />  Wickedly tempting with its moments of comic brilliance, sizzling sex, and (though it starts late in the game) an interesting mystery, \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" makes a great bubble bath book.

To test her theory, Etta Mae begins keeping a dream journal in the hopes of awakening her own paranormal powers. At first the venture is fruitless and she considers giving up her odd notion. But before long she experiences a series of disturbing visions that leave her wondering if her experiment wasn't a bit too successful after all.<br />Photographer Tim Cullen is handsome, husky, and new in town. A bad tooth leads him to the local dentist's office, where the young man finds himself charmed by the fiery-haired Reubenesque receptionist. He asks Etta Mae to join him for dinner and give him a tour of the area. One outing becomes two, which soon turns into three. Before long the pair develop a very comfortable relationship. Comfortable, that is, until an overwrought Etta Mae confesses the nature of her theory and experiment to her new swain. And the more she tries to explain her situation, the less the photographer believes her, until finally an angry Tim accuses her of being a kook and cuts their friendship short.<br />With Tim giving her the cold shoulder at every opportunity, what will it take for Etta Mae to convince him of her sincerity? And can she truly make a difference in the lives of the people she sees in her visions, or is she doomed to suffer with the knowledge that fore-warned doesn't always mean fore-armed?<br />What worked for me:<br />  It was a pleasant change of pace to read a story that features both a hero and heroine of a larger size. I think a lot of readers will be able to relate to the way Etta Mae felt about herself in the beginning of the story, and to the way she was treated by her co-worker Denise.  I know I certainly did.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />Etta Mae and Tim were both portrayed as being unfit and unable to really get around, so I'd like to point out that there are also plenty of folks who are fat and fit, such as Jennifer Portnick and Sammo Hung.<br />Overall:<br />This novella is very well-written, and though at first it appears to be mired down in all your standard fat clich&eacute;s, readers who stick with it will find themselves delightfully surprised as the story and characters gain depth with each page.<br />Warning: there are a few coarse words used in this book.<br />If you liked \\"Etta Mae's Little Theory\\" you might also enjoy \\"A Worthy Heir\\", \\"The Legacy Tree\\", \\"Love by the Pound\\", \\"Tales from the Heart\\", or \\"Teacher's Pet\\".nise.

Although she was a deeply-flawed character, I felt sympathetic towards her and was glad to see her finally begin to grow by the end of the novel.<br />  Some other characters worth noting were: Cannie's divorced-\\"turned\\"-lesbian mom, who made a pretty good foil for her angst-ridden daughter by providing an example of a larger woman who's gotten herself together, and the handsome, helpful doctor from the weight loss clinic who kindly offered Cannie his support when he discovered that she was \\"C.\\" from the Moxie articles.  ( I also loved the anecdote about the history of Cannie's odd little dog and how he got his name.)<br />  And how refreshing was it that it was the guy who was the inexperienced half of the couple for a change?!<br />  Size-wise, well... it was hard for me to really picture Cannie.  She described herself as feeling as though she was rather abundant, but then tacked on the fact that she was quite tall and a size 16.  I know that in our society any woman bigger than a single digit size is considered \\"large\\", but I think that a tall, large-framed size 16 woman sounds healthy and lovely, like Valkyrie supermodel and fashion correspondent Emme.<br />What didn't work for me:   <br /> <br />  Some folks might find a few plot points in the story to be predictable and perhaps even a little unbelievable. (The Hollywood scenes, for example.)  But it was all right by me.  I enjoy a big-girl-makes-good \\"comfort\\" read as much as the next gal.<br />  Perhaps not everyone will care for Cannie's constant reflections upon her weight, but her actions and attitudes are typical for a lot of women in Western society, especially when there's some other emotionally painful situation at hand for them to (not) deal with.  And for those who feel her self-effacing is excessive and merely for the sake of drama, I can honestly say that it is not.  This book just barely scratches the surface of that societal condition known informally as \\"girl disease\\". (This is not to say that men do not experience similar feelings.  They certainly do.  But this particular slang terminology stems from how publicly vocal women are with their feelings about fatness, and eavesdropping in any restaurant, department store fitting room, or public restroom will bear testimony to this fact.)<br />Overall:<br />  \\"Good in Bed\\" is a witty, bittersweet Singleton faerie-tale that reads quickly but stays with you long after you finish it.<br />Warning: there is some coarse language, a few steamy scenes, and some discussion of lesbianism in this book.<br />If you liked \\"Good in Bed\\" you might also enjoy: \\"Last Chance Saloon\\", \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\", \\"Jemima J.\\" and \\"Having It and Eating It\\".arge\\", but I think that a tall, large-framed size 16 woman sounds healthy and lovely, like Valkyrie supermodel and fashion correspondent Emme.<br />What didn't work for me:   <BR> <BR>     Some folks might find a few plot points in the story to be predictable and perhaps even a little unbelievable.

It really needed that lightness to counter-balance the anxiety of being single coupled with the fear of dying.<br />  There was a fairly large cast of characters, some of whom I found myself worrying over their lot in life, and others whom I really despised! Ugh!<br />  The plot had some predictability here and there, but I have to admit that the author threw just enough curveballs to keep the story exciting for me.<br />  Size-wise the girls were all very different.  Friend and former roomie Liv was classically Swedish in that Barbie doll sort of way.  Katherine was very slender.  And Tara was a yo-yo dieter who swung from voluptuous to plump and back, depending on how she was feeling about her life. The more her awful emotionally abusive boyfriend harangued her about her weight, the more she ate out of sheer misery, the poor girl!<br />What didn't work for me:   <br /> <br />  The initial shallowness of the character's lives can make a reader want to smack herself repeatedly in the face with this book (and I was reading the hardcover version!)

She doesn't need fancy manners to run a ranch, which is precisely what she dropped out of finishing school to do.  But 'Lilah didn't count on her sickly, curmudgeon of a father raffling her and her farm off to the highest bidder. ...Bull-headed ranch manager Eli Chandler believes there are two kinds of women in the world: the delicate, swooning, marrying kind, and the ladies of the evening.  So where does the shapely 'Lilah Jackson fit in?  With her mannish way of speaking and her oh-so-tight trousers, the girl surely looks and acts like she belongs in category number two.  But as the boss' daughter, just as surely she's meant to be in category number one!<br />  Not that it makes much difference to Eli.  He's had enough of women to last him a lifetime.  His first love he lost to his best friend and business partner.  Then his fianc&eacute;e-of-circumstances was kidnapped from his own home and disappeared into thin air.  And a guilt-ridden, honor-bound Eli has been roaming the country searching for her ever since.<br />  So why does he care how shapely 'Lilah looks in her trousers?  Or whether she'll be auctioned off to the highest bidder?  He's not a free man and has no choice but to continue on his way searching for his lost lady, no matter how he feels about the red-headed, britches-wearing Amazon who insists on running her ranch into the ground.<br />What worked for me:<br />  Eli's history gave the plot an interesting and unique twist to an oft-used storyline.<br />  I liked 'Lilah and Eli very much.  They were a refreshing change of pace from the other romance novel couples I've run across lately, who seem to do nothing but argue with each other.  (That isn't to say that 'Lilah and Eli always saw eye-to-eye, but the initial animosity between the two didn't go on ad infinitum ad nausea either.)<br />  Size-wise Lilah was sturdy.  A strapping young woman who, despite her beauty, intimidated most of the men in the area.  Though her size sometimes had her feeling like a misfit, she didn't mope over it but went about living her life instead.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  I wouldn't have minded seeing a bit more of the burgeoning relationship between 'Lilah's friend Isobel and the farmhand named Streak.<br />Overall:<br />  This well-written story was a very pleasant read and stood well on its own, though I suspect reading the previous title in the Beckett series would prove helpful.<br />Note:  Despite a setting in North Carolina, the cattle ranch piece to this story gave it a definite Western Historical flavor.<br />Warning: there are a few curse words sprinkled throughout the story and one steamy scene at the end...)<br />       Size-wise Lilah was sturdy.

The artist, a guilt-ridden forger by the name of Mathilda Goodnight, realizes her partner in kissing would make an equally excellent partner in crime, and uses whatever feminine wiles she has at her disposal to convince him to help her recover the fake painting she's after.<br />  Nearly-gone-straight con man Dave Dempsey has one last job to pull before retiring: he has to retrieve some money he's lost, $3 million dollars which his lovelorn former financial advisor bestowed upon Dave's ex, a certain black widow beauty queen.  Dave's street smarts tell him to forget the pleas laid on him by the vamp shut up in the closet with him, but in the end it's not his brain he listens to and he agrees to help her out.<br />  What seemed to be a one-time done-deal quickly goes awry when 'Tilda discovers that her attractive new friend has nicked the wrong painting!  Fortunately for her, he didn't get what he wanted either and has decided it's to his advantage to maintain their partnership.  Holed up in her kooky family's apartment building where they are surrounded by an eclectic assortment of tenants (an aging Bohemian with repressed rage and a keen sense of wordplay, a teacher-in-training whose smutty alter ego has a wardrobe to rival Madonna, plus her gay cross-dressing ex-husband and their wise-beyond-her-years teen daughter, a hit man, and a shaggy wiener dog who looks like his namesake Steven Buscemi) Dave and 'Tilda try to regroup and figure out how to reclaim the money and all six forgeries before it's too late.<br />  Will Dave ever bring back the right painting?  Will 'Tilda ever be able to make-out with him anywhere but in a dark closet?  And when all is said and done, will the two of them be able to admit that they belong together like butter on a muffin?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  One of Ms. Crusie's greatest strengths is writing excellent dialogue; \\"Faking It\\" is overflowing with witty one-liners and snappy comebacks.  And readers can always count on her to provide a colorful cast of characters!  (In my mind it's a shame she hasn't been drafted by one of the major networks to breathe new life into their faltering sit-coms.  She's got a real knack for screwball comedy!)<br />  I'm a true fan of romance, and while some folks might find it too pat an ending that so many of the characters managed to find true love, it suited me just fine.<br />  Size-wise, 'Tilda sounded as though she were on the round side of average and seemed to be relatively comfy in her own skin.  (She was, however, somewhat frigid due to emotional issues related to her stint as a forger.)<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I prefer that the romance come before the physical relationship in a story.  This book blurred the line a bit there, having the characters fall in love at first \\"sight\\" and then falling into bed shortly thereafter.<br />  If a reader isn't up on her knowledge of pop culture or the art world some of the references and jokes may go over her head.  And the character descriptions are dependent upon being familiar with a slew of celebrities and movie personalities.  Should the reader not recognize a name that's been dropped, she consequently has very little framework upon which to rest her image of that person.  (For this reason, the large cast of characters with their many names can become confusing to some.  I'll be the first to stand up and admit I have no idea who \\"Vilma\\" was, so I had no strong mental image to call up whenever her name appeared.)<br /> Overall:<br />  This quirky, light-hearted romantic comedy was an enjoyable read that stands alone just fine, but I do wish I'd stop backing into series this way.  I'm off to the bookstore to pick up a copy of the prior novel \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" to fill in some of the blanks.<br />  \\"Faking It\\" had an interesting plot; one intriguing enough that I think it would appeal to fans of mysteries if they don't mind the sensual passages.<br />  Warning: There are some spicy love scenes and some coarse language in this story.<br />  If you liked \\"Faking It\\", you might also enjoy \\"Fast Women\\", The \\"Stephanie Plum\\" mystery series, \\"Plum Girl\\", \\"Princess Charming\\", \\"Infernal Affairs\\", \\"It had to be You\\",  \\"This Heart of Mine\\", or \\"Dear Cupid\\".copy of the prior novel \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" to fill in some of the blanks. <br />     \\"Faking It\\" had an interesting plot; one intriguing enough that I think it would appeal to fans of mysteries if they don't mind the sensual passages.<br />     Warning: There are some spicy love scenes and some coarse language in this story.<br />     If you liked \\"Faking It\\", you might also enjoy \\"Fast Women\\", The \\"Stephanie Plum\\" mystery series, \\"Plum Girl\\", \\"Princess Charming\\", \\"Infernal Affairs\\", \\"It had to be You\\",  \\"This Heart of Mine\\", or \\"Dear Cupid\\".	2002-10-22

Instead of marriage, she fantasizes about escaping from her small town and searching the globe for a place where she can be herself, and practice in peace the art no one around her seems to understand.<br />  But all that changes the day her brother brings home a Harvard classmate as a houseguest for the Christmas holidays.<br />  Handsome Shaun Matheson is as elegant a gentleman as even an artist like Charlotte could ever imagine.  His genuine concern for the put-upon young lady warms her heart, and when his sweet lips salute hers, she begins to think that marriage, at least to this fine man, might not be so horrid after all.<br />  But Shaun, unable to stand up to his heavy-handed father, quickly resigns himself to life without Charlotte, and leaves that broken-hearted young lady behind with nary a second glance.  With no other recourse, disillusioned Charlotte accepts a betrothal from her only other suitor: Giles Williams, the very same bully who tormented her all her life!<br />  In her heart of hearts, Charlotte knows she and Shaun belong together.  But can these two wounded souls swallow their pride, defy their families, and find their way back into each other's arms?<br />What worked for me:... Reading \\"A Country Christmas\\", I felt I could perceive shades of Anne and Laura in Charlotte.<br />  There were certainly a plethora of horrible, hateful people to despise and pity in this story.  (I didn't share Charlotte's type of home-life, but I too had a Giles Williams in my life from the cradle 'til the day I graduated from school, so I could sympathize with the poor girl on that count.)<br />  I enjoyed the secondary romance between Charlotte's bosom friend Sarah and her beau, and wouldn't have minded seeing more of it... And the ending of the story had a certain poetic justice to it which left me smiling.<br />  Size-wise Charlotte was still a plump young girl at the beginning of the book, but by its conclusion had matured into a lovely, voluptuous young lady.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  Perhaps I'm influenced by having read more traditional British romances set in this time period than I have American ones, but I felt the tone of this story lent itself to a later time, perhaps the close of the19th century rather than the stricter, more formal 1830s.<br />  I can't go into it without spoiling plot points, but there was a scene revolving around a winter storm which had a few elements which didn't work for me.<br />Overall:<br />  This well-written story with its gentle humor was like warm gingerbread with whipped topping: comfortingly sweet with a hint of spice.<br />Warning: there are some steamy scenes in this book...ore of it...

Heroine: tall, plump/voluptuous<br />  Interior decorator Lacey Holbrook is in trouble, and she's ready to call in an old favor to get out of it.  She fully expected the Merlin family to make good on her request for a \\"suitable\\" man to assist her, but was stunned to see the heir to the empire himself standing at the door of her trendy L.A. apartment.  Jed Merlin had changed. No longer the clean-cut young man she worshipped with adolescent eyes, this shaggy denim-clad stranger hardly seems like the CEO of a major corporation, and certainly not the answer to her predicament!<br />  Jed Merlin rang the bell expecting to help out an old family friend, but the cool, collected woman who answered the door was nothing like the little girl he so fondly recalled proposing marriage to him, citing it as a merger between their two family businesses.  Irritated with the way Lacey is intent on playing Pygmalion and pigeon-holing him into her idea of an urbane male, Jed sets out to show Lacey what a real man is made out of, turning the voluptuous beauty and her ideals on their ear.<br />  What worked for me:<br />  I always get a kick out of reading older contemporaries because they are frozen in time.  This story has the heroine sporting an easy-care Dorothy Hamill 'do and a silk jumpsuit, which I recall was all the rage way back when the wardrobe on \\"Charlie's Angels\\" was considered the cutting edge of chic fashion.<br />  Though her appearance was brief, there is a secondary character, a writer of bodice rippers, who provides some tongue-in-cheek humor about the romance genre in general.  It's nice to see an author who has a sense of humor about her line of work.<br />  I thought Jed was fairly well-drawn for such a short novel, and I definitely could see myself chatting comfortably with him at a party.<br />  Size-wise Lacey was heavier than was \\"in\\" for L.A. in the late 70s/early 80s, and felt self-conscious about her height around men under 6'.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  I hate to say it, but I really didn't like Lacey.

She's possessed of a nervous tendency towards relieving the people around her of their personal effects. Should the ton ever find out, her chances at landing her suitor, a bland yet wealthy Marquis, will become nil. Worse still, she and her young son will be drummed out of polite society completely.<br /> A trip to the stationer's to buy a pen set for her darling offspring, before he leaves home to attend a young gentleman's school in the countryside, has Elizabeth feeling particularly agitated. On this outing she \\"pinches\\" a bit more than just a trinket, she also pats down the well-formed backside of the tall man in line before her!<br /> Visiting American Wildcat MacInnes realizes too late that his cherished bandolier bag has gone missing, and is certain the soft gentlewoman from the stationer's knows something about it. But of what use would such a thing be to a genteel women like that? The handsome Lenape warrior quickly becomes convinced that like the other aristocratic lovelies he's encountered, Elizabeth is just trying to lay the foundation for a tryst with him.<br /> Wildcat searches out the pale beauty, bent both on retrieving his prized possession as well as taking the lady up on her offer. But he never expected their brief liaison to soften his stoic heart, and soon finds himself willing to do anything for Elizabeth, even if it means going to Newgate prison in her stead!<br /> What worked for me:<br /> Elizabeth's \\"sticky fingers\\" issue was very unusual and made for some creative plot twists. The opening in particular was an excellent example of this, employing both a bit of humor and a hint of sensuality in the way Elizabeth picked Cat's pocket.<br /> Size-wise Elizabeth was quite plump and had no qualms about it other than the pain of trying to keep her stays laced as tightly as possible.<br /> What didn't work for me:<br /> Elizabeth was sweet, but a bit on the dependent side, which really didn't make much sense given her history. (I also didn't particularly care for her other dangerous secret, and found it difficult to see how she managed to move about in Society, even with an Earl on her arm.)<br /> I couldn't quite get into Wildcat either. His character was a bit underdeveloped and just didn't ring true to me, or at least his experiences in London didn't.

A return trip to the same campground years later soon turns into a steamy sojourn when the rains come pouring down and trap the two friends in their tent.<br />  But can Robyn and Erik live with the change in their relationship once the sun returns from behind the clouds?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  The prologue was wonderful; I really could hear the two pre-teens talking \\"at\\" each other.<br />  The love scenes were very sensual, but tastefully done.<br />  Size-wise Robyn was definitely well-rounded, but the author leaves it up to the reader to decide just how abundant her curves are.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Being the talkative, pushy kinda gal I am, I couldn't really get into Robyn or Erik's heads as far as how they came to let their new romance stall.<br />  I know, I know.  There really are twenty-five year old virgins in the world. But it always surprises me to find one in a non-inspirational contemporary novel.<br />  I love details.

But can she take her own advice when the help being offered to her is from the Other Side?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  Although I didn't think much of her professionally, I did like Jane in general.<br />  Size-wise Jane was plump teen who slimmed down quite a bit as an adult, but she just couldn't shake those ingrained put-downs from her slender, beauty queen mother.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  I love ghost stories, but I much prefer the ghost to be a main character rather than a peripheral one.<br />  \\"Plain Jane\\" started out as a romantic suspense, but neither of those elements really came to the forefront for me as the story went on.  Jane never had to pay for the poor judgment calls she made where the bad guys were concerned.  And since my heart never went pitter-patter for her beau Michael, I couldn't really feel the heat between the two of them.<br />Overall:<br />This story of second chances is an all right read, but the heroine's downward-spiraling weight might not appeal to some.<br />If you liked \\"Plain Jane\\" you might also enjoy: \\"Sweet Memories\\",  \\"His Seductive Revenge\\", \\"Dear Cupid\\",  \\"Looking for Laura\\",  \\"Too Much Temptation\\", \\"Walking After Midnight\\", and \\"Shadows in the Moonlight\\".	2002-10-11

Yet she's packed all her things, moved out of her home, and is now hovering on the doorstep of her fianc&eacute;'s Chicago mansion.  It sounds like the perfectly natural thing to do, except for the fact that Kristina has never laid eyes on the man, nor even heard his voice over the phone.  She accepted his surprising proposal only after a flurry of email exchanges!<br />  Handsome Drew Connelly is a success at everything.  Except relationships.  He hasn't managed to connect with a woman since he lost his wife years earlier.  The only light in his life is his family, especially the young daughter who adores him.  Feeling guilty about his frequent business trips and revolving door nannies, he swears to find her a mother, never dreaming that his daughter has taken things into her own hands . . .  with a little help from her great-grandmother and the internet!<br />  Drew meant to straighten things out between himself and the stranger on his doorstep, he truly did.  But he never expected to feel attracted to her, let alone fall in love with her!  Yet no matter how afraid he is of losing his new romance with Kristina, his conscience can't let them live out a lie.  How can he break it to her that he never actually proposed marriage, but wishes with all his heart that he had?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  I liked Drew and Christina as individuals as well as together.  I was really rooting for things to work out for them.<br />  Size-wise, thanks to a mother who can't pass up telling her daughter about the latest diet fads, Kristina really disliked her appearance at the start of the story.  But with Drew's support she was able to begin her journey towards appreciating her ample curves.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Yet another late-blooming virgin.  (Truly, I have nothing against folks who choose to wait.  But it just seems like there's been a high number of plump, older virgins in the contemporary stories I've read lately.)<br />  Aside from a sketchy history, we really aren't given much information on Kristina's background.  On the other hand, there's an overload of confusing information on Drew's wealthy, aristocratic family because this story falls smack dab in the middle of the Connelly Dynasty series.<br />  The plotline is a bit far-fetched, but I was willing to overlook it since I do like surprise encounters in my stories.<br />Overall:<br />A fast, solid read.

As an overweight, graceless child unloved and unwanted by her father, she had it out with him and ran off from home to lead a life of which he couldn't approve.  In turn, the old man stuck it to her in his will by forcing her to inherit his football team (and her teenaged half-sister) for a few short months, to prove that she could really make something of herself.  A mixed blessing at best, since Phoebe loves her little sister, but can't stand football. And she can't stand the team's hunky coach, either!<br />  Stars Coach Dan Calebow is hard, driven, and cold.  How could he be anything but, with a nickname like \\"Ice\\"?  Though dedicated to his sport, he was more inclined to living fast and loose when it came to women.  Dan used to love them hot and wild but a bad marriage and empty, brief physical encounters have left him craving a baby-loving kinda gal who can warm his frozen heart.  But right now his top priority is getting hoochie-mama-turned-temporary-team-owner Phoebe's luscious backside outta the big boss's chair so he can get his team, and his life, back on track.<br />  Can these two damaged souls discover how much they truly have in common with each other before it's too late?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  I must say this is the first time I've ever seen football mixed with romance in a story.  That certainly made it unique and did allow for several funny quips from the heroine.<br />  I also liked underlying theme of healing and bonding, especially where the two sisters were concerned.  (Molly has her own story covered in \\"This Heart of Mine\\", for those folks who enjoy family series.)<br />  Size-wise Phoebe was built a bit curvier than is currently en vogue, a la Jayne Mansfield.  (Actually the descriptions in the book had me picturing the hero and heroine as Tom Berenger and Jennifer Tilly.)<br />What didn't work for me:   <br /> <br />  I've always been a bit uncomfortable with rape scenarios in my romance novels, though in this case the heroine is trying to recover from an assault that occurred years earlier.<br />  I felt that the contrived conflicts made the characters seem juvenile.<br />Overall:<br />  A solid read, especially if you like truly despicable villains and prefer your hero and heroine to be firmly at odds with each other.  A few good comic as well as dramatic moments shine in this story, but it may not be humorous enough for some readers nor suspense-filled enough for others.<br />Warning: This book has some steamy sex scenes and coarse language in its pages.<br />If you liked \\"It Had to be You\\" you might also enjoy: \\"This Heart of Mine\\", \\"Plum Girl\\", \\"Lola Carlyle Reveals All\\", \\"Fast Women\\", \\"His Seductive Revenge\\", \\"Dear Cupid\\",  \\"Looking for Laura\\",  \\"Too Much Temptation\\", \\"Say You're Mine\\", \\"Carried Away\\", or \\"Walking After Midnight\\".om Berenger and Jennifer Tilly.)<br />What didn't work for me:   <BR> <BR>      I've always been a bit uncomfortable with rape scenarios in my romance novels, though in this case the heroine is trying to recover from an assault that occurred years earlier.   <br />       I felt that the contrived conflicts made the characters seem juvenile.<br />Overall:<br />      A solid read, especially if you like truly despicable villains and prefer your hero and heroine to be firmly at odds with each other.

Impetuous heiress-turned-authoress Molly Somerville has had a crush on leading quarterback Kevin Tucker for years, but despite her close ties to his team he's never taken notice of her.<br />  Gorgeous Kevin Tucker has been too busy riding high on his fame as an NFL star, loving the limelight and the bevy international supermodels that come with it to pay heed to the brainy girl-next-door sister of his team's owner.<br />  Thrown together under the worst of circumstances Kevin and Molly are left trying to make the best of a bad mess.  What will it take to make the two of them breach each other's protective walls and discover the love hiding within them?<br />  What worked for me:<br />   As far as snappy dialogue and cute images, there were some great gems to be found in the pages of this book.<br />  Size-wise Molly was neither slender nor plump, but really quite athletic.  Though she experienced some twinges over not having inherited her mother's showgirl body, she was glad for the healthy, whole body she did have.<br />  I especially liked the fact that this story dealt not only with the issue of size but also with age, since there was a secondary romance featuring an older woman (who also happened to have some trouble accepting her body.)<br />  What didn't work for me:    <br />   The initial getting-together of the rather immature heroine and hero felt more like a plot device from an historical novel, and seemed totally out of place in a contemporary setting.<br />Overall:<br />  A solid read.  There were some awkward plot issues, but they may be worth overlooking for the fine humor and the interesting secondary romance.<br />If you liked \\"This Heart of Mine\\" you might also enjoy: \\"It Had to be You\\", \\"Lola Carlyle Reveals All\\", \\"His Seductive Revenge\\", \\"Dear Cupid\\",  \\"Looking for Laura\\", \\"Fast Women\\", or \\"Too Much Temptation\\".	2002-09-30

But which gal is at risk?  And which passenger was hired to send this unfortunate lady to sleep with the fish? The polyester-clad-disco-king-has-been? The used car salesman with the short-lived short-term memory? The fastidious, well-to-do, bird-watching bachelor?<br />  What worked for me:<br />   Ms. Heller's writing gets to the essence of the subject quickly, distilling the key pieces of information and throwing them out at the reader in startling combinations.  It's amazing what she can convey in her effectively succinct yet descriptive phrases!<br />  I loved the tongue-in-cheek humor in this story.  Elaine was the epitome of the catty, witty friend you love to hear talking about others but secretly pray that she never talks in that way about you.<br />  There were a slew of wacky, true-to-life characters in this book with plenty of choices for possible bad guys to keep you guessing.<br />  And I enjoyed the burgeoning romance between the man-wary Elaine and her new friend Sam, but I enjoyed their octogenarian tablemates far more.  We should all be so lucky in our love lives!<br />  Size-wise the ladies were varied.  The main character had some reservations about her six foot height and slender build, but mainly because she had lost her luggage and was forced to wear clothes that didn't fit her correctly.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />    Some folks might not care for the first person point-of-view, but I personally thought it worked very well in this book.<br />Overall:<br />  This outrageously funny mystery seasoned with a dash of romance makes for excellent light reading.

I guess I have been watching all the wrong shows?<br />  I am definitely too vanilla to read this entire series back-to-back, but one book here and there makes for an interesting way to break out of a reading rut.<br />Overall:<br />  Edgy, darkly funny, and very British (not in a tea-and-scones sort of way) this thriller series is the antithesis of the Agatha Christie cozy mysteries.  Anyone searching for a hip heroine who refuses to play by society's rules need look no further.<br />Warning: Very coarse language, graphic violence, casual drug use, and spicy sexual references are the trademark of these books.

Upon being told that her hubby is dumping her for a younger-albeit-toothier gal, introverted Barbara washes down her rage with still more elixir of the vine.  Unable to speak her mind until her husband is well out of earshot, she turns to the stormy night and wishes she was free of her old rundown life.  And in the wink of an eye, her wish is granted.<br />  Barbara wakes the next morning as a blonde bombshell who can suddenly sing on-key, wrap handsome men around her little finger, and sell a house just by looking at a prospective buyer.  So what if this instant makeover has some drawbacks, such as explaining her new appearance to folks who have known her forever, or the fact that her breath inexplicably reeks of Brussels sprouts?  Who in their right mind would want their old life back?<br />  Barbara would!  It soon becomes apparent that her prayers weren't answered by the celestial being she had thought, and new bouncier breasts or no, she doesn't want to be signing on for eternity with Satan.  All Barbara has to do now is figure out where in Banyan Beach the devil is hiding and send him back where he belongs before he turns her beloved hometown into a recruiting ground for the Army of Hades. Can Barbara save her soul and her city before it's too late?<br />  What worked for me:<br />    I genuinely liked Barbara and enjoyed her transformation from doormat to independent woman.  This book had some very funny lines and scenes to savor, and I had a great time watching Barbara try to figure out what had happened to her.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />    I get so tired of the notion that being any size in double digits necessarily equates with \\"frumpiness\\".  Barbara lost 20 pounds overnight and woke up a size 8, so she must have been merely average-sized to begin with.  The mixed message in this book really put my teeth on edge:  bigger women are ok as long as they aren't too much bigger.  And don't get me started on the fact that at the end of the story the (anti?) hero got to keep his paunch, but the heroine was on a diet to lose the double chin.<br />  How could a book that was so well-written for the first three quarters go so far astray at the end?  The climax and resolution of this story just fell so flat for me.  The first attempt to rid this little corner of Florida of its supernatural visitor came off as ridiculous (not in a good way), and the final solution to the town's troubles came off as trite.  The confrontation between good and evil left me thinking, \\"That's IT?!? What was that all about?\\"<br />Overall:<br />    Most of the book was so well-written that I still recommend it as a pretty good read, but only if you are willing to overlook a fat-phobic passage here and there and the disappointing ending.

Can his lordship spend time with the beautiful widow yet stay free of the marriage trap?  And can the lusty lovers survive their hunt, which brings both murderers and the dead alike out of the woodwork?<br />  What worked for me:<br />      The idea of the archaeological mystery had some merit and added a bit of suspense and drama to the story.  I only wish it had been given more time on center stage.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  This book wanted so badly to be a titillating descent into decadence and \\"discipline\\".  It didn't really ring true as bondage and dominance erotica for me, but instead just left me feeling awkward. (Especially the passages where the entire village takes part in the public discipline activities.)<br />  I also felt like I might have benefited from reading \\"The Sherbrooke Bride\\" and \\"Mad Jack\\" beforehand, both of which apparently introduced the characters from \\"The Courtship\\".  Perhaps then these people might have seemed more three-dimensional to me.<br />Overall:<br />  I would have enjoyed this book more had I not been previously spoiled by the author's excellent Medieval and Viking novels.

And, unfortunately, it gives her time to do some snooping around after one of the firm's partners mysteriously turns up dead at the office party.  Can Lonnie find a direction for her life, land the perfect guy, and serve justice without getting herself \\"terminated\\" in the process?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  I don't know what was more fun, reading about Lonnie's yummy love interest or keeping tabs on her life at work.  Twit & Bell has the same sort of bizarre goings-on you'd expect at that other infamous Boston law firm, Cage & Fish.<br />  Size-wise this story is another case of the heroine being assigned a smallish-sounding dress-size, but the descriptive language leads the reader to picture her as being larger than that.  Lonnie loves her junk food, and the poor dear has one of those mothers whose favorite mantra is \\"Your face is soooo pretty, if only . . \\"<br /> What didn't work for me:<br />  I personally didn't have a problem with it, but some die-hard sleuths might be disappointed that the mystery doesn't present itself sooner.<br />Overall:<br />  A great read; definitely take this one to the beach with you this Labor Day weekend.

He even comes up with a nearly foolproof plan to fix the town's money problems.  But Libby's suspicions remain.  This beach bum is no more trustworthy than her ex, and she'll do everything she can to prevent this man from hurting the people she loves.<br />  Can Declan and Libby stop sparring with each other long enough to recognize the priceless treasure right in front of them?<br />  What worked for me:<br />  Declan was delicious!  It didn't take me long to become smitten with this charming black Irish hunk.<br />  Size-wise Libby came across as being on the fuller side of average.  Weight didn't play much of a role in the book, with the exception of a reference here and there that Libby made about Declan not being able to carry her. (Of course, Declan managed it.  Apparently either the hunks of yore were made of sturdier stuff than their counterparts of today, or modern women have a skewed concept of what \\"heavy\\" means.)<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  The pacing was a little slower than I usually like.  And I would have loved to have seen Declan struggle a bit more when trying to become acclimatized to the modern world.<br />Overall:<br />  An enjoyable, steamy read.

On the one hand she purports to be a staunchly independent \\"feminist\\", and yet she is utterly desperate for a man to call her own.  In point of fact, Bridget and her other unattached cronies are all convinced that they'll die alone and will be discovered weeks later half-eaten by an Alsatian.  This desperation tends to drive Bridget into relationships with some real sleazebag losers, which, while doing nothing helpful for her self-esteem, does wonders for her dieting.<br />  Add to all this the fact that Bridget has finally reached that difficult point in life where she has to be the adult in her family.  She has to handle her dad's pitiful middle-of-the-night phone calls while her mum, who left home in the throes of an end-of-life crisis, plays at living a wild carefree life as a television personality with a new youngish boyfriend, all the while trying to throw Bridget at her neighbor's rich, newly-divorced barrister son.<br />  What worked for me:<br />    I totally relate to Bridget's neuroses concerning food and calorie counting, as I imagine millions of other women in the world do.  I also understand her worries about fitting into the world and trying so hard to present herself as someone who \\"belongs\\" appearance and intelligence-wise.  Bridget's attempts at self-improvement in those areas were funny but also terribly bittersweet.<br />  Though it sometimes seemed a bit much, the terse telegraphic writing style lent itself very well to giving the feel of reading someone else's journal.  And it was certainly fun trying to decipher those cryptic entries made when Bridget'd had a few too many!<br />  Size-wise Bridget was at best on the plump side of average, but she felt as though she was much larger than that.  When she managed to shed the \\"extra\\" weight, all her friends couldn't help but ask her if she was ill and where her bosom had gone to.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />  The characters were more like \\"caricatures\\" as they were so incredibly over-the-top in many respects, and at times I found their antics and attitudes wearing. (Well, you know how the psychobabble goes . . if you don't like someone, odds are it's because she reminds you of yourself.  I am fervently hoping that this isn't actually true!)<br />Overall:<br />  A fun, fast read for those who want to have a few laughs and feel better about their own lot in life.  After all, things could be worse.  You could be Bridget!<br />Warning: coarse language and sexual references abound, and if you abhor calorie obsessions, then skip over the headers to each entry in this book.<br />If you liked \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" you might also enjoy \\"Jemima J.\\" and \\"Having It and Eating It\\".hen she managed to shed the \\"extra\\" weight, all her friends couldn't help but ask her if she was ill and where her bosom had gone to.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />     The characters were more like \\"caricatures\\" as they were so incredibly over-the-top in many respects, and at times I found their antics and attitudes wearing.

It is Claire who has made her mark on the world of international journalism, while Maggie submitted her work to third and fourth rate publications. But Claire states that she's getting too old for a jetset life and has moved back home to get back to her roots and hopefully find the man of her dreams, the one who will give her the family she longs for.<br />  At first Maggie is thrilled to have her old friend around, but soon a series of upsetting coincidences leave Maggie wondering if Jake isn't having an affair with the toned and tan Claire, which in turn leads her to consider wandering down the garden path herself.<br />  What worked for me:<br />    The word craft in this story was excellent; certainly a notch above the other chick lit books of this nature.  Some passages I read more than once, just to savor the clever construction of the sentences and the images they portrayed.<br />  As a stay-at-home mom myself, it was easy for me to slip into Maggie's world of diapers and spit-up.  And I completely understood her struggle with feeling herself to be somehow less important than the supermoms who balanced kids with careers.<br />  Size-wise Maggie is never really pinned down to a particular number, we just know that she feels dumpy and requires clothing designed for ladies with a \\"curvier\\" figure.<br />What didn't work for me:  <br />  <br />  The characters weren't particularly deep, but were still fleshed out enough for me to dislike most of them, with the exception of Jake.  I felt sympathetic for him but really didn't \\"know\\" him beyond the fact that he worked a lot, loved soccer, and adored his family.<br />  \\"Having It and Eating It\\" truly lives up to its title.  The book seemed to be meant as a \\"grass is always greener\\" cautionary faerie tale, but the author doesn't really explore the moral of the story.  The reader never sees Maggie paying the price for her poor judgment.  Whether it's with a couples therapist or someone who specializes in post partum depression, Maggie is in need of some serious counseling.<br />Overall:<br />  A quirky, enjoyable read, especially for fans of the current British Chick Lit craze or admirers of well-constructed prose.  However, the plot is so infuriating that you might miss some of those beautifully written passages when skimming forward to find out what happens in the less-than-satisfactory conclusion of this tale.<br />Warning: there is some coarse language in this book, as well as some steamy love scenes.s with a \\"curvier\\" figure.<br />What didn't work for me:  <BR>  <BR>      The characters weren't particularly deep, but were still fleshed out enough for me to dislike most of them, with the exception of Jake.

Why?  Because her last boss divorced and replaced her with a little something in a size two.  So much for investing 22 years in building a marriage, family, and award-winning insurance agency!<br />  The depressed mother of one is egged on by her ultra-supportive-though-equally-off-kilter ex-sisters-in-law to get a job.  Nell heeds their advice and, feeling washed up and washed out, heads for the McKenna investigative firm to apply for a temporary position as a secretary.  Over the course of her interview she becomes a nervous wreck and inadvertently destroys half the office.  Despite the disaster she wreaks upon her surroundings,  Nell is a shoo-in; especially given that the agency's owner is desperate and Nell just happens to be an ex-in-law of one of his biggest clients.<br />  P. I. Gabe McKenna is living his life stuck in a rut.  And he likes it that way.  His office looks the same as it did when it was first established by his father: from the peeling paint on the walls, to the swaybacked furnishings, right down to the picture frames sporting the exact same photographs covered with the exact same dust mites.  He's still driving the same car, a late seventies model Porsche (which was also his father's).  And he's still clinging to a relationship with next-door-neighbor Chloe, his ex-wife of ten years.<br />  From the moment Gabe offers the pale, slight woman the job, he knows he is going to regret it.  Doing a 180, Nell becomes a model of efficient competency and starts making big plans for the place.  New decor, new business cards, new lettering on the windows . . and a new partner:  herself!  Gabe, who dislikes even the most minor breezes in his life, won't tolerate the human tornado that is Nell.  He vows to replace the interfering nuisance as quickly as possible.<br />  But somewhere along the way through murder investigations, family skeletons that won't stay in the closet, a kidnapped dog, and the daily butting of heads, Gabe and Nell manage to ignite a spark of passion between them.  They can make steamy love together, but can they ever learn to work together?<br />  What worked for me:<br />    I picked this story up because other Stephanie Plum fans recommended it as a sassy, funny read.  I wasn't disappointed.<br />  Technically this book is billed as a romantic suspense, but what actually held my interest the most was the relationship between the three highly dysfunctional women (not one of whom was under 30).  I was really rooting for them to all get their lives back on track!<br />  There were some fun references and parallels to old black and white classic films, complete with star look-a-likes: Gabe is William Powell sans moustache and Nell is Myrna Loy with newly \\"retouched\\" red hair.<br />  Size-wise, Nell began the story excruciatingly underweight after eighteen months of not eating, thanks to her husband of twenty-two years up and leaving her with nothing but repressed anger.  Over the course of the book she regains some of the weight until she's a healthier size.  (Though apparently she was a bit heavier before her divorce and opted not to gain all of the weight back.)<br />What didn't work for me:   <br /> <br />   I don't usually care for bed-hopping in my books, but since the hopping happened before the relationship started I can overlook it.<br />  No Maddie Hayes and David Addison here. (If you never caught the show \\"Moonlighting\\", you've missed out!)  The main characters in \\"Fast Women\\" were perhaps a bit too ornery for my tastes.  I like 'em feisty, but Nell and Gabe were control freaks to the extreme.<br />  I won't divulge the specifics here, but the mystery left me with a nagging question or two.  However, I read the book late into the night and may not have absorbed or assimilated a crucial fact here and there due to sleep-deprivation.<br />      <br />Overall:<br />  A funny, sexy, quick read full of quirky characters, snappy dialogue, and a puzzling mystery.  Be sure to toss it in your bag if you have a long flight this summer.<br /><br />  Thanks to this book, I've bumped Jennifer Crusie to the top of my \\"must find more titles by this author\\" list during the current Stephanie Plum drought.  (There is coarse language and some talk of lesbianism in this book, just to warn those of you who aren't into that sort of thing.)<br />  If you liked \\"Fast Women\\", you might also enjoy The \\"Stephanie Plum\\" mystery series, \\"Plum Girl\\", \\"Carried Away\\", \\"Lola Carlyle Reveals All\\", \\"Walking After Midnight\\", and \\"Looking for Laura\\".  <BR>Overall:<br />      A funny, sexy, quick read full of quirky characters, snappy dialogue, and a puzzling mystery.

(Quill, his eldest, was injured in an accident some time before and believes himself unable to father children, since participating in any type of activity involving repetitive motion leaves him plagued with migraines for days afterwards.)<br />   Gabby, young, alone, and aching for love becomes deeply infatuated with Peter's likeness, imagining him to be a tender and soft-spoken gentleman who will cherish her from they moment they first meet.  But reality breaks her heart when she arrives in England and discovers that he is nothing more than an arrogant fop with minimal interest in the fairer sex, except where the topic of fashion is concerned.<br />   Quill sees that Gabby is presented with options which could only result in a lifetime of misery:  return to her hateful father in India; marriage to Peter, who is also sure to tear her down every chance he gets; or be saddled with a cripple if he should marry her himself.  The headstrong financial whiz elects to pursue the last course of action: marry the voluptuous Gabby and take her to his bed regardless of the physical consequences he knows he'll suffer.<br />   Gabby soon falls in love with her handsome fianc&eacute; and will risk anything to help heal his malady, even if it means deceiving him.  But is the cure worth the risk of losing the respect of the man she loves? Or even the man himself?<br /> <br />      What worked for me:<br />    Even though the main romance was an enjoyable one to follow, I personally loved the secondary romance, which had more touches of the traditional Regency novel.  I could easily have seen this storyline fleshed out as a fourth installment in the \\"Pleasures\\" series.<br />    Size-wise Gabby is soft and lush in the eyes of Quill, but appears overly-fleshy to his brother Peter.  For myself, I saw her as looking like Kate Winslet might if she added 20 pounds or so.<br />    <br />       What didn't work for me:<br />    Far more naive than other girls her age, Gabby's impetuous behavior was for the most part charming.  Or at least it was until the climax of the story, at which point she just seemed extremely immature by acting out in the same all-or-nothing fashion of Juliet Capulet.<br />    <br />Overall:<br />    A good read for fans of sensual Regency-Setting romances who appreciate excellent writing.  Though it can stand on its own, I think folks owe it to themselves to read the two earlier books of the trilogy first.  I certainly plan on seeking them out myself.<br />  If you liked \\"Enchanting Pleasures\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Last Days of a Rake\\", \\"Unmarriageable\\", \\"The Accidental Bride\\", \\"The Bride and the Beast\\", \\"The Fire-Flower\\", or \\"Suddenly You\\".   What worked for me:<br />    Even though the main romance was an enjoyable one to follow, I personally loved the secondary romance, which had more touches of the traditional Regency novel.  I could easily have seen this storyline fleshed out as a fourth installment in the \\"Pleasures\\" series.<br />    Size-wise Gabby is soft and lush in the eyes of Quill, but appears overly-fleshy to his brother Peter.  For myself, I saw her as looking like Kate Winslet might if she added 20 pounds or so.<BR>    <BR>       What didn't work for me:<br />    Far more naive than other girls her age, Gabby's impetuous behavior was for the most part charming.  Or at least it was until the climax of the story, at which point she just seemed extremely immature by acting out in the same all-or-nothing fashion of Juliet Capulet.<BR>    <BR>Overall:<br />    A good read for fans of sensual Regency-Setting romances who appreciate excellent writing.  Though it can stand on its own, I think folks owe it to themselves to read the two earlier books of the trilogy first.  I certainly plan on seeking them out myself.<br />   If you liked \\"Enchanting Pleasures\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Last Days of a Rake\\", \\"Unmarriageable\\", \\"The Accidental Bride\\", \\"The Bride and the Beast\\", \\"The Fire-Flower\\", or \\"Suddenly You\\".	2002-07-28

We only hear from the other gals intermittently, and never in the first person as we do with Lindsay.  Because of this I never quite felt connected with the characters, despite the harrowing situations they found themselves in.  In fact, none of the ladies really felt like real women to me.  Stephanie Plum, for all her ineptitude at her chosen career, seems more realistic because I can relate to the way she thinks and feels.<br />  Also, the writing style in the \\"Women's Murder Club\\" didn't mesh with my reading preferences for very detailed and descriptive writing.  This series seems more like it wants to be an updated, feminista version of those stark, old-time gumshoe narratives.  (However, I must add that I am not well-read in this genre, so have few comparisons to make.  The only other truly spine-tingling, chilling thriller I have read to-date is Peter Straub's \\"KOKO\\".  In his case he had the vivid writing technique and character development I crave, but his plotting went astray and in the end he overwrote the book.  Frankly, I'd love to see Mr. Patterson and Mr. Straub team up and write a novel together.  They have the potential to balance out each other's weaknesses and produce an amazing piece of work!)<br />Overall:<br />  The \\"Women's Murder Club\\" books have plenty of suspense and intrigue, and are worth reading if you don't mind plot-driven stories.  I will continue to follow the series, but I sincerely hope that the characters become better fleshed-out in the future.

But can anyone save them from each other?<br />   <br />  What worked for me:<br />    I love tall, dark, and dangerous Alpha males, so Max Zamora was a winner all the way around!  (Of course, he wasn't completely ruthless as was evidenced by his treatment of Lola's little yapper of a dog.)  <br />  Size-wise Lola is a recovering bulimic who has packed on a few pounds to boost herself from vastly underweight to nicely voluptuous.  The ever-catty press referred to her as being very large, but to my way of thinking Lola is built more like Carre Otis than Emme when it comes to supermodels known for their curviness.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />   A few typos and uneven pacing made for a slightly bumpy read.  The story started out with a bang, then screeched to a halt and idled for a while.  However, once it picked up again there was plenty of sexual tension and dramatic suspense to be had.<br />      <br />Overall:<br />  An enjoyable, steamy tale worth searching out, though it may not be suspense-filled enough for some readers nor humorous enough for others.

Even so, she still had a few qualms about the cellulite on her thighs.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />     I generally prefer my fantasy and sci-fi novels to be of epic proportions, as it's very difficult for most authors to immerse the reader in an entirely new and different world in a single short novel.

Heroine Stephanie Plum is from the Burg, a close-knit neighborhood in Trenton, New Jersey where the gals wear their skirts tighter and shorter than their spandex biker shorts, their make-up is louder than their booming car stereos, and their ultra-tall back-teased hair barely fits under the doorways at the mall.<br />  Formerly a discount lingerie buyer, Italian-Hungarian Stephanie falls on hard times and, in a fit of desperation, approaches her sleazy cousin Vinnie about a job as a bond recovery agent at his bail bonding business.  Murder, mayhem, and mishaps abound as Stephanie tries to get her \\"collars\\" and discovers the job is far more difficult when you're the only unarmed person in Jersey. (Stephanie actually owns a piece but prefers to leave it in the cookie jar in her kitchen.)<br /><br />  What worked for me:<br />  As much as I enjoy the zany plots and wacky secondary characters, I think what keeps me coming back to the series the most is Steph's tangled love life.  (It must be nice to have not one but two delicious hunks chasing after you!)  Janet Evanovich honed her word craft skills while writing romantic fiction, so she certainly knows how to spin out the sexual tension between the superbly-drawn characters of Stephanie, Morelli, and Ranger.  In fact, it takes several books of the series before there is any culmination of lust and love whatsoever.  Talk about extended foreplay!<br />  Some folks might not find the mysteries convoluted enough, but not being a Perry Mason myself I like the fact that I catch on to the clues before Steph.  Makes me feel quite the sharp cookie. :^)<br />  As far as size goes, Stephanie lays a few numbers on you weight-wise, but you get a sense that she's fudging them a bit.  There are some characters who have a decidedly fat-phobic view on life but fortunately Lula is there to straighten them out.<br /><br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  Serial writing is a great gimmick.  It's all about leaving the reader hanging by a thread waiting desperately for the next installation in the series.  I was lucky, having jumped on the band wagon late I was able to zip through all of the books back-to-back. Now that I am all caught up, though, I  too shall have to endure the agony of waiting to find out what will happen in the next book.<br />Overall:<br />  Excellent writing, interesting plots,  wildly colorful recurring characters, and an infusion of humor make this series a great joy to read, with each book even better than the one before! Since the novels build on each other it's best to read them in order. Warning: there is coarse language used in these books, and they must be read while eating pizza and/or doughnuts.<br />  If you liked the \\"Stephanie Plum\\" mystery/thriller series, you might also like \\"Plum Girl\\",  \\"Fast Women\\", \\"Lola Carlyle Reveals All\\", \\"Walking at Midnight\\" and \\"Looking for Laura\\".<br />The who's who of the Stephanie Plum series:<br />Joe Morelli: dedicated cop;  known for having the best buns in the Burg.  As the neighborhood wolf, he's had dozens of mothers saying rosaries for their daughters over the years, including Mrs. Plum when she learned that 8 year old Joe had lured 6 year old Stephanie into his father's garage to play \\"Choo-Choo\\".<br />  Ranger:  Ultra-fit, dark, mysterious former military man, now mercenary bounty hunter with questionable side-businesses.  So gorgeous that women walk into walls when he flashes a smile.  Once had to release Stephanie from a pair of handcuffs which held her chained in the all-together to her own shower stall.<br />  Grandma Mazur:  Stephanie's 70-odd year old grandmother, who doesn't look a day over 90.  Likes to wear the same wild clothes as her granddaughter, especially to viewings at the local funeral parlors, which is the main social activity in the neighborhood.  Recently learned the joys of sharp shooting when she shot a roasted chicken \\"in the gumpy\\".<br />  Lula: full-figured former hooker with a heart of gold and knuckles of brass.  Loves to ride shotgun with Steph to pick up skips, but pouts when she is told not to actually shoot anyone.<br />  Mom and Dad Plum: Stephanie's parents.  Dad is retired but drives a cab just to get away from Grandma Mazur and his wife.  Mom is the ultimate hausfrau who lures food-loving Stephanie to the house with wonderful home-cooked meals then subjects her to hours of nagging, which gives Steph an unfortunate twitch in her left eye.<br />  Joyce Barnhardt: our heroine's nemesis who was once caught using Steph's now ex-hubby's backside to polish to the dining room table.  Joyce \\"persuades\\" Vinnie in a similar manner to hire her on as a skip tracer, much to Steph's everlasting exasperation.<br />  Big Blue:  An ancient powder blue Buick with windows like portholes.  Steph hates this car because it's old, ugly, and turns on a buck-and-a-half.  It sticks out like a sore thumb on stake-outs and is likewise useless for tailing people, but on the plus-side it's the only car to-date that Steph's managed not to blow up.l funeral parlors, which is the main social activity in the neighborhood.

In \\"Kennedy's Commandos\\" the ladies take on survival training camp and teach some hard-nosed military men a few new tricks.  In \\"Sins of Touch\\" the girls unravel the threads of a topsy-turvy case involving stalking, extortion, and the shooting of a male stripper.<br />  What worked for me:<br />    I particularly enjoyed reading about the Girls' hijinks in the short story \\"Kennedy's Commandos\\", which was a pleasant introduction to the various women involved in this cadre of detectives.<br />  As far as size goes, it wasn't really an issue in these stories.  Some of the ladies presented were larger, some were smaller.  Some were old and some were young.  All were intelligent, funny, and passionate about their work.<br />  What didn't work for me:    <br />    There were some editing oversights which made for a slightly bumpy read.<br />  The large cast of characters in \\"Sins of Touch\\" was at times difficult to keep track of, and provided less opportunity to develop a rapport with individual Gumshoe Girls as in the less-populated \\"Kennedy's Commandos\\".<br />Overall:<br />     Editing issues aside the stories were enjoyable, quirky, and worth having a look at.  I'd love to see the Gumshoe Girls cross paths with their erstwhile trainers from the survival camp again in future stories.<br />For more Mystery reading suggestions, please click on my name and refer to the Listmania lists in my personal area.	2002-06-06

Heroines:  Varied<br />   Follow the trials and tribulations of Dinah, one of the many faceless daughters of the Bible, from the beginning of her life in the mystical Red Tent of her many mothers, through heinous betrayal, and finally a long-awaited and hard-won healing.<br /><br />  What worked for me:<br />     I found the story to be unique, rich, inventive, and gripping.  I didn't put the book down unless I absolutely had no choice, and even then I found my mind wandering back over what I'd read, trying to piece it all together.<br />  Size was not an issue in the book, but the women depicted were a varied tapestry of sizes, shapes, and colors.<br />  Personally I love birth stories so the fact that a large portion of the book centered on the lives of midwives was a bonus in my eyes.  Also considered to be a plus were the many love stories included.  Granted, I don't care for the notion of sharing a husband with other women, but I understand why polygamy was practiced in those days and it was certainly interesting to view Ms. Diamant's idea of how this particular clan of sister-wives might have interacted.<br /><br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  Because it spans a lifetime some sections of the book required a long set-up, but for the most part the story was so well-written that I didn't mind waiting to reach that next level.<br />  This next part isn't exactly about \\"what didn't work for me\\" so much as \\"what didn't work for other people\\", but it was such a sticky topic that I thought I would toss my two cents in on it:  Before picking up a copy of the paperback, I ...saw several scathing comments about it from both sides of the women's issue.  Many people complained that the women were depicted as being too pagan and given too large a role in the book, while the men and their God were more-or-less emasculated and made into villains.  I have seen other reviews written by people who were bothered with how limited and powerless the roles of the women seemed to be: cook, wife, slave, concubine.  That the women did not design their own destiny but were merely carried along by circumstances beyond their shaping.<br />  For myself I carefully considered each viewpoint, took them both with a grain of salt, and guessed that the answer lies somewhere in the middle.  The women wielded as much power as they could in the limited roles of females in an ancient patriarchal society which was surrounded, and therefore likely influenced, by pagan beliefs.  Honestly, we'll never really have a clear idea of what life was like for the women of the time because most written records don't give much insight in that area, and while there are still cultures in the Middle East which seem unchanged over the centuries we know that they are not \\"exact\\" replicas of their ancestors of millennia past and therefore do not give us \\"exact\\" answers on this subject.<br />Overall:<br />   I enjoyed \\"The Red Tent\\" and found it to be a very thought-provoking and fascinating read.  I recommend it to anyone with an interest in Middle Eastern history or women's issues.  I do not recommend it to anyone who feels uncomfortable with even the slightest departure from traditional and literal interpretations of the Book of Genesis.les of the women seemed to be: cook, wife, slave, concubine.

Tired of being overlooked and underappreciated by clients in favor of his smaller, more heroic-looking partner Clint Randolph, Sam comes to the decision that their next job is to be the last; that he'll find a piece of land and settle down to live in quiet solitude.<br />  Convinced that his size and build have pre-destined him to a life lived alone, Sam is stunned when he rides into Rincon, TX and wins the favor of the town's bright, plump school marm Prudence Hofheinz.  Though he is amazed by their compatibility in and out of the bedroom, the drifter's low-self esteem prevents him from believing that Pru truly cares for him.  Just as the sleuth is wrapping up his final case, a tragic accident occurs and Sam disappears into the night persuaded that the love of his life would be better off without a crippled man to care for.  Can Pru track Sam down, prove her love for him, and heal his many hurts?<br />     <br />What worked for me:<br />  It was truly refreshing to read a story in which both the hero and his lady are plus-sized, and I particularly liked the fact that the other \\"perfect\\" looking characters did not have storybook lives.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  I felt that the fat phobia experienced by the main characters was too modern a sentiment for a time period when a lady of Lillian Russell's proportions was considered the height of womanliness.  I thought that Pru's mere plumpness garnered far too many harsh comments in light of that fact.  And as far as Sam goes, he didn't really come across as being particularly corpulent to me.  At a towering 6'5\\" I imagine he would have worn his 275 lbs quite handsomely. <br />  That said, I do understand that the author seemed to be making a point about how very skewed self-perception can be, and how projecting our low self-worth can cause others to see us in the same poor light.  Still, I think it is too bad that a book which had such a unique beginning changed tunes in the middle to become a \\"slim-butterfly-from-a cocoon-of-fat\\" story. <br />Overall:<br />    Though \\"The Hero's Best Friend\\" was unevenly-written, with some sections feeling more polished than others, it still had many thoroughly enjoyable passages and an interesting plot.  Fans of Western Historicals might like this one, but it may not be popular with readers who are uncomfortable with steamy sex scenes, coarse language, or weight-loss stories.<br />If you liked \\"The Hero's Best Friend\\" you might also enjoy \\"No Ordinary Princess\\" or \\"Land of Dreams\\".low self-worth can cause others to see us in the same poor light.

Will the financier play against the odds, carry out his destructive plan, and risk losing the only woman he has ever loved? <br />What worked for me:<br />  Gabe was very well-depicted as the smooth, gorgeous man that no woman can tie down but whom every woman wishes she could. And I loved Cristina's portrayal as a woman on a journey of self-discovery, yearning to break free from the mold her parents had crammed her into.  The sexual tension between the two characters was absolutely delicious!<br />  Size-wise Cristina was lushly-built, having put on some weight after coming to the decision that being thin was not for her.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />      There's a reason why I don't usually read category romances; namely that they are so darn short!  :^) But on the plus side \\"His Seductive Revenge\\" is part of a series, so perhaps I'll catch a glimpse of Gabe and Cristina in book two or book three.)<br />Overall:<br />     A great read!

Can Summer catch her breath and gather her wits fast enough to discover which side of the law her mesmerizing captor is really on?<br />What worked for me:<br />  I found myself enjoying the suspenseful twists and turns in the plot, particularly the very end of the book when all the loose threads are tied into a pretty little bow.  (This story would make a great Lifetime Movie Network feature.)<br />  I really felt for Summer because of her history of diet abuse. She was once an underweight model, and later was a bulimic, emotionally-abused housewife.  Still, I'm glad that the book didn't dwell overmuch on her past eating troubles, but rather focused on who she is now: heavier, healthier, and proud of who she is. And I just loved the way Summer's curviness was always described in glowing terms! :^)<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />  I'm not generally a fan of Stockholm syndrome stories, although I can understand how Summer came to feel sympathetic with her captor in this particular case, especially once we get to know more about him and the circumstances that drove him to do what he did.  <br />  The concept of the ghost was interesting.  In fact, since the book opened with a scene featuring her, I was somewhat surprised and disappointed that she didn't appear more often in the story.<br />Overall:<br />  \\"Walking After Midnight\\" was a fun read, and fans of mystery/suspense/thrillers should enjoy it.

(Except for those times when she feels she is on uncertain ground with the man in her life, but what woman hasn't done that?)<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  The flow of the writing became somewhat stilted as the story progressed, and I felt that the book was longer than it really needed to be.  With some judicious whittling down it could have been a tighter, faster-paced read. (Note: the edition I reviewed was not the version which you'll find on store bookshelves, so some of these issues may have been addressed in the final editing session.)<br />Overall:<br />  The plot definitely had some great potential.

The townsfolk, assuming she'll do anything for charity since she's an old maid, ask her to organize a meal for some recently-arrived orphans and their prospective new families.  Thea agrees and her tender heart, which goes out to anyone in need, now aches for unwanted six year old mute and crippled Zoe Galloway.  The older woman bonds with the tow-headed child and offers to take her in, hoping against hope that somehow she'll be allowed to keep her.<br /> <br />  Thea's dreams of motherhood are dashed when Zoe's uncle arrives at her Nebraska home and takes the child away to his own piece of land nearby.  Realizing he can't build a house and business while watching over Zoe at the same time, Booker offers a compromise to Thea: be his housekeeper and take care of Zoe for him.  Willing to do anything to be closer to Zoe and Booker, Thea takes on the job. But tongues start wagging, and Major Hayes decides to offer his lovely housekeeper marriage in order to save her reputation from the bitter town tabbies.  Though she yearns for more, Thea accepts his proposal and becomes his wife-in-name-only.<br />  Trouble begins to brew when Booker's friend and ex-army buddy, a Native American by the name of Red Horse, joins the Hayes family in a whites-only hotel dining parlor, which leads to a shooting at their homestead and threats of jail-time (or worse) for Booker from the bigoted Marshal and townsfolk.

But how can he resist the tousle-haired, chocolate-eyed bombshell he just accidentally kidnapped?<br />What worked for me:<br />  Once I suspended my disbelief over the unlikely opening scenario, I found the situation to be quite funny. (Well, it's funny as long as it never happens to me. Heaven forbid!)<br />There's plenty of sexual tension to be had in this Harlequin Temptation \\"wrong bed\\" series addition, and I had a great time watching the relationship develop between Christy and Trevor.<br />I loved the descriptions of Christy: curves-upon-curves, cleavage all over. There was a dress size attributed to her at the very beginning of the book, but it seems like an arbitrary number was picked and applied to her. The phrases used to describe Christy seemed to belong to a woman a few sizes (or more) larger. So don't let that smallish sounding number make you put the book down. If you were looking for a plus-size heroine, you found one in this book. Honest! :^)<br />What didn't work for me:<br /> I couldn't truly get into this story for one reason and one reason only: the hero's name also happens to be the same as a member of my family! That's always a kill-joy. :^P (Believe me though, name aside the hero was very enjoyable!)<br /><br />Overall:<br />  This was a fast, fun read. It's the perfect way to spend a rainy afternoon. :^) (There are some fairly steamy spots, so reader beware.)<br />If you liked \\"Carried Away\\" you might also enjoy \\"Too Much Temptation\\" or \\"Dear Cupid\\".If you liked \\"Carried Away\\" you might also enjoy \\"Too Much Temptation\\" or \\"Dear Cupid\\".	2002-04-03

She is swept back through the years and finds herself lost and alone in the war-torn countryside.  She makes her way to a farmhouse and discovers a gravely-wounded Nazi deserter within its walls.  Her nurse's sense of duty to help all others compels her to save his life, all the while trying to squelch thoughts that this man could easily have been one of the soldiers who captured her grandfather and held him prisoner during his time fighting there as a German-born American soldier.  <br />  Despite their suspicions of each other and the secrets they both hide, Peg and Thomas find they need each other to in order to survive in the ravaged countryside and to avoid being caught by the S.S. which is now searching for the young man,  who ran away from his paratrooper unit after losing his fiancee in an air raid.  The novel chronicles the pair's experiences as they wander from town to town trying to find the impossible: a safe place to live.  The mystery of Peg's arrival in the past is finally revealed to her and she is faced with choosing between returning to a safe life in the future . . . without Thomas, or remaining in the past with him, where she has little chance of any future at all.<br />  What worked for me:<br />   I always enjoy time-travel stories and although most of those I read send the protagonist further back into history, I must say I found the setting of Nazi-controlled Germany refreshing and that the story's plot had some interesting twists to it.  The only other book I have read recently set in that era was a mainstream novel, Remarque's \\"A Time to Love, A Time to Die,\\" which obviously didn't have the happy ending normally associated with a romance story as \\"A Love Through Time\\" did.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  The condensed time-line and some of the plot points bothered me a bit.  I won't lay them out here and spoil the story, but I WILL say that if my husband turned around and fell in love just a few months after I died, I'd be back to haunt him over it.  For sure! <br />Overall:<br />    An intriguing and suspenseful story. If you enjoy time-travel romances or have an interest in the lives of ordinary Germans during World War II, it's worth a look. :^) ork for me:<br />     The condensed time-line and some of the plot points bothered me a bit.

Little does Leo know that Rose has a few secrets of her own! <br />  Bobby is a player who is living the good life dating girl after girl fully expecting to keep on living the way he always has, until he meets Vina who changes his mind about what \\"the good life\\" really is.  She's not even his usual type, but there's something about her that keeps Bobby going back for more.<br />        <br />What worked for me:<br />  The concept of this book was interesting: shadowing the lives of four people over several years as they struggled to find themselves.  And of course given the focus of this website, I liked the fact that one of the heroines was abundantly endowed when she snagged her man.  True she lost weight by the end of the story, but Bobby kept pleading with her to stop losing weight or better still gain some back because he preferred her softly rounded.  (Where are these men in real life?!  :^)  ) <br />  What didn't work for me:<br />    The book was written in a stream-of-consciousness style that felt like a TV movie manuscript, whereas my own personal preference for reading material is a richly-detailed story that really puts me right in the middle of the action<br />Overall:<br />  If you like novels that show the male point of view as well as the female or books which deal with building a new life,  you might enjoy this one.  	2002-03-19

She has very little time or patience for flights of fancy, so when the inhabitants of the cursed village of Ballybliss start blaming strange occurrences in the region on the Dragon of Castle Weyrcraig, Gwendolyn tries to make them see reason.  But her attempts at applying logic to the situation only wins her an appointment with the mysterious dragon,  bound to a stake and left to her fate in a torrential downpour.  <br />  What worked for me:<br />      I love historicals that take place in Celtic lands, so the setting of the Scottish Highlands was a bonus. :^)  <br />  I enjoyed watching Gwendolyn work her way through the puzzle that the Dragon presented her.  I can't really explain the love story without giving away too much of the plot, but suffice it to say that the man in her life was sexy, roguish, and vulnerable to Gwen's abundant charms.  There was also a sweet secondary romance, plus an intriguing mystery to unravel.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  It's the merest of nit-picks, but the hero's name just seemed so . . . unromantic for so dashing a figure! :^)<br />Overall:<br />  A really fun read.  I stayed up all night with this book, which I'd been wanting to get my hands on this book since it was first recommended to me for the Dangerously Curvy Novels database months ago. :^)  It wasn't a Medieval Fantasy romance as the title might lead one to believe, but anyone with a penchant for European Historicals will enjoy this story.<br />If you liked \\"The Bride and the Beast\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Accidental Bride\\", \\"The Fire-Flower\\", or \\"Suddenly You\\".	2002-03-19

Phoebe falls in love with her husband and, desperate for him to notice her, turns to her dear friend Portia and stepdaughter Olivia for advice on how to make him love her.<br />  What worked for me:  Bright but awkward; longing to be elegant but forever rumpled; Phoebe was just darling!  She was uncomfortable with her generous proportions and hid them under shapeless and ill-fitting gowns which made her seem even larger and more ungainly.  Fortunately her friends take her in hand and teach her to make the most of her voluptuous, womanly figure.<br />  I enjoyed the camaraderie between Phoebe and the other girls  (who incidentally also have books about them which round out the Brides trilogy) and I particularly enjoyed Phoebe's attempts to get Cato to fall for her.  There was more than one delicious love scene to savor over the course of this book.<br />  What didn't work for me: Phoebe had three stepdaughters: Olivia who was also her best friend, and two by her late sister.  The smallest girls never really factor into the story.  Phoebe neither hates nor loves them, and it's nearly as though they don't even exist. (Though this is true of most aristocratic households.) <br />  The villain in the story didn't feel threatening enough for me, being more of a weasel than a wolf.  And the hero Cato felt a bit inaccessible to me.  I would have enjoyed more passages from his point of view, particularly his thoughts on Phoebe and her changes. <br />  The witchfinder scene didn't sit well with me either.  One moment Phoebe was in grave danger from the worked up villagers who declared her a witch, and the next her troubles on that head have vanished into thin air on Cato's say-so.  I think there would have been some bad feelings and grumbling after everything that took place.<br />  Overall:  A fun read, and I think I may go looking for books 1 and 3 of the trilogy despite the fact that they don't fit in with my plus-size reading list.<br />  If you liked &quot;The Accidental Bride&quot; you might also enjoy &quot;The Bride and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Fire-Flower&quot;, or &quot;Suddenly You&quot;.hink there would have been some bad feelings and grumbling after everything that took place.<br />     Overall:  A fun read, and I think I may go looking for books 1 and 3 of the trilogy despite the fact that they don't fit in with my plus-size reading list.<br />     If you liked &quot;The Accidental Bride&quot; you might also enjoy &quot;The Bride and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Fire-Flower&quot;, or &quot;Suddenly You&quot;.	2002-03-19

He's definitely someone I'd want to meet if I were still in the market.<br />  And I can certainly relate to some of Theresa's hang-ups where her breasts are concerned.<br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  This book was written in 1984, so the references to the latest hits by Air Supply and Journey made me laugh a bit.  (Took me back to Junior High, too!)  The writing style and pacing of novels has clearly changed in the last 17 years.  I think had this story been written now the author and her editor would have moved things along by snipping out certain sugary, hollow-feeling \\"let's-fill-the-pages\\" scenes.<br />  Also, I have a bit of a beef with the size of Theresa's bosom.  She's described as being a dainty size 9 with gargantuan volleyball-sized 34DD breasts.  Now granted the current craze for breast augmentation wasn't prevalent in 1984 so I suppose DD would have turned heads the way HH or more does now.  BUT, regardless of that fact I can speak with absolute authority when I say 34DDs are not volleyball-sized but more in the realm of softballs. (Perhaps Ms. Spencer originally labeled them as HH but her editor down-sized them?)  <br />Overall:<br />   While I think Theresa's feelings about, as well as the male reaction to, her breasts was overdone there was still some truth to the emotional feelings of awkwardness associated with being large-breasted as well as physical troubles like back and shoulder pain.  I've personally experienced some the same situations as Theresa including being groped in the halls of my high school.  And I can really relate to the emotional discomfort of knowing that softball-sized doesn't necessarily mean softball-shaped. (I can't relate to getting breast reduction surgery, though.)<br />  Despite being slow in spots and overly sweet in others this was still a pleasant read and anyone who makes it to the end of the book will be rewarded with a tender and sensuous love scene when Theresa finally allows Brian to be with her.dness associated with being large-breasted as well as physical troubles like back and shoulder pain.

The last thing she expected to find tucked away amongst Paul's fastidiously folded clothes was a packet of poetic love letters.  Unable to keep herself from reading them, she is horrified when she realizes that the letters were written to her husband during his marriage to her, and that the author is now in possession of Sally's only memento of her father.  <br />  Todd Sloane, Paul's best friend and executor of his estate, didn't particularly want to deal with his late friend's widow when she came storming into his office at the Valley News looking for answers about Paul's infidelity.  He'd always thought she was a flake,  but this accusation of hers made him think that grief had sent her completely off her rocker.  And more to the point, he didn't want to believe what she told him.  How could his best friend betray him this way by not confiding in him?<br />  Despite the enmity between them, Sally and Todd have no choice but to join forces and try to together to discover the whereabouts of the mysterious Laura, and Sally's missing keepsake.<br />  What worked for me:<br />  Sally was great!  I loved her kookiness: the funky hats and weird earrings, the swirling Indian print skirts and a purse that could hold a small Sherman Tank.  She came across as a really earthy and rich personality.  She was a great mom and friend, and I think she tried to be a great wife too.  As a wife and mother myself, I couldn't help but root for her.  I cringed at the thought of living through her nightmare of the sudden loss of one's husband followed hard by the discovery of his unfaithfulness.<br />  As far as body size and image goes, it wasn't directly dealt with in this story.  It wasn't really about a statuesque woman coming to terms with her size and shape, because she was already there.  The only thing that shook her self-confidence was finding out that her husband had been cheating on her.<br />    <br />What didn't work for me:<br />  Todd seemed a bit flat to me.  He was so certain that Sally had trapped his poor friend in loveless marriage that was the result of doing the right thing after a one-night fling.  It was almost as if he was the embodiment of the late Paul's resentments toward his wife. For a guy with an investigative journalism background, Todd certainly didn't invest much time into getting to know Sally for himself in the years that she was married to his best friend.<br />  Of course the time Todd spent with Sally and her daughter Rosie did bring him around, and by the end of the story he'd changed his attitude about them dramatically.  And I'm glad he stopped thinking of Sally as \\"chubby\\" and started seeing her as desirably voluptuous. Still, I was left with the feeling that he just wasn't quite good enough for Sally.  <br />Overall:<br />  \\"Looking for Laura\\" was a solid and enjoyable read with an intriguing mystery, though I'm still a bit agog at who Laura actually turned out to be. was already there.

A uniform which none other than American History buff Emilie Crosse was best qualified to examine.<br />  Emilie hadn't seen her jet-setting ex in five years, but clearly he still had the ability to make her spine tingle just by walking into a room.  Her greatest regret was that their brief marriage was grounded only in their physical attraction to each other, that their wants and desires for their lives were such polar opposites of each other.<br />  Swept back through time by an unusual storm, the unlikely pair find themselves in the middle of an uprising: the colonies are about to declare their Independence from Britain.  A stunned Emilie meets childhood hero Andrew McVie in the flesh, discovering that he has the wants and desires of any other man.  And that his wants are a mirror of her own.  Emilie must decide between the man of her own time whom she once loved but couldn't live with, and a man of the past who could give her the home she always longed for.<br />  What worked for me:<br />  I always enjoy a good time-travel story.  I think it's fascinating to see how modern-day people struggle to get by in a world unlike their own.  Emilie was an interesting  lady and I sympathized with her situation.   <br />  What didn't work for me:<br />  Zane was handsome, but shallow.  Yes, his character did grow as the story moved along but he still had a long way to go even by the end of the book.<br />Overall:<br />  Very pleasant book, but if you are a fan of novels rich in historical detail then this is not the book for you.  While it is set in colonial America, there wasn't much mention of how people lived.  <br />  This is the first book of a trilogy.  The next book deals with secondary character Andrew McVie and his experiences in the future, which I hope to read in my own near future. :^)s with secondary character Andrew McVie and his experiences in the future, which I hope to read in my own near future. :^)	2002-03-19

After a night of drinking himself into oblivion, he awakens to find himself in bed--with Grace Jenkins, sturdy dependable secretary to his grandmother Agatha, the conniving and controlling family matriarch.  <br />  Grace has known Noah for three years, and loved him for nearly as long.  When the opportunity arises for her to be intimate with him it is all she can do to say no.  Though she might want desperately to be with Noah, Grace has too much honor and pride to take advantage of him when he's inebriated.  But much to her wonderment, she discovers that Noah still craves her even when sober.  The two throw caution to the wind and indulge themselves in a torrid affair despite being hounded by family and friends to break things off and return life to its former status quo.<br />  What worked for me:<br />  Generally speaking I don't enjoy reading about heroines who have to be dragged kicking and screaming to some semblance of self-esteem where their bodies are concerned.  But even though Grace did have qualms about her well-padded figure, Noah certainly didn't care to hear them.  Not only does he threaten to take her over his knee if she doesn't stop making derogatory comments about herself, he actually makes good on it!  (And with rather interesting results too . . .)<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />   I know there are 25 year old virgins in this world, but even so I have some difficulty believing Grace's level of innocence.  Was she so sheltered that she never turned on the TV,  went to the cinema, or read an even slightly earthy book or magazine article?  In this day and age it's nearly impossible to avoid having some notion of the sex act, even if one has never experienced it firsthand. (This is not to say that she had no clue what went on between a man and a woman, but it just seemed like she ought to have known a bit more than she did just from exposure to our sex-saturated  society.)<br />Overall:<br />  With a title like \\"Too Much Temptation\\" it should be obvious that this book features many steamy love scenes, (there's some coarse language as well) so fans of sweet romances are well-warned to steer clear.  If you are looking for something spicy and light to read, you might want to pick up this book.  <br />  I would have liked more details in the story as far as character background, but all in all, \\"Too Much Temptation\\" was a very enjoyable read.  I haven't read any of Ms. Foster's other titles but I certainly plan to search out some of her backlist at my local UBS. :^)This is not to say that she had no clue what went on between a man and a woman, but it just seemed like she ought to have known a bit more than she did just from exposure to our sex-saturated  society.)<br />Overall:<BR>     With a title like \\"Too Much Temptation\\" it should be obvious that this book features many steamy love scenes, (there's some coarse language as well) so fans of sweet romances are well-warned to steer clear.

The real test comes when the attraction and tenuous bond these two created during their courtship has to withstand the loss of her oil money and the revelation of his true background.<br />What worked for me:<br />Cessy seemed very real to me; she was a passionate and sweet lady who was overlooked by potential suitors because she wasn't a knock-out and had a tendency towards bossiness. And despite the fact that Tom was a gold-digger, I didn't dislike him for it. He never once had plans to leave Cessy or set up himself up with a mistress. He intended all along to be the best of husbands to her.<br /> There was not one secondary romance in this story, but two! I do wonder if Cessy could actually have had a friend like Muna, a girl of Syrian descent, in the early 1900's. Despite being a bit P.C. this romance did add some humor to the story, and I enjoyed Muna and her fiance immensely. I also liked the neat and tidy epilogue at the end which ties Muna and Cessy together as sisters by law and not just spirit. :^) The other romance, which flourished between Cessy's father and a local madam, didn't do as much for me but was still sweet in its own way.<br /> What didn't work for me:<br /> King Calhoun had a daughter named Princess, and a girlfriend named Queenie. I was terribly disappointed that Tom's name didn't turn out to be Duke. *L*<br />Overall:<br />I don't generally go for American or Western settings, but I enjoyed this sweet and sexy story anyway. The characters were fun, and it was a nice twist on the Regency fortune-hunter stories I have read. :^)>Overall:<br />I don't generally go for American or Western settings, but I enjoyed this sweet and sexy story anyway.

Heroine: Abundant, loses weight, then regains some<br />  Overweight Jemima Jones is sure her life will get better just as soon as she is thin.  She'll get promoted out of the \\"Top Tips\\" section of the rinky-dink newspaper she works for.  Her flashy flat-mates will stop walking all over her. And she'll have men groveling at her feet.  Especially her gorgeous co-worker Ben Williams.<br />  But she never seems to find the motivation she needs to drop the pounds, not even in the glossy fashion magazines she pores over every chance she gets.  Until she has an epiphany of sorts:  the man she's been chatting up online, the one to whom she sent that seriously computer-retouched photo, wants to meet her face-to-face!!  <br />  Jemima under-eats and over-exercises to shed the weight in a hurry.  And from the cocoon of fat emerges a tan and toned hard-bodied glamour gal.  J.J (Jemima doesn't suit her any longer)  revels in her new status as one of the \\"beautiful people.\\"  But will she be able to keep the weight off?  <br />  What worked for me:<br />  Jemima's life at the opening of the book certainly struck a chord with me, as I think it will with most women: The guilt over eating anything with even a smidge of fat.  The belief that life will start when the weight comes off.  The feeling that somehow thinner people are better than you.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />  The book flips back and forth from Jemima's point of view to that of some omniscient narrator, but since there is no real warning for the change-over it can be a bit disconcerting as you're reading along.<br />   I don't care how much one exercises, you lose one hundred pounds in a hurry you're going to have loose skin folds, at the bust line at the very least!<br />  Jemima does eventually decide that rather than continue to over-exercise and under-eat, she'll just let her weight settle where it may.  But at the end of the book she's still rather thin since she only just made this decision.  And the guy she just landed got together with her while she was, because she was, slender.  Given that most of J.J.'s friends and love interests valued her most when she lost the weight, will she then lose her social circle and her man if she gains some weight back as she plans? And will she still be able to make things happen for herself if she is no longer the ultra-slender J.J., or will she go back to being put-upon Jemima?  (I would think some serious counseling is in order to help J.J./Jemima resolve whatever drove her to abuse herself the way she did both before and after her weight-loss.)<br />Overall:<br />  The \\"moral of the story\\" perhaps hits the reader a bit too hard on the head, and the ending was somewhat predictable but getting there was very interesting and entertaining.  A solid read and worth searching out. :^)ade this decision.  And the guy she just landed got together with her while she was, because she was, slender.

(I would think some serious counseling is in order to help J.J./Jemima resolve whatever drove her to abuse herself the way she did both before and after her weight-loss.)<br />Overall:<BR>     The \\"moral of the story\\" perhaps hits the reader a bit too hard on the head, and the ending was somewhat predictable but getting there was very interesting and entertaining.  A solid read and worth searching out. :^)	2002-03-19

(Think Renee Russo meets Marilyn Monroe.) Give her a messy divorce from an apathetic husband, and threaten to take away her job--the only way for her to provide for her sickly young son. When her confidence is sufficiently shaken, put her in airport full of men she'll never see again and watch this normally self-assured and self-possessed woman test herself to see if she's still got \\"IT\\" by using one of the oldest tricks in the book: a very hot variation on the old bump-into-a-gorgeous-guy-and-dump-your-purse-at-his-feet stunt.<br /> Now take one haplessly unaware handsome man and put him in Kate's cross-hairs. Special effects wizard Mike Cameron (a Kevin Costner/Judge Reinhold amalgam) is simply minding his own business while waiting for his flight, reflecting upon the state of his long-term bachelorhood and finding it somewhat lacking. For the first time in his life he's giving serious thought to settling down. But how does he go about finding the right woman for himself? It's not as though she'll just fall into his lap, right?<br /> What worked for me:<br />  This was a fun couple; I really liked the interaction between Kate and Mike. Kate had no qualms about possessing such a classically feminine shape, and seemed very comfortable with herself. Mike certainly loved the way she looked... Watching Mike pursue Kate was very enjoyable. I know I certainly wouldn't mind having a man like that chase after me!<br /> There was also a very sweet secondary romance which I think might be interesting to explore as a prequel to this book, as well as potential for turning Kate into Cupid a few more times for Mike's three sisters.<br /> What didn't work for me:<br />  Kate was understandably skittish about getting into a relationship again, especially since doing so put her young son's heart at risk as much as it did hers. But it still took her an _awfully_ long time to give in to her feelings.<br /><br /> Overall:<br /> I really loved this book! It was fresh and funny with a unique approach. The little \\"Dear Cupid\\" letters at the opening of each chapter were wonderful, and the one at the end of the book was the best of all. :^) A great bubble bath book, but be forewarned that you'll spend a lot of time laughing so beware the danger of drowning yourself during a giggle fit.long time to give in to her feelings. <BR> <BR> Overall:<BR> I really loved this book!

Heroine: soft, ripe<br />  Cavalier Gideon Hawkes has returned to England after an extended absence, prepared to retake his family's ancestral home at whatever the cost.  Stopping in at a London tavern for some supper he makes the decision to bed one of the wenches there.  His choice? Sweet young Mary Monk who, having been rendered homeless and orphaned after the Great Fire and horrifying plague, has made the painful decision to sacrifice her virtue in exchange for survival.  But what was meant to be a quick romp for Gideon instead becomes a lasting relationship as he offers Mary his protection.<br />  As the mistress of a powerful and rich man, Mary flourishes.  While never really a beauty she still manages to catch the eye of many a man, including the King himself.  This suits Gideon just fine as he intends to see her settled with a new protector as soon as he can bring his plan to fruition: to woo and marry the lovely puritan Celeste Southern, new owner of his family's estate.  But there is a complication: poor Mary has fallen deeply in love with her paramour! <br />  What worked for me:<br />  The setting of the story was an interesting one: the Restoration, after the civil war during which Cromwell imposed his harsh religious standards on the people of England.  (I love novels set in the past.  It's the most painless history lesson you'll ever receive!)  The characters were all well-fleshed out for the reader, even the supporting ones.  There are several to feel sympathetic toward, and a few to despise.  And the education of Mary, a sheltered respectable tradesman's daughter, in the ways of being a wealthy man's mistress was a treat.<br />  The tension in the book in the book was great.  As the story moves forward you can't help but feel frustration at the fact that Gideon does not realize that he could have a very happy life with Mary.  And there are several plot twists which serve to keep the tension building:  Mary's introduction at Court, which earns her a powerful enemy; the accidental meeting between Mary-the-mistress and Celeste-the-betrothed; and the dear friend who wishes to become Mary's new lover, but would put his life in peril if he ever said so out loud. <br />  As far as Mary's size goes, she was never described as being large.  However, she didn't fit in with the particular beauty standard of the day either, as Celeste Southern did.  Celeste was tall, willowy, and lily-skinned (think Michelle Pfeiffer.)  Mary was dark, nearly sallow-skinned, and fairly compact in build.<br />What didn't work for me:    <br />  Since this is an older novel, the pacing may seem somewhat slower than more current books to some readers.  However, speaking for myself I didn't find this to be a problem.<br />Overall:<br />    Fans of historicals shouldn't miss this one!  It's an older title and out of print, but well-worth scouring the used bookstore shelves or online auctions for. <br />If you liked \\"The Fire-Flower\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Bride and the Beast\\", \\"The Accidental Bride\\", or \\"Suddenly You\\".hich earns her a powerful enemy; the accidental meeting between Mary-the-mistress and Celeste-the-betrothed; and the dear friend who wishes to become Mary's new lover, but would put his life in peril if he ever said so out loud. <br />      As far as Mary's size goes, she was never described as being large.

Heroine: self-described as voluptuous on her good days, plump on the rest<br />  I'm a sucker for Historical romances, particularly if they have a British or Celtic setting.  Show me a book cover with a brawny man in a kilt or a suit of armor, and I'll show you my wallet. :^)  This particular story takes place in London during those years between the end of the Regency period and the beginning of the Victorian era.  There are no kilts unfortunately, but at least our hero, Jack Devlin, is half-Irish and a devilishly handsome man with a dark and mysterious past.  <br />  Our heroine is virginal old maid Amanda Briars, a novelist who lives alone after having cared for her ailing parents during their last years.  Normally when in her right mind, she's a pattern-card of propriety.  Her impending birthday however, has her feeling less than her usual self.  She does the unthinkable and approaches a notorious madam in order to procure 'company' for her 30th birthday.  On the appointed night she opens the door to find the devastatingly gorgeous Jack standing before her, never suspecting the real reason for his being there. <br />  What worked for me:<br />  More than anything, I loved reading about a heroine I could relate to attitude and shape-wise.  She sounds to be as short and round as I am, yet the author never portrays her as frumpy and dumpy unless it's from Amanda's own viewpoint.  Some of the wonderfully descriptive phrases Ms. Kleypas used to portray Amanda: ripe, like a hothouse peach;  plump, perfectly so;  abundant.<br />  Another thing about Amanda that I liked was the fact that she always seemed to be cold.  It just made her seem that much more real to me, that she had that particular quirk.  (And yes, this too is something I can relate to.)<br />  I adored the way Jack went after Amanda; desirous of her extremely curvaceous body, yes, but also drawn to her keen intellect and sharp wit.  Their banter was enjoyable, and their love scenes were wonderful; very sensual, but tastefully done rather than becoming all-out erotica. Still, I was grateful that I had the A/C on as I was reading some of those passages.<br />What didn't work for me:<br />  There were times that the standard romantic fiction 'formula' showed through in the writing, and that jolted me a bit:  Insert hero's devastating past here, add heroine's introspection here, time for the forced marriage, etc etc.<br />  I understand with a name like \\"Briars\\" that virginal Amanda would be 'prickly,' but for me there was a bit too much  missishness in her character and it slowed down the story for the sake of creating friction between hero and heroine.  I also had some trouble understanding how she wrote books that were on the fringe of acceptable when she had never been with a man.  True, the books were meant to show what deep-down she wished to experience, but how could she express these ideas if she really didn't understand what she was missing?<br />Overall:<br />  A good read. There were some interesting twists in the plotline, particularly how Jack and Amanda came to meet, as well as the ensuing problems from that first meeting.  In my opinion \\"Suddenly You\\" is worth keeping for those days I feel plump rather than voluptuous and need to hear a handsome man raving about luscious curves.  :^) <br />If you liked \\"Suddenly You\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Bride and the Beast\\", \\"The Accidental Bride\\", or \\"The Fire-Flower\\".re wonderful; very sensual, but tastefully done rather than becoming all-out erotica.
