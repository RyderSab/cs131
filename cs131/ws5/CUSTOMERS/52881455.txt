Presumably, this book was written in part for people like us: hearing parents of deaf toddlers, struggling to know what is best for our child, and what his or her world will be like. From that point of view, Bertling did provide us with some perspectives not available elsewhere, and I am  glad I read (both) of his books. At the same time, I have serious  misgivings about this book. For example, I wanted hard data: names, dates,  places. Berlting provides almost none, making me heavily dependent on HIS  assesment of what he says things were like. He might or might not be  accurate in his narration; I have no way of knowing. Bertling also seems  generally unaware that many of things he criticizes in Deaf culture occur  in other cultures as well. For example, he critcizes the student strike at  Gallaudet in 1988 as being orchestrated by outsiders; but student unrest  all over the world is often aggravated by outside forces. My question is,  how is this relevant to DEAF culture? If his point is that Deaf culture is  no more immune to such manipulation than are other cultures, fine, he  convinced me; but if his point is that such manipulation is the FRUIT of  Deaf culture (and I rather think that IS his point), then I have to sorry,  not convinced. The first two chapters of &quot;No Dignity&quot; are  especially inflammatory ( a criticism I do not make of the rest of the  work). The problems of deaf residential schools are (or were) real, and  little Joshua was additionally brutalized by an extremely sick person. Who  could disagree that this was horrible? But, is this where we should start  the analysis? If proponents of a given educational regime are rightly  criticized for only trotting out their success stories, should not  opponents of a given regime be criticized for only parading the worst case  scenarios? Bertling's second book, this, although quite short, is still  better written than was his first (or perhaps it was just better edited).  To the degree that Bertling has provided a reality check to fanatics in any  cultural group, I think his book has served a useful purpose. Moreover, so  many people in the Deaf world still quite new to us seem to have read it,  that it merits a reading, if only to keep up on the discussion. But I don't  recommend this book be placed early on one's deafness reading list, and  when one does sit down to read it, I recommment that it be read with a very  sharp eye to detail.	2000-04-27

I came to this book as an outsider who needed to learn as much as possible about deaf issues in general and about deaf education in particular. This book was on nearly everybody's list, but for widely varying reasons.  Written by a deaf man and a product of deaf residential schools,  &quot;Child Sacrificed&quot; is Bertling's scathing indictment of Deaf  cultural in general (or at least most aspects of it) and of deaf  residential schools in particular. Since Bertling provides, however, almost  no specific identifying information, it is basically impossible for me at  least to know how accurate his recollections are. Even assuming they are  accurate enough, such stories are hardly helpful to me in assessing what  things are like in my day, or in my area, or for my deaf child, etc.  Several problems will dog the reader, such as the brevity of the work given  its purported scope, and the persistent annoyance of grammatical errors.  But of most concern to me was Bertling's seeming unawareness that many of  the kinds of problems he described in deaf education are not necessarily  unique to deaf education. To me it seems obvious that Bertling was  misplaced in a residential school in the first place and mistreated once he  got there. But is every mistake in Betling's life the fault of &quot;Deaf  Culture&quot;? As an outsider, I cannot say. But as an intelligent reader,  I have the right to expect more in the way of demonstration of Bertling's  many assertions before assenting to them. I am glad I read both of  Bertling's books. I feel I learned something from them. But I must say to  unitiated readers, read it with your eyes wide open, and your thinking cap  firmly in place.	2000-04-27

Second only to Paul Ogden's &quot;Silent Garden&quot; (which treats of a broader range of issues than does &quot;Choices&quot;) this is the most balanced and readable book specifically dealing with deaf education and  communications options that we (hearing parents of profoundly deaf toddler)  have yet found. There is a very good mix of professional articles and  actual parental stories, recently supplemented by updates from the children  themselves, now mostly grown. This is the only book of its kind that we  have seen that provides actual audiograms for most stundets/subjects,  something hearing parents MUST have in order to relate the stories in  &quot;Choices&quot; to THEIR kids' situation. (I only wish AIDED audiograms  had been consistently included as well, since those are nearly as important  as basic audiograms.)  I dont suggest tinkering with success, but I do  think somewhat more information on the failure rates for given options  should have been given, since it is far too easy for us as parents to  imagine OUR child as being the succesful student portrayed in each section,  thus short-chaging the down-side risks of each option. Also, it might have  been nice if a few more stories of deaf people who DIDNT live in Maryland  at some point in their life could have been included. That's hardly a real  criticsm, though, and I conclude by this book highly.	2000-04-26

Over 90% of deaf children in the US have hearing parents, and perhaps the first thing those parents learn is that the single word &quot;deaf&quot; is unable to convey the wide range of hearing losses lumped under the term  &quot;deaf&quot;, and with that, the consequently wide range of options  that Deaf people have for dealing with life. Since each Deaf story is so  uniquie, though, it is all the more wonderful that the Spradley family was  able to tell the highly individualistic story of their deaf daughter Lynn  (now a young adult) in such way that it holds the interest of, and teaches  valuable lessons to, the families of other deaf chidlren, regardless of  their particular situation. Curious how one family can learn things about  itself while reading the story of another family, but that's what happened  with us. This more &quot;humane&quot; book is also welcome break from the  reams of more techical reading that most hearing parents must plow through  as part of helping their deaf children. I recommend this book warmly.	2000-04-26

James Akin has brought order out of the  confusion that marks so much of  Catholic worship these days.

As modern secular scholars continue to discover the untapped riches preserved in the texts and treatises of medieval canon law, most of them immediately confront the problem of working in Latin, especially juridic Latin.

Gilchrist's introduction and indexes along with the generally handsome production values make this the kind of work which one can simply sit down and enjoy, even if one approaches it with only the vaguest familiarity with the topics. In brief, a fascinating look into the life and values of Europe and the Church as both first emerged from several centuries of turmoil following the collapse of Rome.	1997-12-19

Antonin Scalia is blessed with a powerful intellect and a persuasive manner of expression.

Proponents of judicial activism (and Scalia graciously shares space with two of the most famous, Tribe &amp; Dworkin) will be hard-pressed to keep up the pretense that federal courts today are much more than arenas for elite social engineers to rework society in their own image and likeness. A fine study in modern legal philosophy, I recommend this work with few reservations.

A strong case can be made that Englishman John Henry (Cardinal) Newman reinvented the religious univeristy in the 19th century and that most such universities, regardless of their denomination, functioned quite well until the computer age. Now, with all universities being forced to rethink their own identity and mission, the values which Newman enuntiated for them over 100 years ago will return to guide their reinvention in our own day. Or, they can return, if they are given the chance. Yale University is to be commended for putting Newman's ideas on the university back on the table in such a splendid format. Every aspect of this work deserves praise, from the editor's introduction and special footnotes, to the analytical essays which merit a careful reading in their own right.

Beautifully printed proceedings of one of the largest canon law conventions ever held, with over 50 addresses in five languages covering more than 1,000 pages. A real who's-who of international canon law experts. The strength and weakness of this work is its time of presentation, ie., concurrent with the revised Code of Canon Law. That was a time of marked uncertainty in Catholic Church law, and several of the papers reflect this. For all that, a highly regarded work of lasting value.	1997-12-08

This book first appeared as a hardback in 1985, just after the 1983 Code of Canon Law was released. The paperback &quot;study edition&quot;, virtually identical to the hardback, came out later. In either form, this book is the standard American commentary on the revised code. It generally shows a high degree of scholarship and canonical insight. Written by a variety of commentators, however, the quality of writing is uneven, and some sections are open to criticism. One should not assume that opinions presented in this (or any other) commentary are official opinions, or even widely accepted. A substantially revised version is currently underway and can be expected around the end of 1998. Even so, this earlier version of the work will remain a valuable resource for practicing canon lawyers and others interested in Catholic Church law and practice. In particular, given that most of the commentary was actually written toward the end of the canonical reform period (which ran roughly from 1965-1983) the commentary herein tends to reflect accurately this period of uncertainity and speculation which affected all aspects of Church law following the Second Vatican Council. I use the book daily in my canonical practice and often recommended it to careful readers. The index is excellent. There is, alas, no Latin original text provided.	1997-12-08

This is the standard American translation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law. There are a few translations in it which have received criticism, but because the Latin original text is provided on facing pages (a benefit which distinguishes the American translation from the British), these flaws are not serious. There are no footnotes in this edition of the code, and no commentary on the canons. The index of terms is hardly sufficient. Still, the advantages of the book (for example, its portablity) make it very useful for Americans, second only to a major comentary on the canons.	1997-12-08

This slim book provides a one-stop reference for those researching the work of (mostly) American canon lawyers between the end of Vatican II (1965) to just before the publication of the 1983 Code of Canon Law. The annotations are somewhat uneven in quality, but remain generally useful.	1997-12-08

This is a translation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law produced by the Canon Law Society of Great Britian and Ireland. It covers the entire revised Code and a few supporting documents. The translation is reliable and graceful, but is not widely cited in the United States. There is no commentary on the canons, and an index of canons must be purchased separately. The original Latin text of the canons is not provided. Overall, a respectable, but strictly utilitarian, production.	1997-12-05

I remember, more than 20 years after the fact, reading this book cover to cover while in college, and realizing for the first time that the whole thing made deep sense.

A detailed and extensive, but still quite readable, commentary on all 1,752 canons of the 1983 Code of Canon Law. Already highly-regarded by practicing canon lawyers, this book is finding an increasing audience among laity who appreciate its accessible language and obvious commitment to accuracy. Written some ten years after the new Code went into effect, this book benefits by having allowed some post-Vatican II dust to settle and by being able to watch how some of the newer canons were going to be applied in actual Church life. I consider this work one of staples of canonical practice, and I use it on a nearly daily basis.	1997-12-05

That said, this small book is probably the best index of canonical topics available in English. It's quite easy to use. Note: those who get the major British commentary, &quot;The Canon Law: Letter &amp; Spirit&quot; (avail. 1996), will no longer need this separate index volume.	1997-12-05

As a professional canon lawyer with a long-standing mistrust of anything marked &quot;Kennedy&quot;, I wanted to like this book.
