I wish I read The Pride of Lions before I picked this up from the library for a more complete experience but nevertheless, I enjoyed the book thoroughly; the story and characters will linger in my head for many days to come.<br />This is a very well-written historical romance.  Technically, her description is vivid; so many ways to describe the changing colours of the sky, landscape and weather.  Historically, this book is rich in history; its accuracy amplifies the tragedy and emotional roller-coaster ride of the characters.  Romantically, the love between Catherine and Alex, Deidre and Aluinn, are heart-wrenching.  It contains separation, reunion, steamy love-making and courageous determination.  Creatively, the plot twists are spellbinding and masterful; giving some examples would spoil the fun.<br />Words are not enough to praise this book.  I was simply transferred into another world.  This is a long story, not easy to read in some parts but at the end of it I feel thankful for the experience and sorry that it has ended.  That's what a good book is about.	2004-07-19

There is a lot of chemistry between them that you could feel the charged atmostphere when both of them are in the scene.  The plot is reasonably convincing to support the romance (this is a romance novel first of all).  Judge Roberts is such a dear that I am sorry he has to die in the story.  I like that the author allows Sarah and Cahill to date a bit before falling into bed, well, not really a bed but an exercise mat.  Their first sex scene is hot!  The part of how the murderer keeps Sarah captive is a little chilling but a great built-up to the climax.  We only hear about the family of Sarah and Cahill indirectly, I would prefer that some of them actually appear on scene.  Overall, an enjoyable, above-average romance from LH.	2004-06-29

The author come across as being sincere and objective in his writing and reporting.  He often tries to report views of opposite sides, that helps the readers to make sense of the situation and make their own judgement.  Even in his grimiest account of the oppressive tradition, the author respects the Indian heritage instead of outright condemnation from a westerner's point of view.  I enjoy reading the historic background of the many issues discussed.  As the essays are written over a period of time, the author is able to track the development of the subject.  This helps to present more than just a snapshot of the subject; the outcome of the subject often provide thought-provoking insight and perspective to the matter.  The diversity of the issues in various political, cultural and social-geographical background reminds that the Indian sub-continent is mulitifaceted, one should keep an open mind and not quick to form one's perception of South Asia.	2004-05-14

I have mixed feelings about this book.  It is a good travelogue.  Terzani paints vivid accounts of his encounters, what he sees, smells, feels and thinks.  I enjoy the historic background he included about the places he visits.  Terzani also provides some thought provoking insights about his view on history, humanity, economic and political development.  He has interesting and rare interviews with a few people, including the drug lord Khun Sa.  However, the credibility of this book suffers from his apparent condescension, selective belief and prejudice.  For example, Terzani is openly critical of the desire and diligence of the Chinese to improve their life.  He scorns globalisation and everything modern.  He romantises living in a hot, humid, dirty and basic condition and criticises aspirations for more comfort.  Granted that some ignorance of the Asian rulers have made the process of modernisation somewhat intrusive and destructive to their heritage and environment.  A civilisation takes time to evolve and learn from mistakes.  But Terzani fails to see the need or consequences if nothing is done instead.  In his view, backwardness and poverty appear more deserving of celebration than success stories.  He lacks objectivity and he chooses to believe more in the romantic versions and the underdogs.  Some of his ideas are simply ridiculous and extreme.  He proposes to isolate Cambodia from any external help and influences so as to let the country 'heals' on her own.  Granted that globalisation is an enormous homogenising factor, but perhaps one should look closer at how to harness the good and minimise the bad instead of writing it off.  Because of Terzani's long working and living experience in Asia that his words are believed to be credible and accurate, the more important it is to expose his selective information and prejudiced judgement.	2004-04-29

The plot differs from The Duke and I and The Viscount Who Loves Me, which makes it very refreshing, less predictable, yet still so charming and romantic.  I can't help to sympathise with Philip, about being lock in the responsibility of a title he doesn't want, being lock in a loveless and passionless marriage, being feeling trapped of how to be a good father to his children.  He is also so honourable and kind.  Yet he certainly has a devilish charm too, especially how he shows Eloise why they are suited for each other - by pleasuring her on impulse!  JQ did it again with her trademark witty dialogue and clever plot twists.  I simply adore the bickerings of the Bridgerton brothers!  Finally, the ending of how Philip expresses his love to Eloise is sooooooooo romantic!	2004-04-27

I enjoy Keeper of the Heart most.  I love the determination of Falon to pursue Shanelle and make her his, his tenderness and his good measure of reasonableness as compared to Challen and Dalden.  Shanelle is kind-hearted but with a temper (not excessively).  I like this book better also as it has much follow-up of Challen and Tedra.  The verbal battle between Martha and Brock is amusing too.  It does not have excessive explanation of the background and history unlike the first and the last book.  Readers who have read the first book could follow it easily and should love it too.  Heart of the Warrior is the most disappointing of the lot.  The possesiveness and protectiveness of the warriors are quite endearing.  I enjoy reading how Falon tried to make up for his initial lack of sensibility, with a blend of determination and self-control, to gain Shanelle's trust.  I like Falon character to be capable of jeolousy and frustration, he is the most expressive of the 3 warriors, and I think the most likeable.	2004-04-23

The first part when Marcus wanted to take care of Duchess and second half when they were at Chase Park was more engaging.  As expected, Marcus was quite a jerk until Duchess was hurt, the more serious her injuries, it flashed out more feelings he had for her.  As for Duchess, she was quite annoyingly frigid in her responses, not enough initiatives to say what was on her mind until being thoroughly enraged by Marcus.  Still, it was had for the reader to understand when they started to feel for each other.  Marcus seemed not to care much about Duchess' feelings by continuing to see his mistress, by saying all the hurtful things and using her body to satisfy his lust and then scorned her after.  But it must be frustrating to deal with Duchess too; she built a wall around herself.  There were some romantic moments towards the end, but it felt kind of too late in a way.  Furthermore, the peppering of political characters during that time throughout the story could be confusing and distracting to the story.  The ending felt like an anti-climax too, who cares about the outcome of Maggie's romance, which was barely mentioned earlier anyway.  Also, I found it a bit stretched for Trevor to smuggle two unconscious human beings out of the mansion without rousing anyone.	2004-04-05

There are parts of good writing by the author but the story is unnecessarily draggy and depressing.  Alice always just look at the negative side of things, bemoaning her life and that people around her has robbed her of something.  For example, she would notice how ugly a person is than anything else.  I find her attitude to Nellie particularly selfish and rude.  Her daughters are supposed to be difficult to handle, yet Nellie has helped her while she drowns herself in self-pity.  I just feel that I have better way to spend my time than to read and feel annoyed and depressed about Alice's life.	2004-03-09

I wonder if this is a romance novel or a fantasy narration.  Brittany and Dalden barely interact enough to fall in love.  In fact, there are more ink of Brittany interacting with the computer Martha than with Dalden.  There is virtually no sex scene, which makes this book unbearingly dull.  Brittany is not an impressive lead character, rather stupid and stubborn.  How could she keep convincing herself that she is in some fantasy programme?!

The first part before Tedra appeared before Challen was a little confusing and far-fetched.  But the moment the 2 characters met, the sparks and chemistry were keeping the reader well-entertained.  It was very sensual.  The barbaric rules of Challen's world provided many erotic scenarios for sex scenes, sexual stimulation and sexual punishment.  Very tantalising but reasonable from the Challen's point of view in an imagined world.  From teasing her sensually while Tedra was hand bounded to the lovemaking to make up for his guilt, Challen was powerful, domineering and tender in his own exciting ways.  I like the part when Challen tried to correct his mistake by being as reasonable and tender to Tedra.  It is always heart-melting to watch a strong man moved by strong emotions by loving his woman.  I enjoyed the verbal sparring between Tedra and her computer Martha, as well as those exchanges between her and Challen.  But the rescuing of Tedra's planet part was rather sloppy.  It is forgivable since the main plot was the romance.  The time, space and foreign elements were just to stretched the emotional threshold of the characters.	2004-02-19

It suffered the same sequel syndrome, telling a similar plot with different characters.  In the first book, Harry's father died of cancer.  In this book, his mother had breast cancer but survived.  In the first book, Harry had a one-night stand that triggered his divorce.  In this book, Harry was close to have an affair, in fact, it was as good as having an affair minus sex, and his second marriage was on the verge of collapse.  In the first book, Harry got jealous with Gina's new boyfriend and subsequently her husband.  In this book, Harry got jealous with Cyd's business partner.<br />If I had not read the first book, this book might be interesting.  However, having read the first book, this sequel looked too suspiciously similar thus lost the originality.  I was quite put off with the flip-flopping of Harry with his life.  He was always on the verge of making the same mistake again.  In the end, Harry exhausted our sympathy and became a jerk in our eyes.  He appeared to be a whim, unlike Kazumi who took the break-off with such dignity, unlike Cyd who tried to build something of her own.  These 2 ladies had the courage to look forward but Harry was always looking at the past, always so insecure.  In the end, I felt that it would be just a matter of time before history repeated itself in Harry's life.<br />This sequel could be more promising if the author tried to have new angle for plot twists, instead of copying the old formula.  I like the first book much more.	2004-02-16

The author includes good and well-researched background and history of some of the places and sites.  Her account of her interaction with the people she met is particularly fascinating.  However, I find some of her stubbornness and naiveness about travelling in Burma a little hard to swallow.  For example, the way she argued when she tried to get air tickets, withdraw money using visa etc.  Things just don't always work or turn out the way we expect it to be.  We just have to take it in our stride.  I am also a bit annoyed when the author seemed to long for the more colourful and less developed lifestyle of the people she had observed in her previous visit.  People living in these less developed countries also deserve progress and modernisation, even if their government mismanaged the process.  They still have a lot to learn about how not to be short-sighted to destroy heritage and culture while modernising, we cannot judge them using the standard and priority we are used to in the developed countries.  These people don't deserve to live in a primitive way just to satisfy our quest to see something exotic and un-spoilt.	2003-12-31

The first part of the book narrated the accident and flashback of the loving time between Leigh Kendall and Logan Manning.  The flashback broke the story momentum and suspense.  It make the search for Logan appeared longer and more draggy than it should be.  The flashback also made the reader skeptical of how loving the couple really were.  It came across that JM was trying hard to persuade the readers to believe in something which she would shatter later.<br />When Michael Valente, Samatha Littleton and Mack entered the scene, then the story started to look more exciting.  That also meant that Leigh Kendall was such an uninspiring character to hold much of the readers' interest in the first part of the book.  I was much more hooked on the chemistry and attraction between Sam and Mack than between Michael and Leigh.  Unfortunately, JM did not spare much ink on Sam and Mack.  Sam and Mack had the more interesting and clever dialogue too.  I found Leigh's falling in love with Michael too unconvincing and abrupt, though Michael's devotion towards Leigh was touching and endearing.  And for a romance novel, the (very) few love scenes were very anti-climax.  The love scene between Sam and Mack could have so much more potential, more explosive than the effort JM put in.<br />In addition, there were plenty of loopholes in the book.  The final revelation about Logan, the murderer and Logan's source of unexplained income were presented very sloppily - all dumped at us at once without much logic and explanation.  It left the readers with more questions than answers.  In short, this is a readable novel with some interesting characters and pockets of good moments, but fall short of a good novel, especially of one by JM.	2003-12-23

Ni Ni's short life was a snapshot of the helplessness, courage and tragedy of the Burmese people under the rule of a brutal, corrupt and repressive regime.  The search of an old basket weaved the stories and observations very nicely together.  It was quietly powerful, a non-provocative, dignified and compassionate account of Burma.  Throughout the book, I felt anger, sadness, admiration and humbleness.  I was charmed by the generosity, friendliness, sincerity, warmth, hospitality, honesty, dignity and courage of the people.  I wish the tourists and merchants could show more consideration and respect to Burmese people, culture, resources, environment and heritage.  We would be no better than the foreigner who used Ni Ni and discarded her after use, who took without caring what he took away.  The nation deserves better and this book helps us to understand its plight and hope.	2003-11-29

She did not seem to know what she wanted, just floating around and behaving irrationally with scant care about hurting people who loved her.  Whenever she felt guilty and confused, all she could muttered was &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;  I got so fed up with her apologies, which were the only line the author could thought of at every critical juncture and offered nothing else.  It also means that the readers became no wiser of what was ticking Carrie, except writing her off as a confused and unreliable drifter in life.  I was especially irritated when Carrie put off going back to Madison, and later New York, with the excuse that she was not ready.  It was as if the rest of the people who cared about her did not matter a bit while she was procrastinating, as if the the world stood still while she was making up her mind.  Her offhanded treatment of her relationships was almost curt and cruel.  Habitually, she just let things drifted, until someone couldn't stand it anymore and make an ultimatum or simply cut off relationship with her.  Either that, or she made a 180 degree turn to reverse her decision at the last minute.  The author should try harder to provide a more palatable plot twists.<BR> <BR>Kilroy had the potential to be an interesting character, a source to enlighten and sort out the confusion of Carrie's choices and how to live.

Somehow the men in Julia Quinn's stories were all foolishly refusing love, thus all the pain and anguish, until something snapped to shake some sense to them.  It was still a charming read.  However, I wish the plot twists could offer more surprises.  Both books had similar plots: the men who refused to love, the sensible ladies, the forced marriage as a result of compromising situation, the anguish-filled escape, the near-death panic, the confession and forgiveness, and finally, happily ever after.

Hmmmmm, looks like many people have strong words about this book, mainly disgust and repulsion of lack of moral and resonableness of the plot.  The story was a little forced and sort of assumed we would not have a sense of logic to spot the far-fetched plot of the story.  Dimitri's behaviour was certainly outrageous, no matter how permissive his lifestyle.  Sexual satisfaction or rather, unsatiable sexual need, was the first and most important attraction.  But then, we read romance novels for romantic and sexual fantasy.  Katherine first had sex with Dimitri because she was drugged and dying with need.  Well, it was not morally right. (...)  At least Katherine abstained from Dimitri since then till she was drugged again, and Dimitri did not force her, so I gave some credit for their moral and character.  But Katherine did not seem as intelligent as she was made out to be, kind of naive in some ways though I found her stubborness quite entertaining to read about.  A complaint would be that the ending appeared to be hastily written.  To those who complain loudly about the logic and moral loopholes of this book, well, just take the story as a pinch of salt, we read such novels for fantasy, no point killing our brain cells to agonise the sense and sensibility of it.	2003-10-29

There was too much name-dropping, one has to be very familiar with the power scene of Washington at her time to really appreciate who was who and their significance.  That itself made the book very unapproachable to readers who do not move in her circle, non-American, the younger generation etc.  A lot of time she just mentioned the names and expected the readers to know who they were or connect to her earlier mentions (it would really be a pain to constantly check the index and refer back to the earlier pages!)<br />This book read like an account of achievement of her father, her husband and herself.  Honestly, Katharine came across as someone fairly stupid (though kind), I couldn't help to wonder if she was who she was simply because of her birth, marriage and being there at the right time.

Before that I heard and read that he is one of the greatest travel writers in modern times.  Granted, this guy wrote well, but his attitude was insufferable.  At the end of it, I wonder is this a traveller writing a book on travel or a writer writing a book on travel.<br />This book is almost exclusively about a train journey.  PT tried to take train throughout the journey for the sake of it, even though everyone told him that bus was faster etc.  But of course he was going to take the train so we read about him whining about its poor condition, its delay, how pathetic the people travelling on the train, how godforsaken the towns were etc.<br />PT had this high and mighty attitude that he scorned about comments by the common tourists (a lower and more superficial class of people on the road whom he was not associating himself with); he had condescending opinion on people reading main-stream books, books which he considered less literarily acclaimed than his own selection on the trip.  Oh yes, you get to read about what he read on the trip, with some thoughts and paragraphs included.<br />Being strictly a journey book, PT travelled from point A to point B, with lots of observations and comments on the way, but don't expect him to write a bit about some of the sights he saw along the way (not even Machu Picchu) or some snippets of the history, culture and politics of the places he passed through.  He did not even demonstrate a sense of humour!  Worse, he was a first-class hypocrite, saying things he thought what the person would prefer to hear instead of his own unkind opinion.<br />PT wrote a very vivid account, a very detailed description on colours, sounds and scents of his journey.

I found myself impatient to know the story after the crash, how the fate of Valerie, Nick and Sybille would met again.<br />Valerie was beautiful, rich and intelligent.  She had no goals in live other than travelling to places she had not been, flying all over the world to attend parties, indulging in pleasures in life.  She got bored and restless easily but generally she was kind and had a great human touch.  It was easy to be jealous with someone like Valerie, who appeared to have everything without any effort.  So Sybille was extremely jealous of Valerie.  Sybille grew up with Valerie and strived to outdo everything about Valerie, going to the same school, getting the same men, gaining the same wealth and living in the same estate.  Nick was Valerie's boyfriend till his proposal frightened Valerie away and Sybille found her ways to marry him.  Thankfully, Nick finally waked up and divorced Sybille.<br />The story fascinated me right from the beginning and the plot was pretty good.  It had very good character development, which often reflected how people around us probably reacted or felt the some way in different degree.  For example, Sybille never really lived life at present but waiting for her life to begin after a future milestone, like after she left college, after she got a job at a TV station, after she moved to New York City, after her marriage, after her husband's death, after moving to the exclusive estate etc.  She was often resenting her present life.  She was unable to love and always lonely and angry.  Don't we often find ourselves wishing that something is over or something would happen so that our life would really begin?  Too often people spend the best time of their life waiting for the best time of their life.  The story also told Valerie's and Nick's fair share of weaknesses and how they overcame it.<br />All in all, an engaging read.	2003-06-19

It is fine to try to have a romance set in Cuba or telling the story of life in Cuba through a love story but in the end, it felt neither here nor there.  I have not been to Cuba and so I can't comment on the authencity of the author's description of the country.  As for the love story, I was not entirely sure what Richard and Lourdes saw in each other to fall in love.  Their so-called love felt a little superficial and unconvincing.  Richard always seemed impatient to have sex with Lourdes.  He just appeared to me as someone not sure about what he wants and afraid to confront what he wants.  In comparison, Lourdes was pretty single-minded about what she wanted.  The ending was up to anybody's interpretation, was it a sad story or not?  Maybe the tragedy was about Lourdes' hope that love could overcome any obstacles and Richard's skepticism about love and trust, just disillusion and regret in the end.	2003-05-22
US	51872419	R3AXPBM2YRKTLH	0446300578	402906162	Loving Julia	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Fiery and intense	Julia/Jewel had a fighting spirit, she was fiery, determined, brave, kind, smart, funny and forgiving, all the traits of an endearing heroine, she was indeed.  She spiced up every scene with her presence.  Sebastian was cold and cynical, but hidden behind the icy mask was a man hungry for love and afraid to be hurt by loving anyone.  Despite the harsh and unforgiving condition of living on the street, Jewel cherished herself, was brave, kind and compassionate.  Despite having everything he could possibly have in life, Sebastian was lonely and deprived of love.<br />I enjoyed reading how Jewel struggled to be Julia, a lady, how she refused to be defeated, how shame and pride made her determined and brave.  It provided the most funny and admirable moments and I found myself applauding her spirit and triumphs.  There were sparks whenever Sebastian and Julia were together, the fiery exchanges, the battling of wits, control and passion.  Sometime I found Sebastian to be too harsh and cruel to Julia, in turn being harsh to himself.  The book had very good character development, but I wish for a little more insights to the anguish felt by Sebastian when he forced himself to hurt the person he loved.  Sebastian was almost too cold and unfeeling at some scenes to be likeable at all.  Despite all the ill treatment from Sebastian, Julia was determined to fight for her love, to break his icy control and reach behind his mask.  She was touchingly forgiving and loved so completely.  So I was particularly satisfied to read about Sebastian's anguish when he feared that he might lose Julia forever.  That certainly brought up the depth of his feelings toward Julia, his desperate need to have someone who love him totally, and hardened his resolve to treasured her for the rest of his life.  Though I think Sebastian deserved to suffer a bit for the way he treated Julia earlier, there is something very tender about a man losing control over love.<br />Well, I won't say that the book wasromantic.  But it tugged your heart and carried you along with the tide of emotions of the characters.  The plot held enough twists and surprisings that you would hold your breath and keep the pages turning.  Quite a wonderful read.	2003-01-16

The way the list captured the attention of the media was too far-fetched, as if there was really nothing spicy enough for the media to go crazy at all.  The chemistry between Jaine and Sam was great though, always fiery and surprising.  I wish there were more pages allocatd to them, they only sort of got to know each other towards the middle of the book.  After building up such an intense chemistry between them, the sex scenes were a bit disappointing.  Sam appeared to be turned on by the spirit of Jaine but Jaine appeared to be more fascinated with the physical beauty of Sam's body.  So the romance was a little superficial to my liking.	2003-01-13

The author kept highlighting how incredibly beautiful and sexy Ronnie was that all men were drawn to her like bees to honey.  However, beyond the surface, she was selfish, vain, snobbish, materialistic and displayed a questionable level of intelligence and common sense.  There was little character development of how she attracted Tom, except through dressing up sexily and flirting shamelessly.  All I could see was that Ronnie was irresistible to the organ on the lower part of Tom's body.  She found herself pitiful that there was no love in her marriage, that her husband was sleeping around from the first day of their marriage.  Come on!  Ronnie did not marry the Senator for love in the first place!  She tried to believe that her husband loved her so that it would be less unpalatable to marry him for money.  So there was nothing to lament about, she got what she wanted.  But Ronnie wanted more from the bargain, she wanted good sex and love but still wanted to enjoy the glamorous lifestyle and money of being the Senator's wife.  I really despised her so much that I didn't think she deserved to get what she had in the end.<br />Tom had the potential to be a real intelligent, magnetic and sexy character.  But the author failed to demonstrate how good he was as a political consultant, worse, he appeared to just fall for Ronnie for her looks and body, not to mention his double standard with his wife's adultery and his partner's fling.<br />All the unmoral and irresponsible actions were almost justified because the characters fell in love with each other.  I failed to see love between them other than lust.  All I could say that perhaps they really deserved each other, very superficially.  For a relationship which lust formed the basis, the sex scenes were unimaginative and stale.  If the author decided to write a trashy book, at least make it hot and erotic.<br />The plot was very amateurish, especially coming from Karen Robards.  The sub plot of the murder on board the ship was distracting and converged with the main story too late and too weakly.  I always love her books but this one was too disappointing.  My advice is: give this book a miss.	2003-01-06

There was not much character and romance development.

The steamy sex scenes were typical of Susan Johnson's style, but I was hoping that they were less predictable.  Venus supposed to have a mind of her own, except when it came to her sexual desires.  Often, she would tell herself that she should not do this or that but still succumbed to the sexual temptation.  The author only touched on briefly about her intelligence and knowledge.  I would prefer more coverage on what Venus and Jack talked about when they were not having sex.  The author wanted to convince us that both of them intrigued and attacted each other as equals but there was little character development in that arena.  The storyline was rather straightforward and predictable, definitely not her best but readable.	2002-12-02

Elisabeth found herself in the same house one hundred years back when she worn the magical necklance.  I was intrigued by the kind of shock and bewilderment that I imagined that I would experience, just like Elisabeth.  Furthermore, she met and fell in love with Jonanthan and his daughter, Trista.  Jonanthan was a loving and devoted father to Trista, despite his hectic life as the physician of the town.  But we felt his loneliness and sadness.  He was a man in need of a woman's love.  And Trista, adorable and yet at times appeared to be too mature for her age, yielded and deserved a mother.  Elisabeth just fit the role perfectly, except that she was from the time a century away.  I was touched by the extent of commitment one would need to overcome to realise the dream of being with the loved ones, separated by a century.  At the end, I wished there was more.  It would be better if there was greater room for character development.	2002-11-26

It has good character development and a romantic story line.  Amanda was spirited, yet lovely and sweet.  She literally saved the life of Matt.  Matt was overwhelmed, almost could not believe that Amanda could be such an angel.  But he did not want to love, because he was scared of being hurt when he loved another woman again.  When he found out that he was in love with Amanda, he tried to rein his heart and clinged on a misunderstanding to keep him from falling head over heel with Amanda.  Amanda was much more courageous in love, even making the painful decision to leave Matt, because she thought Matt did not love her and it would be a torture to be with him.  The climax of such romance was when the hard hero finally came to term with his intense feelings which made those words many times more touching.  A story with a happy ending, leaving a sweet smile on your face when you close the book.	2002-11-22

Jared first saw Cassie on a moonlit beach and thought she was a native since she dressed like them, just a sarong aroung her waist, leaving her tantalising breasts bared.  That was a sure innocent way to arouse a man.  But Cassie was not out to seduce, she was brought up at the island and thus not self-conscious about her body.  Like most Iris Johansen heroines, Cassie unknowingly needed to be needed.  She was very protective over Kapu, her beloved horse.  Thank goodness it was not another child or dependent person.  I liked reading about her resistance to stay in Jared's bed.  Cassie wanted their lovemaking to be just mating, so as not to be vulnerable to betray her father.  The sexual tension between Jared and Cassie was very strong, which added to the joy of reading the story.  I enjoyed reading about how Cassie taunted Jared's command, in her small way but was extremely frustrating for Jared.  The secondary characters did not have a cunning sense of humour as in her other books.  Brandford was supposed to be but he was a tad bland.  Josephine injected some energy into the story but had a relatively minor role in the story development.	2002-11-22

It intrigued me to read on and find out what happened.  Then Jill got increasingly paranoid and neurotic.  She kept behaving in ways that she soon hated herself for, which was annoying to read.  Alex was mysterious, why he fell in love with Jill was mysterious too.  The problem with the story was that there were not enough reasons for readers to understand why Jill and Alex cared about each other.<br />It was the sub-plot that shone.  The story between Kate and Edward was moving.  In fact, Kate was the most vivid and haunting character in the entire story.  She got most of the best lines too.  I wish the author could devote the same talent to the character development of Jill, Alex and Edward.  Kate was so heartwrenchingly steadfast in love and friendship, yet her death was so tragic and haunting.  The image of how she suffered fear, hunger, cold, helplessness, hopelessness, pain and yet still keeping her faith of love and friendship was too moving and haunting.  After the fierce quest of Jill to find justice for Kate, I found it hard to accept that there was not.<br />There were many flaws in the story.  It did not make sense that Kate sent her son away because she felt something might happen to her and yet left no trace about who she was meeting.<br />I finished the book without feeling satisfied.  I could not get enough of the tale between Edward and Kate, Edward and Anne.  I wished I could read more about Edward in the years after Kate.  Somehow, the relationship between Jill and Alex was not important at all.	2002-11-16

It felt a little too narrative and superficial sometime.  One aspect I find lacking is the expression of his feelings and character.  We know that David is not perfect, he admitted to be very demanding and could be rather explosive in temperament.  But we do not get much insight on that but have to read between the lines to find out.<br />Strangely, he talked much about his father, who appeared to be just an unpleasant distant memory, someone he had little feelings, yet he hardly mentioned his mother and how close was their relationship.  He said that he had a great time with Veronique when working side by side with each other and he worked her very hard, but no details to illustrate.  His marriage failure told much about a man whose passion for the mountains was much greater than his love for his wife.  There is no right or wrong, everyone makes choices and bears the responsibility of such choices.<br />This book is about how a man became what and who he is now.  It has much details on how he climbed higher each time and how his skills evolved to be who he is today.  But if you want to see the man beyond his achievement, you only get some clues, which only whet your appetite for curiosity.  Maybe that's the angle of the book, to focus on how and what he achieved, than on anything too personal.	2002-11-06
US	51872419	R2NCNVSYC0M5M7	0553578650	335189681	A Touch of Sin	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Steamy read but go easy on the story	Honestly, the circumstances of how Pasha and Trixi met each other made me cringed and braced myself for a trashy bimbo story.  In fact, those steamy scenes are what one look forward to read about in her books.  In that aspect, the book did not disappoint.<br />Trixi was quick to succumb to the charm of Pasha and lust of her own, so quick that all claims of her naivety sounded quite hypocritical.  Then followed by the sex scenes in the coach on the way from Paris to Calais.  There was something naughty and wanton about.  Sex is very much on the mind of both characters, until Pasha felt compelled to go off and fight a war in Greece.<br />Really, I found it not very convincing for Pasha to fight a war just to help his friends.  He was not a soldier like his dad and he was supposed to be the manager of their family wealth and enterprises.   That conveniently set the scene for Trixi to be pursued by her enemy and travelled all the way to Greece to see Pasha, Of course, that set the scene for her to be captured, sexually toyed  by her captor and then rescued by Pasha.  This erotic scene at the Turk's tent mirrored that of 'Love Storm', though disappointingly brief and tame in comparison.<br />Overall, the sex scenes were exciting enough but not refreshingly imaginative.  The story had a flimsy plot and the characters lack depth.  So be clear of what you want out of the book to avoid disappointment.	2002-10-29

There is something very tender about a man holding back, wishing the best for the woman he loves and finally any restraint is just too much for the intense feelings.<br />John unhurriedly proceeded to make Niema aware of him but still exercised extreme control of himself.  So when he was touched to the extent to express his feelings for her, it became so intense and powerful that just took my breath away: when he allowed himself to look at her with all the love in his eyes, when he impulsively wished to kiss her when she sweetly felt sorry about him needing to kill his wife, when he eventually told her of his pent-up love for her, and the need to abstain from seeing her at the hospital.  All these just touched something in you and contrasted much with the man the author tried to portray as in total control of himself with punishing discipline.<br />The story is more of a romance set in a thriller setting than a thriller with a romantic twist.  But I'm not complaining about it, in fact, rather pleasantly surprised by it.	2002-10-28

Everest Disaster	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Haunting story of humanity	A very haunting account, which ripples were still felt long after I put down the book.  I found myself referring to the front of the book and read the 'in memory' list of people whenever I came across a new character.  Knowing that this character, whom the author described so vividly, would die eventually and that this was no fiction, made it a rather heart-wrenching read.  The author told us about their drive behind their love affair for Everest, their family, their personality, their commendable achievement, how each of them were coping with the preparation for the summit climb etc.  I came to get interested, admire, and like these characters.  There was a sense of great loss and sadness when I found out that the these characters would perish on the fateful day.  Rob, Scott, Andy and Doug were some of the men whom captured your heart but eventually perished.<br />This was a story about men's irrational passion with the challenge of Everest and the folly which led to the men's demise in her arms.  There were a lot of 'what ifs' and the desperate wish that one could turn back the clock.  With hindsight, many things appeared to be so clear, so easily preventable.  But logical and wise judgement was a precious but lacking element in such irrational passion to conquer.<br />You don't have to know or love mountaineering to appreciate the book.  As a layman to mountaineering, I was constantly fascinated by the interesting information and insights littered throughout the story.  The writing style was rather unpretentious and sincere.  At times, I felt that the author was frustrated that mere words were not reflective of the dire situation and grievious feelings.  It is also a story offers great insights to humanity and behavioural traits.  It must be hard to find equally trying and intense circumstances to bring out the best and worst of mankind.  I hope it enlightens me in some ways and I look forward to more such reading experience.	2002-10-15

That setting gave a lot of allowance for the extent of crude treatment of women, for exmaple: female slaves were treated almost like whores if they were comely, Ware had women to service his sexual needs at his beck and call, existence of harem and total submission to the men etc.  One should bear in mind that such was oppressive setting thus not to expect it to be too romantic.<br />My main complaint about the book was the rivalry and alliance between the various tribes and factions, which I had problem following.  Also, the talk of the legends and God were confusing.<br />Ware was a hard man who tried to be heartless.  Thea was determined and single-minded about what she wanted.  But the most enjoyable exchanges were those between Kadar and Selene.  I noticed that Iris Johansen's books always have a secondary character with amusing sense of humour, whom we often liked as much if not more than the lead characters.  And Kadar was, as usual, delightful.<br />A minor disappointment in the book was that I wished Ware and Vaden could be together as brothers again after they left behind their baggage, but it didn't happen.<br />Overall, it was not a flawless and impressive story as compared to other IJ's books, but enjoyable still.  Wish there were more steamy scenes though.	2002-10-03

The story was easy to read with the right pace and the plot development was not too heavy, just the kind of book you like to curl up and immense in during weekend or vacation.  I like the chemistry between Wolf and Mary, it was as if they were meant for each other right from the beginning.  Joe was very likeable too and it's great to know that there is a book on him and more.  Both men and Mary were so protective over the persons they loved that they appeared to belong to each other as a family.  It's a story that you feel good reading it.	2002-09-30

He is handsome but limping and scarred, comfortable but not rich as his household had no servants and they all had to work in the fields, widowed and with 2 sons, not very chivalous or gentlemanly.  Caroline was beautiful and brave, but she was also a cook, housekeeper and nurse to the household of 6 hostile and distrustful males, doing almost a maid would do and more.  Matt was Caroline's brother-in-law and her sister, Elizabeth, had caused enough damage to the family for them to trust anyone related to her.  Both had a past that hurt them and not entirely healed from it.<br />These were unusual background to develop a romantic story.  It was refreshing from those rich and powerful hero, smart and brave but helpless heroine.  This was no fairytale.  But the author managed to weave a story with strong character development.  It was more than a love story, more a family story.<br />Sometime I found the story a tart too slow but the unfolding events were necessary to develop the story and characters: Matt's injury and subsequent recovery under Caroline's care helped to dispell distrust, ignite passions and reveal secrets; Daniel's kiss awakened the feelings, Caroline's kidnap and rescue provided the much needed solitude and privacy for them; and the rescue of Caroline from the fire.  Almost all characters emerged stronger and closer from these events.	2002-09-24

This has been a delightful read, sweet and charming but not too spellbinding.  The theme of legends from the exotic regions sort of set the backdrop of the story in a surreal and fantasy atmosphere.  So it almost reads like a fairy tale.  As usual, the lady is smart but innocent and able to see beyond the facade of her man.  The plot twists are not dramatic or suspenseful enough, too mild that they did not tingle much excitement from the reader.	2002-09-23

The writing style and pace of the story were just compelling for you to keep the pages turning and in no time, the story ended.  I liked the characters, Chance and Sunny, plus other supporting characters from the MacKenzie's family.  Chance was an all dependable hero and appeared to know what to do even in the most dire situations.  He was very smart and manly, great sense of humour and of course, sexy and passionate.  Sunny was just amazing.  She is bright and sincere, with a touch of innocence.  But she was also resourceful, brave and determined.  I loved the way they teased and matched wit with each other.  Now, I'm hooked to read all the books on the MacKenzies from the beginning!	2002-09-20

Elizabeth did appear rather stupid and naive initially.  I was not convinced by the plot of exchanging James' room key as a way to delay him, after all, she believed that James would pursue her so as to help her and Elizabeth truly needed any help she could get then.  That was not a very pleasant way to treat someone who was kind enough to offer comfort to a complete stranger.  And wrecking Lo Peng's opium den alone was a stupid act.  If Lo Peng was as powerful and evil as we were made believed, he could easily kill or kidnap Elizabeth at his den instead of had her arrested by the police and made a fuss about extorting compensation.  I really wondered about Elizabeth's intelligence about fighting someone who was out to help her and antagonising someone who was capable of all evil, when she was alone, helpless and penniless.  It was James who saved the story like a saint.  The way the book told us of his patience, his love, his devotion and care towards his adopted children and Elizabeth, were just too good to be true in reality.  Even the brief mention of his love and devotion to his ex-wife, Mei Ling, was touching.  All in all, a tender love story but lack the brillance to make it spellbinding one.	2002-09-12

I didn't feel as attached to Alex and Caitlin as I was to Lion and Sanchia.  Alex deceived Caitlin so as to use her as part of his revenge.  Knowing Ledford, Alex should know what kind of danger he would expose his pawns to when the stake increased, he couldn't be so unscrupulous to disregard that.  In a way, it casted Alex as a very manipulative man, though I do like him.  At least Lion didn't lie to Sanchia about his intention to use her.  Hmmm, the scenes on the couch and in the shower were tantalising. The character development of the supporting characters was not as compelling.  I wished to get deeper into the character of Jonanthan Andreas, but there was not much offered.  I liked the wit and charm of Kemal, of course, including the ending, which was delightful.  Overall, I was impressed with the way the author plotted the Wind Dancer for publicity of the perfume.  But I found the 'secrets' of the Wind Dancer a little far-fetched.	2002-09-09

I was a little surprised that the Jordan and Marianna succumbed to their passions after 3 long years.  I found that a little stretched given the intensity of how they felt towards each other.  The first half of the book was a bit dull.  It was unclear whether Jordan tried to seduce Marianna because of his pent up lust or was he induced by the time urgency to get the Jeledar from her and thought seductive persuasion was the way to go.  It was not convincing how the Jeledar could protect Kazan from Napoleon, in the end, it was a little anti-climax.  I liked the part when Jordan trailed Marianna to ther destination.  That illustrated Marianna's determination, resourcefulness and courage, which earned Jordan's and his troops' admiration and love.  Because before that, we only knew that Marianna was a gifted in making stained-glass, had a mind of her own, stubborn and not with a very clear objective what she wanted to do other than protecting Alex and the Jeledar.  Overall, I found the plot and character development a bit under my expectation but an enjoyable read nevertheless.	2002-09-02

It's that kind of book that you can't wait to know the story and yet feel a sense of loss when you do.<br />I enjoyed the story every much and marveled at the plot twists. There was good character development too. As the story progressed, you found out more about the inner feelings of the characters through the events that happened. All characters were very well developed, Sanchia, Lion, Lorenzo, Caterina, even Marco and Bianca. I particularly liked the sense of humour of Lorenzo. <br />The unfolding events will grip you and send you feeling the anguish and horror experienced by the characters. Unlike a war, the casualties may be faceless victims, but the author had built the characters so well that you will empathise with their grief, mourn their loss and admire their courage.<br />Other than the tormenting unfortunate events in the story, the love between Lion and Sanchia was full of tormenting anguish and frustration with the circumstances. Oh, I so love the lead characters!<br />Unforgettable.....	2002-08-29

And I found it hard to imagine how Simon was attracted to her (which it appeared to be so), even though he meant to marry her for revenge.  Anyway, as the story progressed, it was getting more interesting.  Simon ended up not as mean as one would expect from someone seeking revenge but Emily's naivety bordered between boldness and stupidity.  Nevertheless, I do find myself enjoying the read, minus some of the literary lines.  It's always sweet to see Simon falling in love with Emily through his behaviour.	2002-08-26
US	51872419	R3JTHY93XCXCEN	0553299468	705345090	Midnight Warrior	Books	4	1	1	N	N	May my man be like Gage	Midnight Warrior is my second book from Iris Johansen after The Magnificent Rouge.  I must say that I enjoy the plot of the Magnificent Rouge better.  Somehow in comparison, the plot twists in this book were less surprising.  The supporting characters are weaker compared to those in Magnificent Rouge.  Nevertheless, I like the Gage and Brynn.  I wish I have such a protector and lover like Gage, as steadfast as a tower, he promised and delivered, he is very possessive in a very exciting way.  I find Brynn's stubbornness a bit tormenting not only for Gage, but for herself and the reader.  I wish she was more expressive and spontaneous in her feelings.	2002-08-22

The story was so flat and ridiculous.  There was little character-building and the plot was too predictable.  I find it hard to like and respect the lovers, well, we needed more convincing that they were in love because all we read was their lust towards each other.  And talk about lust, even Susan Johnson's trademark erotic sex scenes were lousy and sloppy.	2002-08-20

Ya, it's trashy.  But SJ is the most reliable writer to come up with with sex scenes that really sizzle.  When I want a change and look forward to more erotic sex scenes, I look for SJ's books.  This is probably not her best but I happened to keep it for the erotic sex scenes.  She usually promises at least a good one towards the end of the book and this book has 2.  What about storyline?  Well, it should not be the main reason to read SJ's book.  Storyline is merely a backdrop for her sex scenes.	2002-08-16

I liked the twists of plot and the characters (including various supporting characters).  It was also a little refreshing that it was not another case of one of them wrongly wronged the other person blah, blah, then everything was cleared up.  And I look forward to read more of Iris Johansen's books!	2002-08-16

Frankly, that's the key reason to read her books in the first place.  But really, those scenes in this book are too plain and forgettable.  And the story?  Quite a yawn.  All in all, a flat and forgettable book.	2002-08-16

The synopsis and writing style of the book appealed to me and it met my need to have light book to read then.<br />I like the book very much.  Partly because the story 'talks' to me and touches me.  I can relate to the carefree days and having each other as their world during their travels and the separation across an ocean.  It brought back familiar and buried feelings.<br />A light and easy read but the story will haunt you.  The repercussions of the choices we make now can define the rest of our life.  Sometimes, the best choices need a little selfishness and loads of courage.	2001-07-25

After the release of the Clayborne Brides, can't wait to read about what the author has in mind for Cole, the mean one.  Should be the most interesting as I was looking forward to to how his relationship with Eleanor would develop.  Anyway, the author may have other ideas.	1998-08-10
