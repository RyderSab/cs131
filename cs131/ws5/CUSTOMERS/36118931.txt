Does this sound familiar? Before beginning to read this book, I looked at the inside cover and immediately believed I was going to endure a literate, extended version of 'Behind the Music' (only without the music, drugs, or groupies). Well, everyone knows that they say about judging books by their cover, right? Room to Grow by Tracey Gold is about her life and her battle with anorexia, but if you're looking for preachy, 'look-at-poor-beautiful-me,' tear glistening in eye cripe, then you won't find it here. <br />Room to Grow uses fairly simple language to show the development of a problem, the recognition and the conquering of it. Throughout the book, one accepts that acting was simply something Gold did. It didn't define her and it wasn't the cause of her anorexia. Like most little girls, Gold had grown up wanting to please and (with a little help from movies and books) began to believe that if she was skinnier, it would be better. The book itself is not so much autobiographical as it is informative. Gold's life acts simply as a backdrop to the main topic, a disease that kills. <br />Gold isn't asking for sympathy. She explains this in the first chapter. She just wants to know that somebody read this and it helped them to better understand the disease and to seek help if they have it. Well, I read it and I commend her for caring enough to write it. ...	2003-07-28

Handel writes, \\"The success of Blue Jean is and always has been due to the involvement of girls who make it all happen. Without them there is no Blue Jean. I'm often asked, 'How did you get such a great idea and what inspired you?' The answer is simple...Girls and young women should be creating their own media. To me it is obvious and should have happened a long time ago.\\" <br />Blue Jean: What Young Women are Thinking, Saying and Doing, a compilation of articles from back issues of Blue Jean Magazine fully captures this feminist spirit that Handel describes. It reveals the originality possible when media is created by its own demographic. No mainstream teen magazine can compare in authenticity and honesty to Blue Jean because Blue Jean is the only publication teenage girls control and write for themselves. It reads like a breath of fresh air.<br />I was very impressed by the \\"do it yourself\\" message promoted in many of the chapters, especially in chapter one, \\"Volunteerism and Activism.\\" In this chapter there is a nice balance between essays by girls who have experienced hands on the pleasures of creating something themselves, and appreciative reports about the activism carried out by girls around them. For example, in her essay \\"Chix with Sticks,\\" Courtney Martin describes how she and her peers formed a Women's Lacrosse team at her high school. By narrating her own struggles and successes, she offers sound advice and encouragement to girls who may want to start their own team. Alternatively, Larissa Masny's aricle, \\"Insight into the Seeing Eye,\\" focuses not on herself, but another girl's efforts working for a Seeing Eye dog center. The combination of first hand stories and second hand reports in \\"Volunteerism and Activism\\" suggests how important it is for girls to do things themselves, but also recognize achievements in others. <BR> <BR>I particularly enjoyed chapter three, \\"Feminism.\\" I liked reading how different girls answered thequestion, \\"What does feminism mean to you?\\" There is no better way to understand the complexities of feminism and the women's movement than through reading a variety of opinions. By creating a written discussion on feminism, the article mirrors the sort of debate girls will experience in the real world. \\"Feminism\\" is a highly contested word; a fact Blue Jean does not efface, but rather embraces by encouraging so many different responses. Victoria Nam's essay, \\"Why We Love and Fear the F-Word,\\" was similarly impressive. She thoughtfully approaches the topic of \\"girl power\\" feminism. She neither completely dismisses \\"girl power\\" feminism as might older feminists, nor does she shield it from criticism. She concedes, \\"Girls are recycling words and wearing clothes that have been used against women in the past, but this time they are using them to their advantage\\" but still insists that \\"relying on T-shirts and stickers for inspiration and meaning celebrates the present and erases the past.\\" I am encouraged and inspired by Victoria's insightful commentary.<BR> <BR>In the introduction, Handel includes a letter written to her by Kristin Purdy, one of the girls originally involved in Blue Jean. Kristin writes, \\"Blue Jean is an intangible grassroots global network of girl power -- uniting girls and young women (and some old women also). In a way it carries a spirit that  made me realize we are all feminists.\\" Kristin's words underline  Blue Jean's greatest accomplishment: it creates a lasting sorority among young women. Blue Jean: What Young Women are Thinking, Saying, and Doing motivates feminist thought  during a key transistion -- adolescence. The result is the creation of a feminist community that is broad and undefined, but because it is formed at such a pivotal moment, permanently connected.	2003-07-15

Many who have attempted this challenge failed and came out looking ignorant and insensitive of certain aspects of the culture. Few have succeeded, and among them is Anita Desai. <br />The reader is faced with several poignant issues played upon in a middle-class family attempting to deal with modernization, but they ultimately that realize life is meant to be lived in their society. A society with a veritable amount of prejudices weaved into its complex tapestry of customs and beliefs.<br />The story in itself is told from the perspective of the protagonist, Uma, who starts out as a wide-eyed child at a convent who has an enthusiasm for education and an awe of the enigmatic nuns who seem to glide through the school grounds. Unlike her younger sister Aruna, our protagonist does not have the privilege of having \\"books marked healthily in green and blue for success and approval.\\" Instead, with the birth of her brother Arun, Uma takes on the role of nanny. Here, one encounters the distinct preference her parents have for the male child - a practice that was not uncommon at the time. The teenage Uma questions this sexism when she points out that an ayah had looked after both Aruna and herself as children. Why wasn't the ayah's care sufficient for a male child? <br />Desai next explores the conventional belief that tied a woman's worth to her physical appearance. A woman who lacked beauty was often rushed into the first marital offer she received, only to pay a heavy price later on. Desai shows the challenges a single woman faces regardless of how successful she is. By contrast, Uma's cousin is portrayed as the ultimate success because she is able to marry well thanks to her looks. One wonders how happy she truly was, however, when she eventually takes her own life. <br />Arun, Uma's brother, takes center stage several chapters into the book as he begins his studies in America, where he meets the dysfunctional Patton family. Arun is faced with unlimited freedom and grapples with an alien culture in which his landlord's daughter periodically vomits after meals and Ms. Patton is almost a non-entity in the family.<br />Ultimately, Anita Desai has established herself as one of India's finest fiction writers. To me, great authors are the ones who can make you keep turning the pages, eager to read the next line although there may be more pressing matters at hand - and Desai fulfills that description....	2003-07-15

Between Two Junes is a Forest: A Journal of Everything, by Geoffrey Dilenschneider, allows us to do just that - with a twist. The book is written as a year in the life of a poet - not just somebody who writes poetry, but a person who lives, breathes, and sees poetry in whatever he does and wherever he goes.<br />As I was reading the first chapters of the book, I thought, \\"This guy can't be for real. Nobody feels this much or thinks this eloquently.\\" The book itself stands apart from the author. Between Two Junes is a Forest does not stray from its purpose: It is the emotional release of a teenage boy who faces his emotions with an acceptance unheard of for teenagers. The essays and poems may be confusing at times because they are not crafted with the eye and precision of a professional set on perfection. They are simply outpourings of one individual in his self-search. It is not Dilenschneider's mission to reveal to the reader some grand societal message behind the subtle metaphors and ironic storylines. This is his truth and these words are the lasting proof of what he has learned.<br />As always, what readers takes from this heady piece is up to them. They must never forget that the book is written through the perspective of a single lens. I did not agree with some of his opinions, but I can not deny that I admire him for having these opinions and for being able to express them with such precision and grace. It is the mark of gifted linguist and talented writer. <br />Copyright 2003 BlueJeanOnline.com	2003-07-15

They say war isn't an appropriate subject for young people, and you know what? I agree. But war doesn't care. That's why I decided to put this book together.\\" -Jennifer Armstrong<br />Shattered is a thoughtful and moving look at an all too timely topic: war. Editor Jennifer Armstrong has compiled a wide variety of short stories about the wartime experiences of children. A young Palestinian daughter flees to Jordan with her family during the Six-Day War in 1967. A young girl nicknamed Jacket helps hide her best friend's older brother when he is a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. Lewis Bowman, a young Mohawk, fights with the Union army during the American Civil War. Zack struggles with his American background during a 1992 \\"golpe de estado\\" in Latin America. A family of children faces the devastating effects of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Two children struggle to find safety in Israel after surviving Auschwitz.<br />This book treats children's experiences with respect. Many of the authors speak from their own memories, and those authors writing fiction capture the intensity, the vulnerability, and the strength of childhood. I have to admit that at first the titled worried me. It is very easy to reduce children to their worst experiences and to neglect other aspects of their human identities so that their suffering is easier for others to process. However, this book's articulation of the perspective of children is honest, and for the most part it succeeds in being authentic. It is moving and, as it should be, troubling. <br />Given the reality of conflict that we currently face, it is vital to remember the devastation of war, and the destruction of life that is left in its wake. Children are not safeguarded from that violence. Armstrong has succeeded in creating a diverse, compassionate, and important look at children and war.	2003-04-07

On one hand, I had seen the creative talents working on Blue Jean Online but on the other hand, I had read many paltry attempts of young women attempting to address issues they knew little of. I should have known better than to doubt Blue Jean. <br />Numerous young women individually mold subjects that are close to their hearts ranging from the meaning of feminism, the attention deficit disorder to the dilemmas of mixed parentage. The success of their writing lies in a simple formula that each young woman adopted and that was to write about something that they knew and felt intimately about. Dina Rabadi, 21, dispells the myths of studying in a women's college through her honest insight into the hidden benefits of studying at Smith College. I find myself re-evaluating my own choices for college and wondering why a women's college is conspicuously absent from my own list. It is this kind of writing that compels me to look inward and to reflect instead of simply heaving a sigh of relief at the end of an estrogen pumped collection of works. Erica Bryant, 16, reaches beyond the pages of the book through her mature outlook on \\"Black Feminists Talkin' Back\\". Being an Indian, I found myself unconsciously nodding my head as I read her piece that tackled the double prejudice of being a colored woman. When I read the various pieces, it wasn't so much the writer's creativity or fluency that captured my attention, but the sincerity with which they wrote. With Lida Haber-Thompson's piece on the attention deficit disorder, there is a conscious effort to take this condition out of a medical journal and put it into the words of a teenager. What made me want to know more about the disorder was the turmoil within Lisa's that is reflected in her words. Anne Preller, 15, presents an informative and passionate piece on sexual harassment that made me stop to think of the times I may have dismissed something I was not comfortable with for fear of being called school marmish or priggish. <br />Blue Jean: What Young Women are Thinking, Saying, and Doing is crucial in creating a sense of solidarity amidst young women who are separated by geographical and cultural boundaries. That leap in one's heart to see that \\"I'm not the only one who feels this way\\" is what a collection of such works offers young women everywhere. It's captivating to read the way young women have jumped at the opportunity to defend their own beliefs and to stand up to the flawed images of women that one is constantly bombarded with by parents, boyfriends, tradition and the media. Sarabeth Matilsky and Danielle Kabelle, both 16, look at the manner in which gender stereotypes are instilled in us from childhood and whether size determines beauty, respectively. Such writing is living proof that while there is a majority that strives to achieve Barbie-like proportions, there is a significant minority that determines success and beauty by their own standards. <br />Alongside these key issues, Blue Jean: What Young Women are Thinking, Saying, and Doing showcases young talents in creative writing that build new worlds for us to venture into through the words on a page. If I could, I would go on and on about what a feast this book is for the reader, but I think Julia Rodriguez sums this book and what it represents beautifully in the last two lines of her short story \\"Lilacs Bloom Every Spring\\". \\"We will find our right to be. Until then, lilacs bloom every spring\\".	2003-03-28

They speak about the moment and how eternal that moment can be. Some of the poems are subtle, others are written shouts. There are many times when the last line of one of the poems knocks the breath out of you. In poems like \\"Lucifer's Pillows,\\" Marcus gives us doses of painful nostalgia, while in poems like \\"talk to me like autumn,\\" she creates smooth imagery that soothes the soul. <br />Although some of the situations may not be the same, the utter feeling behind them leaves you with a sense of déjà vu. No, we may not have experienced what the speaker of the poem has experienced, but we have felt the same emotions. To make us realize this, and to do it so naturally, is quite a feat. Talk to Me Like Autumn is the kind of collection you should read every few years in order to experience the emotions you've forgotten all over again. Some of the poems need to be read aloud so that the taste can bounce off your tongue, while others need to be read silently so that the thought behind them can sink into your mind. <br />There are some poems, however, that have a bitter (almost humorous) reality to them. The last line of \\"The Poem That Got me in Trouble in Social Studies\\" had me laughing, while \\"Tiptoes\\" had me shocked and waiting. One of the things that make poems so good is their honesty, and believe me, Talk to Me Like Autumn is full of honesty...	2003-03-02

In a world full of beauty do and don't magazines and other superficial publications, this compilation is purely refreshing. Blue Jean: What Young Women are Thinking, Saying, and Doing allows for teenage girls to read about significant issues that pertain to all, not just what shade of pink is in for this spring. This anthology starts with a bang, and influences readers to get out and actually do something. In the first chapter, volunteering and activism is addressed. It tells of actual things that young women have already accomplished, such as the one with girls assisting with a seeing-eye dog project. This book goes beyond simply telling, it encourages activism, not just dreaming, doing. <br />Between the pages that bring down feminist stereotypes and help for the mind and soul lay the true feelings and emotions of all girls. Though targeted at the 14-19 set, Blue Jean: What Young Women are Thinking, Saying, and Doing defies age barriers. It is a collection of illuminating words that evoke dreams, hopes, and stories. Most importantly, it explains that common phrase \\"if you don't succeed at first, try, try again.\\" Rather then put pressure on women, Blue Jean uplifts and helps girls shape themselves into independent, self-sufficient women. It does not make women feel as though clothes, makeup, and hot-dates define who we are, rather it coaxes our inner spirit and drive to challenge and overcome setbacks.	2003-02-27

Blue Jean: What Young Women are Thinking, Saying, and Doing is more than just a book; it is a resource that will guide and teach you about situations you may face in this challenging world.

My spirit was uplifted and brought to a new level as I read \\"The Key to Confidence\\". The story,\\"Black Feminists Talkin' Back\\", really touched home because it expressed the conflict of how African-American women feel separated between sexism and racism. The amazing question and answer section, \\"Dear Dr. Beth\\", gave great advice on difficult everyday experiences that young women deal with. These are just a few of the many terrific articles that will make you really dig deeper in learning about who you are as an individual. <br />Additionally, the book devotes a section on how you can publish your own zine, reviews of other zines, and information on how you can contribute your writings to Blue Jean Online ....This book should be in every young lady's collection.

In the Moso culture, women hold an honored place, and families are matrilineal. Yet young Yang Erche Namu feels trapped by society's expectations of her. As she grows into a strong-willed young woman, she decides to leave the Moso to pursue her dream of becoming a singer. Forsaking her ties to her family and her people, Namu relies on her own determination and resourcefulness to brave the unforgiving world. But Namu is caught between two ways of life, and this struggle eventually becomes the focus of the story. <br />Namu, now a famous singer, wrote this memoir with the help of Christine Mathieu, an expert on the Moso people and their history. The authors' passion for this story and for the Moso people resonates with every sentence. Moso traditions and beliefs are a departure from almost any we encounter in today's world, and the book is worth reading for that reason alone. Leaving Mother Lake is a lovingly crafted tribute to this enchanting but little-known culture, with all its legend and lore. <br />Namu and Mathieu use wonderful details to paint a picture of the Moso people and their home. \\"Red granite and evergreen forests towered over the meadow, and peaks like saw teeth pierced the blue sky, slicing through feathery clouds - ridge after ridge, and as far as I could see,\\" they write. \\"The air was so pure, so still, so empty of familiar smells and sounds that I might have become frightened if I had not been overwhelmed by so much wild beauty\\" (80). This calm beauty of the Moso villages later contrasts the rowdiness of the city streets Namu will visit. <br />Despite its unique setting, the themes of Leaving Mother Lake reach effortlessly across cultural differences. We laugh and cry with our heroine, and we identify with her feelings of confinement and longing.Leaving Mother Lake is primarily a book about love, loyalty, duty, and desire. That Namu and Mathieu can convey these emotions across the vast cultural differences is a testament to their storytelling abilities; their use of exquisite imagery and rich description make the story all the more enjoyable. <br />Copyright 2003, Blue Jean Online	2003-02-09

Each generation is studied, packaged, and shipped out with a name. What will this generation of the new millennium eventually be called? Will it be Generation Destruction, Generation Party, or Generation Privileged? To prove that teenagers in America aren't just a bunch of lazy couch potatoes, Elizabeth Rusch has put together a collection of stories about young people who have done something to change the world for the better. These stories vary--for example, one is about a young girl who gave an intelligent speech, while another is about a boy who managed to collect hundreds of cereal boxes for the hungry.<br />After every story, there is a \\"What You Can Do\\" list and quotes from other young people with ideas. The common thing among all the stories (and the thing that makes each story so endearing) is that these kids did not start out wanting to change the world. They just saw something wrong and decided to fix it. After every story there is \\"Your Solution,\\" a blank page where you can write how you would or could change the world. <br />What I found particularly inspiring about this book is that none of the kids even considered the possibility that their ideas would not work. They just knew it could be done. Some of these kids had intelligence on their side, others just plain courage. It doesn't matter, though, because in the end all of their dreams became a reality. We know because their stories are in this book.	2003-01-22

Mindy Morgenstern's musings can be hilarious and zany, but always lead to a genuine message that fosters self-esteem and confidence.<br />The book is divided into sections for romance, work, social life, family, money, and life tips. Each contains offbeat words of wisdom accompanied by comical pictures and quotations from Gloria Steinem, Maya Angelou, and others. <br />\\"The football captains of today are the burger jockeys of tomorrow,\\" Morgenstern proclaims, describing a scene in which you, a Nobel laureate and nominee for president, run into that heartthrob from sophomore year who is now an Assistant Manager at McDonalds. \\"If there isn't a door, kick in a wall,\\" she advises. \\"Jobs will ... along the way,\\" reads another caption.<br />It is this kind of frankness that will have older generations nodding their heads in agreement and younger girls eager to read more. The message Morgenstern delivers is to live life to its fullest, pursuing dreams and taking advantage of every opportunity. It is effectively conveyed by creative layouts and entertaining personal stories, making the book a quick and fun read. The Real Rules for Girls makes a great gift and will be enjoyed time and again by young women of all ages. <br /> <BR>Copyright 2002 Blue Jean Online	2003-01-12

The originality of the book's title and its unconventional cover immediately attracted me. And I was curious: just how many Asian-American feminists are there, anyway?<br />As I began reading, I was caught off guard by the style and complexity of the writing. Dragon Ladies is a collection of essays written by various Asian-American activists-it's no light-hearted novel that you can breeze through. There's plenty of historical information, which can be dry at times (this could easily be used as a reference if you were writing a paper on feminists). But the majority of the essays contain thought-provoking discussions of serious issues that every young woman should reflect upon.<br />The contributors take different approaches to their subjects, which range from sexuality to domestic violence to the plight of workers, but they share a passion for their cause that is evident in every word of the book. Having little experience in political activism, I enjoyed reading the women's anecdotes depicting their struggles and successes.<br />The same conviction that makes the book worthwhile, however, may also turn off some of its readers. Even I, a liberal young Asian-American woman, found some of the essays too radical to be realistic. But the point of the book isn't necessarily to propagate these beliefs. As editor Sonia Shah explains in the introduction, \\"...[This book] provides a set of issues, terms, ideas, and stories for folks to talk about-whether it is to debunk and decry them or to transform them into an agenda for action.\\"<br />Even if the book doesn't inspire you to become politically active, it will at least make you ponder some significant issues and reexamine your own beliefs. Read Dragon Ladies with an open mind, and you will gain from it.<br />Copyright 2002, Blue Jean Online	2003-01-12

Very few times, however, do they mention what helps these girls survive: their friends. In Teen Girlfriends, Julia DeVillers puts together a compilation of different situations among friends. The book goes through all topics, from popularity to road trips. The stories are cute, if slightly off the reality slide. Friendship is a unique thing, different in every situation, and the major flaw of the book is that it tries to generalize and explain too much. The purpose of the book is slightly confusing. It is very similar to one long essay, and though it services those needing illumination of the term 'friendship,' it hardly captures the interests of real teenagers who know what true friendship is about. <br />Reading this book made me feel as if I were getting a lecture about how I should feel in certain situations. DeVillers brings up an event that could have happened and justifies it with a quote from a girl the reader most likely does not know. I never felt that I was truly introduced to the girls who contributed to the book. DeVillers often uses the term 'we' to include the reader, which I found disconcerting because it reminded me of a parent clarifying the world for me. The whole book just gave me an awkward feel. <br />The book does have some redeeming qualities, though. It acts similarly to a self-help book in that it tells readers that they are not the only ones to experience a certain situation. Though not a big fan of self-help books myself, I can understand DeVillers' purpose and admire her for it. Very few books pay close attention to teenage girls. This one at least makes an effort. <br />Copyright 2003 Blue Jean Online	2003-01-09

This book does not tell a young woman how to snag that \\"perfect\\" man or how to spend hours putting on make-up. Young women are bombarded enough by these images that tell them they must improve their looks because, of course, their looks are not good enough to be the object of a man's desires. Instead this book shows how young women are changing the world one voice at a time. The book is written and edited by young women who are questioning the world around them and not just blindly accepting it. They are activists. After finishing this book, my heart was warmed and my spirits raised by these courageous young women who voiced their thoughts. It gave me the confidence I needed to believe in my ideas and opinions. <br />Thank you Blue Jean for making available a safe place where young women can voice their concerns and views on the world. As a young woman myself, I am proud to call myself a feminist.	2002-12-31

Sit down and watch some television. How many ads do you see for gyms, how many infomercials for a \\"revolutionary weight loss drug,\\" \\"a 48-hour weight loss drink,\\" and a \\"diet plan that will help you lose as much weight as you want\\"? <br />Of all the diets and weight-loss programs out there, how many are playing off the insecurities of teenagers and the rest of the target audience? <br />Industry of Illusions, by Stephen Grisanti, asks that question in page after page of opinions geared toward exposing the fraudulent goings-on of the weight-loss industry. His main point: sucking misinformed teens into their money-making scheme is just one big game for these companies. <br />I've often looked at size double-zero models gracing the cover of magazines, on television shows, and pretty much everywhere in society and felt inadequate in some sort of way. This book has some good, though one-sided, points to make the reader aware that the weight-loss industry isn't always helpful; it's sometimes harmful and degrading.<br />This book is a good read; it is clear and concise, and Gristanti's voice and opinion are strong throughout. Perhaps more facts from studies and statistical sources would make some of Gristanti's claims a bit more understandable, but the basis of the book is Gristanti expressing his disgust and exposing the reality of the weight-loss industry. <br />Clearly, Gristanti's personal crusade is the driving force behind this book, and one should understand that before reading it. The crusade is a noble one, however, and Gristanti deftly shows how most of the advertisements and entertainment industries falsify the ideal image of how we should look. <BR> <BR>Copyright 2002, Blue Jean Online.	2002-12-31

Stoddard, Correspondent<br />In today's job search, it has become apparent that it is not enough to present future employers with a degree. More and more, internships act as the gateway to great careers. Therefore, Scoring a Great Internship, part of the \\"Students Helping Students\\" line from Natavi Guides, is a great starting point for any student who has entered or will enter the search for an internship. <br />Blue Jean's own Ellen Rubinstein is the primary author of Scoring a Great Internship, but the guide also contains a variety of firsthand experiences from students at schools like Cornell, Yale, and Bryn Mawr College. Thanks to the advice of these students and the depth of Rubenstein's experiences, the guide avoids pitfalls such as preaching to its audience. For people like me that may not have someone older and more experienced to look to for internship advice, the guide is a practical, friendly source of information. You can trust that each tip has been put to the test by students like Rubinstein.<br />Thanks to its simple organization, the guide becomes a tool you may return to whenever a question arises. Each section tackles another aspect of internships, leading you from the search for internships to what to do once you receive an internship. This is definitely something you'll want to leave on your desk for future reference. <br />I appreciated the straightforward examples Scoring a Great Internship offered. Oftentimes, how-to books elaborate on the importance of cover letters and resumes but fail to provide clear examples of them. This guide acts on its advice by offering samples of actual cover letters and resumes and breaking them down by paragraph or section. Simple enough, right? <br />Furthermore, this guide offers an extensive list of resources. With tons of web addresses provided, you can do everything from learn more about interning to searching for actual internships. There is no guarantee that you'llscore your great internship because of this guide, but this is certainly a surefire way to avoid the mistakes of fellow intern-seeking rookies. <br />Copyright 2002, Blue Jean Media, Inc.	2002-12-02

Her mother is the most beautiful woman in the town, and her older sister Samantha is a rebel who tries her best to be everything that their mom isn't. Suddenly, on Teri's birthday, her house burns down and her life changes. Suddenly, her crush (the cutest boy in school) breaks up with his girlfriend and wants to go out with her. Suddenly, she starts developing feelings for her best friend, and suddenly her mother (who rarely settles on a man) decides that she's in love with Nolan, her current amour. Teri's world is completely altered. Are you yawning yet? Is this plot a little too familiar? <br />Falling From Fire has a promising and original idea in Teri's birthday cake burning down her house. Unfortunately, that's probably the only original thing in the book. The characters are one-dimensional, and the plot drops dead at your feet. It is as though the author, Teena Booth, took all of the teen stereotypes she could think of and crammed them into a book. The book's purpose isn't to tell us a story or teach us a lesson. Rather, it stalls trying too hard to get the reader to feel something. There's one scene where Teri ends up drinking. This (like many other scenes in the book) seems to have been just thrown in.  Oh, here's something else! Teen alcoholism! Feel something, darn it!<br />After I read the first couple of pages and the side of the book, I pretty much knew what was going to happen. Expecting the characters or the plot to surprise you is like expecting a cat to talk. It just isn't going to happen. Even at the end, when Nolan tells Samantha he plans to marry her mother-was the reader really supposed to be shocked? A happy ending for insecure Teri Dinsmore, who loves and hates her mom, who loves and hates her sister, who loves and hates her best friend, is pretty much expected. Oh, and did I mention that Samantha takes drugs and plans to run away with her boyfriend, only to change her mind and come back tofinish high school because it's the right thing to do?<br />The only part that gave me a twinge of feeling was when Teri's younger brother left with his alcoholic father. You can't help but feel for the poor kid who is neglected by nearly everyone around him. Maybe if Booth had given the rest of the characters the same honesty she gives Teri's brother, the book would have been better.  Who knows?<br />My advice? Go read the dictionary. You'll learn something new and won't be half as bored.<br />	2002-10-08

Raven has always been determined to move out of the projects and go to college like her older sister Dell, but her goal is put on hold when she becomes pregnant and drops out of high school to have the baby. After the birth of her son, Raven spends her days at home with occasional visits from her best friend, Aisha, another high school dropout and single mother. Raven starts to lose hope that she will ever leave the projects but then she learns of a spelling bee with a grand prize of a college scholarship. She spends all of her waking hours preparing for the bee and eventually realizes her dream because of her hard work. <br />This is a classic story of a young woman who has a goal and doesn't let a few bumps along the way stop her from achieving it. Raven's ability to defy the odds is inspirational. The plot is a bit weak, but the laugh-out-loud funny moments make it a worthwhile read. <br />McDonald should be congratulated for brilliantly capturing the voices of two young women from the Brooklyn projects. Spellbound is geared towards the 11-and 12-year-old crowd, but anyone can enjoy this quick read...	2002-09-19

Tricia Bott, age 16<br />What are young women thinking, saying, and doing? Are they allowing themselves to conform to society? Or are they stepping out and helping others as they do? <br />This book is about you. Yes, you! And young women everywhere who just need a little encouragement. When I first picked up my copy, I thought, \\"Well, of COURSE I know what young women are thinking, saying, and doing! I'm a young woman, right?\\" Right, but I've never helped breed seeing-eye dogs. I've never thought about the effects of feminism, chauvinism, and all the other -isms on my life. My mom has never had cancer, like in the story \\"Peaches and Dreams.\\" I've never had to deal with anyone close to me dying, but I have an idea of what that would be like thanks to Julia's story, \\"Lilacs Bloom Every Spring.\\" Now I feel like I have the ability to deal with these situations. I feel more attuned to the world. I feel empowered. And that's just what this book is about-- empowering young women.<br />Surviving the fight and beating the odds is what womanhood is all about. The \\"Speaking Out\\" section of the book elaborates on this fight. How would you deal with being homeless, like Dawn in \\"Homeless Wanderers\\"? What would you do if you were Native American and you were being forced out of your home, as is described in \\"Trouble at Big Mountain\\"? <br />Blue Jean: What Young Women are Thinking, Saying, and Doing shows how these teens took a stand-and you can, too, by reading about the different ways you can help your community. You can join Free the Children or create your own hip new zine You are woman. Let's show the world how you roar.	2002-08-23

This was not done fast or easily; and it was not done by those anonymous things, armies, divisions, regiments. It was done by men, one by one, your men.\\" -Martha Gellhorn, writing on the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 <br />Where the Action Was takes us on a journey through the past, looking at the pioneers of women journalists in action as they faced danger, death, and the images of war. Colman captures different moments throughout the war, from the very beginning, to Pearl Harbor, to the liberation of concentration camps, to the dropping of the atomic bombs. <br />The amazing tales of many talented women writers are accurately detailed, and they show us the adversities our female predecessors had to overcome for us women to be where we are today. Traveling as stowaways on boats, risking their lives to report the truth, disregarding orders given by military leaders, and being arrested all in a day's work for these stubborn and talented writers. <br />I'll bet you've never heard of Dickey Chappelle, Ann Stringer, Margaret Bourke-White, and Martha Gellhorn.

Emerging Voices Explore Culture, Identity, and Growing Up Asian American	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Truly Breathtaking, a Magnificient Anthology	by Truc Doan, age 15<BR>Teen Editor<BR>...<br />When I was reading Yell-Oh Girls! many people in my school asked me what it was about and if they could read the back. One boy had picked it up and asked me, \\"So what is this? A girly book?\\" <br />Girly book? If by girly he meant that the anthology was written by girls and targeted mainly toward girls, than yes. However, if by girly, he meant that it was somehow refined, glossed over and full of fluff, he was very wrong indeed. <br />Yell-Oh Girls! is an anthology full of passionate writing, the result of true emotion and experience. It is amazing how the young women writers that contributed to this book articulated and defined the situations and issues they wrote about. Every story, every paragraph, every sentence in this book gives the reader a blow straight to the gut and to the mind. <br />These writers do not tiptoe lightly over controversial issues, but instead state them loud and clear. The writing screams out, \\"this is who I am and this is what I went through and yes, all of it is true.\\" Even the title takes a derogatory, stereotypical phrase and changes it into something more powerful and meaningful. <br />Yell-Oh Girls! takes the all too painful experience of growing up and facing the world and mixes it with a blend of bittersweet sadness and joy. All the stories are about realizing who you are and how the people around you react to that. It is about independence, change, anger, oppression, prejudice, beauty, and courage to accept yourself for who you are. <br />Being an Asian-American female going through adolescence and heading towards the long road to adulthood and maturity, I found this book very encouraging and familiar. Yell-Oh Girls! shows that Asian-American girls are neither passive nor quiet and should not be given any label or fitted into any specific media category. <br />However, you do not have to be Asian American to connect with this anthology. The first part titled \\"Orientation\\" speaks of finding your identity and your culture. The second section, \\"Family Ties\\" contains angst filled stories that deals with one of the more important aspects of one's life...one's family. \\"Dolly Rage,\\" the third section, rages with fury and ferocity at all those that support the image of a \\"model female.\\" I especially enjoyed the last two sections, \\"Finding My Voice\\" and \\"Girlwind: Emerging Voice For Change\\" because it has personal stories of girls speaking out and acting out. <br />Yell-Oh Girls! is a truly breathtaking, magnificent anthology, and its editor, Vickie Nam, is amazing. To me, these stories send out the message, \\"Yes, girls, it's okay to yell. Yell as loud as you possibly can! Let no one stop your voice!\\"	2002-06-03

The girl next door whom we have all watched grow into a vixen has added a new title to her stardom: author. This new book, A Mother's Gift, was written by Britney and her mother, Lynn. Generally, when stars publish books they hire a ghost writer, so that was my initial impression. However, I assume someone with that much money could hire a better ghost writer, so if I were the judge I'd say the brown-haired (she's not naturally blond) babe did in fact write it with her mom. <br />Anyway, the story line. In a small town in Mississippi, everyone knows everyone else. And everyone knows Holly dreams of becoming a singer and has the voice to do it. Holly and her mom are poor but very close to each other and can talk about anything, except Dad. Holly's friends are her mom's friends too and the relation ship between the girls is somewhat Steel Magnolias-esque. A few miles down the road, there is a prestigious school for musically-talented teens which Holly dreams of attending. After her perfectly gorgeous, sweet, caring, and never overpowering boyfriend (whom her mother adores), sends a demo tape of Haley to the school, Holly is scored an auditions and soon accepted with a full scholarship. She then excels at her new school. <br />In a seemingly last minute attempt to add depth to the fairy tale, Holly's mom holds a deep, dark, secret about Holly's past which \\"threatens to tear their relationship apart.\\" However, as I hope most (hint hint) adopted girls would agree, the secret is not so bad. <br />Even though A Mother's Gift targets ten-year-olds, the writing is overly simple (\\"totally\\" is a regularly appearing adjective). I wouldn't buy it for my little sister's birthday, if I had a little sister. ...	2002-06-03

It is a sprawling history, spanning cultures, generations and several countries. Before the book is over Sasson has led us through Israel/Palestine, France, Poland, Jordan, Lebanon, and the United States.<br />I was impressed with Sasson's ability to tell a compassionate and often joyful tale without hedging around the very difficult issues surrounding the creation of the Israeli state. She never shies away from the devastating terrors and tragedy of war, nor does she forget the humanity and suffering of fighters on both sides of any conflict. The story raises many challenging questions, and Sasson never lets the reader off with easy answers.<br />There is no obvious right or wrong, only human beings locked in a painful and complicated struggle. Sasson's vast knowledge of Arab and Jewish history is impressive. As we are drawn into the lives of Palestinian refugees, Jewish holocaust survivors, and the families of German Nazis, she gives insight into the roots of a struggle that is still escalating. <br />Ester's Child is an engaging read, a book that can open your mind and your heart. ...	2002-06-03

By Molly Conway, age 14<BR>Teen Editor<BR>...<br />Ann Brashares has managed to intertwine the stories of these four best friends into one uplifting novel. <br />The plot goes as follows. Four best friends, Carmen, Tibby, Bridget and Lena are very different girls but have been best friends since their pregnant mothers were in the same aerobics class. This coming summer is going to be their first apart from each other and they find the perfect way to stay in touch, the traveling pants. This unseeingly magical pair of jeans was found at a used clothing store yet it fits each of the girls beautifully despite their drastically different shapes. <br />The pants begin their journey from girl to girl starting in Greece with Lena and her sister who are staying with their grandparents for the first time. Next they will go to Tibby who is not happy about staying home but makes the best or worst of it in her video Osuckumentary of her time working at Wallgreens. Next the pants will find their way to Carmen who is spending her first summer with her dad, and then to Bridget who is off to soccer camp. Then, they would go back to each girl in the opposite direction. <br />The story flips from the escapades of one girl to the next as the summer progresses and no one finds what they expected out of it. The book is also sprinkled with quotes as the subject of the story changes making this book very nice for someone with a short attention span. <br />Copyright 2002, Blue Jean Media, Inc.	2002-06-03

I have the utmost respect for her and her family of super-vegans because it baffles my mind as to how they do it. Whenever Rebecca and I have enough of a lull in our schedules to eat lunch together, I'm in for it if any part of my meal comes from \\"some poor animal.\\" The speech usually starts with, \\"Did you know?\\" and continues with Rebecca trying desperately to prove to me that all of the world's problems are my fault because of what I'm eating. Rebecca's argument is rehearsed and usually flawless, which is why I enjoy so immensely trying to prove her wrong, but deep down I know that she is absolutely right on most points. And that's why I've eliminated red meat from my diet. <br />If you happen to be in the same situation as me - that is, questioning your dietary identity - you might want to pick up this book. It's not just a cookbook. It also includes solid information about vegetarianism, weighs the pros and cons, gives sources for more info, and, here's the best part, nutritional information for every recipe. Plus it's geared specifically for teens so that all of the recipes are quick and easy, and it even offers tips on talking to your relatives and friends about your dietary choices.<br />But even if you aren't planning on switching your diet completely over to the green side, this is still a good book to check out. After all, according to Rebecca, if we all reduce our meat consumption by 10 percent and use the surplus grain we would have fed to livestock to feed people in Third World countries, we would have solved world hunger already. <br />Copyright 2002, Blue Jean Media, Inc.	2002-06-03
