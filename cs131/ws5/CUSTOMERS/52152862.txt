The overall message of this book is excellent. However, some of the specific claims in it are false, and in some cases outrageously so.<br />First the good. There is much debate in Christian circles as to why Christians get sick. Some claim it is due to a lack of faith. Others say it is God's will for the person to be sick, that He is \\"testing\\" the individual or developing character in them. And others say that it's not possible to know why a particular person got sick.<br />But Malkmus says that in most cases the cause has nothing to do with these \\"spiritual\\" reasons. The cause is simply physical. Christians get sick as a result of living unhealthy lifestyles. And all one has to do is observe what Christian eat when they get together to confirm this.<br />After just about every home Bible study I've been to junk food is served, and everyone except me partakes of it. And the waistlines of Christians reflect this. It seems that at most Bible studies I am about the only person there who is not significantly overweight. And most of these overweight Christians seem to have diabetes. But they seem unwilling to admit the connection between the two. And it is not just diabetes: heart disease, cancer, stroke, osteoporosis, and many other illnesses are diet-related.<br />Exercise is another important factor the Malkmus discusses, and rightly so. Lack of exercise also contributes to all of the above and many other illnesses. Malkmus also discusses the need for pure air, pure water, sunshine, adequate rest, and a positive mental attitude. And all of these are important as well, but most Christians again see little concerned with any of these.<br />But amidst this excellent and much needed message, the many false statements Malkmus makes detract from the value of this book. Also, his overuse of exclamations points is very distracting.<br />For instance, he writes, \\"Glucose is a naturally occurring sugar found in raw fruits, vegetables, and honey! Glucose is a complex sugar that is released very slowly into the blood stream. Glucose is the form in which God made sugar, and the form in which our all-wise Creator intended sugar to be consumed by the body!\\" (p.53).<br />There is glucose in the foods he mentions, but the main sugar in these foods is fructose (\\"fruit sugar\\"). Moreover, glucose is NOT a \\"complex sugar.\\" Glucose is a monosaccharide, meaning it is composed of one sugar molecule. This is the \\"simplest\\" form in which sugar occurs. Also, glucose is the highest sugar and just about the highest food found on the glycemic index, a measure of how quickly a food causes blood sugar levels to rise. Interestingly, fructose has the lowest glycemic rating of any sugar.<br />Meanwhile, Malkmus writes, \\"Sucrose, on the other hand, is a product of man! Sucrose is a physically and mentally addictive drug! Sucrose is a simple sugar that is released very quickly into the blood stream...causing great harm to the body!\\" (p.53; ellipse in original).<br />In fact, sucrose is naturally occurring, albeit highly processed, sugar. It's a disaccharide, composed of one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose. As such, its glycemic rating is halfway between these two sugars. So Malkmus has basically reversed the facts regarding glucose and sucrose.<br />One can get addicted to the \\"sugar rush\\" one gets from eating a lot of sugar, but it really is exaggerating to call sucrose a drug. As for how harmful it is, sugar contributes nothing of nutritive value except calories. And it is associated with various health problems, but there is still much debate over exactly how detrimental it is. But still, Malkmus's basic message is correct: don't eat much sugar. But it would help if he got his facts straight.<br />Examples of Malkmus's outrageous claims can been seen when promotes what he believes to be the ideal diet: a raw foods diet. He writes, \\"Living cells cannot be nourished with dead food! Life begets life! All cooked food is deadfood! The heat of cooking destroys all of the enzymes, over 80% of the vitamins, changes the protein to an unusable form, and the organic minerals revert back to their inorganic state!\\" (p.94).<br />Malkmus provides no specific documentation to back-up any of these claims. There is a list of 70 references in the back of the book. But the text itself contains no footnotes to any of these references, nor are page numbers for the references given.<br />But I did some research and could find no evidence whatsoever that cooking somehow causes the protein and minerals in food to convert into a form that is unusable by the body. Now it is true that cooking will cause some loss of vitamins, but how much of a loss depends on many factors. And unless you boil a cup of broccoli in a gallon of water for an hour, it won't be anywhere near 80%.<br />It is also true there is a loss of enzymes from cooking food. And for this reason it is wise to eat a portion of one's foods raw. However, in some cases nutrients are actually made more bioavailable by cooking. An example of this is the lycopene found in tomatoes.<br />It is also true that many will thrive on a raw foods diet, but many others will find such a diet way too restrictive and will have great difficulties trying to follow it. I won't pursue this issue here I discuss such concerns in detail in my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\"<br />It is a shame that there are such problems with this book since the overall message is excellent and much needed. So with some hesitancy, I would recommend this book. Just be leery of any specific claims. And for information on healthy eating that is not as restrictive as the raw foods diet Malkmus recommends see my \\"Creationist Diet\\" book.food!

And this cookbook provides both. For instance, I would have never thought of using chickpeas to make \\"tuna salad\\" or tofu to make \\"egg salad.\\"<br />The idea of \\"20 minutes to dinner\\" is appealing to busy people today. However, I have found that some of the recipes take longer than this to make. But some are worth the time. The recipe for \\"quick pizza dough\\" does take a little effort, but it is worth it to make a good tasting pizza that is made with whole wheat rather than white flour.<br />The introductory information in this book is helpful as well. It provides some general tips on vegan cooking and shopping. And I particularly like the recommendation to eat organic as much as possible. A recent study showed that there is a significant amount of pesticides residue on non-organic produce, far more than on organic produce.<br />As regards texturized vegetable protein (TVP), it is a very useful item for making \\"imitation\\" meats. However, it should be noted that one could be allergic to TVP while not being allergic to soy in general. There is \\"something\\" about the processing method that turns soybeans into soy flour and then into TVP that makes it even more of a potential allergen.<br />Overall, I would recommend this cookbook for ideas on how to follow a vegan diet. And for reasons why such a diet is healthy, see my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\"	2002-05-30

I found TVP to be ideal for making imitation meat products, and this cookbook was an excellent resource for finding ways to use TVP. And some of the TVP foods I found to be better tasting than their meat counter-parts!<br />Probably the best tasting recipe I made from this book was the \\"Herbed Loaf.\\" Also excellent was the recipe for \\"Sloppy Joes.\\" And I made up a large bath of the \\"Veggie Burgers\\" and froze most of them for quick sandwiches later.<br />However, after a few months I found that I wasn't \\"thriving\\" on the vegan diet. And one reason I didn't was I would later learn that I was allergic to TVP! Since I was eating TVP almost every day, this had significant health implications.<br />But it should be noted that I am not allergic to soy in general. And I have since found out that many people have a problem with TVP who don't have a problem with soy otherwise. So there is \\"something\\" about the processing method that turns soybeans into soy flour and then into TVP that makes it even more of a potential allergen.<br />As a result of this problem, I eventually stopped the vegan diet and went back to eating a still a mostly plant-based diet, but with some animal foods. Maybe if I hadn't been eating all of the TVP I would not have had problems with the vegan diet as I do believe that a vegan diet can be healthy. I even have a chapter on \\"The Benefits of a Vegan Diet\\" in my book \\"Creationist Diet.\\"<br />But all of that said, if you don't have a problem with TVP, then this cookbook would be of great benefit. But I would be careful about eating too much TVP until you're sure it's not a problem for you.	2002-05-30

The recipes simply are not that appealing. I've made a few of the beans recipes, but that's about it. I've found other vegan cookbooks to be more helpful, such as \\"Simply Vegan\\" and \\"20 Minutes to Dinner.\\"<br />So if I ever publish a new edition of my \\"Creationist Diet\\" book, I'll probably omit the recommendation for this cookbook and substitute both of these other ones.	2002-05-30

As the name implies, the recipes are simple and quick to prepare. Recipes are the ones for \\"Hummus\\" and \\"Saut&eacute;ed Collards and tomatoes\\" are easy to prepare, great tasting, and very healthy as well.<br />But it should be noted that only about half of this book contains recipes. The second half provides information that will be of help to vegans. There's first a description of different kind of vegan foods. This can be helpful or people who don't know what \\"bok choy\\" or okra\\" are.<br />The rest of this section provides information on \\"Vegan Nutrition.\\" For long-time vegans, this information would probably be familiar, but it can be of great help to those just starting a vegan diet. And most of the information is good. However, some mention should be made about the differences between different types of fat.<br />It is only the saturated fat found mainly in animal foods that are a health concern. And, of course, vegans don't have to be concerned about this. The main sources of saturated in a vegan diet would be coconut and palm oils. Otherwise, the monounsaturated fats in foods like olive oil and nuts and seeds are very beneficial.<br />Rather than lumping together all fats and recommending a low-fat diet, I would say a better diet would be one low in saturated fats but moderate in monounsaturated fats. And I discuss the benefits of eating such a diet in my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods according to the Bible.\\"	2002-05-30

The Ultimate Program For Eating Well, Feeling Great, And Living Longer	Books	4	12	20	N	N	Very good premise and advice	The premise and advice in the book for the most part are very sound. Colbert concludes from the Biblical and scientific evidence that is good to eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish, and less saturated and hydrogenated fats, red meat, sweets, and processed and refined foods. He also correctly notes that there are sound health reasons to follow the OT guidelines of \\"clean\\" vs. \\"unclean\\" meats.<br />However, Colbert could have been a little clearer that diet is a health not a spiritual issue. Paul makes this abundantly clear when he says, \\"But food does not present [or, commend] us to God, for neither if we eat do we excel [or, are better off]; nor if we do not eat do we fall short [or, are inferior]\\" (1Cor 8:8; ALT).<br />But at the same time, Paul said, \\"All [things] are lawful for me, _but_ all [things] are not advantageous [or, beneficial]. All [things] are lawful for me, _but_ all [things] do not build up [fig., edify]\\" (1Cor 10:23; ALT). So even if it is not a sin to eat \\"unclean\\" meats or junk food it may not be \\"beneficial\\" to do so.<br />Colbert is correct in noting that Jesus was not a vegetarian, as some activists have tried to claim. He correctly points out that fish was eaten by Jesus and is a very healthy food. But it should also be noted that there are vegetarian sources of the healthy fatty acids found in fish. Colbert mentions olive oil, but flax seeds, walnuts, and other nuts and seeds are also very good sources of these healthy fats.<br />Colbert is also correct in discussing the importance of exercise. It drives me crazy when Christians try to justify not exercising by quoting 1Timothy 4:8, \\"For bodily exercise is beneficial for a few [things], but godliness is beneficial for all [things], having promise of the present life and of the coming [life]\\" (ALT). True, Jesus did not follow some kind of \\"aerobics workout,\\" but He didn't need to. As Colbert notes, the amount of walking that He did was more than enough exercise.<br />I also like Colbert's emphasis that what he is advocating is not a diet program but a lifestyle change. \\"Going on a diet\\" simply doesn't work. What is important is to focus one eating healthy foods and being active. Health benefits and even weight loss will naturally follow.<br />However, Colbert is a little too strong in recommending a \\"low-fat\\" diet. As indicated above, some fatty foods are in fact very healthy. And if one tries to keep the percentage of fat too low in their diets they won't be able to eat sufficient amounts of these healthy fatty foods to attain the health benefits.<br />Also, there are people who fare better on higher protein, higher fat diets. However, even in such cases I do believe it is best to stick to eating \\"healthy\\" foods. One can alter the proportions of protein, fats, and carbs in ones diet by eating different proportions of such foods.<br />As for what are healthy vs. unhealthy foods, Colbert, of course, discuss this in his book, and it is the point of my similar book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and \\"God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\"<br />In my book I don't focus on what Jesus ate per se, although that is mentioned. I focus more on the early chapters of Genesis, hence the title and somewhat different conclusions than Colbert comes to.

If I had read Weil's book while I was still working on my book I probably would have used several quotes from Weil's book in mine as our ideas on food, diet, and nutrition parallel greatly.<br />Weil's begins his book by looking in detail at the three macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins). He concludes that low carb are faulty in recommending the reduction or elimination of all carbs. Weil correctly notes that the complaints low-carbers raise against carbs actually only apply to high-glycemic carbs (i.e. carbs that quickly raise the blood sugar).<br />He then states that carb foods in their more natural and traditional states have much lower glycemic responses than more recent foods (like stone ground whole wheat bread vs. refined white flour bread). And one of the main points of my book is that foods should be eaten in as natural a state as possible. So whole wheat is to be preferred to processed white flour.<br />Weil then notes that as with carbs not all fats are \\"bad.\\" Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and their associated omega-3 fatty acids are actually very healthy. Foods sources of such fats are fish, nuts and seeds, olive oil, and avocadoes. And in my book I present studies that show that diets high in MUFAs reduce heart disease risk more than traditional low fat diets.<br /><br />In regards to protein, Weil presents some very sound recommendations. Included among these is to substitute vegetable protein (from soy, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds) for some of the animal protein in ones diet, to eat animals foods only from organically raised or game animals, to avoid cured meats (like bacon and lunch meats), and to avoid shellfish (due to their high contamination rates).  I make all of these suggestions in my book.<br />Weil then concludes this section by recommending the following split of the macronutrients: 50-60% carbs, 10-20% protein, 30% fat (mostly from MUFAs). I give very similar recommendations in my book, through with somewhat larger ranges. So both Weil and I disagree with both very low carb and very low fat diets and recommend more moderate percentages.<br />Weil states that he consumes a lacto-pesco-vegetarian diet. This means he eats dairy products and fish but no other animal foods. The fish part is in line with Weil's recommendation for the consumption of MUFAs. And Weil puts some qualifications on the dairy part. He states, \\"I eat modest amounts of dairy products, mostly cheeses\\" (p.133). Weil discussed some of the problems with heavy dairy consumption and correctly notes that one does not need to consume dairy to attain sufficient calcium. There are plenty of non-dairy sources of calcium available.<br />Given the controversy there is surrounding dairy (with the dairy industry saying it is an necessary food and the anti-milk crowd saying it is a horrid food), I spend three chapters on the subject of dairy in my book. And my conclusion is similar to Weil's: if you consume dairy it should only be in limited amounts.<br />Weil then surveys different proposed diets to find \\"the best diet in the world.\\" He looks at the Paleolithic diet, raw foods diet, traditional Japanese diet, Asian diet, vegan diet, Mediterranean diet, and the USDA food pyramid. He discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each of these diets.<br />I discuss several of these diets in my book as well. In fact, it was the Paleolithic diet (which is based on the theory of evolution) that got me thinking as to what a diet based on the theory of creation would look like, and hence was the impetus for my book.<br />Weil then discusses the problems of rampant obesity in the United States and presents suggestions on weight loss. And all of his suggestions are very sound. First among them is that calories count. To lose weight one must reduce caloric intake and increase expenditure. This means eating less and exercising more. But he emphasizes that doing so one should not follow \\"fad\\" diets or drastically change the proportion of carbs, protein, and fats in ones diet.<br />Rather than follow some fad diet, Weil recommends, \\"you need to change long-term patterns of eating and physical activity\\" (p.185). What is needed is to follow the same recommendations for healthy eating that he presents throughout his book but to adjust the amount of calories consumed and to add exercise to ones daily life. I make the same recommendations in my book.<br />Weil then gives some recommendations on \\"buying food and eating out.\\" He recommends the reading of labels to avoid the consumption of unnatural ingredients like hydrogenation oils, artificial colorings, artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and nitrates. Given the emphasis of my book on eating foods in their most natural states, I wholeheartedly agree with these recommendations and make the same recommendation in my book.<br />Weil concludes his book with a section of recipes. This is one place where Weil's book and mine differs as I don't have such a section in my book. But I do recommend a couple of cookbooks that I have found helpful.<br />Another way in which my book differs from Weil's is that along with citing numerous scientific studies supporting various dietary recommendations, my book is also filled with Biblical references. In fact, the full title of my book is \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\" But given the parallels between our books, this shows that whether one looks to the Bible or scientific studies similar conclusions will be drawn in how to go about \\"eating well for optimum health.\\"<br />And given how much Weil's book parallels mine, I can't help but give his book five stars. I would highly recommend it. And my book would provide further details and reinforcement on the appropriateness of Weil's recommendations.so one should not follow \\"fad\\" diets or drastically change the proportion of carbs, protein, and fats in ones diet.<br />Rather than follow some fad diet, Weil recommends, \\"you need to change long-term patterns of eating and physical activity\\" (p.185).

US	52152862	REP0PNOJQ4VUM	0915811812	381791390	Diet for a New America	Books	3	31	49	N	Y	Out-dated info and ignores organic meat, but otherwise good	I was rather disappointed when I received this book. I thought that it was an updated edition. But the only new information in this book is a six-page \\"Afterword,\\" which was apparently written in the late 1990s (The last date mentioned in it is 1997). The copyright for the rest of the book is 1987. And looking over the footnotes appendix, the bulk of Robbins' sources are dated from the 1970s through the early 1980s. I am writing this review in 2002, so the information in this book is already 20-30 years old. Given how quickly our knowledge of nutrition and related issues grows and changes, this leaves the statistics and many of Robbins' claims rather out-dated.<br />That said, this book is a 400+ page treatise designed to convince everyone to become a vegetarian. And I am sure many have done so as a result of reading this book. The details about the mistreatment of farm animals alone are enough to turn a sensitive person away from eating animals.<br />And for those concerned about their health, this book details how pesticides concentrate in the meat and fat of animals. And it presents stories of the health problems caused by the hormones given to animals. For instance, Robbins tells the stories of very young girls developing fully formed breasts as a result of eating hormone-containing meat. These facts alone do show that there is serious health risks associated with the eating of today's meat.<br />And Robbins cites studies showing the correspondence between meat eating and the development of cancer and heart disease. But this is where the problem with Robbins sources being so dated comes in. When I did the research for my more recent book \\"Creationist Diet,\\" I found that the evidence was split as to whether meat eating was associated with an increased risk of cancer or not.<br />But overall, I would say that Robbins makes a strong case for not eating meat as it is commonly produced today. And in that respect this is a valuable book. There are serious problems associated with the consumption of most of today's meat.<br />However, in his zeal to promote vegetarianism, he tries to write off the eating of organic meat with one paragraph (on page 343). But his main argument against eating organically raised meat is that such animals would still concentrate toxins from the grains they eat.<br />Now maybe back in 1987 someone could label meat from animals that had been fed pesticide-laden grains \\"organic,\\" but that is no longer the case today. There are now regulations on the use of the term \\"organic,\\" and more stringent ones will be coming into effect later this year.<br />Moreover, by definition, organically raised animals are not given hormones. And pasture-fed animals would not be subjected to the mistreatment of factory farm animals that Robbins describes in his book.<br />In addition, I am now of the concerted opinion that when studies do show there are health problems associated with the eating of meat, it is not meat per se that is causing the problems but the pesticides, hormones, antibiotics, and steroids in the meat, along with the high amounts of saturated fat in such animals. But such problems would not apply to organic meat or game meat.<br />So Robbins' arguments in regards to the mistreatment of animals, contaminates in animals, and the health effects of meat eating would not apply to organically raised, pasture-fed animals. Similarly, his arguments would not apply to the eating of game animals. So if one can find organically raised, pasture fed animals or utilize game meat, then the bulk of the arguments in this book would not apply. The only argument left is Robbins' contention that farm animals are \\"intelligent\\" creatures, and thus it is morally wrong to eat them.<br />Now the discussion of morals becomes much less concrete. And each person must decide for himself or herself if it is morally wrong to kill and eat animals. But personally, as a Christian, I look to the Bible for guidance on what is morally right or wrong. And the Bible makes it clear that the killing of animals for food is not morally wrong. I address this issue in detail in my book.<br />Having said all of that, I do believe that a mostly plant-based diet is healthiest. The consumption of healthy plant foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and legumes are definitely associated with decreased risk of heart disease, cancer and stroke. And eating a majority of ones daily food in the form of animal foods would displace these more healthy foods from ones diet.<br />It also should be said that a vegetarian diet can be healthy. In fact, I have a chapter in my book on \\"The Benefits of a Vegan Diet.\\" But I also have a chapter on \\"The Pros and Cons of Flesh Foods.\\" And in that chapter I demonstrate that it simply is not a clear-cut case that the eating of meat is bad and the not eating of meat is good as Robbins makes it out to be.<br />As for myself, I have followed a vegan diet in the past. In fact, I was following such a diet when I wrote my book. But I found that I did not \\"thrive' on it. But the re-inclusion of a limited amount of animal foods has benefited me greatly. So my diet is now probably about 80-90% plant foods and remainder from organic animal foods.<br />I discuss all of the issues I address above in much more detail in my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\" And it should be noted that my book was published in September of 2000.

And the Bible makes it clear that the killing of animals for food is not morally wrong. I address this issue in detail in my book. <br />Having said all of that, I do believe that a mostly plant-based diet is healthiest. The consumption of healthy plant foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and legumes are definitely associated with decreased risk of heart disease, cancer and stroke. And eating a majority of ones daily food in the form of animal foods would displace these more healthy foods from ones diet.<br />It also should be said that a vegetarian diet can be healthy. In fact, I have a chapter in my book on \\"The Benefits of a Vegan Diet.\\" But I also have a chapter on \\"The Pros and Cons of Flesh Foods.\\" And in that chapter I demonstrate that it simply is not a clear-cut case that the eating of meat is bad and the not eating of meat is good as Robbins makes it out to be.<br />As for myself, I have followed a vegan diet in the past. In fact, I was following such a diet when I wrote my book. But I found that I did not \\"thrive' on it. But the re-inclusion of a limited amount of animal foods has benefited me greatly. So my diet is now probably about 80-90% plant foods and remainder from organic animal foods.<br />I discuss all of the issues I address above in much more detail in my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\" And it should be noted that my book was published in September of 2000. And the sources I cite are from the 1900s and even some from early 2000. So my book provides much more recent information on all of these issues than Robbins' book does.	2002-04-04

Neither of these exactly describe what we are doing, since we have borrowed ideas from both, but I suppose that we are closer to formal equivalence than dynamic equivalence.&quot;<br />Dynamic equivalence refers to the thought for thought translation principle used in such versions as the NIV and NLT. This method is less literal than the formal equivalence (word for word) method seen in such versions as the KJV and NKJV. And in my opinion, formal equivalence is a much better principle for translating the Bible.<br />In any case, the above is a rather accurate description of the translation method of the WEB. It is mostly a formal equivalence version, but it tends towards dynamic equivalence at places. Also added words are not italicized or bracketed as they are in versions like the KJV and NKJV. So its accuracy is somewhat less than these two versions but much better than true dynamic equivalence versions. And with only minor deviations into dynamic equivalency, the WEB is reliable Bible version. Moreover, the WEB is much more readable than the KJV and somewhat more readable than NKJV.<br />In addition, the WEB differs from the KJV and NKJV in that it is based on the Majority Text (MT) rather than the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; (TR). These two texts are very similar, much closer to each other than either is to the more popular Critical Text (CT). Of these three texts, I believe the MT is the most accurate, so being based on this text a big plus in favor of the WEB.<br />In fact, the WEB is one of only two versions currently available based on the MT. The other is my own &quot;Analytical-Literal Translation&quot; (ALT). But, as the name implies, my ALT differs from the WEB in that the ALT is a very literal translation, thus it is more accurate than the WEB. But the WEB would be more readable.<br />The WEB also has footnotes indicating textual variants, along with alternative translations and explanatory notes. My ALT includes such information. It has alternative translations and other aids within brackets within the text and a list significant textual variants in an appendix. And whether in footnotes, within brackets, or in an appendix, such info can be very helpful in Bible study.<br />So the WEB provides an accurate and readable translation of the best available Greek text, while providing helpful aids for Bible study. So I would highly recommend it. And for an even more accurate translation of the MT, see my ALT.<br />For further details on these two versions, an extensive discussion on the three different Greek texts mentioned above, along with reviews of about 30 other versions of the Bible, see my book &quot;Differences Between Bible Versions.&quot;WEB would be more readable.<br />The WEB also has footnotes indicating textual variants, along with alternative translations and explanatory notes.

It is an updating of the &quot;King James Version.&quot; Jay P. Green, the translator of the &quot;Literal Translation of the Bible&quot; (LITV), also translated the MKJV. The press release for the MKJV says, &quot;... it is the grand old version in the English of today-period!&quot;<br />It is true that the MKJV updates the archaic language of the KJV, but the MKJV does make other changes as well. However, these changes tend towards making the text more literal than the KJV, and the MKJV is easier to read than the KJV. So as compared to the KJV, it is an improvement. But as compared to the &quot;New King James Version,&quot; I'm not so sure.<br />I have been using the NKJV as my primary Bible for years. The MKJV is somewhat more accurate than the NKJV. But the difference is not that great. And the MKJV is also somewhat more difficult to read. So I see no reason to switch to it. So I will probably stick with my practice of using the NKJV as my primary Bible and Green's LITV as my secondary Bible.<br />But having said that, the MKJV is a very good Bible version. It is very accurate and is based on what I believe to be a very good Greek text, the &quot;Textus Receptus.&quot; So the NMKJV is very reliable and is worth checking out.<br /><br />I discuss the versions mentioned above in much more detail, along with about 30 other versions of the Bible, in my book &quot;Differences Between Bible Versions.&quot;	2002-03-31

This principle simply believes that EVERY SINGLE WORD in the original Hebrew and Greek texts should be translated. In addition, the grammatical forms of words should also be translated as they are in the original texts. So a noun should be translated as a noun, an adjective as an adjective, etc. Moreover, any words added for clarity should be offset in some way, usually by placing them in italics or brackets.<br />So a literal translation principle produces a very exact reproduction of what God originally said. And I do believe that this method of translating is the only one which concurs completely with the doctrine of verbal inspiration, i.e. the belief that not just the thoughts or ideas of the Bible are inspired, but the very words and grammatical forms of words themselves. It is for this reason that I have been using the LITV (for \\"Literal Version\\") extensively for the past 15 years. It is the ideal type for Bible to use for in-depth, personal Bible study.<br />If fact, I am so much in favor of a literal translation method that I produced my own literal translation of the New Testament, the \\"Analytical-Literal Translation\\" (ALT). But there are two main differences between my ALT and the LITV. First, the LITV is based on the Textus Receptus (TR) while my ALT is based on the Majority Text (MT). These two texts are very similar, much closer to each other than either is to the more popular Critical Text (CT), but there are some significant differences between them. And I favor the MT to the TR, but either of these to the CT.<br />Second, my ALT has \\"analytical\\" features included within brackets within the text to help the reader better understand the text.<br />I produced my own translation not because I thought there were any problems with the LITV. It is truly an excellent translation. But I wanted a translation with these two features that the LITV lacks.<br />Now an argument often made against using a literal translation method is that it would be too awkward to read. And yes, the LITV can seem a bit awkward when one first begins reading it, especially if one is used to reading a much less literal version like the NIV. But personally, I never found the LITV to be excessively awkward. And one of the comments I have received about my ALT is that it is surprisingly easy to read. This is probably because the analytical features help to explain difficult passages.<br />So I wholeheartedly recommend the LITV. Even if it takes a little getting used to, the effort will be worth it. It will enhance your Bible studies significantly. It is truly an extremely reliable and accurate Bible version. And if you want another literal translation to compare it to, I would recommend my ALT. And for further details on these two versions, along with additional information on different translation methods and Greek text-types and reviews of about 30 other versions of the Bible, see my book Differences Between Bible Versions.ow an argument often made against using a literal translation method is that it would be too awkward to read.

But IMO, it does not update the KJV enough. For example, consider the following question and statement by Jesus, \\"Why make ye this ado and weep? The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth\\" (5:39) This is English; but not the kind of English that I speak. The only time I have ever used the word \\"ado\\" is in the Shakespearean phrase, \\"Much ado about nothin'.\\" And I have heard of \\"a damsel in distress\\" but a damsel that sleepeth?<br />For comparison, the New King James Version (NKJV) renders this passages, \\"Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping.\\"<br />Moreover, the KJ21 is not consistent in updating words that have changed meaning. And it does not seem to update some of the inaccuracies of the KJV.<br />For example, Mark 1:34 reads in the KJ21, \\"And He healed many who were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and He suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew Him.\\"<br />Compare the NKJV rendering, \\"Then He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.\\"<br />Note the use of the word \\"suffered\\" in the KJ21. Today, \\"suffer\\" means to experience pain. So the NKJV has \\"allow\\" here, which fits the context much better. Note also the word \\"divers.\\" The only time I have ever used this word is in reference to people who jump headfirst into water. The NKJV's \\"various\\" is much more understandable.<br />Lastly, note the word \\"devils\\" in the KJ21. The Greek word is \\"daimonia\\" and is better rendered \\"demons\\" as it is in the NKJV. The Greek word for \\"devil\\" is \\"diabalos\\" (Matt 4:1). There are many demons, but only one devil (\\"diablos\\" is always singular in Scripture when referring to the devil).<br />So the KJ21 seems not to have changed the wording of the KJV when it would have been prudent to do so. However, I am pleased that the KJ21 did not change a couple of aspects of the KJV. First off, the KJ21 appears to be based on the Textus Receptus that the KJV is based on. I believe this Greek text is truer to the original manuscripts than the \\"Critical Text\\" that other most modern-day translations use.<br />Also, the KJ21 follows the same \\"formal equivalence\\" (word for word) translation principle of the KJV. This principle differs from the \\"dynamic equivalence\\" (thought for thought) theory that most other modern-day versions use. I much prefer the \\"formal equivalence\\" principle. However, the above two points are also true for the NKJV.<br />So my impression of the KJ21 is not very good. If you are going to \\"update\\" the KJV, then update the KJV. But the KJ21 seems to only go part of the way; it updates some of the language but leaves much, well, \\"dated.\\"<br />This conclusion is especially pointed as there are alternatives. In addition to the NKJV, the \\"Modern King James Version\\" and \\"The Literal Translation of the Bible\\" provide formal equivalence or literal translations of the Textus Receptus, but do so using modern-day English. And my own \\"Analytical-Literal Translation\\" provides a literal translation of the Majority Text, which is very similar to the Textus Receptus.<br />For a detailed discussion of the different translation principles and Greek text-types mentioned above, see my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions.\\" My book also reviews the other versions mentioned above, along with many other Bible versions.to be based on the Textus Receptus that the KJV is based on.

But there are potential problems with this method. I will use a well-known passage (Ephesians 2:8,9) to demonstrate such problems. The verses will be quoted first from the more literal New King James Version, then from God's Word:<br />\\"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.\\"<br />\\"God saved you through faith as an act of kindness. You had nothing to do with it. Being saved is a gift from God. It is not the result of anything you have done, so no one can boast.\\"<br />It should be obvious that these two versions differ greatly. If nothing else, God's word is considerably longer, having 39 words versus the NKJV's 27. But the important question is: are these added words justified by the Greek text? A look at some of the more important changes will answer this question.<br />First, the conjunction \\"For\\" has been omitted in God's Word. But this word is important as it indicates that this verse is related to the preceding one. The problem here is, by omitting this and other conjunctions, God's Word makes it much easier for people to take verses out of context.

Moreover, it must be asked why \\"grace\\" needed to be changed? Is it really a word that people today would not understand?<br />Fourth, \\"and that not of yourselves\\" has been changed to \\"You had nothing to do with it.\\" Now it is true that the latter is a more natural way of expressing the concept, but none of the words are accurate translations of anything in the Greek text. Moreover, a phrase has been changed to a full sentence.<br />But most importantly, the word \\"that\\" has been changed to \\"it.\\" So a demonstrative pronoun has been replaced with a personal pronoun. But at least God's Word is still using a pronoun. This pronoun is important as it refers back to \\"something\\" in the verse, but there is much debate as to what that something is. However, the two versions differ as to whether they make a decision for their readers as to what the antecedent to the pronoun is. This can been seen in the next words.<br />The NKJV begins the next phrase with \\"it is\\" in italics. The italics indicate these words are added. But God's Word adds, \\"Being saved is\\" without indicating the words are added. The Greek text actually has simply \\"this.\\" So neither version is really literal here. But the NKJV is closer in using a pronoun to render a pronoun rather than God's Word's use of a participle functioning as a noun.<br />The difference here is this: the NKJV leaves it vague as to exactly what \\"that\\" refers to, and hence what the \\"gift from God\\" is. Many believe \\"that\\" and \\"the gift\\" refer back to the verb \\"saved.\\" But others believe they refer to the noun \\"faith\\" or the entire preceding sentence, which includes faith, along with grace and salvation.<br />This difference is important as this verse could help to answer a very important yet very debated question: Do people generate faith from their own \\"free wills\\", or is the very ability to have faith a gift from God? If the antecedent to \\"that\\" is\\"faith\\" then the latter would be true. Faith itself would be a gift from God.

And doing so can produce an accurate and readable version. But what Peterson does is re-write the New Testament so that it expresses its ideas in the manner in which he thinks these ideas would have been expressed if the New Testament were written today. To do this requires completing ignoring all details of the Greek text and simply re-writing the Bible. And by doing so, there is the very real possibility that ideas foreign to the Bible will be inserted into it.<br />One of the worst examples of this problem occurring is in Acts 1:20: The Message has \\"It's exactly what we find written in the Psalms: 'Let his farm become haunted so no one can live there.'\\" Meanwhile, the more literal NKJV has, \\"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it'.'\\"<br />First, The Message states that Judas owned a \\"farm,\\" thus indicating that he was a farmer. But the Greek word here simply means, \\"dwelling place\\" as the NKJV has it. And there is no indication elsewhere in the Scriptures as to what Judas' occupation was. So the idea of Judas being a farmer has been inserted into the text. But that's not the worst unbiblical idea in this sentence. That comes with the word \\"haunted.\\"<br />The word haunted means, \\"inhabited or frequented by ghosts: a haunted castle\\" (Webster's). So it would seem in Peterson's world there are ghosts haunting the homes of people who die tragic deaths. It is true this is popular mythology, but it is just that, mythology. In the Bible and thus in the real world, there is no such thing as ghosts!<br />This is very important. There are many people today who believe in such things as ghost, and even live in constant fear as a result. But becoming a Christian and believing Biblical teachings should deliver a person from such superstitions. However, the Message would not be able to deliver such a person, but would probably help to confirm them in their superstitious and fearful ways.<br />So the Message is a very readable and expressive book. However, the Message completely ignores the original words and grammar of the text and instead re-writes the Bible. In doing so, it inserts ideas that are foreign to the actual Word of God. As such, the Message is not a book one could relay on for help in understanding the Word of God.<br />The above was adapted from my book Differences Between Bible Versions.

And when does, it will either be because the NIV is not translating words found in the Hebrew and Greek texts, or the NIV is adding words not found in the original texts. And even worse, these added words are not offset from the original God-inspired words by being placed in italics like the NASB and KJV do.<br />A simple example of the former can be seen in Joshua 1:8. In this verse, the NASB has 50 words while the KJV has 48 words, but the NIV only has 30 words. You don't need to be a Hebrew scholar to figure out that the NIV has left out quite a bit here!

US	52152862	R102DFLVUQ33S3	0310903335	12858635	Comparative Study Bible, Revised	Books	2	47	70	N	N	Four problematic versions	I first purchased the Comparative Study Bible (CSB) shortly after I became a Christian in the mid-1980s. I utilized it extensively over the next few years. I thought it was great to be able to compare four different Bible versions at a glance. In my Bible studies, I also would utilize J.P. Green's Hebrew-Greek English Interlinear Bible.<br />In my studies I would compare the four versions in the CSB to the word-for-word interlinear translation in the interlinear, along with the marginal translation, Green's own Literal Translation of the Bible. Also at this time I began studying the issue of Bible versions, including translation principles and Greek text types. As a result of these studies and research, I became convinced that there were serious problems with each of the four versions in the CSB.<br />First in the CSB is the New American Standard Bible (NASB). Now the edition I had utilized the 1977 edition of the NASB (the NAS77), but more recent editions have the 1995 updated edition (NAS95). But whichever edition is used, as I compared the NASB with the other translation in the CSB and with the interlinear, it became obvious that the NASB was a fairly literal and accurate translation.<br /><br />However, there were times that the NASB differed significantly from the interlinear and even from the also fairly literal King James Version (KJV), which is also contained in the CSB. As I would learn, the reason for this difference was that the NASB is based on a \\"Critical Text\\" (CT) type of Greek text while the interlinear and the KJV used the Textus Receptus (TR). And my studies convinced me that the TR was to be preferred to the CT, and slightly better than the TR was the more recent Majority Text (MT). So despite its literal accuracy, the NASB had a serious defect in being based on a less reliable Greek text.<br />Next in the CSB is the New International Version (NIV). This version is also based on the CT, so it has this defect. But even more serious is the translation principle. The NIV utilizes a thought for thought principle rather than the more literal word-for-word principle of the NASB or KJV.<br />When I would compare the NIV to these versions or to the interlinear, it would very often differ significantly. And when it did, it was would either be because the NIV was not translating words found in the Hebrew and Greek texts, or the NIV was adding words that were not found in the original texts. And even worse, these added words were not offset from the original God-inspired words by being placed in italics like the NASB or KJV did.<br />A simple example of the former can be seen in Joshua 1:8. In this verse, the NAS95 has 50 words while the KJV has 48 words, but the NIV only has 30 words. You don't need to be a Hebrew scholar to figure out that the NIV has left out quite a bit here! And a simple example of added words not being indicated can be seen in 1Cor 7:9. The NIV adds the words \\"with passion\\" at the end of this verse without any indication it has done so. Altogether, there are probably thousand of added and omitted words in the NIV. To me, this indicates serious problems with the NIV.<br />Next in the CSB is the KJV. As already indicated, it is a fairly literal translation, and it is based on the TR. So it is a very reliable Bible version. However, given its use of the Elizabethan English, the KJV can be a very difficult Bible version to read. For comparing an occasionally verse this is not a major problem, but I found it to be too awkward for extended reading.<br />Lastly in the CSB is the Amplified Bible. As with the NASB and NIV, it is based on the CT. So this is one problem with it. But more serious is its rather unique translation principle. It claims to express \\"nuances\\" of the original Hebrew and Greek texts.<br />Now this idea does sound noble. There are many nuances of especially the Greek text that do not translate very easily into English. However, in trying to be so expressive, the Amplified can be evenmore awkward to read than the KJV. The extreme \\"amplification\\" of the word \\"blessed\\" in the Beatitudes demonstrates this problem. Each Beatitude begins, &quot;Blessed-happy, to be envied, and spiritually prosperous [that is, with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation regardless of their outward circumstances]....&quot;<br />But even more importantly, upon investigation, I found that many of the Amplified Bible's \\"amplifications\\" were rather questionable. For instance, in Hebrews 1:4 in the Amplified, Jesus is said to have inherited &quot;the glorious Name (title).&quot; But Jesus' &quot;glorious Name&quot; is more likely merely a reference to His nature not just His title (see John 17:5). &quot;Name&quot; in Scripture often has this wider meaning.<br />So my studies showed me that the NASB, NIV, and Amplified were based on a less reliable Greek text. The translation principles of the NIV and the Amplified had serious problems with them, and the KJV was a difficult version to read. With these problems, and given how bulky it was to handle, I just didn't feel the CSB was worth the hassle of using any more. So I eventually donated it to my local church.<br />But I will say that the CSB does have some value. If one is still investigating the issue of Bible versions, the CSB will give you a way to quickly compare four rather different versions. So for this use only would I recommend the CSB.<br />And to aid you in studying the subject of Bible versions, I would also kindly suggest my book Differences Between Bible Versions. It contains much more in-depth reviews of each of the versions mentioned above. It also discusses the important issues of translation principles and Greek texts types at length.re awkward to read than the KJV.

And with this sentiment this writer gives a wholehearted \\"Amen.\\" But, unfortunately, when the subject of the need for the Holy Sprit comes up today Christians in more traditional churches back off due to being afraid that the excesses seen in charismatic circles is what is being promoted. But Cymbala manages to promote the need for the Holy Sprit but at the same time rebukes charismatics for their excesses.<br />He writes, \\"While some churches such as I have been describing might be referred to as cemeteries ... others on the other side of the spectrum are more like asylums. We have some horrendous abuses going on in the name of the Sprit of God. Many in the so-called charismatic movement have done bizarre things that are not only outside New Testament teaching but actually contradict it\\" (pp. 26,26, ellipse in original).<br />But the need for the power of the Spirit in the lives of all Christians is illustrated by Cymbala when he discuss how there seems to be little different between the behavior of Christians and non-Christians today. For instance, the rate of divorce among Christians is actually higher than among non-Christians! (p.22). Cymbala also discusses how the Church seems to be having little impact on the surrounding culture.  But he doesn't just decry such problems but presents examples of how things can change.<br />Cymbala himself is the pastor of a large church. And he relates many stories of people whose lives were changed by the power of the Holy Spirit operating in his church. But he isn't promoting just his church but relates how people have been changed by the Spirit outside of his church as well.<br />One of the most amazing stories he tells is in regards to \\"the Son of Sam\\"-the infamous serial killer in New York City in the late 1970's. His real name is David Berkowitz. He tells the story of Berkowitz's childhood and how he grew up to be the hated-filled killer that he was. But then Berkowitz was converted by the Holy Spirit and is now serving God in prison.<br />Such changes in a person require more than just the initial experience of salvation. As Cymbala writes, \\"Just as forgiveness can ONLY come through Christ's work on Calvary, daily living for the Lord can ONLY be done through the Spirit\\" (p.159, emphasis in original).<br />Overall, this is a very good book. The stories of changed lives are very encouraging and are worth the price of the book itself. But most of all, the overall message of the need for more of the Sprit in the Church at large and in the lives of each and every Christian is much needed today.<br />The one deficiency in this book is the use of the NIV for most of the Scripture quotations. As I relate in detail in my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions,\\" the NIV is not a very reliable version of the Bible. So I would suggest when reading Cymbala's book to have a more reliable version like the KJV or NKJV on hand to compare Scripture quotations.<br />But with that one caveat, I would highly recommend \\"Fresh Power.\\"lled killer that he was.

US	52152862	RBBFB4KNA66S	0830813780	911265612	Yearning: Living Between How It Is & How It Ought to Be	Books	3	40	43	N	N	You�ll either love or hate this book	I've been having a lot of problems of late. So my pastor gave me this book to read. When he did, he said that some people he had given it to loved it while others hated it. And I can understand why there is such a diverse reaction to it.<br />Basically, I can sum up this book in two sentences:<br />1. God never promised you a rose garden.<br />2. What God has promised you is Himself.<br />More specifically, it is Barnes thesis the God has never promised that those who trust in Him will have happy, fulfilled lives. He does not promise that things will go well with you. He does not promise that your health will remain good, that your finances will not fail, that if you're single you won't be lonely, that if you're married, your marriage will not fail, or that He will protect you from any of the other myriad of things that can go wrong in life. Problems will come to the Christian just as they do to the non-Christian.<br />What makes this book particularly discouraging is that Martin is saying that when things go wrong you cannot trust God that \\"things will work out.\\" They just might not work out. Things might just keep getting worse. So Martin completely disagrees with the \\"health and wealth gospel\\" that is preached by many.<br />Even more, Martin disagrees with the \\"self-fulfillment gospel\\" that is also often preached. As the Gospel is presented today, it often is given as a way for people to find meaning, purpose, or fulfillment in life. But Martin says that this is a misconstruing of the Gospel. In this fallen world, a lack of fulfillment is \\"normal,\\" and becoming a Christian is not going to change this.<br />As the back cover of the book states, \\"In this book, Barnes suggests we weren't created to be whole or complete. With a fresh reading of the early chapters of Genesis, he says that much of our pain and disillusionment arises from wrong expectations of the gospel and of life.\\"<br />However, Martin states that when we suffer, God Himself is our only \\"hope.\\" In fact, it is only when we are suffering that we can really experience God's grace. Quoting again from the back cover, \\"[Martin] helps us see how our needs and limitations are gifts, the best opportunities we have to receive God's grace.\\"<br />Some quotes from the book will help to bring this idea out:<br />&quot;Our hope is ultimately rooted in God, not in what he can do for us&quot; (p.131).<br />&quot;Our saving hope is not that we are spared from experiencing the pain of loss. Jesus never hurries to save us from that. Our hope is simply in Jesus himself, who is greater than that for which we had hoped&quot; (p.134).<br />The last two pages sum up the book very well:<br />&quot;Now, return with me to the long line of broken lives waiting to receive Communion on Christmas Eve. In holding up the body of Christ, what hope do I give them for next year? Does the broken body promise that things will get better if they just hang on? In the moment in which my eye catches theirs, do I wink as if to say, \\"Yes, but soon God will fix it all if you only have faith? No. Absolutely not....<br />What I hold up that night is the hope that God has found them. If they can see that, if even for a moment, it is enough. Then everything has changed. Nothing may be different, but those who have realized that they journey with God perceive everything differently. A bit more of the unpredictable light of Christ has broken into the darkness that surrounds us all&quot; (pp. 180, 181).<br />So what is my opinion of this book? I like the reference in the last sentence quoted above to Christ's \\"light\\" shining in the \\"darkness\\" given I direct a ministry called \\"Darkness to Light.\\" But beyond that, I'm not really sure.<br />In a way this book is depressing. I would like to think that as my life crumbles around me I can trust God to turn things around. But this book is saying that's not the case. Things just might get worse, not better. My health, finances, and other aspects of my life just might continue to get worse.<br />I would like to think that I can trust God to give me some direction or meaning in life. But again, this book is saying that's not the case. My life just might continue to be directionless and meaningless.<br />To say that God is my \\"hope\\" sounds good, but it is really difficult to grab onto such a nebulous concept in the mist of struggles. But when everything is going wrong, such a nebulous hope is about all that is left.<br />To trust in Christ Himself and not in what He can do for me is a struggle, but it is all the only secure hope that the suffering person can grasp onto. Everything and anything else provides no secure foundation. Anything else a person trusts in can fail or be taken away. Only Christ Himself is a secure refuge for the suffering person.<br />If the reader is looking for help in trusting God to \\"work things out,\\" then I wouldn't recommend this book. It will be just be a discouragement. But if you're looking for help in trusting in God Himself as your only hope in life, then this Book will be very worthwhile.worse.<br />I would like to think that I can trust God to give me some direction or meaning in life.

US	52152862	R1GKEHIEDCUXTI	0880702877	384797403	Is My Bible the Inspired Word of God	Books	1	4	13	N	N	Faulty theory of inspiration and Bible translation	In this book, Goodrick claims that the original autographs of the Bible are inspired, that all copies (i.e. manuscripts) of the autographs are inspired, and that all translations of the Bible are inspired.<br />The first claim I agree with, but there are so many problems with the other two claims I really don't know where to begin. But let's begin with a few facts.<br />Some manuscripts have \\"God\\" at the beginning of 1Timonthy 3:16, some have \\"who,\\" and a couple have \\"which.\\" So the question is, which of these readings is inspired? They are inherently contradictory. But most of all, all textual critics agree that the last reading is an obvious mistake. So did God inspired a scribe to make a mistake?<br />As for translations being inspired, there are so many differences between them its hard to see how anyone could claim they are all inspired. For instance, in 1Corinthians 7:1, some versions have Paul writing, \\"It is good for a man not to touch a woman,\\" some have \\"not to get married,\\" others have \\"not to have sexual relations with a woman,\\" along with a variety of other readings, like \\"have nothing to do with women.\\" Again, these readings are very clearly different.<br />So how does Goodrick defend his ideas of inspiration of manuscripts and versions? Answer: by his doctrine of inspiration. Goodrick believes in \\"conceptual inspiration\\" while specifically disavowing verbal inspiration (p.78). IOW, Goodrick believes the meaning of the Scriptures is inspired but not their very words. So God inspired the thoughts of the Biblical writers but not their very words.<br />And if God only inspired the thoughts of the Biblical writers then a translation should strive to translate their thoughts rather than their words. This would lead to a dynamic equivalency method of translation, which a is thought for thought method. This method is opposed to literal or formal methods, which are word for methods.<br />So it would be logical for a person who believes in verbal inspiration to believe that a literal or formal equivalence method is the best for translating the Bible. And conversely, a person who believes in conceptual inspiration would logically favor dynamic equivalence. However, most people today who advocate a dynamic equivalence method say they believe in verbal inspiration, and thus are rather inconsistent. But at least Goodrick is consistent in this regard.<br />So the questions then becomes, did God only inspire the thoughts of the Biblical writers, or did He inspire their very words and even the grammatical forms of the words they wrote?<br />The following quote is taken from my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions\\" (p.16): \\"That the Biblical authors believed in verbal inspiration is evident. Jesus appealed to the tense of a verb for proof of resurrection and the exact wording of a Psalm to demonstrate His Lordship (Matt 22:31,32, 41-45). Paul pointed out that a word was singular, not plural, to show a prophecy applied to Christ (Gal 3:16; see also Deut 4:2; 1Kings 8:56; Josh 21:43-45; 23:14; Prov 30:5,6; Jer 26:2; John 6:63).\\"<br />To look at one of these examples, Paul stated in Galatians 3:16 that since the word \\"Seed\\" in Genesis 12:3 is singular, the prophecy was referring to one Person, Christ. But what is notable is that most dynamic equivalency versions have the plural \\"decedents\\" rather than the singular \\"Seed\\" in Gen 12:3. So if one were only reading such a version, you would think Paul was a liar.<br />The point is, when a translation tries to render only the supposed \\"thoughts\\" of the Bible then important points can and are missed. Moreover, it is not always clear what the intended thoughts or the author's actual words were. For instance, in 1Cor 7:1 above, a comparison of different versions will show that the opinions of the translators as to what Paul was thinking when he wrote \\"not to touch a woman\\" vary considerably. I discuss the differences between these versions in much greater detail in my book.<br />Moreover, the meaning of a passage can change due to textual variants. When Paul wrote 1Tim 3:16, was he thinking of Christ's deity or not? With the reading of \\"God\\" he was, but with the reading of \\"who\\" he was not. So one of these class of manuscripts do not capture the \\"thought\\" of what Paul originally wrote.\\"<br />The fact remains is, there are very real and clear differences between manuscripts and between Bible versions. And these differences are not just a difference of words but of thoughts and meanings. I give many specific verses of where the meaning changes between manuscripts and versions in my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions\\" (hence the name). So it simply is not and cannot be true that all manuscripts and versions are inspired, even if one ascribes to conceptual inspiration.<br />To go along with his idea of conceptual inspiration, Goodrick writes, \\"It is impossible to translate the Bible word for word\\" (p.71). Since I produced the \\"Analytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament,\\" I know first hand that a word for word translation IS possible. Now Goodrick claims such a translation would not be readable, but a common comment I have received in regards to my translation is that it is surprisingly easy to read. And in my book on Bible versions go into details why this is so.<br />Given these very serious problems, I would not recommend Goodrick's book. It advocates a very faulty theory of inspiration and Bible translation.r, the meaning of a passage can change due to textual variants. When Paul wrote 1Tim 3:16, was he thinking of Christ's deity or not? With the reading of \\"God\\" he was, but with the reading of \\"who\\" he was not.

I give many specific verses of where the meaning changes between manuscripts and versions in my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions\\" (hence the name). So it simply is not and cannot be true that all manuscripts and versions are inspired, even if one ascribes to conceptual inspiration.<br />To go along with his idea of conceptual inspiration, Goodrick writes, \\"It is impossible to translate the Bible word for word\\" (p.71). Since I produced the \\"Analytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament,\\" I know first hand that a word for word translation IS possible. Now Goodrick claims such a translation would not be readable, but a common comment I have received in regards to my translation is that it is surprisingly easy to read. And in my book on Bible versions go into details why this is so.<br />Given these very serious problems, I would not recommend Goodrick's book. It advocates a very faulty theory of inspiration and Bible translation.	2001-08-12

For the former, Green prefers the \\"Textus Receptus\\" (TR), which underlines the KJV, NKJV, and Green's own \\"Literal Translation of the Bible,\\" or the Majority Text (MT), which my \\"Analytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament\\" is based on. These two texts are very similar, but they differ from the Critical Text, which the six versions Green reviews in this book are based on (i.e. the NASB, NIV, REB, NRSV, GNB, NAB).<br />Green believes either the TR or the MT more accurately reflect the original autographs than the CT. And I concur with this assessment. He shows the differences in these texts by reviewing dozens of verses and pointing out which of these versions differ from the reading in the TR.<br />Next he tackles the issue of translation principle. All of these versions (except the NASB) follow a dynamic equivalence translation method. This principle is less accurate than the literal or formal equivalence principle that Green advocates. Green uses arrows to show where these versions omit words, and he uses brackets to show where they add words. Green calculates the number of omitted and added words after each verse. He then provides a short discussion on the significance of these changes.<br />I very much agree with Green that leaving words untranslated is not appropriate for a Bible version. EVERYTHING God said is important, and I don't believe translators should take it upon themselves to decide that some words are not important and thus leave them untranslated.<br />Conversely, adding words without offsetting them in some way as all these versions do (except of the NASB) is also inappropriate. Such a practice leaves the reader with no way of distinguishing between the actual words of God and the words added by the translators. And to make matters worse, sometimes these additions are interpretative. So what one ends up with is part translation and part commentary.<br />But I should note a couple of caveats. First, Green sometimes finds problems in translations when there really are none. So sometimes he has arrows or brackets when a word really has not been omitted or added. Green seems to think that there is only one correct way to translate a passage and any deviation from this is a problem. But very often there is more than one legitimate way to translate a passage.<br />Second, Green can be a little harsh in his comments on modern versions and even in his comments about their translators.  Such language is really unnecessary. But even with these problems, Green's book is very helpful.<br />Since I produced a literal translation of the NT which is based on the MT, it should be obvious that I whole-heatedly agree with Green's positions on these important matters. In fact, I cover much of the same ground as Green does in my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions.\\" However, in my book I never use harsh language, and I try to be as accurate and fair as I can in my evaluations of versions./>But I should note a couple of caveats.

However, this volume is very helpful for its textual apparatus. Where there are significant variants, at the bottom of the page are notations indicating which manuscripts support the reading found in the text, along with the manuscript support for other readings. And these other readings are often found in the MT or TR. So this book is helpful for doing studies on textual variants.<br />In fact, I utilized this book extensively when I was working on my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions.\\" My book has a chapter looking at textual variants between the MT and the CT and another looking at variants between the MT and the TR. And in these chapters I cite the manuscript evidence from this Greek Testament.<br />However, the conclusions I come to are often different than the ones the editors of the text came to. One reason for this difference is our differing opinions as to whether the handful of Alexandrian or the mass of Byzantine manuscripts are more reliable. The editors of this volume believe the former are while I believe the latter are. I discuss my reasons for preferring Byzantine manuscripts in my book, along with other issues separating those who favor these different Greek texts.<br />So I would recommend this \\"Greek Testament\\" for its textual apparatus. But before accepting its conclusions on variants, consult a book like mine for a different opinion.	2001-08-12

Since he was a professor of logic, his books always deal with the logical fallacies seen in the arguments of others. In this book, he exposes the fallacies seen in the reasoning of Critical Text (CT) advocates.<br />The CT is the Greek text most modern versions are based on. Meanwhile, the KJV is based on the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; (TR). But it should be noted that Clark is not a KJV onlyist. He speaks approvingly of the NKJV and the Majority Text (MT). The MT is similar to the TR, while both differ from the CT.<br />Clark deals with the textual question by looking at select verses from the NT, along with a couple from the OT. Along with showing the logical fallacies in the reasoning of CT advocates, he cites the manuscript evidence and shows how the CT reading is based on a minority of the evidence.<br />He also occasionally looks at the proper translation of passages. For these he explains that many modern versions mistranslate passages. The problem is, most modern versions follow a dynamic equivalence method of translation while Clark agrees with the formal equivalence method seen in the KVJ and NKJV.<br />So Clark's position is pro-TR/ MT, pro-formal equivalence. And with both of these I whole-heartedly agree. In fact, I present the same positions in my book &quot;Differences Between Bible Versions.&quot; Clark's booklet is a good place to start in studying these issues, and my book will provide much more detail.	2001-08-12

By \\"standard text\\" the Alands are referring to either the text they helped to edit, the Nestle-Aland text, or the text by the United Bible Societies. With their most recent editions, these two texts are now identical and can be referred to as the Critical Text (CT).<br />This books provides a history of editions of the Greek NT, from Erasmus's text of the 1500's down to today's CT. This background information is helpful, but the discussion is obviously more favorably to the discoveries that led to the development of the CT than to those supporting the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; (TR) and the more recent MT. Of these three texts, this writer prefers the MT or even the TR to the CT, so much so that I utilized the &quot;Byzantine Majority Text&quot; when I produced my &quot;Analytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament.&quot;<br />That said, the Alands then discuss what they believe was the history of the transmission of the NT in the earliest centuries. And once again, their theory in this regard favors the Alexandrian texts underlining the CT rather than the Byzantine texts underlining the TR and MT.<br />In my book &quot;Differences Between Bible Versions&quot; I present an alternative theory of the transmission of the manuscripts, based on the work of Robinson and Pierpont, the producers of the &quot;Byzantine Majority Text.&quot;<br />The Alands then look in depth at the different kinds of manuscripts. Some of the information in this section is very helpful. For instance, they give detailed discussions on how the materials used by scribes were produced. I refer to this information in the chapter on \\"An Introduction to Textual Criticism\\" in my book. Also interesting in this section of the Alands' book are the pictures of early manuscripts. There are also extensive lists of manuscripts.<br />But where I disagree with the Alands is in their evaluations of the reliability of different manuscripts. For instance, they consider Alexandrian texts to be the most reliable while Byzantine texts are said to \\"irrelevant for textual criticism\\" (p.155). In my book I argue for the exact opposite position. I believe the Alexandrian texts are more likely corrupted while the mass of Byzantine texts are more reliable.<br />The Alands also look at early translations of the NT and provide information on using modern editions of the Greek NT, meaning the text they helped edit or the UBS text. The textual apparatuses in these Greek texts enable one to study the manuscript evidence behind textual variants, but they can be confusing. So an explanation on how to use the apparatuses is helpful.<br />In the last chapter, the Alands present their \\"Twelve Basic Rules of Textual Criticism.\\" I critique many of these \\"rules\\" in my book and show how they are not really that sound of rules. The book then closes with a look at verses with textual variants. I do the same in my book. But again, we come to opposite conclusions.<br />So my recommendation on this book would be to go ahead and get it. It does provide helpful information on Greek manuscripts and today's published Greek texts. And it will give the reader one side of the textual debate, the pro-CT side.

Carson compares the \\"Critical Text\\" (CT, UBS/ Nestle-Aland text) to the \\"Textus Receptus\\" (TR). And he presents why He believes the CT is to be preferred to the CT.<br />More importantly, he does not discuss the Majority Text (MT). Since the MT was first published after this book came out this is understandable. But it should be noted that some of Carson's arguments would only apply to the TR but not to the MT.<br />For instance, Carson discusses 1John 5:7,8 in a couple of places in his book. The \\"extra\\" words in this passage are in the TR, but not in the CT. But they are also not in the MT.<br />Of these three texts, I prefer the MT to TR and either of these texts to the CT. It is not possible to evaluate each of Carson's arguments for the CT in a short review. However, I address the kind of arguments Carson presents and even quote from Carson book and from many others by CT advocates in my book \\"Differences Between Bible Versions.\\"<br />A smaller section of this book is discusses translation principle. Carson appears to prefer a \\"dynamic equivalence\\" form of translating (as seen in the NIV, NLT, and many others) to formal equivalence (seen in the KJV, NKJV, NASB). In my book I detail the many potential problems with dynamic equivalence, and recommend instead formal equivalence or even a literal translation method.<br />Carson's main argument against a more literal style of translation is that he claims it is too awkward to read. However, most people find a version like the NKJV to be more than readable. In addition, I produced the \\"Analytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament\\" (ALT). And my translation is even more literal than the NKJV. But a common comment I have received in regards to my translation is that it is surprisingly easy to read. So it really is not necessary to alter the word of God to make it readable.<br />And altering God's actual words is exactly what dynamic equivalent versions do. I give many examples in my book of where such versions add words without any indication they have done so, omit words from the text they are supposed to be translating, alter the grammatical forms of words, insert ideas foreign to the Scriptures into them, and interpret rather than translation. All of these changes make these versions more like commentaries on the Bible rather than actual translations.<br />The adding, omitting, and altering of words is in contradiction to the doctrine of verbal inspiration and the commands and warnings in Scriptures not to alter God's words. And worse, the reader of such a version has no way of knowing when ideas are being added to the Scriptures or where the text is being interpreted rather than translated. And what if the translators are wrong in their interpretations of Scriptures?<br />This is a very important issue. So before making a decision, it would be prudent to study all sides. Carson presents the pro-CT, pro-formal equivalence viewpoint while my book presents a pro-MT/ TR, literal/ formal equivalence view. Both books disagree with KJV onlyism, but there are many KJV onlyist books and Web sites to look at. I deal with arguments from many of these in my book.ve many examples in my book of where such versions add words without any indication they have done so, omit words from the text they are supposed to be translating, alter the grammatical forms of words, insert ideas foreign to the Scriptures into them, and interpret rather than translation.

This harshness should be obvious just from the title of the book. To claim that ALL new versions are \\"new age\\" is to really throw down the gauntlet.<br />And Riplinger doesn't stop there. She attributes all new versions to the work of Satan. Now let me say from the start, I do have serious concerns with many, but by no means all, new versions. But there is no reason to use such disparaging language as Riplinger does.<br />That said, Riplinger's pattern in this book is about the same as seen throughout KJV onlyist literature. She will cite a passage or word from the KJV and then one from \\"new age versions.\\" She then just assumes the KJV is correct and the new versions are incorrect. She never appeals to the Hebrew and Greek texts and standard lexicons to demonstrate the KJV reading is in fact superior. But without recourse to the original languages, this is just circular reasoning.<br />But the fact remains is, there are passages in the KJV that are not translated as accurately as they could be. And in many of these cases, new versions, such as the NKJV, translate these passages correctly. I detail many such instances in my book &quot;Differences Between Bible Versions.&quot;  But unlike Riplinger's book, in my book I refer constantly to Hebrew and Greek lexicons, documenting very carefully where the KJV is accurate and where it is not so accurate.<br />Second, Riplinger makes the very interesting claim that the KJV is somehow easier to read than modern versions. She tries to support this claim by appealing to a computer program that supposedly showed the KJV is easier to read than modern versions and by claiming the KJV uses \\"easier\\" words than modern versions.<br />But both of these claims can be easily explained. Take for instance the KJV word \\"ere\\" (Exod 1:19). This is a very \\"easy\\" word by Riplinger's standards. It only has three letters and one syllable, but most readers today wouldn't even know what it means. The modern-day equivalent is \\"before,\\" which a computer would consider to be a more difficult word since it has six letters and two syllables. But most readers would find \\"before\\" to be much easier than \\"ere.\\"<br />Next Riplinger makes her case against the modern-day \\"Critical Text\\" (UBS, Nestle-Aland text). Now I do agree with her that the Critical Text (CT) is less accurate than the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; (TR) or Majority Text (MT). However, when discussing on this subject I would never use the disparaging language that Riplinger does.<br />Moreover, Riplinger confuses the MT and the TR. The TR is the text the KJV is based on, but the MT is a more recent text developed from the many more manuscripts that have been discovered since the time the KJV was translated.<br />Now these two texts are very similar, much more similar than either is to the CT. However, there are some significant differences between them. And in these cases, there is overwhelming manuscript support in favor of the reading of the MT but very little in support of the TR's reading.<br />But the important point here is, most of Riplinger's arguments would only be applicable to the MT, not the TR. So her arguments are not really supporting the KJV. If she really believed the MT is the most accurate Greek text, then Riplinger should use a version based on it. There are two such versions available: the World English Bible and my own Analytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament.<br />In my Bible versions book I detail very carefully the differences between these three texts and present in a straightforward not disparaging manner why I prefer the MT to the CT and even the TR.<br />So overall, I cannot recommend Riplinger's book. The harsh language is simply unnecessary and there is too much faulty logic, circular reasoning, and confusion of issues.<br />For a much more balanced approach to the Bible versions controversy, see my book &quot;DifferencesBetween Bible Versions.&quot; It has an entire section (100 pages) demonstrating the problems seen in KJV only literature like Riplinger's. But it also details the many problems seen in many modern day versions.<br />I advocate the use of the MT or TR and a literal or formal equivalence method of translating. And simply put, if Riplinger wasn't being so dogmatic, she would agree with this standard. And rather than telling people they must use the KJV or they are \\"new age\\" she would also recommend versions like the &quot;New King James Version,&quot; the &quot;Literal Translation of the Bible,&quot; or my own &quot;Analytical-Literal Translation.&quot;Between Bible Versions.&quot; It has an entire section (100 pages) demonstrating the problems seen in KJV only literature like Riplinger's.

He does so by looking at verses that support the various attributes of Christ that only God can have, such as omnipotence and omnipresence. But Green shows how the way these verses read in many new versions they no longer support the deity of Christ.<br />The reason for this problem is most new versions are based on the Critical Text (CT) and follow a dynamic equivalence translation method. Meanwhile, versions like the KJV, NKJV, and Green's own Literal Translation of the Bible (LITV) are based on the &quot;Textus Receptus\\" (TR) and my Analytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament (ALT) is based on the Majority (MT), and all of these versions follow a literal or formal equivalence translation method.<br />To explain, dynamic equivalence refers to a thought for thought translation method while formal equivalence refers to a word for word method. But the problem with the former is that by only translating the thoughts of the original writers, important points of a verse can be left out, such as proofs for Christ's deity.<br />As or the issue of Greek text type, the MT and TR are very similar, but there are some significant differences between, but there are far more significant differences between either of these and the CT. And some of these differences affect verses relevant to the deity of Christ.<br />So this book shows there are differences between a CT/ dynamic equivalence version and a TR/ MT-formal equivalence-literal type of version. And these are not minor differences but can affect very important issues, such as the Deity of Christ.<br />However, this difference between types of versions is somewhat exaggerated in Green's book. Sometimes he claims a version mistranslates a verse when in fact it has not. Green seems to think that there is only one correct way to translate a passage and any deviation from this is a problem. But very often there is more than one legitimate way to translate a passage.<br />Also, Green tends to be rather disparaging in his comments about versions and even their translators.

The Byzantine texts have been written off as being \\"conflations\\" from a later time than the Alexandrian texts. And this attitude has led to the creation of today's Critical Text (CT).<br />However, others have staunchly maintained that the Alexandrian manuscripts are not that reliable and that the Byzantine texts in fact preserve readings dating to the earliest centuries. And since the Byzantine texts comprise the vast majority of the manuscripts, this text is referred to as the Majority Text (MT). And this book by Sturz proves that the Byzantine texts are in fact much more reliable than CT scholars would like to admit.<br />But first it should be noted that Sturz is not a supporter of the MT per se. He takes a middle position in this debate. He simply believes, &quot;... the Byzantine text should be recognized as having an important and useful place in textual criticism because it is an independent witness to an early form of the New Testament text&quot; (p.23).<br />Sturz explains why he disagrees with the CT assessment of the Byzantine text, &quot;Although the reasoning of Westcott and Hort seemed sound at the time they wrote, discoveries since then have undermined the confident appraisal that characteristically Syrian [Byzantine] readings are necessarily late&quot; (p.55).<br />The most important of these discoveries was several Egyptian papyri. Sturz lists &quot;150 distinctively Byzantine readings&quot; found in these papyri. Included in his list are papyri numbers 13, 45, 46, 47, 49, 59, 66, 72, 74, and 75 (pp. 61, 145-159).<br />Sturz brings up another very important point about these papyri, &quot;They attest the early existence of readings in the Eastern part of the Roman empire in which the Byzantine and the properly (i.e. geographically) Western witnesses agree and at the same time are opposed by the Alexandrian&quot; (p.70).<br />IOW, some early &quot;Western&quot; texts agree with the Byzantine tradition where it differs from the Alexandrian. Sturz lists 170 of these types of readings (pp.160-174).<br />Sturz concludes, &quot;In view of the above, it is concluded that the papyri supply valid evidence that distinctively Byzantine readings were not created in the fourth century but were already in existence before the end of the second century and that, because of this, Byzantine readings merit serious consideration&quot; (p.69).<br />And Sturz asks the question, &quot;What about Byzantine readings which occur in parts of the New Testament where there are no papyri, AS YET, to confirm them?&quot; (p.64, emphasis in original). The problem is that even with the most recent discoveries, the papyri data is still rather sparse.<br />Sturz's supports these statements with extensive charts documenting these Byzantine readings in the early papyri. He also demonstrates that Byzantine readings have been found in the writings of the Church Fathers. And he explains that the Byzantine text was not created by a fourth century \\"conflation\\" as CT scholars have claimed.<br />So overall, this book does a thorough job of showing that the Byzantine texts are just as reliable manuscripts as Alexandrian manuscripts. Now I would go a step further and say the Byzantine manuscripts are in fact more reliable than Alexandrian manuscripts. And I document my reasons for believing so in my book &quot;Differences Between Bible Versions.&quot; But I quote from Sturz's book in my book as it at least provides a foundation for accepting that the Byzantine texts are reliable.by the Alexandrian&quot; (p.70).<br />IOW, some early &quot;Western&quot; texts agree with the Byzantine tradition where it differs from the Alexandrian.

And he explains that the Byzantine text was not created by a fourth century \\"conflation\\" as CT scholars have claimed.<br />So overall, this book does a thorough job of showing that the Byzantine texts are just as reliable manuscripts as Alexandrian manuscripts. Now I would go a step further and say the Byzantine manuscripts are in fact more reliable than Alexandrian manuscripts. And I document my reasons for believing so in my book &quot;Differences Between Bible Versions.&quot; But I quote from Sturz's book in my book as it at least provides a foundation for accepting that the Byzantine texts are reliable.	2001-08-12
US	52152862	RV4340YEAKCMG	1878442635	261164903	1: Unholy Hands on the Bible: An Introduction to Textual Criticism	Books	4	41	42	N	N	Excellent defense of the Textus Receptus/ Majority Text	This volume was edited by Jay P. Green, and he has added some of his own material. But the bulk of the book is taken from the writings of Burgon (1813-1888).<br />Burgon was a stanch defender of the Textus Receptus (TR) against the then new text of Westcott and Hort (WH). Today's Majority Text (MT) is very similar to the TR and today's Critical Text (CT) to the WH text.<br />This volume actually contains several books by Burgon. The first book defends \\"The Traditional Text of the New Testament\\" against the new WH text.<br />The following quote summarizes his argument: &quot;Does the truth of the Text of Scripture dwell with the vast multitude of copies, uncial and cursive, concerning which nothing is more remarkable than the MARVELOUS AGREEMENT which subsists between them? Or is it rather to be supposed that the truth abides exclusively with a very little handful of manuscripts, which at once differ from the great bulk of the manuscripts, and also differ widely among themselves?&quot; (p.9).<br />He then lists and explains his \\"Seven Notes of Truth.\\" They are: 1. Antiquity, or Primitiveness. 2. Consent of Witnesses, or Number. 3. Variety of Evidence, or Catholicity [i.e. geographical distribution]. 4. Respectability of Witnesses, or Weight. 5. Continuity, or Unbroken Tradition. 6. Evidence of the Entire passage, or Context. 7. Internal Considerations, or Reasonableness (UnHoly, Vol. I, p.15).<br />These Seven Notes of Truth are still followed today by MT scholars, such as Robinson and Pierpont, the producers of the Byzantine Majority Text. This writer used this Greek text when producing my Analytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament. So indirectly, Burgon had an influence on my translation work.<br />The second book looks at \\"The Cause of the Corruption of the Traditional Text of the Gospels.\\" He then goes into detail on various accidental and intentional causes of corruption. He demonstrates why it is manuscripts like Aleph and Beta, which WH favored, which are more likely to have these corruptions than the Byzantine manuscripts underlining the TR.<br />Next he looks at \\"The Last Twelve Verses of the Gospel According to Mark.\\" He explains why a few manuscripts more likely omitted this passage than that it was added to the bulk of manuscripts. He does the same with the story of \\"The Woman Taken in Adultery\\" (John 7:53-8:11).<br />He also looks at \\"The Revision Revised.\\" This is \\"A Critique of the English Revised Version of 1881.\\" Although the RV is no longer popular, most new versions still follow the ideas underlining it. So this book is still relevant today.<br />Then Burgon demonstrates the \\"Proof of the Genuineness of God Manifested on the Flesh.\\" This is a detailed defense of the reading of \\"God\\" in the TR in 1Timonthy 3:16 rather than the WH text reading of \\"who.\\" This variant is important as with \\"God\\" the verse demonstrates the deity of Christ, but with \\"who\\" this proof-text is lost.<br />Then comes a book on \\"The Secret Spanking of Westcott and Hort.\\" This book demonstrates fallacies in the reasoning of WH. The volume then closes with a short book on \\"Conflation and the `Neutral' Text.\\" In this book Burgon critiques Hort's textual transmission theory.<br />Overall, Burgon's writings are very in-depth. The amount of information in this book can be overwhelming, and it is rather difficult reading. So this volume is not for the person new to the subject. For such a person I would suggest my book Differences Between Bible Versions. It has an entire section on Greek text types, starting with a chapter titled \\"Introduction to Textual Criticism.\\" So my book would be the place to begin, and Burgon's books in this volume would be the place to go for much greater detail.are more likely to have these corruptions than the Byzantine manuscripts underlining the TR.<br />Next he looks at \\"The Last Twelve Verses of the Gospel According to Mark.\\" He explains why a few manuscripts more likely omitted this passage than that it was added to the bulk of manuscripts.

So it hard for a JW to claim that this book misrepresent their teachings.<br />Each of these subjects have a bearing on the authority of the Watchtower.

Sproul presents the Calvinist viewpoint, but is respectful towards the Arminian viewpoint.<br />What many will appreciate is that Sproul first discusses his own struggle with this subject. As with most people, when first confronted with the idea of election, he rebelled against it. But in Sproul's case, John Gerstner, and a thorough study of the Scriptures, brought him to accept the Biblical doctrine of predestination.<br />Sproul overviews the main Biblical and logical arguments for predestination and the five points of Calvinism in general. He also provides an exegesis of some verses commonly cited against the five points. And he cites many Scripture references supporting the Calvinist viewpoint. Many more such supporting verses and refutations of proposed contrary verses are contained in the three chapters on this subject in my book \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\"<br />If you've never studied this subject, you really need to.

This book covers a wide variety of new religious groups, both ones that claim to Christian, like Mormons and JWs, and New Age type groups like Hare Krishnas and Baha'i. The professor preferred this volume to Walter Martin's \\"Kingdom of the Cults.\\" I believe the reason why is this book is less \\"harsh\\" in its evaluations of the teachings of these groups than Martin's.<br />When this book evaluates each group's teachings, it is more with the attitude of, \\"This is something that should be considered\\" than Martins' \\"I'm right, you're wrong, that settles it\\" attitude.<br />For each group, Tucker gives a rather extensive review of its background and history, including a short biography of the group's founder and other important figures in its history. The \\"distinctive doctrines\\" of the group are then explained. And lastly, she provides what she calls \\"challenges\\" to these doctrines. But she emphasis that this should be done in a respectful manner. She is correct is saying that false teachings do need to be confronted, but it is possible to do so in a loving a respectful manner (1Peter 3:15).  However, one deficiency of this book is it does not have that many Scripture references in it. Tucker seems to assume that the reader knows the Biblical basis for such basic Christian doctrines as the Trinity. And she generally provides logical not Biblical refutations of each group's teachings.<br />To study what the Bible has to say on such doctrines, one would need to consult a book like my \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\" It presents hundreds of verses supporting basic Christian doctrines, such as the nature of God and the Trinity, and it provides rebuttals to interpretations these groups place on verses they quote in trying to support their doctrines.<br />Tucker's book is very helpful for the background information on these groups and the respectful attitude she presents.

But the title is somewhat misleading. It doesn't tell you that this book is mainly about the sovereignty of God. But if you're looking for help in handling rough time, this book will be a Godsend. The way to deal with difficult time is by trusting God. And only by understanding His absolute sovereignty can one really trust Him.<br />Bridges presents three reasons why we can trust God:<br />1. God is omniscient, so He knows what is best for us. 2. God is sovereign, so He is able to bring about what is best for us. 3. God is love, so He wants us to have what is best for us.<br />Most Christians easily accept that God is omniscient and that He is love. But sometimes they don't truly understand the full implications of these two attributes of God. But Bridges does a good job of explaining these implications.<br />But the bulk of this book and where it really shines is in the extensive discussion on point number two. Bridges present many Scripture verses supporting the Biblical teaching of God's absolute sovereignty. And he does a thorough job of bringing out the implications of these verses.<br />In fact, I found this book so helpful that I went back and consulted this book when I was developing the chapter on \\"The Sovereignty of God\\" in my book \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\"  I would highly recommend this book for the person going through hard times and for anyone who simply wants to understand the true Biblical doctrine of God's sovereignty.

But this will only happen if one is willing to really consider this issue. And the way to consider it is to look up the Scripture references Pink cites in this book. And Pink references many, many such verses.<br />In fact, this book was one of the sources I used in developing the chapter on \\"The Sovereignty of God\\" in my book \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\" My book also has two additional chapters addressing other aspects of Calvinism.<br />But be forewarned, studying this subject can be very distressing. I know of people who have gone through much emotional struggle when reading books like Pink's. It is simply hard to accept that God is in control of our destinies, not us.

The quotes concern both false prophecies by the Watchtower and its reversals on many of its doctrines through the years.<br />My favorite example of how the Watchtower has reversed itself of it teachings is on page 116:<br />The men of Sodom will be resurrected.  WT 7/1879, p.8<br />The men of Sodom will not be resurrected.  WT 6/1/1952, p. 479.<br />The men of Sodom will be resurrected. WT 8/1/1965, p. 479<br />The men of Sodom will not be resurrected. WT 6/1/1988, p.31.<br />The men of Sodom will be resurrected. \\"Live Forever,\\" earlier editions, p.179.<br />The men of Sodom will not be resurrected. \\"Live Forever,\\" later editions, p.179.<br />The men of Sodom will be resurrected. \\"Insight, Vol.2, p. 985.<br />The men of Sodom will not be resurrected. \\"Revelation,\\" p. 273.<br />It's interesting to note that the last two books were both published in the same year, 1988. And this is not a minor issue as whether the Sodomites will be resurrected or not has a bearing on whether a JW's departed, non-JW loved ones will be resurrected or not.<br />Since the Watchtower claims to be \\"God's Channel of Communication\\" and a \\"Prophet\\" as Reed documents in this book, these false prophecies and reversals on doctrines are very damaging to the Watchtower. If the Watchtower was truly what it claimed to be it should infallible. But these quotes clearly show that it is not.<br />In addition, it is very sad that many JWs have struggled extensively due to some doctrines that were later changed. For instance, the teaching that vaccinations were wrong forced many JWs to find creative ways to get around their schools' requirement that their children be vaccinated. But since the Watchtower has now rescinded this directive, this means previous generations of JWs suffered needlessly. Could the same happen in regards to blood transfusions in the future?<br />However, JWs are conditioned by the Watchtower not to view anything that appears critical of the Watchtower. So to get a JW to actually consider the information in this book, one would have to attain the cited books themselves or write out the quotes and their sources on a separate sheet of paper and give that to the JW.<br />Also, pointing out the false prophecies and reversals of doctrines of the Watchtower is only one way to deal with JWs. Another way is to address the doctrines of the Watchtower. And Reed has other books that look at what the Scriptures have to say about Watchtower teachings. And there are three chapters on the Trinity and one on various other Watchtower teachings in my book \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\"<br />So get this book by Reed to prepare yourself to address this area of the Watchtower, and get one of Reed's other books or my &quot;Scripture Workbook&quot; to prepare yourself for Biblical discussions.Watchtower not to view anything that appears critical of the Watchtower.

Walter Martin was a pioneer in the Christian, counter-cults movement. And since Martin's death, Hanegraaff has kept this volume up to date.<br />Martin discusses groups like JWs and Mormonism, new age movements like spiritualism, and world religions like Islam. For each group Martin gives an overview of its history and teachings. Then he critiques those teachings from a Biblical and logical perspective in a very thorough manner.<br />In some reviews of this book, members of these groups are claiming that this book misrepresents their teachings. But the book includes numerous quotations from each group's own writings to document their teachings. And references are given for these quotes. So before claiming Martin is misrepresenting a group's teachings, one can easily check the original source in the group's library or archives.<br />However, it must be said that Martin does come across as being rather \\"strong-headed\\" in his views. He often presents a, \\"I'm right, you're wrong, that settles it\\" attitude. And this attitude can be disturbing for some.<br />But he does quote many Scripture references showing that the traditional, Christian understanding of doctrines are Biblical and that a particular group's interpretations are faulty.

It helped to settle in my mind the uniqueness of true Christianity. It also helped to answer lingering questions I had about other belief systems. So it helped to solidify my belief that the Christian faith was true and that other belief systems were false.<br />In the first section on cults the authors first discuss \\"What is a Cult?\\" They then present the basic characteristics of cults and the beliefs of orthodox Christianity. The beliefs are present via quotes from important Christian creeds, with supporting Biblical references. It's not a thorough Biblical study of such doctrines, but adequate for presenting the orthodox view. For a more thorough study on the basic doctrines of the Christian faith, see my \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\"<br />The first section of this book then looks at individual groups like JWs and Mormons. For each group it presents a very short history of the group.

The problem is, most of the people engaging in the debates problem don't actually know either of these languages. And I have never met with a JW who did. So I would say it is best not to get into debates with a JW over translations. It usually just ends up with one person quoting an \\"authority\\" (often out of context) against the other's quote.<br />It would be more fruitful to avoid such passages and look at the hundreds of verses in the Bible which bear on the question of Christ's deity and the Trinity in general. And fortunately Rhodes does reference many such verses. And for many more verses in this regard, see the three chapters on the Trinity in my book \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\" It contains hundreds of verses supporting the doctrine of the Trinity and refutes proposed arguments against it.<br />I also find it interesting that people say that discussing things like blood transfusions is a waste of time. But the fact is, many JWs have left the Watchtower over just this issue. When someone or his or her loved one is at death's door, abiding by this belief becomes much more than just an academic issue. So I think it is good that Rhodes addresses such doctrines in his book, as I do in a chapter on various Watchtower doctrines in my book.<br />As for Watchtower false prophecies, claiming we are human beings who all make mistakes doesn't negate the problem with the Watchtower in this regard. The fact is that the Watchtower has claimed to be a prophet, and the Bible declares that a prophet must be 100% accurate as Rhodes points out.<br />Moreover, many JWs' lives have been ruined by such false prophecies. There have been many JWs who never got married, had children, went to college, or the like because they saw no reason too since the end was coming \\"soon.\\" But as \\"soon\\" dragged on into years and decades, the JW is left regretting his or her life and the things they never did.<br />So yes, get Rhodes book.

We have both since moved to different states, although I have maintained some sporadic contact with him.<br />No Place for Sovereignty is Dr. Wright's first book. And it is sure to be controversial! Dr. Wright takes head-on the Arminian notion of human &quot;freewill.&quot;<br />In the very helpful Glossary at the end of the book, &quot;Freewill theory&quot; is defined as &quot;View that the human will is free to act independently of divine control or external causation. Arminians usually define it as the ability to choose good or evil equally. Hence, `the liberty of indifference'&quot; (p.236).<br />But is this concept true? Or more to the point for Christians, is it Biblical? Most Christians just assume that it is. But Dr. Wright demonstrates that this idea has more in common with Greek notions of autonomy than the Bible.<br />The book is divided into eleven chapters. Chapter One begins with a quick historical overview of the freewill controversy, from the time of the Apostolic Fathers to the present.<br />Dr. Wright then lists five reasons people believe in the freewill theory: 1. If we have no free will, we are not responsible for our actions. 2. It is essential to the image of God. 3. The denial of free will undermines both human effort and morality. 4. The Bible teaches free will. 5. Free will gets God off the hook in the problem of evil (pp.40,41).<br />Subsequent chapters then show that each of these claims is faulty, both logically and Biblically. In regards to the first claim, Chapter Two shows that a will &quot;free&quot; in the Arminian sense would not be responsible as it would be no different than chance. Responsibility is based on what God decides, not on what we decide.<br />As for the imago Dei, Chapter Three presents a study of passages in the Bible in which it is discussed. Dr. Wright concludes, &quot;Throughout all the biblical references to the image of God, its loss in the Fall and its restoration in Christ, not a hint appears that the image necessarily includes anything recognizable as free will. The Bible simply does not use the idea of free will as an explanatory category at all&quot; (p.76).<br />Chapter Four looks at Genesis chapter three and the Fall. It focuses on Eve's conversation with Satan and shows it was her desire to be autonomous from God that lead to her disobedience. Some consequences of the Fall are then noted.<br />As for human effort and morality, Dr. Wright states, &quot;... freewill theory destroys any hope of relating human action to God's sovereignty and makes human action purely a chance affair&quot; (p.40). These ideas are elaborated on in Chapter Five.<br />As for whether freewill theory is Biblical, Dr. Wright correctly notes that if any of the Five Points of Calvinism are true, then there can be no freewill in the Arminian sense. Chapters Six to Eight are then devoted to Biblical proofs of the Five Points of Calvinism.<br />Then Chapter Nine addresses the question, &quot;Are there any `Arminian verses' in the Bible?&quot; The chapter soundly exegetes supposedly Arminian verses and demonstrates that they simply do not teach what Arminians &quot;assume&quot; that they do.<br />Chapter Ten discusses the problem of evil. This question is often considered a &quot;stronghold&quot; for Arminians and unbelievers alike. The chapter first demonstrates that an appeal to freewill does not &quot;solve&quot; the problem but actually makes matters worse.<br />Dr. Wright then states very bluntly:<br />&quot;Let it be stated plainly here that the problem of evil can be solved in a straightforward manner by proposing that if God decides to predestine or decree any particular evils for any purpose he may intend, who are we to answer back to God (Rom 9:19-24)? However galling it may seem to the fleshly mind, God is the final reference point for what counts as the good, not me, the sinner. If there ever was a practical application of Jesus' prayer &quot;not my will but yours be done&quot; (Lk 22:42), this would be it. The good is good because God determines it as such, not because it conforms to my irrelevant innate conception of how things ought to be. It is wholly besides the point that I might personally prefer things to be otherwise&quot; (p.197).<br />Chapter Eleven demonstrates that a belief in human freewill can easily lead to a denial of essential attributes of God. As an example, the chapter chronicles Clark Pinnock's descent from a conservative Christian viewpoint of the attributes of God into finite godism.<br />This book covers a lot of ground and can be difficult reading at times, especially for those not familiar with the subject. But overall, it does a very effective job of refuting the commonly held notion of freewill, along with Arminianism in general.<br />I heartily recommend No Place for Sovereignty. And for further study on Calvinism, you can consult the three chapters on this subject in my book, \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\" These chapters include hundreds of verses supporting the Calvinist viewpoint while refuting proposed arguments against it.on of Jesus' prayer &quot;not my will but yours be done&quot; (Lk 22:42), this would be it.

So some claim that this invalidates the Genesis record. But P.J. Wiseman presents an interesting theory in this regard in this book.<br />He believes that Moses did not WRITE Genesis but rather TRANSLATED it from ancient stone tablets written in Cuneiform script. The tablets each would have been originally written by eye-witnesses of the particular events, or those who received their information from eye-witnesses.<br />He breaks Genesis into parts according to the phrase &quot;These are the generations&quot; (KJV; &quot;This is the history&quot; - NKJV; &quot;This the account&quot; - NASB; NIV; Gen 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10; 11:27; 25:12,9; 36:1,9; 37:2).<br />He compares the use of this phrase and the structure of each section to the stone tablets written in cuneiform script. Many of these tablets have been discovered and they date to the third millenium BC.<br />Wiseman's theory is that Genesis is translated from individual tablets which would have contained the material before each occurrence of the above phrase. So the narratives of the creation of the universe (Gen 1) and of the Garden of Eden (Gen 2) would have been written on one tablet by Adam as these events were revealed to him by the only Eye-witness of the events, God Himself.<br />The narratives of the Fall and subsequent events would have been written on another tablet by Adam as an eye-witness of the events. Adam then passed each of these tablets on to his descendant Seth. Seth then recorded the events of Gen 5 and passed the tablets to his descendant Noah. Noah then recorded the events of Gen 6-9 and passed the tablets to his descendant Shem, and so one until Joseph. Joseph then recorded the final chapters of Genesis and placed all of the tablets in the library of the pharaohs. Moses then, while in pharaoh's court, would have had access to these tablets. He then translated them into his native Hebrew.<br />The above theory &quot;fits&quot; with various evidences in the Scriptures. For instance, it would explain such passages as Exod 6:3: &quot;I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name, LORD [YHWH], I was not known to them.&quot; But the Tetragrammaton appears in Genesis, making for an apparent contradiction. However, this problem is easily explained if Moses translated, but did not write, Genesis. While translating, when Moses came across the name for God in the cuneiform tablets, he used the Name God revealed to him to translate it. So the Name YHWH was not known to Abraham and other Genesis figures.<br />Also, note that in the Bible Genesis is never said to be written by Moses, whereas the other four books of the Torah are. For instance, in Matt 18:4-5 Jesus refers to two quotes from Genesis. He introduces them with the general phrase, &quot;Have you not read....&quot; But in verse 8, when referring to a passage from Deuteronomy, Jesus specifically attributes the statement to Moses.<br />In addition, Wiseman's theory is consistent with the relationship of Gilgamesh and Genesis. There are some similarities between the two, yet many important differences. More specifically, if Genesis was translated from stone tablets written by the main characters of the events, then these tablets would pre-date the writing of Gilgamesh. Meanwhile, Gilgamesh was based on oral transmission of the events.<br />So the record in Genesis would be the accurate record; whereas Gilgamesh would be a somewhat &quot;twisted&quot; record. Being based on oral traditions passed over centuries, the latter would be expected to keep some of the main points intact but alter many of the details.<br />Wiseman's theory also fits with the archeological evidence of the character of the ancient cuneiform, stone tablets as compared to the Genesis narratives. There are many similarities in the writing structure between them. He summarizes all of the evidences on pages 144-148 of his book.<br />He concludes by stating: &quot;These twenty-four strands woven together make a cumulative muster of evidences, so exceptional both in character and importance, that they establish the antiquity of Genesis as a contemporary record of events upon a sure foundation. This foundation is the internal testimony of the book itself, supported by the external corroboration of archeology.&quot;<br />I don't know if I agree with all of Wiseman's ideas. But I do find them interesting.48 of his book.<br />He concludes by stating: &quot;These twenty-four strands woven together make a cumulative muster of evidences, so exceptional both in character and importance, that they establish the antiquity of Genesis as a contemporary record of events upon a sure foundation.

However, this book falls short of truly presenting the possible options.<br />The problem is, the person presenting the Calvinism view is writing from a \\"high-Calvinism\\" or \\"supralapsarian\\" viewpoint. This was the viewpoint of John Calvin. And the main idea in this view is that before (\\"supra\\") the Fall (\\"lapse\\"), to glorify Himself, God decided to create humanity so that He could save some of them while damning others. The saved would then glorify God for their salvation when seeing the plight of the damned.<br />However, this viewpoint is NOT the viewpoint that most Calvinists subscribe to, nor is it the position of the Westminster Confession. The view of most Calvinists and the Confession is \\"low-Calvinism\\" or \\"sublapsarianism.\\"<br />In this view, to glorify Himself and to extend His love, God created humanity. Then, AFTER (\\"sub\\") the Fall, God looked down the corridors of time and decided that out of the mass of sinful humanity He would, by His grace, save some while rightly damning the others for their sin. So this view does not have God creating people in order to damn them as the high-Calvinist view does. There are also other important differences between these two views.<br />Now in this book most of the arguments the non-Calvinists present against the Calvinist are actually directed towards the areas of Calvinism in which high-Calvinists and low-Calvinists disagree. IOW, the anti-Calvinists arguments would not apply to the version of Calvinism that most Calvinists subscribe to.<br />So when reading this book, one would not learn what the majority Calvinist viewpoint entails or proposed arguments against it. But my book \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible\\" does present this majority view in three chapters on God's Sovereignty and the five points of Calvinism.  And these chapters include hundreds of Scripture verses upholding the low-Calvinist viewpoint while refuting proposed arguments against it.<br />Given this omission of the predominate Calvinist view, I wouldn't particularly recommend \\"Predestination and Free Will.\\" But if one does get it, then also get a book like mine that presents the low-Calvinist position.e verses upholding the low-Calvinist viewpoint while refuting proposed arguments against it.<br />Given this omission of the predominate Calvinist view, I wouldn't particularly recommend \\"Predestination and Free Will.\\" But if one does get it, then also get a book like mine that presents the low-Calvinist position.	2001-06-14

More often than not, when people are first confronted with Calvinism view of God's sovereignty and salvation, they rebel against it. The concept simply goes against the natural mind's idea of how things should be.

The only thing that matters is: what do the Scriptures teach?<br />So if you are struggling with this topic, get this book and go through the studies. And most importantly, look up all of the Scripture references.

His thoroughness can be seen in every topic he covers. But his writing style is not the easiest to follow. He throws around a lot of terms and names that one not familiar with Christian theology and history might not know. But for the more advanced student of the Christian faith, expending the effort to understand Berkhof's will prove to be fruitful.<br />Berkhof very strongly presents a Reformed viewpoint. But the section on this subject really only constitutes a small percentage of the total work. Berkhof deals with all aspects of the Christian faith in as much depth as he does the Reformed view of salvation.<br />One area where I disagree with Berkhof is in regards to baptism. He present an infant baptism perspective while I believe in believer's baptism. But this is the only major disagreement I would have with Berkhof. So I would recommend this volume, but not as one's primary or only theology.<br />I would recommend consulting volumes like Lewis and Demarest's \\"Integrative Theology\\" or Erickson's \\"Systematic Theology\\" first, and Berkhof's only secondarily for comparison purposes.

However, there is not a lot of detail on any one of these issues as the book is only 152 pages.<br />My first impression of this book is that Cherry's interpretation of some Bible verses is rather suspect. For instance, he claims that the healing recorded in John chapter nine is a case of Jesus using medicinal and spiritual means to heal. But in no means can spit and dirt be considered to be a medicinal cure for congenital blindness! OTOH, most of the supposed spiritual healings Cherry reports could be attributed solely to psychological factors or the medical treatments that accompanied the prayer.<br />In regards to diet, Cherry believes the Bible teaches a Mediterranean style of eating. And he is probably correct for the most part. But I did scratch my head when he states throughout the book to limit red meat to three or four times per month but then in a chart on page 118 says to eat lean meat 1-2 times weekly. Most people would probably find the former to be rather restrictive.<br />He promotes a mostly plant based diet but takes a swipe at a full vegetarian diet at the beginning of the book. But his quick dismissal of vegetarianism doesn't do justice to those who have thrived on such a diet. I go into much greater detail on the pros and cons of a vegetarian diet in my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\" I also give a lot more details on diet related subjects that Cherry just glosses over.<br />In regards to supplements, Cherry recommends rather high doses of vitamins and minerals, especially the antioxidant nutrients. He seems to assume the evidence for their benefit is clear-cut. But as I detail in my book, the evidence is actually contradictory.<br />As for the discussion on the different healings using prayer and medical means, I did find one story to be instructive. A lady with ovarian cancer believed she was \\"led\\" by God to first use chemotherapy, but then she felt led to stop after just three treatments and then to depend solely on natural alternative treatments.<br />And it worked. The three chemotherapy treatments eliminated most of the cancer leaving it more manageable for the natural means. And by stopping after three treatments she didn't experience any of the common side effects of chemotherapy. If the unthinkable happens and I ever come down with cancer, this pattern of treatment will merit serious consideration.<br />As for the recipes, they are rather basic and seem to be a waste of space in such a small book.<br />Overall, this book does provide a good introduction to each of the main issues covered. But it is just that, an introduction. For details, one would have to turn to separate books devoted to each subject.id find one story to be instructive.

Cooper presents ways to do so through exercise, diet, and supplements. And it the supplements part that is the most controversial of this book.<br />Dr. Cooper was one of the first noted fitness experts to recommend people start taking high doses of the antioxidant vitamins beta-carotene (the precursor to vitamin A), vitamin C, and vitamin E, along with the mineral selenium. He recommends taking levels that are several times the RDA for these nutrients.<br />Cooper cites many scientific studies that show high does of these antioxidants reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. However, this book was originally published in 1994, and more recent studies have not given unqualified support to these earlier studies. In fact, more recent studies have been mixed.<br />Some studies do show that taking antioxidants reduce risk, but other studies show there is no effect. I summarize many of these studies in a chapter on supplements in my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\" My conclusion is that there is some evidence for the benefit of taking antioxidants, but it is not clear-cut as Cooper makes it out to be. There may or may not be any benefit to the practice.<br />Further clouding whether to take these supplements is the risk of side effects. Fortunately, Cooper does list possible side effects one might experience.<br />Another issue that Cooper does not address is the cost factor. Vitamin C is rather inexpensive and vitamin E and selenium moderately so, but beta-carotene tends to be rather expensive. And beta-carotene is the antioxidant with the least evidence supporting it.<br />Given the split evidence, I would say that if money is tight, one should spend their money on healthy food, not supplements. It is foods like fruits and vegetables that have unqualified evidence for their health benefits. And Cooper does include information on what foods are highest in the antioxidants and how best to prepare them to retain the nutrients. And my book provides further details on what foods help to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, and strokes.<br />As for myself, I have tried taking antioxidants in the amounts Cooper recommends, but I ended up with some of the side effects he mentions.

For each item, Cooper gives the following: Basic Nutritional Therapy, Extra Scientific Information, Special Food Sources, Therapy Recommendations, and Cross-References to related entries.<br />The information is presented in an easy to understand format. A table of context gives the page numbers for each entry. However, it is hard to find items by flipping though the pages as the publisher did not put identifying markers at the top of each page, like the item or letter covered on the page. So one has to keep turning pages to where the next entry begins to find out where in the alphabet you are. And flipping back and forth to the table of contents is tedious.<br />But these format problems aside, the information presented is rather good. Cooper provides sound recommendations on each of the items. And the scientific research given enables the reader to decide for yourself if Cooper's recommendations are correct. In fact, this research is so helpful that I cite some of it in my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\" I also have referred back to Cooper's book many times for personal information.<br />For instance, I have multiple allergies. And I have read in several \\"natural healing\\" sources that licorice is good for allergies. But I am glad I read Cooper's entry on licorice before trying it. He cites evidence that taking licorice for prolonged periods in the amounts I've seen recommended can raise one's blood pressure. As a result, Cooper recommends, \\"that everyone stay away from it\\" (p.273). And I think I will head this advice. I don't need high blood pressure on top of my allergies!	2001-04-21

And it is an excellent resource for the person wanting to get into shape. Cooper presents all the information one needs to get started and stay motivated.<br />What makes this book unique is the Christian orientation Cooper gives to fitness. He states, \\"... the belief required for a `fitness conversion' involves a conviction about your body and health that should be an outgrowth of your basic spiritual worldview\\" (p. 17).<br />So the faith that Cooper is referring to in the title is not just a belief in the importance of fitness but one that is an outgrowth of strong spiritual convictions. Such a faith would include the belief that the body is sacred and should be taken care of. He even includes a chapter of soul-searching questions for the reader to ask to determine your spiritual state as it relates to your health and suggestion for improving it.<br />The bulk of the book is occupied with giving specific workout schedules to follow for starting an exercise program. These include exercises for increasing ones level of endurance, flexibility, and strength.  Cooper outlines programs for walking, jogging, cycling (both outdoor and stationary bikes), and swimming. So the reader can choose what type of exercise most fits you and have a detailed routine to follow. If you stick with the routines you are sure to increase your level of fitness. And Cooper provides encouragements along the way to help you stay motivated. He even dispels some exercise myths that might discourage the budding exercise enthusiast.<br />I read this book at a time when I was really making an effort to get back into shape. I didn't follow the specific routines Cooper gives, but I did get many good ideas from reading this book. It gave me a standard by which to measure my fitness levels.

And as a Christian, I appreciate that he emphasizes that spiritual activities like prayer, Bible study, and attending worship services are ideal ways to deal with stress.<br />In regards to diet, he presents \\"bedrock principles\\" like eating more fruits and vegetables and reducing one's intake of fat. And he correctly points out that trans fat, found in hydrogenated oils, are the worst kind of fat. He doesn't go into too much detail in regards to diet in this book. But what he does give I tend agree with as I present similar information in much greater detail in my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\"<br />But it is in regards to supplements that I disagree with Cooper. He wholeheartedly recommends high doses of the antioxidant vitamins beta-carotene (the precursor to vitamin A), vitamin C, and vitamin E, along with the mineral selenium. He claims taking amounts several times the RDA helps to prevent heart disease and cancer. However, the evidence is not as clear-cut as Cooper makes it sound. I include a chapter in my book citing scientific studies in this regard. Some have shown a reduced risk from taking antioxidants, but other studies have shown no effect.<br />But that disagreement aside, this book does present helpful information for those of us who are starting to worry about our health and vitality as we age.clude a chapter in my book citing scientific studies in this regard.

However, there really is not that much that is \\"by the Book.\\" Throughout he presents a low-fat diet viewpoint that can been seen in many other nutrition books. He only discusses what the Bible teaches in the last of five parts and then only in regards to what the Bible teaches about meat consumption. However, what he does say here is worthwhile.<br />He first notes that the Bible restricts the eating of the fat of animals as much as it does the blood. Consuming blood is considered abhorrent today, and Meinz believes that the eating of animal fat should bring the same reaction. With all of the now know health problems associated with the eating of too much animal fat, God knew what He was doing when He told the Israelites not to eat it!<br />Next he presents his case that Christians today should observe the Old Testament distinction between clean and unclean animals, not for spiritual reasons but for health reasons. He gives a list of clean and unclean animals. He then notes, \\"Almost all of the creatures on the unclean list are scavengers\\" (p.225). It only seems logical that animals living on garbage would have higher levels of toxins in their bodies than ones living on plant foods. So again, there was a logical reason for God's original directive in this regard.<br />The information in this book is helpful, and I would recommend it. But the Bible has a lot more to say about nutrition and foods than just the two issues Meinz mentions. These other \\"by the Book\\" directives are discussed in my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\"	2001-04-19

Malkmus promotes his \\"Hallelujah Diet.\\" He bases his diet on Genesis 1:29. Rev. Malkmus believes this verse teaches that we should eat mostly raw plant foods, with most of the diet being raw fruits and vegetables.<br />It is true that raw fruits and vegetables are very healthy and that people need to eat more of these foods. And Malkmus does do a good job of pointing out the problems with the standard American diet. However, there are potential problems with the diet he advocates. First and foremost is that many people simply could not exist on such a diet as it supplies insufficient calories and nutrients.<br />For instance, Rev. Malkmus presents what he eats in the book (p.92). It is mostly raw fruits and vegetables, along with some cooked foods at dinner, such as a baked potato, brown rice, or whole grain pasta. He also takes several supplemental foods he advocates. Altogether his diet probably provides less than 1,000 calories.<br />Simply put I would starve following such a diet. I know as I did eat such a diet for a week as part of a \\"detox\\" routine. I lost five pounds and was ravishingly hungry by the end of the week. The detox was supposed to last ten days, but the hunger forced me to stop it after seven days.<br />Now I know that the idea of loosing five pounds in a week sounds great to many people, but such rapid weight loss is generally followed by just as rapid weight gain when one goes off of the diet. The only successful weight lose program is one that can be followed indefinitely. Such is not the case with such a restrictive diet. Following such a diet for a week can be good to \\"clean you out,\\" but to follow it indefinitely would simply be too difficult for many people.<br />There are also some serious gaffs in this book. The worst is the claim on page 245 that the body can manufacture vitamin B12 from green leafy vegetables and sea vegetables. It is true that some kinds of seaweeds contain vitamin B12, but such foods are not common in the US. And in no way can the body manufacture vitamin B12 in a form that is usable by the body. This is vastly important as a vitamin B12 deficiency can cause serious and irreversible nerve damage. Anyone following a strict vegetarian diet like Malkmus advocates MUST take a vitamin B12 supplement.<br />The overarching problem with Malkmus's book is he bases his entire diet on one verse of the Bible. Yet there is much else that the Bible has to state on the subject of nutrition and foods beyond this one verse. It is for this reason that I overview all of the relevant Bible verses in my book Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible. It presents an easier to follow alternative to Malkmus's type of diet.in the US. And in no way can the body manufacture vitamin B12 in a form that is usable by the body.

They are: \\"I: Eat only substances created for food. II: Eat foods as they were created. III: Don't let any food or drink become your god.\\" In the rest of the book he then elaborates on these three principles.<br />In regards to the first, he quotes verses where God specifically gives certain foods to human beings for food. He then presents a list of foods mentioned in the Bible. And later in the book he goes into further details on each of these foods and the health benefits science is now showing are associated with eating them. One point he dwells on is the distinction between clean and unclean meats.<br />He notes some of the health problems that have been caused by people eating unclean meats. He also includes an interesting chart of clean and unclean meats. Besides each kind of meat is an indication of it's toxicity level. All clean meats have much lower levels of toxins than unclean meats. However, these toxicity levels are taken from a study done in 1953. It would be helpful if a more recent study were cited.<br />In regards to the second principle, he first enlarges it beyond food to look at what God said about aspects of healthy living besides food. He notes that God's directives in regards to personal hygiene and sex give health benefits to the person following them. Then later he looks at foods. He notes that the processing of foods, such as turning whole grains into refined grains, \\"strips away\\" many of the nutrients God placed in the original whole foods.<br />In regards to principle III, he notes the many problems that addictions to food and other substances can cause a person.<br />Overall, this book is excellent. Russell presents a lot of Scripture verses and supporting scientific research for what the Bible teaches. It is similar to my book \\"Creationist Diet: Nutrition and God-given Foods According to the Bible.\\" Reading these two books together would give the reader a good grasp of what the Bible teaches about nutrition and how science is finally catching up to the Bible's teachings.the Bible teaches about nutrition and how science is finally catching up to the Bible's teachings.	2001-04-19
