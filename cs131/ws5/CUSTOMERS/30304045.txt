We each have our own personal roles in the story. It's up to us if we choose to play the part that was delegated to us. <br /> <br />This is the premise of John's Eldredge's Epic. We are all taking part in a tale of such awesome magnitude that is very difficult for us to fathom. However, each character and each role is just as important as any other. Our lives do have purpose. We are not borne out of random circumstances. We continue the tale that God has been writing since the beginning of time as we know it. <br /> <br />Epic is an excellent, although quite short, look at the importance of our lives and the roles each of us have been given in the greatest story ever told. He is very adept at illustrating his thesis using modern cultural references while proving how much of God's story had been written on our hearts ever since we were born. It is a great introduction to Eldredge's earlier work, \\"Waking The Dead,\\" where he goes into much greater detail on very similar topics.	2005-10-07

So, out of curiosity, I decided to read it for myself. I was presently surprised. It is not near as bad as others have made it out to be.  <br /> <br />This novel takes place right after Return Of The Jedi ends. The rebels have intercepted a desperate plea from an Imperial outpost on the planet of Bakura for immediate assistance in helping to repel some mysterious foreign invaders. Little does the Imperial outpost know that the Emperor has been defeated and that the rebels have won a major victory in the struggle against the crumbliung Empire. Han Solo and Leia Organa decide that they will lead a small task force to Bakura to help defend the planet from the invaders while, at the same time, try to see if they can get the Imperials there to agree to a truce. In the meantime, Luke Skywalker has been placed under medical observation for the injuries he sustained at the hand of the Emperor. However, Obi Wan Kenobi appears to Luke in a vision and stresses the importance of Luke joining the mission at Bakura or the fate of the galaxy may be at stake. So, Luke joins his friends for their expedition.  <br /> <br />Once on Bakura, the task force quickly becomes involved in a dangerous mission that may hold their very lives in the balance. The deadly reptilian invaders known as the Ssi-ruuk, do not want to simply kill their prey. Instead, they are capturing humans to transfer (or \\"entench\\") their souls into unstoppable droid-controlled machines to try and take over the universe. While developing a strategy to fight the invaders, Luke Skywalker senses a strong force-user among the Ssi-ruuk whom, if Luke can free from their grasp, may be able to turn him into a suitable apprentice for the new Jedi order. <br /> <br />This is an exciting edition to the Star Wars universe. Tyers does an excellent job of capturing the tone of the original trilogy and provides a great backdrop forfurther novels. Although it's not the best Star Wars novel I have ever read, it is definitely not the worst.	2005-09-28

Although not as good as Revenge, Shatterpoint is definitely a worthwhile read for any fan of the genre. <br /> <br />In this book, it is the time of the Clone Wars and the Republic is in chaos. Jedi Master Mace Windu (Samuel Jackson's character in the new movies), whom this story revolves around, receives a cryptic message from his former padawan, Depa Billaba. She is stationed on Mace's home-world of Haruun Kal to try and lead a resistance to the Seperatist army. However, something has horribly gone wrong. Depa has apparently turned to the dark side of the force and has committed unspeakable atrocities. Mace takes it upon himself to travel to Haruun Kal and find Depa. His mission is to either save her or, if necessary, bring her to justice. Mace is soon launched \\"head first\\" into a bloody confrontation in the jungles of Haruun Kal. Danger lies around every corner while Mace is forced to fight powerful foes in his search for the truth about Depa. However, his most dangerous enemy is the jungle itself. For it is a living entity of its own and very few ever walk out of it alive. <br /> <br />Although sometimes plagued with a slow pace, the book is still quite exciting most of the time. We learn a lot more about this mysterious jedi called Mace Windu who will later have a disastrous confrontation with Emporer Palpatine in Revenge of the Sith. We learn about his guilt concerning his actions at the battle of Geonosis (Attack of the Clones), his thoughts on the Clone Wars themselves, and also his true feelings toward the apparent hero Annakin Skywalker. All in all, this is a good book that is sure to be a pleasure to read for any Star Wars fan.	2005-09-21

So, I'm always excited and rarely dissapointed whenever he releases a new work. With Mammoth, Varley again proves why he is one of science-fiction's most celebrated writers. As is often done, comparing him to such pivital writers like Robert A. Heinlein is never a stretch by any means. <br /> <br />For this book, Varley once again tackles the subject of time travel (see Millennium). Although this subject has been exposed \\"to death\\" in science fiction, Varley looks at it with a fresh perspective that challenges as well as entertains. It's hard to put this book down once you begin to read it. <br /> <br />The story opens as a team of archaeologists and \\"scavengers,\\" hired by the eccentric billionaire Howard Christian, uncover a frozen mammoth that seems to be from the Ice Age. Along with the mammoth, a man is also found. However, there is something rather extraordinary about the man: he's wearing a very modern wristwatch. Also found is a briefcase-sized piece of equipment that Howard believes is some sort of a time machine. Howard quickly hires the best mathematician in the business to help him rebuild the machine. Soon, an adventure that can only be described as \\"mammoth\\" unfolds right before his very eyes.  <br /> <br />Seemingly predictable, the story is anything but. I was afraid I was going to be disappointed with how it all ended, but was pleasantly suprised when my assertions were disproved. Varley also lightens the mood within the story by taking some rather obvious \\"pot shots\\" at himself. This, itself, is probably worth the price of the book. Although, as usual, Varley deems it necessary to throw in the obligatory sex-scene, he once again proves that he's one of the most imaginative writers today. It's a shame that, when he's not writing, he now seems predisposed to mouth off about how \\"evil\\" the Bush administration is. For being such an intelligent writer, one would think he should be able tosee though all of that nonsense. Then again, some of the smartest people you'll ever meet have no common sense at all.	2005-08-16

After reading it, I definitely have a greater appreciation for the movie. I wish I had read the novel before seeing the movie. If I had, I think I would have liked the movie much better.    Unlike the movie, the novel goes deeper into the mind of Anakin Skywalker and leaves the reader with a greater understanding of his turn to the dark side of the force. Gone are the cheesiest lines of dialogue that plagued the movie and, in return, we are left with a thrilling adventure worthy of being called 'Star Wars.' The character and plot development that Stover conveys explain so much more than the movie does. Here, we find not only the struggles within Anakin Skywalker's mind, but also with the other Jedi such as Kenobi and Mace Windu. In this perilous time for the Republic, the Jedi try to solve the mystery of the Sith Lord that seems to have taken control of the senate while, at the same time, must struggle with the darkness that dwells within each of them. It's not only a war to save the Republic, but also a war within themselves that is the most intriguing aspect of the story. In his movie, Lucas was unable to convey this same depth to the characters that would have made it a masterpiece instead of a \\"so-so\\" escape into the world of Star Wars. Undoubtedly the most important chapter in the series, Lucas should have spent more time with his script or allowed a true writer, such as Stover, to pen it for him.    The only disappointing aspect to the novel is that Lucas' own inept political opinions are still present and leave the reader with a bad \\"after-taste\\" each time they present themselves. Other than that, this is a great novelization that sheds a lot more light onto the events of Revenge of the Sith.	2005-08-09

In the sixth chapter in the Harry Potter series, Rowling delivers another rousing adventure that is more emotionally charged than the previous books. Harry is now seventeen and in his sixth year at the Hogwarts school. The war between Voldamort and the wizarding community continues to rage on. Every day it seems as though there are rumours of attacks that bare the mark of the Death Eaters, Voldemort's close followers. Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore, along with Harry, sets upon the task of discovering Voldemort's mysterious history to try and find a weakness that might be used against him. Meanwhile, Harry and his friends have new challenges to tackle at school. Luckily, Harry finds some surprising help from a mysterious figure called the Half-Blood Prince. <br /> <br />Once again, Rowling creates another masterpiece full of mystery and suspense with a surprise ending that will leave the reader in awe. This is, by far, one of the best books that I've read this year. Rowling's imagination is only surpassed by a writing style that allows you to be completely lost within the story.	2005-08-02

Hated by the left (for challenging them) and adored by most of the right, Coulter is arguably one of the most controversial conservative pundits in America today. Why? Because she is a conservative woman that speaks her mind. She offers a \\"no-holds barred,\\" anti-political correctness response to the ever-increasing lunacy of the left's ideology. She is a voice of truth that breaks through the underlying liberal media bias so obviously prevalent in today's society. Coulter, along with a few other conservative intellectuals, have opened the door to conservative thought in a way that has never been allowed due to the aggressive and antagonistic monopolies that the liberal media have enjoyed for many years. Now, however, there is a more even \\"playing field\\" with more and more conservative apologists breaking into the mainstream every day.  <br /> <br />This current book is a collection of Coulter's most challenging editorials and a few that were never published due to the lack of \\"backbone\\" some publishers exhibited. Coulter takes on such \\"hot-button\\" issues as abortion, gun control, education and much more. As well as insights into her personal life (no, she's not the cold-hearted witch that the left tries to paint her as). Her well-informed arguments leave little, if any, room for questioning.  <br /> <br />This is an excellent book that should be read by all (even liberals, if they aren't afraid of being enlightened). It's a shame that most of the Republicans in political office don't take after Coulter's example speaking truth whether or not it \\"reaches out\\" to the other side. If they did, we'd see a lot more progress in America today. Instead, they're so afraid being thought of as \\"mean-spirited,\\" that they often compromise their beliefs instead of standing up for them. Liberals never compromise nor do they offer their hands in a spirit of compassion towards us. So, why should we when it comes to our principles?	2005-07-27

Taken from a series of conversations with journalist and friend Michka Assayas, this is a heartfelt look into the life of one of rock music's biggest and outspoken artists. As the front man for the group U2, Bono is often seen as the spokesperson for not only the band istelf, but also for various causes he has undertaken such as debt relief and AIDS awareness. Through these conversations, he reveals how he got involved in these causes and others that are so close to his heart. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I have a lot more respect for Bono than I did. His candidness about the causes he supports and also his strong Christian belief is refreshing in this day and age of self-loathing and hatred of Christianity. Bono never backs down whenever asked about his belief in God and, in turn, practically witnesses to Assayas.  <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the moments when Bono talks about his relationship with the rest of the members of U2. It really opens your eyes to what is going on behind the music of these great musicians. The way they relate to each other as family is definitely what has kept this band going for many years. <br /> <br />The only problem I have with this book is Assayas, himself. Some of the questions he asks are rather dumb. Fortunately, Bono is able to turn them around into something worthwhile. Assayas apparently has been a journalist and writer for quite some time, but this book makes it seem like he's a novice.	2005-06-08

This time, he tackles the story of Snow White. In it, he intertwines the history of the infamous Borgia family to create a story that, at times, seems to be based on some historical facts even though it's still a work of fiction.  <br /> <br />The story takes place in 16th Century Italy where turmoil and mystery surrounds the land. Bianca De Nevada (Snow White) is a motherless child being raised by her father on their farm of Montefiore. While still young, Cesare Borgia along with his sister, Lucrezia, pay a visit to Monetfiore to blackmail Bianca's father into setting out on a sacred quest for them. While he is to be away on the quest, Lucrezia promises to look after the girl. Grudgingly, Bianca's father leaves for it is the only way to keep his child safe (or so he thinks at the time). <br /> <br />After a few years pass, Lucrezia develops an extreme jealousy of Bianca and sets out to have her murdered. Just like in the classic fairy-tale, Bianca escapes and is taken in by the dwarfs. However, these are not the cute dwarfs from Disney's classic film. They may or may not even be human. They soon, begrudgingly, attach themselves to Bianca and she to them. Once Lucrezia finds out that Bianca is still alive (thanks to a certain mirror), she tries numerous times to kill her again. However, this fairy-tale doesn't end with the handsome prince awakening Snow White to they live happily ever after. \\"Happily ever after\\" is generally not a phrase one should give to the end of Maguire's books. <br /> <br />I loved Wicked and Confessions, but I found this book to be rather \\"flat.\\" It was very drawn out and boring at times. The premise behind the story is interesting, but it had a hard time holding my attention. There were numerous times when I thought about not finishing the book. It was definitely a disappointment considering how much I liked Maguire's earlier books.	2005-02-14

Ever since Jumper, Gould's novels have become less and less interesting with each work that has been published. However, Reflex is a welcome return to the type of writing that heralded Gould as great novelist with a bright future in science-fiction. <br /> <br />In this sequel, teleporter David Rice is now married and living comfortably out of the public's eye. Every once in a while, he is hired by the NSA (National Security Agency) to do \\"favors\\" for them (i.e. - rescuing hostages, dropping off \\"packages\\", etc.). Little does he know, that there is a sinister group of people that are planning to kidnap him and force him to do tasks that would ensure their power throughout the world. Furthermore, they've developed a technology that would be able to keep David well within their reach. <br /> <br />Little do they know, however, is that David's wife, Millie, can also teleport now. Once David goes \\"missing,\\" Millie makes it her undying quest to find him and put an end to the devilish plot that unfolds. <br /> <br />This is an excellent and exciting book from Gould. Even though teleportation has been covered ad-nauseum in so many other sci-fi books and movies, Gould brings a fresh new perspective to the concept that is both intriguing and thought provoking. After I finished reading this book, I wanted the story to continue.	2005-01-18

It is probably one of my favorite science-fiction novels... <br /> <br />17 year-old David Rice discovers he has a unique talent. He is able to teleport himself to anywhere just by using his mind. He first discovers his ability one night when his alcoholic father staggers into the house ready to give David his usual beating. David, without realizing it, teleports himself to a local library before his father can throw the first punch. After teleporting a few more times, David learns to control his new ability and sets out to make it on his own. In the process, he moves to New York and robs a bank by teleporting into the vault after hours. <br /> <br />Guilt soon plagues him and, not wanting to use his ability for crime, he decides that he will no longer allow his talent to turn him into a criminal. Soon, he finds a girl that he falls in love with and they begin a long-lasting relationship. However, David is scared that he might chase her away if he tells her the truth about himself. <br /> <br />Through an incident involving the death of his mother, David becomes involved in rescuing hijacking victims. However, the U.S. National Security Agency is now aware of David's unique ability and will do anything to capture him and use his power for their own agendas.  <br /> <br />Gould's story has you \\"glued\\" from page one and doesn't let up until the thrilling conclusion. This little review really doesn't do the novel much justice. This is a great book that allows you to escape into a story that feels like it could be reality.	2005-01-04

They were the heroes of old, men of renown.\\" ~ Genesis 6:4 (NIV) <br /> <br />\\"We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.\\" ~ Numbers 13:33 (NIV) <br /> <br />In this fantastic tale that blends science-fiction and Biblical fact, Elwood creates a story that is not only entertaining, but also very thought-provoking. The author takes the mystery of the ancient Biblical race called the Nephilim and tries to theorize who these remarkable people were and what they would be like if they were alive today. Were they really a sinister plot by Satan to create his own race to control or something much more? If they are, in fact, born of demons, then do they have souls that can be saved by the blood of Christ or are they doomed to a state of oblivion after death? <br /> <br />The story follows the adventures of a modern-day pastor who, while running away from his own past, is forced into interaction with these mysterious creatures that are now called \\"Dwellers.\\" In no time at all, Rev. Kindred becomes a strong ally to the creatures and learns a great deal of their long and tragic history. He is shown many wonders of the world that no human has ever seen. However, the most profound and disturbing revelation that Rev. Kindred learns is the fact the the Dwellers do not believe they have souls that can be saved since they do not believe they were totally born of God. How could creatures that are so human-like and, in many ways, more advanced not have the opportunity to know the saving grace of Jesus Christ? This is one of the questions that Kindred is determined to resolve. However, there is a sinister side of the Dwellers that could explode at any time if Kindred is not careful. <br /> <br />I've read this book a couple of times and it's still amazingly \\"fresh.\\" Elwood has a way of writing that takes you into another world and leaves you wanting more when you're done. My only complaint is that the ending was a little strange. The epilogue didn't really make much sense and the story itself kind of left you hanging. Once again, however, it's a shame that this book went out of print so quickly. It's a very important book that should have gotten much more credit than it did when it was first printed.	2004-12-07

This time, Hannity takes on the current struggle against evil that is so important for America to face \\"head-on\\" in order to remain the outpost for freedom that it represents.  <br /> <br />More of a history lesson than an outright political manifesto, Hannity compares our current struggles against terrorism with that of the Cold War and other important struggles America has faced. He well-documents how the radical left in this country and elsewhere have always tried to undermine our fight against evil for their own political aspirations. Instead of standing behind our leaders in times of great struggle, they instead act with a moral ambiguity that makes them just as dangerous as the enemies we face on the battlefield. To them we are the problem, not those that would destroy us.  <br /> <br />In one of the most poignant chapters, Hannity recounts how the same people in the country that are trying to destroy President Bush are the same ones that greatly opposed Reagan when confronting the Soviet Union (i.e. - John Kerry). They used the same ridiculous arguments then as they do now. Yet, history has showed him to be one of the greatest presidents ever to lead America. When he recently passed away, these same democrats praised Reagan's leadership. Do they know no shame? They are so obviously interested in only their own political gain rather than protecting America. <br /> <br />Hannity also makes a strong historical case on why it was important for us to invade Iraq and how President Bush has stepped up to the great challenge of protecting America and its interests. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great book that should be on everyone's bookshelf. It is one of the most important books one can read going into this upcoming election. Read it and learn the truth.	2004-10-25

Unlike his first two books, this one was quite boring and just seemed to drag on and on. More of a military strategy novel than science-fiction, the story opens strong and then just develops into a long-winded tale about a young man's \\"journey\\" into manhood. Not until the very end of the book does it really get interesting again. If you can hold out that long, the end holds a pretty interesting plot twist.    The premise of the story is as follows: in the future, earth has been decimated to the point that it can no longer sustain life. Therefore, a group of scientists set out to colonize a new planet. Along with the colonists, the send along glass helms that contain the knowledge that living centuries on earth have provided them. However, there are specific dangers to those that wear the helms. Some colonists set out to destroy the helms and proceed to set up colonies that are essentially anti-technology. Only one helm remains in a specific village on top of the tallest mountain in the region.    Fast forward to many more years in the future. Earth is just a legend now. Many colonies have been set up on the new planet and wars break out every so often between the colonies for land occupation and control. The last helm is still on the mountain, but it's been forbidden for anyone to wear it. However, one boy defies the order and sets out to conquer the mountain and wear the helm. This throws into motion a series of events that wil forever change the boys life. Centuries of knowledge are suddenly implanted into his mind and now he must learn how to control it before it controls him.    This sounds like a great premise for a story. However, it quickly becomes \\"bogged\\" down in a boring tale that makes it quite hard to even want to finish the novel.	2004-10-18

So, the job of the grim reaper is bestowed upon his adopted granddaughter, Susan. At the same time, Imp The Bard has just bought an enchanted guitar in a music shop. Little does he know that the guitar holds a powerful secret that could mean the end of the universe. When Susan and Imp cross paths, it seams that both of their worlds are thrown into chaos. It's up to Susan to figure out the secret behind the enchanted guitar before a catastrophe occurs that even Death himself couldn't fix.<br /><br />Once again, Pratchett proves he's a genius at writing satire. Each book he releases seems to be better than the one before. Soul Music is no exception. Along with a plethora of new characters, the usual suspects are still there. Including the inept wizards of Unseen University who add even more hilarity to this extremely funny story. The only problem with any of Pratchett's Discworld books is that you have to read them in some kind of order to remotely understand what is really going on. This is difficult due to the fact that there are now over 40 books in the series and Pratchet doesn't write them in any useful order (or so it seems). However, you can find some good reading \\"guides\\" on the internet from time to time to help you in your journey through the Discworld. Believe me, it's worth the effort.	2004-09-20

For a while, in the '90's, he consistently released several titles that garnered critical acclaim. Unfortunately, he's not as a prolific writer as he used to be. I first read The Wandering in 1990. It immediately became one of my favorites. Every once in a while, I'll read it again. I get something new out of it each time I read it. <br /> <br />The story takes place in the far future (or does it?). Neshi, an elite tech detective on a distant planet, is haunted by a ghoulish nightmare whenever he sleeps. Little does he know that the \\"nightmare\\" is actually prophetic. While working on a case involving a mad \\"hunchback\\" that has been killing people in his sector, Neshi uncovers a government plot that will effectively be the end of civilization on his planet unless he can do something to stop it. Neshi soon discovers that the government on his planet is controlled by a sinister group of \\"beings\\" called the Natasians. It is the Natasians' one goal to conquer humankind and devoid it of all hope. Neshi is soon chosen as the leader of an underground rebellion that attempts to overthrow the evil Natasians. However, the Natasians are not of \\"flesh and blood\\" and not be so easily defeated. They soon banish Neshi from his home planet to a lifetime of wandering aimlessly throughout the galaxy. <br /> <br />Try as he might, Neshi cannot find another planet that hasn't been somehow influenced by the Natasians' plans for total domination throughout the universe. Neshi finally settles on a world called Nede that seems to be the place that he has been looking for all along. Everything \\"seems\\" perfect on the planet. However, Neshi soon finds out that even in this \\"paradise,\\" the Natasians have complete control. Once again, he sets out, with some new allies, to find a place where he can live in peace without having to succumb to the Natasians' control. <br /> <br />More than just a science-fiction story, The Wandering is a modern fable for our times that teaches how evil gains a stronghold within every asset of life in order to try and distinguish it. However, more importantly, it also teaches of the incredible grace and love of God that can permeate the darkness in any circumstance if we just allow Him to take control of our lives. This is a story of hope and of redemption for the human race.  <br /> <br />It's a shame that this book went out-of-print so quickly after it was published. If promoted correctly, it could have had a valuable influence on the science-fiction community and within Christian literature. Even though it's out-of-print, you can still find used copies of it for sale from time to time. The last time I checked, Amazon.com had quite a few used copies available for purchase. <br /> <br />On a side-note, I once met the author, Roger Elwood, and he told me that this book was only half of the story. In fact, his book Dwellers was written in conjunction with The Wandering and they were supposed to be released as one. This is pretty fascinating since both stories, even though they contain some of the same \\"themes,\\" are very different from each other. I would love to have read the original version of these stories to see how they fit together.	2004-09-13

Her consistency in her writing continues to amaze. The longest book so far, The Order Of The Phoenix captures your attention in the very first chapter and doesn't let up. The dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, has returned to power and continues to gather his followers for a second war in the wizarding world. Meanwhile, Harry is haunted with the same dreams over and over. He's sure that they must mean something important. Harry is also beginning adolescence and is trying to deal with everything that it entails (at least, as much as the famous boy wizard can do).  <br /> <br />At school, the Ministry Of Magic is trying to take over and has positioned one of its own as the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher. Consistently antagonizing the headmaster, Dulmbledore, the Ministry refuses to believe his or Harry's story about the return of Lord Voldemort. So, it's up to them and a small group of wizards called The Order Of The Phoenix to shine the light of truth on the wizarding world while at the same time try to stop whatever plans Voldemort is concocting. <br /> <br />Although not my favorite Harry Potter book, it's still a great read. The first half of the book is rather tedious, though. Harry, in the middle of adolescence, is constantly in a \\"sulking\\" mood and yelling at everyone he comes into contact with. Personally, I see enough pre-teens whining all of the time about how no one understands them and how they never get what they want. I don't need to read it in a story as well. Besides that, Rowling's trademark sense of humor is also lacking in the first half of the book. <br /> <br />The second half of the book, however, is another story-telling masterpiece. As with her other books, its hard to put this one down once you start reading it. Once it's over, you still want it to continue.	2004-08-31

The adventure continues as Harry proceeds to attend his fourth year at the Hogwarts school. Once again, mysterious events keep happening around Harry that seem to promote the inevitable return of his arch nemesis, Lord Voldemort. Harry is forced into a tri-wizard tournament that hasn't happened for many years. Competing schools will test their best against Harry in this dangerous and thrilling contest. Meanwhile, hints about Voldemort's return keep \\"turning up\\" while his faithful followers, the Death Eaters, start raising havoc. A sinister plot thickens as Harry comes to realize that he may have been forced into the tournament by one of these dark wizards. Can Harry and his friends, Ron & Hermione, figure out the mysteries behind the tri-wizard tournament before it's too late?<br /><br />Once again, Rowling provides a fantastic entry to the Harry Potter saga. Her books keep getting better with each release. With each book, the story takes on a darker premise, but Rowling always keeps her sense of humor \\"in check.\\" Even though the book is an incredible 734 pages long, it never seems to \\"drag.\\" I quickly read through this book, always wanting to see what happened on the next page. It has definitely made me look forward to reading the next book in the series, Harry Potter and the Order Of The Phoenix.	2004-08-26

My main complaint about this book is that most of the sections are not very elaborate and only deal with one or two quotes from a particular person. This can hardly be evidence of that person's genuine beliefs. I think the author tries to read too much into what some of them say. <br /> <br />Still, it does make for a very worthwhile read. The author offers many counter-arguments to some of the more outspoken artists' statements toward Christianity in particular. He has a keen understanding of the Christian faith and offers insightful apologetic antidotes. This is especially a worthwhile read if you're interested in knowing the basics of the Christian faith and how it is most often reflected in today's modern popular culture.	2004-08-23

Then, with the recent movie, my interest was peaked once again. <br /> <br />I knew that the book was supposed to be totally different from the movie, so I wasn't surprised at that revelation while reading it. The movie is merely suggested by the book. The only things that remain in tact are some of the character names and, of course, the \\"three laws of robotics.\\" <br /> <br />I, Robot is a series of short stories as told from the point of view of robo-psychologist, Susan Calvin. She's seen it all... from the first robots that couldn't speak to the \\"Machines\\" that essentially control the world today. Each story revolves around the \\"three laws of robotics:\\" <br /> <br />1 - A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  <br />2 - A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  <br />3 - A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  <br /> <br />These three laws set up some very interesting scenarios involving robots from all walks of life. Here we meet nursemaid robots, politician robots, robots with senses of humor and other machines that are often more life-like than their human counterparts. According to the \\"three laws,\\" the main goal of each robot is further the interests of the human race. Or is it? Can the laws be broken? If so, what is the danger in it? These are come of the questions raised by Asimov in these stories. <br /> <br />Asimov is most famous for combining science-fact with his science-fiction stories. This tale is no exception. He had a keen understanding of modern technology as well as what the future of technology holds. It's quite amazing that this book was written in 1950. He was definitely ahead of his time. However, his keen observance of the science-fact aspect of his stories often weigh down the entertainment value. It often makes the stories uninteresting at times. Still, this is a very worthwhile read if you're interested in this kind of science-fiction writing. Asimov is considered one of the \\"fathers\\" of science-fiction writing and rightly so.	2004-08-10

She uncovers the liberal elites' true agenda (anti-Americanism) by offering irrefutable evidence. Focusing mainly on the elites in Hollywood, The U.N. and politics, she delves deep into the current trend of their hatred of American values and exposes the myths that they so heavily promote. Although a bit slow in the first couple of chapters, the book quickly picks up pace and it's hard to put it down. <br />  <br /> Ingraham has extensive knowledge of the workings in the elites' &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; mindset that seems to be so prevalent today. This is especially noticeable in her chapter on the U.N. She exposes how this &quot;elite haven&quot; was once a noble organization, but has become just another in a long line of liberal agenda-driven &quot;clubs&quot; led by incompetent and America-hating leaders.  <br />  <br /> This is a great book for anyone that would like to know why these &quot;elites&quot; hate American values so much and what our response to them should be. Unlike some authors, Ingraham doesn't just expose the elite hate-mongers for what they are, she also provides intelligent analysis as to how we should combat their ridiculous motions of anti-Americanism. <br />  <br /> Don't pay attention to the one-line negative reviews that have been posted. Those reviewers obviously never read the book or they are so brainwashed that they can't see truth when it's right in front of their eyes.	2004-08-03

If you're interested in learning the history of various cults and how their teachings relate to the Bible, then do yourself a favor and pick this up. It is definitely intended for the Christian reader so it's sure to offend those that hold the view that Christianity is not the one true faith or those that are involved in any of the cults mentioned. I assume that those that have given this book negative reviews probably fall into one, if not both, of those categories. Unfortunately, they continue to blind themselves to truth.<br />I do suggest that, after reading this book, the reader should do his/her own research into the validity of Matin's claims. Especially in the case of each cults' &quot;history.&quot; I think you'll find that he &quot;hits the nail on the head.&quot; The facts he gives are irrefutable although the cult revisionists still fail to see past their own blind obedience brought about by ignorance. For example, if most Mormons would actually do their own research into their &quot;religion,&quot; they would find so many  ridiculous errors in their own &quot;theology&quot; that they would surely denounce their &quot;faith.&quot; But alas, they choose to blindly follow the leadership of their &quot;prophets&quot; instead. Even the negative reviewers here that have tried to come up with rebuttals to what is mentioned in this book fall short of the necessary evidence to refute the facts mentioned within (trust me, I've read them all).<br />Anyway, this is an excellent book for any Christian to purchase and one worthy to keep on your bookshelf as a valuable resource that you'll return to again and again.	2004-07-02

The novel's hero, Richard Mayhew, is a simple man with a simple life until one day he sees a bleeding girl lying in an alley. The choice he makes to help the girl opens a whole new world to him. The very next day, Richard's life, as he knows it, has drastically changed. No one seems to know who he is. All records of his life have disappeared. His only hope is to find the girl (called Door) again and see if she can offer any explanations on why his world has turned upside down. His search for the girl leads him to a whole underground world beneath modern London where nothing is at it seems.<br />This novel was much better than I anticipated.

Partly because I think the authors take liberties with Scripture that are really disconcerting at times (this is especially true with end-times fiction) and partly because I've found that a lot of the Christian authors are just not very good writers. However, the topic of this particular book was just too intriguing for me to pass up. In the end, I was pleasantly surprised. <br />In this first part of his Chronicles Of The Host series, Schafer speculates as to what might have happened in heaven at the time of Satan's demise and subsequent exile from heaven. How exactly did Lucifer come to challenge God? How was he able to get a third of the hosts of heaven to join him? What is heaven like for angels? What exactly was Lucifer thinking? These are questions that Schafer tries to discuss in this splendid narrative. <br />The story is well written and the characters are well developed. Not only do you get a glimpse into Lucifer's &quot;thinking,&quot; but you also understand more of the angels' relationships to God and each other. <br />The story begins around the time that Lucifer may have started getting the idea of overthrowing heaven and the subsequent political turmoil that ensues. It ends with the fall of man and the promise of a new hope from God. <br />All in all, this was a very entertaining and a thought-provoking read. I look forward to reading the rest of the novels in this series. I just hope that people who read them take into account that this is fiction and speculation. It should not be taken too literally. I think that people sometimes get Christian fiction confused with the realities of Scripture.	2004-04-27

As he did in his excellent novel, &quot;Wicked,&quot; Maguire once again takes a familiar fairy tale and rearranges our preconceived notions on a story that has been handed down from generation to generation. This time, Maguire uses the tale of Cinderella as a backdrop to the eternal question, &quot;is beauty really in the eye of the beholder and who decides what is truly beautiful?&quot; <br />The story takes place in Holland and revolves mainly around one of Cinderella's stepsisters, Iris. Maguire develops a &quot;back-story&quot; that discloses the odd circumstances in which the young girls first become acquaintances and then family. The family is plagued with misfortune primarily due to the overbearing mentality of Iris' mother, Margarethe. She is driven to extremes to try and satisfy her own cravings for wealth and importance in the community.<br />Iris, who has an eye for art, is portrayed as the only family member capable of of &quot;keeping things together.&quot; Her maternal sister, Ruth, is awkward and has the mind of a child. As for Cinderella, she is a spoiled rich girl that has never learned how to care for herself and has much growing up to do.<br />In Maguire's tale, the step sisters are not the evil villains they've been made out to be and Cinderella, or Clara as she is called, is not the perfect &quot;catch&quot; even though her bewitching beauty is unchallenged. The mother, on the other hand, does have an evil persona to her character. However, Maguire offers insights into her personality and experiences that have made her that way.<br />This is an excellent book. My short description doesn't really do it any justice. Although I didn't like it as much as &quot;Wicked,&quot; it was still a very worthwhile read.	2004-04-20

It is one of the most thought-provoking books on political philosphy that I have read in quite some time. Everyone, no matter what your political leanings are, should read this book. For liberals, it will give you an honest look at how conservatives think and why. For conservatives, it reinforces your beliefs and arms you with new ammunition and inspiration in the ongoing war against the liberal plague. Hannity offers point-by-point factual arguments that totally dismiss the most common liberal rhetoric. He also has a very keen understanding of how the liberal mind works. <br />Topics he covers includes abortion, taxes, military, patriotism, school choice, racism and a plethora of other subjects ripped from today's headlines. One of my favorite chapters is the one in which he deals with abortion (entitled &quot;I'm Pro-Choice&quot;). He totally destroys the Left's mantra that Pro-Choice does not equal Pro-Abortion. <br />Even if you don't read the whole thing, at least go into a bookstore and read the last chapter entitled &quot;What Matters Most.&quot; The encouraging words that Hannity offers in this last chapter is worth the price of the book itself.<br />---<br />On a side note, don't pay any attention to any of the one-liner or sarcastic reviews that have been posted about this book. The authors of those reviews have obviously not even read the book and don't intend to. I find it very interesting the choices that Amazon makes when deciding to post reviews.

Murray, son of the infamous atheist Madelyn Murray O'Hair who successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to take prayer out of the public schools in 1963. If you don't know, William Murray at age 33 accepted Christ into his life. This is his harrowing and very sad story of growing up in a household with &quot;evil personified&quot;, as he puts it in one part in his book.<br />This was a very interesting story. He goes into great detail about the &quot;mommy dearest&quot; relationship that he had with Madelyn and her love affair with socialist and communist causes and her outright hatred for Christianity. As sad and hopeless as the story constantly seems, it has a great ending. Now, an outspoken activist for Christian causes, William Murray has &quot;exercised&quot; his demons and now lives in the glory of Christ.<br />The only disappointing aspect of the book is that it was written in 1982. As most people know, the saga of Madelyn O'Hair had a very tragic ending. I would like for William to do an updated version of this book and include information regarding the subsequent murder of his mother, brother and his first daughter.	2004-04-03

It's Maguire theory that the witch (named Elphalba) wasn't really the wicked person that The Wizard Of Oz portrayed her to be. Instead, Maguire proposes the idea that she was a victim of circumstance and political espionage. <br />Though slow at times, this is one of the most imaginative books that I've read in a very long time. It is often very humorous (Elphalba was once the college roomate and good friend of Glinda the Good Witch!). Throughout the satire, Maguire also contemplates on nature of evil. This is adult fantasy at it's finest (definitely not a child's fairy tale). After reading this, I don't think I'll ever look at The Wizard Of Oz the same way again.	2004-03-15

I really tried to read this book with an open mind as I have also read Goldberg's book. I wanted to hear the other side of the story as well. However, it became too humorous to do so. It's as if Alterman is so blind that he can't see past his own agenda. Media bias is so obvious that it's hard to comprehend how anyone could take this book too seriously. Of course he's going to argue that it's not liberally biased: he's a liberal himself! That's one of the reasons that I found Goldberg's book much more reliable. Goldberg is also a liberal, but he is also very honest about the liberal bias in the media. <br />In the end, however, I suppose these types of books are very subjective. Subconsiously, can anyone one of us really have an opened mind on a particular subject? I think that most of the time, we have already made up our minds as to what we are going to believe. Being a conservative at heart, I am prone to think more conservatively on political issues. Whereas, someone with a more liberal leaning may come away with a totally different impression on the same book. It's what makes for an interesting world. Thank God, we're not all alike.	2004-02-28

I can imagine him sitting at his typewriter and consulting a thesaurus with each sentence he writes. It's as though his ego needs to try and prove how intelligent he is to the reader. However, he comes across as bombastic and boring. There were many times that I almost gave up on finishing the novel because it was lulling me to sleep.<br />I won't go into the details of the story since so many other reviews have already done that. However, I will recommend that you pass this book up. At least, check it out from the library and don't waste your money.	2004-02-21

It has it's humorous moments, but it's not as humorous as it has been made out to be in other reviews.<br />What I found most humorous were the arguments that Morrow puts forth throughout the narrative. They are the same lame arguments that atheists have been using for centuries to try and discount the existence of a good God. The arguments fall &quot;flat&quot; and are so easily discounted. Also, I found it hilarious that Morrow thinks He could write about what the mind of God is like. That kind of speculation has got to be some of the best science-fiction ever penned. He spends so much time deluding himself into thinking that He knows what God is thinking.<br />Also, Morrow must have some infactuation with trying to prove C.S. Lewis wrong. It's too bad Lewis is not alive today to be able to join Morrow in this debate. Morrow would soon find out that he is way out of his league.<br />One thing I always find very interesting is that atheists claim to not believe in God, and yet they are always shaking their fists at Him. Doesn't this contradict themselves? <br />All in all, the book is a very entertaining look at the atheists' mind through narrative.  However, I don't think that was what the writer's motive was. Yes, he comes off as arrogant and self-righteous and he misses the Truth entirely.	2004-01-30

No, it's not as &quot;in depth&quot; as most of Pratchett's books and it is quite short. However, I found this to be very refreshing. It was a nice change of pace from the other Discworld stories. It is a great &quot;light&quot; read and a good story.	2004-01-10

The only readers that would be offended by this book are the media &quot;elite&quot; themselves or those that prefer a liberal media. The reviewers that have given this book low ratings because they believe it to be &quot;liberal bashing&quot; are not being honest with themselves or you. Of course, that is what you'd expect from a liberal.	2004-01-04
