While the format other reviewers talk about in a book called \\"Exit Authority,\\" listing the exits by complete expressway rather than by state, would probably be more useful, \\"Exit Authority\\" is out of print, but THE NEXT EXIT is available. If you are traveling I-95 or I-75 (except in Florida, which is skipped in both books), I recommend the individual books written for these freeways. Otherwise THE NEXT EXIT is a serviceable and useful tool for your trip along with a good road atlas. Even if all the gas stations and restaurants at each exit are not precisely accurate, the book will give you a good idea of which exits have many services and which have only one or two choices, giving you a chance to plan accordingly. It would probably cost more, but it would be nice if the publishers could print different services in different color inks, perhaps black for gas stations, blue for hotels, red for restaurants, etc. to differentiate. However, I believe THE NEXT EXIT will be useful on your next trip.	2005-09-28

Now living at the Kings' home as cherished members of the family, the children, especially Polly, make the acquaintance of the unpleasant cousin Eunice Chatterton, who thinks the Kings are \\"slumming\\" by associating with the Peppers. She hopes at least to turn Polly into a willing servant to her, then decides to train little Phronsie instead. This is a very typical Victorian novel and your enjoyment will depend on how you tolerate the usual Victorian children's book excesses: the children exclaim with joy, have \\"rhapsodies,\\" and cry at the drop of a hat. And although Phronise is now about eight years old in this story, she still talks as if she is the little baby of the original book. Still, it is fascinating to read about the way Victorian children lived and amused themselves, and even about differing attitudes to what are today simple accidents: in one part of the story, young Dick Whitney breaks his leg, and you might think from the reaction that the little boy is on the verge of death, until you realize that in those days a broken leg might cause blood poisoning or infection leading to death.	2005-05-31

And the youngest girl is sometimes too absolutely cute for words. But the novel itself is an excellent portrait of the average life of a poor family in the late 1800s and it is very much a typical Victorian children's story, complete with the family's rescue at the end. Widow Mary Pepper and her five children eke out a meager existence living on the proceeds of her sewing jobs. But the five children, Ben, Polly, Joel, David and Phronsie, are happy, mostly healthy, and make the most of what they have even if they must eat potatoes, mush and molasses most of the time. Then a chance encounter with a wealthy boy and his dog change their lives.<br /><br />I would take off one point for this Charming Classics edition by pointing out the cover: why are there six kids? The book is FIVE little Peppers; who's the extra girl in front on the left?	2005-05-31

WHAT KATY DID is the lively story of Katherine Carr, the eldest of six children-the others are Clover, Elsie, Dorry (a boy), Johnnie (Joanna, a girl), and Phil. Her father, Dr. Carr, doesn't mind Katy being lively and adventurous, but she is also heedless, untidy, and sometimes unkind to her siblings and doesn't care about the work she causes her Aunt Izzie, who cares for the motherless brood. Katy's days are full of \\"scrapes\\" like playing \\"the game of the Rivers\\" at school and the hide-and-seek game in the dark, Kikeri, until she is involved in a terrible accident. From there she must learn to rebuild her life; she is helped by Cousin Helen, who has not let the paralysis of her legs affect her mind or her heart. While it is true that Katy is \\"tamed\\" by her accident, she eventually still remains the innovative,  fun-loving girl she was before. The chapter about Katy's Christmas and Valentine's Day plans, especially the latter, make you wish we celebrated the holidays the way they did 100 years ago!<br /><br />This is a great book-for a long time I liked it much better than LITTLE WOMEN-because Katy is even more lively and ingenious than Jo March. The sequels are also good, especially the first.<br /><br />There are four sequels to KATY, only two of which are in print, sadly. WHAT KATY DID AT SCHOOL follows Katy's and Clover's adventures at Hillsover, a boarding school in the East. Here they meet one of the KATY books most memorable characters, the mischievous \\"Rose Red\\" who makes their year's stay lively, to say the least. The girls play wonderful games in their spare time, including something called \\"Word and Question\\" that sounds like great fun, and Katy even \\"tames\\" Miss Jane, the humorless hall monitor, and lives down an accusation. Here we meet the Carrs' cousins the Pages, Olivia and her husband and children, the selfish Lilly, who's at school with the girls, and Clarence, a teasing boy who takes a shine to Clover.<br /><br />In WHAT KATY DID NEXT, Katy accompanies her neighbor Mrs. Ashe and her daughter Amy on \\"the Grand Tour\\" of Europe. This is a wonderful portrait of how people traveled to England, France, Italy, and other European countries 100 years ago. It also paints a not-so-pleasant picture of a time when many diseases were rife, and of all the troubles Katy has when Amy comes down with \\"Roman fever\\" (typhoid, I believe).

It is there Clover realizes Clarence would like their old friendship to be something more.<br /><br />IN THE HIGH VALLEY is the fifth and last title in the sequence. In this story, Geoffrey's brother Lionel and sister Imogen come to live at the ranch with him.

And it's what it turns out to be for the Preston family: dad John, mother Molly, 12-year-old Dick, 8-year-old Janet, and Gran, who start out from their \\"shining modern apartment\\" one day in June 1941 on vacation and end up, through Gran's innocent machinations, buying a rundown farm in upstate New York. Gran's determined to keep the farm and the rest of the family respond to the challenge by turning the decrepit place into a beautiful place to live and work. In doing so they befriend an elderly couple and their grandson, a talented artist, whose lives are changed by the Prestons.<br /><br />This is a charming novel in which Seredy again promotes life on the farm, and threads about belonging, home, and the diversity of American life are wound tenderly through it. Although she doesn't sugarcoat the hard work the Prestons must do to bring the farm to life, she makes it so appealing that you will want to buy a farm yourself to see if you can recreate the joy the family finds in simple living. Although the news of Pearl Harbor strikes a blow to all involved (especially a Polish couple farming nearby), the beautiful ending of this story will have you misty-eyed.	2005-05-12

His parents are Hungarian nobility and his days are full of magic, from the stories of his beloved \\"Nana\\" to riding lessons. But it is World War II and slowly Michael's world begins to collapse. The family estate is taken over by Nazis and his father is accused of collaboration with them. As a small soldier in the war, Michael keeps the real truth hidden--that his father is working against the enemy--but pays for his love of the beautiful horse Midnight by losing all that he has loved.<br /><br />This is a beautifully written page turner of a novel with lovely illustrations by Seredy. Michael, Prince Chestry, and Nana are memorable long after the story is over, and once again Seredy glorifies the life of the \\"ordinary\\" farmer, who she considers to be the true royalty.	2005-05-12

If you can look past the \\"Mary Sue\\" convention that a newspaper editor like Mr. Gibson would even give a kid like Kit the time of day, this is a great story about Kit and Stirling investigating mysterious goings-on at the Cincinnati Zoo that threaten the employment of their friend Will, a hobo who knows he is not trusted by the local adults.<br /><br />Filled with great tidbits about the zoo's past and also how the Kittredges and their boarders have to live, this is quite an interesting read. There's even a few lessons herein, but the author doesn't beat you over the head with them.<br /><br />I hope the fact that the Pleasant Company people are now publishing mysteries featuring the American Girls doesn't mean they will abandon their History Mystery series where other girls from other eras get involved in mysteries.

As always, she spends most of her time with her friend Anna, who lives on the next farm. But WWII has brought a change to the community: Anna's parents, who are German, are suspected of being loyal to the Fatherland. Rumors abound and also affect Anna's older brother Max, who works at a nearby airfield. Then Molly's aunt Eleanor is involved when propaganda flyers are found hidden in her airplane when she makes a stop at the airfield while shuttling it to Texas. Could Max be the culprit? Or is it someone else at the airfield? Molly is determined to find out.<br /><br />This is a good historical mystery for younger girls, who will learn some history painlessly--in fact, adults will learn things as well; I had never heard about the pro-Nazi group the Silver Shirts mentioned in the book. I also enjoyed the way everything wasn't wrapped up at the end of the story; pretty much like real life.	2005-03-21

I am a history buff and bought this book about 25 years ago at the urging of a friend's grandfather, who had grown up during the era and found it to be very true to life. I'm very happy to see it in print again. Another friend told me she found this book very negative. I think Bettman wrote it for that purpose, because too many people on nostalgia kicks think \\"the good old days\\" with family values and lots of farms and homes like in MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS were perfect and beautiful. Yes, all those things existed, but the entire country was not like that and Bettman wants you to see the bad that existed alongside the good. For every happy little Sally Benson family living in a pretty house in St. Louis, there was a slum family living in two rooms and barely eating. For every beautiful farm there was a dirty, nasty one. For every beautiful landscape like Yosemite there were sooty, stinking places like Pittsburgh with air thick with coal dust and sludge draining into the rivers. As for the book being anti-American--huh? Certainly Bettman compares us to better things in Europe; we were still a frontier country at the time, for all the sophistication of \\"the East\\" and we had not yet adapted the better things in Europe to our use here. Certainly Europe was no bed of roses, as other historians and even fiction writers like Anne Perry have pointed out!<br /><br />As for the complaint about \\"too many drawings\\"--huh???? Yes, they had photography in those days, but the process to transfer them to newspaper and magazines was expensive and not used regularly until after the turn of the century. Those \\"drawings\\" are engravings and woodcuts used to illustrate newspapers and magazines at the time. Photos were not used. Bettman is showing us how our ancestors illustrated the problems he talks about in the periodicals of the times.	2005-03-13

It takes me back to 1966 when I was in fifth grade at Stadium School. We had a student teacher named Miss Greenberg who announced to us that she was going to begin reading aloud to us every day after lunch. We were ten and eleven year olds and highly insulted that the teacher wanted to read to us like babies! Then Miss Greenberg started reading JOHNNY TREMAIN. Within a week none of the kids in class could wait to get back from lunch, even the boys who professed that they \\"hated books.\\" There were two copies of JOHNNY TREMAIN in the school library and after that first week they were reserved for weeks in advance. I begged my mother for a copy for Christmas; she had to go crazy to order one because they were out of print back then. She finally found a teacher's edition that had study questions at the end of the book. I loved the portrait of Boston in the 1770s and although Johnny was a little too arrogant for my taste in the beginning, I grew to like him as he changed in the course of the book. My favorite character has always been Cilla Lapham, but I love Johnny's horse Goblin as well, and Rab and the Lornes and Miss Bessie, the Lytes' cook. They are all welcome friends.	2005-03-04

The prose is absolutely beautiful, describing things in imaginative language, and the detailed pen-and-ink drawings are a wonder to behold. The story speaks of the nature of evil--real evil and not the piecrust bad guys of some juvenile fiction--and good with a collection of wondrous characters. The animals in particular are memorable, including Tundra the wolf and Lexy the mischievous fox.<br /><br />There are some very dark places in the narrative, so I would not recommend the book to a very young child who is overly sensitive, but otherwise imaginative readers will love this book.	2005-01-20

Tedrow's &quot;Laura Ingalls Wilder&quot; series should be burned. I mean, if it was possible to give books a minus score, this series would be a minus 5 (or even better, a minus 100). Tedrow's version of Laura's adult story tosses in events that never happened, including the birth of another child to the Wilders, an Almanzo who sounds like a hayseed and calls Laura &quot;Laurey&quot; instead of his real nickname for her, &quot;Bess,&quot; and a Laura who does things the real Laura Ingalls Wilder would be horrified by, including shoving an obnoxious woman into a big punchbowl.<br />Worse, Tedrow uses this supposed story of Laura Ingalls Wilder to introduce his own characters, the three Youngun children, Terry, Larry, and Sherry, who are the offspring of the widowed minister. Half of each of &quot;Laura's&quot; book is actually about these kids, who were later spun off into their own series of books. Apparently Mr. Tedrow envisioned Laura as a TV series to be used as a spin-off vehicle. He couldn't possibly have been interested in writing a decent series about her life, or we wouldn't have ended up with this hideous series of books.	2004-05-28

Hamner and Sipes have crossed the storyline in two different LASSIE television series. The setting and situation are the little town in Vermont from the 1997 Animal Planet LASSIE series, where the mom is a widowed veterinarian. But instead of mother and son being Karen and Timmy Cabot, they are Ruth and Timmy Martin from the 1960s LASSIE original series episodes, and the illustrations are clearly that of June Lockhart and Jon Provost!<br />However, the young children-and most Lassie fans--for which this was written probably won't care. It's an exciting story about a dangerous situation on Christmas Eve, the illustrations are gorgeous, and the story actually touches on the true meaning of Christmas rather than receiving expensive gifts and Santa Claus and his reindeer. Very enjoyable for any Lassie fan.	2004-05-28

Then this is the book for you. K. O'Connor (K. for Kathleen? Katherine? Kerry? The only mystery left unsolved is her first name), smart young journalist with a talent for interviewing celebrities, has a plum assignment dropped in her lap: an in-depth interview of Vince Collins, still popular older pop singer and movie actor. Vince and his onetime partner, comedian Lanny Morris, have a particular skeleton in their closet--or perhaps I should say their hotel bathroom, a place where, years earlier, a young woman's corpse was discovered. Needless to say, the guys had flawless alibis, but the incident appeared to have led to the breakup of their partnership. Now Vince's interview contract gives O'Connor much latitude, and she's determined to ask him The Question about The Body. But no sooner has O'Connor found out Lanny Morris is planning to write his own book about the incident than she accidentally meets him on a flight to New York...and then things really start to get complicated.<br />Rupert Holmes' penchant for clever wordplay and descriptions, so evident in his playwright work, music, and in the series REMEMBER WENN, is in full throttle here. Along with fascinating descriptions of things like the Warner Brothers studio tour, the hidden restaurant at Disneyland, and backstage at a Mets game and at a telethon--not to mention the pitfalls that go with the perks of being a celebrity, O'Connor's deductions, fears, discoveries, and delights-oh, and betrayals--unfold in a lively narrative that contains more twists than an old-fashioned cruller. One of the best chapters is her memorable interview with the deceased woman's mother, which is quite chilling. One advisory: even if you're reading this book on a full stomach, there are so many great restaurants described it will have you longing for a good dinner somewhere! Highly recommended.	2003-08-08

It's not high art, but no one expects it to be--do they? I'm reading the notes about &quot;errors&quot; with some amusement. The quotes from Saint-Exup&eacute;ry and the references to King Tut can be taken as sloppy research--however, since in our world Elemental Masters do not exist, this must be an alternate universe, and who's to say that in this alternate universe that this historical event and that author didn't happen/exist earlier? (Jack Finney uses the Dakota Apartment building in his fantasy novel TIME AND AGAIN, which takes place in 1882 and it wasn't built until 1886, something he admits. It just works.) No one is writing a straight history story here! As for Misty's Lord Peter character, he is not Lord Peter Wimsey, so why all the fuss about him not being the correct age? He is indeed a homage to Peter Wimsey, but he is not the same character (for one thing he mentions he has three siblings, not two)!	2003-04-08
