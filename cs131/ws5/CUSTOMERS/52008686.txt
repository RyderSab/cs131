Andy was a fat kid who was an easy target for bullies like Eddie and Billy. He was loved by the adults because he was smart and groomed. But his home life was hell. His father Hal abused both him and his mother. His grandmother was unhappy and abusive to him and her son (Andy's father). The person who helps him explore his love of literature is his Uncle Charles. He has a collection of books that Andy escapes into.  <br />When he turns twelve, he starts running. Not only has it kept his weight down, but it is what he does to avoid what is happening around him. He has a friend in Evan, whose younger brother Eddie torments him. His feelings for Evan are strong. Evan however, is forced to leave the community for being gay.  <br />My Father's Scar explores homosexuality among teenagers and how they cope with their orientation. Andy knew that if he stayed any longer in his hometown, he would be an outcast. College is a haven where Andy feels he can be someone. But he searches endlessly for a loving relationship that he lacked in his family. The people that affect him help shape him to be the person that he is. I highly recommend this book for high school and college students.	2005-09-17

Arriving there she sees a mysterious man who tosses a wreath of flowers and a charm into the ground where the coffin lays. Pilar wonders who the man is.  <br />Coming home to the neighborhood where her grandmother lived and died is reminiscent of the days where things were slow-paced and simple. Time never let the city fade. The flora of the city Los Rosales has never been touched by ecological disasters. It remains filled with eucalyptus, orange blossoms, birds of paradise, and wine-red bougainvillea. The scents draw her into a time period. <br />Going between the past and the present, Marisol reflects on a time period where women were expected to be married and have children. They were to remain virtuous for marriage. Pilar is given a set of diaries that Gabriela Grenales de Knowles has left. As she reads them on her trip back to Chicago, she discovers who the real Gabriela is.  <br />Gabriela was groomed to be a lady by her mother and a servant of native Indian/Spanish descent as a child. It would carry with her throughout her adult life. She had to learn to entertain her audience, prepare meals, and sexually gratify her partner. Upkeeping tradition was important to her but at what cost? The cost of a real love. She was in love with Jorge Armando. But she couldn't marry him because his family was mixed. As much money as Jorge's family had, her family forbid it. They were full-blooded European tracing their ancestry to the Spanish.  <br />Gabriela married an Englishman and had a daughter with him. But it wasn't enough for her. Her true love was Jorge and rebelling against tradition would have cost her her reputation and her family. The diaries are a layout for her granddaughter to follwo but to do it on her own terms.  <br />The Lady, the Chef, and the Courtesan, based on a South American proverb was good to read because it does layout some grooming techniques, reminiscent of what it is to be feminine. However I was disturbed by the racial makeupShe focused too much on the indigenous Indians, mixed Indian/Spanish and Spanish. She did not mention that there are people of African descent living in Venezuela nor did she present any of their traditions that could have helped the novel a bit.  <br />It is a good book to read when you are going to work and coming home from work on the train.	2005-08-14

It is about a boy, Peter, who is disgruntled at the change that is occuring around the house for his new baby sister Susie. Peter sees that his baby items are being painted over in pink, which is the color that will identify if the baby is going to be a girl. Babies don't care what color their furniture is.  <br />But Peter feeling that everything he has is going to be given to his sister, takes his childhood chair and runs away from home. But he realizes that he isn't a little boy anymore. He is a boy but not a baby. He has to accept change in the household when a sibling is born. Peter is not seen as a spoiled brat. He just doesn't want to have to give in to Susie. Peter learns a valuable lesson and is willing to help his family any way he can.  <br />Ezra Jack Keats, rest in peace, is a good storyteller. His stories are centered around the urban areas. He doesn't paint a negative view of the city. He rather illustrates it as a community of supporting and close-knit citizens. His books dispel the media misconception of the dying city.	2005-07-29

The book starts out with a letter written to Jane McGregor, the narrator, that her job at Maximum Office Supplies has been eliminated. To make matters worse, her paramour Mike signed her pink slip. On top of it, it's her third time being laid off.    Jane lives in a two-bedroom apartment that she can't afford. Since her roommate left to live with her fiance, she has been struggling to pay her rent on time to a landlord whose English isn't so good and uses the money to gamble at the race track. He threatens to put her out if she doesn't come up with the rent, which is exorbitant. Being attached to her apartment, she brings in a reckless and vengeful fellow employee to help her with the cost of rent which turns into one hell of a misadventure for Jane.    She finds out that her father has been laid off from his job in the corporate world and her mother has been hired at a trendy web company. Jane's father, who struggles to maintain his staunch conservative appearance, cracks when his wife has left him. Jane gets caught up in a scheme tconcocted by her new roommate that to get back at the company for massive layoffs. But she finds that there isn't any such thing as \\"all for one, and one for all\\". Her ex Ron further gets her in trouble with the law. How much of a mess has she allowed herself to get into?    Luckily, there is Kyle, her brother's childhood friend. He let her know that what she did was a felony and not a 'misdomeanor'. Kyle is a man that she should set herself up with. Ron and Mike were jerks and losers. They had it written on their faces. Ron may have been a friendly person, but he lacked common sense. He spent his time smoking dope and dealing drugs. Mike is a good-for-nothing cheat. He had no intention of being real with Jane. He uses sex to masculate himself.     Unfortuantely, Jane possessed that \\"I don't care\\" attitude which got her into the messthat she shouldn't have been in. She needed to strictly set boundaries on Missy and Ron because they were her near downfall.    Don't take this book too seriously. Frankly, I wouldn't have gotten too far if I were to be laid off!	2005-07-17

This movie confirmed that the main character, a black model, was caught up by the lure of her \\"beauty\\". She was scantily clad and wearing a wig. The backdrop was a slave fortress. Neither she nor the photographer took any interest as to what the castle represented until she had an out of body experience that forced her to confront the atrocities of the slave trade.   Transported back to time, she is Shona, a houseslave on a plantation who is abused physically and sexually. She at first, is fearful to fight because it will cost her her life. But sometimes it is better to risk your life than to be cruelly treated in the hands of the oppressors.   The horrors of slavery have distorted us not only physically, but mentally. It brought deep self-resentment and discord among Africans. It brought bodily myths that remain til this day.  I got the chance to meet Haile Gerima and he is a very good historian and lecturer. The ignorance, according to him, lies in us because we are afraid of our own history, so we consume mainstream culture that is borrowed and deconstructed. Gerima's film is an example of how we must find ourselves as Africans in America and around the world.	2005-07-09

After reading ten chapters of the book, it's pretty obvious that the relationship between Maurice and Omenita wasn't going anywhere nor was it going to be happily ever after.   <br />It is pathetic that, as African-Americans, we still hold each other back because of fear and selfishness.  Omenita possessed a great deal of selfishness, unhappines and ignorance.  She worried about what others were thinking, failed to make better for herself, and expected Maurice to carry the weight she was carrying from her dysfunctional family.   <br />Maurice has two loving parents who worked hard to secure his future and well-being.  Audrey, Maurice's mother, had every right to resent her because she didn't know how to carry herself as a lady and an adult.  Maurice saw that Omenita was all about herself but he rebelled against his mother to prove to her that by being a man, he would marry her. <br />Marriage and sex do not make a man.  It is character and worth and Maurice has good character and worth that would make any woman want to be his wife.  Omenita needed a reality check and Maurice was not her ticket to gaining her self-worth.   <br />Growing up does hurt but making foolish decisions hurts even more.	2005-06-26

Growing up under a manipulative, strong-willed mother, she never had much of a chance to be fully a woman.  She was still a child because she depended on her mother fearing that she would lose her love if she became fully independent.  Dare wanted to reconstruct a family that was already damaged.  The bears were her father and brother and Edie, her mother was out of the picture.  Her family was never complete.  Ivan, her father died before she had the chance to see him.  She did connect with her brother Blaine through a maternal uncle.  But his bitterness towards his mother remained.  Edie was unapologetic and fought constantly with him.   <br />Edie never remarried because she didn't want to get burned.  Blaine and Dare never married.  Blaine never got over his abandonment and feared that he would not be able to provide.  And Dare, despite her beauty and the number of available suitors, remained her mother's precious child.   <br />After the death of her mother and brother, her mental state deteriorated.  She needed extensive therapy because she never got over her fears of separation, dependency and abandonment. <br />I came across Edith and the Bears when I was in kindergarten and have lost the images of the blond doll and her furry friends.  Having read The Bombshell Manual of Style, Dare Wright's title book Edith and the Bears brought back some of those memories of childhood.  It reinforced me as a young woman, what it is like to play with dolls and bears and dress up.  The Edith books bring back that nostalgia of what it is to be a girl.  We didn't know that the author's life was intertwined with the book nor did we know that she was lonely, despite the fan base she had ( and still does).   <br />Jean Nathan does a good job bringing forth the author's achievements as well as her personal life.  I hope that she, Brooke Ashley, and loyal fans of the Edith books can bring back some of Wright's books from obscurity.	2005-06-19

Pedro Infante, a popular Mexican actor during the forties and the fifties, is a hearthrob for Teresina Avila, her best friend Irma, and her fan club members.  He is a symbol of machismo.  His passion is women and women are drawn to his charms and looks.  His death has made him legendary.   <br />Teresina, or Tere, is a teacher's aide involved with a self-centered married man Lucio Valadez.  Lucio promises her the sun and the moon which are never delivered to her.  He cheats on her as well as his wife.  Irma and Ubaldo, another friend of hers, tell her that she needs to do away with him.  But she clings on to hope that she will have him and they'll be a family along with Lucio's daughter Andrea.  Unfortunately, a series of events will force Tere to confront the reality of her life and self.   <br />Chavez is not afraid to express the lives of Mexican women and their descendants or does she sugarcoat on homosexuality and sexual child abuse of Ubaldo Miranda.  The description of a town gives the reader an idea of what it is like to be a part of a small community that clings to its old customs despite the occuring changes. <br />This is a good read which took me a week to read.  Highly recommended.	2005-06-06

To Susan Fales-Hill, she was a superstar,devoted mother and wife. Her parents were set up by a friend of her father's. Josephine, at first, refused him. Time permits and she accepts his offer of a date. The two eventually fall in love and their marriage plans wmake the front cover of  The Chicago Defender, an African-American news publication. On the other side, the Yankee gentry hearing of this is shocked and dismayed by her father's choice of bride. His name is taken off the social register.   To some people, it would be a fairy tale. But this is Fales-Hill's world. They lived in thier own world where everyone was welcome. They entertained the likes of Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll, and Eartha Kitt. Beneath the marriage, Ms. Hill's father had a wandering eye and her mother, despite her good looks and style, struggled to get the recognition she wanted in the entertainment industry. Premice was told she was too dark or not black enough. Hill defines her as a strong-willed woman who continued to live for the sake of her children.   What I like about this story is that it gives black women a sense of pride in themselves.  Josephine and her friends took pride in their appearances even when things weren't in proper alignment.  They managed to make it through good and bad times.      This is a time-honored book that will relate to black mothers and their daughters. Josephine Premice deserves her place in the entertaiment industry.	2005-05-23

Finding this book at a book sale, 24 Reasons explains why African-Americans suffer in their own country.  The author points out that the fault pretty much lies within us.  Despite our brutal and glorious history in America, we have yet to unify because we are locked mentally and physically and unless we make some changes, we will continue this cycle which has affected our families, our communities, ourselves.  However, the subject of homosexuality and interracial relationships sparked me.  If the brother or sister is gay, let him/her be gay.  I would rather they not be in the closet.  Self-expression is important and that is one of many reasons why we remain in the box.  As for interracial relationships, I feel that if the person is going to be involved with someone of a different background, he/she should know about himself before before getting involved with that person outside of his race.  However, not all interracial relationships aren't about love.  They are more about gaining status, self-loathing, and media misconceptions about one another.  But this book does give in-depth as to how we need to rebuild our families, our communities, and ourselves.	2005-05-02

Despite what happened in the author's life, she has the creativity to put this book together so little girls and the little girl in me can enjoy looking at the pictures without feeling disturbed.  I am not very disturbed by these images.  People have a tendency to overanalyze and become paranoid afterwards.

The book I am assigned to read in English class and write a paper on modernism.  Mrs. Dalloway is at first a slow read but each day of reading the book helps the reader to know what events and thoughts are taking place among each character.  England was breaking slowing from Victorian morals creating a society that would not be based on a person's rank in class and gender.  It also is recouperating from World War One.  The climate was changing and not everyone could keep up the pace.  Septimus suffered a nervous breakdown after witnessing the death of his friend Evans.  Miss Kilman, a German patriot and born-again Christian, disdainfully looked down on Clarissa for putting on a show.  And Elizabeth, Mrs. Dalloway's daughter, was her own person rather than a copy of her mother.  Just to name a few supporting characters that intricately make the book a good read.   <br />I did find the book tedious to read but it was a very interesting and insightful story of how the upper class lead daily lives giving them human characteristics rather than a shallow appearance of diamonds and pearls.	2004-11-04

I read it in the third grade and loved it.  Some things never change as to how we view others making judgements of what we see on the outside.  Elsie Edwards was the new student in class.  Her weight made the students uncomfortable and disgusted, including Jenny.  Jenny was picked to make Elsie feel welcome which she found unfair.  An attack of the flu and seeing Elsie in tears made her realize that Elsie wasn't a bad person after all.    Elsie's weight problem was a result of her parents marital discord.  Food was given to her for comfort.  Her mother, seeing how it affected her put on a stric diet.  But Elsie's mother having no patience with Elsie, decides she is better off in a boardng school.  Elsie's mother was not attached emotionally to Elsie.  She saw her as something standing in her way.  Jenny's friendship with Elsie changed not only Jenny, but her two friends Diane and Sharon.  Elsie's self-esteem also improved.    The book is a good read.  As people, we make hasty judgements towards others not by listening to others and worrying what others are thinking.  Rather than going by instinct, we tend to hold back and limit ourselves.  Nothing's Fair shows us that friendships don't matter in size and form.	2004-10-06

Newcomer to Pittsburgh Emmett Honeycutt brings a great amount of color in the novel with his Southern charm.  He is a great friend to Michael when Brian isn't around.  Lindsay appears in the novel as a straight lady who can get any man's attention.    Quinn Brockton sheds some light on the characters of the cable series bringing forth their personalities and differences and how they come together.    I can't wait for the next book.	2004-05-23

Ms. Bosnak chronicles how her excessive spending put her serious debt using her credit card statements, listing what she bought, and assuming whether it was a need or a want.  Like her, my debt (not as much as hers) put me in an emotional and physical state.  I gained weight, wore what could fit me because I couldn't afford to get a new wardrobe, and cried because I didn't know how I was going to meet the payments.  The stores that she frequented were more expensive.  I had to settle for Hecht's and mail-order catalogs like Tweeds and Chadwick's.  I got rid of the credit cards with the help of my mother.  She wasn't too happy when I showed her the statements.  But she did show me where I was messing up in using credit cards.  <BR>Ms. Bosnak, like myself and others, try to keep up with the Joneses in the latest fashions and accessories.  It's more than one can take and it can be very costly.  I did find her creative designing a website to get herself out of debt and to show others what not to do in her situation.  This book was a very good read and I would highly require it for college students to read before they graduate from college.  Moral of the story--living beyond your means can hurt more than improve your lifestyle.	2004-02-18

It's so good to read because Rebecca doesn't seem to understand that she is putting herself in debt because of her excessive spending.  But yet, it's so funny because she can't seems to figure out why she is in the mess she is in.  She is no financial whiz but yet writes for a financial magazine.  This book in one way, is helpful for any woman who finds herself in debt or is close to it.  It shows the reader what not to do and what you need to do.  Kinsella does a great job at pointing out the effects of consumerism and what it does to the individual in society without boring the reader.	2004-01-11

Scott Barron, a writer, recently released his new book of poems &quot;Men and Other Mammals&quot;.  Despite the success of his book, his personal life is another story.  He has unresolved issues with his father, figuring out as to why he left him and his brother as children and his girlfriend of eight months has left him.  Scott begins to wonder what is his lot in life besides writing.  Does he feel he needs a relationship to make his life complete?  Does he feel helping others will make him better?  <BR>The book was a great read, rather than a good read.  It was funny when he and his father kidnap a penguin and keep him in his flat reeking and soiling his bathroom.  It was gross when he threw up in front of his audience as he reads a piece from his book.  But it was overall interesting as to know what defines manhood.  Jim Keeble did a good job.  Hope he comes out with another interesting book to keep the reader in tune.	2003-10-25

Instead he lives with his oldest brother Joe, who treats him like a servant and harshly disciplines him.  Puppatee, no longer able to live with his brother, moves in with his sister.  However, he is lured into crime at a young age and goes in and out of the legal system.  He tries to go straight but finds it hard to because of a lack of education and experience.  He continues to rob and steal to support his women, children and himself.  <BR>Puppatee's parents sent him to England to be given a proper education but he faced the harsh cruelties of England and his brother without having contact with his family back home.  He doesn't contact his family until he almost a grown man when he returns to Jamaica to visit his family after an older brother dies.  Perhaps if Puppatee were to have decided to settle in Jamaica, he could have taken over the family farm and lived a completely different life.  Better yet, if he were to live in England with the brother, Joe would have been treated him like family, showing him the value of hardwork and handing out discipline less harshly.  Puppatee could have avoided a life of crime, obtain an education, and get a legitimate job.  <BR>Rocky Carr does a good job at emphasizing the crimes he committed, the underworld of London, and the culture of Afro-Caribbeans.	2003-09-01

The three are both skeptical of the idea of investing.  At each year, all three are to decide whether to sell or keep the stock and learn about the stock market and money management.

I read this book after finishing some of the other books I have listed for this year and found that this book is a delightful and entertaining read.  Cat MacAllister, who lives for glamour, fame, and eternal youth, finds that her trust fund is dwindling and is forced to reassess herself by entering the workforce.  Cat, who has achieved some fame from cancelled shows and modelling in Japan, wants more exposure as her celebrity counterparts.  Being late for her fourth twenty-ninth birthday, she missed the top celebrities and spent her evening with the lesser knowns.    She does whatever she can to get into the limelight by attending a fundraiser and adopting a Chinese baby girl, meeting with a \\"prince\\" from a \\"kingdom\\" and setting up a website with her confident transsexual India.  Standing in her way is a supermodel named Teeny and possibly the threat of poverty.

I figure if I can watch a show that has gay themes, why not watch this show? <BR>Speaking of the show, the book is a pretty good read as to how the friendship between Brian and Michael continues to remain despite their differences.  The reader also understands as to why Brian is the way he is--unaffectionate, determined, and brash.  Michael lives in a childlike existense with his comic books and collectibles.  He doesn't open up about his sexuality until prom night when he is forced to confront a classmate and himself.  Both Brian and Michael, despite their different paths remain close friends.  The book focuses mainly on the friendship of Brian and Michael.  The boy Justin was just a hint of what is expected if they were to meet again.	2003-04-24

My sister bought it and read it in a day and said the book was good.  I read it after her and she was right about that.  The author with her social knowledge of the French, made it entertaining and worthwhile to read.  Imagine yourself in Paris at a cafe by yourself elegantly dressed and calm and by chance a man seeks your affections.  This book was a breath of fresh air as to how French women celebrate their feminity and embrace life.  They don't let the little stuff worry them like some of us do.

As Judge Judy points out to her audience, there are no courts that protect couples living together.  People who decide to live together, need to set up a legal contract.  When things fall apart, the last thing needed is the distress and lawsuits that don't have any validity of who or what is owed.  In a society that pushes marriage on men and women, it's refreshing to know that there are people who choose to be happy with an alternative lifestyle.  When the marriage falters, couples have to seek legal assistance to end their marriage.  And divorce drags on for years because the courts fuel the fire which drains both parties emotionally and financially.  And children are caught in this mudslinging.  Perhaps an alternative to marriage may change the divorce laws in this country.	2003-03-30

But their dieting also made the younger sister want to go on a diet which led to anorexia nervosa and her untimely death.  What the mother failed to understand was that her weight loss wasn't any guarantee that she would be happier with herself or that her daugther would be happy.  Instead, it created more misery and unhappiness for the whole family.  The father rarely had a say in the household.  Basically, the viewer knew what type of a household it was.  <BR>Lifetime made it worth watching.

She lists the top ten thinks that aren't okay and in the back of the book, the reader makes her own list of ten things that aren't okay.<br />The Table of Contents<BR>Chapter One:  Having Babies Out of Wedlock--The context &quot;it's my body&quot; is taken way out of proportion.  When that child is born, the umbilical cord is severed and a whole new life is present.  How do you tell the child where his father is?  Does that child have a right to a family intact?  Think about that.<br />Chapter Two:  Expecting Someone Else to Raise Your Child--Leaving your child in the care of others is careless and irresponsible.  It is the responsibility of the parent to raise that that child when it comes into this world.  Parenting is a daunting endless task!<br />Chapter Three:  Making Your Older Child Responsible for Your Younger Child--It's one thing to help with the younger siblings; it's another to have him/her raise them.  It is the responsibility of mom and dad to be responsible for their children.<br />Chapter Four:  Talking Negatively To Your Child About His (or her) Absent Father--This is the absolute worst thing to do!  Talking negatively about your child's father does more harm than good to your child.  And you, mom are made out to be the maligner; not dad.<br />Chapter Five:  Supporting Your Child in a Wrong--All parents think the best of their children, but it's not okay to support a child's wrong.  You are teaching him/her that it's okay to get away with anything and engaging in this behavior.<br />Chapter Six:  Keeping and Supporting a Man--The price is too high to keep him around.  Men like that don't respect you and it's a sets a bad example for the children (if you have any).  <br />Chapter Seven:  Letting a Man Spend the Night in Your Home in Your Bed (with your child's awareness)--Your child doesn't respect you when allow a stranger into the house that isn't in any relation to him.  This impact affects him/her for life.  <br />Chapter Eight:  Keeping Adult Children in Your Home and Supporting Them--Sometimes it's hard letting go of your children, but some remain at home for circumstances that unfold into excuses.  This upsets parents when adult children stay in the nest and sponge off of them.<br />Chapter Nine:  Raising Grandchildren While Your Own Adult Children Party (live irresponsibly)--In no way should a parent have to be burdened with the responsibility of rearing their granchildren, unless the parent is neglectful, dead, or abusive.  It's the adult child's responsibility to raise the child.<br />Chapter Ten:  Make Welfare a Way of Living--One should be dependable on themselves.  Welfare should be only used as a last resort.  It's important for each of us to teach our generation to be responsible adults and not rely on the government to bail us out when things go down.<br />These chapters described do not inspire confidence.  Rather, they demean us and it's up to us exercise control by correcting what's not okay so our children and next of kin won't have to make the same mistakes.

Our eductaion system tells us how to work hard for money; it doesn't teach us how to make money work for us. So many of us, even when we become older are grappling with debt and Congress recently passed a bill that that doesn't help make the financial situation any better.   This is a good reference book for both young and mature adults. It helps the young how to manage money and it is also helpful for parents as a guide to teach underage children.   We need to be aware of credit card companies that market to the young preying on their financial illiteracy. It is up to us, parents and teachers to take action and let them know about money management before they come out of college with additional debt they don't need.	2002-08-10

She based it on a group of women that she meets regularly.  Each woman, different in age, profession, and character, met after the class ended to form their own group and share what they wrote and also cope with the problems that one person brought to the table.<BR>It's refreshing to read books about a group of women, despite what their lives are, help one another get through the obstacles that put them down.  I chose this book because I belong to a similar group like theirs and in my group, we get together to write and share our stories.

She does a great job on tackling race, sex, class, and history.  Her geographical research from Jamaica to Turkey to Bangladesh is an excellent guide for the reader as she is describing her characters and their reason for being in the story.  <BR>The book based in North London encounters two unlikely, yet interesting men Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal.  The reason I say interesting because as you read in to the story you wonder why they are the way they are.  Both men \\"served\\" in World War 2.  The word served is quoted because they really didn't do any combat in their battalion.  They rather served their commander and battalion.  Even after the war, they still serve; but to their employers.  Archie works for a printing company performing miniscule tasks and Samad is a waiter in an Indian restaurant.<BR>The book touches on some issue of multiculturalism and assimilation.  Samad, fearing that his sons will be too influenced by the mainstream culture of rap and rock music and name brand clothes, sends one son to live with his family in Bangladesh leaving one son behind.  He couldn't afford to send the both to live with his family.  He wants his sons to know the meaning of Islam and what it is to be a colored.  But he himself doesn't really have any idea of who he really is.  He drinks Guiness and is in the past about a sepoy who resisted the British.  He is even more disappointed when his sons have failed to live up to his expectations.<BR>Irie Jones, the daughter of Clara Bowden, a Jamaican, and Archie Jones, is dealing with her own awkwardness.  She is attracted to the wreckless Millat who only sees her as a friend.  She works for the Chalfens who are influential to her which upsets her mother.  She looks at her family and at Samad's family and comes to the conclusion that they are all outrageous.<BR>The book for me was too hard to put down.  I had to know what would happen next in chapters as I was reading.  I find that reading takes a great deal of patience and reading \\"White Teeth\\" one has to understand what the writer is talking about.	2002-06-21

She also develops the story as to what is going to happen next.  It is why this book is a page turner that can't be put down.	2002-06-21

No matter what a brother or sister does to uplift the race, we are still viewed as Uncle Toms.  It's not enough that a brother or sister wants to embelish in his or her success without being made to feel that we are trying to be white.  Who we select as mates isn't really anyone's business.  Just because they chose outside doesn't necessarily mean that they don't have a great impact on the black community.  As a member of the African-American community, we should be encouraging one another to achieve and strive to be what we can be.  Not stabbing one another in the back and bringing another down.  This book is nothing more than a backlash to successful people of color.	2002-06-11

This novel can't compete with Sandra Kitt's books on interracial relationships between black women and white men.  The cover of the book made it seem like it was going to be a good read.  The models were in a sultry and seductive pose.  However, after a week of reading the book, I came to the conclusion that the story dragged on.  Ms. Cole was trying too hard to get her audience to understand what interracial relationships are on a black female/white male perspective.  She tended to focus too much on Denise Adams and her family rather than the situation between Denise and Ian.  After reading 200 pages of the book, I felt that the development of the relationship was going to be going nowhere.  It wasn't a good idea of the author to substitute a name for Howard University.  If she didn't want to use the name of the college, she could've just used historically black college in DC.  <BR>Recommended reading on this particular subject:  &quot;Fate&quot; by Pamela Leigh Starr and &quot;Color of Love&quot; by Sandra Kitt.  These novels have more development in their characters and plots.	2002-06-11

Do you ask yourself why you are in this position?  When you are in a conversation with others and they ask &quot;how's work?&quot;, how do you respond?  It took being fired to realize where I was heading.  I looked at my resume and under work experience were just places I temped at because they matched the skills that I trained for until I get that permanent job (which I eventually did).  It was then I decided that it was time for me to go back to school and obtain a career which is where I am at right now.  Rather than giving a bland response to a job that was just a job, I can share with people what I like about going back to school and what I am doing to secure a career.  And whenever someone feels the need to tell me what I am doing is not traditional, I respond back telling them that I am looking for a career, not a job!  Ms. Sinetar should be applauded, not disregarded for writing this book.	2002-01-25

Now in my late twenties, I read this book when I was entering fourth grade and I liked very much reading it.  Although my parents are still together, there are children, even as adults, dealing with divorce.  Karen Newman, the main character of the book, is coping with the unexpected events that are going on during her parents separation.  She meets another girl that lives in the same building as her father whose parents are divorced.  However, her reaction to her parents' breakup is much different from Karen's.  She already knew from an early age that her father's role in her life was a small part.  She accepts her mother being a single parent and going back out into the dating scene.  Karen eventually gets through and comes to the conclusion that her parents aren't getting back.  This is an interesting read not only for children, but for adults as well.	2002-01-11

This book gives a complexity of how each family member is taken by the news of Guy's announcement to leave his wife of forty years for a much younger ambitious woman.  Guy, the family patriarch, has been having an affair for seven years with fellow legal eagle Merrion Palmer.  The novel goes back and forth into time detailing Guy and Laura's marriage and his encounter with the mistress.  In addition to Guy, Laura, and Merrion, the Stockdale children Simon and Alan wrestle with their father's departure from the marriage.    Reading this book, one would feel sorry for Laura, the suffering wife.  But as the reader examines closely into her character, we see a woman who has made herself a shadow of her husband's and leans on to both of her sons which have an effect on their personal lives and significant others.    Merrion Palmer, the mistress, although independent, needs male coompanionship.  Guy makes up for what she didn't have--a male figure.  Her father died when she was three years old and her mother's second marriage to his best friend ended bitterly in divorce affecting Merrion's views of a family.    This book is not sexually candid, which is good.  The details of the affair are easily interpreted and what is shown is a pattern of how marital infidelity affects a family and a community.	2001-12-27

At first it was interesting because the character Nicoletta was a free spirit who vowed never to be married to anyone who would subject her to abuse or become servile to.  It was when she met Don Giovanni Scarletti, she sensed something evil about him and his family.  Don Scarletti had possession of her mind, body, and soul.  His dark features were erotic, yet frightening to Nicoletta.  However, I have found myself getting a little bored with the book.  It seems as if something that is bound to happen, doesn't happen.

Rebecca Bloomwood spent beyond her means and let it spin out of control because she failed to respond to her creditors and never asked herself if she really needed these things.

Eventually, the character triumphed with a job that she really loved and was able to keep in contact with her creditors.  This should be a valuable lesson for women who spend money they don't have and expect to be rescued from their situation.  This book was a great read and amusing.

I was take aback by the brash, handsome man with a sculpted torso and arms making love to this beautiful, milky fair-skinned woman with long, raven hair.  I had to read this book!  I loved it!  Her description of characters and the style of writing.  Now that I own the book, I can read it as many times as I want.  Ms. Smith's style of writing is erotic, intriguing, and romantic.	2000-10-06

To answer the reviewer's question, it's worth the purchase.  I read this book when I was a high school student working at a public library.  I came across it and read word for word what the author has written.  The spearhead of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, were instigators of the civil rights movement, slandering prominent and potent leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X and bringing down the Black Panther's Party.  <br />As I read this book at the bus station, a sister sitting next to me wanted to know what I was reading.  I showed her the book title and the author.  Her response was, &quot;You can't believe everything the white man says.&quot;  If she read this book, she would definitely believe what the author says!	2000-10-06

Written by Carl Hendricks, the man that Angela Seymour would meet and have a dangerous affair with.  Angela was sexually deprived in her marriage to a wealthy, ambitious black financier who's immersed into his work rather than her.  Carl fulfills her sexual desires but also attempts to destroy her.

I first read the raving reviews that were posted for this book and decided to buy it for myself.  As soon as I received the book from Amazon.com, I  immediately read it and found myself immersed into this interracial love  story.  Right next to Sandra Kitt, Pamela Leigh Starr is on my list for a  great interracial romance novel.  This book did good without the sex scenes  in some romance novels.  Hope to see another book written like this.	2000-09-20

Although the women in the book have a high status, that shouldn't restrict any woman from having a room of her own.  It doesn't take luxurious accomodations to create a room of her own.  With some imagination and  decorating sense, a woman should be able to create the atmosphere that she  wants.  I haven't purchased this book but have glanced through it at a  furniture store.  Yes, these women do have celebrity status, but they are  still women.  Self-fulfillment is to put yourself first and that is what  part of the book is based on.	2000-07-28

She summarized the book she had written.  Despite not having enough money to buy the book, I went ahead and bought it.  I have read it and find it very  intriguing, romantic, and heartwrenching.  I glance through this book to  understand the format written to improve on my writing.  Robyn Williams has  done a great job intertwining Phyllis Hyman and Imagany Jenkins.  Both  women have been through a great deal of trauma but Imagany proves to the  world that she is a survivor.  Keep on writing Ms. Williams!	2000-05-21

I had to wait for a couple of months to get this book.  As soon as I ordered it, I started reading.   It was too hard to put down.  What Dr. Cornish had to write about hit me.   The first chapter really hit me.  Friendship between women is very  valuable.  We must not break each other's trust for anyone.  I had a friend  and messed that relationship.  Although we associated very much, she never  really could trust me again. I didn't take her man.  We went to elementary  school together and she told me some stuff and I told it to others to get  their approval which didn't do any good because the people who really try  to be friends with, don't like you and will let you know it.  It's hurts to  think about what I did.  But it's too late to fix up the past.  In addition  to that, I was also bullied by a classmate who was detrimental to others.   Thank you Dr. Cornish for writing this book.	1999-11-26

The first time I saw this book I knew that it would be a great book and I was right!  This book explores interracial relationships from a black female/white male perspective.  Sandra Kitt should contact a director and  have this book made into a movie.	1999-10-13
