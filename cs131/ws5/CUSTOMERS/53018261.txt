The book is an easy read and doesn't overwhelm the parent with too many steps as self-help books often do.<br /><br />The clear, direct, and humorous writing style allows parents with hectic lives to quickly read the book, absorb its concepts, and put them to use. Each chapter ends with reflection questions to reinforce the themes from the chapter. The book continues its effectiveness whether or not the reader answers the questions. However, thinking about the questions might shed light on you, your kids, and your relationships.<br /><br />The concept of parents not letting their emotions guide their response to a child's troubles is not new, but Runkel shares stories, experiences, and explanations on how to do it. Sure, junior spilling juice all over the carpet can make any parent mad, but dealing with the situation while maintaining control has better results than a scream fest, spanking, or arguing.<br /><br />Though the book focuses on parenting, its concepts largely address ourselves as individuals. For we have to take care of us first before others. Instead of permissive or dictatorship parenting, Runkel encourages judo parenting, which is \\"the art of going with another's momentum.\\" He shows how to do this by providing the answers to the questions all parents get like \\"I'm bored,\\" \\"Are we there yet?\\" and \\"I hate you!\\"<br /><br />Two nitpicks. First, there are a few religious references. I wish this had been omitted because religion is a hot issue and the book's concepts fly well without the religious quotes or references. Using these unnecessarily limits the book's reach as people who skim the book might get the impression it's only for Christian parents. It's not.<br /><br />The second is not an issue, but rather a want for more examples of using the ScreamFree approach. The stories in the book explain the concept very well and having more would enhance the book's usefulness.<br /><br />When I told my oldest about the book, she said parents who yell are teaching their kids to yell when they become adults. Deep and accurate insight, as we've seen many children grow up to pick up their parents' bad habits. Overwhelmed parents can begin with one step by picking one situation that pushes their buttons and applying the ScreamFree approach until they get the hang of it. Runkel doesn't pressure the reader and the concepts are doable.xplain the concept very well and having more would enhance the book's usefulness.<br /><br />When I told my oldest about the book, she said parents who yell are teaching their kids to yell when they become adults.

The tips go beyond entering keywords into the search box or changing search engines. However, I found an error -- the book says to left-click on a selected word on any Web page and run a search on the selected word - It's right-click, not left.<br /><br />\\"Revisiting Web Pages\\" dives into bookmarks and how to get the most out of your bookmark file. The tricks explain how to quickly  find a Web page that is hidden in your bookmarks somewhere, and you don't have a clue what it is called and the keywords aren't giving you what you want. Also covered are RSS feeds, Live Bookmarks, and memory tools such as using history, managing cookies, using the password manager, and clearing tracks.<br /><br />Many people love Firefox because it's customizable. One way to make it your own is by changing the theme (look and feel). \\"Dressing up Firefox\\" explains how to find and change themes.<br /><br />Another way to get what you want out of Firefox is through extensions, covered in chapter 5's \\"Personalizing Firefox.\\" Yeow shows multiple ways of installing extensions and using the extension manager. The chapter works through the extensions the author recommends (he provides a good selection) and how they work.<br /><br />Intermediate Firefox users most likely want to jump ahead to chapter 6, \\"Tips, Tricks, and Hacks\\" and maybe chapter 7, which is for Web developers. Chapter 6 looks at about:config and how to modify preferences through its interface. Then Yeow shows where to find the user's profile, and covers what files are included in the profile and what they do.

After reading this book, I have decided to skip the review to enjoy the extra time. Oh? I have to write it? That's \\"wage slavery!\\" according to author Tom Hodgkinson who uses that term for \\"jobs.\\" He reveals his life changed for the better once he trashed his alarm clock. By the way, I'm not really a \\"wage slave,\\" as I don't get paid for these reviews -- just plain \\"slave.\\"<br /><br />The book covers a 24-hour period with each hour represented in an essay that starts with a quote and a sketch depicting the chapter's topic. The author opens with \\"Waking up Is Hard to Do\\" at 8 a.m. and immediately attacks the quote many of us relate to when it comes to waking up &mdash; Benjamin Franklin's \\"Early to bed...\\" philosophy. Hodgkinson recalls his mother screaming at him to wake up and now he starts his mornings as an idler by \\"sleeping in for a few more minutes.\\"<br /><br />In the first hour, he attacks Mr. Kellogg of Corn Flakes fame with humor, and explains that the assault against oversleeping started as far back as biblical times with a quote from Proverbs chapter six. Then Hodgkinson presents proponents of sloth like G.K. Chesterston who writes in his essay _On Lying in Bed_, \\"The tone now commonly taken towards the practice of lying in bed is hypocritical and unhealthy; instead of being regarded as it ought to be, as a matter of personal.\\"<br /><br />The hours that follow continue with the same approach while addressing different themes from 'sleeping in' to the hangover, to the art of the conversation and holidays. Every essay includes quotes and resources from the likes of Jerome K. Jerome, Winston Churchill, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and more to rally support for the idle life. Each hour stands on its own feet, so you can take your time and read them whenever.<br /><br />This author doesn't give advice on organizing your time so you can relax and take pleasure in life. Rather, think of it as the side of a debate that urges we sleep in, take naps, make time for tea, hang out at the pub, and live in our dream world. The author addresses the issues that affect the idler's life and tells the reader how to continue the merry idle way in spite of these barriers. Even some of the smartest minds in history did their best work in bed.<br /><br />Stories about inventor Thomas Edison, the enemy of idleness, say he slept only three or four hours a night because he liked to work at night and do his experiments during the day. It turns out, based on several witnesses; the inventor took naps in his lab.<br /><br />The book needs an index, but perhaps the author convinced his editors to take it easy, so they skipped it. With the many references to people and quotes, it would be nice to find something I read without working that hard to scan the pages.<br /><br />The book is a mixture of literary criticism, tongue-in-cheek wit, and insight into our society's neglect of the idle life. Readers desiring to become more familiar with the literary authors and other sages get a touch of these folks through their writings, comments, and actions on work and laziness. Hodgkinson writes a convincing manifesto for living easy and embellishes it with a diversity of classic resources.<br /><br />Take a moment to relish your life; work can wait.hang out at the pub, and live in our dream world.

US	53018261	R120FLF6KDPM3P	1590595009	990284833	1: The Best Software Writing I: Selected and Introduced by Joel Spolsky	Books	4	11	12	N	N	We need more writing on software-related topics like these	Having been in process management in a software organization for over ten years, I've seen too many articles and books on the topic that worked better than Valium for putting me to sleep especially since they have no side effects. Many say Joel Spolsky is one of the best writers on the topic of software. However, in this book he stands aside and lets others demonstrate that he isn't the only one who can write about software in English and captivate you.<br /><br />Joel on Software (his Web site slash blog) fans won't be disappointed in the selection of authors as they deal with the concepts he writes about on his site. Some readers may be expecting a book solely on software development. Even Spolsky's writings goes beyond this. Some folks might be disappointed that most of the articles, blog entries, speeches, and essays are available somewhere on the Web. I only recognize a few of the authors and their articles, so I would've never known about the others had I not found this book.<br /><br />The essays cover a gamut of development-related topics. They include coding style, outsourcing programmers, dealing with Excel as a database, using social software (Friendster, LinkedIn, Tribe, and all that) and the things that are right and wrong withthese shared spaces, emerging digital rights, and defining the two-phase commit process a la Starbucks. Even a couple of them are nothing but comics. The one on Windows search makes me laugh.<br /><br />The book also contains business-related essays that address a few problems affecting many companies -- namely team compensation and forced overtime which often spills over the weekend. Spolsky introduces every essay and includes notes clarifying abbreviations, names, or terms that aren't widely known. After all, the world of software is vast and it's impossible to know everything about it. I want to make sure it's clear -- Spolsky does NOT contribute an essay in this book.<br /><br />A manager can benefit from the book because of the insight into the developer's perspective which could help the manager become a better leader. The developer benefits because many of the issues covered can impact developers no matter what language is used for development. If you belong to neither management nor development, the best way to decide if the book is for you or not is to review the table of contents and reviews. If you find only one or two interesting possibilities, search for them online instead.<br /><br />I'm one of those who belong to neither group. My software organization background has been along the lines of an analyst and process manager. Even I find that most of the essays are enjoyable or educational. Only one or two lost me.<br /><br />While most of the content is available on the Internet for free, the book is worth the bucks. It's nice having a collection of high-quality writing related to software and the business in one place instead of surfing the Web for it. Furthermore, you get an opportunity to read about business offline -- I read most of the book while traveling on an airplane. Thanks to the book, the flight felt shorter. I appreciated and absorbed the essays better by reading them in the book than I would have had I read them online.he insight into the developer's perspective which could help the manager become a better leader.

In the last few years, books on CSS have crowded the book shelves as designers clamored to better understand how to use the mighty tool that blew away tables. This, however, isn't just another book on CSS its syntax, and positioning. It uses real Web sites to show how the designer did the work and why the designer took the specific steps or approach with the design. One hundred people can build the same site, but do it 100 different ways. Certain methods work better than others and the authors back up their decisions with clear explanations.<br /><br />Get the inside story on Blogger's rounded corners and rollovers; FastCompany.com's three-column layout; strategies for style switching; the process of revamping the giant [...] site from tables to CSS; the evolution of The University of Florida's site as many sites realistically evolve throughout the years, and a look at the structure of The PGA Championship Web site. Then the book ties it all together using Christopher Schmitt's personal site as the closing chapter.<br /><br />Don't expect start-to-finish walkthroughs and how-tos for the sites. This would take more than a book to do. The authors pick a few areas and hone in on them. The book as a whole should be enough to give readers an idea of how to work through a site from the beginning to the end. An intermediate or experienced designer can take her skills and knowledge to another level thanks to the thorough and clear explanations accompanying them.<br /><br />The first two chapters are different animals from the rest of the book. Chapter 1 is The Planning and Development of Your Site and Chapter 2 covers Best Practices for XHTML and CSS. Some people might find them a waste, while others might appreciate them. These two topics are better covered in the later chapters, as they look at the planning of real sites rather than dealing with theories.<br /><br />For instance, one chapter looks at how the decision to convert [...] to a CSS-based site came about. Additionally, the author describes how the three content modes (regular, skirmish, and war) are managed on the front page depending on the importance of the headline. 'Regular' mode describes basic news items - like who won the game, who got traded, and an update on a strike. 'Skirmish' typically reports on record breaking events while 'War' is the Boston Red Sox winning the World Series. This is planning and strategy. Because the information is tied with to a real scenario, readers are more apt to come up with ways to adapt the concepts for their own sites.<br /><br />The XHTML and CSS best practices chapter is more about the rules than about the best ways of doing things. Closing empty elements like the line break with a slash on the end like this  is a rule example. Creating left-side menus using list items instead of line breaks is a best practice. The chapter focuses on the former.<br /><br />The book closes with four helpful appendices. Troubleshooting CSS is the most useful. It has tips on how to find where the CSS \\"bugs\\" are - much like troubleshooting code. It also contains other resources where readers can go for help. This section is only a few pages long, but packs lot of useful information in a small space.<br /><br />Reading about the processes and techniques used in these projects taps into a collective of some of the best designers. The reader is a \\"fly on the wall\\" listening to the authors describe how they work - offering advice along the way that can be used in the reader's projects. Expect a few \\"ah ha\\" moments in which you suddenly find a better way to approach a challenge. After all, five heads are better than one.<br /><br />With five authors, some might wonder about the different writing styles. Since every chapter covers a different Web site, readers will find themselves more interested in the process and less affected by the differences in writing style. Intermediate and expert designers will find this solid book complements their other CSS resources nicely.rces nicely.	2005-09-16

Most of the essays provide a fascinating read, some more riveting than others. Only a couple are tedious.<br /><br />The essays evoke many emotions with the funny, heartwarming, sad, curious, and intriguing tales. Human nature comes through as these pages pour out the men's thoughts, the kind few human beings would share with their loved ones and friends.<br /><br />Topics cover the woman making more money than the man, the stay-at-home Dad, a marriage of equals, an almost 50-year-old man who remains a bachelor, a man who prefers older women, an open marriage, affairs, and less \\"Mood for Love\\" in a marriage.<br /><br />It's easy to dislike some of the men while respecting others, but their prose and candor provide impressive insight into otherwise ordinary situations in their lives. Hearing a story about a man who after 17 years of marriage and two kids isn't as chivalrous as he was when he first met and married his wife doesn't sound like much. However, \\"I Am a Man, Hear Me Bleat,\\" is a captivating tale in which one of his kids ends up in the emergency room under his care.<br /><br />The book doesn't completely answer, \\"What is he thinking?\\" While each essay addresses the question, there isn't enough diversity in these men's backgrounds. In fact, almost all of them are writers from New York or California. One author stands out because he's in jail.<br /><br />The book finishes with a bang with \\"Father of the Year\\" by Trey Ellis who is black, adding a little diversity (he's a writer, though) talking about fatherhood and his crumbling marriage. If another edition comes out, more diversity in terms of location, experiences, and careers will turn a fine book into a superb one.	2005-08-28

The writer looks good in the editor's eyes when turning in an \\"almost finished product.\\" Not only do you make the editor's work easier when rechecking your product, but also it earns you a better reputation.<br /><br />Writers aren't the only ones who benefit from Write It Right. The College Board's National Commission on Writing conducted a study that concluded a third of employees in America's blue-chip companies wrote poorly and businesses were spending up to $3.1 billion per year on remedial training (2004). Newspapers like the New York Times published the statistics from the report to show the gravity of the situation in the U.S.<br /><br />The five chapters in the book make up the five steps for self-editing. Each chapter ends with \\"Questions for Self-Reflection\\" to help readers determine what areas need working on, so they focus on those while self-editing. The first chapter ends with a grammar quiz, which is the book's paradox. It has two errors. One question misses a word that appears in the answer and another has a typo.<br /><br />While following the five step process feels lengthy, the authors include advice on what to do when in a hurry. Writers can judge how much to review their work and adjust the process as needed.<br /><br />The basic advice consists mostly of common sense, the things we learned in school or through experience. However, the book shows how to find your weak areas and work with them. The authors do an impressive job covering all the bases in this small book by tackling the editing process, giving a handful of grammar tips, and providing checklists. It takes less than an hour to read straight through without completing the suggested activities.<br /><br />This little guide has a good chance of coming in handy rather than sitting on a bookshelf never to see the light of day.

We meet the holy man who offers advice in a manner like a minister, a Rabbi, a priest, or any spiritual leader you know without focusing on any particular religion. Though some resources categorize the book as religion - Christian, it's not. In fact, the only thing it does is quote Jesus and Eastern thought on several occasions. The generic quotes apply to everyone, not just to those who believe in a specific religion.<br /><br />The book absorbs the reader. You can read it quickly or take it slow by indulging in a couple of stories at a time. Each chapter tells a tale and teaches a lesson. However, in the big scheme of things, there's progression from start to finish as a couple of characters appear throughout. For instance, if you read the last chapter first, it might not make sense or have as much meaning without having read an earlier chapter introducing several of the characters we see at the end. Once you've read through the book, you can go back and read a story of your choice.<br /><br />Joe, the holy man, has flaws like any human being. No matter how wise or spiritual a person becomes, human nature dictates our imperfections. Joe's mistakes makes him more endearing. The reader discovers the problems faced correspond to those we have encountered in our lives such as envy, egotism, grief, and anger. The stories drive the reader to smile, frown, be surprised, grimace, and laugh.<br /><br />You don't have to think hard or read between the line to get the message from each story. Just sit back, read, enjoy, and learn. Occasionally, you might run into prose that has little meaning, but read on and the message will come through. While the story compares to Chaucer's tales, it contains a trickle of modernization. Trott's writing style tells the story in a simple and easy to read manner, yet somehow the profound lessons come through effortlessly.ly.	2005-08-28

Stories cover the gamut of breaking cultural rules, losing a successful business and starting over, dealing with divorce, moving to a foreign country and leaving your children behind, facing a difficult situation when the kids love the nanny as much as the mother, and other topics that many of us would never dream of confronting. For those who have faced such situations, these stories remind us we're not alone.<br /><br />I don't know how to do these stories justice with this review. I feel like a friend sitting across from the author of the story, telling her tale as if I were her best friend because of the intimate details she shares.

Considering the book is categorized as business and self-help, the reader gets treated to an unexpected tale rather than what most expect when reading a business book. Some business books have used this approach and have been successful by teaching through a tale.<br /><br />The tale in Free the Beagle is open to many interpretations. The reader goes on the journey with a lawyer and his beagle. The two meet various obstacles and characters in every chapter, and each chapter could change your mind what the story tries to teach.<br /><br />While reading the story, try to enjoy for what it's about and avoid the temptation to over-analyze it. See where it goes and then read the transcript. Chances are at least one of the six individuals interpreted the story the same way as you. If you read the story a second time, your perceptions might change, especially after reading the transcript.<br /><br />The story covers hope, intellect, love, intuition, and faith that can be applied to business and life. These emotions are characters in the book and they represent their names. When the tale ends, one might think it's a nice story that could have several meanings. But the whopper and the book's gem comes in the last chapter with the transcript of the dialogue in which six individuals in various professions share their perspectives and interpretation of the story.<br /><br />There is one gripe with the story. The use of \\"Son of the King\\" is limiting. Many of us think of one thing when it comes to that reference no matter our religious background or lack of one. Using a different reference would help the book stick to its goal of leaving things wide open to different interpretations. Free the mind of the reference and let book guide you on an adventure without any preconceived notions. Even the other business books that use storytelling don't measure up to this one.	2005-08-28

Godin brought up this point in the book and it clearly explained what he means by \\"liars.\\" Of course, he didn't insult marketers as he belongs in that category. But \\"storytellers\\" would be nothing new.<br /><br />Though he didn't use \\"storytellers,\\" the book addresses how to use stories to help the business succeed. The book grabbed me at the start, but then it got slow in different parts. What I appreciated most were the examples of storytelling or \\"fibbing.\\" Godin did point out that fibbing doesn't mean the same thing as fraud. He provided two examples. Can you tell which Godin identifies as a fib and which is fraud?<br /><br />*A wine glass maker claims wine tastes better in his glasses.<br /><br />*A company says you can call anytime to hear the president of the company's voice and the voice introduces himself as such. It turns out the voice is an actor as the president died over 50 years ago.<br /><br />The second would be the fraud. It's a story that turns out not to be true and customers feel tricked when they find out. No one can prove the glasses don't make the wine taste better; therefore it's good storytelling because it leads people to believe the claim might be true and the product is worth trying.<br /><br />John Stossel of ABC News did a report on bottled water and discovered people are convinced that tap water is bad while bottled water is cleaner, safer, and tastier. The news report conducted a taste test of four brands and tap water. Tap came in third while the most expensive, Evian, came in last. And in first place? The cheapest bottled water, K-mart's brand.<br /><br />Telling a story doesn't guarantee everyone will be fooled into believing what you hope they'll believe, but the bottled water example proves many bought into that story.<br /><br />Godin goes deeper because telling any ol' story doesn't equal great results. Other factors come into play even before your product or service comes to life. Have you noticed cereals have new labels such as \\"100% whole grain\\" or \\"15% less sugar than the original\\"? What do you think drove the cereal manufacturers to change the labeling in some cases and to create a new formula in others? The low-carb craze. It was their way of staying in the game when much of the world changed its view on what foods to eat and what to avoid.<br /><br />Godin quotes Malcolm Gladwell whose best seller, The Tipping Point, no doubt led the way for his second book, Blink, and even recommends the latter work. Everyone I've talked to who has read both books has little good to say about Blink and some didn't think much of The Tipping Point. This praise is the only quarrel I have with this fine and thought-provoking book, but it makes me leery of the rest of the book recommendations (only 13 in all) because of this point. Technically his praise of the book could be called \\"fibbing.\\"<br /><br />The book provides examples of how small businesses, large businesses, and service-oriented businesses succeed with the storytelling approach. Any business can learn from the book's concept. It took little time to read and gave a good overview about how businesses create and sell their stories.efore your product or service comes to life.

After seeing the Game Plan page at the end of each chapter, I start reading the bulleted list first because it reviews the main points of the chapter and lets me know what to expect in the chapter.<br /><br />The handy glossary provides useful for the novice who may not be familiar with the terms used in the book and in the investment world. As always when reading any book offering financial advice, the reader must remember that the judgments offered are the author's and others might disagree with some of the concepts.<br /><br />Coach Yourself to Success is a great primer for new investors or those who have little or no knowledge about investments. It also provides good brush-up text for more experienced investors who may want or need to analyze their portfolios. As the author explains, you should continuously keep up and change your allocations as circumstances dictate. The writing is clear, the concepts simple and the advice down-to-earth and basic. Most individual investors will find the book a practical resource.	2005-08-28

The name change most likely came as the result of author Harriet Lerner's other Dance book titles - Dance of Anger, Dance of Intimacy, Dance of Deception and so on.<br /><br />Lerner uses her experiences, patients' experiences, and other people's experiences - a valuable way to teach what fear is as it has many meanings and situations that bring it on. She doesn't throw, \\"Do this...\\" out there or make claims you'll get past your fear in one day. Instead, she shares the stories of several patients who had to deal with a challenge over a period of time.<br /><br />Lerner covers rejection, anxiety, change, the workplace, looks, and when things fall apart. When it comes to addressing fear, only one thing is guaranteed - one solution does not fit all. What helped Anne Morrow Lindbergh cope with the loss of her infant son won't necessarily work for someone else.<br /><br />The message is that we all face fear in spite of our education, knowledge, courage, or any other characteristic that supposedly makes a person fearless. When we accept fear as a natural occurrence in our lives, we learn to deal with it better than if we didn't accept that.<br /><br />Some who see a book classified as psychology or self-help run away. It's understandable as such books can be too sugary sweet, too philosophical, full of annoying affirmations, or full of exercises. This one has none of these characteristics. Heck, it makes you laugh. It doesn't even mention OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and it has a drop of panic attacks, but not from someone who is dealing with panic / anxiety disorder. It's about the fear all humans experience, not just those with an illness.<br /><br />As a result of this book, I walk away with a better understanding of fear and its cousins, shame and anxiety. I'm not cured of anything. Instead I have gained insight into this strong emotion and should have a better handle on it the next time I dance with it.<br /><br />The Dance of Fear has none of the big words that Lerner learned in medical school. Instead of quoting complex theories, she uses meaningful quotes you may have come across. The outcome is a book that reads like a friend wrote it and who happens to be knowledgeable on this topic.xt time I dance with it.<br /><br />The Dance of Fear has none of the big words that Lerner learned in medical school.

What if I add the term \\"Apple?\\"<br /><br />For me, the famous Orwellian Super Bowl commercial comes to mind. Do you even remember who won the Super Bowl that year? Or even who played in it?<br /><br />Super Bowl commercials had yet to become the subject of water cooler talk in 1984. How strange is it to hear that Apple originally planned to run its commercial during the college bowl games only to move it to the Super Bowl because it was cheaper? The Apple commercial is responsible for kicking off the Super Bowl super ads that have stolen the show - especially when the game was a blowout.<br /><br />Why did this commercial receive such buzz? It's not like we'd never seen a good or different one before.<br /><br />Are you struggling to come up with an idea for a marketing campaign or any campaign for getting the word out there when your budget is limited and every media is overcrowded? Even in this day and age with TiVO skipping commercials and information overload, it's possible to break in. It takes creativity and pushing at least one of six buttons.<br /><br />Hughes shows which six secrets, or as he calls them \\"six buttons of buzz,\\" that Apple hit upon with this commercial. Not only does he talk about the six buttons, but also he covers the six steps to creating a buzz worthy campaign:<br /><br />The six buttons to creating successful word-of-mouth campaigns:<br /><br />  1. The taboo - sex, lies, and bathroom humor.<br />  2. The unusual.<br />  3. The outrageous.<br />  4. The hilarious<br />  5. The remarkable.<br />  6. The secret - both the revealed and unrevealed.<br /><br />The six steps to creating a campaign while integrating at least one of the buttons:<br /><br />  1. Push the right button.<br />  2. Capture the media.<br />  3. Advertise for attention.<br />  4. Climb the mountain.<br />  5. Discover creativity.<br />  6. Police your product.<br /><br />Hughes writes conversationally with wit, much like what you see in the high quality blogs and he easily engages readers. Hughes could readily spout marketing jargon, but he doesn't. Nor does he come across as a know-it-all. He genuinely wants to show how buzzmarketing works and backs up the six buttons and six steps with real life examples that experienced `super buzzing.' We need more business books like this.<br /><br />The examples include the Pepsi Challenge (I prefer Coca-Cola to Pepsi and have taken plenty of challenges to prove it), Rit Dye, Ford Mustang, and of course, Hughes' own campaign coup - [...]. It takes no time to read the book as it flows like good fiction. Whether your budget is small or large, the examples and ideas from the book show how to create a campaign worth much more without spending an extra buck.<br /><br />Do you hear buzzing? That's the sound this book is generating as the publicist behind it spreads the word to reviewers and bloggers. When I post a review, it doesn't just show up in one place. Expect to find it posted in two other places and linked to from two newsletters. Now that's spreading the word - or should I say `buzz.'

Leveen is the founder of Levenger, the company that sells \\"tools for serious readers.\\" Readers requested something that he couldn't provide and he attempted to do it with the book: time for reading. Talk about great customer service.<br /><br />The book didn't focus much on making time to read, but making the most of what you read. A book still bores you after 50 pages? Stop reading it. Try again later, if you wish. Books that turned us off at 16 might delight us at 30. Every year, we grow and gain experience, which might help us appreciate a formerly disliked book.<br /><br />I despised memorizing poems in school. But guess what? Some of those memorized poems later became my favorites. Kipling's \\"If,\\" Alfred Noyes \\"The Highwayman,\\" Shakespeare's \\"All the World's a Stage\\" from As you Like It, and Edgar Allan Poe's \\"Eldorado.\\"<br /><br />Leveen shared the process of experiencing a book, absorbing it, and making it valuable. He suggested writing notes in the margins. Me, the book preserver, hates writing in books. I hate it when I see marks, folded pages, or any damage to a new book.<br /><br />Leveen shared the perspectives of those who like to write notes and those who like preserving books. I could see the benefits of writing notes and such, but I just can't do it. The only time I ever did it was in college when I highlighted passages in textbooks. It didn't do much good, which is probably why I don't like to mess up a book. But I know writing notes isn't the same as highlighting text. I might give it a try. I didn't write in this book despite the encouragement.<br /><br />One thing I've been doing is keeping a list of books I've read. After reading this book, I went back through the list and added notes about each one (what I could remember anyway). I'm glad I started this list and of course, I wish I had started it sooner. My list (pdf file) is available so others can discover new books and authors just as I did because of the recommendations of others.<br /><br />Though I can't use audio books, I discovered the audio books chapter was worth reading.

It doesn't cover everything, but it's brevity makes it easier to read and it offers tips that many beginners and some intermediate writers won't know about.<br /><br />Queries are tough to do. I haven't had much luck there -- but I do mostly business-related writing since the work makes the best use of my time and I already have experience in this type of writing. \\"Query Letter Clinic\\" reviews what to do and what to avoid. It also shows a few good and bad examples of queries.<br /><br />The articles section of the book has about 85 pages.

It doesn't shed or have fleas. Best of all, it doesn't bite or do its business on the carpet. Parents can gladly get this pet for children. Of course, this book would never take the place of a real thing, but it's a pleasure to read it. I can read it repeatedly (as children always want you to do) and not get tired of it. A parent can't help but get into character while reading the book aloud.<br /><br />The book's insides have a felt / velvet feel, so it gives the child something to touch. It has a leash that can act as a bookmark or make it easy to \\"walk the dog.\\" The illustrations are colorful and well done. Adults and children will laugh and enjoy this one.<br /><br />The author does a superb job with his play on words. Big frog means BIG, human-sized frog. German Shepherd... not a dog. Literally, German sheep herder. It has a fairy tale feel with humor thrown in. I can't imagine who wouldn't like this book unless as one reviewer said, a person who has problems with witches in children's stories.	2005-07-16

Though Coco is 43, Ginger finds men including her own boyfriend ogling over her mother. While Coco wears anything and everything that appears daring, sexy, and outrageous, Ginger goes to the opposite extreme, dressing plain and not sexy, and she doesn't like to reveal herself even to her boyfriend.<br /><br />Ginger begins a new venture as she starts cooking school partly paid for by her uninvolved and unemotional father. Of course, she meets Tom in class and can't stop thinking about him, but the class ing&eacute;nue has already claimed him. To make things more difficult for Ginger, the instructor verbally abuses her making her feel like a lousy student.<br /><br />Coco no longer dances as she's old by dancer standards. She holds classes covering how to strip, dance, seduce, and generally feel good about being a woman. Ginger helps sell related wares at the end of class.<br /><br />Her father's wife passes away and he asks Ginger to help with her things. She sees it as an opportunity to get to know her father and her 13-year-old step-sister. She learns a few things about her father and his other family during the process.<br /><br />Women like Ginger hide their bodies and constantly doubt their looks, talents, or both. The characters in the story are diverse enough that a reader will connect to at least one of them.<br /><br />Meanwhile, since Tom is dating another woman, Ginger gets to know a talented chef. This scenario ensures you don't figure out who she ends up with, if anyone. So it's not your typical, predictable chick lit. The only thing missing from the wonderful book is closure on the dead step-mother's journal. Lehmann includes humor, conflict, and warm-hearted moments in her easy-to-read and pleasurable story.	2005-06-23

Conversion, and there isn't a better word to describe it, means action that leads to the results you want. It could be increased product sales, more newsletter subscriptions, contacting the business, or more registered users. CALL FOR ACTION is about improving the rates of what you want users to do.<br /><br />Many books covering Web design address usability and making it easier for the user. But no book that I know of shows how to get your users to take the action you want. A usable site doesn't guarantee action. CALL FOR ACTION moves beyond helping users find things easily and focuses on persuasion so your business can see an increase in its bottom line. Overstock.com experienced a five percent conversion increase by fixing one thing based on the authors' advice.<br /><br />The categories that make up persuasion design include planning, structure, momentum, communication and value. The book begins with an overview of the entire process and then digs in to each category along with its perspectives, strategies, examples, and conversion tips from experts in search engine optimization, online marketing, and usability.<br /><br />Researching and understanding the customers plays a vital role in this process. An example of this: you create a profile of three customers who have similar demographics, but come to the site for different reasons. After arriving on the Web site, these three customers go to a different part of the site. The challenge is to address the needs of all three on the landing page and then help them along to the next step through \\"scent of information\\" (leading the user to where he wants to go based on his persona).<br /><br />You won't find theories in the book. Instead, expect practical advice on online marketing so you can make the most of your users' time on your site. While most of the concepts are practical, it has heavy-duty stuff, too. Those more experienced with e-commerce will appreciate it. If you skip the more challenging concepts, the book quickly pays for itself with the implementation of an idea or two. I like the case studies, especially the before and after examples for both design and content. People who learn from examples will appreciate the diversity of examples covered in the book.<br /><br />CALL FOR ACTION thoroughly covers many concepts proving a challenge to provide you with an overview of what it's about. Anything you can think of having to do with online marketing and Web design is likely included.

Not only are computers covered, but also PDAs, cell phones, digital cameras and scanners. This is a well-rounded book with coverage on theft, backup and recovery, viruses, spam, junkware and fraud.<br /><br />If you're not into techie things, but want to keep your computer healthy--the book won't bore you. Quite the opposite, as the authors write with humor and down-to-earth feel. An example: after attempting to rescue a hard drive which continues to sputter, try the \\"defibrillator\\" method. It states to unplug the computer and remove the computer's cover, and then \\"yell 'CLEAR!'\\" and lightly tap the face of the hard drive. How can you not like a book with stuff like that?<br /><br />The authors clearly explain networking and wireless networking. Anyone befuddled by such topics will appreciate the book for those chapters alone. Some problems have simple answers such as, \\"Is the monitor turned on?\\" Hearing this from tech support might be embarrassing, but the authors don't talk down to anyone whether or not a solution is super easy or complex.<br /><br />The sections use a handwriting style font adding to the book's friendly nature and engaging writing style.

The new one has many changes that you won't recognize it. Whether you're a power PC user or a casual one, you will benefit from the book. Because of the wide array of topics covered, I can't imagine many geeks who know all of these tips.<br /><br />Instead of calling tech support and staying on hold or going to Google, check PC Annoyances for the answers. It's impossible to have the answers to all the problems you encounter on a PC, but Bass touches on a bit of everything. If you don't find the answer in the book, you might find enough clues to shorten your search.<br /><br />GMail joins the book and its tips immediately pay off. Other than the usual Microsoft applications, get stress-busters for fixing annoyances related to music, video, CD, and general email. Mozilla, Firefox, and Thunderbird don't make the cut this time. However, we know how the publishing industry struggles to keep up with tech changes. The book lists a few Netscape-related tips and what you can do in Netscape usually works in any Mozilla product since they're based on the same \\"bones.\\"<br /><br />How many times have you come across an interesting URL in a book that was a mile long and took several attempts to get it right? Bass takes care of that by using a URL shortening service making it easier and quicker to get the right URL on the first try. He provides links to software, humorous sites, and resources. After fighting a round with your PC, wouldn't taking a break by going to a funny resource release a few tense muscles? It does for me.<br /><br />His software recommendations include free and fee-based products. I recognize many of the programs and own some. Based on my experience, he provides excellent recommendations, so you can trust that he isn't looking to pump up his stock with any of the companies. Most, if not all, of the programs come with a trial period, so you can play with them and see if they meet your needs. If not, uninstall and no harm done. If so, then thank Mr. Bass.<br /><br />The only complaint I have lies with the warning boxes. They're dark blue with black text. Not easy to read.<br /><br />Bass writes likes someone who has battled with the annoyance and shares the solution. It's conversational, enjoyable, and easy reading.

But there's no mention of \\"11\\" anywhere. I click the \\"Page 11\\" tab, but it's not related. I find the worksheet list and it also references to \\"Worksheet 11.\\" I recognize several worksheets in the later tabs, but not Worksheets 13 and 14. The CD and naming convention needs improvement.<br /><br />The first step of changing XYZ Corporation to my company name doesn't work. I look at the CD again and click on \\"Financial Statements\\" and this time it takes me to the right place. Am I a dumb user? No. How do I put this without sounding like I have a big ego? I frequently write about technical topics and am comfortable with computers. Does that do it? Well, after switching to \\"Financial Statements,\\"  saving it to my hard drive to take it out of read only mode, and attempting the action again, the company name won't change.<br /><br />The next set of instructions has punctuation in the wrong place, thereby confusing the reader. This simple typo leads to an incorrect entry and a frustrated reader. A field name also has a typo, missing the \\"s\\" from \\"Names in Workbook.\\" That might look like small potatoes, but this is the second typo within the first four pages.<br /><br />Joseph Rubin knows Excel. I don't question his expertise. The concern is with the publisher and its editing process. I've been doing technical editing and these are typical mistakes that editors should catch because drafting perfect directions throughout a technical book like this one is impossible.<br /><br />Typos and incorrect steps aside, readers could learn new tricks and shortcuts as they complete tasks. Unfortunately, when a reader gets annoyed and can't make it happen, the book becomes useless. I suggest the publisher send the book through a strict editing process to catch errors and soften the writing. Rubin's writing style is stiff, much like that taught to business students learn to write, but nothing a good editor can't fix.<br /><br />I can't believe this is a second edition.<br /><br />Financial Statements.xls has potential with its real world spreadsheets and activities to work through them.

Going back and forth in time made for more interesting reading and there was an element of mystery about the characters from the past that made the reader want to keep going to see what really happened and to whom.<br /><br />The protagonist in the present was an adventuresome boy and I could imagine more stories of his exploits from the author. As an adult, I found the book a little simplistic and fairly predictable; still, I enjoyed the yarn and read it all. I think youngsters could picture themselves involved in this kind of exploration, doing a little detective work and  trying to figure out some of the unexplained happenings.	2005-04-17

Get your answers here	This book is for CSS haters, people frustrated with CSS, and those making the transition to CSS-based design. Other resources are better served for those who haven't touched an inkling of CSS. Once you have basic grounding in CSS, then come back to this one.<br /><br />Like the title implies, it's true you don't have to read the book from front to back; however, it flows well so it is possible to read it cover-to-cover. The introduction indicates the book is not a tutorial. The first chapter uses a different format from the rest of the book and provides a CSS refresher. The chapter is also useful for getting your CSS vocabulary straight with its describing CSS selectors, tag selectors, pseudo-class selectors, and class selectors.<br /><br />Every item in the book begins with \\"How do I...?\\" with the solution following. Tips, important notes, and warnings are sprinkled throughout the chapters. The book's layout is friendly for scanning and finding what you need. Screen shots and sample code support the content to help those who appreciate visual aids.<br /><br />A good way to use the book is while you're working on a site and you get stuck. For instance, you're working on a form. In the old days, many of us used two-column tables to organize the form. You want to do the same thing with CSS. Here you would refer to Chapter 6: Forms and User Interfaces and check out \\"How do I lay out a two-column form using CSS instead of a table?\\" Or use the index to look up \\"forms\\" and underneath is \\"two-column forms.\\"<br /><br />Andrew also helps you create CSS drop-down menus, something I don't encourage because it's problematic in many ways. Even so, I've written articles showing how to do this because it's a foundation for designing with advanced CSS techniques and helps you become more comfortable with CSS.<br /><br />[...] That's generous considering there are nine chapters in the book. Plus, the site has the codes from the book for downloading. What about the rest? Yes, it's worth it because the later chapters cover forms, CSS positioning (a biggie especially for designers struggling to drop the table habit), and techniques such as creating rounded corners with CSS that works across browsers.<br /><br />The announcement of IE 7 coming out late this year will have little impact on the book except in the areas covering browser-specific issues. It depends on what Microsoft does with the new version of IE. I suspect Andrew will release a new edition when the time is right.

Books	4	28	28	N	N	Great place to start when diving into the topic	This book is for those who like step-by-step directions accompanied by explanations of how things work. I learned many things using this approach. This book is a stepping stone to creating dynamic Web sites.<br /><br />Yank does a fine job covering a little of everything without overpowering the reader with too much. Anyone who has experimented with Perl, PHP, ASP.NET, MySQl, Access, some of them or all of them will like the book. Those who can write PHP and MySQL with little help need to find a more advanced book (don't have suggestions, but I am sure others do).<br /><br />I rarely ran into problems while following the examples. I've worked with other technical books and hit a brick wall at times requiring a call for help or serious research. While working with this book, I only got stuck once and immediately figured out the problem with a little research.<br /><br />Yank uses visual aids and avoids jargon when explaining the process of laying out the database tables. A reviewer commented that Yank missed important concepts regarding databases. This book is not meant to go into such details. There are other books for that.<br /><br />This book is well-rounded in covering all the necessary components of building a Web site using a database. While adding data, viewing tables, and querying the database, you're learning tasks that will come in handy for future projects.<br /><br />Not only do you get instructions for PHP and MySQL, but also advice on structuring code so that it's used effectively.<br /><br />If you've never installed Apache, PHP, or MySQL or can't recall how to do it, the steps for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X are in the first chapter. Since the latest edition covers PHP 5, the author addresses the differences in PHP 4.3. When working on the first PHP script, there is no \\"Hello World!\\" for a change.<br /><br />The early chapters provide a good overview of PHP and MySQL. By Chapter 4, the contents of the earlier chapters are integrated as the backend database connects to the Web page with PHP. The next chapters show how to use forms to manage, add, delete, edit, and search data. By midpoint, the reader has designed a database, organized it, created Web pages for the data, added administration pages, and administered the database. Yank also explains how to generate cookies and build a simple shopping cart.<br /><br />The appendices include MySQL syntax, functions, column types, and PHP functions to use with MySQL. The book has an accompanying Web site that includes errata and four free sample chapters. Having edited a few tech books, I know how easy it is to miss things when you're working on different computer set ups and application versions. Check the site especially since it has the code from the book. When running into problems, compare your code to the code from the site.<br /><br />One chapter has a challenge along with the solution (a couple of pages later, so you're not tempted to peek). Having a challenge like this in most chapters, I believe, would help cement the learning.

For a long time, I never modified the interface beyond choosing the tool bars I wanted to view. I frequently used the word count feature and added that to the interface. Since then, I've learned to modify it based on my needs so I can quickly access the most often used features. Tip #1 is all about that.<br /><br />Haven't ventured into macros, or at least not much? Get a crash course on how to create and run macros so you can use those included in the book and venture on your own. Savikas explains the basics at the 30-foot level while guiding the reader through the steps of creating and running a simple macro. Many of the hacks use macros.<br /><br />When clicking on a link to a .doc file from within a Web site, the file opens within the browser and editing it is difficult because many of Word's tool bars are not there for your use. Hack #8 puts an end to this nuisance. In \\"Building a Better MRU\\" (most recently used), take the MRU file feature up a notch and pump it up with a form.<br /><br />According to the book, most of the hacks work with Word 2000, 2002 (also known as Word XP), and 2003. It mentions some of the hacks work with the old Word 97, but the book focuses on 2000, 2002, and 2003. The last chapter, \\"Word 2003 XML Hacks,\\" begins on page 319 and is the only one specific to the newest version of Word.<br /><br />The book follows the Hack series model making it easy to use as a reference. All the tips offered are listed in the table of contents. If you like what you find there and want something heavily focused on macros, the book will satisfy your needs. Those looking for a manual with help for getting around Word and discovering some of its power are better off with a different book.<br /><br />Anyone who is comfy with Word and likes to fiddle with something a little more advanced will get just that. Try a couple of hacks at a time to build up your Word knowledge. Soon you'll be creating your own macros. Those who are macro pros might not glean much from the book.

This section finishes off with top 20 tasks for clearing the email cobwebs. Excellent start.<br /><br />If you're overwhelmed at the thought of following a 12-step program and spending more than a day going through each step, the time limitations section should ease your mind. It's a good way to begin, baby steps. Don't stop there, however. Make it part of a long-term program and pick up some of the habits it covers.<br /><br />I already use many of the tips, but that's no surprise as obsessed with organization as I am. Though I have implemented many of the suggestions, the book provides value because it offers a process for cleaning up as well as tips I hadn't considered. It took me years to come up with many of the tips covered. So don't wait years to figure it out yourself when you can get it right now with one resource, this book.<br /><br />Sure, it covers the usual, \\"have a firewall running\\" and \\"ensure your anti-virus program is running and up to date.\\" However, you'd be surprised how many people don't have either in place. This book would be incomplete without these recommendations.<br /><br />Though a majority use Outlook or Outlook Express for managing email, Duntemann discusses other clients including The Bat!, Thunderbird, Pegasus, and Eudora. Like many things in life, everyone has different needs when it comes to email. The author discusses four email profiles and mentions them throughout the book so whichever you are, follow the advice for that profile.<br /><br />Like the other books in Paraglyph's Degunking series, this one is easy to read and addresses the advantages and disadvantages of various tools. Anyone who gets the book and follows its steps will experience a leaner, cleaner email box and possibly a faster-running computer. Most users of all levels should benefit from this book. The only group that might not invest in it are those who know everything inside out about spam, viruses, malware, and adware and how to deal with them.ssibly a faster-running computer.

I believe I'm an average user, maybe a notch above. This means knowing some of the lesser known tricks, but not a pro at pivots or creating elaborate financial spreadsheets. I have used pivots, but nothing heavy-duty.<br /><br />This book is 820 pages, but half of it has room for notes on the left page that has Notes, My Tips/Shortcuts, and Related Tips for finding similar tips like the one on the current page. You can see what these look like in Amazon's \\"Search inside\\" feature. The book has 322 tips and even with as many pages as it has, it's surprisingly lightweight. I have books that are half its size and weigh more.<br /><br />I also like the bookmarks on the side of the pages. Finding the part of interest is easy. The first page of a part lists the subjects covered and their bookmarks. These subject bookmarks appear with their related tips for quick referencing. You can use the index to find what you need.<br /><br />Excel 97, 2000, 2002, and 2003 are covered. Each tip lets you know which versions of Excel can use it. In a majority of the tips, all versions are covered so no one with a specific version of Excel gets fewer tips than others.<br /><br />Part I addresses the new features in Excel 2002 and 2003. It's very brief, so those who have it already won't feel like they're paying for useless information. The price is appropriate for a book of this size with the tips provided and the Excel versions covered. I won't rehash what each part covers as Amazon's \\"Search inside\\" also lists them and the complete index.<br /><br />The writing is formal and stiff, but easy to follow. I had no trouble understanding the directions... most of the time. The screen shots fill in the gap when the tips aren't clear. Newcomers and seasoned users of Excel will benefit from the book. Those who are pros will need to study the table of contents using \\"Search inside\\" and decide whether or not the book meets their needs.

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability at Work and in Life	Books	5	73	81	N	N	Small book, big impact	After reading a few pages, I'm hooked. This book takes about an hour to read and has a lifelong impact. The title implies exploring other questions based on the original question. However, the real story is about personal accountability in work and life.<br /><br />Rather than doing what comes naturally for many of us and becoming defensive and pointing fingers, the book changes your mode of thinking from \\"It's his fault\\" to \\"How can I fix this?\\" For example, in a restaurant, a diner is waiting for his waiter to come to the table. He catches the attention of a waiter who says, \\"This isn't my table\\" and walks off. The diner can only hope the waiter went to alert the person who is responsible for his table.<br /><br />A waiter who uses QBQ thinking would help the diner rather than dodging the table just because it's not his table. Such action has positive results on both the waiter and the customer.<br /><br />In another story, a cashier pays for the customer's under $3 purchase as her register didn't have enough to provide change. This action resulted in the store getting 100 percent of the customer's business.<br /><br />The book grabbed me and I applied QBQ thinking the day after reading it.

The book is the first I've come across the history of black cowboys and since it's in fictional context, students might appreciate it more than reading about it in a reference book. The book teaches a few lessons regarding gender stereotypes and learning how to do something.<br /><br />I didn't find the book exciting. If I were in elementary school, I'd probably pass on reading the book. The nice thing about the book is its main characters are Black, and we need to see more diversity in children's fiction books. It's a good book for parent/child and classroom discussions because of the lessons it teaches. I debated whether to give it a 3 or a 4. It's more in between.	2004-11-29

Each recipe is a script, program, command, or piece of code for implementing within a large part of a whole.<br /><br />In CSS Cookbook, get recipes for using CSS to create pull quotes, to add a background image, to build various types of layouts, and to manage forms. It is not about building a Web site from scratch, but getting bite-sized markup for implementing pieces of the site.<br /><br />This book is for those who know HTML and have a basic understanding of CSS. Like any food cookbook, the recipes are there when you're ready for them. It's not for reading from cover to cover. When you get stuck on a problem or want to know how to create a printer-friendly page, refer to the recipe.<br /><br />The main issue with the book is its use of tables in some of the recipes. With the growing number of Web sites moving towards Web standards compliance, tables are finally going away as a layout tool. Their only purpose is for organizing data.<br /><br />Don't expect recipes on fly-out or drop down menus. This is not a bad thing as CSS is not the ideal way to create such menus as there are many problems with implementing them. So it is understandable why they were not included. If you want to learn how to do these menus, there are many resources on the Internet showing how.<br /><br />The book could use more recipes as others in the Cookbook series have 400, 500, and even 700 pages.

What works great for one may kill another. However, the book doesn't take that approach. Rather, it tells how it is starting a business and the rough road of dealing with VCs (venture capitalists). If you expect a positive spin on stuff that's hard to do. Read a fairy tale instead.<br /><br />Rather than abrasiveness and a \\"do this, don't do this\\" attitude, Kawasaki uses humor to explain the process. Anyone who has a small business including those around for a few years will benefit. When ready to take action, use this book as the manual that doesn't come with starting a business. Thinking about it isn't going to make a business successful.<br /><br />Every chapter begins with the GIST of it, an overview of what's to come. Each ends with FAQ, frequently AVOIDED questions, to review the chapter's content and drill it in deeper for better understanding and implementation.<br /><br />Get simple, but important hints on everyday business practices such as how to give a strong presentation. How many times have you sat through a presentation where each slide has over 20 words in size 12 point and the presenter practically reads the words adding little to what is on the slide? Kawasaki smartly covers the 10-20-30 rule. 10 slides, 20 minutes, and size 30 font. Making changes to the small practices can lead to reaching the next milestone.<br /><br />This book can be likened to a quick reference guide for starting a business and useful strategies: has just what is needed without heavy-duty or dry language. It is, however, larger than most quick guides, but a fast and easy read into the world of startups and dealing with VCs. If a VC isn't involved, the book provides valuable tools and ideas to help with any business. However, technology start ups seeking VCs will benefit most.<br /><br />Stuck on a business plan? Learn what is needed and not needed. Don't waste valuable time and use the book to do what's necessary without going overboard.<br /><br />If long hours and challenges aren't in the plans, then read a romanticized business book instead.

I've been using operators and special syntaxes in searching for a long time, yet I've learned a few new tricks from the book such as more syntaxes and ways to improve searching that I hadn't considered.<br /><br />I've had to learn most of the tips in the book on my own over several years. If I had this book sooner, it would've saved me time and have shortened some of my searches.<br /><br />Calishain shares principles for conducting various types of searches as one search method doesn't fit all. Though a Google fan, I don't use it every time simply because some other search engines better meet the needs of a search. You learn about the big picture of using search tools rather than focusing on one.<br /><br />This book stands out because it describes the process of doing it. It \\"shows\\" you. She uses an example and tweaks the search syntax while letting you in on her thought process. Once you understand the principles, the rest is easy and the book becomes a great reference for remembering syntax, Web sites, and when to use a specific search engine.<br /><br />Web sites that are excellent places to go for reference are listed in the book. I watch out for such information because we know Web sites come and go. However, these sites have been around for a long time and are reliable references.<br /><br />With so many pages and subjects out there, it's impossible to cover them all. Calishain manages to cover a good variety of topics enough to interest each reader. Example topics include people searching, news searching, jobs, finding local information, and genealogy. The table of contents should give you a good idea of what's addressed and tell you exactly what the book covers. If you like the table of contents, you should be happy with the book.<br /><br />Another reviewer pointed out you can go to [...] for more information and a sample chapter of The Principle of Onions.

This is a guy who has had a hit movie and a hit TV show. Not many actors can claim one of each, and yet, he suffers the life of a \\"has been\\" and doesn't enjoy the riches we all think famous actors of hit stuff enjoy for a lifetime.<br /><br />This guy has impressed me with his brutally honest autobiography. The people and industry he speaks of are the people you and I are likely to have heard of. It's the kind of stuff that could get you kicked out of Hollywood for good.<br /><br />Why would anyone want to read an autobio about a guy on a couple of hit shows who is a blogger? I can't answer that, but I can tell ya it is great reading. The people who would like this book are geeks, bloggers, Star Trek fans, famous people fans, actor wanna-bes, parents with step-kids, and Shatner haters.<br /><br />Despite his being celebrity, he's a guy who faces problems many of us do. Financial, a difficult ex who is no help with the kids, balancing a career and family, and finding the right job.<br /><br />His writing style is candid, conversational and comes across like a friend who is talking to you. Since he and I are parents, must mention that he uses a few cuss words. If you like his blog writings, you'll like this book - without question. However, if you've read every blog entry he has done, you've read most of this book. Furthermore, if you've read Dancing Barefoot, you've caught about a chapter's worth of this book.<br /><br />Trek fans, don't expect an entire book on his life as Wesley. Wheaton, the actor fans, don't expect an entire book about acting although it covers a bit. WWdN, you're getting exactly what you see in his blog.<br /><br />He might be famous and a hotshot blogger, but he has lived through many things you and I have, too. That's what makes the book a delight. This review may sound like one from a groupie, but my responsibility is to readers not to Wheaton.

Many buy such books and end up never opening them or maybe a few times before it's outdated. I admit I'm one of those people, but not when it comes to the weasel (picture on the cover) book. This is the book the professor assigned for one of my first Web design classes and it is responsible for my learning tables, CSS, and knowing when to make a graphics file .gif or .jpg.<br /><br />It's the most well worn Web design book I have in my collection and the only HTML book I ever bought. Thankfully, there is little that's changed in the format of the book because it wasn't broken. Robbins takes the appropriate steps to update it and expand the sections that are more relevant today.<br /><br />Expect an entire orchestra of instruments relevant to Web design, along with the specific details and tricks you should know. It may seem a bit much that Niederst covers HTML, CSS, SSI, graphics, multimedia, JavaScript, DHTML, XML, XHTML, WAP, and WML. However, she appropriately magnifies essential things while the advanced or \\"you may want to explore\\" topics are touched upon to give an idea of how it works with suggestions for further reading<br /><br />The book starts off by addressing the biggest challenge of designing a site that looks good in every browser and version. \\"Designing for a Variety of Browsers\\" has a two-page chart of various browsers and versions for the Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX environments, showing what each supports and doesn't support.<br /><br />The next chapter covers another source of frustration for designers, \\"Designing for a Variety of Displays.\\" If you monitor your Web visitor stats, then you'll probably notice that no size leads the majority especially with WebTV, handheld, and cellular devices accessing the Internet. There are screen shots of browser and system measurements and tips for designing for various displays.<br /><br />Chapter 26, \\"Flash and Shockwave\\" explains what it is, advantages and disadvantages, introduces you to the Flash interface, adding a Flash file to a Web page, and integrating it with other technologies. Flash is a whole different animal and the book gives you the big picture of how it fits with designing Web pages. The following chapter on SMIL covers the same basics.<br /><br />Part V addresses the advanced technologies including JavaScript, DHTML, XML, XHTML, and WAP and WML. It's useful to have these all close together at the end of the book to help you figure out which you may want to use for a Web project.<br /><br />As useful as special characters can be, I never remember what to type to make the symbol appear, though I know these now. Finding the special character chart is the only complaint I had from the original edition and not even the index helped me find it, so I had to tab the page. This has now been remedied with one of the best improvements of moving the special character reference chart to the appendix for speedy access. Other appendices in the book are listings of HTML tags, attributes, deprecated tags, proprietary tags, and CSS compatibility and support.<br /><br />As your design skills and knowledge grow, there is always a question that prompts you to open the book and get your answer. It holds true today as I retire the worn out book with a loose page thanks to a certain child and happily replace it with its new younger sibling.<br /><br />***3rd edition update***<br />The third edition took a bigger leap from the second than the second took from the first. Web Design in a Nutshell, 3rd ed., comes with a greater focus on Web standards and cascading style sheets (CSS). In fact, the book opens with a chapter on Web standards, whereas it was merely a footnote in the previous edition.<br /><br />Rather than a sole chapter on HTML, the markup chapter blends HTML and XHTML. The chapter comes with notes explaining the major differences between HTML and XHTML. The greater emphasis on XHTML ensures newer designers dive right into XHTML and improve their chances of designing standards compliant Web pages. Furthermore, the appendix includes HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 and 1.1, and CSS 2.1 references.<br /><br />Ajax and WCAG 2.0 have barely been around in terms of publishing time. While the Ajax process isn't new, but its terminology and popularity are recent. Both items are covered, albeit briefly. Had Robbins wrote the book now, Ajax would not likely get huge coverage as it's a little advanced for the book's purposes and target market.<br /><br />Accessible forms, mobile devices, internationalization, JavaScript with document object model (DOM), and document structure also gain more attention in the third edition. On the same token, the book reduces coverage of concepts that have gotten less attention such as the Web palette (Web safe colors), SMIL (synchronized multimedia integration language), frames, and DHTML.<br /><br />Part III is devoted to CSS, which contains 10 new chapters -- a must as CSS becomes a design standard not something to play with. The third edition superbly reflects today's Web development environment and still sticks to its main purpose -- helping new and intermediate designers get up to speed on Web design.

The book imparts this type of advice along with what topics or themes to avoid and how to approach themed-based contests.<br /><br />The book has over 80 pages of help plus an appendix of four examples of winning entries. John Howard Reid has entered 80 contests in 18 months as research for the book. He also runs a contest (which he mentions a few times), so he has the perspective of the other side, the person accepting and judging the entries.<br /><br />Creating a winning entry takes more than outstanding content.

In each letter, the original letter is presented along with Land's creative and hilarious reply to the spammer.<br /><br />That's what Land has been doing, replying to spammers, and in some cases, the spammers have written back and those are included in the book. He takes on the role of lawyer, doctor, pastor, casting director, and woman (Joan). He produces works of fiction (don't tell anyone) and for once, spam is fun instead of an aggravation.<br /><br />If the book is based on the Web site, why should we read the book? Here are the reasons:<br /><br />1. There are many letters; it's difficult to read more than a few online.<br /><br />2. It's great reading material away from the computer and the Internet.<br /><br />3. Laptops don't handle beach sand, ocean water, or other exotic locales very well.<br /><br />4. After a lousy day at work, who wants to get on the computer at home? Get a good laugh with the book instead.<br /><br />5. The book organizes the letters by topic and you can see which ones have replies from the spammers.<br /><br />6. A book doesn't make your legs go numb like a laptop on your lap while in the bathroom.<br /><br />7. No downloading time involved!<br /><br />You can try before you buy by going to the Web site and reading the letters. Also, check the table of contents. Bet you've many of them.

This book is unique in that it's written by a person who is typically on the receiving end of the releases instead of someone who has spent years writing and submitting them. I'm more interested in what the recipient wants than what the person who has written a ton of them thinks they want.<br /><br />Crilley is a TV news reporter in Dallas who shares his experiences in book that takes about an hour to read because it's fast-paced, grabs your attention and keeps it. That's how good these stories are and why they got Crilley's attention. Each chapter provides a few key points and those points are reiterated at the end of the chapter for easy referencing.<br /><br />The author is on target when he suggests honesty even when things are bad. If Clinton had come clean from the start of it, the whole scandal involving him and \\"that woman\\" might not have been the big deal that it came to be. The media is going to keep nibbling until it gets what it wants or arrives at the truth.<br /><br />Within moments of reading the book, ideas started floating in my head on how to bring more attention to a few things needing spotlight.

A good photo does make a difference. Again, with three kids, who has time to read a book or take a class to become one with a camera? This book fills that need.<br /><br />It has three simple chapters with quick reference tables in the back of the book. It's small enough to fit into your camera bag, laptop case, briefcase, suitcase, or jacket pocket. The chapters address what is it?, what do I do?, and how do I? questions.<br /><br />What is it? covers the basic, intermediate, and advanced features found on digital cameras. It's the shortest chapter as once you get familiar with the features, you won't need the chapter anymore and you still have roughly 85 pages of material to support you when you're out there trying to capture the world you see.<br /><br />Once you've conquered the buttons and figured out what most of the symbols and modes mean, you're ready to dig deeper into the features and gain control of the camera with answers to your what does it do? types of questions relating to exposure and Flash compensation, white balance, ISO speed, and resolution.<br /><br />The last chapter is more free flowing as you and the camera have become one. Get tips on taking outdoor and group shots including sporting events where players are moving fast. Capture kids, travel spots, and wedding memories with class. As kids grow up, you may not return to the same places, and weddings happen only once (we would hope, unless it's a renewal of vows).<br /><br />Adding this book to your camera tool bag is a step forward to better pictures and a better understanding of those fancy photography terms - which aren't a big deal after you read author Derrick Story's simple and clear explanations.	2004-08-07

That guy is cool! Hot and cool are opposites, yet they mean the same thing when talking about that guy. My Polish grandmother is going to polish her silverware. Amazing what a difference a capital P makes. The knight rides at night in the rain and gets pneumonia. Here we go again with weird English usage. Kn, n, and pn are pronounced the same.<br /><br />English has many rules not found in other languages. For instance, most languages use articles with every noun. A, an, and the aren't always chaperoning the nouns, which is a challenge for non-native English speakers to learn.<br /><br />English speakers are no help when they get their own language wrong. For example, many use anxious and eager interchangeably. When you're excited and can't wait to do something, you're eager. Anxious means feeling nervous where there is anxiety. If a child says, \\"I'm anxious about going to school,\\" is she looking forward to it or is she uneasy about it? It's the latter.<br /><br />The book covers this and other problems in the \\"Verbal Abuse\\" chapter. The infamous lie and lay; who and whom; farther and further; and bad and badly are covered. Did you know hopefully is used incorrectly? I've been guilty of it and it's hard changing the habit because it fits at the beginning of a sentence or acts like an introductory word. While we can start sentences with actually, thoughtfully, and happily; hopefully doesn't belong with the introductory clique. It's an adverb. O'Conner writes, \\"...introductory words that we use not to describe a word, which is what adverbs usually do, but to describe our own attitude to the statement that follows.\\"<br /><br />Would you believe that saying, \\"I'm nauseous\\" is incorrect? Well, if it's true, it means you make other people nauseated. Nauseous is the something that makes you sick. Those suffering from morning sickness say, \\"I'm nauseated from the nauseous pregnancy (or coffee smell, perfume, or whatever causes it).\\"<br /><br />O'Conner does a fine job of clarifying the problems and explaining the correct usage. In a few places, the explanation isn't suitable and the reader might not understand how to do it right after reading it.<br /><br />With chapter titles like \\"Therapy for Pronoun Anxiety,\\" \\"Comma Sutra,\\" and \\"The Possessives and the Possessed,\\" it's easy to infer the book adds a dash of humor. Having written a few articles on grammar with humor to make it fun and easier to remember, I've learned how hard it is to do it.

A call comes through, but the person doesn't leave a message. The CallerID shows the phone number and a company name, but it doesn't ring a bell. When I enter the phone number in Google, it provides three results (boy, talk about bad luck as a couple of companies who had the phone number went out of business) and I learn who called as the name that appeared the  telecommunications company who provided the service.<br />The Google API (application program interface) is not covered although it is mentioned as a resource. The purpose of the book is to show how to use Google from a non-programming and non-techie perspective. The authors have accomplished the goal. They briefly cover using Google on Web sites as a search tool and for Ad Sense.<br />Those looking for hard-core Google tips using the API obviously won't find it in this book. This is a book for all the non-programmers and non-Web designers.

Since I'm self-taught, I missed a few steps. Besides, there are many things you can do with MT especially when adding plug-ins.<br />For the person who has never touched a blog or MT in particular, the authors start at the beginning and keep things simple. Realistically, how do you write a book that meets the needs of the experienced while introducing the new users to the software? Experienced users will probably skip the first few chapters where it covers installation and setting up a blog. But the rest covering templates, plug-ins, managing archives, and adding features will more than provide enough to keep anyone busy.<br />Not only do the authors show how to use MT, but also they offer information on how to write and promote content. The book focuses on v2.x of MT. As I understand it, MT v3.0 doesn't have major changes and much (if not all) of the book is still valuable. You could wait around for a v3.x book, but by the time it comes out the software will have upgraded.

In reading the introduction, I was pleased to find the publisher had decided not to change the UK spellings, phrases, and even punctuation rules in the American version of the book. Hurrah! It would have been a nice touch to add a note regarding the differences in the rules of American and British grammar.<br />A couple of problems do come with leaving the British intact, however. A sign mentioned in the book is racist in American English and should have been omitted. Also present is the word \\"fag,\\" harmless in Britain, but a prejudicial term in the US. Not everyone realizes this.<br />Writing this review is stressful knowing the punctuation is going to be checked with a magnifying glass, while I remain true to what I have been taught. Here's an example of where we disagree:<br />Rule eight in using apostrophe to indicate the plural of words such as do, don't, but, and and. In reviewing my entire library of grammar-related books, a majority indicate the apostrophe is not needed when the context is clear. Thus, use dos, don'ts, buts, ands, Bs, CDs, and so on. Use the apostrophe when minding your p's and q's and trying to remember to cross those t's.<br />Truss clearly explains the purpose of ellipses and [sic], two items that have confused writers and readers. Since this book has given me a renewed and refreshed outlook into punctuation, I'm on the lookout for more grammar gotchas.<br />Those hemming and hawing at this review and the thought of saving punctuation won't want to come within ten feet of this book. Someone asked me if this would make a good book for learning the grammar rules. No, not this one. This is more for people who know the rules and need a laugh. It's the 'fiction' of grammar more than a how-to.<br />The author does discuss how things should be done, but it has essay-style writing about grammar. Hard to say which single book I would recommend to get for the rules since I have many on my shelf.e than a how-to.<br />The author does discuss how things should be done, but it has essay-style writing about grammar.

I'm a fan of your books!\\" Not all authors have a publisher to do the press releases and promotional material work or at least, enough to spread the news.<br />In Putting It on Paper: The Ground Rules for Creating Promotional Pieces that Sell Books, Dawn Josephson walks through the steps of developing a book marketing campaign with a press kit which typically includes and she covers all items: a cover letter, a press release, a mock book review, an author bio, a sell sheet, a catalog, a give-away item, and an article. However, it doesn't stop there. The advice isn't just applicable to authors of books. It's also valuable for writers who want to promote newsletters, services, and other published works.<br /><br />I've seen my share of media kits for books and products. Some don't have any benefit for my needs while others sounds like a stereotypical used car salesman trying to make the sale in an uncomfortable way.<br />Josephson walks the talk since her book, of course, came with a media kit and it's one of the better ones I've seen. Based on this, the book describes how to create a media kit like hers using questions and answers, key points, templates, and real-life examples using the templates. The examples are exactly what I like to see in a press release and other materials in a media kit.<br />Publicity is hard that authors and publicists print a general kit and send the same thing to everyone. That might make it easier, but it won't be as successful has tailoring the kit to the recipient's needs. With word processors that do mail merge saving us time, it shouldn't be a problem to give the target reader the information needed.<br />Creating promotional materials may sound dull, but the book actually gives it a fun spin with its 160 pages of solid advice. Applying the tips and ground rules from Putting It on Paper, any author or publicist run a successful book marketing campaign.e book actually gives it a fun spin with its 160 pages of solid advice.

Rambo. Brotherhood of the Rose. If you haven't read them, you may have seen or heard of the Rambo movies or TV miniseries. Who can forget Sylvester Stallone as Rambo in his black headband with his exposed sweaty muscular chest holding a machine gun with fury?<br />Impressive background aside, the knowledge that Morrell imparts is educational and constructive. He tells the story of the writer, Sterling Silliphant of Route 66, who influenced Morrell's career in writing. A story like that sounds dull, but Morrell tells it in a simple and gripping way like the rest of the book.<br />Morrell provides lessons on literary techniques: plots, structure, and voice. His technique of talking to himself and questioning every aspect of a story is a remarkably easy way to ensure the words and story have purpose.<br />Most writers don't have time to go to a writer's conference or take a class. This book is a class in itself without the annoying \\"how to\\" style of writing. I read this book over a period of several months, absorbing one chapter at a time. Reading it slowly was like getting a mini-lesson each reading session.<br />Not only does he offers tips on smarter dialogue and overcoming writer's block, but he also talks about the business of writing and what to do when a book is published. \\"Getting Published and the Business of Writing\\" alone is worth the price of the book. Every writer who publishes a book will benefit from this chapter.<br />Whether or not one is interested in screenwriting, the chapter on movies is a humorous adventure as Morrell dives into the red tape-like process for getting Hollywood to bring a book alive on the silver screen. Think writers whose books get Hollwoodified are rich? Think again as Morrell walks through the steps of where all the money goes and it ain't in the writer's pocket.<br />The genre of Rambo movies isn't my thing, but I'm Morrell's fan after spending time with this book. He's inspiring.time with this book. He's inspiring.	2004-05-16

Up against one \\"bad guy\\" after another, blindsided by the antihero Mironov, escort to an uncooperative Valeria Konstantinov, Josh outperforms the \\"other side\\" always staying one step ahead even when he isn't sure of the enemy.<br />The fast-paced book is filled with adventure, chilling situations, and a unique ending, not quite what was expected. Although, Josh works for Naval Intelligence, he doesn't have the mind set of following orders, probably why his military career was a bumpy one.<br />However, becoming an intelligence officer keeps him in the Navy while making use of his ability to think on his feet, make decisions under pressure and do what it takes to accomplish his mission. The situation in the opening chapter gives a good look into his character.<br />The story is typical of a spy thriller - interesting characters both good and evil, plots and plotters, lots of action. Josh McGowan, however, was able to kill without a second thought and equally capable of falling in love and feeling the emotions that come with caring for someone, makes the reader care about him. He has his vulnerable moments, which is how Valeria gets away from him by taking advantage of one such moment.<br />You find yourself not just worrying about how he will get out of danger, but also what will happen to him because of what he feels and what he does. Will he continue in his work? Will he be scarred by what happens? Travel with him from Washington to the Kremlin with stops in the ocean and Tokyo.

The title of the book immediately caught the eye of this organized freak. Get on board with this 12-step program, or rather processes, to clear out the cobwebs and garbage hiding in the chips of your computer.<br />Unlike most computer books, it's strongly recommended to follow this one from front to back rather than skipping around. Tying a shoe before putting it on a foot is not as effective as doing it the other way around. Though it's possible, it's not going to fit as well and it's harder to put it on.<br />The book focuses mainly on Windows XP Home and Professional.

One problem. When do we have the time to read them? This book simply won't let that happen with its short chapters, personable style, and valuable information on how to keep visitors clicking until they make the buy.<br />This book is the how. How to take all the theories and whys discussed by other authors and make it happen. I have trouble with theories because they don't help me visualize the application of such theories. This book stays away from whys and shows you how.<br />When I started reading the book, several big projects got thrown my way leading to late night reading being replaced by late night working. Every now and then, I took a break and breezed through this book reading many pages in a brief time while gaining new knowledge and a refresher in creative writing as it applies to online copy.<br />Non-fiction is my thing when it comes to writing. Over time, I have forgotten creative techniques for adding spice to copy. The authors jolted memories of high school English classes where we learned about the different poetic styles (iambic pentameter, alliteration, meter, etc) and to avoid using passive verbs. Not only that, but also they cover how to write for different personalities.<br />Already getting high traffic to your site? That means you know how to draw attention and interest. But, how are you doing in building desire so that they take action? Hmm... could that be the challenge? The authors drive toward long-term results by engaging your visitors and leading the way for them to get what they need and be satisfied with it.<br />I'm familiar with a few techniques discussed in the book, but many may not be. It depends on what you do with regard to the Web site. I understand making a Web site usable and getting visitors to the site. My Web site's weakness is converting visitors into customers. Marketing pros may succeed with creating a desire, but have trouble with visitors taking action. The authors cover all the areas needed to persuade via the Internet from \\"notice me!\\" to \\"be happy with me!\\"<br />Are you thinking, \\"More technology! We need more technology to make this work?\\" We've taken technology for granted, but all it can do is what human programmers program it to do. Technology doesn't know human nature. It doesn't know how to feel or need something. People do and can convey what they know with words. Words make the sale. Technology ensures the words get their say (by quickly loading the Web page and functioning the way it should) and to push the sale through the back-end process (taking the order, managing inventory, etc.). This is where conversion principles apply. The authors share simple processes for improving conversion rates.<br />A splash page is the \\"introduction\\" page to a Web site. It's flashy, colorful, and cool. But it's a waste of time. It gets in the way of the core material. Customers don't care how good your designers are, they care about what you can give them and that comes through words and good online copy. It's time for the online world to get what print mastered many years ago. The authors' witty writing style makes the book enjoyable to read without sacrificing wisdom.

Oh boy, nine publishers from which to pick. 27 tips for finding the right publisher are at the end of \\"The Publishers!\\" for guidance on the process.<br />Sansevieri also covers setting up the business.

This is concisely covered in \\"Stuff to Do before It's a Book.\\" Get inside tips on actual publishing including POD publishers, covers, images, book titles, isbins (that would be ISBNs), copyright (ick), agents, and the keys to Amazon's secret hot spot.<br />Tooting your horn is a challenge especially since marketing isn't something to leave for the stars or publishers to handle. We think and dream about our books around the clock, but publishers and their PR people don't. Their focus is spread across many authors and books. Only authors can be sure the marketing gets done and done right.<br />The marketing section walks through media kits, press releases, expert sheets, postcards, reviews, book clubs, catalogs, and endorsements. Don't panic! The chapters in the book are short and all meat. When it's time to do a press release, open the chapter, follow the instructions, and it's done.<br />As soon as the last sentence is written, authors feel the load lighten and begin to think of the fun part of writing a book, interviews and appearances. Maybe for some, it's frightening, but think about the people who hear about your book and go buy it straightaway. Thinking big comes too easily especially with the Holy Grail of TV, The Oprah Winfrey Show. Appearing on her show has become a surefire way to a best seller. You and every author in the United States want to chat with Oprah. Sansevieri provides clues for approaching Oprah and other media outlets. She goes as far as naming names and listing contact information.<br />Staff turnovers and address changes do happen and the information is bound to be out of date at some point. That doesn't make the book any less valuable.

It answers questions of \\"How do you create a Purple Cow?\\" \\"How do you make something sell itself?\\"<br />When we buy cereal, especially kiddie cereal, what's the best part? The free prizes inside, of course! That's the thinking behind the book.<br />Free prizes aren't just the stuff you find in cereal or Cracker Jack. Does your credit card offer free airline miles or money towards the next car you buy? That counts. What about an online store offering free shipping? What I remember the most about some tradeshows and expos are the drawings for free prizes, the goodies I received, and the shirts I still have.<br />This book has impeccable timing. As an editor of a newsletter, I have been struggling to find ideas to pep it up and draw in more subscribers since new subscriptions have slowed down. I cheat and go straight to page 131, the start of the list of \\"Edges\\" and look for a spark of creativity to create an \\"Edgecraft\\" (book's buzzword) to find a free prize. The goal is to find something to reel people in, to give them something they want like the previously mentioned examples.<br />I learn from examples and Godin lists plenty of them using Edgecraft in action. He is not saying you have to invent something new to make something happen. It's about taking what you already have going and how to make your product, service, head, blog, whatever worth talking about and watching the results.<br />With three kids, a spouse, two jobs, a house, and volunteer work, finding time to read a book is a challenge. Even if I weren't a book reviewer, getting through this book would be a breeze because (a) it's 183 pages (the rest are detailed endnotes with references and explanations), (b) it highlights plenty of key points for easy scanning, and (c) each section or idea is short.

His writing about her provided a glimpse of Wil (he would want us to be on a first name basis - after all, I am older by just a notch!) as a nephew who cared about his aunt. He experienced the thoughts and feelings we did when a loved one died.<br />Ironically, I was sitting outside watching my kids play on a perfect Texas afternoon when reading about his playing Hide-n-Seek with his step-sons. While playing the game, he went back in time remembering different parts of his life. Of course, this led me to do the same in recalling the bike rides in my neighborhood and playing kick-the-can at camp.<br />The sweet yet simple moment between him and his wife in the rain upped my respect for him. Hollywood marriages failed left and right, faster than a blink. Something about his words said this was real.<br />Wil got a nasty brush off on the STNG set setting off &quot;office gossip&quot; where everyone knew about it.

I would assume 56k, but assumptions are not reliable.<br />At 800 pages, you can expect all the features to be covered through step-by-step instructions, notes, and screen shots.

However, I've never been one to knock recommendations for non-free products because I believe if we like something, it's good to let others know about it. If it's in print, it durn well better be a good recommendation.<br />You're a geek asking if you can find the answers on your own. Probably. But do you have the time it takes to find it? Probably not. Between the spouse and me (hardware and software geeks), we are learning a few good tricks from the book.<br />The book's format lends itself for quick and easy scanning with side notes in the light red shaded area on the sides of the pages, useful screen shots, and boxes with tidbits. The book is just 177 pages, enough for you to find the tips you need without the needle in the haystack problem.	2003-11-22

Apply that to the more technical subject of Web sites and it's scary.<br />Whether the economy is strong or in a slump, there's always a company with a shrinking budget that requires cutting funds for the IT and other departments. Furthermore, companies are creating a standard budget for their Web sites like any other portion of their business and they don't get the outrageous amounts of money like those who did in the `90s. With much of the cost going towards hardware and networking, Web managers are stuck with the short straw and have to make do with the little resources they have available.<br />With the availability of quality free or low cost software and guidance from Web Design on a $hoestring, these Web sites can survive and even thrive. Doing things on the cheap isn't limited to software as project management, team involvement, content, and technologies have an equal hand in building a successful site.<br />While the most of the advice is common sense, Bickner offers a few tricks most people even the tech-savvy may not consider. For instance, many shy away from CMSes (content management systems) because of their high price tag. Disregarding CMS is a mistake with the viable and affordable solutions available, but it doesn't mean going shopping and just looking at the price tags without paying attention to the features. The process is similar to purchasing a computer in that it's important to determine what features are needed before shopping. \\"Content Management on a Tight Budget\\" describes the features to consider and offers suggestions for bargains.<br />It's tempting to skip user testing and save the bucks, don't do it. Use the suggested workarounds for conducting tests without sacrificing cost and quality. Layout, markup, and images may not sound like something to worry about when under a tight budget. However, it's how they're used that can make the difference when it comes to bandwidth costs.<br />Buying this book is cheaper than spending resources on researching and brainstorming waves to save money. The book also saves time in providing a handful of resources for various categories such as CMS. So rather than searching every CMS in the world, use the material to narrow down the search and start from there. No starting from scratch. The book provides the necessary support to get the design team working on solutions right away.can make the difference when it comes to bandwidth costs.<br />Buying this book is cheaper than spending resources on researching and brainstorming waves to save money.

That's why we get stuck in a writing rut. Oh, computers? OK, then, blame the broken keys on the keyboard! Meet the enemy and the enemy is us. Writing a book review is always tough because it begins with staring at the ugly blank white page (or other color if you changed it) and you don't want it to sound like the dozen other book reviews you've written with the usual, \\"I like this book because... the author discusses... in chapter blankity blank...\\"<br />Well, I'm going to write that boring phrase and say I like this book because Glatzer writes like a buddy who supports you with humor without the muckity muck or eye-ball rolling advice. It's not a book full of nothing but writing prompts, although she sneaks a few good ones into each chapter. Yes, there are a few exercises, too, but not the running the treadmill until your feet fall off kind except for that one nasty guilt-trippin' reminder saying exercise can help clear the mind.<br />In a few instances I find myself saying, \\"Oh yeah, that's happened to me,\\" or \\"That makes me feel better knowing that.\\" The Myths from the Meanies addresses those hair pulling rules we hear from other writers like we must write every danged day. Relax, it's not written in stone nor is it an unwritten rule. For every myth, you learn why it's a lousy rule and how to deal with it. It took a load off my shoulders.<br />Do you moan and groan when people speak of yoga, meditation, feng shui, and all that? Those are mentioned in the book. Wait, don't groan yet. I do tire of such talk and the chapter on this talk is needed or it wouldn't be a complete book. It's not so bad and the advice is easy to implement. It's just an itsy bitsy chapter, which also mentions music and animals. How can you not like that? Yyyyyyyyy-M-C-A! At the Yyyyyyyy-M-C-A! Sorry, I got distracted by the music that is helping me work.<br />Get ready for chills down your spine as we dive into the deadline chapter. Writers know this is a necessary evil of the job, but it's also a good thing. The usual meet your deadlines and pad your schedule advice is there, as well as other good thoughts you might not have otherwise considered.<br />Feeling guilty for not writing most of the past summer because of an illness, Glatzer eases the pain in Chapter 17: It's Not You, It's Me. Though I'm finally back on track with my writing, thoughts of the lousy summer still eat me. Not anymore, thanks to the chapter. It's OK to go on a hiatus for whatever reason. The tips in the chapter can help most writers get through difficult times.<br />Usually, I don't enjoy reading about writer's block because I fear it'll make things worse. Outwitting outwits, outlasts, and outwrites other books on the topic because it's funny, clever, pleasurable (there is even reference to s-e-x... so it's no G-rated book!).

The name Hacks in the series isn't synonymous with \\"bad\\" because a hack is also known as a trick or add-on for adding more power to a program or system. The tech-speak is kept minimal, which makes the hacks easy to read and reference. The series has tips for beginners, moderate users, and experts and each hack is represented by thermometer's temperature (high for expert and low for easy) for easy reference.<br /><br />Amazon lives up to its name as it has grown to Amazonian proportions with the addition of apparel, toys, sporting goods, wish lists, reviews, listmania, and marketplace. That barely scratches the surface and it's easy to overlook many of its features.<br /><br />The first part of the book provides hacks for customers as chapters 1 through 3 address browsing, personalization, and community. Each product's page is flowing with plenty of details. The first few pages of the book explain the features that typically appear on a product page. Products have a unique name and it's not just the product name, but rather an ID in the form of an ASIN. Knowing the ASIN unlocks many shortcuts.<br /><br />Many of us, me included, have probably made it a habit to just enter the product's name in the search box and go. A couple of hacks demonstrate how to search more effectively to get the results you want and fast.<br /><br />One of the powerful features of Amazon is the ability to adapt to your preferences so it can make recommendations. Fine tune those recommendations and check out the movie show time listings. Be on time with birthday and event reminders.<br /><br />\\"What do you want for your birthday?\\" It's not always comfortable to answer that question, so Wish Lists come in handy. You can do much more than just add items to the wish list. Get hacks on prioritizing it, adding multiple items, and managing it.<br /><br />If you've posted reviews or created lists, then you're already part of the Amazon community. Since you're reading this review, you must value such reviews in helping you decide whether or not to make the buy (I hope this helps!) Chapter 3 covers the community features of reviews, Listmania!, guides, friends, product advice, and sharing the love. Those familiar with these features might be in for a surprise on additional things they can do.<br /><br />Amazon isn't the only one that sells products as anyone can be a seller or an associate as explained in chapters 4 and 5. Explore behind the scenes of selling with details on billing, inventory, and marketing. Get the lesser known secrets for developing a store and sharpening recommendations for improving linking and referrals.<br /><br />Just one chapter covers Web Services, so customers and sellers not interested in it won't feel slighted when they buy the book and have no use for the last chapter. However, the introduction will help anyone better understand Web Services and what Amazon can do with it.<br /><br />Though the book does its job in acting as a help manual for understanding Amazon's features, it does more by sharing tips and tricks you might not have considered until reading the book. My knowledge of using Amazon has grown over the years and the book pleasantly surprises me with things I didn't know.

Most writers won't wonder what book I'm speaking of since it's THE BOOK.<br />The first 100 pages or so contain articles and advice while the rest is markets, markets, markets. These articles include agents, pricing, interviews, building a career, and queries. Writers have been complaining about one critical item that's missing from the 2003 edition. It's back. Yes, the \\"How much I should charge?\\" article is here to rescue writers (me included) who struggle with pricing. The article has seven pages worth of gold with going market rates sorted by categories. Scan these 100 pages as soon as the book arrives in your hands to put the advice to immediate use.<br />Copyright issues make me crazy. \\"The Business of Writing\\" defines terms relating to rights and provides a brief overview of selling subsidiary rights and contracts and agreements. It's a painless five to ten minutes read. Online markets have pounded writers with more confusion over rights and rates. \\"Strategies for Negotiating Electronic Rights and Rates,\\" untangles the web.<br />If you own an older version of the book, this one is still worth the purchase. It has 1,100 new listings and contacts change often with people moving around within the industry and to new locations.<br />For those who have never seen or heard of this book, read the first article in the book, which takes you on a tour of what's in it and how to use it. The markets cover 300+ agents, book publishers, magazines, journals, scriptwriting, contests and awards, and resources making this a valuable paperweight or doorstopper. Inside of the front and back covers is a key to the symbols and abbreviation to help you make heads and tails of each entry.<br />Each listing comes with contact information, pay rates, statistics, tips on how to deal with the resource, and details on the publisher's needs. The agents sections provides terms, recent sales, representation type (subjects, fiction, etc.), and member agents.<br />We get too busy to read books. This is not a book you need to make time to read. When you come up with a brilliant article or manuscript, search the book for possible publishers to pursue. It's a heck of a lot faster than researching online or at the library.<br />This baby with over 1,000 pages pays for itself with one cheap article.

Each chapter ends with a checklist covering the various aspects of the test process from planning to intrusion detection. Organizations with a process model in place such as CMM (Capability Maturity Model), RUP (Rational Unified Process), and Six Sigma will find the material supportive of such efforts and maybe even making it easier because of the lists of example tools and software products for managing reporting and schedules.<br />The book isn't a read front-to-back book as each chapter is understandable with or without previous chapters. The first two chapters address vocabulary, test plans and planning, and general project management activities. The meat of the book is in Part 3, Test Design, beginning with chapter 3, which addresses scoping and conducting a network assessment. Chapter 4 focuses on system software and related tools.<br />The next two chapters look at client-side and server-side applications to ensure the system is designed to function correctly for its users while guarding its castle to prevent the evil ones from breaking in. Mother Nature might pay a visit or another big blackout could happen and those guards need to be prepared to react, hence Chapter 7 prepares a team for such events as well as various ways the bad guys might do a sneak attack.<br />Mysterious intruders and audit trails sounds like a case for Sherlock Holmes as Chapter 8 directions on detecting unauthorized intruders, responding to an attack, and assessing the damage.<br />Those who haven't formed a team might want to leap into Chapter 9, which provides staffing options for in-house and outsourcing. It also discusses the process of selecting tools. In the last chapter, get the lowdown on doing a risk analysis to be prepared in for the likelihood of changed plans (which we know happens often). Doing such an analysis is a step toward to having a well-planned test schedule ensure the areas that pose the greatest risks are done early in the process while the lesser important items are done near the end of the test period.<br />The appendices provide an overview of network protocols, addresses, and devices; a list of the most critical Internet security vulnerabilities; and example templates for testing documentation. Those who need more in-depth information can reference the resources for further reading via books and Web sites.<br />If the thought of security is daunting, this book is a good introduction to the topic. It's appropriate for organizations creating a new testing team; teams responsible for conducting testing assessments; and testing managers, project managers, and test teams that are new to testing security. Directors, executives, and other top level managers who are responsible for Web site security will also benefit.<br />Any technical terms that pop up are clearly defined without the dull writing that makes eyes glaze over when reading a technical book. The use of sidebars, checklists, headers, examples, and figures provide a nice balance in presenting the material without losing the reader. The book is practical for anyone who needs a general reference on Web security and wants to know how it works.<br />As for the programming issue another reviewer mention, it's true there isn't reference to programming languages.

Imagine the possibilities especially researchers, students, writers, professionals, and anyone who need to find specific or obscure information just by learning a few tricks. Entering _book reviews_ pulls out any resource having both words in it, not necessarily together as a phrase. Add quotes to \\"book reviews\\" and the results display sites with book reviews together as a phrase. This hardly unleashes Google's power. Even entering the keywords in a specific order can affect the results.<br />You can search around Google's Web site to learn lesser known tips and tricks, but you won't find most of the hacks on the Internet without, ironically, hard searching. As a fervent reader, too often I read well-written books and never take the time to apply the tools and techniques.

When reading documentation explaining the features of functionality, it doesn't always make sense until seeing it in action. For instance, in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) font type is explained as:<br />{<br />font-family: &lt;font face&gt;<br />}<br />That isn't going to make much sense to many of you even if you know CSS. What if I gave you an example of:<br />{<br />font-family: verdana, arial, georgia, sans-serif;<br />}<br />Obviously, the &lt;font face&gt; is represented by the font names separated by commas with the first font taking priority. If the user's computer doesn't have verdana, then it tries arial and so on until it finds a font loaded on the user's computer.<br />Designing Websites for Every Audience starts with a chapter on usability with a focus on understanding users and the principles of usability. That's the only lecture of the book and the rest is case studies.<br />The book has 25 case studies sorted by user goals, which include learners, shoppers, connection-seekers, transactors, business browsers, and fun-seekers. Each case study covers the old site and the transition to the new design. Essentially, a before and after, which is popular these days with interior design TV programs.<br />The case study pages are easy to scan. Every one has the company information, site information, users with their goals and tasks, goals of the redesign, and pictures. Benum uses a variety of Web sites for the case studies and discusses the problems with the old design.

A small star is clipped only because of the first two chapters focused on psychology of performance, theory, and background. Some people love the stuff like marketing professionals, but I'm not one of them. The rest of the book is solid gold... actually, platinum.<br />When we speak of usability, we typically speak of navigation, architecture, legibility, linking, screen size, and browsers. Also key is optimizing your site for fast downloads and this is more than just optimizing gif and jpg images. More people on broadband? Maybe, but not necessarily. Even broadband users have their limits in how long they will wait for a page to load. It's a business problem since it impacts revenue.<br />Been designing for less than a year? More than four years? Not even a designer, but involved somehow? The book is for all levels and anyone who has a hand in a Web site including decision makers. Experienced designers may have many of the optimization techniques down, but the book brings up others you may not have thought about. I've had my own Web site since 1993 and learned a few new tricks.<br />Andrew King has written about Web design for a long time and walks the walk as well as talks the talk. He has used his own Web site, Webreference.com, as a case study many times to show how to improve the site design. One reason he and Webreference.com have been well-respected is because everything is in reader friendly English.<br />Another book? No time to read it? The book is organized to make the most of your time. Use it while you're working on the Web project and refer to it often. You'll understand what King writes the first time and not have a need to re-read it until it makes sense.<br />If the words HTTP, client, server, and compression sound too techie, King's writing style has a calming effect so readers can understand and apply the concepts. Sites of every size and kind will benefit from this complete reference to create Web sites faster than a speeding bullet. We're all suffering from information overload, including broadband users, get to the book quick.ster than a speeding bullet.

Books	4	7	7	N	N	Doctor tells it like it is without sugar-coating it	I have the traditional expecting books and got this one with the second pregnancy. It answered many questions that I had forgotten or didn't learn during the first pregnancy. The entire book is a question and answer book sorted by categories. Each question and answer is numbered and referenced in the index.<br />On the third pregnancy, I knew enough not to get out any books until about the 15th week. There were a couple of things I needed to check and I went right for Thurston's book though I have some other good ones.<br />Get answers on what medicines are OK to take (it's always good to check with your doctor because better medicine may be approved for pregnant women by now), why things are happening, how to handle annoyances, and more. There's a great fold-out chart that shows every few weeks of pregnancy, what to expect, how you're feeling, etc.<br />I understand why one of the reviewers indicated that the attitude was &quot;flippant,&quot; however, Dr. Thurston is just telling it straight. Some of us are tired of sugary advice that doesn't get right to the point.<br />I admit that he made my second delivery better and easier than the first. Prior to that, he helped me through a miscarriage. Currently, I'm using a different doctor thanks to insurance. The new one is terrific, too... something about Thurston and the delivery he did, made me feel like I would always be well taken care of.	2002-11-22

After reading it, I was surprised it won. The illustration is as beautiful and high quality as we've come to expect in Wiesner's stories.<br />I love old-fashioned tales with a twist like \\"The True Story of the Three Little Pigs\\" and this one tries, but it's not easy to \\"get it\\" when the pigs fly out of the pages and into the pages of nursery rhymes (for two pages) and another story that I didn't recognize.<br />The story gets choppy once they leave the traditional story and it doesn't quite make sense to an adult the first time much less a 4-year-old. The words just don't flow well when exiting the traditional story.<br />On a brighter note, my son has been asking us to read it anyway (I think he likes the pictures), so we didn't completely waste our money (that and it was the school's book fair).	2002-11-22

You and your small business can get a bit of help with this book and leave the far too complex problems for the technicians. Not to worry, this is not a technical book nor does it use jargon.<br />You probably don't have much time to read books as a small business owner or a manager of a small tech shop. I'm in the same boat and I got through the book faster than I get through most non-fiction books because of its excellent and scannable layout. There are 101 tips in the book and the back of the book has them all listed for quick referencing or you can go to the section of preference: hardware, software, and data protection.<br />Each of the 101 tips headlines the page followed by two things: Save on Soft Costs and Save on Out-of-Pocket Expenses. A checkmark by these items indicates the kind of savings to expect from following the tip. The tip has headers and short paragraphs to enable quick scanning.<br />Already comfortable with computers?

This is not the start of a joke, but an introduction to Berlin-based Designershock design group's DSOS1: The User's Manual, a guide to their eccentric and abstract world where they're known for their Internet experimental electronic experiences.<br />Not knowing where to begin except at the beginning, the beginning of the book sets the tone, \\"Unless you're very strong, please resist the temptation to flick, browse, skip or skim. Start by going from page to page sequentially. Linear experiences are still the most satisfying, and this way you may remain calm and focused.\\"<br />Using a polyglot of colors, pages splashed with shades of reds, grays, and blacks guide you through three parts (from left to right on the screen):<br />Electronic Workmates (EWM) - an introduction to the accompanying software, which is the key to accessing DSOS1's online world that is exclusive to owners of the CD-ROM tool.<br />Electronic Playmates (EPM) - fonts and typographical games to die for and each time you win, you get to download fonts and other tools.<br />Electronic Decomaters (EDM) - \\"is about creative control over your environment. Taking it; losing it. How to open the window on the sublime.\\" Create an ambience with screensavers, wallpapers, and icons.<br />At first glance, this book seems cryptic, threatening and confusing. But remember what the introduction says and take it one step at a time from the beginning. It becomes easier to follow along with the print after connecting online. Designershock successfully leaps into the innovative world of combining print, screen, and typography.<br />Load the DVD and let Ozzy, the DSOS1 avatar, take you where you need to go to register for the first time and get a four-digit pin number. The user manual also outlines the steps to get started. EWM is on the left column, EPM in the middle, and EDM on the right. Pick online or offline tools, the latter downloads an archived file for playing offline. Offline is the better choice since it takes time to load the online version.<br />DS MEEK (Modulated Esoteric E-Type Kreator), a Flash program and the first in the book, lets the user manipulate fonts based on grids. The first impression is overwhelming, but the HELP and the user guide clearly explain the background and how to complete the activity. Turn the dials, flip the switches, and press the buttons to transform, morph, and scale a letter and apply the changes to the entire alphabet to create your own fonts. The book shows creations from using the MEEK emulator. One word: awesome!<br />Saving and loading a previously created doesn't work, at first. The save dialog box won't open, but attempting it another time is successful. According to instructions, \\"The SAVE and LOAD buttons work a little differently, depending on whether you are using the on- or off-line versions of the tools. Online, every user can save up to 10 modulations and 10 layouts on the DSOS1 server, using a simple DSOS1 file dialog. Offline, users can save and load an unlimited number of MEEK files, using normal system file dialogs.\\"  There two types of saved files in MEEK: layout and modulation. After printing a Meryl font creation, the program wouldn't go back to the EDIT mode or any mode. Just stuck there in font space. Despite a few runtime flaws, one could get hooked on this stuff.<br />Next activity, the DS EWG, has a few added features not in MEEK to increase the complexity. Hence, the user guide's wise suggestion of working through the book from beginning to end.<br />Expect nothing to come easy when playing the games, but that will make the rewards all the sweeter. This interactive print medium and accompanying Internet webzine slash software is not for the faint of heart or in this case, beginner designers.

You search the Internet for the scripts and can never find the exact one you want or even close enough to do tweaking. Perhaps, it's time to try an alternative and just buy a book on the subject and dive in.<br />This book is for beginners and intermediates who are comfortable with HTML and lack the time to learn how to implement JavaScript from scratch or without resources. Negrino and Smith set up the book by the &quot;things&quot; you want your Web site to do rather than walk you through all the definitions, objects, operators, syntax, and all that stuff that would make the non-programmer's eyes glaze over. There are other books that serve that purpose.<br />Open the book and go to the table of contents, find what you need, and start adding it to your Web pages. Screenshots and lines of code are on every page of the book with step-by-step guidelines of how to use and implement the script. You don't even have to type the code from scratch. Instead, go to the book's companion Web site to get the code and fix it up to meet your needs - a great time saver.<br />If you own an earlier edition of the book, this one has 100 more pages of new material including new chapters on 7 - Forms and Regular Expressions, 11 - CSS, 13 - User Interface Design with JavaScript, 14 - Applied JavaScript, and 15 - Bookmarklets. Furthermore, the scripts in the older editions have been revised to ensure compliance with current Web standards.<br />Chapter 7 - Forms and Regular Expressions show how to validate email addresses, file names, and URLs. It gives you a gentle introduction to regexes (regular expressions). Don't panic at the thought of them especially with the handy table of expressions and associated characters. Once you try them out, you'll wonder what you ever did without them.<br />Chapter 13 - User Interface Design with JavaScript gives you the opportunity to create pull-down and sliding menus. Chapter 14 - Applied JavaScript has directions for creating a slideshow with captions and generating bar graphs.<br />Colorful additions to the book are the Object Flowchart and Object Table printed in color to show you which objects are compatible with which browsers. The flowchart may be a challenge for beginners, but the table makes up for it by listing the object along with its properties, methods and event handlers.<br />If you're looking to get cooking with JavaScript, look no further than this cookbook with easily modifiable recipes.

We're seeing fancy pages made with XML, Java, PHP, CSS, Javascript, XHTML, and more. No doubt this has left web page designer wannabes feeling left behind and lamenting it's too late to learn how to design web pages.<br />Jennifer Niederst reaffirms that it is not too late. Her previous and best-selling book, Web Design in a Nutshell has helped many including me take their web design skills to the next level plus it's excellent as a reference book. However, her students were clamoring for a book that is more basic and introductory than the Nutshell. She calls Learning Web Design: A Beginner's Guide to HTML, Graphics and Beyond her \\"prequel\\" and correctly so.<br />This is the book I wish I had when I first learned HTML. Even someone, who has known HTML and understands graphics, this book is still useful. Beginners learn about GIF, JPG and when to use which format. Intermediates are reminded the difference between adaptive, selective, and perceptual color palettes.<br />Niederst includes steps and screen shots for performing different activities in the more popular web design, animation, and graphic software products. I experience an annoyance in my early days of web design - the halo effect on graphics in which I added transparency. Again, this book saves time in trial and error of correcting problems by providing the workarounds and tips.<br />Of course, the nuts and bolts of creating Web pages are covered, but the book doesn't stop there. The last section shows you how to bring it all together and create pages similar to the professional ones out there using HTML and graphics. Finally, learn the secrets of making rounded edges on boxes, 1-pixel square graphics, non-repeating background tiles, and pop-up windows.<br />Every designer has to deal with browser bugs and the tips will help you work through the buggers. Another bonus is the chapter on Building Usable Web Sites, an often-neglected step in many web sites. Here, you're introduced to key principles for designing the user experience and ensuring you have a navigable web site.<br />It's impossible to cover everything Web design in one book. However, if you come across a web page and wonder \\"How did they do that?\\" then go to the last chapter with the same name and find your answers.<br />Stop telling yourself it's too late and get started with this resource. Intermediate designers use this one as a reference and memory jolter of how to do specific web design tasks.n often-neglected step in many web sites.

The book is a showcase of contemporary art created by international graphic designers, animators, artists, and production companies.<br />The art attempts to convey the artist's message emotionally while reaching out to its viewer in the hopes of bonding. The entire book is pure eye candy in every free hand drawing, pixel, vector graphic, 3-D objects, and an encyclopedia of resurfacing motifs. Even non-Internet surfers will recognize many of the colorful and creative designs because they are found other media including television, books, and video games.<br />The index lists all the titles of the art, contributors' names along with their email and Web addresses. As a confessed non-artist, I'm amazed as I flip through pages of expressive and colorfully rendered art. The book can be much more than just another art book, it can be an inspiration for those in the process of creating. This is the coffee table book for geeks and Web designers and it'll go just fine with the books containing the Monets, Picassos, and Renoirs.<br />The book has a companion Web site and you can view pages at the publisher's Web site.	2002-11-06

Think of the best music video mixed with superb art and that's what you get from the DVD.<br />Even if you're unfamiliar with artistic styles, you'll recognize many of the presentations because they're found in today's media: television, movies, online, art, and music. The influences come from the Beatles, Bubbleheads (think PowerPuff Girls and Super Mario Bros. video game), Japanese manga and anime (comics style like Sailor Moon), and artists like Dali and Mondrian. To experts, these are comprised of grunge, Gothic, transformer robot, duotone, geometrical, and pixelated styles.<br />The DVD has a collection of vector presentations, interactive art, linear storytelling sequences, and motion graphics, and movie clips. The Quick Check Reference card lists all of the projects and their codes to make it easier to find and view on the DVD.<br />The pages in the book indicate the creator and the title of the artwork, but it would've been nice if it also included the influence or style with a description to educate readers new to these styles. There are also a handful of interviews with the designers.<br />The back of the book lists all the contributors, the location of the work (page numbers for the book and chapter numbers for the DVD), contact and Web site information, designer's location, project description, development platform and software information, and other tidbits. Joshua Davis of Praystation, DesignerShock, and WDDG are some of the talents whose works appear in the compilation.<br />Admittedly, I don't have an artistic eye and could not begin to properly describe the kind of works found in anime.

Web-based application testing is different from the traditional client / server, PC, and / or mainframe system software products. Also factored in are code quality, browser compatibility, site navigation, user interaction, performance, and scalability.<br />Recognizing that companies need to conduct evaluation as they develop their &quot;next generation&quot; web sites and applications, The authors have written an insightful introduction to the concepts and techniques for conducting various tests. The book starts with an introduction to web programming, servers, architecture, and all those something 2 something terms (Business to Business (B2B) and Market to Market (M2M) for example). To select and conduct appropriate tests requires an understanding the purpose of the application and the architecture that supports it.<br />The authors reference a study by Creative Good during the 1998 holiday season on 10 leading Web shopping sites. The study found that for every US$1 spent on advertising generated US$5 in additional review while US$1 spent on &quot;customer experience&quot; improvements yielded more than US$60 in additional review. What more motivation is needed to ensure your Web site is usable?<br />This handbook guides you through the web testing process. The book is easy to follow and avoids dry &quot;theory&quot; talk that you find in many technical books. How often have you read such a book and found yourself unable to apply it to real world situations? You'll find a handy checklist of test conditions along with URLs for further references associated with the section to help you apply the test concepts. You can take the relevant items from the checklists and create your test case templates. The authors took another step and created a companion Web site using an imaginary company as a case study and included downloadable sample business requirements and test plans associated with the case study.<br />Covering all of the possible bases, the book offers guidelines and checklists for conducting all kinds of testing that applies to web-based applications, from interface usability to server functionality. It also includes common software development scenarios and provides possible options for handling them. For example, a team may require everyone to work on the weekend to test the Web site's ability to handle a large number of users. However, it may not be the best way to go functionally and financially. The authors explain the reasoning and present available options.<br />While traditional software developers are probably most familiar with concepts like load testing (determining how much load a server can handle) and software testing (making sure that all of the functionality works), human factors professionals have touted the concept of usability testing as a way of determining how well a user might be able to navigate and use a web site or application. Jakob Nielsen has been one of the most vocal in this. The book provides a variety of methods for testing usability.<br />The book provides something for everyone in a software development shop including developers, testers, managers, and project managers. Testers get help on how and where to begin. Managers can benefit from the test strategies and planning. Companies new to testing and not knowing which tools and resources to use will want to review the book's unbiased discussion and resources of such tools. You won't feel overwhelmed by the resources because it's organized by sections, which helps you focus on current needs.<br />The book is well laid out and it's a fast read.

Such applications work similarly to a powered up word processor and ease the learning curve for getting started. The challenge is figuring out how to use its features for creating CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), frames, layers, timelines, tables, image maps, positioning elements and clean up tools.<br />When first learning Dreamweaver, I dove into the text, behaviors and tables management aspects of it. It wasn't until much later that I discovered the power of using its image maps and style sheet capabilities. Those needing support with HTML won't find it in this book since its focus, as it should be, is solely on using the Dreamweaver application to design HTML pages, create and manage templates, manage the site's structure, and create pages that work on all browsers and platforms.<br />One of the hottest things today is creating Web pages with XHTML markup accompanied by CSS. There are several pages dedicated to tweaking Dreamweaver to produce correct XHTML markup and an entire chapter devoted to using its CSS features. The book briefly touches on the importing and exporting of XML content, also gaining attention.<br />The authors can't control what Dreamweaver can or cannot do, but they show you how to use it to work around browser issues such as linking to external style sheets with @import as opposed to using link or using both where one satisfies older, lesser compliant browsers and the other for the newer browsers.<br />Surprisingly, there is little reference to making Dreamweaver pages accessible except for a downloadable extension that validates the pages. Though the book is not focused on teaching general Web design, it does add a few tips in utilizing Dreamweaver to create accessible pages such as Javascript workarounds for people who have it turned off.<br />The timelines and interactive chapters lack concrete examples. At least, there are step by step instructions for completing the process.<br />Dreamweaver befuddles the users working with tables especially when they're nested. Though we should be moving away from complex tables in design, the book walks you through various ways to create and manage tables using layout and standard views accompanied by advice on when to use which.<br />Those already using Dreamweaver can count on the book to push their knowledge and skills beyond its basic features and make the most out of this powerful application.

It wisely covers XHTML, CSS, XML, SVG, SMIL -- all growing in popularity and in importance in the world of Web design. It'll help the artistically-inclined integrate their skills with Web design. It'll help programmatically-inclined integrate their skills with the &quot;design&quot; side of color, shape, and typography. The book speaks to these two distinctive groups and how to merge themselves into the areas where they usually need a helping hand.<br />A reviewer indicated it's nothing new to merge the folks from the print world and the programming world into Web design. However, as technology advances and more people get interested in exploring Web careers, they need updated information.<br />This book is not focused on problem solving, but more on education. It provides a handful of tools for integrating technology. There's much more on this topic, but I believe this book is trying to educate the reader and prepare her for the next steps.

It came recommended and it was on sale. What the hey? I love books and I'm a sucker for 'em.<br />Turns out it's one of the smarter book purchases. Zinsser wrote a travel article that fascinated me, a person who skips the boring travel section in the local newspaper.<br />When I read a book to improve some aspect of my life, I have to refer to it and put it to practice or it'll never stick. Not with this book. While reading through it -- and I read it over a period of a few months -- I remembered and applied the concepts in my writing such as omitting needless words and qualifiers. Good stuff, enjoyable read, and lessons applied.	2002-10-11

Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, and A Wrinkle in Time fans will most likely enjoy these chronicles.<br />It's got parallel worlds, enchantment, and humor. We meet and watch Christopher Chant's life unfold among different worlds. He has a big job on his shoulders -- to keep people from abusing their magic abilities.<br />My husband excitedly told me about the story, something he doesn't do unless he enjoys it. He's a Star Trek, Lord of the Ring, and Star Wars fan. So, fathers or adults who enjoy those will probably get a kick out of these.	2002-09-28

Not so. There are references to SMIL, multimedia, visual design, style sheets, and scripting.<br />Author Molly E. Holzschlag explains, &quot;The best way to read the book will be determined by you!&quot; Each chapter stands alone. It is organized to be a resource for you to pick and choose what you need. Special Edition Using XHTML begins with the basics of what is XHTML and how it came to be. Moving deeper into the book, Holzschlag guides you from creating Web pages with XHTML to adding scripts and style to XHTML documents.<br />Books, especially those of a technical nature, written with a personal touch are easier to read and understand. Here, Holzschlag hits the bullseye.<br />Although the book qualifies as a genuine doorstop with 900 plus pages, you'll find it easy to use. Holzschlag makes sure she covers everything. While reading a section about formatting XHTML, I briefly disagreed with a statement. Less than a page later, she explained why the statement is not entirely true.<br />She is honest in her commentary about HTML and design issues. If you want to know why you should bother moving from HTML to XHTML, she tells you. Or why HTML is still going strong and why XHTML has not killed it. Yep, it's there, too.<br />She provides details on XHTML modularization and DTDs (Document Type Definition). There are plenty of examples, screen shots, and step-by-step instructions to help you. If you're like me and forget a few things about writing code, she is there to gently refreshen your memory. Finding specific topics is not a chore with the book's thorough index as well as its single page of the table of contents next to the cover of the book.<br />This book targets intermediate readers, but readers who are learning HTML will be able to use this book. Holzschlag covers all the basics of file naming conventions, clean coding, and wireless programming to name a few. In other words, she gives you much more than you ask for when you pick up this book. Special Edition Using XHTML is a welcome addition to a budding Web development library.gives you much more than you ask for when you pick up this book.

Country music, horse racing, and the beautiful Texas hill country set the scene of Dekker Malone's Nashville Gold. A surprised Payne McCarty hears country music's hottest singer, Rusti King singing the song he wrote on the radio. Payne and his horse jockey best friend, Skeeter head to Nashville to the offices of Sure-Star Publishing to find out why they stole Payne's song. Before he can get an answer from unprincipled publisher Roger Durwood, Durwood has Payne arrested and thrown into county jail where he spends ten miserable days for assault. Dekker Malone has given the characters distinctive personalities that provide the book with its charm. Those who aren't fans of country music and Texas cowboys should still take a look at the book. Though I'm a Texan, I'm no fan of country music. We city types are constantly trying to prove we're not all \\"cowboys\\" and \\"country,\\" but at least readers can get an inside look at the picturesque Texas country. Finishing the book leaves the reader wanting more of these likeable folks and happy to know that Malone has a sequel called KENTUCKY ROSES. The book receives an old-fashioned Texas yee-haw to Dekker Malone for striking gold with his first book.	2002-08-03

Not all of us folks wear cowboy boots and ten gallon hats. I've read NASHVILLE GOLD and was excited to get KENTUCKY ROSES. It took no time to read both because they were a pleasure and quick reading. I really came to care about the characters without realizing it was Malone's talented writing that did it. Think you're good at predicting endings? Try this one on for size... it's tough to accurately predict it. I didn't get it right and loved that.	2002-08-03

Statistics shows that 15 to 30 percent of the population has a need for accessibility features on Web sites. Happily, people live longer and aging brings seeing and hearing challenges. Furthermore, seniors are responsible for over 25 percent of online purchases, neglecting this group can be costly to the company that abandons them. The number shoots up to 40 percent when including people over the age of 40.<br />CEOs, CIOs, C-level whatevers, managers, designers, programmers, and anyone else who has a hand in a Web site will benefit from the book. Not only does it cover the how, but also the whats and whys by saying, \\"This is why we should do this and this is how to do it.\\" Upper level management benefit from information on the Web accessibility laws, guidelines, reasons for creating accessible sites, and the accessibility organization strategy. If an executive wants to reach far and wide, then she can get that by reading and applying the knowledge found in the book. One unique chapter explains how to structure an organization to handle and support accessibility issues, a rarely addressed topic in the world of Web accessibility. The Internet has opened the gates for businesses to go global and there's information about the laws from countries other than the US.<br />Designers and programmers get the tools and resources for creating, evaluating, and validating pages for accessibility compliance. Useful is a comparison and report card on Web design software explaining how each program meets or fails to meet in producing accessible code and features. The book echoes the latest cry in the world of Web design in encouraging designers to separate content from presentation.<br />Having an accessible Web site doesn't mean boring looking pages with nothing but text. Quite the contrary, the authors encourage creating well-design sites while keeping accessibility in mind.<br />As one who has written articles on Web design, the book offers insight into techniques that I hadn't encountered. With multiple authors, readers are assured they're hearing from the experts on each chapter topic. One notable expert is Bob Regan of Macromedia who discusses the tools and techniques of using Flash MX to make a site accessible. Any site that wants to be successful and reach the greatest number of people will invest in creating an accessible site.

It accurately declares itself a guru-free zone.<br />Glasshaus moves away from the traditional guru lecture of &quot;do this, don't do that&quot; and show-offy reading. Instead, the book offers an easy read with a friendly tone based on the designer's style. Meet the the designers of BBC News, Synfonts, eBay, Economist, evolt.org, and MetaFilter. The designers talk about their own Web site and how they worked to make the site what it is today.<br />The book reinforces the basic Web design rule: \\"Know your audience.\\" I can only hope that the book I write will be half as useful and applicable as this one. It wouldn't surprise me if Glasshaus becomes a familiar name in the Web design world.	2002-06-07

For established companies to get involved in the new technologies, they must either acquire start ups, introduce cooperatives efforts either partnering or investing in internal new departments, or uses corporate venture capital to invest in start ups.<br />Established companies are striving to become dotcorps via networked innovation. Loudon explains how each method works, the advantages and drawbacks, and the many reasons for doing this.<br />The book is well organized, easy to read and follow. Key points are emphasized with questions at the end of each chapter, which provide a guide for companies dealing with innovation with its use of shades of gray and statements of key points. Case studies from Europe and the US provide examples of the different strategies and how they work. It focuses more on problem solving than on the problems offering detailed methods for companies to organize for innovation.<br />While VC (venture capital) was the catch phrase of the late `90s, the authors explores the different types and ways of using VC. What companies did right. What companies did wrong.<br />The index lists all of the companies covered in the book to help the reader immediately find those that interest her. Boo.com's failure is mentioned, of course, as a first mover that did not become a prover. There are examples of everything including partnerships, buy-outs, corporate venture capital, B2C, B2B, and more.<br />While this book is aimed at companies and purports to be a road map to follow in pursuit of innovation and in preparation for what's next on the Internet, it's good reading for individuals interested in business tactics, in plotting change that keeps coming, and in investing in the companies that show the most creativity and openness to deal with the future.<br />Loudon reminds the reader that everything doesn't happen overnight. While the Internet has become the wave of the future, its present is no yet what it was hoped for. Sound business practices, profitability, ability to attract and keep good employees still remain watchwords for success along with creativity and innovation.e the Internet has become the wave of the future, its present is no yet what it was hoped for.

The young daughter is looking to achieve something extraordinary to catch her parents' attention, the son is looking to get closer to God, the mother tries to follow her heart's desire in the collection of objects, and the father is the glue that holds the family together. The daughter finally stands out by winning the spelling bee and working her way to the National Bee in Washington, DC. Of course, the father supports her, but not at first. By the end of the book, we've been put on an unrealistic and highly spiritual journey with no real closure.

This book proved me wrong. It touches upon a little of everything using real-life projects from something simple as creating a personal Web site to a real challenge in using XML for the Wireless Web. Guess what? It's only two hundred something pages. Holzschlag and five other talented Web professionals have done a superb job showing how to do each project step-by-step to resolve the problem as identified at the beginning of each project chapter. Following the problem definition are the needed technical specs and the technologies or skills to complete the project. In general, this book is for those familiar with HTML, a text editor such as Notepad, and web graphics production. For some projects, it recommends a basic understanding of JavaScript and CSS. Wherever you are in your Web design knowledge, you can follow along with the book.
