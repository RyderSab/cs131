Its great and has stuff that the movie didn't. It was the type of book that you couldn't just read a chapter. You had the read on to find out what happened next. It's kinda exciting for someone who has never seen the movie.

It opened my eyes and made me not take my friends for granted. It told about Morgan, a 17 yr. old high school student that looses her best friend, Jimmy. He was in a car accident that involved a drunk driver. He was very outgoing, and a great dancer that would've been a star. She learns how to cope with the death without going crazy (even though she does go crazy a couple times!). She finds comfort within her family, and even makes a new friend. Over all it was a great book and I would recommend it to all ages.	2002-01-08

I feel sorry for those people who actually like to read boring books like this. I can kind of tell if a book is boring if in the first twenty and a half chapters are so boring that I would rather do my chores instead of reading this stupid book. I can't help it , but man the only interesting part in the whole book is the last three chapters, but even at the end of the twenty third chapter it was so boring that I could hardly stay awake to read the end of this stupid book.	2002-01-08

While it is telling a story. The book also goes into detail about everything, it follows a certin order in which the characters go. It is also a great book because it has to do with 4 friends, their isn't many books that just relate to 4 friends.This book also has to do with the world and faith and evil which is something most kids need to read about. The book gives in a odd way a perspective of how 4 friends act when they are with each. Its a very exciting and suspenseful book. I would deffently suggest this book to be read by most people exspecially kids.	2002-01-08

It really told the truth about the things you could go through if you were pregnant.  And if it was not enough money to go around in your family for you and your future child.

In the end  how it came to a big decision that Val had to make on her own.
