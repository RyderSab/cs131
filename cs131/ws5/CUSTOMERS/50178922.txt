There is excellent info in here on a plant's propagation/division and planting requirements. I haven't found anything better.<br />There are problems: 1) I wish it was more exhaustive in the number of plants it covers, although for a primer it picks really good candidates.  2) It commits the common sin of putting the photographs in their own section instead of with the text, substituting nearly useless line drawings next to the text.  3) The book is topically organized -- plants for shade, using ground cover, developing woodland gardens, etc. I find this rather annoying, and I can never find what I want right away.  I'm forever referring to the index.  4) It's presented on cheap paper stock in an amateurish paragraph format, with no page divisions for different plants.  This makes it needlessly difficult to use as a reference.<br />In sum, there is a lot of great info in here, enough to recommend it.  I just wish the layout was better.	2002-12-29

Generally excellent photographs and an accessible page layout, with a description, requirements (soil type, sun), propagation tips, and good companions for each plant. Very pleasant to read.<br />There is one goofy thing about this book that is worth mentioning:  The plants are presented in alphabetical order by common name. This leads to confusion when you find nothing under Trillium, only to find it under &quot;Western Trillium,&quot; or you find Coneflower under &quot;Purple Coneflower.&quot;  The index lists only Latin names.  To get around the problem of multiple common names, the book should be sorted by Latin name, and the common names should be available along with the latin names in the index.	2002-12-29

There are puzzling omissions, such as wintergreen, and this is probably because the book is biting off a lot of territory.<br />The introductory travelogue on the regions of the United States is outstanding.  When it comes to the plants themselves, though, Cullina does this book one better.	2002-12-29

The authors are not shy about their opinions and the book is better for it.  <br />On the down side, the book is not nearly as exhaustive as Cullina's books.  I also don't like that it puts the photographs apart from the text, as this makes for some annoying page-flipping.

Nock defines the state as an anti-social mechanism for executing the \\"political means\\" i.e. taking from one pocket and putting it into another. He traces this back to the founding of our republic and before.  Published in 1935, the book was written at an interesting time when fascism and communism were rising, while FDR was domestically pushing economic fascism and using the political means to the fullest. <br />\\"Our Enemy, the State\\" is witty, often eloquently written, and accessible to the lay reader. Take your time and let it sink in.  Read the footnotes too!  Despite its sad commentary on humanity and the future of our society, one finds the thesis hard to dispute (in Nock's time, the state stole 1/3 of our money; now it steals over half). It's fitting that the introduction is written by a minister.  To paraphrase Chesterton, original sin is the easiest Christian doctrine to prove.<br />One thing you'll see in the book often, without explanation, are complaints against land-tenure.  As I understand it, this is based on the teaching of some classical liberals and libertarians (aka. the \\"land use\\" school) that monopoly land grants by the state are another form of the political means, as they are invariably given to favored constituencies and individuals (many of America's founding fathers received them).  These grants are then exploited by charging some form of rent to the unconnected non-recipients.  \\"Land use\\" proponents argue that the earth is owned in common by all mankind. The \\"owner\\" simply owns improvements to the land such as factories, homes, and income, and there should be community user fees levied on the owner that deny the use of that land to others (These fees are not the same as property taxes that tax improvements and collect revenues for public education.  In fact, all taxes on improvements aka. productivity - income, capital gains, estate, etc  - are considered a formof robbery).	2002-07-25

Having enjoyed the previous book (Means of Ascent) immensely, I was looking forward to this one. However, I was shocked to find a constant (and depressing given Caro's skill) liberal bias that was simply too thick to make it readable.  <br />One brief example is the glorification of Woodrow Wilson in one of the opening chapters -- he &quot;democratized&quot; (!) our financial structure with the income tax, says the author.  And we see liberal opponents portrayed as backward reactionaries with bad motives, with nary a principled opponent to federal power or a constitutional guardian among them.  <br />Caro's moralizing about equality and rights reminds me of of what Bastiat wrote in 1850:  &quot;Socialism... confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education.... We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality.&quot;	2002-07-16

Very fine, with great pictures and identification tables in the back that help you tell the difference between similar varieties of weeds.

Smartweeds, for example, are not shown with their common purple splotch.  \\"Weeds of the Northeast\\" is far better for identification, especially when you are dealing with seedlings. b) Some common weeds like garlic mustard and yellow foxtail are not included.  Maybe it's time for a revision, since the copyright reads 1987.<br />Once I ID a weed, though, it's always fun to pull out this book and read what they have to say about it. For this reason - and its reasonable cost - I recommmend it.	2002-07-03

This book focuses mainly on Jackson's finely honed (and rather clever) extortion techniques. For years I always thought JJ an egotist who was using racial causes to advance himself, but the book leaves one with an overwhelming sense of what a greedy scoundrel the \\"reverend\\" really is.  The same goes for his equally slimy business buddies (names are named) who have both profited from him and provided kickbacks to his organization.<br />This is the first I've seen anyone explain exactly how JJ, a seminary dropout, acquired the title of \\"reverend.\\"  It shows his sickening support of African thugs who committed the worst atrocities imaginable against their own countrymen.  It shows his (and MLKs) ties to a Stalinist who in turn influenced his leftist internalionalist leanings of the late 70s onward.  It shows how Clinton's ascendancy was a key boon to his shakedowns.  <br />Shakedown is occasionally a bit dry due to all the details, but all in all it's a powerful accusation against a colossal hypocrite.	2002-04-29

It's functional and somewhat intuitive. It handles system resources sloppily - get more than 4-5 windows open you'll be getting messages about low system resources (fwiw, my machine is has 256M RAM and 30G free space). Problem is alleviated but not fixed in version 3.1. Note to Biblesoft: This is an inexcusable handling of resources.<br />That said, as a program I've found it useful, especially for studying specific verses or chapters. It's much easier to search these dictionaries than hardcover ones; ditto for word studies and commentaries. You pull up a verse, and dictionary, commentary, and other cross-referencing is a click away. The supplied Matthew Henry commentary is superb, a &quot;must have&quot; no matter what program you get. The Barnes' Notes are mostly excellent too. These two commentaries make a good team. Now if they'd just get all the Banner of Truth commentaries in there, we'd be in commentary heaven.	2002-01-12

The descriptions are useful but brief, and I really like that it &quot;rates&quot; the objects based on brightness and overall impact.  It also lists what it considers to be the showpieces in each constellation.  This really helps you to summarize what you are going to look at that evening.  I do my homework in this book before going out.  I love the linear map on the inside cover, too.  For many objects, it describes views you'll see in scopes from a backyard 6&quot; reflector to a 20&quot; (and beyond) dob.

He clearly despises Stalin, but how could one  look upon his unfathomable devastation otherwise?  As someone who has  studied Soviet history for years, I can tell you that Conquest's writings  are right in line with nearly all books on the topic of Stalin, even those  by Marxists like Medvedev (not to mention the great Solzhenitsyn himself).   <br />This is a good intro to the topic of Stalinist terror.  To a novice  reader, it will be a bit hard to keep all of the names straight, but it  will also be a real eye-opener -- you'll see where Orwell mined many of his  ideas.  I'd strongly recommend that all readers of this gravitate to  Kravchenko's I Chose Freedom (cliched title, I know, but a great  autobiography).	2000-08-17

Like the previous reviewer, I too strongly prefer the  paragraph format and the New King James Version as the best translation out  there (fwiw, it was done by translators who believed in the inerrancy of  Scripture).  The books are opened with a good discussion of background and  context.  Most comments are brief but illuminating, and there is the  occasional one-page forays into more substantive issues (e.g. Angels, The  Sacraments, Christian Liberty).

The novel  lost me later on when it explained  too much about Belbury, and then simultaneously confused me with the (far)  less interesting goings on at St. Anne's.

But it's emotional enough, and it's occasionally very funny too.   Especially valuable is the inside information on Reagan's unsuccessful  1976 run.  Like Rollins, Nofziger believes that Reagan's executive style of  management (i.e. knowing his place) was a great strength, but his  remoteness and inattention to detail also led to the appointment of the  people (Baker in particular) who undermined his conservative philosophy and  shunted his key advisers (e.g. Meese). This directly led to the ineffective  second term and the Bush years. Thus the &quot;revolution&quot; was largely  DOA. Nofziger is one of the good guys in politics. Honest and not  self-aggrandizing. If only there were more of him in Washington. He  maintains a site out at lynnofziger.com.	2000-07-02

Expand the book by 20-30 pages or remove some of  the stuff you see everywhere else, and you have it. Why leave out all sorts  of interesting areas of the sky?	2000-01-26

If you don't own any astronomy books and want a good primer, this is ok.  Before you buy it, you may want to just check it out from the library and see what you think.  Fairly expensive for what you get.  I didn't see it as a ready reference.   I'd recommend the spiral bound version of Nightwatch for beginners instead.	2000-01-26

Just the right amount of commentary and detail for intermediate observational astronomy. The maps are also very good.  Here's the problem: Only 1/2 of the sky is  covered in the starhopping section!  Why go halfway? A good number of  interesting regions aren't covered at all. Instead, they clutter up the  first 2/3 of the book with the usual info about types of telescope, stars,  pictures of planets, etc. We've read and seen this before. Any library book  tells you the same stuff.  Use the pages to cover ALL regions of the sky.   It's really a shame.<br />Another problem is the hardcover format, which makes  the book difficult for field use.  It's thin and tall, which doesn't help  it to stay open. A spiral bound version would be better.	2000-01-26
