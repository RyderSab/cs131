The book starts from his childhood and progresses all the way through to his bailout of Salomon Brothers in the early 90's. The book receives no input from Buffett himself, so all the details are carefully crafted through hours of research and interviews with friends and families. <br /> <br />What emerges is a remarkably detailed and incredibly entertaining look at the life of Buffett. Lowenstein carefully weaves personal stories with investment philosophy to construct a complete picture of Buffett as both a man and as one of the greatest investors of our time. Buffett is portrayed as a man with incredible insight and great strength of character yet he is still afflicted with many of the foibles that besiege mere mortals such as ourselves. <br /> <br />I think the quintessential Buffett image is captured in his negotiation over the price of a warrant. On the opposing side, there is the investment bank, their team of quants, their lawyers and their computers crunching the numbers away. On the other side is Buffett, with no aides and no computers. Just Buffett doing the sums in his head. Classic. <br /> <br />An incredibly well crafted book and I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone.	2005-04-10

The main reason why I say this is that after reading the book, the reader's grasp of correct pre-flop play will be tenuous at best. Firstly, Jones talks about early, middle and late positions without ever defining the terms. There are no guidelines at all for when early becomes middle or when middle becomes late. <br /> <br />Secondly and more importantly, starting hand guidelines are given without any regard for how many players are at the table. For example, in late positions Jones recommends calling 75 suited with \\"Four or fewer callers in front\\". Therefore, according to the guidelines there is no difference whether you have zero players in front or whether you have four players in front. This is an egregious error on Jones' part. The idea of playing a hand like 75s is, you want to see the flop cheaply, with many people in the pot and you hope to flop an absolute monster and rake a large pot. If there are no callers in front, there's very little point calling a bet to be contesting a small pot with few people in the hand. This is only one of a number of errors that I only discovered through the painful process of losing session after session. <br /> <br />There are also flaws in his advice on post flop play. For example, he says \\"if you never folded after flopping a set, you probably wouldn't be making much of a mistake\\". Again this is incorrect. If the flop shows two hearts, the turn brings another heart and you are check raised when you bet your trips (three of a kind) you can be pretty sure that the check raiser is holding a flush. In this situation, folding is usually the correct thing to do. <br /> <br />Although 80% of the advice in the book is highly accurate, the other 20% will open up huge holes in your game that will make it almost impossible to become a winning player.	2004-12-04

Elder provides a complete trading manual, covering topics such as entry/exit points, trading psychology, money management, capital requirements and so forth. The methods he uses are not overly complicated yet still very powerful when properly implemented. He's well aware that the efficient market hypothesis invalidates technical trading, yet he provides a convincing argument as to why the academics have in this case got it wrong. Elder's style is easy to read and he combines his trading insights with a wry sense of humour. Most importantly, it is abundantly clear that Elder is a trader himself and many of his assertions are backed by years of experience. Overall I would highly recommend this text for those involved in technical trading.	2004-11-11

The \\"Body Farm\\", where he performed experiements on decaying corpses, features prominently in the book. The thing that struck me about this book was the resemblance between a forensic investigation and a Sherlock Holmes mystery. Aside from using the tools of forensic science, the author often had to use powers of deduction to determine plausible explanations for bizarre scenarios. For example, if a victim had allegedly crashed his car and been incinerated in the resulting inferno, why did the evidence point to his head being upside down on the floor while the fire raged around him? <br /> <br />The book contains some very interesting material, even for someone like myself with no particular interest in forensic science. The language of the book is easy to read and the author avoids using technical jargon in order to not intimidate the reader. The book itself is well written and engaging. Each of the twenty chapters is a short story and this structure works very well. <br /> <br />Although the topic itself is inherently disturbing and at times chilling, the author avoids sensationalising the topics and describes his subject matter in a matter-of-fact way. His sense of humour comes through and he manages to integrate it into the novel without trivialising or demeaning his subjects. Thoroughly enjoyable read and highly recommended.	2004-10-11

I'm disappointed to report that the book has not lived up to my expectations. Many of the specific concepts of the book are outdated. The author refers to practices such as price manipulation, which these days is illegal. A large section of the book refers to strategies for unloading large volumes of stocks. These methods are rather crude and these days there are many sophisticated programs available for optimising the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) on a large bundle of stock. <br /> <br />Perhaps some would argue that trading principles are always the same and that this text is a great reference for basic trading principles. Again I beg to differ. The subject of the book was basically a \\"tape reader\\". He speculated on which way price would move based purely on past price movements. These days he would be known as a technical trader. One incident that stands out in particular is the time that he lost his entire capital and furthermore was in debt to brokers and friends for over one million dollars. The author proudly describes how, starting with a reasonably small stake of some tens of thousands, he was rapidly able to accumulate enough wealth to pay all his debt and keep a handsome profit for himself. To me, this sounds suspiciously like gambling and I am sceptical of any trader who can claim to turn tens of thousands into millions with little risk in a short period of time. <br /> <br />So are there any lessons to be gained from this book? Well to me the primary lesson was that there is nothing new on the stockmarket. All the unusual phenomena that we have witnessed in recent years were also witnessed by the author in his time. Hardly a profound insight and definitely not worth trawling through the pedestrian prose and at times difficult to read text. As a final note Jesse Livermore committed suicide in 1940 leaving $10,000 in his will (Source: Wheels of Fortune - The History of Speculation from Scandal to Respectability). I believe this provides further evidence that the subject of the book was a lucky gambler rather than a skilled trader. Save your time on this one there are plenty of better books out there. <br /> <br />	2004-10-09

It is written in a cynical tone, with plenty of self-deprecating quips such as \\"It [end of year bonus] was more than I had contributed to society; Christ, if social contribution had been the measure, I should have been billed rather than paid at the end of the year.\\" <br /> <br />The book portrays Wall Street as a testsoterone driven money making factory. It is OK to gouge the clients as long as it makes money for the firm. In fact, such activities are actively encouraged. The bottom line is always the bottom line. It matters not if you have to crawl over the corpse of your best friend to stab your colleague in the back. If, at the end of the year you made a lot of money for the firm then you were in line for a fat bonus and a round of back slapping from the \\"Big Swinging Dicks\\". Wall Street is a fine example of Darwinian forces at work. It is a near pure meritocracy where the strong survive and the weak are swallowed whole. <br /> <br />I found the book highly entertaining. The author is not a professional writer, and this shows in certain sections of the book where the prose is unpolished. Nonetheless, a highly entertaining sojourn into Salomon Brothers and if you have even a passing interest in finance or investment banking, I recommend this as a good read.	2004-09-25

The book is lacking in technical details and is not recommended as a handbook for how to arbitrage Nikkei futures. Of the several hundred pages in the text, only a small handful are dedicated to the mechanics of arbitrage and trading. The description of trading is very generic and does not provide any insights to anyone with even a passing knowledge of finance. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, like his last book, this one was entertaining. He could have fleshed out his main characters with a little more relish, so that the reader could feel more empathy with their stories. Overall, an entertaining narrative if approached as such. If you are hoping to learn the intricacies of trading, then expect to be disappointed.	2004-09-21

Two incidents in particular strike me as clear examples of why Richard Branson is an unfit leader for the group. <br /> <br />The first was his decision to stake the entire future of the Virgin Group on the success of the airline company. It is universally acknowledged that the introduction of the airline business posed an enormous risk to the company as a whole. Whilst I can understand one man's desire to gamble his stake on a high risk venture, what is unacceptable to me is the incredible willigness with which Branson is willing to risk not only his own stake, but that of his friends and life long business partners who also had a share of the group. <br /> <br />The second incident that appals me is the willigness with which Branson risks his life despite the presence of a family who rely on his support. I suspect his intent was to garner gasps of admiration from the audience for his apparent bravado, however I can only wholeheartedly express my disgust. I can certainly understand why a single man would engage in such a thrill seeking adventure. However, to gamble not only your own future but that of your family is an act of a man whos ego dwarfs the size of his balloon. <br /> <br />The book makes it difficult to judge his skills as a businessman, however as a person Mr Branson exemplifies the \\"me first\\" philosophy which unfortunately has become so common in modern life. Despite my criticisms of Branson as a person the book itself is an enjoyable read and contains many moments that I am confident the reader will enjoy.	2004-09-14

The book provides an outline of all the key players and their contribution to risk theory and management. Chronologically, the book begins in ancient times and stretches all the way to the present, where Bernstein delves into the works of modern day risk luminaries. The book is well written and the style is engaging, with the author always managing to find a way to keep the reader entertained as well as informed.<br />The book does not pretend to be a \\"how to\\" guide for risk management, nor should readers treat it as such. Although the book does discuss modern risk management tools such as derivatives, it is devoid of complex technical analysis and its treatment of such devices is limited to outlining their place in the history of risk. Those looking for technical trading analysis should seek elsewhere.<br />One of the key questions a potential reader of this book should be asking is \\"Does this book have any practical applications with regards to modern day risk management?\\" Whilst as mentioned above the book is not a step by step guide, I firmly believe the book is useful insofar as it enables the reader to avoid the pitfalls of the past. For example, capital markets are continually surprising those who hold an unwavering belief in \\"regression to the mean\\". The books provides an explanation of what this theory states, how it has been applied and where overzealous disciples have misused this principle in the past. Overall I would recommend this book as an informative and enjoyable read.	2004-03-08

It is supposed to provide the reader with an education, equipped with which he or she can finally beat the bookmaker. In a word it is horrible. The book is poorly written and it was a real struggle to force myself through the text. The chapters are littered with bad attempts at poetry. <br />Although there may be one or two useful points, they are buried under a massive proliferation of obvious statements, paragraphs that lead nowhere and gushings of &quot;Bob's Law&quot;, an example of which reads &quot;Just when you're getting ready to call your bookie, someone always calls you&quot;. <br />The book is ring bound and the presentation is very shabby. Although there are few things that are blatantly incorrect, I cannot find any redeeming attributes which would lead me to recommend this book.	2004-02-21

The book takes a very methodical approach to beating the number posted by the bookmaker. The book outlines a number of interesting techniques for beating various spread, moneyline and proposition wagers.<br />The author expects the reader to blindly accept many of his techniques. Large sections of the book assume that sports data fits neatly into a particular probability distribution, such as Poisson or binomial. The author does not justify his reasoning and expects the reader to go on faith alone. This left me slightly uneasy because if the underlying assumption is incorrect, all the calculations are rendered useless.<br />Perhaps the biggest drawback of the book is its age. Many of the techniques have already been incorporated into the betting line. No bookmaker will allow the player to have an advantage by buying off the \\"3\\" in the NFL.  The book is still useful for evaluating certain wagers such as middles but unfortunately its value has greatly diminished with time.<br />A good book to buy for easy access to NFL reference charts.	2004-01-17

It must be noted that such an enterprise is illegal and carries various risk.  The book constantly mentions large tax free income which adds tax evasion to your list of criminal activities.<br />My biggest gripe with the book is its deviation from factual and useful content.  The &quot;basics&quot; chapter is riddled with glaring deficiencies - here are a few that I noted<br />(a) Book: there are no winning gamblers - truth: there are few winning gamblers, but the few winners can really hurt the bottom line<BR>(b) Book: you cannot specify pitchers in baseball - truth: the standard way to book baseball is to offer listed pitchers<BR>(c) Book: Dime line baseball is booked at -110 a side - truth: dime line baseball is booked at -105 a side<BR>(d) Book: Soccer is booked without totals - truth: soccer is booked with totals, 2.5 being the most common number<BR>(e) Book: Nascar is an easy money spinner - truth: Nascar is a sport where the lines are weak and the &quot;wiseguys&quot; can eat you alive<BR>(f) Book: The &quot;field&quot; bet never wins in golf - truth: &quot;No name&quot; golfers are beginning to proliferate the winner's list at PGA and European golf tournaments<br />Aside from the factual inaccuracies, the book simply doesn't mention many of the important developments that have taken place in the bookmaking world. Important terms such as &quot;beard&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;steam&quot; are only mentioned in the glossary. Each term quite possibly deserves a chapter of its own. Finally, there is no mention of the ubiquitous &quot;Don Best&quot; screen, which governs the betting line from Vegas to the Caribbean. The way the author describes grading the wagers manually is almost comical.<br />The lack of professional writing skill is evident and the only thing that kept me reading to the end was the author's quirky sense of humour. My favourite line in the book is whenhe casually mentions &quot;If you are going to be hiring someone to work with you in this business, you must...accept that at some time, he will probably steal from you&quot;. Although the author has a number of character flaws, this nonchalant attitude is something we could all use at times.<br />In summary I really cannot recommend this book to gamblers and especially not to anyone thinking of becoming a bookmaker!	2004-01-10

The main strength of the book is its entertainment value. I read the book from cover to cover in a single session.  Although the writing is at times pedestrian the author certainly knows how to keep his audience captivated. Much of the book reads like a spy novel with subterfuge, violence, glamour and money.<br />The main drawback of the book is its deviation from factual content. The author makes it seem as if losing is a rare occurrence whereas in blackjack it occurs very regularly. Playing blackjack is glamourised, with the author describing high stakes gambling with famous celebrities.  The reality is professional blackjack is not very glamorous and involves grinding at the tables for countless hours in less than salubrious conditions.<br />If you are seeking some light entertainment the book is highly recommended however for a more realistic view of professional blackjack I would look elsewhere.	2004-01-09

The traits that are necessary are much the same as in any other profession.  You need skill, hard work, persistence, a healthy appetite for risk and of course a little bit of luck.<br />Slightly alarming is the frequency with which the protagonists of the book go from being broke to being a millionaire and then back again. Although trivialised in the book, when a professional gambler goes broke it often represents damage that is irreversible. Nevertheless, each person in the book has character attributes worthy of emulation.<br />A good read for historians of the game and those who wonder what it is like to be a professional gambler.	2004-01-09

The style of prose is easy to read and the book avoids technical jargon. <br />A distinction is made between covert (or hidden) depression and overt depression - the type which is plain for the world to see. Covert depression in many cases is hidden from the victim himself. The author suggests a strong link between covert depression and addictive behavior.<br />Although the book was very educational, it left me with an overwhelming feeling of sadness. Case after case after case of abuse, violence, despair and hate leaves the reader with a profound sorrow and a feeling that the world is a terrible place. <br />Male depression is a \\"legacy\\" in the sense that it can be passed down through the generations. In many cases, a father is not able to come to grips with his own psychological afflictions and in turn these manifest themselves in the child when he grows up to be a man.<br />Male depression can also spring from cultural expectations. Men try to conform to the stereotype of \\"strong, silent\\". If a man is an alcoholic or addicted gambler, these are conditions that are seen as curable. However, if a man chooses to discuss his emotions or behaves in a manner which might be considered as feminine, then he is avoided like a leper and socially ostracized. <br />The book concludes with a powerful message - that it is necessary in life to nurture relationships and have a goal in life that is larger than personal gratification. This is a personal quest on which I am currently embarking.<br />I have no negative things to say about the book and would highly recommend its purchase!	2003-07-31

The rest of the book however, is terrific. <br />Shepard touches on a number of topics where people might have certain \\"hang ups\\" or misconceptions about themselves. Examples include: secrets, rejection, sex, parents, alone and people with people and work.<br />Each topic is thoroughly covered by an easy to read chapter. The book does not use technical language and is targeted at the layman. Each chapter finishes with a number of provocative exercises. For example, the chapter entitled \\"Secrets\\" concludes with:<br />1. Think of the thoughts you are ashamed of right now. Write them down.<br />and question 4 asks the reader to tell a stranger these things.<br />The overall message of the book is about achieving balance in life. Although not explicitly stated, the underlying theme that Shepard preaches revolves around moderation in all things. There is no need to become distraught because one considers oneself \\"abnormal\\". More likely than not, this perceived abnormality is simply a figment of the imagination. For example, Shepard states that it is simply a fact that most men orgasm within 10 seconds to 3 minutes and most women do not orgasm at all.<br />Overall a great book for anyone suffering from the feeling that there is something \\"wrong\\" with them.	2003-07-02

I was drawn to this book by the interesting title. Unfortunately, the text left me rather unfulfilled. Nader is a self proclaimed &quot;Post Tentative Virtual Surrealist&quot;. This is a rather pompous and meaningless title that is never explained.<br />The book is full of vague concepts that requirement further elaboration. Nader talk about logicitivity and loosely describes it as a combination of logic and creativity. No practical guidelines are given has to how to develop this skill. He seems to spend a lot of time arguing semantics. He spends a chapter talking about the difference between a &quot;leader&quot; and &quot;leadership&quot;. By the end of the chapter, he hasn't really made any valid contribution or furthered his argument in any way. He states that &quot;Supreme leadership must do what is necessary to remove these barriers for the benefit of those who are unable to fend for themselve&quot;. This sounds like a definition of a good Samaritan rather than a good leader.<br />Another chapter is spent discussing &quot;attitude&quot; and &quot;atmosphere&quot;. Once again his discussion trails into nothing. Some of his points are factually incorrect. He states that the statistic of &quot;50 per cent&quot; is &quot;meaningless because it only applies to situtations that can be simulated at least ten times&quot;. This is incorrect project success can be estimated using historical data. Bookmakers must do this all the time when estimating the probability for events that will only ever occur once.<br />There were some aspects of the book that I liked. He had a &quot;rule of halves&quot;, whereby you make an effort to halve the time you spend on trivial and frivolous tasks. He also takes a realistic approach to business, stating that the goal is profit and not customer service. Customer service is simply a means to profit and is not the prime objective. <br />All in all I think the book is a thorough waste of time. There are a few gems but it's really not worth the effort of pouring through this whole tome in order to separate the wheat from the chaff. My recommendation is to avoid it completely the only person it will infuriate is the reader!	2003-01-26

It extracts the main principles of &quot;The Prince&quot; and divides them into the &quot;Principles of Power&quot;. The book itself has very little resemblance to &quot;The Prince&quot; and I'm very impressed by Demack's insightful analysis of the original text. Some of the tenets of the book are controversial, but upon reflection they do make sense for someone seeking to acquire power.<br />The book has some very powerful lessons to offer and I believe it is applicable to many areas of life.

A word that is now synonymous with deception and deceit, I felt compelled to visit the source and see for myself what Niccolo Machiavelli had to say. Unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that \\"The Prince\\" is merely a convoluted text with little modern day relevance. <br />Basically, the book is a \\"how to\\" guide for being an Italiance prince in the 16th century. Most of the book is quite specific to his set of circumstances. For example he discusses the difference between inheriting a country and acquiring a country by prowess. He talks about the difference between conquering a land with a single ruler as opposed to conquering a land with many rulers. Some statements are blindingly obvious \\"When you see a minister thinking more of himself than of you, and seeking his own profit in everything he does, such a one will never be a good minister.\\"<br />The text is heavily laced with anecdotes to back up his points. These tales are not really generalisable to modern day times, for example \\"We have in Italy, the duke of Ferrara; he withstood the assaults of the Venetians in '84 and those of Pop Julius in 1510, for no other reason than his power had been established a long time\\".<br />The book does contain some pearls of advice - \\"A prudent ruler cannot, and should not, honour his word when it places him at a disadvantage and when the reasons for which he made his promise no longer exist\\". Machiavelli seems to have been a very pragmatic character and if he were alive today, I suspect he would be the embodiment of anti-poltical correctness.<br />Overall I found the book a very dry read. Try as I might, I found it difficult to extract much that was of modern day relevance. Note that I have read and reviewed the book as a person with little knowledge of Italian history, political science, or other related topics that may help in comprehending this text.	2003-01-21

However he talks a lot about going through a &quot;detox&quot; which involves eating only fruit. I find this questionable and I don't believe it is backed up by any logic or research.<br />The section on meditation is good reading especially if you haven't done any sort of meditation before. It offers some very practical advice that will help you get through the hectic pace of modern day lifestyle.<br />As a yoga book I was very happy with my purchase. Almost all of the information is very valuable, and aside from a few minor points in the nutrition section this book is thoroughly and wholeheartedly recommended for anyone interested in vigorous yoga.	2003-01-15

The book in a sense is a historical record of chaos from its beginnings through to the late 1980s. Chaos manifests itself in all areas of life from a dripping faucet to the beating of the heart to the spread of various epidemics. Gleick explores all different facets of chaos in a delightful manner. The main players take on a life of their own and the book is written in an interesting and captivating style. <br />Speaking from a layman's perspective, some of the content is difficult to grasp. At times I felt the material required technical knowledge which I simply did not possess. However, many of the concepts are wonderfully illustrated including a collection of colour photographs depicting various chaotic phenomena including the famous Mandelbrot set. <br />All in all a very interesting, educational read for anyone who enjoys science writing.	2003-01-10

It covers quite a broad range of topics from individual decision making to group decisions. Both qualitative and quantitative perspectives are considered. Good decisions do not necessarily result in good outcomes. Instead the decision maker is responsible for making the best decision possible with the information on hand at the time. This usually results from an assessment of the projected consequences and the probability of various outcomes.<br />I like the book because it is easy to read and the author laces the text with some very humorous cynicism. The book covers a diverse number of topics from dating, to gambling, to investing to war. Unfortunately the book is most definitely targeted at the American market. The book includes discussion on American law, the Constitution and American sports. Occasionally I found my eyes glazing over because I couldn't find any broad relevance in the material. This only occurred a small percentage of the time much of the book is very generalisable to anyone faced with making a decision.<br />Overall the book was a highly enjoyable read. Thoroughly recommended if you would like to improve your decision making or would just like a good intellectual exploration of the process of making sound decisions.	2003-01-01

The book is largely an account of the author's lessons as a social worker. The premise of the book is that many seemingful helpful actions are motivated by a person's ego.<br />The book provides many piercing insights into human nature. The author argues that many people engage in the act of giving in order to feel a sense of righteousness, in order to indulge in the belief that they are somehow improving the situation of others. The author states that this judgement of &quot;I am right, you are wrong&quot; is fuelled by ego and is sometimes harmful to the other party. The book also discusses other important philosophies, such as the ability to relish the present, rather than whittling time away waiting for the next &quot;big event&quot; to happen in life.<br />Although the content is powerful and provocative, I found the book difficult to read. The author's style is rigid and quite unengaging. The chapters seem logically disconnected and at times the text was difficult to follow. Nevertheless, I think the book contains many powerful messages and is certainly recommended for anyone who believes that they are an altruistic individual.	2002-12-25

The book provides a set of very simple principles that you can apply to your life to stop worrying.<br />The book is well written and very easy to read. The chapters are short and therefore easy to absorb. The lessons are not profound. Rather, the book reminds us of simple things that we may have forgotten. It chides us for worrying about trivial things, for worrying about things that we cannot change and for worrying about things that may never pass.<br />The book may seem slightly dated nevertheless its basic tenets are sound. The one thing I did not like about the book was its overuse of stories and anecdotes. The book would make a point and then use quite a number of stories to support the point. I think this was excessive. One or two supporting anecdotes would have been sufficient.<br />Overall this book has made a change to the way that I view the world. If we all stepped back and objectively analysed our current lives, most of us would realise how fortunate we are to enjoy the privileges that we do today. Strongly recommended for anyone currently living the modern day, hectic, stress filled lifestyle.	2002-12-18

Royce Gracie's incredible performances in the first four Ultimate Fighting Championships showed just how important ground fighting was to \\"real world\\" combat situations.<br />There are a number of things that I like about this book. The first half of the book is titled \\"Theory\\" and provides a great introduction to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It provides a good background information as well as dispelling myths such as \\"You can take on two or more skilled attackers at the same time\\". The next section is \\"Technique\\". The photos are large, clear and in colour. The text is also clear and easy to understand.<br />The book suffers from lack of organisation and limited techniques. The techniques do not appear to be laid out in a well thought out manner. The book is laid out according to belt levels. However the distinction between techniques seems rather arbitrary. For example the \\"kimura\\" lock is not shown until purple belt even though this is quite a fundamental technique. Brazilian jiu jitsu and striking techniques are interwoven in no logical manner.<br />Some fundamental techniques are also missing from the book. For example, only two guard passes are covered. To those are unfamiliar with BJJ, guard passing is one of the most important aspects. If you cannot pass the guard, then you cannot attain superior positioning from which to apply submissions. All techniques a done with a gi (uniform). The blurb boldly states \\"A Fighting Style for the Real World\\". Techniques should also be shown without the gi. Modern day mixed martial arts tournaments do not involve the uniform. Fighters square off in a pair of trunks only. The art has evolved a lot in the last ten years unfortunately this is not reflected in the book.<br />Overall a decent introduction to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. However there are certainly better books out there. I'm waiting for Gene Simco's book by the looks of things it holds a lot of promise.<br />As an update to this review I'd like to say that the more I look over it, the more holes I find. I wish the book had some more information about the basic control positions. For example, the book lists the basic positions (mount, side control, knee ride, back mount and so forth) but unfortunately does not describe how to properly attain them. It's frustrating to attain a dominant position such as side control and then lose it due to insufficient knowledge of correct technique.<br />Another deficiency is lack of escapes. On numerous occasions I've been caught on arm bars and triangles and have not had the faintest idea how to escape. Although tapping out is an important part of the learning process in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, my training has been much more satisfying since learning how to escape from these common submissions.	2002-11-24

Books	2	1	1	N	N	Could be more practical	This is a book about financial knowledge. Kiyosaki tries to explain, in simple terms what he has learnt about accumulating wealth. The general thrust of the book is put your money into assets (anything that makes you money) and try to limit your liabilities (anything that drains money from your account).<br />I like the book because it is concise, easy to read and easy to understand. In theory the ideas presented are very sound. However, the book falls over by failing to provide practical examples of how to apply the knowledge. Correction, the book does provide specific examples of what the author himself has done to accumulate wealth. Unfortunately, many of the examples rely on various loopholes in United States taxation law and being from Australia, the examples were not applicable to my situation.<br />My main problem with the book is that it says \\"Put all your money into things that will make you money\\" and leaves it at that. It gives general examples such as shares and real estate but does not delve into something more specific that is broadly applicable to most readers.<br />I do wholeheartedly agree with some of the basic principles in the book such as \\"A good education and a good job is no longer enough\\". For this my rating is elevated to three stars.<br />Update - here's another interesting 'review' of the book:...<br />Update 2 - I couldn't post the actual link so here are some examples of gross factual inaccuracies in this book<br />Kiyosaki:<br />A corporation can do so many things that an individual cannot. Like pay for expenses before it pays taxes.<br />Truth: <br />Both corporations and sole proprietors pay expenses before they pay taxes. Sole proprietors pay taxes only on the net income of their businesses, which means after expenses.<br />Kiyosaki:<br />Says friend did a tax-free exchange from a sole-proprietorship rental house to a mini-storage limited partnership. <br />That is explicitly prohibited by Internal Revenue Code Section 1031(a)(2)(B,C,D). Errors like this cause me to marvel at the fact that Kiyosaki's co-author is a CPA.<br />Kiyosaki:<br />Simple math and common sense is [sic] all that is needed to do well financially.<br />Truth:<br />The world is full of non-wealthy people who can do simple math and have common sense. Many additional qualities are needed to succeed in business.<br />After some further reflection I can only revise my rating to two stars.	2002-10-24
US	46034019	R3BOM31UD7GTGX	1931056110	586910971	On Selling	Books	2	3	3	N	N	Too specific	The book is written by the CEO of IMG, a company that manages international stars and athletes. The book is supposed to be about selling however I found it too specific to sports marketing and IMG. For example he talks about taking time, sometimes years to close a deal. He talks about large customers who expect you to \\"entertain him and his people...at least once a month\\". There are many salespeople out there who cannot relate to these scenarios. Many have only one shot to close a deal. Many don't sell to the type of clients who need to be wined and dined.<br />There are many more examples in this book of situations which I feel are not widely applicable. In many senses it is not so much a book on selling as a manual on how IMG conducts its business. There are some useful sales tips inside the book but they are interspersed between largely irrelevant anecdotes.	2002-10-09

As the title suggests, the focus of the book is on various activities that you can do in &quot;one minute&quot;. There is a lot of emphasis on the 80/20 rule, which says that 80% of the work is achieved by 20% of the effort. Basically it is a book about how to effectively prepare and present a sales presentation. The &quot;one minute&quot; stuff is just a brand and at times seems a little forced.<br />I like the book because it is short and easy to read. It contains useful, practical tips that are good if you are a beginner to sales. It puts a lot of emphasis on caring about the customer and finding out their needs, something that we all lose touch with from time to time.<br />Some things I don't like about the book include the third person perspective. Constant phrases such as &quot;he had his doubts&quot;, &quot;he wondered&quot; etc become annoying and a tad confusing over time. The material is presented as a series of exchanges between a novice salesman and the mythical &quot;One Minute Salesperson&quot;. Again unnecessary and garbles the message.<br />All in all a good introductory text if you're new to selling. I got through it within an hour or so and did learn a few things.	2002-09-26

It contains fundamental lessons and the anecdotes it contains are being repeated throughout the world today. Scandals, overly aggressive accounting, generous executive options, corporate greed, folly all have been well documented in this book and all are manifesting themselves today in the form of Anderson, Enron, Worldcom and so forth.<br />I like this book because it focuses on fundamentals. The most successful investors invariably focus on value stocks and long term growth. They look for basics such as earnings and cash flows. They look behind the accounting numbers and are not bamboozled by glossy brochures or big name executives. A wise investor would not have been sucked up by the dot com hype. They would have seen the companies for what they were, overpriced flash-in-the-pans.<br />Whilst this book contains many valuable lessons, the style was dry and at times difficult to get through. So, whilst the book is not an entertaining read, anyone interested in purchasing quality stocks should definitely have a look at this book.	2002-07-06

Superficially it appears to be the Seinfeld of the literary world, that is a book about nothing. The book appears to be a random collection of quotes and anecdotes on seemingly unrelated topics.<br />I like this book because it covers such a diverse range of topics in an interesting manner. You can open up virtually any page in the book and find something amusing, thought provoking or plain bizarre. As an example did you realise that in actuality the world is a very dull place? There is no such thing as colour or sound. These are simply waves with different wavelengths and frequencies. The sensation of light and sound is simply the brain parsing information in a specific way, probably because this model was conducive to survival in primitive times.<br />I must admit a lot of the pages in the book were quite beyond me. I didn't understand why they were there at all and in fact I feel that some of the material should be omitted from the book because it has little value. It also became annoying at times because you have to flip the book sideways and upside down due to its unusual layout (no easy feat with such a hefty tome!).<br />However all in all this book is an excellent read. One of the best books I've read in awhile. Highly recommended if you are interested in exploring the unusual and thinking outside the square.	2002-05-09

He believes that our current system of thinking is excellent, but not enough. He believes we focus too much upon judgement, rather than exploring a subject. He believes we focus too much at looking back to the past rather than designing a way forward.<br />These are all points with which I wholeheartedly agree. So why did I give this book a low rating? I've only read a few of de Bono's other books, however I can already state that 75% of this book was a rehash of older works. The book is very repetitive, and on numerous occasions he offers the same examples over and over again, albeit in different sections of the book.<br />How about the 25% that I hadn't seen before? Well, although there is new material, he covers it in a cursory fashion. He offers some new notations, some suggestions for design although I can't see any way to apply these to my thinking. If you haven't read any of de Bono's other books, then go grab them now! If you have read de Bono's other books, then you have already read this one. In summary I can't really recommend this book to anyone.	2002-04-25

As the author points out, salesmanship is an invaluable skill because you are always selling. Even if you are not a professional salesman, you still constantly try and sell your ideas, your skills, your values to employers, friends, family and so forth.<br />The book is written in a very easy to read style. It is a comprehensive guide that covers a wide range of topics from staying in shape to handling customer objections. The thing I appreciate most about the book is that it focuses upon fundamental principles rather than gimmicky sales techniques. A lot of the book is just common sense, something that the author acknowledges. However, as we all know common sense isn't.<br />There are no profound revelations in this book, despite the author's claim that everything written is a &quot;secret&quot;. It is a good, solid book on salesmanship and I would recommend it to anyone who needs to acquaint themselves with the fundamentals of the sell.	2002-04-21

The book teaches you about using \\"learning maps\\" to improve the learning process by using your visual skills and imagination. There is also a brief overview of memory techniques.<br />The book is very easy to read. It is fairly small, concise and covers the topic in a no-nonsense manner. The book contains useful tips, examples and practical applications of the tools described. Note that these \\"learning maps\\" are identical to the mind maps promoted by Tony Buzan...  Although the book is a good introductory text, I found the treatment rather shallow I would have preferred a book with more detail.<br />If you're completely new to the concept of mind mapping and memory techniques, this book could server as a good primer. Else, have a look at the books of Tony Buzan they're much more worthwhile.	2002-04-13

I have completed university level statistics however, the assigned textbook was dry and difficult to understand. I did do well in the subject, however this was by rote learning past exams rather than any deep understanding of the material. This book changes everything and I only wish I had it when I did my maths course!<br />The book is written in a very clear style. All theory is accompanied by fully worked examples. There are plenty of graphs and explanations to illustrate the point. At the end of each theme, there is a set of problems again with fully worked solutions. Mathematical terms are explained in clear English so that I finally know what &quot;chi square&quot; and &quot;degree of freedom&quot; actually mean.<br />The book is not perfect. As previously mentioned, there are a number of errors in the worked solutions. However, these are quickly spotted. A lot of the time, the book just asks you to accept certain equations, without showing how they are derived. It would have been nice to have an appendix with derivations of the various formulae, so that you could look them up if you were so inclined.<br />However, these small flaws do not detract from what is an excellent text. I'd recommend this text for anyone who needs an understanding of the fundamentals of statistics. I managed to cover a whole semester's work in about 1/10th of the time!	2002-04-06

If you are completely new to memory and mnemonic techniques, then this package will help you improve your memory. The cards, board game and other props do make the task of practising your memory skills more enjoyable. <br />However the book is not a very useful text. It is not very comprehensive and it pales in comparison to Higbee, Lorrayne and other well established memory authors. Although as mentioned above the props do help, this is in part due to a novelty factor which quickly wears off. The most useful item in the pack was the set of cards for memorising faces. The rest were quickly discarded.<br />I would recommend this package if you have someone else who is concurrently learning the art of memory. In this case it would be fun and stimulating to play the games and to make up your own using the props. However, if you are learning by yourself then avoid this package and try Higbee, Lorrayne and Buzan the rewards will be much greater.	2002-04-04

It is divided into three sections, the introduction, offensive information warfare and finally defensive information warfare. Numerous topics are covered. The author is clearly an expert in security and manages to touch upon all the major information security topics.<br />The main strength of the book is the breadth of topic selection. By the time you have reached the end of the book, you will have at least a passing acquaintance with all important information security topics. The book is very well referenced and is written in an easy to read style.<br />The enormous topic selection means that no topic is treated in any particular depth. This means that you'll get to know something about everything, but unfortunately you won't develop an intimate understanding of any of the topics covered.<br />At times I received the impression that the book was simply a collection of anecdotes. Some parts of the book resembled sensationalistic journalism and, four years after it was written, many parts of the book are out of date. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a broad overview of information security. Its scatter gun approach means that you'll hit all of the topics but won't develop a true understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved.	2002-04-03

The book stipulates that the basic failing of Western thinking is its emphasis on judgement and placing everything into categories. Parallel thinking is one alternative which focuses on exploring a subject rather than jumping to conclusions. Parallel thinking is not about obtaining a result, rather it is about designing a way forward.<br />There are many things that I like about this book. Being brought up in the Western education system, I have been locked into the paradigm of critical analysis and the adversarial system. Reading this book, it is apparent that a much more productive approach involves exploring a subject using formal thinking tools. This removes the ego defence whereby I have to defend my point of view against attack.<br />However, I did find a lot repetition in this book. This is a point that de Bono himself acknowledges in the text. There are also lots of references to his other books which could be seen as plugs. These minor details do not detract from the book at all and I would thoroughly recommend &quot;Parallel Thinking&quot; to any open minded individual who is interested in learning about new ways to think.	2002-03-18

Unfortunately, the research is mixed up with anecdotes and conjectures. In extrapolating research data, the authors often make wild guesses as to what proportion of the population is affected by the Adonis Complex. There are also lots of case studies that focus on extreme cases. These amount to little more than sensationalistic journalism.<br />The book does have a lot to offer. The fat free mass index is a great way to calculate your genetic limits with regards to lean body mass. Sample surveys are provided to help diagnose those who may be suffering from the Adonis Complex. The book seems to condemn an obsession with a lean, muscular body. However what people are willing to sacrifice to obtain their goals is just a matter of personal choice and the authors have no right to make judgements upon those who strive to better themselves. A lot of the information is eye opening but I wish they'd just stick to the facts.	2002-03-13

For those people who just want the numbers, many blackjack simulators are currently on the market. In fact, most of the simulators would be more accurate than the numbers in these books due to the fact that you can customise then to your exact table conditions and playing strategies.<br />Even for those who are mathematically inclined, this book is very heavy reading.

As such you won't learn any particular counting system or style. Snyder writes in a clear, witty style with piercing insights into the nature of gambling.<br />Some gems from the book include Social Irrelevance class where you will come to grips with the &quot;existential essence of being a replaceable cog in a machine that produces nothing&quot; and how card counters are essentially parasites &quot;siphoning money from a meaningless cash flow system&quot;. Humour abounds, for example in reviewing one of the blackjack systems, Snyder remarks &quot;My heart goes out to the tree that died for this&quot;.<br />All in all a very worthwhile text covering a whole range of different blackjack topics. Occasionally digresses from the main theme but this is more an observation than a complaint it does not detract from the book whatsoever. <br />The book's final conclusion? You won't win. Why? Statistical fluctuations mean that on a bell curve some will end up all the way on the right and some will end up all the way on the left. Sure with card counting you have an expectation that is slightly positive, however there's still a big margin for statistical variation that could plonk you pretty much anywhere in terms of winnings. In which case you may as well take your bankroll and plonk the thing on the damn roulette wheel.	2002-03-04

It's a book aimed at beginneres by the time you've finished you certainly won't be a blackbelt at blackjack. The systems offered are not the most powerful available.<br />The blurb of the book states that the main advantages of the modern player are shuffle tracking and team play. Unfortunately, automatic shuffling machines make shuffle tracking impossible. Furthermore if you're just beginning blackjack there's a good chance that you'll be going solo and won't have the luxury of a team.<br />A few things I'd like to see included in this book<BR>(a) Risk of ruin - i.e the chances of losing your bankroll given certain playing conditions<BR>(b) Realistic expectations of where you can expect to be monetarily e.g. in the long term 68% of you will be within one standard deviation of the mean, which given xxxxx playing conditions should place you somewhere between -$yyyy and +$zzzzz<BR>(c) More in depth statistics about the power of his playing systems e.g. playing efficiency, betting correlation<BR>(d) More in depth card counting drills<br />However all in all it's a great book it covers a lot of the basics including betting strategy, counting systems, rudimentary counting drills	2002-03-02

Anna Karenina has been described by many people as the greatest novel of all time. I haven't read nearly enough novels to make a statement like that however it is the greatest novel that I have ever read.<br />What makes Anna Karenina such a compelling novel? The plot of the novel is quite ordinary. There are no twists or surprises. Some would argue that the novel is inordinately long. Certainly there are sections where Tolstoy delves into Russian politics and other such details that are irrelevant to the modern day audience. The list of characters is long and it is often difficult to keep track of the minor characters and to remember where they fit in the plot.<br />However, Tolstoy manages to weave incredibly complex and realistic characters. The most rewarding aspects of the novel are when Tolstoy reveals his piercing insights into human nature and the way in which people behave. Certainly if you have ever been in love you will identify with one or more characters in the novel. A very rich and rewarding experience.	2002-01-24

However, it covers a lot more than fat, grease and grime. It digs into the heart of the industry and spans all the way from the meatpacking factory to the checkout counter.<br />This book does confirm everything you always thought was bad about the fast food industry. The introduction is a little disconcerting because the author freely admits to eating plenty of fast food whilst researching the book. Once you reach the end, you start to question how this is possible.<br />The book is welll researched book however I think it relies excessively on anecdotes that are only loosely related to each other and the title of the book. The author seems to get side tracked a bit and none of the revelations are that profound. No mention of what happens when you buy a McDonald's cheeseburger and take it home and leave it for a year (it doesn't go mouldy!)<br />In any case I can't see how Schlosser could fail to mention the effects of switching from beef tallow to vegetable oil. This results in the production of trans fatty acids which are far more toxic than the saturated fat found in beef tallow. Trans fatty acids lower HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) and increase LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol). <br />I can't really recommend this book. If you freely acknowledge that fast food is very unhealthy then you won't really find this useful. On the other hand if you're wolfing down McDonald's a few times a week then maybe you should give this book a thorough read.	2002-01-15

It claims to seek a balance between the \\"popular\\" memory books and the archaic, academic memory literature. This is a goal which it successfully achieves.<br />There are many great things about this book. It covers all the main mnemonic systems. The author provides up to date reviews of relevant literature to comment upon the effectiveness of the systems. He does this in a very clear, easy going style which makes the book enjoyable to read, unlike the hefty academic memory journals. The great thing about this book is that it doesn't hype \\"Super power memory\\" or \\"Photographic memory\\" or any such nonsense. It teaches you not only the techniques but the way in which to correctly apply techniques. Thus, you know what the mnemonic systems are and when to use them.<br />To be honest I can't think of anything that I dislike about this book. The author adopts a very no nonsense approach and I can heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about how to improve their memory.	2001-11-20
