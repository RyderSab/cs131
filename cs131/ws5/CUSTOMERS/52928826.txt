I was totally absorbed into the story of Beth, and her magnificent obsession with chess (and surprisingly drugs).. so much that I hated to reach the last page.. I loved the journey and wished it had a sequel...    so I turned back to page 1 and re-read it a second time.. something I've done with great books.. 100 Years of Solitude, Narcissus and Goldmund, The Illiad, Tolkien's The Ring....    Read the book, you'll enjoy it and Beth will be a person you think about long after you've finished the book.. she'll become part of you and your life... what more can you ask of a novel?    Note: You don't have to be a chess player to enjoy this book.	2004-11-21

I would estimate that there are 200 pages of real content here. There is a long explanation of what actions the trigger on a gun initiate, in order to be sure we understand what an Oracle \\"Trigger\\" is through a long analogy. This is a typical example of where a text is padded out to a  paragraph to explain a concept that could have been done in a sentence. Authors should respect the reader's time and attention. Some of the coverage is very thin and the seams show on the revision for the 9i. We I reviewed the book and noted the highlighted passages, I realized how thin in content this actually was.<br />Still a good first read for a new DBA, but the Wessler or Dawes or even Ault are better, more detailed and ultimately more useful.	2004-05-26

Just because he doesn't care for the book, doesn't mean it didn't &quot;understand&quot; it, and doesn't see th humor. Authors should respect the readers time (and money), really, this book can be reduced to &quot;Everything is IT&quot;, and if you know that, then you don't need the book and if you don't, the book won't help. Nothing terrible about the book, it's just unnecessary, and if you need non-dual reading, then anything else would be a better use of time and paper (Tolle, Ramana, Zen Masters).	2004-02-21

Unfortunately, being enlightened doesn't insure that one is a good writer, nor that he is able to teach enlightenment. This writing is the most tedious, repetitious that I've read. It (7 books) could easily be condensed down to a single chapter or an article. Some good insights, but nothing worth plowing through all the words. At times it seems words are just flowing, just to fill pages and he ultimately forgets what his point was going to be and never arrives. The author should respect the reader's time a bit more, the point is not to fill enough pages to make a book. But ultimately I don't see what the other reviewers saw in these books, more worthwhile to read the clear and concise Huang-Po or Foyan or Krishnamurti or Nisargadatta etc. for more to the point direction.<br />\\"Almaas has answers unique\\".. for the mystic, there is only One answer, it's the method that a teacher must provide.	2004-01-20

In all, I'm grateful for this new analysis and guidance for dealing with this condition.

A friend just gave me this book, and I read it all in one sitting (with sex, greed, power, ego, cultist followers, and yet a true story). After completing it, the most powerful impression that I was left with was one not one stated directly in the book, but appeared so clearly from Baker's own words and actions; \\"Master\\" Dick Baker, even after demonstrating his total disregard for ethics, doesn't get the point; then he simply moved away from San Franciso and set up shop as a Zen \\"Master\\" at another location. That, in my opinion, is the only thing he could have done to convince me, he DIDN'T get the point, doesn't CARE, and intends to USE his \\"transmission\\" from Suzuki for everything it's worth.

Poonja (Papaji) until I read this, and have have studied meditation/philosophy in India and Japan, this book (by a student of Papaji) is probably the least enlightened writing I've encountered (by someone professing to be Enlightened). This book was probably good for the author as self-therapy, it has much discussion about his and other people undergoing therapy (after his drug and alcohol problems) and has a lot of focus on his sexual activity. Some exact quotes \\"It pisses me off. I am bitter about being used as an emotional barf bag, and then discarded. Everyone who knows me knows that I am a wild tantric.\\" and \\"When I make love... I may want to talk dirty. I may feel so surrendered that the desire to be subordinate to the feminine may arise.\\" and \\"[author] appreciated as a sexually ecstatic male, in other words, he was loved as the horny man he is.\\" and \\"He likes sex and makes no apology for not being monogamous.\\"  The point of all this, is that everything as it is, is IT (the Absolute or Consciousness) so any attempt to choose or suppress is unenlightened. Author writes \\"no matter what anyone does they are still divine.\\" This is called BUJI ZEN in Buddhism, the belief that if everything is IT, then everything is OK. The spritual \\"insights\\" are shallow at best (such as explaining the title he says, \\"Why a Paradox? Because being itself includes all enigmas and contradictions.\\" UH! I can't believe someone would even bother to write that. Instead, read the original sources, Ramana Marharshi or even Papaji (but now I have lost any confidence in Papaji's ability to recognize enlightenment). I'm sure that, if you read the first chapter of this in a bookstore , you won't buy it.	2002-04-13

I am a Buddhist, have studied formally in all three main branches of Buddhism and was a monk during the most intense part of my study. I own hundreds of Buddhist texts, and if I could only own one book, this would be it. This is absolutely the clearest expression of Enlightenment I've encountered. Foyan is wonderously clear, avoids reliance on koans and historical cases (but has a few references to them), and instead, simply expresses Realization on his own, directly, brilliantly, in every sentence of this book. A previous reviewer wrote (in his excellent review) &#34;Logical contradictions are purposely employed to get you to see something beyond logic&#34;, while there are a few statements like that, that is a slight misunderstanding of why most of the apparently &#34;contadictions&#34; are there. Instead these &#34;contradictions&#34; are direct expressions of the Truth of Reality, and that requires 1) that you see directly and don't confuse the labels for the reality itself and 2) that everything be seen simultaneously from both sides (the relative or functional view and the absolute). So a statement such as &#34;you must have nonseeing right in seeing&#34; or<br />&#34;all that is necessary is that there is no hearer or heard when you hear&#34; is presenting both sides, not negating one with the other. However, there are statements such as &#34;the ancients told you.. all sounds are Buddha's voice... You have misunderstood, supposing that all sounds are actually the voice of Buddha&#34; that appears to be a contradiction, but again this is pointing out (POINTING not explaining) the diffence between the understanding and the perception of that truth. I've said much too much, the Zen Master would be beating me over the head with the stick by now. You will enjoy this book, and you will hear the voice of Enlightenment speaking across 9 centuries of time, if you get this book, you'll need no others, and eventually you can give this one away. My Highest recommendation.	2002-01-10

If you get IT, this book (and his later writings) can change you life. This is difficult reading, but so very rewarding. However, Being and Time is not the place to begin reading Heidegger. There are several very excellent introductions: Steiner's Martin Heidegger,and Macquarrie's Heidegger and Christianity both are very excellent. When you read Being and Time (which is so much better than Sartre's more famous gloss, Being and Nothingness) you WILL need a commentary. I approached Heidegger as a Buddhist, so his main concept, dealing with the recognization of Being, was very familar to me. I found Heidegger to be wonderfully enriching in my own insight into the most essential question of philosophy. I studied German for 2 years in order to read Heidegger in his Original langauage (and also to read Rilke's poetry in it's original). The German source is very precise (a trait of the German language, which lends itself to precision of language with new word combinations to create new expressions). The terms are necessary to get us to see the meaning that would not be visible with out new expressions. For me this works, and put into words (as nearly as anyone has) some of the great \\"mystical\\" insights. If you are reading only in English, you must have a commentary and both translations; start with the Joan Stambaugh, it is easier reading; but you will need the older Macquarrie & Robinson translation for comparison. Some concepts are better explained in one, some in the other. Also recommended Basic Writings : From Being and Time (1927 to the Task of Thinking) and WHAT ARE POETS FOR? and Heidegger's writing on Kant and Holderin. If you enjoy philosophy, this has my highest recommendation. This is philosophy that will awaken you in this moment.	2002-01-10

I'd like to see a more careful (more direct) translation of this great work. This version is good, certainly a much better reading than the disastrously attempt at rewriting by Anita Barrows. But why rewrite and interpret in the translation, I'd prefer more precision. Some examples from the first page: the beautiful passage, 'I live my life in expanding (growing) circles' has a phrase 'Ich weiss noch nicht' very easy to translate as 'I know not yet' or 'I don't yet know' here it is translated as 'yet unclear of my role' (which adds interpretation, and misses some of the beauty of Rilkes style). And 'um den uralten Turm' is translated 'around the tower of old', which is not bad but isn't  'around the ancient tower.' more poetic? And the wonderous conclusion of the passage is 'bin ich ein Falke, ein Sturm oder ein grosser Gesang' which is translated as 'be it falcon or storm or another magnificent song? instead of the direct 'am I a falcon, a storm, or a great song'.    Another example in this paragraph is 'Ich kreise um Gott'.und ich kreise jahrtausendelang? this passage poetically uses the word 'kreise' twice to create a symmetry 'I circle around God'. and I circle (for) thousands of years? instead it is translated 'I circle around God and I spin amidst thousands of years' (which is very nice, but not what I see in the German). So for the paragraph we have 'I circle around God, around the tower of old, and I spin amidst thousands of years; yet unclear of my role, be it falcon or storm or another magnificent song.' instead of 'I circle around God, around the ancient tower, and I circle for thousands of years; and I know not yet, am I a falcon, a storm, or a great song.'  Well, in any case, I do recommend this translation as the best available, but hope another will appear in the near future or this one will be revised.   Updated. now that I've done my own translation, I realize how difficult it is to translate poetry, so I'm give this one 4 stars. I think adding footnotes would help, by explaining the alternatives for translating a sentence and would help get the meaning through and free the translator to seek the poetic.	2001-12-26

Every event, decision, feeling of Schumann is analyzed in psychological terms, and never insightful in any way.. each of the (TOO FREQUENT) observations breaks the flow of the story, and they never provide insights that we wouldn't have drawn ourselves, and this finally distracts so much that the reading becomes tedious. For example, what is the point of telling the reader about the psychological effects of a death of a sister or father? I'm a human being, I know this all too well, just tell the story of this great composer.. the only point of reading this ultimately is to make the music come alive for me. There is not much discussion of Schumann's music, what is there is not deep enough to provide any deeping of appreciation or understanding of the music. Regret I didn't get the other newer biography (but more expensive)	2001-12-19

Homosexual message..exact quotes within	Bought this by accident (looking for C.S. Lewis). I'm not sure who the intended audience is, it is written at a teenage level, and poorly written at that. But the content is not suitable for children, says child homosexual encounters are \\"normal\\", very perverse message.. <BR>The book's main message is \\"nothing's wrong, all is a learning experience and God certainly won't judge you for that... \\" Here is a direct quote \\"You have had a number of homosexual experiences. ... Get rid of the guilt. Ask God to take it away. Once the guilt is gone then you can see how exciting a fantasy about this experience is to you. Whether you like sex with males ore females or both doesn't matter to God, \\" said the stranger. \\"But,\\" Nathaniel hesitated, \\"the Bible says unnatural sex is a sin.\\" \\"YES, SO WHAT?\\" the stranger said sympathetically. \\"God doesn't know of sin.\\" <BR>I think this may appeal to some people that are distanced from God by their own behavior ... but it is certainly misguided to take spiritual reassurance from a feel good new-age book of fiction.. Better to look into the direct source and deal with Reality (God, Self, Life). Read your own scriptures and avoid this.	2001-10-01

I like Mandelbaum's translation best..  However here I am reviewing the audio tape reading of the Boer translation with Noah Pikes as narrator. The quality of the recording is horrible, but even worse is the &quot;performance&quot; of the narrator. Because of the extreme histrionics (to put it mildly), poor diction, it is impossible to understand 90% of the words. and the reading is stilted and sounds like Tonto (yes, of the Lone Ranger) reading. It is only a few selections from the Metamorphoses, poorly choosen at that.. easily the worst puchase I've made at Amazon (of over 1500 items so far). 1 Star is too high a rating..
