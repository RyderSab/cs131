There were even a couple of pages that had me lauging even more than in the first (and still the best book in the series)'Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging'.  Even though the general theme throughout the last four books is different in this one it was still great - and Jas finnaly became less annoying and once more a pleasure to read about.<BR>  I was kinda disapointed to see that April Fools day was an entry and there wasnt any tales of Georgia pulling any pranks - come on!  Im sure she would have something in store for Elvis and a few other of her teachers - probably even Jas.<BR>  It would seem after Sven's return we never saw him again, that didnt seem quite right but everything else was great.  There are a few unanswerd questions so Im pritty sure that there is gonna be another sequel for us.<BR>  I deffinately recomend this book.	2004-05-25

Compared to other young adult books it deserves four, but as part of Rennison's series I would only give it a measly three.<BR>  It is more serious than the rest, and I only laughed a total of three times as opposed to several laughs per page in the first instalment.  The books in this series have been gradually getting worse and worse.  <BR>  Hopefully with the near release of 'Away Lauging On A Fast Camel' the un-answered questions in 'Nuddy Pants' will be answered.  Plus there has been a slight break between the release of 'Nuddy Pants' and 'Away Lauging' hopefully giving Rennison time to think of more ideas.<BR>  All in all it wasnt a bad book, but it didnt shine like some of its predecessors.	2004-05-21

But it did have a lot to live up to.  Yes the second instalment of the series is full of laughs, but its just not as good/funny as the first.  This one is only over the span of two months (the first is a whole year - this isnt a problem, just thought Id bring it up).  A few days are repeated from the last book - however our heroine Georgia seems to have done different things!<BR>  One of the things I didn't like about this one is the words the 'Ace gang' pick up from Ellan's brother, like \\"Poo Parlor Devision\\" or \\"Nippy Noodles\\", they just seemed immature - even for them.  Most other 'funny' things Georgia said had something inteligent about them.  Unfortunately the same thing can-not be said about these phrases.<BR>  Also the first book talks about Georgia showing \\"promise\\" in tennis, however in this one she is all about hockey!  What happened there?  <BR>  The mother storyline in this one was VERY simmilar to in the first book, and the book on a whole ended in a simmilar way.<BR>  Having said that I laughed out loud MANY times while reading this book and highly recomend it for anyone hoping for a laugh.	2004-05-18

Sadly 'Knocked Out By My Nunga-Nungas' was not only not as good as the first book in the series but not even the second.<BR>  Georgias time in Ouch Eye Land was borderline boring - where is that laugh a minuet humor?  The story line with the parents is not nearly as interesting as in the past, same with Angus and Libby.  Then we get to Jas - she has become highly annoying and stuck up, Im waiting for her and Tom to break up to bring her back to reality.  \\"You have to let Jas rave on or you never get to talk about yourself\\" how many times have we heared Georgia say that?!  And how many times have we un-caringly heared Jas go on?  Too many thats for sure.  <BR>  I did like the Dave The Laugh story line in this one, and most events that happened beyond P.70 were funny.  I hope the fourth one doesnt continue the downwards spiral, I would hate to give a Louise Rennison book a 3/5.	2004-05-18

It truely is a laugh a minuet.  In my oppinion Georgia has a normal life, she just chooses to spice it up at every oppotunity.  I love the way she has a crazy (yet appropriate) nick-name for everyone.  I LOVE all the charectors in this book.  I think the best thing about it is that Georgia is NEVER serious - she describes her worst situations in the most hilarious way.<BR>  Others have said not to read this in public, I will also add night to that when others are asleep because you are sure to wake them up with laughter.	2004-05-18

I like the fact that both Jack and Andie were included, that is a major plus.  In some of these books based on TV shows the charectors in the books act different to how they do on the show, but for the most part that was not the case for this book, the charecters acted very much like themselfs.  The reason I give it four stars as opposed to five is that each main charector had his or her own story line until around the last fourty pages.  Sure they were intertwined a little, but I would have liked to have seen them together throughout the book.  All in all it was a good read.	2004-04-22

Dawson was too low and depressing in this one, I really wish these books would move away from the whole Dawson-Joey thing cos it gets boring and irritating, much like Patrice in this story.  Although there were some funny lines, there needed to be more light hearted moments as the book gave off a sad vibe the entire time.  It was rather predictable, but the story moved along nicely.  If your a fan of DC youll probably enjoy it, although I would recoment \\"Major Meltdown\\" or \\"shifting In To Overdrive\\" first.	2002-06-21

I have to say that I was very impressed, I realy liked this one and was glad to see that Valarie was involved and its not about Sabrina and her family as that has got real old.  I would go as far as saying this is one of the best Sabrina books, so read it!  If you like it I also recomend \\"showdown at the mall\\", \\"Prizoner of cabin 13\\" and \\"sabrian goes to Rome\\".

Its mostly about Isabel, but sets the other charecters up for storylines in future books.  It has you turning the pages until the very end wondering when Isabel is going to see sense and whats going to happen to her boyfriend.  Their wild adventures are also somewhat page turning.  The only downside of this book is that it seems to end in the middle introducing new plot lines and not explaining what happens.  That comes in the next book, which I'm looking forward to becasue this one was so good, and I want to know what happens!	2002-04-04

For so long I thought that Harry Potter books were just kids storys and never bothered to read them.  My friends who did read them I thought were over exagerating.  I only picked up this book when I had to have a British written book for a book report and figured I would give it a try with little hope.  I was truely amazed and finnaly understood everyone who had been going on about \\"the famous, great\\" Harry Potter for so many years.  This story holds so much imagination and creativity, with a plot I am clueless to how J. K. Rowling came up with, the book is beond words for me to describe, I think only she could do it.  I never knew what was comming next and could not stop at the end of each chapter as they were great cliff hangers.  I was astonished how it all comes together and fits so perfectly.  Everyone, young or old should read this.  A common question is weather this one can be read before the first one \\"The Saucerers Stone\\" and I say yes, I did and anything that is explained in the first one is easy to catch on in the second one.  Read this to make your life complete!	2002-02-17

This is what i was expecting:  Episode guide, charector pages, behind the scenes, pictures ect.  The episode guide is there, but thats about all, the rest is about spells and been a wican, so if your in to that, this is great for you and you dont even need to be a fan of the show, but if your a fan who is not in to doing the sisters activities, dont expect to get a whole lot out of the book.

Seems like you were drinking,   After writing this book,   You sure had good luck,   Could the publisher read?
