The concept is:In the south pacific or somewhere near it, a vessel is resting on the ocean floor. It has crash-landed in the ocean. A group of American scientists are then sent to investigate this vessel. That's all I can tell you. Michael's best. This was a real page-turner, and the ending was so suspense, I prayed that they were gonna make it. The scientific evidense is amazing. No problems with this book, it was superbly planned out. ENJOY!	2001-09-22

This book...I don't know, there was something missing. We had everyone you know? Regis, Drizzt, Bruneor, Catti-brie, Artemis, Jarlaxle, Wulfgar, etc. So why is it so mediocre? Well, for starters, it was too slow. That chapter with Wulfgar and Drizzt fighting giants? 31 pages. Also, Drizzt is not questionable and not finding more about him. Also, the Artemis in Calimport was a pain to read. Personally, that was of little importance and should've been put in another book. 10 new charecters in one place, 8 of them die. Also, the endless talk of Regis's love of food. Somewhere i'm screaming CHARECTER DEVOLPMENT. The only thing from saving it was the giant battle at the end. But then Drizzt fakes a death. Why is our hereos invincible? None of the Drizzt gang has REALLY died. Just, near fatal wounding. And let's not forget the battles. It seems now that they can take whole armies. But the greatest thing about this book was Wulfgar. That saved the book from disaster. I loved hearing about Wulfgar and his leaving the group. I feel sorry for him. I'll be glad to hear more from him in the next book. For now, however, this is parring with Legacy.	2001-07-23

This is pretty much a regular ol' Drizzt novel until Part 5. Errtu still bugs the crap out of me. I'm REALLY, REALLY, glad that Artemis wasn't in this book. Anyway, there are 2 plots that fit almost perfectly in the book.<br />1)Drizzt and Catti-brie have been sailing the Sword Coast for 6 YEARS! When they stop at Waterdeep, their captain gets attacked by a doppleganger and gets a note for Drizzt to go to Cameyln, a supposed-to-be ghost island. When they get there, an old hag tells him that there is an old enemy who has one of his dead friends. <br />2)Errtu contiues his search for the Crystal shard by using Drizzt as bait to find his &quot;dead&quot; father.

Then I MIGHT give up. There was 130-140 pages of the battle, like The Legacy. Drizzt is kind of dropping on charecter development. But, Regis and Catti-brie are devolping. I love the part where Harkle misplaces his eyes(It's hard to explain if you haven't read it), and ERRTU IS BACK! YEA! Artemis took a break on this book (Thank god foor that. He's been in all the Drizzt books sinse Streams...)All in all, a very good book. Oh, the plot is that Matron Banere plans to seek revenge on Drizzt and start a war at Mithrall Hall. Drizzt and company must stop the Drows. Also, Errtu is getting help from Lloth(Yes, Lloth) on getting out of his banishment. That pretty much sums it up. END!	2001-04-26

Starless Night is one of those few books that are better than the first one. In this Drizzt book, Drizzt decides to go to Menzoberranzan to see what has happened to his long lost tribe. I really liked what happened to Artemis. He seems to be losing his evil touch. Catti-brie really shines in this book. I really feel sorry for her. Her loss of Wulfgar is just too much. Silverymoon is a great place to go in the Forgotten Realms, even if it doesn't put in with the story (which it did). Drizzt is kind of losing his fighting skills. I really wished Rwgis was in the Underdark too. Oh well. I hope the sequel will be good.	2001-04-21

It has really good battle parts and some nice dialogue and description. However, it's not his best. The battle parts seem to take up the whole book. It takes forever for Bruneor and gang to find Drizzt, and when they do, the book's over. The idea of changing from a human into a halfling was very cool. Once again, Artemis shows how great a charecter he is. However, I do feel sorry for Catti-brie. I'm not gonna tell you what happened, but it almost made me cry. There are some problems with the book, but hopefully that will be solved in the next book, which i'm glad this book wasn't his last Drizzt book. Enjoy! Rating:Teen has bloodshed and language.

I now curse myself for reading it. However, I gave Crichton a second chance. Eaters of the Dead is about a Arab minstrel named Ahamad ibn-Fadlan (there's a much longer name in the book) leaves his city of Baghdad as ordered by the King, and sets off on a long journey to the Northlands. I really liked this book. The action scenes were short, but there were many. A nice combination of real stories and Beowulf, the famous poem. Rothgar and Ahamad are my favorite charecters. I wish there was more to say about this book. Well, If you hated Timeline, pick this book up, you'll love it!	2001-04-10

The story begins in Emond's Field, where Rand A'lthor weorks his daily life as a sheepherder. Little does he know he is going on the biggest adventure of his life with his friends, Mat and Perrin. So big, that there are, so far, 9 books of his adventure. All the women were good (Morriane, Egwene, Nyaneve) and I really liked Thom the gleeman(I would like to hear the songs he played). There were some resemblances to Tolkien, however. There's an Eye of the world, and The Green Man reminds me of the Ents. However, the way Jordan describes the story maakes it unqiue and original. This was a fun story to read, despite its length (782 pages). I hope to have as much fun with the sequel.	2001-04-06

I wanted to learn more about the Hundred Years War.<br />3)Sometimes it's TOO long.

This book really puts down all the last remaining questions about Drizzt. Warning, though. There is no Regis. Roddy McDowell (I'm sorry if I got his name wrong.)was my top 3rd favorite charecter. I really liked Montolio the ranger. And, this gives a good moral:Do not think war heroes are good for battles. They have to be good for their courage, love, and understanding. People say R.A.

Wow, this book is a astounishing story about Paul Mua'dib Atriedies, who brings down the Harkonennes and becomes the greatest Duke of Atriedies of all time.<br />Good job keeping the story together. It got a little confusing near the end of book 2, but I managed to know what was happening. I saw the Mini-series before the book, so I'm not that fond with it. I think the Mini-series made up some parts to keep the viewer intrested. Just a little warning before you see the mini-series.<br />The book is just great, and the 1984 movie is just terrible.

I couldn't finish this book without saying &quot;Why? Why?

This book is not better than the 1st, as what the Icewind Dale Trilogy was like. (Say what you will, I think Streams of Silver is R.A Salvatore's best work.)<br />This takes place in the Underdark, mostly, where Drizzt has exiled from his drow homeland. He has very strange adventures (most of them with his friend in the city, Belwar.) and decides to go to the surface. I felt some syumpathy with Drizzt of leaving his cruel homeland to go into the harsh surface. Guenhyvar's (sorry if I spelled it wrong)charecter devolpment gets better with each passing book, and my 2nd favorite charecter was Clacker (poor guy), although Belwar was up there (Is it me, or does her say &quot;magga camara&quot; WAY TOO MUCH?)<br />Anyway, this is a fast read, took me 5 days, I hope you'll like it too.

At only 603 pages, the next 25 years of the Dune history is filled with excellent stories, brilliant dialogue, and a sort-of happy ending.

My favorite chapter was, of course, Of Beren &amp; Luthien. It was a little confusing, in the middle, but I got over it. I liked the dark elf chapter. And, for LOTR fans, Galdriel is in a few pages.	2000-12-13

This is THE book if you want to know about Drizzt, Forgotten Realms, or if you liked Lord of the Rings. This book is probably the best one out of all 3. Akar Kessel, the evil guy, wants to take over Icewind Dale by using The Crystal Shard. Drizzt, Wulfgar, Bruenor, and Regis must stop him before his orc army destroys all of Icewind Dale. Also, there is a barbarian attack in Ten-Towns. You'll like this book if your a sci-fi fan. The book has some moments that were like The Hobbit, however. With the &quot;Icingdeath&quot; creature, and the tower sounded a lot like Minas Tirith from Lord of the Rings. But, it's his first published story, what do you expect? Pretty good.	2000-12-01

The Hobbit is about Bilbo Baggins. One day, Gandalf, a wizard, fooled Bilbo into an adventure. The adventure is to get back &quot;stolen treasure&quot; from Smaug and bring it back to the dwarves of Laketown.I cant describe in words how great this book is! You'll have to read it for yourself!	2000-12-01

I'm sorry about the horrible review I gave for this book. All i said was &quot;Better than the first! What else can i Say!&quot; Let me start anew. This book is my favorite Salvatore book that he's written so far. He writes down such amazing detail, yet makes it so simple, you feel like your there in every part. The book immediatly starts where Crystal Shard left off. Drizzt, Wulfgar, Bruneor, and Regis are off to find the ancient dwarven home known as Mithrall Hall. Drizzt is off just to help, but learns that he must fight racism(like real life), Wulfgar is trying to like magics and give up greedy traditions. Regis is running away from the most deadly assassin of all, and Bruneor is fighting and helping to make his way back to home.<br />I felt that this is his best work yet. With some parts that are a little borrowed, but with more emotion and desription which makes it totally original. Very good 2nd book.	2000-12-01
