There seemed to be such an injustice behind the story -- one that even the creator of the novel didn't recognize.  I always hated Rochester and his treatment of his first wife.  He was below contempt.  It seemed to me that these two cold English people destroyed this warm creole woman.  Anyway, this is the perfect story of what could have happened -- and it is well written and quite enjoyable.	2005-10-11

Imagine a world where everyone is sorted by which medieval \\"humour\\" they fit into -- all the choleric people are together, separate from all the melancholics, etc.  I thought it an interesting premise that gave structure to the author's exploration of identify, value, etc.  My only qualm comes from the fact that I'm not an intellectual and usually like my books to end in a happy summation wherein all mysteries are solved.  But, as in real life, it doesn't happen here.  I happened upon this book by accident -- I was locked out of my house and forced to spend the evening at the local library, with the reward of discovering a new author whose books I look forward to reading.  I recommend this book to anyone with an evening to pass and a desire to read something that isn't in the common run of things.	2005-09-16

To paraphrase Erasmus, if they have a little money left over, they don't spend it on food or shelter.  They buy books.  When I was in college, I lived on a can of greenbeans a week (plus a little Tang), and all my food budget went for books.  So this book was a little bit of heaven for me.  Imagine finding a little town in Wales, pop around 1,500, with 40 book stores!  The author should lead pilgrimages -- I am sure they would always be full!  On top of the lovely bits of information, the author also presents a wonderful picture of his family's experience there, as they try to decide whether or not to buy a house a stay there.  The author is such a good writer that you feel that you have just met the most marvelous people.  I recommend this book without reservation.	2005-09-14

To be honest, I was surprised to discover an old counterculture hero was such a combination of earnestness and flimflam opportunism.  Too bad.<br /><br />But having said that, I guess few of us are totally consistent in our lives.  But in a way, isn't that the definition of integrity?  So, I don't think Watts had much integrity, if this book is accurate.  But he was obviously a profoundly talented man who moved many people to broaden their view of the world.  And that is worth a lot.<br /><br />As for all the adoring young women that he took advantage of, well, perhaps we are applying today's values on yesterday.  They didn't think it was so wrong for a person in authority to have affairs with their students.  Today it is abhorrent and certainly a firable offence -- but  I doubt he understood the dynamics of abuse in that sort of situation.<br /><br />As for the business about him and \\"spanking,\\" I don't think that needed to be included.  Did we really want to know that??<br /><br />But I do recommend the book.  It is good to remember that people are just people.  As the Buddhists would say, a finger pointing at the moon is not the moon.  So what did anyone really expect.	2005-09-14

Unfortunately, in the first book, she dies suddenly, but quickly returns as queen of the vampires.  As she rises, she is filled with rage as she realizes her stepmother has planned to bury her in cheap shoes.  The story goes from there.  It is very, very funny in places (though a bit raunchy, unfortunately, also).  In the second book, we find Betsy looking for a job and going to work in a shoe department in a nice store.  In this book, we find her tracking down a long lost sister who may be a threat to the entire world.  Well, it is a lot weaker in plot than the others, but still has a certain charm.  While I did not care for it so much, I will certainly read the next one.	2005-08-16

The first book disturbed me a lot, but I have to say that the second one answers many of my questions, and I have a bit more faith that Dexter isn't going to suddenly attack the children in the books.<br /><br />At any rate, what makes these stories readable is the wit and intelligence with which the author writes.

The basic plot:  People are called, in dreams, to a central american village where 24 are given visionary messages to take to the world, announcing that the apocalypse is here.  In support of the message, the traditional \\"signs\\" appear (sores, die off of living creatures in the ocean, famine, etc.).  Everything seems pretty awful and pretty straightforward...or does it?  Catholic priest Michele Deauchez and New York Times reporter Simon Hill suspect there may be something else going on -- a conspiracy of incredible magnitude.  But, as a gentle tibetan lama says, \\"just because it isn't from God, doesn't mean it isn't the end of the world.\\"  That is all I can say without giving too much away.  This is fun reading, well plotted, and well paced.  I highly recommend it if you like this genre.	2005-07-24

I certainly didn't foresee the plot turns, and found the book enjoyable.  My only quibble?  If you add up everything in the stories, 2 and 2 aren't equalling 4.  I don't want to spoil the story, so I will just say that the character that dies (and everyone knows that is going to happen, right?  It was all anyone was talking about)did not behave in a manner that was consistent with his/her behavior in previous books.  And the lead in to the death was just almost too Deus ex Machina for me.  Someone had to die, so someone who should not have been so foolish and helpless became so.  But having said that, I'll buy and read the next one.	2005-07-22

Well, it is wonderful.  Perfect examples are books like Tim Powers \\"stress of her regard,\\" that actually makes the poetry of romanticism (Keats, Shelly, Byron, Coleridge) work as poetry about real vampiric mythic creatures in love with the poets.  Also, Lisa Goldstein's marvelous stories like \\"Dark Cities Underground.\\"  These are good fantasies.  And now, at last, another author.  This is a marvelous story that combines physics, weapons of mass destruction, kabbalah, and karmic destiny.  Read this if you enjoy those kinds of books.	2005-07-15

I am astounded to find that I am the first to write a review.  This is a very good book.  The premise is that people live in various artificial communities/satellites, and also in various artificial mental constructs.  What happens when these constructs are challenged?

I was very disappointed in this one.  First, I had just finished reading a very well written book, and the contrast seemed extreme when I began reading this one.  It almost seemed like a first draft of a novel.  The writing just wasn't very good.  Re the christianity/history problems, well, this is just a novel.  We can all suspend disbelieve and read a novel within the context of its own world.  But still, it did all seem rather silly.  Yes, it did kind of seem like a Da Vinci rip off.  And that is hard to say, given that Reichs (even at her worse) is a world above Mr. Brown's style.  Having said all that, the forensic info was, as always, very interesting.  I just wish she would stick with Montreal.  I missed those characters a lot.  I now look forward to her next book.  I hope it is better.	2005-07-05

The mystery was well drawn and tight; while clues abound, they are not obvious and the story also brings in a lot of interesting items re the patriot act.  So this is both entertaining and worthwhile.  I do have a quibble with the author which I have to be circumspect with, since I don't want to give anything away.  Let's just say that one character's death is an awfully easy out so that certain political issues don't, in the end, have to be dealt with.  But I can see that it was almost inevitable, given the impossibility of resolution re this character.  At any rate, I recommend the book.  Enjoy.	2005-07-05

It would seem that such a style would be distracting, but it wasn't.  My only quibble with the author is that I wanted more.  I certainly wanted to know what happened to Professor Bora (met in Turkey).  And more than any of it, I wanted to know what happened to Dracula's library....  Read this book if you enjoy books about archives, ancient battles, secret knowledge, etc.	2005-07-03

While this author may not have the fame (or actually as good a talent) as Jane A., she still does a great job.  This is a romance, of sorts.  A very shallow young society woman (London) marries a Scot who, while wellbred, is a bumpkin by London standards.  Twins are born, the couple separates.  One twin is reared in London, the other in Scotland.  One twin is shallow, the other has good sense.  This is great good fun and a wonderful read.  It is a shame that it is often only discovered in \\"History of English Literature\\" courses (where I got my first taste).  I recommend this book highly.	2005-06-29

Supposedly, the author met this Saudi princess some years before the book was written, and then told her story in the book. Amazing story of dominated, abused women who still have fantastic intelligence and individualism.  I am assuming that the main character, Sultana, must be a composite character, or it would be quite easy to identify her.<br /><br />I suspect that not all women in Saudi Arabia live as she does, obviously, or were as resentful of their perceived oppression.  Having lived in purdah in my life, I personally found it liberating, and it presented zero problems for me.  A happy person is a happy person.  I suppose though that if a woman was trapped there, with no way out, it could get maddening.<br /><br />I was particularly disturbed by the story of the young woman drowned in her pool, and the young woman locked in a room for the rest of her life.  I found it difficult to understand how the princess could just skip to a new subject...  I guess there is nothing one can do, but still...<br /><br />I was also happy to see that this book was not a criticism of their religion, but rather a calling into question of specific interpretations.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent book.	2005-06-27

Turns out the missing dad is also being hunted by thugs he previously worked for.  Meanwhile, the hero's girl friend is effectively fighting a mean ex-spouse.

It is the autobiography of Dr. Catherine Hamlin and the work she and her husband have done to establish a hospital treating obstetric fistula in Ethiopia.  What an amazing story.  I had never heard of obstetric fistula till a few days ago.  I did not know that so many young women (girls, really) in some parts of the world have child birth complications that cause holes in the vagina through which feces and urine leak constantly, leading to the women becoming abandoned pariahs.  And the repair surgery costs only about $300 -- but this was essentially unavailable until the Hamlins came to Ethiopia in 1960.  What wonderful work they have done, along with their wonderful, competent Ethiopian staff and colleagues.  In addition to that basic theme, Hamlin tells an engrossing story about the overthrow of the emperor, the years of communist regime (many of her friends were murdered), and then the current improved situation.  What a story!  This book about her faith and her work is well worth reading.  I hope many, many people enjoy this book and are inspired to donate to this hospital.	2005-06-18

The mother would rather paint then feed her children; the father steals from the kids to get drunk. There is frequently no food at all, and the children are left unsupervised in blood chilling circumstances. These are parents who are dishonest with their children and theirselves.  But having said that, just when you really find them horrible, they will do something so wonderful that you are just amazed.  I especially liked how the dad taught the author how to fight demons that might live under the bed...this is real fathering.  And the mother had her moments, too.  I really recommend this book if you want to understand how people could live so badly and so well at the same time.	2005-06-16

This book led to a lifetime of reading (and, I hope, practice)that has always appreciated prayer and solitude.  But really, this is an interesting book for anyone who wants a good description of what a monk is, why a monk is, and who a monk seeks, along with a description of different types of monks -- both those who live in community and those who stress solitude.  Is the book dated?  Probably in some ways -- but because Merton gets at root causes and motives, I think it still stands well today.  I recommend this lovely book to anyone interested, or intrigued, by the subject.	2005-06-05

There were some historical inaccuracies, but who cares.  This is just a good summer mystery and held together enough for me to read it straight through in an afternoon.	2005-06-03

She deserves a better biographer, however.  The author makes a good try, but I noticed a lot of inconsistencies in the narrative (not to mention quite a few copy editing errors).  For example, she states that Palmo finds a home in buddhism because she can't believe in an actual, external \\"God.\\"  Then she goes on to say, several chapters down the line, that Palmo calls upon various feminine gods for assistance.  If those aren't external \\"Gods\\" I don't know what are.  But I certainly don't cast blame on Palmo or buddhism, but rather believe that the author was confused about what Palmo was saying.  Having said all that, it is certainly a compelling story.  Palmo is obviously a very sincere, devout person, and has a great role to play in the enfranchising of buddhist nuns -- drawing attention to their need for equality and the opportunities for education that are given to their male counterparts.  In addition, Palmo's commitment to helping all sentient beings is indeed inspirational.  Truly, a fascinating book -- but I would like to see the story told by someone who does a better job at it.	2005-05-31

This book is so dated, however, that it is difficult to get any kind of handle on how de Foucauld found God.  Honestly, reading it, I kept having the creepy feeling that he was killed because he was an agent of French conquest of North Africa, rather than because of his Christianity.  I am not so sure he is a martyr.  But he is certainly a saint.  By the end of his life, he was on fire with the love of God.  Unfortunately, that love of God is quite mixed in with the love of France.  But, then, that's how things were.  Surely, God understands all that, and we should, too.  I would love to read a good contemporary study of de Foucauld.  Certainly, his passion for God and for living the humblest, simplest life possible has led to the creation of several religious orders that do exactly that.  And that is quite amazing and wonderful.	2005-05-31

Nor is it strictly a biography of her.  The author gives us points in his life when Therese intersected with his personal history -- sadness as a little boy, alienation as a young soldier, etc., mixing in the story of Therese and her family and her particular spirituality.  The book is easy reading and very straighforward -- it should be approachable by all sorts of people.  I found it very touching.  And, as anyone who is also a follower of Therese knows, it is nice to hear from others of the same orientation.  I highly recommend this book.  I have, however, one very small quibble:  there were just a couple of proofreading errors.  But these are so minor (like the date of death of Joan of Arc), that it really doesn't affect the book or its impact.  Thank you Mr. Cavanaugh for a thoughful afternoon and evening of reading.	2005-04-13

This is a herculean task, of special importance in that the last few remaining speakers are passing away.  It is to be hoped that this fine work will find success in academic circles, certainly, but even more importantly, that the current resurgence in interest in the language will find this a valuable tool.  Anyone who loves language, as I do, will recognize the brilliance with which Dr. Quintero approached this task.

When I saw this book in the \\"new fiction\\" stack at the library, I was astounded, since I would have thought the author would have either passed away, or at least stopped writing, a long long time ago.  He began publishing his books almost 60 years ago.  Although I share neither the class nor the education of this author, I have always found his books as beautiful as perfectly polished stones.  They do not \\"live\\" in the way some fiction does, yet you can never forget his characters.  This book is no different.  It is a sort of chronicle of a family's history, starting in Scotland before the American Civil War, through immigration and settling here in the states.  Each generation is seen and described by certain members of that generation.  This could be very dry, yet it never fails to entertain.  Golly, Mr. Auchincloss!

The protagonist, or \\"hero,\\" if we can call him that, works as a splatter specialist for the police in Miami.  He is also a serial killer that only kills \\"bad\\" people.

He knows how to mimic normal human relationships.  But every now and then, he has to kill someone.  He finds other serial killers to kill.  No matter how much this might make him a sort of \\"good guy,\\" the truth is that it would only be a matter of time before he feels compelled to kill someone else.  I found it just so bleak.

He and a group of other soldiers that he has resurrected go after a possible starship that has been abandoned by the ancient, dead civilization of the Martians.

There is no new plot -- you have seen this \\"black widow\\" kind of story many times before in book and film.  But it is well done with a switching of narrative voice.  There is a subplot of sorts about the killer's mother, which remains extremely undeveloped -- I thought the author could have given us more in terms of motives from that direction.  At any rate, it is worth a few hours enjoyable escapism reading.	2005-02-28

I have tried to find out who owns the copyright so that, if it is out of copyright, I could simply scan it onto the web.  Can't find out however.  The author was a famous expert in law in the middle years of the twentieth century.  Of Chinese origin, he grew up steeped in Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.  As a young adult, he converted to Christianity, with a special love for St. Therese and her \\"little way of love.\\"  This book discusses the three-fold path that traditional Christianity follows (purgative, illuminative, and unitive) in the light of the carmelite teachings.  But what makes this work special is the lucid and loving thinking of the author.  It is unfortunate that the book is only available used and usual at awful prices (sometimes in excess of $100).  It is so well done that it really deserves to be reprinted.	2005-02-28

It just sounded trite and boring to me.  But I finally caved and got it.  What a surprise that it was just loads of fun.  Yes, it was grisly (after all, we are talking Frankenstein here), but it had Mr. Koontz's usual good pacing and story telling, believable characters, etc.  I look forward to the next installment, which I will certainly not resist reading!	2005-02-28

A few sentences made me cringe thinking of my own lifestyle.  Yes, I like latte; yes, I like social justice.  Oh my gosh!  I may be a bobo!  Very funny, actually.  People who are offended by it may be taking it too seriously (taking oneself too seriously is also perhaps a bobo trait).  It certainly made me take a hard look at my own silly purchasing habits.  Actually, I really worried when I realized that I didn't find ~$15,000 for a slate shower (as he mentioned) offensive.  So this is a lot of fun.	2005-02-27

Beautifully written, beautifully translated, this is one of the best books of the second half of the twentieth century.  This is the story of a young Italian woman and her sons, mostly during World War II.  The beautiful portrait of the young baby, and then young boy, was just so moving.  And I loved the descriptions of their dog, Bella.  As she looked at each of her puppies, she thought it was surely the most beautiful one in the world.  Morante captured the essence of motherhood.  Of course, life has tragedy, and this is a very, very sad book.  But if you want a good story, and marvelous writing, writing that is so beautiful that you are just stunned, then read this book.	2005-02-25

The thing is, everybody loves Disney.  It is like speaking heresy during the inquisition to say that Disney may not be perfect!  And, assuming that the author's stories are true, it is sorta fun to see the great organization given some grief for its relentless building and \\"never explain, never apologize\\" philosophy.<br /><br />The thing is, when I and my friends went to Disneyland as children, I just hated the place.  And I felt so \\"in the closet\\" on the issue.  I mean, no kid admits to hating Disneyland!  But it seemed so crass/crowded/overblown to me.  And then, when I saw the movie \\"The Shaggy Dog,\\" I was just blown away by the incredible lack of ethics I saw (note the reaction of the heroine when it turns out her father is the villain).  After that, I was always suspicious that Disney might not have our best interests at heart -- that, God forbid, its goal might be simply to make a profit.  So, OK, that really isn't a bad goal for a corporation....  But neither does it mean that their stuff is so perfect.  So, I liked the book.  Perhaps Mr. Hiasen and I are the only two Americans to feel this way -- but I believe he is correct.  Very amusing reading.	2005-02-25

I found it very disturbing, even evil, in parts -- and being a tolerant person, I don't say that lightly.  Mr. Shirley was constrained, I suppose, by the facts of the film, so I won't blame him for it.  But don't read this, or see the film, unless it doesn't bother you to SPOILER WARNING READ NO FURTHER IF YOU CARE ABOUT NOT KNOWING THE END:  that the angel Gabriel was responsible for much of the evil, and the world is saved in the end by Satan.

It tells in detail the founding of the US/New York branch in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  I was very disappointed, however, in that I thought it would be a sort of spiritual reading book, also.  It is not.  This is history -- land purchases, bank note debts, fairs to raise money, community elections, politics, etc.  If one didn't know, you could say this wasn't about a religious group at all.  But as history, it is very interesting and worthwhile.  So I gave it 5 stars just for that.  If a beautiful exposition of the bringing of carmelite spirituality to the USA is what you are looking for, this isn't it, however.	2005-02-14

Athos.  It was the 25th anniversary of his profession among the Cistercians, and he felt a need to take some time to examine his progress and whether or not there was too much activity in his life.  This book chronicles the several months he stayed at<br /><br />Athos, and is also a great look at the monks, themselves, as met and observed by a western monk.  Fr. Basil's humility, willingness to put himself last, gentleness in the face of a few rude anticatholic monks is quite moving.  And the faith and goodness of the vast majority of monks he met was just so edifying and wonderful.  I found this book to be excellent both as from a spiritual standpoint, and as a quick look at some of the differences and between the Eastern and Western church.  I hadn't realized how different some of the beliefs are, or how angry some of the East is (perhaps rightly so, in some cases).  So I found this book very enlightening.  I recommend it to anyone with an interest in Mt. Athos, spiritual seeking, prayer.	2005-02-09

Athos.  This information includes both the physical history along with the spiritual history (a sort of metahistory, so to speak).  The author includes information on the various spiritual movements (hesychasts, etc) that have originated  on this peninsula that, while located in northern modern Greece, is actually a sort of autonomous republic.  Especially interesting is the information on the unexpected, amazing renewal that is taking place there.  30 years ago, the end of Mt. Athos was in sight.  Now, new monks come and the monasteries are again flourishing.  Amazing.  Also interesting is the information on Mt. Athos's place in the EU, and what that membership may mean to the monks.  At any rate, this is a first rate book of interest to anyone who is interested in christian spirituality in general, and orthodox spirituality in particular.	2005-02-08

If he didn't, why does so much minor evidence, added up, all point to him?  He has her lipstick in his car (he gave a ride to a group of kids earlier in the summer), he was spotted near where she works, etc, etc.  That is all interesting, well presented.  But what really makes this story so good is the interior monolog that he keeps going.  And his conversation with his wife.  His concern about language/philosophy -- exactness in an era of inexact living.  This is a well written book.  I recommend it.	2005-02-07

Gruber spent among the Coptic monasteries of Egypt is fascinating.  Fr. Gruber lovingly describes these men and their piety, along with the phenomenal faith of the Coptic lay people.  There appears to be a direct line back to the conferences of John Cassian in the lives of these monks, but that perhaps is because Fr. Gruber has crafted the chapters in such a way to invite the comparison.  But maybe not.  These men live lives of remarkable holiness.  I loved the image of people grabbing them by the ankle and holding on till the monk will bless them.  I also loved the hike in 130 degree heat, and realization that the cave he has been brought to, and in which he spends the next three days, probably saves his life, in that it is much cooler than the monastery, nothing is swimming in the drinking water, etc.  At any rate, I highly recommend this book.  I do agree with the review that states this treats more of his exterior life than interior, but why should he discuss his private life with us.  Also, there is another book (can't recall the author) called \\"Coptic Nuns\\" that makes a nice companion to this book, in terms of knowing more about the culture.	2005-02-07

The basic problem -- how to save the earth as the sun begins to act strangely and giant rings appear on the earth -- which will apparently propel the earth to a new star system.  From there, we get to plots that are 65 million years old, quantum manipulation, teams of lemurs and dinosaurs in flying astroids, debates on free will -- you name it, it is in this book.  The love interest?  The love between family members and friends.  This is really a great, challenging book.  If you like hard science fiction, then read it.	2005-01-31

I never much care, on a personal level, for his characters.  They are always morally compromised, it seems to me.  But I do like how he writes about them.  I thought the chase was excellently drawn.  The only quibble?  I thought the character, Rudolph, was going to have a bigger role.  I was sorry that wasn't true.

If it seems there are a lot of clichees, remember that this book was so well done that it actually started the whole genre of person on the run from shady corporate? government? people.  The protagonist is a law student who accidentally stumbles upon the solution to a crime (assassination of supreme court judges).  Someone is trying to silence her.  The entire story is her running, the people who are trying to help her, and the people who are trying to kill her.  Not bad.	2005-01-24

I just didn't much, however.  The plot idea, the killing of a twin, and then the other twin taking over her life, sounded like an interesting mystery idea.  But in reality, the characters seemed really 2 dimensional -- totally unbelievable.  This might be a good summer holiday book, however, if you don't expect too much.

US	51336578	R3JTDEVQJFELQF	0312283407	796405359	Rescuing Jeffrey: A Memoir	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Outstanding	This is a finely written memoir of a dreadful event -- a swimming accident that left the author's teenaged son paralyzed.  The story takes us over the first days after the accident -- a time when the parents are trying to balance their son's options -- and the possibility of terminating life support.  This is a very moving book, and I could not help but be profoundly impressed by the son, Jeffrey, along with his family and the network of supportive friends.  I recommend this book without reservation.  On another, perhaps less important note, I should mention that the author is also a very good writer.  It is frequent in memoir books that I overlook style because of the content.  But in this case, the content was very moving, as I said;  the writing was very, very good. One last comment -- I cannot help but wonder if the negative reviewers finished the book.  They might be surprised.	2005-01-18

The graphic novel MAUS is a good proof.  Now, I have found another one in this fine work by David B.  Epileptic is the life story, actually, of the author/artist, and his family as they go through the profoundly moving events surrounding David's older brother's epilepsy.  I must say that the casual cruelty to which this child was subjected by the community was shocking.  While it is true that that is the basic core around which the story develops, it is also about David's coming to grips with his own personal fears and demons, along with his development as an artist.  It was interesting to see how much quackery his family was subjected to -- the desperate parents who love their son so much that they try anything at all that seems to offer hope.  At any rate, I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the subject, and also anyone who is interested in outstanding graphic work.	2005-01-10

This is truly a universal story, on one level, the story of undying love, a real soap opera with two girls competing for one boy.

It was so funny and so full of those poignant little truisms about human nature.  The basic story:  Tepper likes to sit in his car and read the paper with time on the meter in New York City.  Of course, people want him to move it so they can have the space.  Does he just like to read?  Or does he recall the days of his youth when his skill at finding a good parking place was a great pleasure for him (before he caved and bought a place in a parking garage)?  Folks begin to line up to sit in his car for a few minutes with him and get his advice on problems.  All of this infuriates a fascist mayor.

These hapless regulars live in a trailer park in Novia Scotia -- every day they try to find a way to retire from crime -- usually by scoring the biggest drug deal they can think of!  They drive down the road in a car with no door, balancing rum and coke on the dashboard.  In a strange way, you just have to love them for being so totally clueless.  There is a kind of innocence to them.  I recommend this series to anyone with a strong stomach for language (tho on BBC-TV, the words are bleeped out -- which actually has a neat effect of every other word being bleep).  Filmed in a \\"documentary\\" style, it is worth every penny of the price.	2005-01-03

I don't think that was exactly the case here -- everyone seems to have loved Leonie -- but there is a definite feeling that she was considered, and must have felt, inferior to her siblings.  Her four sisters all became Carmelite nuns in Lisieux, and one (Therese, of course) has been canonized and declared a doctor of the Church.  Poor Leonie found her way in a different order as a nun of the Visitation after 3 tries.  It appears, however, that she followed St. Therese's \\"Little Way\\" more exactly than the others, and may indeed finally be the second saint in the family (unless her parents - also being considered - are canonized first).  I would like to read more about her, but perhaps there just isn't any other information.  Has anyone collected her letters?  It would be interesting to see how she grew spiritually by reading all of her correspondence, not just selections.  At any rate, this is a nice book and I recommend it to anyone who desires to follow the little way.	2005-01-03

It doesn't do the book justice to say that it is a contemporary retelling of the story of Tobias from the Old Testament.  This book was so elegantly written (at least in the English translation, which I am assuming was probably still not as good as the original French) that I was just stunned.  I read portions to my family who were as enthralled by the beautiful descriptions as I was.  The basic story is a history of a family from the perspective of Deborah, a young Jewish woman who loses everyone she loves, one by one, to disaster.  Over her long life, God is silent, but she is still faithful.  Of course, anyone who has read the original bible story knows that an angel, Raphael, assists the family -- and how beautifully that is portrayed in the book.  I recommend this book without reservation and look forward to reading Ms. Germain's books.	2005-01-03

He has almost no routine ties with anyone, and discovers that only he and one other person live in his apartment building.  There is a real sense of alienation -- aloneness -- in this book.  Even when he is out in public, you feel that he might as well be in a universe of shadows.  One day he goes back to visit his old neighborhood and discovers a nice, friendly couple who look like his parents did when they were alive.  He is now 47, but this couple appear to be in their early 30's, just as he remembers his parents.  He is very moved to find people that look so much like them, and begins to visit these people.  The story goes from there.  I had actually guessed the \\"surprise\\" denoument, but it was still well done.  This book was not as \\"frightening\\" as it might have been, but succeeded very well in creating a sense of distance and coldness in this world.  I recommend it for a cold evening by the fireplace, when the wind is blowing outside, and you want a story that is quite moody.	2004-11-22

I gave it 5 stars because I didn't want to ruin its rating, when it is evidently so beloved by every other reviewer.  It was really only worth 1 or 2 stars.  I read this because of its high rating,but didn't find it the equal of, say, just about any other science fiction book.  Having said that -- I did get a real laugh out of the first few chapters.  The street gang vs the aliens was definitely amusing.  But once that was done....<br /><br />I do think the authors are good at describing people.

US	51336578	R11V1CSXV9EFUC	0451192583	284706036	The Ignored	Books	3	2	2	N	Y	An interesting concept	The idea of a person being so average and ignored by everyone isn't original with Bentley Little, but he does a good job of taking it to different places.  This is a story about a man who is ignored by everyone, who finally realizes that he is literally a different kind of human being.  I don't want to give away the storyline (in horror lit at least some surprises need to be left untold), but as we follow the development of Bob Jones, it did seem to me that the story wobbled in lots of different directions, as though the author couldn't decide whether Bob should be a fundamentally decent person (who nonetheless commits murder), or whatever.  I suppose we are supposed to see Bob as conflicted.  Instead, I saw him as wishy washy -- but I guess that is perhaps what a terminally average person might be.  I also found it impossible to see why Bob would still like the character he witnesses ritually murdering children!  Good grief!  Are we to assume that Bob simply cannot feel a strong repugnance?  He feels it about the rapes committed by his \\"friends,\\" and he feels strong emotions towards his girlfriend.  I found the end unsatisfying.	2004-11-18

I guess it shouldn't be surprising since he has long been appreciated as a fine writer and performer.  I work in a rehab center library and can honestly say that this book has received enormous praise among both people with MS and their friends and family.  On a personal level, I found the story very moving.  I can't imagine how difficult it must be to come to grips with MS, and to come out publicly with it while working in an industry that is not overly kind to physical problems.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants a greater understanding of living with MS.  But also, on another level, this is a great story about how a talented man initially broke into show business.  I am glad to see that he is still working.	2004-11-18

I did not, however, find it to be the \\"great\\" book it was supposed to be.  Having said that, it was an enormously enjoyable piece of escapism, and I can highly recommend it as such.  The writing is excellent -- actually beautiful in some places.  I imagine we will see some fine future books by Grossman.  I, too, found the ending to be a bit abrupt -- and the computer game did seem a bit off subject.  But I actually think both the end, and the game, play an integral part in the story.  I don't want to say too much, because I don't want to spoil this lovely story about the search for a missing 14th century manuscript.  It is a fantastic mystery.  For the sake of argument with those who objected, however, I will say this (and hopefully it will only make sense to those people, and will not give away the story):  Think about disposability -- and think about easter eggs.  It really does connect with the entire story.<br /><br />I do recommend this book.	2004-11-15

I agree with the reviewer who said this book was long-winded and lurid...and I just loved the book. Reading it was like being dunked in a pot of fudge -- so rich that it is really just too much. The story opens in 1945, but is set in a Barcelona that is just recovering from the loss of moral bearings during the Spanish Civil War.  I loved this story about a boy who goes to the cemetery of forgotten books and becomes obsessed with finding out the history of the book he has chosen there, and why someone with the name of a character from the book is trying to burn all existing copies.  I loved the sad love story, I loved the desperate friendship that the characters showed for one another.  I especially loved the character, Fermin, the rehabilitated old communist, street bum, torture victim; everything he had to say was a joy to read.  The one thing I didn't care for, or understand, was the murderous obsession of one of the characters.  We are asked to believe that so much is set in motion because of one man's unexplained evil. Unfortunately,that is what is really asked of us.  I don't want to give away any of the book's end (and it certainly demanded a suspension of disbelief -- and a belief that fate and coincidence have a place in good books), but if you enjoy spooky, lurid, full-blown tales about lost books and doomed love, etc, then you will enjoy this.  It somehow misses being a \\"great book,\\" but is certainly a very, very enjoyable one.	2004-11-06

While there is lots of good, primary source information about the convent itself, in many ways the convent history is a springboard to larger issues of the day -- various class and gender issues, along with a general look at Milan, church politics, etc.  I found it particularly interesting because I have always viewed the Tridentine enclosure as a positive, freeing act for the nuns.  This book, however, has a slightly different, though quite fairly and well delineated take on it.<br /><br />I should also comment that the book seemed especially well written to me.  The author has a good command of words and I look forward to any future work she may produce.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of the period, in general, and gender or Church history in particular.	2004-10-26

This is just the second book by her that I have read and I am just delighted.  It is true, as one reviewer stated, that she maintains a certain distance from her characters, but that allows them to be less predictable, and a greater level of irony can also then by limned.  This small novel about an alienated, sad \\"Monday reviewer\\" of books in Stockholm, orphaned, who believes he is the son of a murdered Jewish Pole who wrote surrealistic material is a lovely (but sad) story of self definition, inspiration, success/failure, trust.  I recommend it strongly to anyone who loves good writing.	2004-10-24

That said, it is a beautifully written, very poignant story of a young girl's murder, yes, but even more about the effect that crime has on her family.  The narrative voice is that of the girl from \\"heaven\\" or the \\"afterlife,\\" as she recalls her life and watches as life moves on for those left behind.  To be honest, I found the end a bit facile and silly, but still, overall, I would recommend this book to any serious reader.	2004-09-30

I had no expectations of it being even mildly interesting.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered a story that transcended \\"good yarn,\\" making the leap into \\"mythic.\\"  A unique story, wonderfully told.  The basic storyline, that people have learned to live in the \\"instant,\\" constantly battling for control of the outcome of history, is a fun concept -- but what I found much more interesting was the way the author would try to convey that even movement in the instant, time passed, etc, was simpy an illusion that we creatures originating in time kept trying to impress upon the \\"instant.\\"  And the way people are described -- defined by timelengths as attributes --  well, I won't say anymore, other than that this is a highly imaginative book -- worth a read for anyone that loves science fiction or fantasy.	2004-09-23

I loved the metaphor of the endless loop around Ft. Worth.  This character is a person that, in another poorer writer's hands, would have been a serial killer -- hopeless, disaffected.  But here he is a good person, just looking for meaning.  Even more excellent than the story, however, is the author's use of language.  What beautiful writing.  The only person I can compare him with is Portis at his best.  At any rate, read this book if you want a wonderful, life affirming book that can be appreciated on so many levels!	2004-08-25

I reread it many times over the years, and my husband and I read it outloud while camping when we were young.  Sooo romantic! So, it was with much sadness that, after a break of about 15 years, I tried again and found that it now seemed sadly out of date and old fashioned.  Oh well.  Still, there may be some souls out there who find this wonderful story, full of sweep, journeying from the channel islands to New Zealand, from youth to old age, from cluelessness to profound enlightenment, quite nice.  One of the nicest things about this book was that it led me to find the little book Marguerite is given by the nuns, and that book changed my life, too.  Happy reading!!	2004-08-10

It is predictable; it covers no new territory in the world of political mystery/thriller.  But who cares?  If you want Dostoevsky, read Dostoevsky!  This book delivered exactly what it promised -- a rolicking good story full of suspense.  This story would make a fine action movie, actually, with the opening sequence of Ben and Danielle infiltrating the compound of a homegrown American group of fanatics, the fine touch of Ben's family's involvement, to the surprise about Danielle's family.  I thought it was a fine summer day's read.  I recommend this book to anyone who has a few hours to spend at the beach reading.	2004-08-08

Other reviewers have discussed the plot, so I won't go into that. I will just say that I am one of the folks who read every edition printed &quot;under the sign of the unicorn&quot; in the now legendary series published by Ballantine in the '60s and '70s. I have enjoyed fantasy from Machen to MacDonald to contemporaries like Powers, Blaylock, and Melville. But this book is so good that it enters into the pantheon of those few greats that actually seem to be numenous in themselves. This book is unforgettable. This story of worlds within worlds and the imprint of architypes is a must read for anyone who loves fantasy, or just really good books!	2004-08-02

This book is a well written mystery about a San Francisco police officer tracking down a serial killer while simultaneously keeping a crazed colleague from head bashing hippies, because, yes, it is set during the *summer of love,* 1967.

He obviously has a 5-star talent.  But this book is not so much scarey as truly creepy -- and not in a nice way.  This book is just ugly.  And the pictures were even uglier.  Think of the emotional reaction to something really sad and sick -- like maybe chronic skin infection exhudate, and that is my reaction to this story.  E-e-e-w-h!  If that is what you like, then the rating should be 5-star.  But if you want a nice day with nice images in your brain, then avoid this book.	2004-07-12

She captures the wide array of different kinds of \\"religious life,\\" from very traditional cloister (Passionists) to something that can only loosely be defined as \\"catholic\\" (IHM community) with all the different places in between.  She presents a loving and honest look at each group she describes, but doesn't flinch from anything she sees as a negative.  Actually, I thought she was pretty hard on folks who weren't so welcoming to her -- repeating the comment that the IHM traditionalists were \\"warped old women\\" was cruel, I thought).  But, all in all, I found this book fascinating.  As one of the 100,000 or so convent women who didn't survive the '60s, it was a real pleasure to read a book that presented such a straightforward, and genuinely human, look at the sisters and their work.  I was especially moved by the chapters on the birthing clinic and the raw poverty of the folks who were served by the clinic.  This was truly beautiful writing.	2004-03-25

It is as if Thomas Pynchon and Philip K. Dick got together...no, it is better than that!!  How come nobody knows about this???  This should be considered a classic!  I thought Kandel's book, \\"Panda Ray\\" was great, but I am more excited about this book than any I can remember.  Imagine a world where the garbage strike is more worrisome than the Russian invasion; where lawns come to life and devour people; where, when you die, you can still die again, going to different levels of death; a world where spacey doped up kids, really are \\"spacey,\\" using the drugs supplied by Captain Jack Zodiac to travel the universe; a world where daughters get emmeshed in window shopping so that they turn into \\"mall zombies.\\" A world where, like in P. K. Dick's books, suddenly you know that you just aren't in Kansas anymore.  All this, with the added extra of an extremely witty and charming style.  But enough!  I don't want to give it all away.

Rather reminds me of a wonderful book I read years ago about the lost continent of Mu....  Maybe everything in the book is true -- but I am not sure who Mr. Callahan is?  Is he just writing opinions, or is he a scholar in the field??  I couldn't tell...  Absolutely zero credentials were listed.  For all I know, he is a street cleaner (no shame there) with interesting opinions, but no training in judging legitimacy of sources.  All of that would be OK, but since the book is put out by the Skeptic Soc, I believe that it is reasonable to be a little skeptical.  Right??

But I, too, at first approached this book warily -- willing to read it because I enjoy Hanson's other books.  But I have no interest whatsoever in an anti-hispanic book....If I had to be described in a few too easy words, they would be that I am profoundly liberal and sympathetic to the immigrants.  However, this book turned out not to be anti-immigrant -- really the opposite.  Dr. Hanson takes a good look at the problems of multiculturism (and we all know what those are, now, don't we?  We all know the term \\"Balkanism\\"), and the situation where there exists a large infrastructure of folks with a vested interest in maintaining a hostile sense of \\"otherness\\" among immigrants. In the end, both the immigrants and American society as a whole suffer.  Dr. Hanson proposes some solutions which sound reasonable.  Why did we ever turn from the model of folks coming from many cultures (still treasuring old memories), yet assimilating into one great American culture?  Yes, there was injustice at times.  Tell me there isn't now!  But the important thing was that it was not usually institutionalized injustice...just stupid individuals.  This is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it.	2003-09-13

Stories within stories. . . symbols that turn out to be reality and reality that turns out to be symbols -- yikes!  Don't read this unless you can handle a trip at least 5 and 1/2 minutes into your own psyche.  Madness abounds.  This is a haunted house story like none other (though the aftertaste is rather like \\"House on the Borderland\\").  And I thought my heart would break for Johnny Truant.

I cannot believe the vitriol some folks lob at the author.  Serious lack of charity involved, it seems to me.  I found the book to be interesting and definitely a worthwhile examination of why, with all its faults, the Catholic Church still provides a spiritual home for the author.  I trust folks who believe it is possible to question and doubt and still affirm faith.  For those who are afraid ever to examine or doubt, one wonders what it is they fear. . . perhaps their faith isn't as strong as they believe.  But this author is not afraid.

The delimma that is mentioned in the book re the sorts of treatment, surgical vs drugs vs talk, has led to much discussion in my family.  I will say, however, finally, that I did kind of guess the end before I was a dozen pages in.

In the &quot;Franny&quot; portion, you will recall that she repeats a prayer over and over, and consults a little book.  At the time, I asked my lit teacher what the book was and was told it didn't exist .. it was just part of the story.  Many, many years later, I heard about the Way of the Pilgrim, and putting 2 and 2 together, realized that this is what Salinger referred to.  I then read Way of the Pilgrim, just to see the literary reference, and instead found a beautiful book that renewed my spiritual life.  This is a simple story of a 19th century Russian wanderer, his attempts to follow St. Paul's admonition to pray without ceasing.  This is a marvelous story.

I have no idea if the movie would stand the test of time.  I understand it was withdrawn from distribution and can no longer be seen.  But at the time, I thought it was fantastic!  The story of the gunslinger (as metophor for seeker of truth) fighting the other masters in the desert -- the strange cavern full of mutants -- all of it must be seen to be believed!  A group of us went back and saw this film over and over again.  I still don't know what it all meant, with its strange amalgam of sufism, buddhism, etc, but I wouldn't mind seeing it again. ADDENDUM: Well, I did see it again recently, and found it very difficult to watch.  I assume those butchered animals were actually killed for the movie.  It was interesting, but didn't work for me anymore.  Boohoo!	2002-11-19

It is probably only interesting to the fan of Philip K. Dick.  Having said that, it really is fun, in its own way.  All the Dickian issues are there:  What is the nature of reality; do we really know what is going on; the man caught in the middle of realities in flux; the wife/girlfriend as super unsupporting person, etc.  If you want to read all of PKD's stuff, find this and read it.  Otherwise, it is only marginally interesting.	2002-11-19

This is a story of a very repressive society (read cold war, McCarthy-era USA)and a man who breaks out of the pattern.

The only word for this movie is &quot;brilliant.&quot;  I got a feeling for how alien and strange the ancient civilization must have been.  Usually, in presentations of the classics, everything just seems like present day folks wearing costumes -- but not this film.  Filmed in North Africa, it just blew me and my family away!  If you like the classics, you will love this movie.  Having said that, of course it has the usual Pasolini eccentricities.  Be forewarned.	2002-11-18

Very bulky looking to begin with, but it all sort of evaporated by the end.  Having said that, it was a quick and fun read with a clever premise.  A secret organization with shadowing ties in the past to urban legend types of mind control research has kept this research alive and is using it to program assassins.  Oh this is fun and presented well.  I could hardly wait to turn the page and find out what would happen next.  Thus, I was able to overlook a few big holes in the plot.  Having said that, this was a fun read that I would recommend to anyone who needs something to kill a few vacation or airport hours.	2002-11-18

I bought this book because I am interested in the early history of book publishing. I had never heard of Michael Servetus and found his story fascinating. What a brilliant man. And what an unlucky man!! How could anyone be so smart and so stupid at the same time? He managed to figure out how blood circulates before anyone else, and then buries this info in a treatise against the belief in the trinity! Most of his books were destroyed (along with him), but a few managed to survive. The story of that survival is also fascinating. The biggest question I had, and it is one that no one can answer, is why when Servetus managed to get away from the inquisition did he run to Geneva, where his bitter enemy Calvin was waiting to burn him?? Just about the only thing the Catholic church and Calvin agreed on was that Servetus should die. This book is, thus, also about a time with attitudes that are incomprehensible to most of us....a time when people wanted to murder others for not believing the same. No one seemed to honor freedom of conscience! So, this book was very interesting, told me about someone I had not heard of, and described a very tense time in the history of western religion. I highly recommend it.	2002-11-18

I loved this story about a future in which the expolorers are all slightly deformed, so that they won't be missed when they die.  A ridiculous premise, of course!  But it makes for a wonderful group of characters.  And I loved the thought of universe in which anyone who kills another is labelled \\"nonsensient\\" and can no longer travel.

It is amusing to see the personality switches (the author clearly thinks gender determines certain traits).  As the hour in which the current crop of young people nears in which they must commit to one gender or the other or both (neutral or &quot;neut&quot;), female and male traits slip in and out of the hero's mind.  At one point, he is interested in someone blathering on and realizes he must be affected by his female side or he wouldn't find all this talk of any interest.  I found it all very amusing.  I have enjoyed all of his books and look forward to reading the newest.	2002-11-15

The author's premise, that AIDS is manmade, the world is just full of conspiracies to keep the truth from us, etc, is simply not supported by any evidence.  And his comment that AIDS can be transmitted by such contact as handling the sheets of patients, or by insects such as mosquitoes and bed bugs, just isn't true.  If mosquitoes could spread AIDS, every person in the USA South would now be infected.<br />This book is a cruel, poorly presented, lie that uses the suffering of people in order to make money for the author, in my opinion.	2002-11-15

This is a great adventure yarn based on the historical defense of Greece by Sparta at Thermopylae.  It was extremely well done, and the author was able to convey the Spartan spirit very well.

This fine book tells the story of two young men, boys really, who are sent to the countryside for &quot;re-education&quot; during the Chinese cultural revolution.  Vivid, evocative story-telling at its best, the book is almost impossible to put down.  I read it in one sitting -- unable to stop!  I was reminded somewhat of Zola's naturalism, what with the descriptions of carrying excrement up the mountain.  And what could top the scene where the village headman demands that one of the boys perform a root canal procedure on him, because the boy's father is a dentist?  Ouch!  The description of the sewing machine/drill, and the slimy, yellow tongue of the headman was just so well done! And the end of the book -- what a surprise, and how perfect it was. I would be amazed if this writer doesn't become one of the greats!  This is novel writing at its best!	2002-11-11

The story of these trappists who died in Algeria in 1996 is a remarkable one that is told very well by the author.  It is rare that such a sad event, the kidnapping and decapitation of these good, harmless men can generate such a feeling of hope and optimism.  I lost a lot of my prejudices against Muslims reading this book.  What a good and hospitable people most of the folk were.  I cannot ever forget the reaction of the imams, refusing to condone such a murder, and even suffering death themselves rather than issue fetwas against innocent people.  What a wonderful witness to the gospels these men showed.  They were good neighbors who didn't deserve this kind of death.  But none of the muslim victims of these terrorists deserved it either.  The death of the monks brought attention to all the nameless people who had already died.  And finally, I cannot read Christian de Cherge's final testiment without crying at the beauty of it:  The forgiveness, the fraternal love shown even to his murderer.  I will pray with brother Christian that, as he said, one day he and his murderer will meet with forgiveness before God, two good thieves.<br />Read this book!	2002-11-10

In this one, a promising young associate with a powerful law firm in DC is among a group of fellow lawyers taken hostage by a homeless man.  This incident propels the protagonist into the seeing the plight of the poor.  It is certainly predictable that he quits the firm, who has unwittingly allowed a terrible injustice to occur.  The rest of the book, which I won't reveal, is about the wrangle between the firm and the lawyer.  It got a little tiresome in places; I felt the book could lose many, many pages!  But it was an OK read by a solid performer.  It filled up a rainy holiday.	2002-11-03

I have not been disappointed.  The story of 12-year old Harriet's search for the killer of her brother, Robin (a murder that happened when Harriet was only 6 weeks old) is richly presented, with so many wonderfully drawn characters.  I, too, laughed till I almost cried and the snake scene.  And even though the Ratliff brothers are truly American gothic-deliverance sorts, the author even made one feel a sort of pity for them.  Grandmother \\"Gum\\" was just awful.  The sense that these people were constantly told by her not to be above themselves, that her daddy used to say that he couldn't imagine why a grown man would sit down with a book, that a college scholarship was just a setup for a downfall and humiliation. . . this was a manipulative, evil woman.  And the descriptions of her grandsons, flying very high on amphetamines is both sad, awful, and very, very funny.  I wanted Danny to escape, somehow, to something better. (I am assuming, too, that he was the \\"little friend\\" of Robin.) And poor Eugene, who found \\"salvation\\" was just so pathetically unable to be a preacher.  I did not care for Harriet, as a person.  I don't like people who behave like her.  But the character, and that of Hely, her friend, was well described.  I loved Harriet's grandmother and aunts.  Perfect almost to stereotypic little old southern ladies, yet it didn't feel like a cliche at all.<br />At any rate, this novel was truly absorbing, and I loved it.  More, please, Ms. Tartt!	2002-11-03

I mean, these are dead people on display.  Who wants to be looked at like that.  I felt so rude.  And yet. . . I could not discard the book.  It is clearly also very moving, and is also a book of clear artistry.  So, if you have a strong stomach, along with compassion for these people (especially the room of children dead for centuries!), look at this book.  Otherwise, maybe best to not get.

I wish there were a little more scholarly info, however.  Celine always seemed especially interesting to me.  She had many opportunities:  a marriage proposal, a proposal to found an active order in Canada, apparently a strong talent in art and photography.  Yet these don't really shine through in this book.  Conversely, her sanctity didn't come through either, for me.  Still, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves reading the details about Therese's family.  I would love to see a good book about her sisters Pauline and Marie, also.

I believe the author was an artist in the school of the fantastic or fantasmic in the early 20th century.  His only work of literature, this book is truly one of the strangest pieces I have ever read.  I was initially introduced to it by my college German prof who had a love for this kind of apochryphal lit, and passed on that love to me.  I have since read this many, many times.  I don't want to give too much away, but the basic story has a young man and his wife invited to live in a newly founded realm in Asia.  This realm has been founded by an old school chum, Patera, whose concept is that only things that enhance moods can be permitted into the country, and these things should usually be old and have a kind of emotional evocative power, so to speak.  The young couple find themselves in a realm of moods, both depression and manic, and it is a very strange trip, indeed.  I recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have a compulsive need for analytical, linear reason in a book!	2002-10-29

I first read it many years ago, in another edition, and it scared me so much I have never been able to forget it.  This book is haunting and troubling.  I agree with the reviewer that it is better not to reveal too much of the story; the story must be read and information given bit by bit to make this story effective.  But I did have a slightly different interpretation.  When I originally read it, I couldn't decide if it was all &quot;real&quot; or if the writer was suffering from a psychotic break.  I guess it doesn't matter in terms of a good story.  At any rate, anyone who enjoys a really good scarey book should read this one!	2002-10-29

There are thousands of other Carmelites, some VERY liberal, some VERY conservative.Finally, the alhambra carmelites were founded from St. Louis and Mother Baptista from Ireland in 1913 (I think). They are the cloistered Carmelites.The carmelites the author wrote about are active sisters.  They are not in any way cloistered, except in a sense of conservative lifestyle.  But this is supposed to be scholarship! Use the words correctly! Otherwise, a very very interesting book.	2002-10-17

The plot is extremely imaginative, with lots of strange twists. It is also rather dark (believe me, no one wants a mother like the one in this story!!). Imagine an alien family here on earth, having very alien values, with all that implies. Imagine a race and chase through space and time and alternate realities, all written in a sort of dry, \\"postmodern\\" sort of way, as the protagonist tries to get away from a very strict mom, who has a unique way of punishing her chidren.  This book is wonderful science fiction/literary candy.  Having said all that, any one that really loves science fiction or fantasy should read this.<br /><br />Addendum added years later:  After 7 years, I still believe this is one of the best science fiction books I've ever read (and I've read hundreds over the years -- maybe thousands -- in the 50 years I've been reading them!).  I have reread it many times.  After reading the other reviews, I think the problem is that some folks may bring a different set of expectations (valid in their own way)to books.  I personally don't have to have everything linear (tho I generally prefer it).  This is science fiction/fantasy for people who love words for themselves, and enjoy a new twist or two.  It is extremely imaginative, you care about the characters, and it isn't just like everything else you've ever read.  Give it a chance!	2002-09-11

It is a glance into the lives of 3 women, Hanna Arendt, Simone Weil, and Edith Stein, each of Jewish descent and, in particular, at the response each one made to Nazism.  There is a review of each woman's life and her career.  A lot of space is given to the education of these women, which is especially interesting since each studied under some of the biggest names in philosophy in the 20th century.  It is not easy to follow, however, unless you have some basic knowledge of Heidegger, Jaspers, Alain, Husserl.  But it is still interesting.  Each of these women chose a different response (not just to nazism, but to the world, actually).  Arendt became strongly Zionist, and an author of wonderful books; Simone Weil, strangely at odds with her heritage, but whose essays are marvels of clarity, chose a strange path of starvation (whatever the philosophical underpinnings, one wonders about anorexia); Edith Stein converted to Catholicism and became a Carmelite nun, devoting her life to prayer (though still writing).  Each of these responses is fascinating in its own right.  I highly recommend this difficult, but rewarding book.	2002-07-10

Well, the descriptions are still great, and I see no plot defects now!!  Each book has just gotten better.  Usually, a series gets a little tired after this many books, but not so with these.  I am not going to go into an analysis of the plot, which can be gotten better elsewhere.  I would simply recommend this book.  My biggest fear is that now that several romantic threads are tied up, Hambly may end the series.  Please, no!!  And while I love Benjamin, I wouldn't mind learning more about Hannibal Sefton, Abishag Shaw, or even to see a mystery from Benjamin's voodoo queen sister's point of view.  That might be a lot of fun, too!!  At any rate, if you want a fun read, check out this series!  But start with the first book and read them all!	2002-07-10

I agree with the first reviewer that any time spiritual practice (in any faith) is separated from psychological realities, trouble will result. I disagree with the reviewers who didn't like the author's style. I thought it was very well done. The use of all the double negatives did, at times, get annoying, but somehow it fit the subject matter. I guess you could say that Zen is not not about nothing (sorry Mr. Downing). Finally, though, I felt a real sadness for all the folks that saw a lot of their hopes dashed in the fact of the evidence of the abbot's human fraility (the BMW, artwork, best friend's wife, etc). But I couldn't help but agree with the Japanese who said that when students and abbots disagree, students leave, not the abbot. There was a lot of criticism of Baker's acquisitiveness, but he left, didn't he. The criticizing students couldn't give up their Zen Center. Having said that, I thought the book was just fascinating. I bought it from a discount table, and I am sorry that the book hasn't done better, in regards to sales, because it deserves to.	2002-06-20

This is a very literate and witty author.  It may take an English or Fine Arts major to catch all the jokes, but even if you miss a lot of them, it is still both a good mystery and a great sci fi.  I actually burst into laughter at the thought of militant Baconians, subversive abstract expressionists, and furtively whispered suspicions about Shakespeare and Marlowe.  What a howl!  I loved it.	2002-04-22

It sounded intriguing to me, so I began a very long and exhaustive search for the truth.  What I found was that the \\"truth\\" really isn't there.  Lots of opinions over time are, however.  These somehow get sanctified by time, and then quoted as evidence!  In fact, maybe Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married, maybe they weren't. . . there is no real way to know.  Bottom line:  it really isn't important one way or the other.  The important thing is what He taught.	2001-10-10

I noticed that there was a strange neglect to mention all the work that sisters have done in hospital/nursing.  It is good to see a book that gives us a good description of this and other work.  It is amazing to see these women working against such adversity, and achieving so much.  Our usual image of 19th century women does not include administrators and CEOs, but that is what these women were.  They served God and their fellow humans in remarkable ways.  It made me nastalgic for the days of plentiful vocations.	2001-09-17

The authors searched through monastic archives and found beautiful works ranging from plays to poetry to biography written by nuns and lovingly preserved by their sisters through the centuries.

At the time, the book had a powerful formative effect. As I recall, it was extremely moving, but its most profound impact was not in the detail, but in a sort of metaphysical reaction to the story as a whole. As time past, and I thought I had learned all my lessons, &quot;grown up,&quot; (though at times I would recall the character F as, like him, I would hum Great Pretender). So I really didn't give this sort of thing a thought any longer. But now, it seems to me again that Cohen has something to teach about the lessons that maybe I didn't actually complete as well as I thought. I would like to hear more about his life in his zen retreat. I'm glad this book is back.	2001-09-01

I loved this book. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I usually reserve that for, say, Dostoevsky and the really great ones. Once I started this story of 3 young people just starting college, their meetings with magicians, angels, and an ancient secret society, not to mention the sleeping moon goddess, I could not put this book down. I read it straight through till I finished at 3am. And the next morning, I ran out and bought her other books. This book is perfect example of great urban fantasy. Having said all that, I believe the author's fine detail work with her characters should be mentioned also. Read this book!	2001-08-29

But our experiences were entirely different.  I hope no one thinks all orders were like hers!  I guess I must have been in a house entirely populated by nuns like Armstrong's saintly and brilliant Mother Bianca!  I did not stay either, but am honest enough with myself to see that 1) I hadn't a vocation, and 2) everything I did was my own choice.  Why would anyone stay in a place with a Mother Walter?  And why would her order put someone like that in charge?  I would be interested in hearing that nun's rebuttal.  Having said all that, I did enjoy the book.  Armstrong is simply one of the best writers on religious subjects.  I am sorry she has no faith herself any longer.	2001-08-18

Yet, it has haunted me.  Its putrid plot has risen to the top of my list of appalling books.  And yet, somehow, it has generated enough opinion to merit over 50 reviews!! That is more than some of Iris Murdoch's wonderful books.  And it has garnered some really high ratings.  5 stars!  Amazing.  That would put it on a par with War and Peace.  Golly!  I stand in awe of the public's taste.

I thought &quot;The Stress of Her Regard&quot; and &quot;Anubis Gates&quot; were incredibly original and imaginative, but his newest book, &quot;Declare,&quot; was even better.  Mr. Powers combines cold war espionage, ancient lore, real incidents (the Kim Philby story)to form a truly gripping story.  What is most amazing is that it all holds together and seems plausible!

So many books are called &quot;new classics,&quot; but it is really true in this case.  Every step of the way was magical and unpredictable.  I have only one small quibble with the author.  I was saddened by the statement that &quot;Christianity is a lie; a beautiful, strong lie, but a lie, nonetheless.&quot;  Unfortunately, not all parents are broadminded enough to allow the &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; that a fantasy calls for, and thus many children will not be given access to this fine book.  However, it is true that CS Lewis certainly felt free to be strongly pro-Christian in his fantasies;clearly Mr. Pullman has the right to feel otherwise.	2000-10-19

The basic plot is that Sr. John, a contemplative nun, has deep experiences of God and writes beautiful poetry about it.  She then discovers that there may be a biological basis for her experiences.  The dilemma is:  Should she keep the illness and her experiences, or give them up and face dryness and ordinariness.  In so many ways, this book is true to the Carmelite experience.  How does the author know all these details that are so true?	2000-09-21

It has cardboard characters, and was pretty bad.  However, I must say, I did read it to the  end in one sitting, and what more can you ask of an author?  I might even  be willing to give the author another try.  I was orginally going to say  the plot was predictable, but who could imagine a catholic church full of  cold blooded killer priests and an actual inquisitional torture chamber  (with blacksmith type torturer, even!).  Why would they have such a place?   &quot;To keep in practice&quot; as the priests say in the book!  I fault  the editor, however, more than the author, who is fairly new at the  business.  All it would have taken was a stress on this group being a  separatist, crazy faction, and it would have been more believable, and less  crude.<br />But, hey, if you want a couple of hours of adventure reading, with  an interesting premise, it is worth that.	2000-08-16

This marvelous story of  shapeshifters of the southwest, manitous of the north, and Celtic genii  loci is truly wonderful.  Read this book! And, Mr. de Lint, was it  serendipidous, or did you know about wise older women and spiders in some  of the Plains Tribes?  That is fairly esoteric, I think (I got it from my  granny).
