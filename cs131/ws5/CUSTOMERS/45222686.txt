I loved this story about two moms that use to be the best of friends, then one day Sarah McDowell, had borrowed Mary Sutton's antique tea service and never returned it, It was stolen and Mary never forgave Sarah for it, they stopped talking for twenty years. Sarah's daughter Noelle and Mary son Thom, were high school sweethearts. They were going to meet at the park and elope, Noelle thinking that Thom had stood her up and Thom thinking that Noelle stood him up Noelle leaves and moves away, it has been ten years and she is finally coming home for her sister's wedding. She has to face Thom and what happen 10 years ago, she is hoping she can put this all behind her. In order for Sarah to book the hall for her daughters wedding she has to help with the Christmas Baskets and she has to work a long side with Mary, they both made me laugh so much, whenever they got together, both being  stubborn and neither of them moving an inch to become friends again, sometimes it makes you think when you have had a friend who was your best friend at one time and something has become between you to and you feel that you can never get that friendship back, but if the friendship is worth it then it's worth saving.<br />  Happy Reading Lisa	2002-11-19
