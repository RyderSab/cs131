Davie has produced a first-rate collection of news and feature stories, along with his own expert commentary on what went into crafting these award-winning works of journalism. <br />I especially enjoyed the story on a man named Malcolm who turned to lipsuction because he'd tried everything and couldn't get rid of his love handles. The lead sentence: \\"The problem hit Malcolm in the middle.\\"  <br />I'd recommend this book to journalism students, practicing reporters and anyone who enjoys reading finely crafted news and feature articles.	2005-01-26

I quite enjoyed this funny and informative tongue-in-cheek critique of Dubya and company. Of course it can't match the unintentional humour of the Republican National Convention or the great debates in which Bush shone in all his simplicity. For a more serious, international perspective, I'd also highly recommend Bushwhacked by Michael B. Davie (ISBN: 0973195614) as a good companion book offering a wealth of information. And let's put all this information and perspective to good use: I think \\"former president George W. Bush\\" has a nice ring to it.	2004-10-04

Davie breaks free of that mindset with an uplifting, thought-provoking and inspiring look at a future rich with opportunity. <BR>Upbeat stories on how billionaires such as Ron Joyce of Tim Hortons fame and Mike DeGroote of Laidlaw fame fill the pages of this business oriented coffee table book. Their stories and success tips are truly educational and enlightening. <BR>Enterprise 2000 is a well-written, terrific book that also features a lot of superb photography. <BR>It's also a message of encouragement and a challenge to the rest of us to get off our butts and achieve great things.	2004-02-25

Davie is one of the most unusual and inspiring books you're ever likely to come across.<br />Unusual because the book combines most aspects of a business book with a coffee table book that's heavy on both pictures and text.<br />Inspiring because much of the content concerns the life stories of highly successful people who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps to become rich and influential.<br />Of particular interest is the story of Michael G. DeGroote who immigrated to Canada as a child, barely spoke any English, dropped out of school at age 14 and landed his first job - hauling manure to Southern Ontario tobacco farms. From these humble beginnings, DeGroote went on to acquire and build Laidlaw into a multi-billion-dollar giant, then sold his shares to move to Bermuda and begin a new empire in the sun. All in all, a very inspiring, thought-provoking book. Highly recommended.	2004-02-19

Davie is a truly fascinating book with a wealth of detailed information on Quebec separatism.<BR>The author looks at the Canadian province of Quebec's separation movement in terms of its impact on all Canadians, French and English alike.<BR>What he finds isn't pretty: Did you know the Quebec government has made it illegal for anyone in that province to display signs in English, unless the French translation appears above it in lettering twice as large? Merchants in business for centuries have had to change their signs to French to appease petty, spiteful politicians, a direct attack on freedom of expression.<BR>And that's just the tip of the iceberg. The Parti Quebecois government openly promotes separation from Canada - if that isn't treason, I don't know what is. The government also likes to dictate what language (French) your children are schooled in and generally goes out of its way to belittle English, the language of the vast majority of people in Canada. This book is a timely eye-opener. I highly recommend it.	2004-02-16

Davie.<BR>However, this slender book could have gone further in providing examples of some of the exemplary award-winning work this veteran journalist has produced for The Hamilton Spectator and The Toronto Star among other major Canadian newspapers.<BR>I'd also like to see Davie expand on his insightful comments concerning the stories behind the featured articles. Perhaps future volumes will address these points and will include more of this journalist's advice on creating award-winning news and feature articles. That said, this is still a very good book that provides a welcome sampling of the work of one of Canada's finest journalists.	2004-01-29

She also offers at-times humorous accounts of her own experiences on these trails and gives you a pretty good idea of what to expect in the way of sights and sounds. All in all, it's an invaluable companion for any weekend hiker. Highly recommended.	2004-01-29

I love the powerful female lead character Arian and her sidekicks, Don-zee and Donal. The plot is full of interesting twists and turns. Basically, if you like Lord Of The Rings, you'll love this book. The Curse fills the void with a great new fantasy story. I can't wait for the remaining books.	2004-01-29

But this book is about as politically incorrect as they come. And it's funny. Very funny. <BR>I didn't want to find it funny however. I'd like to think I'm too sophisticated to relate to some of the book's toilet humour.<BR>But there was no escaping this relentless assault on the funny bone and I was really annoyed that I kept laughing out loud as I read it. I'd have to recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to have a good laugh, even if it is at someone else's expense.	2004-01-28

Well my friend, many of us lived that life and we make no apologies. I don't think any of us regret cutting loose before joining the corporate world. The Late Man by Michael B. Davie explores that free age through the eyes of a tragic central character. Yet for all Jay's turmoil, I can only conclude that when it comes to enjoying true freedom, however fleetingly, it's better 'Late' than never. The novel also has very well developed characters and a fascinating plot.	2003-10-08

Davie, follows one young man's descent into madness after a drug overdose in an isolated cabin in Ontario's north country. We then follow this same young man after he escapes into a world that has changed dramatically, a world he cannot identify or cope with. This is one of the best novels I've read in years.

Creep is anything but. In fact, it's quite depressing in places. The central character is deeply disturbed and I do hope Creep is truly a novel and not the autobiography of some sicko. That said, Creep is an interesting and provocative book, well worth a read.	2003-08-26

Davie, especially the section relating the story of Michael G. DeGroote, an impovished public school dropout who left Belgium for Canada in his early teens, with barely a word of English.<BR>Over the course of an impressively entrepreneurial career, DeGroote built Laidlaw into a behemoth - and then moved to Bermuda to build a new empire there.

One gets the sense that the dying author is seizing every day and living every moment to the fullest, ever-conscious of her own mortality.

Davie is the fact this book presents a different side of politics. Most political science books tend to focus on those in power, the decision-makers and ruling classes. But Davie takes an intimate look at the fringe dwellers and their sometimes frustrating efforts to exert an influence on the policy process. This is a superb book, offering an unusual perspective.

These stories are often framed with the argument that the provincial governments are one level closer to the people and are somehow more capable of delivering the service in question in a cost-efficient manner.<BR>But these stories tend to be one-sided affairs. Missing is the impact on the federal government and Canada as a whole.<BR>In Canada Decentralized, author Michael B. Davie undertakes a thorough examination of the cumulative affect of years of shifting powers away from the central government.<BR>And what Davie finds isn't pretty: He makes a convincing argument that many years of decentralization have denuded the central federal government of many of its former powers while seriously eroding the government's ability to function on the world stage and present a united voice on behalf of all Canadians. This is a serious wakeup call for anyone who believes Ottawa should simply give the provinces whatever they ask for.	2003-07-30

The result is a book that takes an analytical approach and pulls no punches in offering an unbiased viewpoint.<br />Another strength of Inside The Witches' Coven is that it's thoroughly researched, weaving historical information in with the goings-on of a modern day coven. Well-written and well-presented, this is a first-rate book on a little-known counter-culture.	2003-06-25
