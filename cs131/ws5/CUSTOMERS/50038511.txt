And it's not written perfectly. And it's got a little bit of corny dialouge. But I thought this was a fairly entertaining story.<br />Looking at the previous customer reviews, I have come to the conclusion that you either love this book, or you hate it... there doesn't seem to be much middle ground. To be fair, I must say that, yes, this IS your standard fantasy story with the unsuspecting hero, a jaded wizard, the beautiful but powerful woman and a pretty two-dimensional antagonist with magic powers. Face it: There's not a whole lot of original ideas out there, people. <br />Let's look at what's good about this book: It's pacing is superb... there's not a dull spot in the book. The background characters are interesting, even if they don't have a whole lot of dialouge or time in the spotlight. The story, while not above recycling some of the standard fantasy plot lines, does have interesting and new things in it. The Mord-Sith (now there's a Star Wars name rip-off if I ever saw one!)  were fascinating to me, as was the whole idea of the Confessors. <br />The bottom line is, this is an entertaining, fun, not too heavy book to read. It's thick, so it'll last a little while, but it's not so thick in actual content that you feel like you need a break after a reading session. Fantasy pros will recognize a lot of old cliches, but newcomers to the genre will probably be absolutely enthralled. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story, fantasy expert, or someone who doesn't know anything about wizards and magic. <br />One thing to say in closing: How people can like Zelanzy's Amber Chronicles and not enjoy this story is totally beyond me. Amber was so dull, so insanely written, and most ridiculous concept for a story I have EVER come across. Pick up the Sword of Truth... avoid Amber.	2002-05-30

I actually JUST finished reading it and rushed right over to write my review. What an amazing book!  <br />My first Terry Brooks novel was the Episode 1 novelization. I was so pleased with the way this adaptation turned out, I made it a point to explore the Shannara novels which I had heard so many wonderful things about. (I started with First King. Big mistake. DO NOT start with that one!) <br />There ARE similarities to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, but I didn't feel it was a rip-off. (Really, if you think about it, there are only so many basic plot lines that can be done, and let's face it, no one is going to be totally original anymore.) Brooks' style and usage of descriptive words pull you right in, making you feel like you're part of the story, rather than being thick, overly descriptive, and hard to get into. I really can't get over Brooks' talent. He is a master story-teller, one of the best modern day novelists I've ever come across. The story takes unexpected twists and turns and should keep ANY reader hooked until the end, despite the over 700 pages. The characters are wonderful, and believable, each one will find a place in your heart in no time, as you see them mature and grow throughout the entire tale. <br />The book isn't without flaws, though. I was unimpressed with the Warlock Lord, especially the end. He failed to impress upon me that 'love-to-hate-bad-guy' feeling that makes any villain great. I felt he and the battle fell a little flat, especially after six hundred and some pages of build-up. Same with the war at Tyrsis. All this build up, and then, bang. It's done. Not major problems, and they really were the only slightly negative side of an otherwise perfect book.<br />I can't recommed this book enough!! Anyone who is looking for a terrific read should get their hands on this book any way you can! It's a page-turner, almost impossible to put down. You'll fly through it, despite the 725 pages. I mean, I finished this in a week, it's that good!! Read it, read it, READ IT! You will not be disappointed!	2001-08-10

It is full of great color photos from all three Original films, and I especially loved the behind the scenes shots.

With a title like, &quot;Jedi Search&quot; you'd think that would be the main focus, but Anderson spends much time on Kyp Durron and Han Solo on Kessel. It's interesting enough, and you can see why anyone would not want to be exiled there. Characters are written well: new characters are great, old characters remain true to the past. However...<br />Anderson's style is a bit patronizing. It seems as if this is a book written for kids, and the plot is very predictible. Plus, I always wonder WHY we have to keep having a superweapon in every story? Not only is there a new planet destroying weapon, but there's ANOTHER Death Star, which will see action further in the trilogy. It was bad enough that there was a second in Jedi, but now we have to have a third? Anderson seems a bit short on creativity and subtlety. And why must we have all those references to the just AWFUL comic books about the resurrected Emperor and Luke's apprenticeship to him? The comic books were bad enough, but to tie it in with the novels, all I can say is why?<br />This book is filled with more bad than good, but there's enough here to keep a devoted fan reading 'til the end.	2000-10-03

The chapters on this topic are short, and few. Too much time is spent on Leia and her diplomatic struggles, and Jacen and Jaina. While these are intersting enough, I read this to find out about the Jedi, not about two-year-olds running around quoting their favorite story. Daala went from bad in the first book, to worse with this one. When first desribed as a military genius, and then depicted the way she is in this, I must wonder about Anderson's continuity. I liked Exar Kun's involvemnet in the story, although he gets quite awful by the next book. I just couldn't figure out why Luke couldn't sense his presence. Luke seems rather cut off from his students and the things they are doing, and it gets him into trouble. Another superweapon was a little tiresome. Plus a third Death Star, need I say more? Anderson's style is childish, but easy to understand. Characters like Qwi and Furgan are explored a little more, and are quite intersting.<br />Overall, not an awful book, but it's nowhere near being good. People starting their first explorations into the world of SW novels would be wise to start with better options such as the Thrawn trilogy.	2000-10-03

He tries to destroy the body by the most ridiculous measures, instead of just incinerating it like Gantoris's. The whole situation was resolved way too early, and the focus was moved to more boring plot lines. Kyp was punished in no way for the death to billions he caused because he was 'possessed' by Exar Kun. The last I checked, you chose to go to the dark side and all actions made by you were your own choice, not because someone took control of you. Another Death Star, another lame plot line. Anderson's style is childish, and quite predictible. He leaves absloultely nothing for you to figure out yourself.<br />A good library loan for even serious SW fans.	2000-10-03

Beautiful and informative.<br />I bought it originally for the incredible artwork, but I was pleasantly surprised to find lots of great information on some of the worlds in Star Wars. The text is written by Kevin J. Anderson, but he did a pretty good job on this book.<br />Still, the crowning glory of this book is the collection of astounding artwork by Ralph McQuarrie. Lots of full-page color paintings with remarkable detail. McQuarrie is the king of SW art, and this is him at his best! <br />This is a must have for any Star Wars fan, or even one of great artwork, and would make a great present for any Star Wars fan.	2000-09-29

Surely, the Emperor would've sensed their presence in the Force. And they beat a buch of Jedi, including Yoda? I think not. Riding rancors? Well, at least we know they're good for something, but, I just had a hard time seeing that.<br />Leia, Leia, Leia. The first time some rich, handsome prince comes along, she totally forgets Han. I mean, how many times did he save her? Did she completely forget that &quot;I love you!&quot;, &quot;I know.&quot; thing? She is written totally out of character.<br />Luke, oh what can I say about his character? I think writers have a hard time wirting him, but I've never seen anyone do as bad a job as Wolverton did. <br />Zsinj, if you haven't read the X-Wing books, is a character with no depth or personality. I would reccommend reading the X-Wing books first, so you get an idea about who he is.<br />I found great interst in Isolder and Teneniel. They were well written and quite interesting. They had depth, and were totally believeable. <br />Not a bad book, but just a little on the unbelievable side. I found it enjoyable, and it was kind of fun to read. The pacing is good and the style is really easy to get into. Just don't expect too much out of this book, and you'll get along fine.	2000-09-28

This book is better than the other two, mostly because it's the last one, and after this the trilogy is all over!<br />Jeter just can't seem to drop the excessive words included in each book. Finally things start to make sense, but why did it take so long?! Characters are still written badly, too much time is spent on what they are thinking, and it's filled with big, unnecessary words. Dialouge takes forever to get through because we have to make sure we know what everybody thinks before moving on to the next sentence. <br />Probably the only slightly interesting thing in the story is Neelah's outcome. Everything else is pointless and boring. The pace is slow, and the style is terrible. The events in these books are irrelevant to the struggle between the Alliance and the Empire, so they really don't hold much interest to fans.<br />Unless you are a HUGE Boba Fett fan, skip this book. Serious fans, such as myself will get no enjoyment out of this series unless they like Fett (a lot!). If you just MUST read it, borrow it from the library or a friend, as it is not worth 6 bucks.	2000-09-28

I found it a little difficult to come off of Bacta War to an entirely new set of characters. It's almost like starting over and I was a little biased going into it. Then, as I started to read, I warmed up to it, and in fact, I almost like Allston's books better than the X-Wing books written by Stackpole.<br />This book has a lot less space action in it, but it's no less exciting than the rest. The new characters are written very well, and I found myself getting attached to them. Situations are believabe and not outrageous like the whole Lusankya thing. One of the things about this book that I especially liked, was the presence of humor. I totally loved Face and Phanan; they brought something much needed to the series. The previous four books are so serious and have hardly any humor in them at all. This book, while serious, has lots of sarcastic remarks, and just plain humorous moments in it, something the others were lacking in. The plot is a little thin, but that's because the main task of this book is to get you introduced to the characters. I had a hard time believing that a Gamorrean could pilot an X-Wing, genetically tampered with or not. Perhaps I'm a little something of a bigot, but I didn't especially like all the aliens as pilots. Still a minor detail when compared to the rest of the postive things about it.<br />Allston's style is easy to get into, and he paces his story just right.<br />All in all this is a great book, but some may not like it. Don't read this thinking it's going to be another story like the previous, because it's totally and completely different from the first four, yet still highly enjoyable.<br />Reccommended to any Star Wars fan, or of a great action book.	2000-09-28

It takes the characters from Wraith Squadron and sheds a whole new light on them. <br />The thing I appreciate about Allston's books is the presence of humor. By using this, he creates very lifelike people, and the storyline doesn't get quite as depressing as in some books. Characters have real problems and work together to get through them, vs. the shiny perfect pilots who can do no wrong of Rogue Squadron. His pacing is great; the story is easy to understand and get into, and it's almost impossible to put down. There's not as much space action going on, but that's fine since some of those dogfights are a little hard to follow. Allston includes lots of alien pilots, something I don't especially like, but it's not a big problem. Definately read Wraith Squadron first, it provides important information needed to grasp the story in Iron Fist.<br />Overall an incredible book! Very realistic and enjoyable.<br />Reccommended to any Star Wars fan or one of great action stories.	2000-09-28

I really can't understand why Stackpole wrote another X-Wing book. Why do we need to have another story about the Rogues? The Bacta War was a good enough ending, and this book just seemed to be a rehash of previous plots.<br />I had a few problems with this book. The plot is really thin, low on character development, and reuses ideas we've already read about. How often does Mirax need to think that Corran is dead? Plus, the addition of Ysanne Isard's clone was just terrible. It seems like Stackpole decided at the last minute to write another X-Wing book, and couldn't come up with any new ideas. It's disappointing, because his other 4 books were great. He also can't seem to decide if he wants Iella and Wedge to get together. Slow, and uneventful. I loved the ending, however. <br />If you've read all the other X-Wing books to this point, go ahead and read this one, if you must. I would reccommend borrowing it from the library, as it's not good enough to spend six dollars on.	2000-09-28

It was slow, wordy, and the plot was a little thin, if not confusing.<br />The author spends way too much time inside the characters' heads. It often takes an entire chapter for just two characters to have a conversation. There's too much description on unimportant details, and the same expressions are used over and over and over. Fett escaping from the Sarlacc pit was just bad. Just leave him dead! Besides, wouldn't Fett blowing the Sarlacc up from the inside out blow him up too? Neelah was really annoying and served no purpose in the story. Dengar was pathetic, and Fett was written badly. Then, all the jumping around from 'Now' to 'Then' was bad. It interrupted the flow of the story, if it had a flow at all. It served no purpose in the entire scheme of things, and readers would do better to read books like the Han Solo Trilogy, Thrawn Trilogy, or the X-Wing series. <br />Unless you like Boba Fett A LOT, I would suggest you skip this book entirely, or if you just HAVE to read it, borrow it from your library or a friend, don't waste your money.	2000-09-28

Excellent, probably the best of Allston's X-Wing books.<br />This is high-action and drama filled! Lots of suspensful situations and interesting plot twists. I love the way Allston wirtes his characters. He does an incredible job of presenting life-like characters with great personalities. He did a great job with Han Solo. Some authors find it hard to write him, but Allston hit it right on the mark when doing Han. The members of Rogue Squadron are present, but the main focus is on the Wraiths. Lots of humor and a halarious chapter involving an Ewok puppett! Allston's pacing and writing style are right on!

This book was better than the first, however it's still boring! Characters are written badly, and there's way too much time spent inside their heads. It's like the author doesn't trust readers to pick up on things for themselves, so everything is spelled out. The flow, if you could call it that, is interrupted by wordy descriptions, most of which contain large and unnecessary words. What is meant to be exciting plot twists are boring and confusing. I think if a different author had taken this project on it could have become quite wonderful, but the style of Jeter is terrible. It's hard to get into and hard to understand. There's way to many character views to keep track of, not to mention the jumping from 'Now' to 'Then'. <br />Even a serious Star Wars fan, such as myself, can find little enjoyment in this Trilogy. Unless you are a HUGE fan of Boba Fett, I'd reccommend skipping this book, or borrowing it from your library or a friend. It's definately not worth spending your money on.	2000-09-28

Situations were  written extremely well also, and the story flows very nicely. I'm also  pleased with the direction of Corran Horn. <br />I had a few problems with  this book, though. In the end battle for Thyferra, I would've liked to see  more ground action. If Stackpole is going to include a ground battle along  with the space battle, he should describe both in equal amounts.  Unfortunately, I thought there was far too much description of things  happening in space that didn't need to be there. There's lots of character  perspecitve and I got lost a few times. I also think that Stackpole threw  everything he'd laid down about Isard out the window. No longer was she  cunning and intellegent, but she was cocky and stupid. She just didn't seem  to be the same character. And the fact that Bror Jace didn't die after all?  It seems to me that the 'Impossible is what Rogues do best' phrase has been  overdone. Jace didn't serve a significant role and was better off being a  casuality.<br />As just one book, I didn't like it, but since it's included in  a series that seems to just all run together as one book, it was okay. The  only reason I read this book at all was because I'd read the others. A good  one for fans of the series or for people who have read the  others.<br />Recommended.	2000-08-10

This was one of the best,  as the battle sequences are few and most of the story focus is on the  characters. Since the plots kind of melt into one another, this series is  kind of like one huge book.<br />Stackpole writes his characters very well,  and the more you read the more comfortable you get with the absence of  Luke, Han and Leia. <br />While the other books have had believable  situations, I found the Lusankya prison to be a little far-fetched, even  for sci-fi, much like the ysalamiri in the Thrawn Trilogy. While it does  provide a thrilling situation for Corran's escape, when it was finally  revealed what and where it was I was a bit disappointed. I felt that  Stackpole went too far overboard and ruined the whole Lusankya line.<br />This  book has lots of plot twists, all of which I found entertaining, and  believable. With all the wild cards thrown into the mix, I was left  guessing throughout the enire book. It's got quite a bit of action,  however, I found the trial to be a bit drawn out and boring at times.<br />I  recommend this to all fans of action and Star Wars, but a word of caution:  be sure to read the other two books in this series before moving on to this  one. They provide the needed background necessary to understand the  plot.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-08-07

While  Corran is still the main focus, more of the Squad is explored, especially  Gavin Darklighter. <br />Since the Squad is sent to Coruscant undercover to  help win it from the Empire, there's a lot of cloak and dagger action along  with the flying. There's a few chases present, and more than once I was  holding my breath in anticipation. With the involvement of a spy in Rogue  Squadron I found myself just dying to know who it was, and Iceheart has a  few surprises in store for the members of Rogue Squadron and the Rebellion.  There's a cliff-hanger ending and I had to start on the next book right  away.<br />Stackpole does a great job, but like the first, I found some of the  battle scenes a little hard to follow. Other than that there was no  problems with the book.<br />If you liked the first X-Wing book, you'll love  this one even more! A much deeper plot, and it leaves you just begging for  more. A defintate read for any Star Wars fan or of a great action  book.<br />Highly reccommended.	2000-08-06

Han, Luke, or Leia are not present in this book, but Wedge  Antilles is a main character. Corran Horn is the main focus, but all of  Rogue Squadron is explored. New characters are written believably and are  put in realistic situations.<br />The lack of main charcters from the movies,  especially Luke, pushes the story in new directions. Personally, I would've  liked to see a breif appearance by Luke or Han, but that in no way takes  away from this book. Lots of battles and flying only the Rogues could  preform.<br />The story is fast-paced, but even with Stackpole's excellent  descriptions, I found a few of the battle scenes to be a little hard to  follow. The plot isn't that deep, but like I said before, it's really just  introducing the characters and getting you used to them before getting more  in depth with the next installments. There's a little politics present, but  it's written well and stays away from the boring.<br />The further involvment  of a woman in the Empire was refreshing. I especially liked the main  antagonist, Ysanne &quot;Iceheart&quot; Isard. Ruthless and very  intellegent, I like to think of her as a female version of Thrawn. Kirtan  Loor, an Intellegence officer has a personal connection with Horn, and he  seeks revenge. Both these villians were well written, believable and very  enjoyable.<br />Definatley read this first if you are wanting to read the  entire X-Wing series. I reccommend this to all fans of Star Wars or of a  great action book. It starts right out, and it's really easy to get into.  Stackpole's style is quite easy to understand without being too redundant.  A wonderful book, I found it hard to put down once I started.	2000-08-06

Dev was one of my faves, and I was almost as upset as Luke was  at the end. The Ssi-ruu are interesting, and downright evil. I loved them!  Tyers' interaction between new and old characters is great, shedding light  on a new side of Luke Skywalker, and Leia finally comes to terms with her  lineage.<br />The beginning is a little slow, and there's quite a bit of  politics involved in the middle, but the end battle is exciting.

It's exciting from beginning to end, and there's not a dull moment in the entire story. <br />The characters  are nicely written, believable and interesting, and Perry remains true to  the original characters' personalities.<br />The book kind of re-hashes the  basic story plots from the movies, however. Leia gets herself captured  again, and Luke has to put himself on the line to save her. And the typical  space battles are included: Rebels vs. Imperials.<br />The inclusion of a new  villain is very welcome. Xizor is a great baddie, even decides to go  against Vader and the Emperor. We also get into Vader's more emotional and  personal side. You can see his inner struggle when dealing with Luke, and  he even disapproves of the Emperor at times.<br />A great book overall, it  fills in a lot of gaps and answers lots of questions about the time period  between Empire and Jedi. Very good read for any fan of Star Wars, or of a  great action book.	2000-07-25

I've memorized every line, every move, every detail. Yet, as I read this book I was hanging on Glut's every word! He has a great writing style, the plot is fast-paced, it grabs you  and won't let go. There's more here than in the movie as well. Luke gets  some lightsaber training while on Dagobah, and that fabled kiss on Clud  City, it's here as well! A must-have for the Star Wars fan and book  collector!	2000-07-19

I enjoyed getting deep into Anakin's mind and feelings, and seeing the darker side that was not shown in Phantom Menace. However, Obi-Wan was very poorly written. He is boring, tedious and just  plain un-interesting. <br />As for the plot, it concentrates way too much on  Sekotan shipbuilding rituals. Native cultures should be used as  enhancments, not as the base for a story. The conflict isn't qutie as good  as it could be. The &quot;bad guys&quot; and the &quot;good guys&quot;  plans clumsily come together, and the end is, also, clumsy.<br />I also can't  quite figure out Rath Sienar's role in this story. If Tarkin was going to  interrupt the mission, then why did he send Sienar in the first place? Or  what was Vergere's role in the whole thing? <br />The book does offer some  interesting points, though. Along with getting into Anakin's character a  little more as I have stated, the Jedi Council sees a little more action  here, and Mace Windu's character is deepend.<br />The book had great  potential, but I was disappointed. Read it if you must, but if you skip it,  you're not missing a whole lot.	2000-07-15

For those that have seen the film, this book adds a lot of character development and background. Being able to &quot;get into a character's mind&quot; is very helpful in understanding what is really  going on. It's easy to get into, and Brooks' style is easy to understand  and follow.<br />It also adds a lot of things not seen in the film. Anakin has  a close encounter with a Tusken Raider, and the story starts with the  Podrace briefly mentioned in the film where he wrecks Watto's pod.<br />A  definate must-read for fans of Star Wars, this is not just a movie put into  words, rather it's an expansion on what Lucas has given us visually.	2000-07-15
US	50038511	R2J7CCENY2P1LF	0345400771	660403930	Star Wars	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Wonderfully written, but basically a re-hash of the film	We're all familiar with the story, why read the book? That's what a lot of people ask, and I must say there's really not that many reasons to. Everything presented here is in the film, except for a few exceptions. We  meet Luke a little earlier into the story, and he has a talk with his  friend, Biggs Darklighter. Other than that, there's not a whole lot here  that you can't see in the films.<br />However, as a book, it is most  excellently written. The writing style is easy to get into and understand,  and characters are written believably. A must-have for the Star Wars book  collecter, a good choice of a library loan for anyone else.	2000-07-15

This book offers insight to Han's young life, answers questions we've all had about Han for years, and delivers a fast-paced, interesting story at the same time. The new characters we meet along the way are believable,  intersting, and add much more variety to the Star Wars Universe. Han is the  only character featured we've seen before, but he's true blue, and  completely accurate. Definately a must-read for any Star Wars fan.	2000-07-14

I read this book as fast as my eyes and fingers would allow me! Zahn delivers an exciting and fast-paced story with the characters we've all grown to know and love and adds some new ones.

Following the events in Paradise Snare, this is about Han and Chewie's early relationship, his employment with Jabba the Hutt, and our favorite dashing young gambler, Lando Calrissian. Every  character present is interesting and exciting while remaining true to what  has been laid down in the films. If you've ever had any questions about  Han's early life, read this trilogy.	2000-07-14

Foster does a tremendous job of writing for only having ANH to go on. I especially liked Luke in this book. Foster matured him, made him more of a man. No longer is he a whiney  farmboy, but a heroic escort of Princess Leia. His only thoughts are of  protecting her, and his other new friends he meets along the way. However,  I did find Leia to be just awful. Forster totally misinterpretted her  character and made her a whimpy, bossy pain. While the plot isn't  incredibley exciting, it's just enough to keep you interested.	2000-07-14

I got a huge disappointment. These are just awful books! The plots were boring, the  characters were boring, the writing was slow, and there just isn't anything  very interesting at all with these selections. In fact, if I hadn't vowed  to read all the Star Wars novels, I never would've finished them. Don't  waste your time, or your money.	2000-07-14

This book is the perfect ending for Han's young life, and a perfect setup for A New Hope. It ties in just right with the events we see in the movies, and answers some of the questions we fans have asked ourselves about the  young Han Solo. It has exciting new characters while keeping in sync with  the old from the films. The plot is fast-paced and exciting, and if you  ever wondered about those spies responsible for beaming the Death Star  plans to the Tantive IV, well, that'll be answered as well. A must-read for  Star Wars fans.	2000-07-14

A wonderful place to start the Expanded Universe readings, although, some people might find it helpful to read the series' leading up to this one(the X-Wing series and the Courtship of Princess  Leia) to fill in the gaps such as Leia being pregnant, etc. The one problem  I had with this book was the ysalamiri. A creature able to push back the  Force, just so Luke can be put in an impossible situation without his  powers. Other than that it was great. I was on the edge of my seat, and  couldn't put it down. A must-read for any Star Wars fan.	2000-02-18

Finding out how the movie was made and all the work that went into it, astounded me. Lots of nitty-gritty details and interviews with George Lucas, Rick McCallum,  and other members of the crew and cast. The behind the scene pictures were  also very intersting.
