But this one is kind of different because it concentrates mainly on the weapons (including cannons and armored ships) used in the war.  In this case there's quite a bit of fascinating info packed into a small book, one that is easy to read but also detailed.	2004-12-24

It keeps going off on annoying tangents, with long paragraphs giving way too much detail about the heroine's everyday life at the bakery where she works. It still gets 5 stars in my book, though, simply for the beauty of the core story, which is still resonating in my mind several weeks after reading it. I didn't want it to end!  Robin McKinley somehow has the ability to connect with readers on a subconscious emotional level, in the manner of folk tales and legends. I feel that her book Deerskin is one of the best books I have ever read.	2004-07-08

His \\"Life in Ancient Athens\\", \\"Age of Augustus\\", and more recent single volume \\"Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman Mythology\\" are, despite their brevity and young adult reading level, on a par with many of the best scholarly works written for adults. This one on Roman slavery covers the subject in amazing detail for such a small book, and the writing is lively and the text meticulously documented throughout. In addition, the bibliography is large and highly useful. A first-rate job all the way around.	2002-07-12

The author covers the subject thoroughly and accurately. Unfortunately, though the book does have footnotes, they do have page numbers, which seems extremely odd. I thumbed through two other volumes by the same author and their notes did have page numbers, as they are supposed to. The reason for this is a mystery, however the book is well worth the read if you are interested in Caesar and his career.	2002-07-12

This is the best brief study of HAMLET I have ever seen, and I have seen many in almost five decades of reading about the Bard. Students will benefit immensely from the author's ability to convey a huge quantity of facts about a long, complicated play without boring, confusing, or talking down to them. The plot, characters, themes, and much more are covered with care, attention to detail, and enthusiasm, revealing what must be a life-long love of Shakespeare. Indeed, Nardo, a historian by trade, and quite a good one by the way, seems equally at home in the world of Shakespearean criticism, which turns out to be fortunate for all the rest of us! So, I say \\"get thee to a library\\" and take out this marvelous little book!	2002-07-12

I've read a great deal about Julius Caesar, including some pretty scholarly stuff, but I've never read a better short summary of the man's life and exploits. In a very small amount of space the author provides a large amount of detail and includes numerous quotes by ancient writers, including Caesar himself,a feature usually not seen in children's books about history.  The writing is so good it realy makes the title character come to life.  Good job.	2002-06-27

It doesn't come right out and endorse the faith, as many books do, neither does it criticize it, but instead it presents the known facts and leaves it up to the reader to judge for himself. I was impressed by the amount of detail and documentation in a small book written for high school students. I'm also amazed all the time by how many Christians have no idea about the history of their own faith and urge them to read this book to get an easy-to-digest overview.	2002-06-27

This is not one of those silly bios of flamboyant pro wrestlers published to exploit teenaged mat fans. Rather, it tells, in considerable detail and in lively, readable prose, the entire history of the sport, from the ancient Egyptians and Greeks to the courts of medieval kings to frontier America to the modern day, including both the amateur and professional versions. Important historical figures are profiled, and appropriate space is given to true greats of the sport, such as Frank Gotch and Dan Gable. The way the author traces the transition from real to fake wrestling in the pro ranks in the early decades of the twentieth century is masterful and fascinating. The only fault I can find with the book is the cover photo, which shows two outdated, unknown, and very ugly pro wrestlers in an unflattering pose. Otherwise, I highly recommend the book to all wrestling fans and anyone who like sports.	2002-06-27

Like everybody, I saw Roots on TV and was very moved.  So I was pretty surprised when many years later reading this book moved me again.  It was very well written.  But is was also very disturbing because it tells it like it really was, when in colonial days the colonists were taking black people from Africa and bringing them here by force.  There are a lot of interesting and again disturbing statistics in the book about the numbers of slaves involved in the slave trade and so forth.  The book doesn't cover the Civil War and all that, though.  So you'll have to get that stuff from a different book.	2001-02-24

For high school or college students doing research on ancient Greece, or for anyone interested in the ancient Greeks in general, this is an extremely comprehensive, well-organized, and useful book!  It starts off with a general overview of ancient Greek civilization written by the editor, Don Nardo, who is a noted authority on the subject.  Then there are dozens of articles witten by other well-known historians, each covering some aspect of Greek history or life.  There's information on democracy and and how it came about, about Greek literature, about Greek theater, which started in Athens, about commerce and trade, and weapons and war, and lots more.  In the back of the book are short biographies of important people and gods and Greek places, and a huge!! glossary, and best of all a really huge bibliography, that gives the reader plenty of ideas about where to go for more information (though it seems to me that only scholars would need to look furhter than this book).  The price is kind of high, but students should be able to find the book in a nearby library.  It will be well worth the effort!	2001-02-24

It starts out with an excellent introduction in which the author points out how the Persians are usualy depicted as villains in movies and other western media, which tend to favor the ancient Greeks, who often fight with the Persians.  The author then says that this is an unfair stereotype because the Persians had their own point of view and proud history.  Then the book goes into that history, covering the major kings and their campaigns and how they created the largest empire the world had known up to that time.  There is also a chapter on ancient Persian society and culture.  This is one of several excellent books I've read by the author, Don Nardo, who makes this era of the ancient Greeks, Persians, and Romans come alive.  People of Iranian descent will find it especially rewarding because there is so little out there about their roots in Englsih for general readers.	2001-02-24

If you saw the recent movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; and happen to know a few things about real ancient Roman gladiators, as I do, then you were probably just as disappointed as I was.  Most of the gladiator fights in the film were not accurately staged, especially the way they showed one guy taking on four or more opponents at a time, which rarely happened, if it happened at all!  Anyone who wants to know what these fights were really like should pick up this book.  It tells what the fights were really like and includes numerous fascinating deatils about the different types of gladiators.  There were several that most people have never heard of, including ones that fought blind-folded!! The author also goes into the way the gladiators dressed, and the way Roman society both looked down on them as low lifes but also cheered them as heroes.  The author also points out the movies that did accurately show gladiator fights, &quot;Spartacus&quot; and &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot; both of which I have seen and agree completely with him.  And that's only part of the book.  It also goes into the chariot races and mock naval battles and wild animal fights and more!!  Unfortunately the book is short for someone like me who wants to know even more on the subject.  But the author lists lots of books in the back and I am reading one of these now, &quot;Gladiator&quot; by Micahel Grant, which is also very informative.	2001-02-24

Boy, was I ever wrong!  The author has managed to collect a tremendous amount of facts about Greece's history and important leaders and everytday life, etc. and put them together in a sweeping summary of an ancient civilization.  I also found the many references to archeological studies of Greek sites to be very helpful.  Though shorter than many adult books I have seen on Greece, this one is mcuh better than most.  I heartily recommend it.	2001-02-24

This volume, one of a recent series of studies of ancient Greece and Rome for young people by historian Don Nardo, perfectly blends factual, accurate information about ancient Athenian society with an easy-to-read, often lively writing style.  The first chapter presents an excellent summary of the city and its people in the Bronze Age.  Subsequent chapters cover Athens' growth over the centuries, the establishment of its political institutions, its homelife and social life, the role and status of women, religious beliefs and customs (with a riveting description of the yearly festival and sacrifices dedicated to the goddess Athena), athletic games, art and sculpture, and warfare.  This is non-scholarly historical writing at its best and I recommend it highly to both history teachers and casual readers.	2001-02-24

Still, it's a pretty much balanced presentation.  The chapter on the history of French culture is especially well done and interesting.  I would recommend the book highly to anyone planning a trip to France.	2001-02-24
