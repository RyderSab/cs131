An interesting feature is that many of the longer hymns have different arraingements for different verses, getting more complex as it goes along.  This makes things more interesting for both the player and the listner/singer. <br /> <br />The selections are tilted towards Baptist/Methodist/Pentacostal favorites.  One would like to see a companion volume with Anglican/Lutheran/Catholic type hymns--perhaps including some easy-play LITURGICAL music as well.	2005-09-28

Finally, if one moves far enough away, one will be so far off that one cannot move back, and will have forgotten that it is possible, and will have forgotten that it is desirable. <br /> <br />Yet God is always ready to give a person a chance to return to Him, and will help someone who really wants to be helped.  But He will not force anyone.  He has limited His omnipotence in this way as a sign of His love for us.  (Remember that 1960s saying, \\"If you love something, set it free. If it comes back it will be yours forever.\\"?) <br /> <br />Lewis has played with this concept fictionally in this work.  Those who are in the edges of Hell--not so far away that they have lost all memory of God and the chance to return--are given a chance to come back to Him. But they must renounce everything that has come between them and Him--pride, envy, malice, greed, whatever.  This is harder than it sounds.  As sometimes a surgeon must cut off a limb to save a life, just as chemotherapy may be almost worse than cancer, so the renunciation of what keeps us away from God may be painful, but necessary. <br /> <br />Of course, by stressing human free will, Lewis gives short shrift to divine soveregnty, as another reviewer remarks. But Lewis is not attempting a complete exposition of Christian doctrine here.	2005-07-06

She seems to have some serious problems, most of them probably having to do with the fact that her parents don't seem to know how to raise a child--they seem to either ignore her or smother her.  <br /> <br />However, the plot, although full of rather unpleasant events and attitudes, is realistic.  People do behave that way, and talk that way, and to try to wrap your child up in a cocoon where they are insulated from everything negative and disagreeable is not a good idea.  The child will, sooner or later, encounter people or events like this in real life, and having first done so in fiction s/he will be forearmed.  I wouldn't advise feeding a child a literary diet only of this sort of story, but as a part of a balanced literary diet, it is certainly worthwhile.	2005-06-29

I wondered, though, why Betty didn't just ask her to step out into the garden and then drop-kick her across the straight to Seattle?  I'm sure she could have gotten some of the other women in their circle of friends to help. <br /> <br />Many of the events she tells of show us that teenage girls have always been a handful, whatever they say.  However, in spite of all the complaining and whining, the girls were willing to pich in; how many girls their age nowadays would have something like stuffed pork chops waiting when their parents came home from work? <br /> <br />While \\"Egg\\" left me wondering why anyone in their right mind would want to run a chicken farm in the middle of a howling wilderness, \\"Onions\\" made me wonder if living on an island might not be fun.	2005-06-28

Mr. Dahl had a great imagination, an odd (if somewhat jaundaced) way of looking at things, and a fantastic command of the English language.  I don't know if \\"Charlie\\" or any of his other books have been translated, but I would imagine that it would be difficult to do so. <br /> <br />To the reviewers who were horrified at the fates of the children--that is the point.  They were horrid little brats who got their comeuppances.  In every case they were warned NOT to do something and they did it--and look what happened to them.  Mr. Wonka assures us that they come out OK, although not unchanged. (Violet will probably be blue to the end of her days, for example.) Yet, one is sure that they will have learned from the experience.  Mike surely won't watch nearly so much television, and Veruca certainly won't be nearly so spoilt.  Children aren't nearly as delicate as some parents think they are, and aren't (usually)traumatized by such stories, unless they are unusually sensitive; and in a world that contains things like Abu Ghraib, Kosovo, and the Sudan, the sooner they get toughened up a bit the better. <br /> <br />To the reviewer who didn't like the fact that two of the brats were GIRLS and was afraid that the story would bruise her precious little one's delicate female self-esteem, I'd recommend MATILDA by the same author. (Actually, as a former schoolteacher, my experience with girls is that many of them have too MUCH self-esteem; so many adolescent and pre-adolescent girls seem to think that they rank at least as countesses, and expect to be treated as such.)	2005-06-02

The main character is Sarah Samantha, the middle sister of the title, who is afraid of everything.  She admires her Uncle Romeo's lion's tooth watch fob; Romeo promises to give it to her when she makes him an apple dumpling from the apples of the sapling in the yard.  When the family moves to Minnesota, the children each are allowed to choose one treasure to take, and she chooses the tree. <br /> <br />The family has all sorts of adventures in adjusting to their new life, most especially the infamous Grasshopper Summer; Sarah Samantha must brave the swarm to defend the apple tree.   <br /> <br />Finally the tree produces a crop of apples, and the family goes to meet Uncle Romeo at the train, while Sarah Samantha stays behind to make the apple dumplings.  While she is in the barn doing some chores, two Native Americans (a man older than her father and a boy about the same age as her little brother) come into the house and eat most of the apples.  When Sarah Samantha comes back, she's not afraid of the Indians as she normally would be--she's to MAD to be afraid.  She tells them off, then orders the boy to draw some water and gather eggs, and orders the man to chop up some firewood.   <br /> <br />There are just enough apples for one small dumpling, and she makes it for Uncle Romeo.  He then gives her the lion's tooth on a chain to hang around her neck. <br /> <br />The story gives lots of good historical details about frontier life in Minnesota in an entertaining story.  The moral--that courage is not being unafraid, but being afraid and doing what must be done anyway--arises naturally from the story and one does not feel preached at. <br /> <br />I read this originally in the 4th grade, but I was always an advanced reader.  Most children would read this at the fifth or sixth grade.  However, older children and even adults would like it.	2005-02-17

When most people think of Ian Fleming, they think of \\"James Bond.\\" This is the only children's book he ever wrote, and one wishes that he wrote more. <br /> <br />Forget the Dick VanDyke film, which has very little resemblance to the book. (Not that it is a bad film, mind you, taken by itself.) <br /> <br />In the film, Mr. Potts was a widower; in the book, Mrs. P. was very much alive.  They pushed the time-frame of the book about 75 years, also, and (aside from using the idea of the rehabilitated racecar that could convert into a boat or an airplane) the plot had very little resemblance to that of the book. <br /> <br />The story is fairly simple, but is well told, rather in the manner of a parent telling a bedtime story.  The author is not afraid to use big words, but he explains them.  I remember at about age eight (shortly after I heard my teacher read it out loud to us in school) I used the word 'transmogrification' at home; my Mother told me that wasn't a real word, and I said it was, and we looked it up in the dictionary--and there it was!

This can be appreciated by both children and adults.  The story itself, children will delight in.  JRRT's bilingual puns will delight the more educated adults.  (When the Blacksmith says that the Feast of Sts. Hilarius and Felix was an 'unlucky' day, for example; for those who don't know Latin, 'hilarius' means 'funny' and 'felix' means 'happy.)   <br /> <br />Through all the laughter, JRRT does make some serious points.  In his definition of 'blunderbuss' (lifted from the OED, of which he was a compiler) it says that a blunderbuss has been 'superceded in civilized countries by more sophisticated firearms.'  JRRT immediately points out that, as Farmer Giles' country had not yet been civilized, the blunderbuss was the only kind of gun around, and was fairly rare at that.  This is a dig, of course, at those who would access how 'advanced' a society is by its technology, particularly weaponry.  The fashion-conscious knights, the learned parson, and the young dragons who thought (and are now sure) that knights are 'mythical' also provide subtle commentary which children will not get, but adults will. <br /> <br />Another major theme is that of the ordinary man, living a quiet, comfortable life, who is forced into an extraordinary situation in which his eyes are opened to a larger world--some of it beautiful, some of it horrible--beyond the borders of his snug, smug little corner of it, and who finds out that he's a lot braver, and a lot cleverer than anyone (including himself!) thinks he is.  This is the central theme of 'The Hobbit', and is told in a slighter form here.   <br /> <br />One is tempted to speculate that JRRT's experience in WW I may have had something to do with his attraction to this theme, for in that conflict he was a junior infantry officer in the British Army, in which he found himself, and his fellow soldiers, ordinary young Englishmen--mill workers, farmers, schoolteachers, college students, etc.--found themselves doing things that they never wouldhave thought they ever could or would do.  Some of them very brave things, some of them very clever things, and many of them horrible things.	2005-01-11
US	31330417	R3K1DDQ108T3EC	061800937X	36232774	Letters from Father Christmas, Revised Edition	Books	5	5	5	N	N	This is based on the original edition.	Most children write letters TO Santa; few get letters FROM Santa (or Father Christmas, as British children call him.) The Tolkein children were lucky; their father was one of the top writers of the 20th C. and a fine--if totally untrained--artist. <br /> <br />These letters are little gems.  As the years go on and the Tolkein children got older and more able to follow a complicated story, the letters get more 'literary.'  Also, if you will look at the dates, as the situation in Europe heated up, so did Father Christmas' troubles with the Goblins.  Children listen to the radio, too, and none of the Tolkein children could have been accused of stupidity; they knew, at some level, that something Very Bad was brewing, and I am sure that seeing that Father Christmas could deal with almost any crisis was comforting to them. <br /> <br />As for the illustrations, JRRT had a wonderful sense of color and line.  He was very good at drawing stylized landscapes and interiors.  Who wouldn't want someplace like Cliff House?  He was less successful at drawing people and animals, probably because he knew very little about anatomy.  Still, the portrait of Father Christmas wrapping a package is very fine; his features look somewhat Asiatic.  I don't know if it is because JRRT had trouble drawing European round eyes, or if the Tolkein children were old enough to have seen pictures of Lapps and Eskimos and would have felt that such features would be appropriate to a man who lived at the North Pole.  Also, the picture of the Polar Bear battling the Goblins to save the Good Children's presents was full of movement and spirit enough that one didn't mind the questionable anatomy; the same could be said of the illustration of the accidental flooding of the English Deliveries room. <br /> <br />If you have children in your life, get a copy.  Younger children will love to have these read to them, while older ones will love reading them themselves.	2005-01-11

I had to give myself, therefore, a crash course in literature, especially American literature.  I read such works as Sinclair Lewis' Main Street, Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio, Stephen Leacock's Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (Leacock was Canadian, but he still counts), Garrison Kiellor's Lake Wobegon Days, and works by such great Southern writers as Welty, Cauldwell, Faulkner and O'Connor, not to mention the poetry of Robert Frost.  This list is not complete, but it does show my literary exposure to small-town life. <br /> <br />I am by upbringing a City Mouse or Town Sparrow; I do not like not being able to walk or ride my bicycle almost everywhere I need to go, and to go too long without the feeling of pavement under my feet makes me uncomfortable.  I also dislike American football with a passion.  I'm not sure who said it, but I agree: it \\"combines the two worse aspects of American life--violence & committee meetings.\\" <br /> <br />Have I ever lived in a rural or small-town setting?  Yes; three times.  The first time was when I taught high school in Greenfield, Ohio for a year; the second was after I finished my MLS from Kentucky and was unable to find a job, and lived with my parents' in Heber Springs, Arkansas; the third when I took a position at Andrew College in Cuthbert, Georgia.  It is very hard living in such places if you are single, educated, and neither Baptist nor Methodist.  I hated it; I hated the poverty (both economic and intellectual), the narrow religiosity (I am a Christian, but American Evengelicalism as practiced in small towns, particularly in the South, is something which with I have strong theological disagreements), the lack of cultural amenities, the racism and sexism, the insincerity and hypocrisy, and the isolation. <br /> <br />I found all of this and more reflected in the book, only more so.  As everything in Texas is bigger than it is anywhere else--or so any Texan will tell you--so Odessa is a much larger small town than any of the three I cited above.  But the same ethos exists; I saw almost all of it--if on a smaller scale--in the three places.  I have been in Midland/Odessa, briefly, having interviewed for a job at UT/Permian Basin; I knew halfway through the interview that even if they offered me the job, I wouldn't take it.  The job itself was OK, but I couldn't see living there. <br /> <br />&lt;=====Odessa, TX <br /> <br />Civilization======> <br /> <br />That is the impression I got from my brief visit, and nothing in the book has lead me to doubt it.    <br /> <br />The treatment of the HS football players seemed to me little better than child abuse, particularly in the case of the young man called \\"Boobie\\". (At least they didn't spell it with a 'y'!) <br /> <br />And the racism!  I won't say that where I came from there were and are no racists, but at least they knew enough to be at least a little bit ashamed of it and to try to hide it.  Good 'Christian' folk of Odessa, are you not familiar with the Scripture that says that God has made 'of one blood all the nations of men to live together on the earth' (Acts 17:26) and that 'there is neither Jew or Greek [or as you might say 'neither White nor Black'], neither bond nor free, neither male nor female, but all are one in Christ Jesus'?  Can you not see that racism is, therefore, an offense before God?   <br /> <br />And you who would post the Ten Commandments on your schoolhouse walls, have you not them posted on your hearts that you can see that in your excessive and immoderate devotion to and exultation of high school football--harmless in its proper place, but come on people, it is a game, it is something one should do for fun--you are violating at least the first two Commandments, and possibly, in the pre-game prayer, the Third?  And that the academic coddling and resulting dishonesty is a violation of the Nineth?  That you can't or won't see it--is it invincible ignorance, willful blindness, or just plain old hypocrisy? <br /> <br />I am giving it three stars for the quality of the writing. <br />	2005-01-11

Urras is very like Earth; the main difference is that their moon is (marginally) habitable.  Having discovered this early on, the Urrans became capable of space travel much earlier in their political-social development than we did on Earth.<br /><br />Just as they develop the ability to explore and exploit their moon, there arises an anarcosocialistic philosopher called Odo.  Her followers become troublesome, and are invited to remove to Arrakis to build a utopian society on their own.<br /><br />Now, LeGuin is no Marxist herself; having been raised in \\"the People's Republic of Berkely\\" (her parents were professors at UC/B; her father was a famous anthropologist, although I don't remember her mother's field), she was aware of and sympathetic to Marxist theory and ideas.  However, like any halfway aware person, she knew what happened in Russia, China, etc. when these countries attempted to set up Marxist societies.<br /><br />\\"Ah!\\" say a defender of Communist theory,\\"That is because not everyone in a country is equally committed to realizing the ideal.  Many don't understand it; many oppose it.  That is why these attempts have failed.\\"  Please remember that most Communists are, at least, at first, well-meaning reformers; most really want to make the world a better place, even if they become corrupted once they get into power.  Lenin and Trotsky really wanted to make Russia a better place, and Mao firmly belived (at least at first) that Communism would make China great; Stalin was another kettle of fish entirely, or course.<br /><br />LeGuin responds, \\"OK, let's have a group of colonists, all True Believers, go off and try to establish a this Utopia on their own, where the 'dead hand' of the old ways won't effect them.\\"  The novel is a result of this thought-experiment; she could as easily have chosen Plato's Republic, except that nobody has seriously tried to establish a Platonic state, and several people have tried to establish Marxist ones.<br /><br />These events happened about 200 years before the start of the book.  On Urras, we have various nation-states dominated by two powers which have a strong similarity to the United States and the late, unlamented Soviet Union.  On Arrakis, the descendants of the Odoites maintain their ideological experiment.  And it works, more or less.  But at what a price!  Individualism is repressed not by government--as there is none per se--but by social pressure to conform.  Originality and excellence are frowned upon, for they lead to inequality and thus inequity.  Stifled by this dull, grey, conformist society, a brilliant young Arraki physicist defects to Urras, the first Arraki in 200 years to do so.<br /><br />Of course, Urras is no better.  All the excesses of Western Capitalism are seen in the one major country, while all the evils of Soviet Communism are seen in the other--all exaggerated to be sure that the reader does not miss the point.  Due to there being no Democratic Socialists in the Capitalist country, the government has not been moved to construct even a minimal 'safety net', and the Communist country (for similar reasons) is more brutal than the Soviet Union or Red China were even in the worst Stalinist/Maoist stages.  The exile of the Odoists was seen at the time to be a preventive of revolution, but Urras lost something important when they left.<br /><br />Although LeGuin is sympathetic to the ideals of Arrakis, she knows human nature too well not to know that the Utopian society there can't work without repressing significant aspects of that nature, but rather than telling us this she shows us how this repression can't be kept up, and how the Odoist experament can't be kept up much longer.<br /><br />I did not give this more than three stars as, while the ideas were interesting, it takes more than interesting ideas to make a good novel.  The plot is merely a hook upon which to hang the ideas, and none of the characters are very memorable.eas, and none of the characters are very memorable.	2004-12-14

(I can't speak to the defects of the edition, as I haven't seen this edition.)<br /><br />W.H. Auden said of LOTR \\"if anyone says that he does not like it, I will never trust his literary judgement again.\\"  When one of the greatest English-language poets of the 20th C. says something like this, he should be paid attention to.  Now, I'm not saying that anyone should say that he likes it if he does not; far from it.  But consider: do you consider your literary judgement superior to Audens?  What have you written lately?  Do you not think that, when your evaluation of a work is so different from that of someone like him that perhaps, just perhaps, you may have missed something?  Just because someone who is tone-deaf can't appreciate a Beethoven symphony, or someone who is color-blind can't appreciate a painting by Matisse doesn't mean that there is something wrong with either the symphony or the painting, but rather with the ears and eyes of the beholder.<br /><br />The charge that JRRT is a racist falls flat as soon as it is seriously examined.  The whole point of LOTR is the members of the different races--dwarf, elf, human, hobbit--uniting and overcoming their mutual distrust and dislike for one another in the face of something that will destroy them all if they do not unite.  The one character who is arrogantly sure of his race's superiority, and who never thinks that he could be wrong, is Denethor, and look what happens to him!<br /><br />As for the charge of the glorification of war, that, too falls flat.  JRRT had been a junior officer in the British Army's infantry during WW I; he was at THE SOMME.  He was one of seven good friends to enlist together; only two survived the War.  How could a man like that glorify war?  Read his descriptions of the Dead Marshes and the Morannon in LOTR, and of Sam's reaction to the skirmish in Ithilien; read the description of the Battle of the V Armies and the aftermath in THE HOBBIT.  These are not the writings of a warmonger.<br /><br />In short, for those who did not like the book, finding it 'boring, trivial or contemptable', JRRT himself said that he didn't mind, as he had similar opinions of their writings, or of the sort of writing they appear to prefer.  For those of you who think he had a sinister political or social agenda, read it again, a little more carefully, and you will see that you are mistaken.Armies and the aftermath in THE HOBBIT.

No parent in his or her right mind in the early 21st century would allow their kids to do what these kids do; it simply would not be safe to have them running around New York City unsupervised.  They'd get kidnapped or shot or something else equally unpleasant; even if by some miracle the children got home safe, some officious neighbor would find out about it and call Child Protective Services.  In the mid twentieth century, it was taken for granted that a child who knew enough to look both ways when crossing the street and take similar basic precautions would be OK running around in the big city.    Enright's writing gives us a window into a simpler era which (alas!) is now long past.  One pities the modern child stuck at home with television and video games, and who cannot run about the city experiencing new things and learning about life the way that Randy and Mona and Rush and even little Oliver do.      I also liked how the children weren't fenced off in a child-centered ghetto, but had friends of all ages, both adults and other children.  Mrs. Oliphant must have been based on someone Enright knew and was fond of--a grandmother or great-aunt, perhaps?    This is a book that both children and adults will enjoy.	2004-11-03
