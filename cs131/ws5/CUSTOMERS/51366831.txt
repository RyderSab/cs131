Why would you switch to .NET?  There are a lot of questions that we could ask about .NET that aren't easy to ask.  .NET is very broad, and thus, Wrox brought together some of their best authors together so that they share what they knew best about .NET.  This book WILL provide the information you need to learn about the new things in .NET.<br />Remember the old time with the XML series of books?  Most books had at least a few similar chapter.  This is Wrox's response to counter that.  This book is a foundation to learn a lot about the .NET Framework.  It will be covering what most developers want to know, for both C# &amp; VB.NET.  This is a book that you use in conjunction with other current or upcoming .NET books that will be more focused on their subject.<br />Having multiple authors on this title, I believe, is a good thing.  Simply because it's impossible to have one person know all about the .NET Framework as well as it's good to see multiple opinions.  There are over 25 technical reviewers that read through this book to make sure that the flow was as easy as possible from an author to another.<br />For the rating, it was a debate between 4 &amp; 5.  Sure, I'm always looking for more so I guess that's where the 4 would be coming from.  However, since I will be using this book as a reference for any other .NET books that will refer to this one for .NET Framework content, it's worth a 5-star.  I will be more than delighted to have other books skip the usual &quot;CLR&quot; chapters and point at this book instead.	2001-10-20

Because of that time issue, the book is indeed somewhat smaller than, let's say, a Professional VB.NET book or a Business Objects.<br />However, if we dig further in the information that is offered in this book compared to the available information on the web, you will undoubtfully find this book quite interesting and you will definitely understand a lot more about the new VB.NET than you would without this book.<br />The TOC is more than available so I won't go over it but let's just say that you will definitely find out what's new, what is completely different from VB6, how to work out the new web capabilities, how to work with ADO.NET, and much much more.  The information on those subject are well explained and thought out.<br />All in all, if you have the slightest curiosity in VB.NET and wish to know more, this book is definitely your best bet for now.	2001-03-15

It's touching a very interesting subject and yet, it cannot really go in full technical details on how to do it.  My personal expectations on this book were about looking at technology by hard technology fan rather than money-driven projects or from consultants.<br />This book, though a bit of simple light read, will show current and upcoming technologies in a raw science form; why &amp; simple how those master scientists are creating outstanding technology by first having fun and at looking at simple problems.  <br />Want to get a feel about the possible next eBook?  It will explain how this could happen.  Want to see what a computer chip in your shoe could give to you?  You will read the why.<br />It was a delight to see that there are masterminds behind the annoying fact that computers are dumb.  too dumb.  The potential to make them live and help the humanity is there and When Things Start to Think is trying to convey that is a simple &amp; easy read for a broad audience.	2001-02-19

As complete as the product itself, nothing less!  This book will take you, as either a developer or an administrator (or both!), through all facets that makes a successfull BizTalk Server installation.<br />As with previous Stephen book, this one takes a case-study through most of the book and complement it with the new features or the chapter.  You will learn to leverage each of those functionality in order to achieve our case-study project.  Also usual, this book contains a lot of very technical knowledge, knowledge found deeply inside the BizTalk server with a big touch of experience, all given to the readers in this book!	2001-01-30

This book earns its &quot;Database&quot; title right.  Indeed, it has to go some XML basics but this book is hugely focused in bringing a practical Database end for XML instead of only explaining XML.<br />This book covers some SQL Server 2000 XML capabilities for both input and output; it will go over a series of step on HOW to bring a current database into a XML document with DTD; and in reverse, how to take an XML document and create a relational database with it; it goes over data transmission and marshalling; in short, it goes over many many things that DBA will have to go through.  <br />(** at the moment of this review, January 2001, the Amazon Table of Content is definitely wrong (about some PERL book or something) **)	2001-01-03

Indeed, its undertaking is major: how to explain everything about Visual Basic planning, designing, development, and deployment in little over 400 pages?<br />In that regards, the book does it pretty good.  It will go over some of the VB myths and concepts; explains them and &quot;fix&quot; the ones that needs to be fixed.<br />I think that the best thing about this book is the number of very good books that it makes reference to.  Most of them are actually amazing and will provide further (but dated) reading on some of the concepts.<br />This book would be great for people that wishes for an All-In-One start in starting to plan / design a VB application.  They will then have to go further to enhance their skills but this book will provide a good start as well as good further reading references.	2001-01-03

I would say that about 40-45% of this book is to &quot;learn and understand&quot; how to THINK about reusable component while most of the rest is for the actual VB code that does it (and some leftovers for win32 &amp; web interfaces).<br />Indeed, it takes, at the least, an interesting position on Business Logic where he is mainly putting this logic on the data tier but I could agree that in some cases, it could be beneficial.<br />As a .NET reviewer, I have to take special care about books that I'm now reading on VB6 code.  This book can easily be migrated to the VB.NET syntax mainly because it's the thinking of the book rather than the actual code.  Most or all of the ideas are available with VB.NET but the code will obviously needs some changes in order to accomodate ADO.NET, COM+ Application (somewhat really different than what we are used to with VB6), and some syntax modifications that came along with VB.NET.<br />Even though there is this &quot;issue&quot; about Business Rules, this book remains an impressive reading about Enterprise Application ARCHITECTURE.	2000-12-10

No, they just give a one-stop place to learn how to bring down a networked server.  Of course, they have some fixes on how to prevent them but it mainly comes to &quot;install the latest patch&quot; and &quot;install a firewall&quot;.  Well, we all know this part and most companies now have firewall (that the installation is good or not...).<br />This book will go beyond that point and explains to managers why security is important; Why Firewall &amp; patches will not prevent you from being cracked; Why do you need to understand the hackers in order to catch them; etc.  Don't let the size of this book (about 250 pages) put you down since the author judiciously decided to keep to the facts rather than speculate.  You will only find good information.<br />The only thing that it still lacks (but it is also hard to have in a book because of on-going product (and hacker tools) development) is to define which firewall applications is good; the pros &amp; cons of each of them; is it helpful to have multiple firewall and if so; how to set it up; etc.  I was tired of all those books that will mainly help hackers (could be called Implementing Security Breaches) and this book is finally a book for Managers &amp; IT Personnel that needs &quot;written&quot; proofs rather than just tools.  I see it as a step forward and my only hope is that we will soon have a book that fully goes into implementing security.	2000-11-21

As a result, there is not that many books that are available compared to a subjet like XML (Wrox have 2 books with UML, while they have 10 books with XML in their title, not including the ones that talks about it).<br />Unfortunately (or is it?), UML is one of those knowledge that are simply a requirement to any enterprise development with good time to market and much better documentation and knowledge of an application.  VB came to market as an easy tool and it is still like this.  With time (and versions), VB is now capable of doing good scalable enterprise architecture but it also lacks the enterprise developers that the C area got.<br />This book will help change the tide in VB favor.  First of all, this is UML book to learn from scratch what UML can provide and why is it important to use UML to have a successful application.  Then, it will bring the UML to the VB world and see how UML will help the VB architect and developers in order to obtain that success.<br />Technically talking, the author brought case-studies with the book as well as a good technical background.  This is a go-get book.	2000-10-29

As a reminder, DNA has been there for years and was working under NT4.  It has been revamped with trumpets with a new name, .Net, with all those new services.  The authors do have this in mind and they will tell you where .Net will be improving features.<br />I would recommend this book to anybody that wants to know what is Windows DNA/.Net (beside thinking it's everything that Microsoft is providing for developers!).  Of course, you cannot have all those technologies into one book and expect the best coverage on all of them.  Having that in mind, the authors create an incredible reference for developers that wants to upgrade to a more scalable &amp; distributed environment as well as to take leverage of the new technologies that came with Windows 2000 (for developers that is).<br />The only thing that I have to mention (and I did to Wrox) was that I personnaly believe that this book, though the readers needs to have professional knowledge of development, would be better inside the Beginning series since this book serves as an overview reference of all those technologies.  Wrox will undoubtfully then release multiple Professional books that will go further in those new technologies (such as doing COM+ events or asynchronous components, having XML Business Objects, etc.).<br />As a bottom line, most of the authors wrote in a confident programming style and it is a very interesting book to go through.  ...  But I can't wait for the .Net one!	2000-10-24

Although I'll agree that the writing is somewhat easy at some places and at others, useless, but it's also a book that was published in March 2000 where it was among the first to touch the subject.  <br />One of the funny area was that in the middle of the book, we are 'scraping' part of what we've done so far because of a 'design flaw'.  Well it shows the ongoing environment of Business VB Development but at the same time, it was not really something I was expecting in a book.<br />Beyond that, it's at least worth 3/5 since there it does contains some interesting concepts even though it's a light read.  It is definitely not a bad book but it could have some improvements.  I did learn with this book and I will use some of those concepts.<br />Windows DNA (hopefully .NET soon) are pumping out right now, about Scalability, Security, and so forth, we'll soon be able to compare with the DNA/.NET new writers.	2000-10-02

For all of you VB Leads that needs to maintain standards documentation, this book could replace that documentation or at least, give you a pretty good head start.  <br />For all of the non-experienced (or not trained) VB programmers out there, following the guidelines of this book will make you much better, efficient, and 'marketable' since everybody will now be able to read your code and actually understand it.<br />Now we all know that documentation &amp; good coding is a must but developers just don't it.  Obviously, this book can't help that but it will at least give Lead developers something to stand on and work it out from there.	2000-09-26

It contains a very complete explanation  of most CSS properties that you will need for your upcoming web sites.   Positioning, Fonts &amp; Colors, Boxes, Formatting; it's all there.<br />For  those of you who have to transition real print document (mostly suitable  for PDF), well you will find a way to have your print document pretty  similar to your current print document.  In fact, one of the small  case-studies is with this issue but if you go through the sections of boxes  &amp; positioning, you will find most of your answers there.<br />Great  reference and I would suggest to anybody that wants alternative to 'Table  positioning' and other formatting issues.	2000-08-31

This book is  somewhat to far-stretch in terms of who's doing what.  Everybody is  conspiring against each other and Paul is the man.  Well even though he did  pretty good in the other book, I think he losing it to Jack Ryan which  contains a much deeper character.  <br />With the recent ups &amp; downs of  TC's books, maybe he should slow down a bit and work harder on his  characters (Op-Center, Net Force, Power Plays, Jack Ryan).  We had jack for  what, almost 2 decades?  Paul's characters will almost have the same number  of books in 3 years as well as having a few ones with Net Force and the  Power Play so the depth is not there as it was before.<br />But the book was  good enough for me to look forward for the next one, which I hope TC will  take more time to do.	2000-08-31

For hard Tom Clancy's fan, this is still a good book,  but for the others, there is now some other authors that are taking the  space.<br />I was used to have something like 200 pages of story setup (the  what &amp; why), and then 500+ pages of action-packed story and this book  is the complete opposite while there is some small action during the 700  pages of story setup.  And what about the end... you have a big intrigue  that last about 10 pages and whoops, the enemy's destroyed and we cut the  story short with a 'dhuh?'.  I also like, as some other reviewers, the fact  that the Chinese have something like 3 divisions of tank and the Americans  drops, with only one airstrike, smart bombs that destroys nearly all of  them...  Now, usually, TC would have explains this but in this case, you  will just see a Chinese communique that they don't have any news from all  their divisions anymore!  That was the action part which could be reduce to  'we nailed them Mr. President, somehow and you are not on a need-to-know  basis'.<br />Beside that, the rest was mostly TC style and it was welcome but  I would suggest taking a look at Balance of Power from James W. Huston.	2000-08-31

The price of the book also reflect it's  small size.<br />Having that in mind, this book will bring you a great  heads-up on what's coming on with NGWS and C#.  I would recommand this book  to any C++ programmers that are looking in the future for a similar  language.<br />But the book is also explained well enough in order for VB  programmers to feel confident in what they are reading and what the  differences will be.  And for those VB/ASP(VBScript) programmers, this book  will give you a great insight for the next major language that ASP+ will be  using since the ASP+ compiler was done with C# (yup, not more VBScript; VB,  C#, and other, but no scripting anymore).<br />The author seems knowledgable  enough to both know VB &amp; C++, and now C# as well.  This is more than  encouraging.	2000-08-10

But  it faded out when I saw that this book did not really included real-life  examples or case-studies.<br />A problem that I often see is that the examples  included in the book are just like data island, they don't know about each  other and let us decide where we can really use them.  <br />This book does  have one small case-study toward the end but it does not reflect so much  the high theorical level of the beginning.<br />As mentionned in a different  review, a lot of buzzwords, and it's true; then again, this book DOES give  you a GREAT THEORICAL aproach to SOLVE Distributed Applications PROBLEMS,  but lacks in it's bringing us a good implementation of solutions (even  though the level of coding was fairly high).<br />What I hope in the future,  is just a book that will join all those buzzwords into one great  application with all those technologies &amp; softwares.	2000-08-09

Just the TOC for  this one is in 4 pages!!!  The book is worth it just for this  chapter.<br />Then, the book goes to some extent into Pipelines, Commerce,  Search, Personalization, and all the Site Server's components.<br />Once you  will be through this book and need more information, I would strongly  recommand the Site Server 3.0 Personalization And Membership, and the  Professional Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition; both from Wrox Press.	2000-08-08

VB? ASP? SQL? Server-IIS? something else?&quot;.  And since the answer is  &quot;Well, All of them of course.&quot;, people are still short a good way  to start on each of those.<br />Well Wrox brought a very good book for those  Internet startups (with Microsoft technologies).  You will most definitely  find an answers to all of your first questions on the How-To of an  eCommerce web site.<br />Actually, the real title of this book would have been  too long to fit since it does more than VB, ASP, SQL, and MTS. To my  surprise, it also goes over Credit Card security with 3rd parties such as  DataCash and CyberCash, it goes over simple Private/Public Key Pair, Order  Pipeline, Hosting, Up-sell, Cross-sell, and even Marketing, + more.<br />Also,  I have to admit that the coding used is well-formed, neat &amp; clean, and  extensive.  I'm sure that the example would bring new content to some  seasoned eCommerce expert as well.<br />Last but not least, if you are a  complete newcomer in the programming area, you might want to consider  having other book such as Beginning ASP 3.0, Beginning ASP Databases,  Beginning VB6; at the same time than the Beginning eCommerce in case you  are not sure of what the syntax means.  Even though this book is pretty  easy to follow, it also assume you have some programming knowledge (which  can be overcome by those other books).<br />Good Job.	2000-08-08

What it does go into is the ADO objects (through  Disconnected Recordsets), to Data Shaping.<br />This book concludes with  almost 300 pages of Appendix on Reference, Overviews, Object Models, and  more.  If you know what you are looking for in ADO &amp; RDS (which is  probably the case for a &quot;Professional&quot; book), you will find it's  answer here.<br />To my surprise, this book also includes 2 nice chapters  about Oracle and it's usage with ADO.

Features  such as State Rollback, Load Balancing, and obviously, more objects usage  on a distributed environment.<br />You will also find some good usage of MSMQ  and web-oriented objects.<br />The only thing still missing is to see where  the authors would fit XML into all this.	2000-08-08

I'm an Internet consultant  usually working around programmers and network engineers but sometimes, I  need a fresh graphical look when we do not have anybody to do it.<br />This  book definitely gave me a great insight of a lot of &quot;How-to&quot; with  Illustrator.  If you look at an image and wonder &quot;How did they do  that?&quot;.  Well the answer could most likely reside in Illustrator and  this book will explain how.<br />I would recommend this book to any Internet  beginners that wants to know how to design nice design without taking a  one-way trip to hell.	2000-08-08

Of course, this a Programmer's Reference so it's not a book to learn and it's obviously IE5 specific.   If you can live with those constraint and  you are looking to do get the best out of IE, take this book and you will  have all required information.<br />Bottom line, very practical and compact  reference; but it will probably need some adjustments when Microsoft will  release future XML capabilities to be conform to the W3C recommendations.	2000-07-27

If you like sub warfare, I guess it will be good for you; for the Clancy's fan, better look elsewhere.<br />The story is about only one submarine hitting more than 60  targets in a half secret war.  Most of the story don't make much sense (in  my thoughts) where the US are not sending much of the US fleet against  China and bet on that one submarine.<br />And don't get me wrong, I've read  90% of Tom Clancy's book so I do like most of his work.	2000-07-27

I like it.  I'm very happy that this book is not, once again, explaining XML from scratch (like most XML book including the VB one).  This book contains one  case-study and it follows it through the end.<br />This case-study is about a  working and normal web site, one about traveling, so this is finally an XML  book that actually have real-life examples and not some useless pieces of  code that does not tie in to OUR applications.<br />For XML newcomers, I would  strongly suggest taking a look at Beginning XML first and polish your  knowledge with this one.	2000-07-27

I was waiting with great expectation it's release at Amazon since I'm plugged to their ASPToday web site.<br />This book is worth 5 stars  because of the following:<br />It came out barely after MS announced it but  contains a lot of information about the subject.<br />MS has work with the  writers to make sure the content will be right.<br />It is well-written by  known ASP programmers (and writers).<br />The content is get-to-the-point on  current ASP issues and how ASP+ will fix this.<br />Show ASP+ coding with both  VB7 &amp; C#.<br />There is a lot more information than the ASPToday's  articles so that the book is more than handy.<br />Written well enough for  newcomers to understand it, but I would strongly suggest having ASP  experience before-hand.  Remember it's a PREVIEW and it means that it's  good for people who wants to know it advance where MS is going with ASP.	2000-07-25

It contains a very good approach to learn about XML well-formed documents, CSS for XML, XSL(T),  DTD, and it also have some nice Case-Studies that goes along.  Hey, you  even have an introduction to ASP and another one for HTML; for those of you  new to the Internet.<br />Most of the XML books (straight one, not XML for VB  for example) contains the same TOC but this one has the best approach so  far.  <br />If you are new to XML, take this one.<br />If you know a bit of XML  (and PROGRAMMED it), you can take the Professional XML which will go a  little bit more in depth (not that much)<br />If you know what you are doing  with XML and wants to learn more about XSLT, get the XSLT Programmer's  Reference(great book) from Wrox.<br />If you want a very good Case-Study, take  the Professional XML Design and Implementation (also good).<br />Then you are  off with ASP XML, VB XML, or Java XML.<br />Happy XML hunting.	2000-07-23
US	51366831	R380JLTFUXNSJZ	1861003129	989194807	XSLT Programmer's Reference	Books	5	6	10	N	N	Great XSLT (don't confuse with XML) reference	Okay, now that you know about having your data into XML, what do you do with it?  And since browser compatibility with XML is somewhat limited and not really available to the general public (too much beta), you have to  look at a more extensive way to show your XML than straight CSS.<br />This  book is the one I've read that contains the BEST reference about XSLT.   I've read a lot of book that covers only a little bit for each functions.   This book does contain a lot of explanation to it.<br />This book is NOT MEANT  as a way to LEARN XML/XSL but rather a way to BETTER PROGRAM/UNDERSTAND XSL  once you know XML.  That's what a Programmer's Reference is for.<br />If you  are looking for a book to tell you what is XSLT, get the Beginning XML or  Professional XML, depending on your XML level.  Once you have mastered  that, you'll be ready for this book.	2000-07-23

It will show you how to set up a general development environment  for both ASP, VB, and SQL.  It also shows how they created from scratch all  of those like what was the thinking for the SQL part, how it interacts with  VB components &amp; ASP files.<br />Good reading for beginners to intermediate  web people.  For the other one, it will be a light read since I see that  the author's coding is somewhat not much optimized.	2000-06-23

You are currently managing a project which requires real-life example of computer break-in? You just are looking for all  possible security break-in in one book.<br />If you answered yes to any of  those, read this book.  You will find some (or maybe many) suprises on how  it is both easy to break-in and to secure your computer.<br />The best thing  for this book is the fact that all trouble has a solution and all of it is  written there.	2000-06-19

If you do, well you have read other books that are most probably covering  MTS anyway and that coverage should be more than enough to most  people.<br />If you need to know how to implement MTS controls inside your VB  app, the VB6 Business Objects, VB6 Distributed Objects, and the VB6  databases books, all from Wrox, will give you the information that you need  about MTS but will also give you a lot more information about good  components creation for MTS and how to use DCOM with a good  performance.<br />In recap, a good book but you probably know what you need  while getting to the MTS level	2000-06-02

If you already have experience on working with VB for n-tier applications and knows ADO pretty well, look  elsewhere.<br />This book covers a great deal of material, thus going over  some details of them.  This book is good for beginners to intermediate  people that wants to have quick solutions.<br />For the others, for example,  if you are looking for a better implementation of n-tier or to pass data  between components; you will have some information in this book but I would  suggest the Visual Basic 6 Business Objects and VB6 Distributed Objects,  both from Wrox, to get a full coverage on the subject.<br />Overall, this book  is good for VB/Data starters.	2000-06-02

It's basically trying to put JavaScript everywhere without any details or real-life actions.<br />All exemples are very briefly explained and have provides NO BONUSES to anyone that have at least a small experience of  JavaScript.<br />My goal when purchasing this book was to learn new tricks  with JavaScript since I'm coming from VB and VBScript so I wanted to learn  the special things about JavaScript.  LOOK ELSEWHERE IN THAT CASE.<br />BUT,  if you are looking at WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT AND WHERE CAN I USE IT? it might  be an 'okay' start.	2000-03-20

If you know what XML is about but are looking for practical real-life exemples, look elsewhere.  If you know XML and want to know everything  about it's internal work and how to work with DTD, that would be your  book.<br />I've also ordered the Professional XML IE5 Programmer's Reference  at the same time and this book gave me an overview of what I can do with  XML on the Internet and THEN I had an idea of what to do of the  Professional XML book.<br />You have to ask you those questions :  Do I need  to know how to show XML with XSL, ASP, DHTML, HTML?  If yes, look elsewhese  first. Do I need an XML reference to know how to create XML files? If yes,  look no further.	2000-03-20

I guess that it is an &quot;okay&quot; book for an exam but for real life, it's something else.  Then again, it depends on the quality of developers we  want out there.<br />I'm a 4 years experience business application developer  where my only working interface is the web through ASP or DHTML application  (but also for Netscape so...) and i'm lacking some experience for UI  interfaces like VB Applications, ActiveX Documents and others.  From  comments for that book, it was meant as a general book and it is; the only  problem is that it goes quite fast on every subjects.<br />I would say that it  is a beginner's book but then, some of the language is quite technical so  the book is more than focused on the exam's objectives.  Also, even though  you have 1200 pages, most of them are half blank so don't count on the  number of pages to make your idea.<br />Then again, for the exam's, it's not  bad and probably one of the best.  For extensive developer references, go  look at Wrox books like VB6 Business Objects and ADO/RDS with ASP.	2000-01-18

I first bought this book for the RDS part since I've been working with ADO since it got out.  I tought I knew ADO and even though I knew a lot about it, I've learned as much about ADO than about RDS with this book! <br />Good  for any programmers working with ADO, as always, Wrox made it possible for  beginners to understand the book and for experienced programmers to learn  new stuff.<br />Another must by Wrox and I'm waiting to get a hand on the  &quot;Professional Ado 2.5 Rds Programming With Asp 3.0&quot; that should  be coming out soon.	2000-01-18

If you want to do n-tier architecture, don't go further except if you want to get the Professional Visual Basic 6 Distributed Objects from the same author.<br />You can get into  a more *real-life* programming examples with this book and ALL exemples are  very well explained.  It gets you in every twist there is to do good OOP  with Visual Basic 6.<br />For beginner's to intermediate programmers, you  might have some difficulties BUT it's written well enought where you can  follow anyway.
