With Clarkes Odyssey and Baxters Manifold series among my personal favourites - I had to buy this book.<br /><br />In Times Eye mysterious satellites appear all around the Earth and scramble time, bringing together twenty- first-century soldiers, nineteenth-century British and Indian soldiers; and the armies of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great. Part of an alien intervention we are led to believe. Something made up by the firstborns, - a species terrible old, old beyond our imagining. But still after 200 plus pages the mystery of the eye-like satellites isn't really solved.<br /><br />So, here we go - the plot is ok for an opening act, but it isn't spectacular. So - Clarke, Baxter - you better deliver in the sequel!!!<br /><br />-Simon	2005-10-09

Steven Rose strikes a nice balance between the two.<br /><br />The book begins with a an evolutionary story starting from proto-cells in the pre-biotic soup to axons, dendrites, synapses and brain \\"modules\\" A brilliant tour I might add.<br /><br />Lots of details and insights that I found a joy to read.<br /><br />Throughout it is stressed that the brain's developmental history<br /><br />is made in interaction with the environment to determine what it is going to be, how it works and why. Even though the subject matter is very complex Steven Rose manages to give the needed overview.<br /><br />Sometimes Steven Rose pops up with strong views on subjects I would have thought to be widely accepted. E.g. Personally I don't agree that Richard Dawkins meme-theory is as bad as Steven Rose makes it out to be - one could argue that the evolutionary idea is for biological things, not for meme ideas, but I wouldn't be upset if someone would say that evolution works fine on memes as well. But nevermind, it won't distract you from the overall narrative.<br /><br />The last chapters are devoted to a human future where neuroscience might become neurotechnology for mending and manipulating the mind. Even though much of it is speculative Steven Rose seems to be able to tell science from science fiction, and therefore be a valuable voice in the debate.<br /><br />I haven't read \\"The Future of the Brain\\", also by Steven Rose, so I wouldn't be able to tell, if they are identical - but I can tell you that this book is a brilliant read!<br /><br />-Simon	2005-09-28

Reading this book will be a lot of hard work, as each chapter takes a lot of thinking and reflecting.<br /><br />But is also lots of fun. And Susan Blackmore<br /><br />guides you through the subject with plenty of good and precise insights. So, it is well worth the effort.<br /><br />Some chapters I would have liked longer and more in depth, while some could have been shortened considerable in my view. However, with a subject matter that has kept the best thinkers on the planet busy for at least the last two millennia - I guess you shouldn't be surprised that readers might disagree on the weight certain issues are given in this book.<br /><br />Nevertheless, as far as I can tell, consciousness<br /><br />gets covered from all the angles you would expect from such a book. From neurology and biology to philosophy and onwards to artificial intelligence. Certainly, I don't feel that there is anything missing in Blackmores introduction to the subject of consciousness.<br /><br />Like other readers I feel that it is far too early for the construction and reinforcement of any orthodoxy or dogma in the field of consciousness (Except of course that I think we should keep the loony stuff out - and there I go, on my way to my own definitions of good and bad).<br /><br />And I do enjoy Dennett as much as the next guy - but from time to time in the book you have the feeling that Dennett is \\"truth\\", while the author feels free to deal a mortal blow or two to others, as being merely silly believers in the cartesian theatre model.<br /><br />Certainly I don't think e.g. Antonio Damasio is given fair deal in this book (as I consider his work really outstanding and far above any cartesian theatre illusions). Damasio is also more in line with what I think might be the truth of the matter that Dennett. Blackmore has the bias the other way around. Or so it seems. But nevermind.<br /><br />Still, it is a brilliant and enlightening book.<br /><br />-Simon	2005-09-24

And imho not to much use for the average person, as psychology most of the time weren't better than your wise old aunt anyway (most of time worse, actually).<br /><br />  Basicly, psychology dealt with a lot of more or less welldefined problems, which it then thought about curing. But psychology had little to say about life as it presented itself to the average person. By dealing with the relationship between positive emotions and win-win situations, and speculating that we may be on the threshold of an era of win-win games and good-felling - this book comes along way in making psychology interesting and relevant for the people of the 21'st century.	2005-07-17

Why do some people commit<br /><br />evil acts? What is evil? Does evil always carry<br /><br />within itself its own destruction?<br /><br />These are eternal questions. And questions that we as<br /><br />a society must be able to answer, if we are ever to see<br /><br />an improvement of the human condition.<br /><br />The rise and fall of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler is<br /><br />a case story of evil.  But all too often the intricacies of WW2 battles and details of Holocaust crimes overshadows the psychology of the people and leaders involved in this the most epic of wars.<br /><br />With his new book David Lewis tries to correct this by giving<br /><br />us the psychology of the man who was to be known as the Fuhrer.<br /><br />Raised in a family with a distant and unloving father,<br /><br />the young man becomes an orphan after having watched his mother die in agony.

After the war he eventually rises to the position of absolute ruler of Germany.<br /><br />Surely ww1 did something to Adolf Hitler. But<br /><br />this books offers more - the tantalizing new theory that the psychopathology of post ww1 Adolf Hitler was also the result of psychiatric treatment for hysterical blindness gone horriblely wrong. That the doctor who was supposed to cure Hitler for his illness after (the supposed) gas attack, actually pushed him further in the direction of megalomania and world conquest.<br /><br />I suppose the theory is still speculation, and I am not sure<br /><br />that it actually adds that much to the picture of the causes of evil that we have already.<br /><br />But the book makes it plausible that evil was not cured by doctor, but made worse by a doctor.<br /><br />Thats pretty stunning stuff.<br /><br />-Simonattack, actually pushed him further in the direction of megalomania and world conquest. <br />        <br />I suppose the theory is still speculation, and I am not sure <br />that it actually adds that much to the picture of the causes of evil that we have already.  <br />But the book makes it plausible that evil was not cured by doctor, but made worse by a doctor. <br />Thats pretty stunning stuff. <br /> <br />-Simon	2004-10-17

However, if the US (or any other country) were to go to war with every regime that told lies or behaved badly, there would be nothing but war.<br />  In Bob Woodwards new book (Plan of Attack) we get the inside on why President Bush launched an attack on Iraq to topple Saddam and occupy Iraq.<br />  And as the news from Iraq gets ever more muddy Woodwards book is a brilliant and necessary recapitulation on why and how the invasion of Iraq happened.<br />  When Bush moved into the White House CIA director Tenet had listed three major threats to American National security: a) The Al Qaeda terror network of Osama Bin Laden working out of Afghanistan. b) The increasing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and finally c) the rise of China (especially its military), but that problem was 5 to 15 years away, whereas the others were immediate concerns.<br />  British secret intelligence service, MI6, passed on the results of 2001 operations in Pakistan, were it became abundantly clear that nuclear technology were being sold to the likes of Iran, North Korea and Libya. And obviously nukes in the hands of Al Qaeda could take out London or New York.<br /><br />  Certainly, that would seem like more than enough problems to deal with for most people. But in Woodwards account we see how Iraq enters the equation as yet another major problem to be dealt with.<br />  From the highly personal level, where Bush complains that Saddam tried to kill his dad - a reference to the 1993 plot to assassinate Bush senior on a trip to the Middle East, which failed and ended with president Clinton ordering a cruise missile attack on Baghdad - to the intelligence reports that Iraq would have nuclear weapons by 2007 to 2009, Woodward takes us through the events that led to the conclusion that Saddam had to be removed.<br />  Currently, there is much talk in the news about the fact that WMD was never found in Iraq by the Hans Blix U.N. team, nor by coalition forces, but following Woodwards account the worry was originally as least as much on future production as on present weapons. Once the threat of war was lifted Saddam had hundreds of millions of dollars, billions, to buy WMD. And Saddam had a complete weapons programs, including the scientists for the job. And worst of all, Saddam had demonstrated before that armed with WMD he didn't hesitate to use them.<br />  And Bush were not alone in finding this troublesome: Among those who agreed with Bush we find Elie Wiesel, survivor of Auschwitz, who came on his own initiative to see Bush and tell the president that Iraq was a terrorist state and that the moral imperative was for intervention. 79 year old Henry Kissenger came to see Condoleezza Rice and tell her to invade etc.<br />  The only thing I find missing in Woodwards account is the concern around the world of the &quot;Pax Americana&quot;, where the U.N. is as meaningless as the League of Nations were. The end of the cold war meant the dramatic spread of liberty to many eastern block countries. The idea of democracy and liberty in the Middle East is probably to radical for most people to understand - but Woodward just take this as the Bush position, and never goes into a deeper discussion of what this actually means and why people around the world might be sceptical.<br />  Certainly, Bush is now on the Al Quada hit list, but what history will say is not Woodwards business, nor Bushs.

Death<br />and mayhem follows.<br />  Here nanotechnology is the new cool technology.<br />The mistake is putting your designer organisms<br />out in the wild, free to breed and evolve.<br />  So, the plot is pretty predictable,<br />but somehow it doesn't matter as suspense builds.<br />Finally, you do become desperate to know how our hero<br />is going to make it out of the mess.<br />  Its all so believable: Surely, nano organisms designed<br />by humans are just waiting to happen.<br />And surely, they will by accident be released<br />into the wild.<br /><br />  Making us believe this isn't hard, but there<br />is more than just one dumb nano robot in the<br />Crichton plot. Actually there are a whole lot of<br />nano robots! And they are not dumb, as they coordinate<br />their intelligence in a swarm.<br />Working together to accomplish some goal.<br />  Each robot programmed to follow simple rules,<br />but with emergent clever behaviour at the swarm level.<br />Really, really clever swarm behaviour.<br />  But, Ok, as things gets more complex, and more<br />scary, there are a lot of weak links in Crichtons chain<br />of reasoning. But what did you expect? Afterall, it<br />is a work of fiction!<br />  Pretty good work I would say.<br />-Simon	2003-11-02

According to Michael Moore, Oprah would definitely be<br />the better candidate, if she was to race against<br />the current incumbent. And might actually win!<br />  So we should be prepared for a black woman<br />as US president!<br />  And this is what the book is all about.<br />Simply, it is worth reading for its many good<br />points and thought provoking conclusions.<br />Points we ought to have debated in upcoming elections.<br />  One of Moores best points is when he identifies<br />fear as a problem in our political decision making.<br />As Roosevelt said, we have nothing to fear but fear<br />itself.<br />  Surely, without fear - political decisions<br />could be much better and much more future oriented.<br />  However, Moore never convinces this reader that<br />there isn't a lot to be fearful about in the world.<br />To me, the kind of unilateral US disarmament Moore<br />advocates will not bring security, rather the rise of<br />something much worse than anything Moore<br />can say about the US.<br />  But surely, Moore is correct in saying that we must<br />control our fears in order to ask the right questions<br />and figure out what our world should look like.<br />  When fifteen out of the nineteen hijackers in<br />the 9-11 attack are Saudis - and they are led by a<br />Saudi multimillionaire - Moore is correct to ask<br />why Saudi Arabia weren't invaded.<br />  Surely, the reason is not that the Saudi regime<br />is a shinning example of freedom and democracy.<br />Instead their 1 trillion dollar investment in the<br />US stock market and another trillion in US banks<br />might kind of cloud our judgement concerning<br />their country.<br />  So, instead Iraq was invaded.<br />  Moore thinks this is all bad. But to me,<br />making the West less dependant on the royal Saudi<br />family nearly seems reason enough for going to war.<br />Anyhow, the arguments should be out there in the open.<br />  When stockprizes for many companies dropped 75 percent<br />or more between 1999 and 2002, obviously a lot<br />of executives had long ago dumped their own stocks,<br />while the average person were told by CNBC<br />to buy and hold out.<br />  Ultimately securing a massive transfer of<br />wealth from one group (the averages Joes) to another<br />(the CEOs of this world).<br />  Obviously, Moore rightly isn't to fond about<br />this kind of behaviour.<br />  And it is not surprising that such things happen when<br />greed and fear (of being left behind) controls<br />our behaviour.<br /><br />  So, all in all there are a lot of points to<br />discuss in the upcoming elections. Realistically,<br />Moore hopes for a Clark candidacy to do this.<br />And indeed gen. Wesley K. Clark himself has stated<br />that he wants to foster a national dialogue about<br />Americas future.<br />  And this is what democracy is all about -<br />debating the issues.<br />  Reading Michael Moores book is a start.<br />-Simon1999 and 2002, obviously a lot<BR>of executives had long ago dumped their own stocks, <BR>while the average person were told by CNBC <BR>to buy and hold out.<BR>   Ultimately securing a massive transfer of <BR>wealth from one group (the averages Joes) to another <BR>(the CEOs of this world).<BR>   Obviously, Moore rightly isn't to fond about <BR>this kind of behaviour.<BR>   And it is not surprising that such things happen when<BR>greed and fear (of being left behind) controls<BR>our behaviour.<BR>  <BR>   So, all in all there are a lot of points to <BR>discuss in the upcoming elections.

Books	4	8	16	N	N	To be a citizen	To be a citizen is the highest honor to hold in<br />a democracy. You might agree or you might disagree<br />with Moore, but I don't think you can take away from<br />him that he actually cares about democracy and society.<br /> In our times of subversive materialism Moores<br />idealism and pamphleteer kicking style is obviously necessary.<br />We all need to get involved in this thing called<br />society.<br /> With this said I personally disagree with Moore<br />on a lot of issues. The part about Yugoslavia was<br />simplistic, to say it mildly, his failure to see<br />any good in Americas position in the world is<br />downright dangerous.<br /> On the bright side I kind of enjoyed his comparison of<br />high schools with totalitarian dictatorships etc.<br />  So, despite all the singlemindedness in this book, democracy<br />needs people like Michael Moore.

It not only<br />brings back the life of John Adams, it<br />also brings back the American revolution.<br />A revolution that happened because some,<br />like Adams, were dedicated to its ideals.<br />When townspeople asked for a toast that<br />they might read out aload on the 4th of July, the 90<br />year old former president declared in true blue spirits<br />that it should be &quot;Independence forever&quot;. No less,<br />no more.<br />But David McCullochs story of John Adams is great,<br />because it is a story of a real<br />person. A mensch, as germans would put it.<br />Born into the times of the american revolution<br />he prized the Roman ideal of honor. He read<br />Cicero, Tacitus and others in Latin. Plato<br />in the original Greek. Indeed, something to consider<br />for your 2003 politician who considers CNN a source<br />of information.<br />He was not a man of wealth - but he loved<br />the esteem of public life and his farm, family<br />and goose quill. And above all, it seems,<br />his wife.<br />Whom he married on october 1764 at the home of the<br />prides parents in Weymouth Massachusetts.<br />He was 28 and Abigail Smith was 19.<br />And through thick and thin we follow them<br />though these epic times of the American revolution.<br />As they cross the Atlantic and don't expect to survive<br />it - right till the end when Abigail dies in 1818.<br />A marriage that in itself would be worthy of a book -<br />in all its trials, love, wisdom and humanity.<br />Indeed, Abigail surely deserves a biography<br />dedicated solely to her.<br />At times Adams would wrestle with fellow<br />founders.<br />Benjamin Franklin called him: Sometimes out<br />of his senses. And Thomas Jefferson was both a<br />lifelong friend and a bitter political opponent,<br />who accused him of monarchistic tendencies<br />in the hard fought election of 1800.<br />And it was not &quot;just&quot; politics to Adams. Indeed,<br />Whereas God, according to Jefferson, created the<br />universe and then withdrem from mundane affairs,<br />Adams believed in continous divine intervention.<br />So to John Adams it was never just a puppet game<br />- it was a question of giving providence<br />a helping hand.<br />And providence certainly had a helping hand in securing<br />that the two surviving heroes of the 1776<br />revolution both died on the 4th of July.<br />July 4th 1826 -<br />Jefferson a few hours before Adams.<br />A wonderful story.

But still we are different.<br />According to Susan Blackmore thats because we are<br />capable of imitation. We can thereby copy ideas,<br />habits,inventions, songs and stories. I.e. memes.<br />And now memes are as powerful, if not more powerful,<br />than the good old genes, in directing human evolution.<br />  I find the idea intriguing, and certainly<br />Susan Blackmore argue well for the idea.<br />  The (evolutionary) pressure for imitation skills<br />requires big brains. So we evolve big brains, as people<br />mate with the ones with the most memes.<br />Language is invented in order to spread memes.<br />Film stars, journalists, writers, singers,<br />politicians and artists become the most<br />attractive, as they are the ones who spread the<br />most memes.<br />  Things that are hard to explain in a genetic<br />context (such as adoption, birth control, celibacy) are<br />easy to explain in a meme context<br />(the memes are happy with it, as it help spread<br />more memes).<br />  Science becomes a process to distinguish<br />true memes from false memes. Fax-machines, telephones,<br />etc. are created (by the memes) in order to spread more<br />memes. Writing is a battleground in the head between<br />memes wanting to be spread.<br />  etc.<br />  It all rings true to me.<br />Except Susan Blackmores claim that the self<br />is a complex meme. Certainly it is puzzling<br />that blind people are reported thinking that their<br />&quot;I&quot; is located at their fingertips, when they<br />read Braille.<br />  Still there are other explanations to what<br />a human &quot;I&quot; is than memes.

Like Damasio, I never believed it when people told me that language produces the conscious mind.  Following Damasio's line of thought is  actually a lot easier. His central idea, that our  sense of self arises from our need to map >relations between the self and other objects, is thoroughly explained in the book.  He backs it with numerous medical case stories,<br />where some are a bit unsettling. After all we are talking about real people here, real people with some serious problems. His model of consciousness works like Lego bricks, where his notions of proto-self, core-self,  autobiographical-self etc. gives a very credible account of what is going on.  Surely, one could think that consciousness is way  to complex to begin to describe -  but here you actually get some valuable insights without being thrown into the all to popular explanations!<br /> The vital points begins to sink in, when they are explained from different angles. Still it is not an entirely trivial matter to state something like:  Core self is created out of nowhere in the account where an organism is caught in he act of representing its own changing state, as it goes about representing something else.<br />  But Damasio gets away it, and in the end you tend to believe him. It is really a wonderful book about a difficult and extremely interesting subject. A major work that you are really happy to have read.<br /><br />-Simon	2002-05-21

One might meet historical persons<br />and interact with them (in another universe),<br />but such universe will not evolve into the universe we<br />know - so no paradox.<br />  Out there in the mindblowing array of parallel universes,<br />that make up the multiverse, Virtual Reality generators<br />of increasing sophistication exists. Including some that<br />can mimic any part of the multiverse.<br />  If reality was not slippery before, certainly<br />it is after reading this book!<br />  The grand finale is Frank Tiplers Omega Point Theory,<br />where extreme cosmological scenarios makes settings<br />possible where one can perform unlimited computations<br />in a limited time. Beings here might resurrect the dead (us)<br />in Virtual Reality renderings for their own amusement -<br />Or they might embark upon the solution of tremendous<br />problems creating still more awesome scenarios.<br />  The book seems to be saying, that somewhere out<br />there in the multiverse, someone will necessarily<br />succeed in making a Omega Point spacetime.<br />  Awesome perspectives in an awesome book.<br />And a fun read.<br />-Simonios.<br />   The book seems to be saying, that somewhere out <BR>there in the multiverse, someone will necessarily<BR>succeed in making a Omega Point spacetime.<BR>    Awesome perspectives in an awesome book.<BR>And a fun read.<br />-Simon	2002-05-11

In Kurzwells words:&quot;Within 100 years there  will be a strong trend toward the merger of human thinking with the world of machine intelligence. Most conscious entities will end up having no permanant physical presence&quot;.<br />Starting from Moores law of ever more powerful computers, Kurzweil takes us through the steps towards the big upload, where human brains are scanned and uploaded as software to conscious computers. Starting with direct neural pathways for  high bandwidth connections between the human brain and intelligent computers - the final step where the brain is moved inside the computer wont seem so immense. And obviously everybody will want the  to take the steps before, where perception and  interpretation are enhanced, as well as memory and reasoning etc.<br />Kurzweil quotes Arthur C.

When he states  that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong&quot;.<br />If I wasn't convinced before - I am now, after reading Kurzweils book - we are  just waiting for the upload !

This brings you to the concept of &quot;truth&quot;.  Actually, the books conveys a picture  where the only difference between physicists  and novelists is that the physicist thinks that his<br />story might actually be true.  Where a physicist spends his time seeking  out physical models of already discovered  mathematical structures hoping that they comply  with experiment.  Reality ? Who knows, seems to be the message.  Perhaps thats the truth ?  Along the road towards this &quot;clarification&quot; comes a lot of very exciting thought experiments. Where Gribbin twists the standard interpretations just a little to give you a new insight.  I particular enjoyed one about special relativity, Where Gribbin twists it one step further than usual and comes up with a logical consequence of the standard Lorentz transformation:  How does time flow  for a photon?  Answer: It doesn't !  According to the standard Lorentz  contraction the space interval between two objects does not exist for a photon. And so, from the point of view of the photon, it takes no time to travel this distance.

So, as inspiration I found the book  a good read - But I don't particular believe all of Penroses arguments. Especially the part about that our brains can't be modeled by computational systems and hence that strong artificial intelligence  will remain in science fiction was to me unconvincing.<br />-Simon	2001-05-11

When you have probabilistic doomsday  predictions, intelligent squids,  Feynman radios (to pick up signals from the future) etc. -  thrown at you, it could easily have been just  a lot of weird stuff that seemed pretty far removed from anything you could relate to.  Not so in Stephen  Baxters &quot;time&quot;. Here it all seems pretty logical and inevitable.  Surely, some future Malenfant guy will genetically enhance a squid brain, and then let the squid control a spaceship instead of some old computer. And surely the squid will rebel and try to get back to Earth with its giant Oceans and lots of room to breed....  Brilliant stuff and thats just just the prelude!  I read all 456 pages in one session. Simply I just had to know what would happen next....	2001-04-25

Authors David Koerner and Simon LeVay certainly convey this feeling in their wide-ranging  overview of the search for ETs in the universe.  Even in our solar system life might exist outside Earth.  Europa, one of the moons of Jupitor,  might possess an icecovered ocean. With all the right ingredients for life down in a dark ocean. Another likely candidate is the Saturn moon Titan. Even though it seems a pretty cold  place at minus 178 degress Celcius. In its atmosphere one is likely to find amino acids, nucleotide bases  and many other building blocks of life.  All of which is thoroughly described by  Koerner and Levay in an easy and engaging way.<br />  And surely a lot of the other stars must have  planets. In a little  treat of a chapter authors  Koerner and Levay makes the case for stars with planets. Some of them with life on them.  That is life as we know it. Still a number of other  possibilities (infinite ?) exists.<br />  Without goning into the details of the examples in the book - one possibility in particular excites me. And I think they should  have dwelled more on it than they actually do:  Take life on an neutron star. A neutron star is the superdense remnant of a supernova explosion. The original star collapses to a state were gravity  overcomes repulsion between electrons and protons. They then fuses forming a sea of neutrons. Life there could exists as patterns of bounded neutrons. With a breakneck speed of metabolism. Where organism live and die within 10e-15 seconds. Entire  civilisations might be formed within a fraction of  second.  Advanced civilisation might create such neutron stars in order to use them as computers. Some 10e30  time more powerful than the human brain.  The authors regrettablely stops here -  I think it could be relevant to speculate  further on installing computers in spacetime itself,  just taking the neutron star example one step further to a black hole, that explodes into a new universe (big bang) with the order  (computer) installed in its very  fabric of space time.<br />  Still the book &quot;Here be dragons&quot; is highly  recomended as it takes on all the  interesting questions: Who are we ? Where do we come from ? Are we alone ? and let you in on the detective story of finding some answers.  -Simonblack hole, that explodes into a new universe (big bang) with the order  (computer) installed in its very  fabric of space time.<br />    Still the book &quot;Here be dragons&quot; is highly  recomended as it takes on all the  interesting questions: Who are we ?

Michael Chrichton certainly has a talent for making the impossible come true.  In Jurassic Park he expanded a bit on current gene technology and out came living breathing  dinosaurs. In Timeline quantum mechanics is  stretched a little bit and out comes timetravel.<br />  His opening remarks are especially clever:  &quot;..at the dawn of the nineteen century psysicists  thought they knew the overall laws of the universe.  Only details needed to be filled out&quot;.  How naive they were,we think. And by thinking that we enter a world were everything  is possible in the future.  We end up agreeing with Crichton that it will be possible to make a person disapear from  our universe and reappear in another part of  the multiverse (that looks very much like our own) were the clock says France, 1375.  In the book it is stated as: ITC Corp. has invented  a way, using Quantum Physics,  to journey to 14th  century France.  It's not really a time machine  since instead of going back to our past,  the characters are actually going back to a  past that exists in a parallel universe.  What saves the day for Crichton is his grasp of  (selfevident) details (like obvisously: &quot;it is very  quiet in 1375 as there are no machines to make noises&quot;). The details surprises you and fills the cracks in the wall for you.  Without the details an d Crichtons story  telling skills you would otherwise have protested  that this was to far fetched.<br />  And as usual I am looking forward to the  inevitable movie. In the meantime,  I enjoyed the book very much. And certainly I agree with the tone of the whole thing - in the future everything is possible.	2001-02-25

I think Seymour Hersh, in the book &quot;The dark side of  Camelot&quot;, has given more than just hints  that the Kennedy presidency came about as the  result of vote fraud.  And it continued in cooperation with the Mafia  to be involved in almost all sorts of illegal activity.  But more than that, it once again gives an insight  into the Kennedy family morales, or more precisely,  lack of morales.  How Jack Kennedy could ever become president strikes me as odd to say the least.  Below I have collected some issues raised in  the Hersh book. It should be rather easy for the  Kennedy family to put out there own true story  of what went on -- If not there was some truth in  all of this.  At least Nigel Hamiltons &quot;JFK, reckless youth&quot;  hinted in the same disturbing direction.  It is just so easy to scream &quot;tabloid trash&quot; without having read the book.  Read the book !!!<br />  ------------  1. Jack Kennedys grandfather: Honey Fitz of Boston  -  was unseated by the house of Representatives  for vote fraud in 1919. He offered no defense other than the OJ stand  &quot;I've been framed&quot;.  His opponent was sworn in instead. ---  2. Joseph Kennedy left nothing to chance in his drive  to have his son elected to high office.  In Jacks first campaign in 1946  hundred of thousands was poured into the campign  for a congressional seat. The platform was extremely vague:  &quot;The next generation offers a leader&quot;  instead primary rivals were paid $7500 to stay out  of the race, others were paid to join to  split votes in key districts. ---  3. During prohibition Joe Kennedy had made a fortune  in the bootlegging industri.  Working hand in hand with organized crime,  if not being a made member of the mafia. According to Frank Costello,  the most powerful mafia boss of the 40s and 50s,  he and Joe kennedy had been partners in the bootleg  industri during prohibition. ---  4. Joe Kennedy was appointed ambassadour<br />to Britain and had hoped to become american president  himself. Unfortunately for him he didnt  understood morale issues at all.  So he had assumed that people would not fight Nazism,  if it did cost them anything.  He surely wouldnt. Besides,  he had anti semitic feelings himself and could sympathize  with much of the goings ons in Germany. ---  5. In the 1960 presidential election  there were vote fraud in 11 states.  Here Kennedy had bought the election  with the help of the mafia.  Afterwards official investigations either never  got under way, or was stopped by grossly  partisan democratic judges. The planning of the fraud  was carried out after meetings between  Joe Kennedy and Sam Giancana, head of the illinois mafia.  Interestingly enough they felt most secure when meeting  in couthouses belonging to judges owing favours.  ---  6. For a period in the JFK presidency  communication between the Kennedys and Sam Giancana  (Chicago mafia) was done through a shared mistress,  Judith Cambell Exner. ---  7. In the public Kennedy was portrayed  as working hard and long hours for his country.  In reality a good deal of his presidency  was spend in various orgies. On an ordinary day Jack Kennedy  would take lunch in the White House pool  with &quot;secretaries&quot; Fiddle and Faddle.  And have sex with prostitutes or starlettes  in the evening. ---  8. Jack won the pulitzer prize for the book  &quot;profiles in courage&quot;. It is certain that Joe helped  it make the bestseller list by buying up large  numbers himself. Probably the book wasnt even  written by Kennedy, but by a ghostwriter.  Even though Kennedy knew its content.ped to become american president  himself.

Back in 1942 Isaac Asimov started the foundations  series - and the future took shape. In 1999 we got book number 10.  The third in the second foundation  Foundation trilogy. - and it is as great as ever !<br />Hugo and Nebula award winner David Brin seems  to be the man to continue the saga !<br />--------<br />According to psychohistory a tiny colony of  mathematicians and psychologists, the Foundation,  should take over when the old  empire crumples and dies.<br />Unfortunately, pertubations will nudge  the psychohistorical parameters  - knocking the Seldon plan off course. For that purpose a shadowy elite of &quot;demigods&quot;  is set up to protect the plan.  And beyond all that yet another  layer for the future of humanity.<br />The plan set up by R. Daneel Olivaw.  A plan that uses the other plans to  buy time before this master plan can come into effect. In the Olivaw master plan humanity is  changed into a GAIA like structure called the Galaxia superorganism - Every human soul in  contact with every other one.  All knowledge shared instantly.  All misunderstandings erased.  All unified into the vast unified web.<br />But there are snakes in paradise : &quot;..... that is the essential horror of the  Zeroth law, serve abstract humnity while  allowing trillions of real people to die...&quot;,  said R. Lodovic.<br />The real reason the empire is falling  is because you, Daneel,  wants to get rid of the Galactic bureaucracy.  - the grey class. No small meddlers to  interfere with Olivaw's masterplan  that turns humanity into Galaxia.<br />And in the end Brin even tells us what it all ends with.

Tiedemann's Mirage is a fairly complex SF novel. Corporate and political conspiracy behind the slaughter of diplomats for the advancement of some hidden agenda.<br />There are some pretty good dialoque and ideas  floating around. I especially enjoyed the  ones like : &quot;The Church of organic Sapiens extended the belief into the religious,  claiming that the true nature of humankind  was pretechnological,  that Eden had contained no machines.&quot;<br />However to really follow in the footsteps of  master Asimov the historical import into this  setting should have been easier to follow.  What is the context of this corporate and political conspiracy.  Where are we headed ? What did this mean to galactic history ?  The shift in interstellar policy should have had a similar feel to the climaxes in the original stories. But I don't think they have -  or if so, I didn't get it ?<br />The Asimov universe has been respectfully added  to since  Asimovs death -  Compare Mirage with e.g. the Second Foundation Trilogy, especially the novel by Hugo and Nebula award  winner David Brin. I simply think Mirage falls short. David Brin adds to the universe,  explains and pushes us forward. Here the grand scale of things isn't as pinned out,  Are we waiting for enlightment in a coming novel ? I don't know. But I do know that Asimov balanced complexity with a simplicity that I somehow miss here. Parts of the plot is a bit to ambiguous for my taste.  Still it has its good spells also.	2001-02-04

I loved the portrait of a charming,  ambitious, amoral young Southerner -  Jack Stanton AKA Bill Clinton -, on his way to the White House - as given  by Joe Klein in &quot;Primary Colors&quot;. So I obviously bought &quot;the  Running Mate&quot;:<br />Politics isn't about policies,  it's about  artful  Machiavellian maneuvers,  backstabbing, and feeding scandals to the  press.<br />  So far, so good :-)<br />  Joe Kleins hero is a democrat, so what  are the values that is lost when &quot;our&quot; hero loses (to a political  opponent - Republican - who has no scruples) ?  I don't really think the  &quot;Running Mate&quot; tells us, but of course we know - it is those  liberal values your High School teacher loved ???<br />A) Human worth is  intrinsic and doesn't depend on  success or power.<br />B) All human conflict  and striefe between human beings can be ended whether by political  revolution,  social change or better education.<br />C) All inequalities are  due to discrimination, prejudice, oppression or social conditioning.<br />D)  You should stand by the traditional values of the left  by being on the  side of the weak, poor and oppressed.<br />  ???<br />  Obviously the slime  Jack Stanton (AKA Bill Clinton) did terrible things to this agenda by  totally confusing what  it is all about (drowning it in slime).  So now  we have a hero, Charlie Martin, who should  be able to fight for the cause.  He is supposedly honest and &quot;good&quot; - and his opponents are  not. Whether they are Comcon - compassionate conservatives, who preach that  abortion is murder, while their own wifes have them performed quietly - or  they are democrats like scumbag Jack Stanton - it doesn't really matter -  they  are all scum in this universe. - And it is a delight to read  about  :-)<br /> But as Joe Klein doesn't really tell all that much about  &quot;our&quot; heroes political agenda (I assume it to be as stated above)  - I somehow come to think that our hero senator might have these values,  but it doesn't really mean that damn much to him. - And then, in my book,  he must be a scumbag as well.<br />Even though I don't agree with such a  traditional  left world view - I can respect if it is &quot;felt&quot;  deeply. I can't respect it, if is only kind of half thought  through and  taken on because it makes for a good career (Jack Stanton like) - and  perhaps because it gives you an alibi as a human.<br />But, to Joe Klein  senator Martin is a hero.<br />  When his opponent runs &quot;oppo&quot; on  him - We, the readers, are told the inside story to this and is appaled  that the opponent can do a thing like that. And tired about this a part of  political life - somehow we are already betting with ourselfes on what the  scandals are going to be in the nonfictional presidential  campaign of  autumn 2000, Bush vs. Gore.<br />Still does it really make senator Martin a  hero  to suffer attacks of this kind ? To loose to an opponent who uses  such tactics ? Does it make the senator  a hero that he finally cares about  having a family and  plans to gets married  (BTW. - is that why the book is  called the running mate ?)<br />  ???<br />  Ok, it makes a hero to overcome  trouble, But in politics you should also be about something.
