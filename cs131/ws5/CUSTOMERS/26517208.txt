But the deal has an outrageous condition - marriage to the notorious Estrella Medrano! Ram&oacute;n won't be forced into anything, least of all a wedding with a scarlet woman!<br /><br />But Estrella is not what he thought. Ram&oacute;n can't get her gorgeous body out of his mind. He even starts to believe she may not deserve her reputation! A marriage of convenience - and desire - might be a good deal after all....<br /><br />My review - Estrella is in the unenviable position of having one man after another bribed by her father to marry her - she has the task of convincing them she doesn't want to wed them - each time her father puts more pressure on her.  Ramon is the tenth man he tries to bribe.  Passion flares between them, but Ramon treats Estrella with contempt because he, like everyone else, has heard the story of how she stole an older man away from his wife and children & ran off with him.  The man died a week later in a car accident, but Estrella has not been able to escape the scandal or her fathers censure.  No one has ever asked to hear her side of the story, and it appears that Ramon is no different.<br /><br />Estrella visits Ramon and passion flares out of control - she offers to marry him so he can get the tv station and she can get her father off her back - she tells him that they can divorce later.  They end up on bed making love all night.  In the morning, Ramon surprises her by telling her that he still isn't interested in wedding a woman like her.  She leaves his house heartbroken - feeling cheap.<br /><br />Ramon cannot get her out of his mind, he thinks about her and their night together constantly until he can't take it anymore and decides to visit her.  He ends up dropping in a dinner party with her, her father, and bachelor number eleven - an old, fat, short man with a good reputation who Estrella's father has told her she will have to marry or be cast out into the street.  Ramon takes the scene in and understands whats going on - he sees the shadows under Estrella's eyes and how miserable she is and he impulsively announces to her father that they are going to marry & that he asked her to keep it a secret until they could tell him together.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD - They marry, they make mad passionate love & both come to feel a lot more than lust for each other, but suspect that their love is in vain.  Estrella shows Ramon a marriage certificate from years ago - the man who turned her into a scarlet woman pretended he was single and committed bigamy to fake marry her and get her into bed.  He is devastated to learn that he misjudged her so badly - it is a great read.

Back Cover - That's the sizzling premise behind the Fantasy Weekend Contest at the Hush Hotel in Manhatten.  PR director Kit Prescott has outdone herself promoting a hotel catering to the senses -- until she welcomes the first winner.  Sexy, single Peter Garson has checked into the Carnaby Suite -- the same man who checked out prematurely from their wedding three years ago!!<br /><br />Peter will do anything to win Kit back, including penning all his fantasies and feelings on paper for her to see -- and experience nightly in the confines of his king-size bed.  His touch brings so many memories -- good and bad -- flooding back.  But can he and Kit separate fantasy from reality once the weekend is over?<br /><br />Excerpt:<br /><br />Welcome to the Hush Hotel!  Check out the couple in room 1864....<br /><br />\\"Touch me,\\" Kit whispered, straddling his lap.<br /><br />Peter didn't have to be asked twice.  He reached for her breasts, tracing the shape of them though the silk, loving the textures, the nipples pebbling against his fingertips.<br /><br />He pictured her lushly painted mouth as he murmured, \\"What will happen next?\\"<br /><br />Paper crackeled.  \\"Will She let me love her?\\"  Ger voice was low and sexy as she read.  \\"I don't know.  It's her choice.  Her decision.\\"  He heard his own words written for the fantasy contest, though she'd added a few of her own.<br /><br />He hadn't realized how intense his need would be with the woman he was in love with -- had loved forever -- splayed across his lap.<br /><br />Kit kissed him suddenly, and the shock of her lips, glossy and wet, felt like his first kiss ever.<br /><br />\\"Let me love you,\\" he gasped. \\"Now.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes....\\"<br /><br />There was no way the chair could hold them, what with the two of them tearing at each other's clothes.  They tumbled off and onto the floor -- the plush, deeply carpeted, made-for-rolling-around-having-wild-sex floor.<br /><br />I honestly don't know if I could have forgiven Peter if I was Kit - this book is really emotional - it has great sex scenes, but it also goes into a lot of detail about how Kit felt the day she stood at the front of a church in front of 200 friends and relatives, dressed as a beautiful bride and waited for the man she loved who never showed up.  He finally sent her a short not saying that he was sorry he hurt her and that he hoped she could forgive him one day with a check to her parents for the cost of the wedding.  I cried when I read the part where she told him how it felt.  I know he was sorry, but I just don't know if you can ever be sorry enough for something like that.  He did do everything in his power to woo her and win her back, but in the end, when she had a chance to get payback for everything that happened three years before or take a chance on happiness - I wasn't absolutely sure what I would have done.  This is a really good book - it gets you thinking, but it still has all the hot love scenes we have come to expect from Blaze - I highly recommend it.ail about how Kit felt the day she stood at the front of a church in front of 200 friends and relatives, dressed as a beautiful bride and waited for the man she loved who never showed up.

In fact, it seems that her bedroom skills have the ability to make men.....ill! The only solution -- for her sanity and the safety of mankind -- is to swear off dating.  Then she meets Jack Langston -- charming, sexy and persuasive enough for two guys -- and her vow is out the window.  Before she knows it, he's swept her off her feet and straight into his bed.  Their adventures between the sheets are hot, thrilling....and leave Jack in perfect health.  What better sign could Erin have that they are meant to be?  That is, until she finds out about Jack's little secret.....<br /><br />Excerpt -- Erin had sworn off men...although, at this moment with her palm against Jack's hard, warm chest, for the life of her she couldn't remember why.  Moving her hand in small circles, she worked her way along his torso, her pulse thudding as she traced his firm muscles.  Desire flowed through her and she swallowed as he rolled back his head and a small moan of pleasure sounded from his throat.<br /><br />It wasn't enough.  She had to touch him.<br /><br />With quick twists of her fingers she undid his shirt, then laid her hands on his skin, hardly believing she could be so bold.  Where was that resolve to remain single?  Nowhere in sight.<br /><br />His gaze fell to her mouth and she could feel him fighting the urge to kiss her.  She struggled herself.  In that moment there wasn't anything that made sense in the world but joining her mouth to his.  She pressed her lips to his, where she paused for just a heartbeat while their breath mixed, the warmth and excitement and anticipation almost unbearable.<br /><br />So much for swearing off men.<br /><br />Here's what the back cover doesn't tell you - WARNING - somewhat of a SPOILER alert - Jack has a heart condition - he sought Erin out because he had heard of her sisters and knew that they and her mother had the gift of sexual healing.  When he talks to her and realizes how she feels about all that & that she doesn't believe in it, he decides not to tell her why he came looking for her & he hires her to redecorate his house.  They become lovers & he gets sick, like all the men in her past, but he keeps it from her.  She finally figures out that she does have the gift - maybe even stronger than her sisters - it just manifests itself in a different way.  She is emotionally destroyed when she finds out that Jack sought her out intending to use her for the gift, but she loves him anyway.  Towards the end of the book, while they aren't getting along & she won't see him for fear of making him sick, his heart problems come back worse than before he started seeing her and he has a minor heart attack.  Soon, he is scheduled to have open heart surgery - the same surgery his sister died from when they were younger.  This is a really emotional book - the sex scenes are very hot - because of Erin's gift, she can feel what they person she loves feels, so the sex it that much more intense.  It is great to see how it all plays out and how Erin comes to accept her place in her wacky but loving family.

As the headline to my review says, Evan's story is the best one.  All of the stories are good, but his and Arabella's is the best.  Typical DP story - the heroine is a younger virginal type and the hero is 15 years older than her and only dates experienced women.  He makes a big deal out of her being younger and being innocent because he had a bad experience with a virginal girlfriend accusing him of hurting her when he was younger.  He is a big man (though only 6'4\\", I think), so he feels like he has to be in control when he is with a woman.  Arabella scares him because she makes him feel like no other woman ever has.  He is cruel to her to try to get her to back off, but when she gets engaged to a young doctor, he realizes he loves her and will do whatever it takes to get her back - even overcome his hangups!!<br /><br />Donovan's story is good, too.  He moved off from the ranch he and his brothers own after losing his wife.  He is working for the heroine, Pepi's father.  He has a habit of getting drunk to erase his painful memories and Pepi always has to get him out of scrapes and take care of him.  During one of these drunken episodes, he insists that they marry at a Mexican chapel.  The next day he doesn't remember and Pepi is scared to tell him.  When he finds out, he is madder than h@ll, but eventually forgives her and falls in love.<br /><br />Harden is a hardhearted soul - he can't forgive his mother because she left her husband for a while and had him with another man - so,  he is the middle child but doesn't have the same father as Evan and Donovan.  He treats all women bad because of this and treats his mother the worst of all.  The heroine changes his opinion of women overall and helps him heal his relationship with his mother.	2005-07-26

In fact, her response to this giant of a man was very old-fashioned, indeed.  She didn't care about being a perfect woman, but she longed to be the woman for him.	2005-07-15

Tomas Carlisle is one of three brothers whose father recently died.  One of them has to have a baby within the next 12 months to keep ownership of the family cattle stations and holdings located in the Australian Outback.  Tomas's wife was killed in an accident a few years ago and his emotions have been frozen since then - he doesn't want anything to do with any woman but is determined to do his part to fulfill the terms of the will.  When his childhood friend, Angelina Mori offers to have his baby, he refuses because she will only have it the old-fashioned way (he wants her to have it through invitro fertilization, so he won't have to touch her in any way - he is still faithful to his dead wife's memory), but he reconsiders when he thinks she may sleep with one of his brothers to help them have a baby.  What he doesn't know is that Angelina has been in love with him since she can remember.  Her heart was broken on her 18th birthday when he didn't even notice that she was dressed up for him, but fell in love at first sight with her best friend (the woman who he would eventually marry) instead.  Angelina even tried to talk him out of the marriage by telling him that she honestly didn't think her friend was cut out to live the outback lifestyle (turns out she was right).  This only made him mad, so she did the only thing she could - went on an extended trip abroad to avoid the heartache of being a bridesmaid in their wedding.  Now, she is searching for a way to melt the ice around his heart and bring him back to the land of the living - hoping against hope that he will accept the gift of her baby and her heart this time.  You will almost cry when you read some of the cold hearted ways Tomas treats her to let her know that what they have between them is just sex for the sake of having a baby - making sure to push her away and not let her get close emotionally.  By the end, he starts to realize that he doesn't want to let this chance at happiness go, but he isn't sure that it's not too late.

Back Cover - An American Dream - Her dazzling beauty lit up the neon nights.  An American aristocrat, she sprang from wealth and timeless tradition. Girl of the Year, Youthquaker, her unique, evanescent image leapt from the pages of Vogue to inspire a generation.  An American Tragedy - She was going where the action was.  Society's darling, she became Warhol's Superstar, Queen of the Underground Art and Fashion World.  She was everything we wanted to be at a moment when all the rules were being broken - when it was everything to be young and beautiful and free.  Then the lights began to dim, the nights turned dark, and she became a legend - the legend of a darkly troubled time.  Dead at 28 of a barbiturate overdose.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book - it is the story of Edie Sedgewick's life told in a series of interviews with people she knew.  Edie lived during the 60's & was one of Andy Warhol's protegees - she starred in several of the low budget films he made at the factory.  She also dated Bob Dillon at one time.

But after a recent embarrassing encounter, he was afraid to have anything to do with them. Until Tina Deluca, with her sweet innocent face and curvaceous body, walked into his life.

They tried to take it slowly, but soon touching turned to kissing, and kissing turned to tasting...and Tyler realized he was in over his head.<br /><br />Was he finally ready to offer his heart - and his body - to love?<br /><br />An Excerpt From...<br /><br />Bedroom Secrets<br /><br />by Michelle Celmer<br /><br />She didn't have enough money.<br /><br />Tina DeLuca studied the change in her hand, dread creeping in to seize the empty space in her stomach the measly bowl of soup hadn't filled. It had been the cheapest thing on the menu with any nutritional value. What she hadn't counted on was the sales tax.<br /><br />Not only did she not have money for the check, she wouldn't have enough to use the pay phone on the off chance that she'd found her father. She'd hoped to call first rather than just showing up on his doorstep. Then she could at least determine if he was the correct Martin Lopez before she went barging in on his life.<br /><br />And if he wasn't? If this was another dead end? That feeling of dread swept back in. She was out of money with not a soul on earth to call for help. She had reached the end of the line. She could only hope the city had some sort of shelter she could spend the night in.<br /><br />Or a jail, which is exactly where she would wind up if she couldn't pay her bill, or somehow con her way out of paying it. But the only thing she hated more than being homeless and penniless was lying.<br /><br />\\"Wherever God closes a door he opens a window,\\" her mother had written in her journal. Which had Tina wondering if the restroom had a window she could slip through.<br /><br />No. She'd come this far without lying or cheating anyone. She would just have to be honest and hope the kind-faced woman took pity on her.<br /><br />\\"You sure I can't get you anything else, hon?\\" The kindly old waitress she suspected was the \\"Mae\\" of Mae's Diner hovered by her table and Tina's heart began to pound. Her hands shook so badly some of the change she'd been holding dropped and scattered across the table.<br /><br />Mae's face went from mildly confused to downright concerned. \\"Are you okay?\\"<br /><br />Tina felt like the world's biggest phony. How could she look this thoughtful woman in the eye and tell her that not only was she not going to get a tip for her exemplary service, she was going to be shortchanged on the check.<br /><br />Tina had to come clean.<br /><br />Her nearly empty stomach pitched and rolled, and she felt light-headed. Just do it.<br /><br />\\"I don't have enough,\\" she said, but it came out so softly and her voice was quivering so badly that Mae didn't understand her.<br /><br />\\"What was that, hon? You don't what?\\"<br /><br />\\"Have enough money,\\" she said more loudly, and the two women seated in the next booth turned to look at her with unmasked distaste. Tina's face burned with shame. Could this be any more humiliating? \\"I thought I would have enough,\\" she explained. \\"But I forgot the sales tax. I'm twenty cents short.\\"<br /><br />Mae lifted one penciled-in brow. \\"Twenty cents, huh?\\"<br /><br />Tina felt tears welling in her eyes and fought to hold them in. This wasn't the time to throw herself a pity party. She didn't want Mae to think she was some kind of con artist. \\"I'll do dishes,\\" she said. \\"Or I can cook. I'm a great cook.\\"<br /><br />Mae frowned. \\"You're not from around here, are you?\\"<br /><br />Tina shook her head.<br /><br />\\"Come with me.\\" Mae stepped aside so Tina could get out of her seat. Then she added, \\"To my office.\\"<br /><br />This is it, Tina thought, her heart sinking so low she could feel the persistent throb of her pulse all the way down to her toes. Mae was going to call the police. Oh well, a jail cell was better than sleeping on the street. And if Ray reported what had happened last week, there was no doubt she would be arrested - for assault.<br /><br />Tina stood on wobbly legs and grabbed her backpack from the bench seat. Holding her head high despite the look of pure disdain from the women in the next booth, she followed Mae to the front of the restaurant. She tried to see herself through their eyes. Her clothes were rumpled and dirty from several days without seeing the inside of a washing machine. She probably looked like one of the homeless people she'd seen sleeping at the bus station. She was homeless.<br /><br />Mae led her through the busy kitchen, and Tina's stomach rumbled from all of the magnificent smells lingering there. It had been days since she'd had a real meal. To stretch her limited funds she'd existed on a meager diet, one that consisted primarily of soup and crackers.<br /><br />Mae led her into a tiny office near the back and gestured to one of the metal chairs opposite a small cluttered desk. \\"What's your name, hon?\\"<br /><br />\\"Tina,\\" she said, lowering herself into the chair closest to her and resting her bag against her legs. \\"Tina DeLuca.\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, Tina DeLuca, you wait here.\\" Mae left, closing the door behind her and Tina steeled herself for what was to come. She looked up at several decades' worth of Chamber of Commerce awards and a poster boasting Mae's pastries to be the best in Michigan. Dozens of framed photos of what must have been Mae's children and grandchildren lined the wall. Everyone looked so happy.<br /><br />A big, happy family. Tina was a stranger to the concept. After she'd lost her mother, it had been only her, Aunt Louise and cousin Ray.<br /><br />Some day I'll have a real family, she thought. She would find the right man, settle down and have lots of babies. If she was patient, it would happen.<br /><br />After she got out of prison.<br /><br />She leaned her head back against the wall and closed her eyes. Lord, she was exhausted. She hadn't slept more than a few hours a night since she'd left Philadelphia. She wondered if the beds in jail were more comfortable than a bus seat.<br /><br />The door opened and a ripple of fear turned her limbs to jelly. She waited for the inevitable. For Mae to tell her the police were on the way.<br /><br />Instead the woman set a plate down on the desk in front of Tina. A plate piled high with French fries and an enormous cheeseburger. Next to it she set a large glass of soda.<br /><br />Mouth gaping, all Tina could do was stare. Why was Mae bringing her more food when she couldn't even pay for her soup?<br /><br />Mae circled the desk and took a seat, sliding the top drawer open. She rifled through it for a moment, then looked up at Tina, her brow raised. \\"Are you just going to stare at it?\\"<br /><br />\\"But...\\"<br /><br />\\"You're hungry, aren't you?\\"<br /><br />Mae wasn't calling the police. She was going to help her. Tina's fear melted away and tears welled in her eyes. She hadn't known such kindness existed anymore.<br /><br />\\"Is there someone I can call for you, hon?\\"<br /><br />Tina shook her head. \\"There's no one.\\"<br /><br />\\"I didn't think so. Go ahead and eat it while it's hot.\\" She returned her attention to the open drawer. \\"Now, I know that card is in here somewhere.\\"<br /> <br />Tina shook her head. <br /> <br />\\"Come with me.\\" Mae stepped aside so Tina could get out of her seat. Then she added, \\"To my office.\\" <br /> <br />This is it, Tina thought, her heart sinking so low she could feel the persistent throb of her pulse all the way down to her toes. Mae was going to call the police. Oh well, a jail cell was better than sleeping on the street. And if Ray reported what had happened last week, there was no doubt she would be arrested - for assault. <br /> <br />Tina stood on wobbly legs and grabbed her backpack from the bench seat. Holding her head high despite the look of pure disdain from the women in the next booth, she followed Mae to the front of the restaurant. She tried to see herself through their eyes. Her clothes were rumpled and dirty from several days without seeing the inside of a washing machine. She probably looked like one of the homeless people she'd seen sleeping at the bus station. She was homeless.  <br /> <br />Mae led her through the busy kitchen, and Tina's stomach rumbled from all of the magnificent smells lingering there. It had been days since she'd had a real meal. To stretch her limited funds she'd existed on a meager diet, one that consisted primarily of soup and crackers. <br /> <br />Mae led her into a tiny office near the back and gestured to one of the metal chairs opposite a small cluttered desk. \\"What's your name, hon?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Tina,\\" she said, lowering herself into the chair closest to her and resting her bag against her legs. \\"Tina DeLuca.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Well, Tina DeLuca, you wait here.\\" Mae left, closing the door behind her and Tina steeled herself for what was to come. She looked up at several decades' worth of Chamber of Commerce awards and a poster boasting Mae's pastries to be the best in Michigan. Dozens of framed photos of what must have been Mae's children and grandchildren lined the wall. Everyone looked so happy. <br /> <br />A big, happy family. Tina was a stranger to the concept. After she'd lost her mother, it had been only her, Aunt Louise and cousin Ray. <br /> <br />Some day I'll have a real family, she thought. She would find the right man, settle down and have lots of babies. If she was patient, it would happen. <br /> <br />After she got out of prison. <br /> <br />She leaned her head back against the wall and closed her eyes. Lord, she was exhausted. She hadn't slept more than a few hours a night since she'd left Philadelphia. She wondered if the beds in jail were more comfortable than a bus seat. <br /> <br />The door opened and a ripple of fear turned her limbs to jelly. She waited for the inevitable. For Mae to tell her the police were on the way. <br /> <br />Instead the woman set a plate down on the desk in front of Tina. A plate piled high with French fries and an enormous cheeseburger. Next to it she set a large glass of soda. <br /> <br />Mouth gaping, all Tina could do was stare. Why was Mae bringing her more food when she couldn't even pay for her soup? <br /> <br />Mae circled the desk and took a seat, sliding the top drawer open. She rifled through it for a moment, then looked up at Tina, her brow raised. \\"Are you just going to stare at it?\\" <br /> <br />\\"But...\\" <br /> <br />\\"You're hungry, aren't you?\\" <br /> <br />Mae wasn't calling the police. She was going to help her. Tina's fear melted away and tears welled in her eyes. She hadn't known such kindness existed anymore. <br /> <br />\\"Is there someone I can call for you, hon?\\" <br /> <br />Tina shook her head. \\"There's no one.\\" <br /> <br />\\"I didn't think so. Go ahead and eat it while it's hot.\\" She returned her attention to the open drawer. \\"Now, I know that card is in here somewhere.\\" <br />	2005-06-28

Find a new look<br /><br />2. Find a new apartment<br /><br />3. Find a new man<br /><br />Lauren Hewett had done the near impossible. In one remarkable weekend, she had transformed herself from eternal bridesmaid to foxy female, found a cozy new home and attracted the attention of her longtime crush, Travis Banks. But now that she'd tempted him, what was a good girl like Lauren to do? Could she win over Pinedale's most notorious bachelor with her inner beauty...or would he teach her a thing or two about affairs of the heart?<br /><br />(end book summary).<br /><br />An Excerpt From...<br /><br />Only Skin Deep<br /><br />by Cathleen Galitz<br /><br />Lauren Hewett felt an eerie connection to the imaginary person playing the piano in the corner of the room. Like him, she too was invisible. Actually, the ghost pianist had the advantage over her. He could at least make himself heard, if not seen - something Lauren hadn't been able to manage since shortly after her thirty-fifth birthday. She wasn't sure exactly what caused this phe-nomenon, only that one day she woke up and found herself of an age when no one bothered to ask her opinion on matters of importance anymore, or treat her as anything other than an oddity.<br /><br />As the background music ground to a halt, she gave the antique player piano another crank and reached inside herself for a smile. Smiling vacuously was, after all, one of a maid of honor's many duties - especially when she was the daughter of the bride. Still, Lauren couldn't help but heave a little sigh of regret when a figure clad in ivory lace made her way up the gleaming spiral staircase in the foyer. The bride was the focal point of a room tastefully bedecked with the very floral combination Lauren always envisioned for her own wedding: pink roses, miniature white carnations and baby's breath.<br /><br />\\"Always the bridesmaid, never the bride,\\" she muttered under her breath.<br /><br />Fighting back a wave of melancholy, Lauren focused her attention on a montage of framed pictures hanging on the wall behind her. In her favorite, a little girl with wide green eyes and dark pigtails sat upon her father's lap, blissfully unaware that he would pass out of this world before his only daughter would receive her high school diploma. The woman standing behind the two of them with a hand lovingly draped on her husband's shoulder was a younger version of the smiling bride who was at the moment addressing her guests from halfway up the stairs.<br /><br />Lauren touched a finger to her own lips before plac-ing it to her father's as if to prevent him from saying anything to ruin the moment.<br /><br />\\"Don't worry, Daddy. You'd like him. He makes Mom happy.\\"<br /><br />Across the crowded room, she caught a glimpse of Travis Banks, looking just as bored as she felt. At six-three he stood a good head taller than anyone else in the room. In a tailored black Western suit, he looked even better than she remembered - a feat she hardly thought possible. Lauren was surprised to see him in attendance. It was widely believed that the county's most eligible bachelor avoided all weddings for fear of contracting a highly contagious disease that he was fond of comparing to the plague: nuptialitis.<br /><br />\\"Hurry up, everybody,\\" a voice called out. \\"Barbara's about to toss the bouquet.\\"<br /><br />Younger, prettier and far more visible bachelorettes pressed to the front of the crowd for a chance to catch the flowers that by tradition signaled the end of their single status. Too old and jaded for such nonsense, Lauren faded even more deliberately into the wallpaper and continued to covertly study the man she'd had a crush on since high school. She had been a lowly freshman when, as the senior quarterback for the Wranglers, Travis carried her heart - along with every other girl's in good old Pinedale High over the goal line.<br /><br />Notthat he'd been able to see her back then either....<br /><br />Lauren decided that time had only improved Travis's boyish good looks. There was no sign of gray in his sandy blond hair, and the weight he'd put on looked to be mostly muscle. Although Lauren had little interest in catching a bouquet, she secretly fantasized about catching him. Unfortunately, she doubted she'd be lucky enough to claim a single dance with him all evening.<br /><br />Certainly not when I look like a cupcake whose frosting runneth over in this hideous pastel gown, she thought to herself. How can it be possible that my own mother can be married twice when I've yet to so much as be engaged? And all these years I thought I was the one doing Mom a favor by being there for her. Turns out that I'm the one who's been holding her back....<br /><br />Determinedly Lauren steered her thoughts away from self-pity to more practical matters. Like where she was going to live now that Cupid's heat-seeking missile had found the target painted on the roof of her house. Not that her mother was kicking her out or anything so melodramatic. It went without saying that she was always welcome here. But while it was one thing to rationalize living at home when she had the excuse of taking care of an aging mother, it was quite another sharing a home with a pair of honeymooners. That they were in their sixties was inconsequential to the fact that Lauren's mother was getting more action than she was...<br /><br />\\"Catch, honey!\\"<br /><br />Lauren spun around at the sound of her mother's voice. She barely had time to shield her face from a projectile hurtling across the room at her. Barbara Aberdeen should have played high school football herself for all the precision and accuracy of her throw. The crowd cheered - and laughed - as a red-faced Lauren displayed her ill-gotten prize: one bridal bouquet compliments of a well-meaning, if not openly desperate, mother.<br /><br />Later at the punch bowl, Lauren overheard a disappointed and tipsy Sylvia Porter describe the event as \\"A pity pass if I ever saw one.\\"<br /><br />Lauren wouldn't have thought such a petty remark would have the power to sting at her age. But it did.<br /><br />Maybe even more today than years ago when she and her girlfriends had labored under the misconception that popularity really mattered and dating the right guy was a one-way ticket to happily ever after. The raw wistfulness in Sylvia's voice kept Lauren from confronting the nasty little witch who was so obviously distraught at the thought of ending up as ancient and alone as the day's maid of honor.<br /> <br />Not that he'd been able to see her back then either.... <br /> <br />Lauren decided that time had only improved Travis's boyish good looks.

Book Summary from eHarlequin.com:<br /><br />\\"Love 'em and leave 'em\\" was his specialty...and that made Jude Crenshaw the perfect man for this assignment. His blond, craggy good looks would make it easy for him to woo innocent, sweet Carina Patterson. The skilled secret agent knew he could secure the information he needed before anyone got hurt.<br /><br />Somehow lovely Carina had shaken him right down to his boots. Now, doing his job meant betraying her trust, risking her heart, maybe destroying her family. But the one thing he couldn't do was walk away....<br /><br />An Excerpt From...<br /><br />Double Identity<br /><br />by Annette Broadrick<br /><br />Jude Crenshaw's phone rang at seven o'clock, waking him from a deep, exhausted sleep at his condo in Fort Meade, Maryland. He fumbled for the phone without opening his eyes.<br /><br />\\"Crenshaw,\\" he mumbled.<br /><br />\\"This is Ms. Kincaid's office calling. One moment, please.\\" He was put on hold. Kincaid was his supervisor at the National Security Agency.<br /><br />Jude had worked for the agency for the past four years. He'd been hired as a civilian after leaving the army, where he'd been in Special Ops. He had been in the field until six months ago when he'd been promoted to a supervisory position.<br /><br />He couldn't imagine why Jackie Kincaid would be calling him at home at this time of morning. He sat up, rubbed his hand over his face and swung his legs to the floor.<br /><br />\\"Jude? Jackie. Sorry to bother you so early. I tried to reach you yesterday, but you must have been incommunicado. I couldn't get my calls to go through on your cell phone so I could leave a message.\\"<br /><br />\\"I've been on the west coast for the past two weeks. Got home in the wee hours this morning.\\"<br /><br />\\"I know you're on vacation this week but something's come up here that needs your presence.\\"<br /><br />\\"Staff problems?\\"<br /><br />\\"Nothing like that. We need you at an interdepartmental meeting at nine.\\"<br /><br />He frowned. \\"What department?\\"<br /><br />\\"DEA.\\"<br /><br />\\"You're kidding me.\\"<br /><br />\\"Nope. Do you think you can get here by that time?\\"<br /><br />Jude yawned and said, \\"Sure. No problem.\\"<br /><br />\\"Great. See you then.\\"<br /><br />Jude stood and stretched. His body was still on Pacific Standard Time, which meant he was having to function at four in the morning.<br /><br />He went into his kitchen and made a pot of coffee that would be ready by the time he finished his shower. In the bathroom, his bleary-eyed gaze looked back at him from the mirror.<br /><br />He needed a haircut.<br /><br />He'd been out in the sun quite a bit while in southern California, so that his skin was deeply tanned and his blond hair lighter than usual.<br /><br />Jude showered and shaved, dressed and returned to the kitchen for his caffeine fix. After his first cup, he filled a thermos cup with the rest of the coffee to drink on the way to work and went into the garage where he kept his baby.<br /><br />His two-seater late-model Porsche spent more time in the garage than out on the road. He'd been looking forward to a few days off so he could take her out, wind her up and put her through her paces. The car was the love of his life, and why not? She was always waiting at home when he got there, never complained about the hours he kept, didn't demand attention and didn't eat him out of house and home while he was away.<br /><br />He hit the garage-door button as he stepped through the door and slid behind the wheel. When he turned on the engine, he smiled at the whisper of sound. She was purring for him.<br /><br />Jude drove to the NSA office complex sipping on his coffee, determined not to let the rush-hour traffic disturb him. Once there, he went to his office, checked his mail and headed down the hall to Kincaid's office.<br /><br />He stopped at the desk of Kincaid's assistant, who looked up from opening the morning mail and saw him.<br /><br />\\"Welcome back, Blue Eyes,\\" Justine said, her expression mischievous. \\"I like the tan. Wish I had nothing better to do than lie around on a beach all day soaking up some rays.\\"<br /><br />He lifted one eyebrow and said, \\"Yeah, me, too. I have an appointment with Jackie.\\"<br /><br />\\"Go right in. Mm-mm. I swear, that tan shows you off quite nicely. You probably have to fight off all the women you meet.\\"<br /><br />He shook his head and grinned. \\"Not so's you'd notice.\\"<br /><br />Justine was in her midthirties, happily married with three young daughters. She'd teased him ever since she'd met him that he'd be her pick for a son-in-law if he'd only wait to find a bride until her daughters were grown.<br /><br />He tapped on Jackie's door and walked inside.<br /><br />Three men and a woman sat in front of Jackie's desk. They turned to look at him, their faces grim.<br /><br />One of the men stood and turned to face Jude.<br /><br />He looked to be in his late forties, possibly early fifties, with thick dark hair liberally sprinkled with gray. The man looked trim, probably worked out several times each week. His eyes missed nothing about Jude and Jude caught himself before he polished his shoe on the back of his pants leg.<br /><br />\\"Jude, this is Sam Watson from the Drug Enforcement Agency. With him are three of his agents: John Greene, Hal Pennington and Ruth Littlefield.\\" The agents stood and Jude shook hands with each of them.<br /><br />\\"Now that we're all here, let's go into the conference room where we'll have a little more room,\\" Jackie said, and led the way out of her office.<br /><br />Once they were seated around the conference table, Jackie said, \\"Sam, I'll let you explain to Jude why you wanted to see him.\\"<br /><br />Watson smiled, transforming his craggy face, and Jude decided that the man was younger than he appeared at first glance.<br /><br />\\"Thanks, Jackie,\\" Watson replied. He turned to Jude. \\"I have a major problem with my San Antonio office at the moment. One of my men was killed last week and we have reason to believe that another agent was responsible.\\"<br /><br />Jude straightened. \\"Damn. That's really tough.\\" He glanced at the other agents. \\"You've got to trust the man who's got your back.\\"<br /><br />If possible, they looked even grimmer as each one nodded.<br /><br />\\"I need to get someone down there who I can trust and who can go undercover for us. In my search, I came across your file. You've worked covert operations for several years.\\"<br /><br />\\"That's true.\\"<br /><br />\\"And you're from Texas.\\"<br /><br />Jude grinned. \\"Can't deny that, either.\\"<br /><br />\\"I also found out that your family is well-known in Texas.\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, there's a lot of us there, I'll admit.\\"<br /><br />\\"You would be ideal for what I want to do.\\"<br /><br />Jude nodded and waited.and saw him. <br /> <br />\\"Welcome back, Blue Eyes,\\" Justine said, her expression mischievous. \\"I like the tan.

Book Summary from eHarlequin - Connor Reilly had laughed at his brother for being the first triplet to lose the \\"no sex for ninety days\\" bet. Though there were two long, tempting months ahead for him, Connor was determined to go the distance. Because not only was he a marine; he was a Reilly....<br /><br />For two years, Connor had been coming to Emma Jacobsen's shop, and she'd listened to him talk about this woman and that one. She'd thought their friendship was special. Until he admitted how \\"safe\\" and \\"comfortable\\" he felt around her. Well, war declared! She was going to show her \\"pal\\" just how much of a threat she could be to his winning the bet!<br /><br />The Reilly triplets bet they could go ninety days without sex. Hmmm...  [...]<br />This book is great - I loved the whole story - Emma is a tomboy who owns an auto mechanic shop and Conner is one of her closest friends - he hangs out with her to talk cars, etc.  He makes the mistake of telling Emma he feels safe hanging out with her during the \\"no sex\\" bet with his brothers because he doesn't see her as a woman.  Needless to say, this does not make her very happy, so she sets out to show him just how much of a woman she is by dressing up and showing him her sexier side & driving him crazy with lust - her punishment for him overlooking her sexuality will be him losing his precious bet to her - the one woman he considered himself immune to's charms.  This is a great read - lots of steamy scenes.	2005-06-28

But Abigail was not high maintenance, not self-involved. What she was was hot. And she made him hotter just thinking about her. But he had to ask himself a question: What could he possibly offer an Ashton virgin?<br /><br />Dynasties: The Ashtons - A family built on lies...brought together by dark, passionate secrets.	2005-06-28

But when Mike Evans, the dashing new police chief, asked her to help him solve a special case, it wasn't quite so easy to read his intentions.  All she knew was that her heart, which had been sitting on a dusty shelf, suddenly tumbled off.  Before long, Mike has her convinced that they made a dynamite team at work - and at play.  But could she bear to have her safe, well-organized world so irresistibly invaded by a man who lived on a first-name basis with danger?  Especially when she discovered that when it came to love, Mike Evans was more than a little gun-shy?	2005-06-28

This is a really great romance - Jane Porter does a great job again. It is great to see how the hot sheikh convinces her that he wants her for who she is - wild past and all.  She is dumbfounded when she realizes that it was her he wanted all along - not her sister as she had been led to believe (and who she was impersonating!) - it was all a scheme cooked up because he knew it was the only way to get her there.  There are some really cute scenes where he baits her by pretending to critisize her \\"sister\\" (really her) by talking about rumors and other personality traits and claiming to find them offensive and unacceptable.  Very hot and very romantic - makes you want to be swept off to the desert by a handsome sheikh!	2005-06-28

This is a great romance - the heroine comes back to a town where she is hated and judged because of the character of her late mother - it is heart wrenching to read about how cruelly she is treated based on people's mistaken impressions of her.  She's home to find out who her father is, but while she's there, she falls in love with the last person she should - the grandson of one of her mother's former husbands.
