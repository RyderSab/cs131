He loves it and asks to read it about four times a day. The text is easy to understand. It explains some of babies' limitations (\\"Too little to walk. Too little to talk.\\") and also talks about why babies cry, etc. The illustrations are really sweet and everyone is smiling, even the kitty cat.<br />The one thing I don't like about this book is that it assumes the mom will be bottlefeeding. There are bottles in several pictures (one shows the brother giving a bottle). Since we breastfeed, I would have preferred a book where the mother nurses the baby. However, this hurdle was easily overcome by some quick mommy text improvisation. (\\"Babies like to nurse,\\" instead of \\"Babies like to drink milk\\"). All in all, it's a great sibling book and one I don't hesitate to recommend.	2002-04-25

However, it is a very sweet book. The plot has been summarized already so I won't get into that. One thing I enjoyed about this book is that the children act like real children, that is, they interfere at the most inopportune moments with their mother's love life! And Leander...who *wouldn't* marry him? He is suave, capable, and also a younger man, a definite plus. Judith, on the other hand... Well, she's just kind of *there*. I wasn't impressed with her, but I didn't dislike her either. She just seemed colorless.<br />I also agree with the other reviewer's statement that there is little sexual tension or sex in the book. Obviously no one reads these books for sex but it seemed odd to me that the encounters between two newlyweds, even if they were a marriage of convenience, were so far-spaced.<br />All in all, however, it is a very well-written and sweet book, and I enjoyed reading it. My favorite Beverley is still Forbidden, however, and I can't wait until it is reissued.	2001-11-14

Beth unwittingly makes matters worse when, not realizing that her fiance is as trapped as she is, she brags about having had numerous (fictional) affairs to try to get him to break their engagement. Lucien, very much a man of his time, spends much of the book trying to figure out how to keep his improperly raised wife &quot;in line,&quot; and even after discovering the truth about Beth's virginity still has lingering doubts about her virtue. <br />Three cheers to Beverley for taking such a somber-sounding plot and turning it into a wonderful exploration of character and gender issues, while never losing the main focus of the story: the romance. These two characters are more than a match for each other, and I love that they didn't just get married and have all their problems disappear after great sex. In fact, there isn't much sex in this book at all, but there is plenty of tension, sexual and otherwise. <br />And yes, there is an incident of domestic violence that occurs after our complex hero has just bared his soul. I personally think that he should have grovelled a deal more, despite Beth's insistence that he not do so, which is why this book gets 4 rather than 5 stars.	2001-02-12

Her research is, as always, impeccable. (Contrary to what a previous reviewer has said, her hero's name should not be Lord Nicholas. Daughters of an earl are &quot;Lady Firstname,&quot; and sons of an earl are &quot;The Honourable Firstname Lastname.&quot;) The historical detail, however, only serves as a delicious garnish for an impeccably drawn, complicated romantic entanglement between an unwilling bride trapped by circumstances not of her own creation, and a brave gentleman willing to (temporarily) sacrifice his own happiness for the sake of his country.<br />This is a grown-up tale of two people who, thrown together in the most uncomfortable of circumstances, learn first to live with each other, then to love each other. Jo Beverley more than earns her reputation as the thinking person's romance author in this touching novel.	2001-01-27

Rosamund Albritton, a lovely British lady, was normally the most gentle of persons. But after her fiance died in the English Civil War fighting the Jacobites, she found herself hating the rebels with an intensity foreign to her nature.<br />When she met Dr. Robert Victor at a party, she was offended by his angry glances and coarse manners. Her distrust and disdain were fueled by his haughty, unsympathetic demeanor when he was forced to tend her injury during a stormy Channel crossing. And while he claims to be her brother's friend, why did he mistake her next door neighbor for her relative?<br />Patricia Veryan has created captivatingly realistic characters, a world of intrigue and danger, and expertly mixed them to produce an adventure that will have the reader staying up until the wee hours of the morning, breathlessly following Rosamund's escapades. The romance between Rosa and Dr. Victor is wonderfully developed. Veryan's characterization is so perfect that one truly feels that they are real people. I couldn't recommend this book highly enough for those in search of truly great writing that transcends genre.	2000-11-06

I enjoy those authors too, but Elizabeth Mansfield is a pleasant change from the norm. She uses as her model Jane Austen's character-driven stories. This is one case where that model works extremely well. I won't bother to summarize the plot, as that's been done. Pippa is an endearing heroine, if a bit too willing to sacrifice herself for others' well-being. Her confusion about where her heart truly lies is well-written, and the conclusion of the book is extremely satisfying and heartwarming. If you are looking for a good story with realistic characters and a gentle mood, this is the place to go.	2000-11-06

This is the first book by Ms. Metzger that I have read, but it certainly won't be the last! I won't summarize the plot, as others have already done so. However, I will say that a story that could have been rather sordid becomes a fun-filled romp under Metzger's expert direction. Her witty narration is absolutely fabulous without being &quot;cute,&quot; and her characters are endearingly flawed but noble. The marriage of convenience that becomes a love match is a favorite theme of mine, and it was presented at its very best in this novel.	2000-11-06

Mary Balogh. My high expectations were by no means disappointed. This is the story of shy Margaret Wells, an unwed 25-year-old lady who has for six long years nursed a secret passion for the Earl of Brampton. During her year as a debutante, the two met at a masquerade and fell hard for each other. She knew his identity, but her own remained hidden from the earl. When the time for unmasking arrived, Margaret had already been jerked away from the ball by her parents and never found the courage to reveal who she was to the earl. Now, he is looking for a marriage of convenience, and Margaret, thinking this is her one chance at happiness, agrees to serve as his boring, proper bride.<br />Alas for her expectations--the earl is still in love with his &quot;angel,&quot; the masked girl from six years ago, and has no intentions of pursuing deeper feelings with his convenient wife. When Margaret realizes this, she decides on one last, desperate ploy...she will once again disguise herself and try to win his heart.<br />This novel is wonderfully written. It holds the necessary descriptions of Regency mores, dresses, carriages, etc., but it also sweeps the reader away into a tangled web of complicated feelings and relationships that transcend the time period. One caveat to the reader new to Balogh--unlike most traditional Regencies, this book does have sex in it. But Balogh always uses it as a means to further reveal her characters' growth, never as a flimsy substitute for plot.	2000-11-04

I couldn't applaud her choice more! Mr. Brundy, despite his lower-class origins and dreadful clothing, is a real charmer who remains true to himself while gently wooing his lady. Lady Helen's metamorphosis from Ice Princess to loving wife is believable and also allows the reader to come to like her just as much as her husband.

Sera, the heroine, is a  lovely, impoverished girl who must seek a position to provide for herself  and her very young sister, Delight. Her father, a viscount, died and could  make no provision for them because the entail hands everything over to his  heir, a regular scoundrel. A friend from school, Eugenia, discovers Sera's  plight and invites her to teach her cousin Nicholas' parrot to sing.  Nicholas' Aunt Winifred bequeathed the parrot and almost three hundred  thousand pounds to Nicholas. The catch? The parrot must learn to sing--a  real song!--by a certain date or else all the money goes to another cousin  of Nicholas'.<br />Nicholas is *not* an amazingly handsome, dashingly sure of  himself hero. Instead, he is a truly gentle man, chivalrous to the core,  fond of small animals and children and tenderly protective of those in his  charge. Due to paternal neglect, he has no idea of his own worth and so  must overcome the obstacle of low self-esteem before he can claim his dear  lady--as well as many other obstacles. Sera is sweet, a little too fond of  gothic romance, and quite devoted to her family and friends. I thought this  book was absolutely great entertainment and I can't wait to read the next  three books in the series.	2000-08-30

Set in the Regency era, the premise involves two  spinster ladies, twins, who are in their fifties. Miss Amy and Miss Effy  Tribble are desperately poor, but have in their favor their excellent  address (on Holles Street) and good family name. Unable to make ends meet,  they despair of ever being warm again. Their salvation arrives in the form  of Mr. Haddon, a friend from long ago who returns from India a very wealthy  man. Shrewd Mr. Haddon, knowing the sisters will never accept the financial  help he is longing to give, suggests the girls go into genteel business for  themselves, presenting difficult young misses into society, ensuring good  marriages. _Perfecting Fiona_ is about Fiona, a girl from a strict Scottish  family who is an heiress. She has almost received numerous proposals, but  each time the prospective bridegroom goes into the drawing room to ask her  to marry him, he exits as if shot from a cannon, babbling to her chaperones  that he only meant to get a recipe for mincemeat pie, or something equally  silly. Her aunt and uncle, in despair of ever getting their niece off their  hands, turn her over to the Tribble sisters, and that's when the real fun  begins. Can Effy and Amy discover the truth behind Fiona's determination  not to marry? Will Fiona ever find true love? What about the rakish Lord  Peter Havard, who seems too interested in a girl from the gentry to suit  his haughty duke and duchess parents? And will Mr. Haddon *ever* realize  Amy's affection for him is more than platonic? This is a rollicking good  time from one of the masters of the Regency genre.	2000-08-23

As an avid Clancy fan since _The Hunt for Red October_, I was almost  hesitant about reading this book because I was afraid my expectations were  too high after _Rainbow Six_. Fortunately, my fears were completely  unjustified! Clancy just keeps getting better and better. I read all 1000+  pages in one day (and night). The entire book was so incredibly suspenseful  that I just couldn't put it down. The technology featured in the story is  absolutely fascinating. All of my favorite characters from previous books  were included, and the newer characters were very well drawn, especially  Lian Ming and Nomuri, the CIA spy who seduces Lian Ming into surrendering  the contents of her computer...and other things, of course. The inside look  at the functioning of the White House is like the TV show &quot;The West  Wing&quot; would be if the President were a conservative independent, which  is to say it's very entertaining but without the liberal bent. This is an  absolute must-read for Clancy fans and a great first-time choice for those  few who still don't see what all the fuss is about.	2000-08-23

Where is the talented and entrancing author of _The Mandarin of Mayfair_ and _Love Alters Not_? Well, wherever  she may be, her talents are certainly not shown to advantage in this  adventure tale set in the Regency. Perhaps if I had not expected another of  the touching and authentic romances Ms. Veryan writes so well, I wouldn't  have been so greatly disappointed with Alabaster Royal. The mystery itself  is very well-written, and despite the clues I didn't guess the identity of  the villain until the very end. Unfortunately, the hero is a pale shadow of  the strong, honorable man I've come to expect from this author, and the  heroine is so completely stupid and headstrong that she makes the reader  absolutely *long* for her to get a good swift slap. She's a throwback to  Deidre from _The Lord and the Gypsy_, only five times worse.<br />If you are  trying Patricia Veryan for the first time, I would greatly recommend you  read her &quot;Jewelled Men&quot; or &quot;Golden Chronicles&quot; series.  This book will give you absolutely no idea of her true worth as an author.	2000-08-16

I think the reason I like it above  the others is because Rachel, unlike her sisters, is not really obsessed  with getting Mannerling back. She is quiet, loving, and not overly  ambitious. Ms. Chesney develops the romance nicely, with the standard  obstacles to true love thrown in (scheming romantic rival, interfering  relatives). However, those standards are a great deal more fun in a Chesney  book than in anyone else's. The hero's children are believably written and  actually add to the story rather than distracting from it. I recommend this  novel to any Regency reader who wants an undemandingly fun read.	2000-08-15

Perhaps the reason some of the previous reviewers didn't like this novel  is because some of the subject matter is very dark and disturbing. However,  I found that the subplot involving the duke's parents' history added  unexpected depth and intrigue to what otherwise would have been a standard  Regency storyline (unpopular girl gets help from popular lord who ends up  falling for now-popular girl). That being said, even if just the standard  storyline had been followed this would have still been a fantastic read.  Ms. Lansdowne's hero is intriguing and very likeable, and her heroine is  spunky, adorable, and very appealing. The secondary characters are also  skillfully depicted. I highly recommend this novel to those Regency readers  who want an experience above and beyond the usual.	2000-08-15

It combines a great deal of suspense with several  romances, the main one being between the Earl of Wright  (&quot;Legion&quot;) and Eleanor, the vicar's sister (not daughter, as the  back cover erroneously states). As with several Lansdowne heroes, the earl  has issues from his past to overcome before he can truly settle down and be  happy with his lady. However, he is without a doubt loveable and tender and  his habit of taking care of ladies in distress is quite endearing. The  female leads are strong, courageous, and yet not at all anachronistic,  which I found a refreshing change from the normal spunky heroine. The story  is smoothly developed, the conclusion is very satisfying, and the romances  are all extremely convincing in their development as well. I couldn't  recommend this book more to any fan of great writing, let alone Regency  romance.	2000-08-14

Lesson Number One of buying a Regency: If there are more than two copies on  the shelf, chances are it is an inferior romance. I ignored this  hard-earned lesson and bought it anyway, trusting in the positive reviews.  I shouldn't have. The character's motivations are absolutely inexplicable.  Why does this hero, in complete violation of every moral of the day,  persist in kissing a woman to whom he is not engaged? Why does she continue  to allow him to treat her in such a fashion when she's not sure of her  future with him? This could have been explained in the story's narrative,  but wasn't. And I couldn't agree more with the reader from Boston's  quibbles with word misusage. Whatever happened to copyeditors!  (By the  way, she uses &quot;diffidence&quot; when she means  &quot;indifference.&quot; Just in case it drove you crazy too.) The  conversation is stilted; the mystery is boring, and since any tension in  the romance was completely gone by page 185, I found it difficult to  motivate myself to read the remaining 33 pages. If you are looking for a  good Regency romance, I recommend Emma Lange, Judith A. Lansdowne, or the  fantastic Patricia Veryan, but I don't recommend Ms. Hendrickson's attempt  at fiction.	2000-08-14

This book's hero is quite different from the bored, sophisticated older  man that Heyer usually casts in that role. Instead, &quot;Sherry&quot; is a  gentleman in his early twenties who must marry to take control of his  fortune from his unscrupulous uncle. When his current infatuation rejects  his proposal, Sherry, miffed, finds a childhood friend in the village (Hero  Wantage, &quot;not quite seventeen&quot;) and marries her instead. Sherry's  close friends all play a major role in the story and are admirably drawn,  as are the hero and heroine. There are plenty of comic moments, the romance  is quite believably developed, and I found myself laughing aloud more than  once at the scrapes Hero keeps getting herself into. This is Ms. Heyer at  her very best, and an excellent first-time pick for those Regency readers  who wonder what all the fuss is about this grande dame of period romance.	2000-08-09

The character development reaches its pinnacle, the loose ends  and seeming inconsistencies from previous novels in the series are tied up  and explained, and the mystery itself (which many people found secondary to  the romance angle) I found extremely intriguing.

If it were anyone other than the  fantastic Patricia Veryan the rating would probably be five stars.  Unfortunately, she has in the past shown her readers that she is capable of  attaining far greater heights than this book. However, the story of Val and  Susan is quite entertaining. The subplots are more engrossing than the  actual romance. Valentine is a suitable hero but Susan is the screechy,  quick-to-jump-to-the-worst-conclusion-possible type of heroine I deplore.  Having made that clear, let me just say that anything Patricia Veryan  writes is worth looking into, and this book is no exception. Regardless of  your personal feelings towards the main characters, this story is carefully  crafted and comes to a surprising finish. One more bonus, especially for  the Dev-otees in Veryan land: Alain Devinish makes a cameo appearance, as  does the mysterious Diccon.	2000-08-08

Some of her scenes were well-written and the  relationship between the two main characters was thoroughly explored.  However, the conversations were absolutely wooden as written, the  characters behaved in anachronistic fashion, and the title character's name  is *consistently misused* which distracted and frustrated me so much that I  couldn't enjoy what there was of the storyline. Whatever happened to  copyeditors, anyway? Ms. Solomon, I beg of you, do a little fundamental  research! As written, the hero's family name was Sinclair, but his title  was something else entirely. Therefore, the title of this book should be,  &quot;Seducing Lord Something-Else-Entirely.&quot; If you are looking for  good traditional Regency romance, I recommend Emma Lange, Marion Chesney,  or the always stellar Patricia Veryan, but I'd skip this one.	2000-08-06

Her  research is always good (her degree is in European studies) and her  characters never fail to captivate. This book is about Susannah, the  daughtor of a duke, and Connor O'Neill, her grandmother's horse trainer who  happens to be an earl going incognito for reasons of his own that have  nothing to do with Susannah. One of the things I enjoyed the most about  this book (and most of Lange's efforts) is that although there is some  friction between the characters neither the hero or the heroine languish  about saying to themselves &quot;I hate him/her!&quot; when they actually  realize they feel quite the opposite. The tale is very sweet and the  subplot involving Irish rebels is also quite well done. A good choice for  any Regency fan.	2000-08-03

They often  feature witty dialogue and absolutely hilarious secondary characters. This  book features neither of these. Unfortunately, the heroine I found  unsympathetic and the hero was quite dull. The only funny moments came from  the little menagerie the heroine builds for herself, and those were few and  far between. The overall tone of the story was lonely and disaffected. This  isn't the best example of Chesney's work. To see her in much better form I  would recommend any of the books in the School for Manners or Six Sisters  series, which are all far superior to this one.	2000-08-02
US	50960062	R1BLX8C2RHBDOI	0449002101	623382825	The Love Match/Quadrille (Omnibus)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Well, Three Stars for One, Four for the Other	This is actually a reprinting of two Chesney novels. The first, The Love Match, is the final volume of a trilogy. You can enjoy it quite well  without having read the first two books, however. This is a high-quality  story with a great heroine and fabulous secondary characters as well as a  hero who is much more sympathetic than many. Felicity, the heroine, has  been left with a fortune in jewels by her adoptive parent but is determined  not to use them. Instead she decides to make her living as a novelist. Her  attempt turns into a best-selling novel, but her authorship is discovered,  and the gentleman who finds her out pledges to help her discover the secret  of her birth...out of purely platonic friendship, of course. Naturally  things work out just as we hoped in the end but getting there is  three-quarters of the fun. This is the novel I would give four stars  to.<br />The second novel, Quadrille, I would give just three stars, although  it is also an enjoyable read. The story centers around Hugo and Mary. Mary  is a plain girl who was married to Hugo for his title, while she brought  her desperately needed fortune to him. Hugo is an officer in the British  army and brought her along with him to Brussels. The details of the Battle  of Waterloo are for the most part seen through the eyes of those who stay  behind, but it is after the pair return to England that the story really  picks up. Mary falls in love with her gruff, much-older husband, while he  does not care much one way or the other for her. There are some rather  coarse and shocking moments in this book (I believe it is one of Chesney's  earlier efforts) but it is still fun. And when purchasing two books for the  price of one, it is hard to feel a loser.	2000-08-02

It seems to me that in all genres, but especially that  of Regency Romance, it is extremely difficult to predict the quality of  writing and the research behind that writing.<br />This novel was a happy  surprise. It is the first I've read by Emma Lange and it definitely made me  want to buy more. The storyline is intriguing (an earl is forced by honor  to marry a girl of good family when he mistakes her for a willing bedmate  and takes her virginity--she's been drugged by an unscrupulous servant) and  the romance is very well-developed. The secondary characters are, for the  most part, well-fleshed out. I also enjoyed the fact that the main  characters' family played a large part in the storyline and did not fall  into the usual Regency role (established by the great Heyer) of  dysfunctional, irritating hangers-on. And yes, she does get the titles  right! I really recommend this book to those trying Lange for the first  time--it's better than fluff!	2000-08-02

She completely transcends the &quot;Regency Romance&quot; genre and creates a fantastic blend of adventure, action, and romance. Her characters are  memorable and endearing, especially the two who are romantically involved,  Tristram and Rachel. The book opens with a moving depiction of the Battle  of Waterloo. Rachel accompanies her friend, Sister Maria, on a dangerous  quest to find a British man with important information. Along the way,  their lives are endangered by looters and they are rescued by a tall, badly  wounded man who collapses immediately after his gallant deed. Even his  nationality is in doubt, but Rachel will not leave without him. The man  awakens to find he's lost his memory, and that he has fallen in love with  the gentle Rachel, who nursed him back to health. However, he soon finds  that Rachel is engaged to a powerful, wealthy Frenchman named Claude  Sanguinet, and that she cannot in honor or prudence renege on her promise  to wed him.<br />The two's journey to happiness is loaded with twists and  turns. The action scenes are very well written and the conclusion is often  in doubt. An excellent opening to an excellent series!	2000-07-31

Good golly, with the film being as bad as it was, was I insane to even attempt reading this book? Yeah, probably.<br />At least in the book, the characters' motivations are explained in much more detail and are more  understandable. Also, the Eye is twenty years older than Joanna (who's  bisexual in the book and has meaningful relationships with women) and  follows her for about a decade instead of six months. Things that were  difficult to understand in the movie, like why he stops her wedding to the  wine mogul, are fully explained in the book.<br />Unfortunately, being able to  understand the characters doesn't make them any more likeable. It's a  tawdry tale with an excessive amount of gratuitous profanity. And, like the  movie, the ending really STINKS. Not recommended.	2000-07-31

As the oldest of four siblings, I can say quite honestly that now that I am an adult I am good friends with my brothers and sister. Even so, I truly wish that my parents had found this book when I was a kid. So much damage  and hurt feelings could have been prevented! The techniques are presented  in an easy-to-understand fashion and the cartoons illustrate examples that  parents will recognize from real life. The chapter on dealing with your own  wounds from the past was incredible. Perhaps the highest praise I can give  this book is to say that before I read it, I was extremely scared to have a  second child, but now I can approach that eventuality without fear.	2000-07-31

The story  focuses mainly upon the relationship between Josie Storm and her guardian,  Alain Devinish. When last we saw them in &quot;Sanguinet's Crown,&quot;  Josie was a little foundling whose age could have been anywhere between  eight and twelve. This book occurs seven years later. Josie is a young lady  now whose charming personality captivates almost everyone she meets. She  wishes some of that charm would work on her guardian, but unfortunately he  shows no sign of returning her very grown-up kind of love, instead treating  her as a child. Is Dev still pining over his lost love, Yolande, who  married his cousin? Will Josie be able to elude the determined pursuit of  her many beaux? Will the youngest Sanguinet brother, Guy, ever be granted  an entre into Polite Society?<br />This book is, as is the case with all  Veryans, extremely well written with impeccable characterization. The story  is engrossing but does not deal with as heavy subject matter as the  previous books in the series. It's a great read, but I recommend reading  the other books first to get the history behind the relationships;  otherwise you'll be missing out on the full experience!	2000-07-31

I reread it often and it never fails to draw me in, regardless of--or perhaps because of--my familiarity with the characters  and story. The story is not told chronologically, which can at times be a  bit confusing, but in the end the way the events are recounted enhances the  story. The characters are very believable; by the end of the book one feels  that one knows them well and is sorry to have to say goodbye. The author's  style of prose is positively poetic; this is an excellent read-aloud book  as well, after the style of The Chronicles of Narnia. (I know, because I've  done it!)	2000-07-29

However, too often the authors' advice reflects  western parenting prejudice and does not present research representing  opposing viewpoints--although it pretends to do so. For instance, in the  13th month or so, a hypothetical question is, &quot;Why should I wean my  baby if we're both enjoying nursing still?&quot; The reply? &quot;Oh, you  don't have to...it's your choice...but here's all the reasons why you  should.&quot; And then they go on to list twelve benefits of early weaning  and absolutely none of the benefits of nursing a toddler! If the authors  gave even the tiniest disclaimer (&quot;In our opinion...&quot;) I wouldn't  be so hard about this, but they present every answer as gospel truth.<br />In  other words, whether or not you will benefit from this book depends on the  state of your parenting philosophy. I prefer &quot;The Baby Book&quot; for  advice about toddler behavior and needs.	2000-07-26

This book was great at setting to rest some of the myths surrounding this famous couple  and also presented some information I hadn't seen anywhere else about their  private lives in the White House. I discovered many things about Jackie's  life growing up that I did not know previously, and how those events  factored into her decision to marry JFK.<br />Sometimes the author's narrative  style can be jarring (&quot;'And what would be wrong with,' she asked  coyly, 'that?'&quot;) but I do not find the dialogues related to be  unrealistic. It was rather like reading a transcript of an extra-long  episode of A &amp; E's &quot;Biography&quot; television show. The book is  an engaging account of a typical high-society marriage with a tragic  &quot;what might have been in this marriage&quot; twist resulting from Mr.  Kennedy's assasination so soon after the death of their baby brought the  two much closer together.	2000-07-24

Alas for my expectations! Maxim seems to have been having a  difficult time writing this novel. Most jarring of all are the  &quot;jumping tenses,&quot; by which I mean literally within the same  sentence the verbs will change from present to past to future tense. Maybe  this is some literary tool that's supposed to make the tale more  suspenseful; I found it annoying. Also, some of the plot devices has the  hero seemingly unusually thick-headed (I'm thinking, 'for Pete's sake, man,  it's called a contact lense!') just so his heroine can be brilliant and  explain the whole thing to him later.<br />That being said, the relationships  between the characters are extremely convincing and well-developed, the  motivations behind the bad guys' actions are mysterious and revealed  masterfully, and I also especially enjoyed the character of Moon (he should  have his own book!). Maxim's worst is still better than the majority of  books written in his chosen genre.	2000-07-24

I had already read a lot about attachment parenting in Dr. Sears' books so I wasn't sure I would find anything new in here. Boy, was I wrong! This book has so many scientific studies that support a  parenting style that in my heart I already felt was right. The internet  resources are also really extensive and so helpful. The suggested reading  is also varied and informative. I especially appreciated the chapters on  breastfeeding; they are fantastic! The writing style is very readable and  makes it easy to assimilate the information given.

My child seemed to be the only baby in the world who would not fall asleep in the car, hated the baby swing, and did not happily go to anyone but his mother to be held. Reading  this book let me know that there are others out there, and that my child is  not better or worse than other children, just different.<br />The techniques  given to soothe a fussy baby are very helpful. Also, I really benefited  from the chapter on mother burnout. <br />One complaint would be that it  doesn't address the feelings of the father of a high-need baby, or at least  not very much. Also, the special challenges faced by single parents of  high-need babies are not really addressed. All in all, however, it is a  great book and perhaps the best message of all is the assurance that your  child is normal and can grow to be a healthy member of society without  causing parental insanity. Parents who wish they could have found this book  when their child was a baby would probably benefit from reading  &quot;Raising Your Spirited Child.&quot;	2000-05-01

This book is a real lifesaver. Upon purchasing it, I tore through it in one night and then settled down for a more in-depth study. All I can say is, it's really amazing! It helps parents of what are traditionally called  \\"strong-willed\\" children to redefine their children as  \\"spirited.\\"    This is not to say the book advocates letting your  child rule the roost. In fact, careful reading will reveal that the  objective for parents of a spirited kid is to help him learn to cope with  the world he lives in with socially acceptable behavior (obeying house  rules, for example) without having to change the personality he was born  with. It really helps the parent learn about their child's weaknesses and  strengths and gives the parent many techniques that have proven to be  effective.    The author is herself the mother of two, one of whom is  \\"spirited\\" and is now in his twenties. I found her sympathetic  writing style to be extremely readable and the use of a hypothetical class  (based on real-life classes the author has taught for many years) of  parents to make the assimilation of information much easier than it might have been otherwise.    Especially helpful were the sections on sleeping,  coping with difficult school situations, and social strategies. Readers who  might be turned off by \\"Parenting the Fussy Baby and High Need  Child\\" author William Sears' recurrent advocation of Attachment  Parenting will find most principles here have nothing to do with that  parenting style (although the author does say not to be afraid to take the  baby in bed with you if you all sleep better that way). Those who do  Attachment Parent will find nothing here to contradict their childrearing  beliefs. It is a happy medium between \\"Parenting the Fussy Baby and  High Need Child\\" and Dobson's \\"The Strong-Willed Child.\\"    I do feel one caveat should be added--since I originally read the book, my son has been diagnosed with Sensory Integration Dysfunction. Many of the spirited childcharacteristics are shared (in spades) by children with this disorder. Parents should be careful not to allow the information in this book to lull them into a false sense of well-being if their gut (or their pediatrician, or their child's teacher) tells them that something is really wrong.	2000-05-01

The final chapter is a bit convoluted and the reader who devoured  the novel may have to go back and re-read certain portions, but that's  hardly a punishment. This is the best of the series that occurs while  Ramses is still a child.<br />Readers who enjoy this book might also enjoy  Peters' books written under the nom de plume Barbara Michaels.	2000-05-01

I personally recommend the Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby, which is not nearly as doctor-centered. The authors seem to imply that no educated woman would have a home birth, use a midwife, or do a lot of other things that are known as  &quot;alternative&quot; choices. Instead of presenting real facts, they  quickly dismiss these options and definitely try to scare the reader into  feeling an ob/gyn and hospital birth is the only way to go.<br />I did enjoy  the section at the beginning of each chapter that showed what the baby  looked like and listed its development for that month. You can also get a  newsletter detailing these developments from many baby websites, though, so  to me that didn't make it worthwhile to buy the book.<br />I didn't feel  particularly guilty after reading the sections on diet (which, by the way,  are outrageously difficult to follow and seemed designed for women who can  sit at home and make marks on a dietary checklist). However, the part that  scared me was reading the &quot;baby roulette&quot; section. I had a  migraine for three days and didn't take anything for it because I was  afraid it would hurt my baby. Now, looking back, I think the huge amounts  of stress hormones that were released in my bloodstream from the pain were  probably just as bad as a few Excedrin would've been.<br />In short, this  information is available in far more friendly formats in The Unofficial  Guide To Having a Baby and The Pregnancy Book by the Sears. I recommend  them.	2000-04-29

They are almost identical.<br />My biggest concern with the system outlined here is the authors' lack of credentials.  Mr. Ezzo has a masters of arts, it's true, but that is because he has had  life experience credited to him. He has no associate's or bachelor's degree  from any university. His wife, Anne Marie, worked briefly as an RN close to  20 years ago. They have no formal training in child psychology, pediatrics,  lactation...in other words, reading this book is like walking up to a  grandma you see on the street and asking her for her opinion on how you're  raising your child.<br />My other concern is how they seem to set the parent  up for an adversarial relationship with their child. I am all for parents  being the leaders of their families. However, the practices this book  encourages seem unnecessarily inflexible.<br />If you are looking for a  parenting manual that takes a more balanced and medically informed  approach, I recommend The Complete Book of Christian Parenting and  Childcare, by William Sears M.D. and his wife, Martha Sears, R.N., who have  8 kids themselves.	2000-04-29

However, it is very preachy, most of the characters are two dimensional, and I found myself skipping large portions of the text without  feeling I was missing out. (I later went back and re-read it, and  discovered my initial impression was correct.) The hero especially is a  pale shadow of the irascable yet tender man that Michaels usually writes so  well.<br />If you are a Barbara Michaels fan already, you will probably like  this book. I am, and I did. However, if you are trying her for the first  time, I recommend &quot;Shattered Silk&quot; or &quot;The Wizard's  Daughter,&quot; both of which are superior in terms of writing quality and  suspense.

However, it does not judge women who decide to have drugs; it does talk about how to use those drugs appropriately.

Other than that, I found it pretty UNhelpful.<br />I disliked the arbitrary nature  of the authors' advice on crying especially. In the advice for the first  month they (rightly, in my opinion)advise the hypothetical questioner that  it's impossible to spoil a newborn and that she should pick the baby up  when she cries. But all of a sudden, by the third or fourth month, they're  telling you that the baby is &quot;manipulating&quot; you and you'll need  to harden your heart and let her cry it out. They even are subtly insulting  to parents who don't let their children do so, implying that those parents  are wimps.<br />I also didn't like how they invalidated parents' choices that  don't agree with typical Western childrearing practices. They really come  down hard against co-sleeping especially, giving outdated reasons against  it. I think a better approach would have been giving pros and cons, then  giving safety measures to take, and trusting the parent to make his or her  own choice.<br />Also, the advice on breastfeeding is often medically  inaccurate and disagrees with the AAP's recommendations regarding that  practice. A better all-around childcare manual is the Baby Book or, if  you're a Christian, The Complete Book of Christian Childcare, by the  Sears.<br />I appreciated the section on Best Odds recipes only after my son  turned 1, because that was the first time when he could eat any of them!	2000-04-29

It was a fluke that my medical provider had this book in her lending library; I read it and felt my every idea about parenting had been challenged! Before I read this book, I thought people who slept with their  babies and breastfed past one year were weird. Now I see that these are  valid parenting options.<br />Like every book on parenting, it is important to  take the information offered, try what seems right, and keep what works for  you. My husband also found it very challenging and informative, so I don't  agree with the previous review which stated fathers and working moms won't  benefit from this book. For the record, I myself am a mother who holds down  a second job outside the home (I consider parenting my first job). I did  not find the opinions offered on working mothers condemning. Perhaps those  that do are already feeling guilty because of their choice and choose to  blame this book for those feelings. Then again, maybe not. I've noticed  that both mothers employed outside the home and those who only work at home  complain about the lack of support and the condemnation they receive for  their lifestyle choice. My reply to this is, *women* don't receive enough  support, period!<br />In conclusion, if you are ready to read a very  informative volume which also offers a  compassionate alternative to our  cultural norm for parenting, read this book.	1999-10-14
