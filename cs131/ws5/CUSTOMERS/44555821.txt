I particularly enjoy her characterization of Elizabeth I. <br /> <br />  On the other hand however her period detail is simply awful. The Duke of Norfolk's household is Victorian rather than Elizabethan. A nobleman would not have a housekeeper but a Steward for example and the servants would not eat in the kitchen but in hall. The use of first names by all and sundry is irritating, in those days a lady would call even her husband 'Master Stannard', and a man-servant would not be called 'Master Brockley'.  <br /> <br />   Ursula herself is far too Nineties in her sensibility, especially in her attitude towards religion.

His 'mother' and 'brothers and sister' are listed not only on Jefferson's Slave Census but in distributions of rations and clothing as well. 'Black Tom' supposedly lived at Monticello till 1802, his name most certainly should have appeared in  those records just as the rest of the Hemmings family's names did.<BR>   However the even if the existence of 'Black Tom' were proven it would do the Woodsons no good. The famous DNA tests that proved the Eston Jeffersons are indeed descended from *A* Jefferson male, (possibly Thomas but his brother or nephew is equally probable) also proved that though Thomas Woodson was undoubtedly sired by a white man that man was *not* a Jefferson.<BR>   The Woodson family has chosen to ignore this incontrovertable scientific evidence and cling to their family myth. Frankly I find it pitiable that this extraordinarily accomplished and successful family should be so fixated on a fictitious illegitimate descent from a Founding Father. The achievements of generations of Woodsons, against unbelievable odds, is in itself a heritage to be proud of, they don't need Jefferson's blood to validate their role in American history.	2002-06-10

The catch is you don't just get their medical knowledge but *everything* including their sex drive - which can lead to embarrassing and distracting consequences. In 'Kill or Cure' a Navy rescue team discovers their wreck is 'not of this world'. They do their best to help the injured, sluglike beings inside but do they dare let them contact their friends? An alien species is deliberately formenting military tensions on Earth in 'Red Alert'. Is this a preliminary to invasion? Or is something else going on? In 'Tableau' Earth's first contact with another species results in war. Then an Earth soldier and one of the alien Orligians find themselves trapped together in the wreckage of their ships and discover it's all due to a horrible misunderstanding.

However Rhabwar's first mission is to rescue a Monitor scout ship in distress. It seems like a very simple assignment - until they find out why the ship is in trouble.

The first, 'Accident' is set on the planet Nidia decades before the hospital is built. MacEwan of Earth and Grawlya-Ki of Orligia are *the* heroes of the first, (and hopefully last) interstellar war because they ended it. Trapped together in the wreckage of their crashed spaceships, injured and unlikely to be rescued, they become the first Orligian and Human to actually talk to each other and discover their war is all a simple, horrible misunderstanding. Fortunately they are rescued in time to share their discovery but the mortally wounded MacEwan must be put into stasis until medical science advances enough to save him and Grawlya-Ki choses to join him. The two frozen warriors, still in the remains of their ship, are put on display as one of the most effective War Memorials of all time. They awake over two centuries later to discover they have become icons of the horror of war and the need for peace. But the icons have minds of their own, they disapprove of the rigidly controlled, limited contact between the species that make up the Federation. They argue the races have to really get to know each other, feel comfortable enough with each other to banter and quarrel, or mutual fear will lead to another war. Their views do not prove popular and they are in the process of being politely shipped off Nidia when an accident traps them with a variety of other beings in the wrecked departure lounge. Old soldiers that they are MacEwan and Grawlya-Ki automatically take command of the situation organizing rescue and first aid efforts among the casualties but will help reach them in time? In the next story, 'Survivor', Dr. Conway and the crew of the Ambulance Ship Rhabwar rescue the sole survivor of a space wreck and bring it back to Sector General. Now strange psychological effects are disrupting the hospital, could the alien somehow be to blame? Next the Rhabwar's crew investigates a crashed alien ship whose survivors seem to have suffered mutilations unrelated to their crash injuries in a story aptly titled, 'Investigation'. And finally in 'Combined Operation' the alien ship and the entity inside it are both in pieces and it's going to take the combined forces of Sector General and the Monitor Corps to put them back together again.	2001-07-22

Originally a series of short stories the first, Medic, is a sort of prologue set during the Hospital Station's construction. In it a surly construction worker named O'Mara finds himself treating the Hospital's very first patient. 'Sector General' introduces Dr. Conway, a young, idealistic and rather naive junior physician who has a lot to learn about how the Galactic Federation and the Hospital really function. In 'The Trouble With Emily' Conway is assigned to assist a visiting VIP, Dr. Arretapec, a &quot;levitating ball of goo&quot; with advanced psi powers who refuses to tell Conway exactly what he is trying to accomplish with their 'patient' a perfectly healthy brontosaurian being - nicknamed Emily. In 'Visitor At Large' Conway is in charge of a pediatrics ward and has an assistant of his own; a frail, spiderlike, empathic sensitive called Prilicla. In another ward an exotic being, capable of changing form at will, is dying of an undiagnosed, untreatable condition. The usual rule against visitors is relaxed to allow the entity's child to make a farewell visit to its parent. Unfortunately the welcoming committee of strange looking aliens, including Conway and Prilicla, frightens the youngster into headlong flight. A terrified, immature being, capable of assuming any shape, lost in the multiple levels of Sector General, unable to communicate and worst of all - getting hungry... In 'Out Patient' Conway is promoted to Senior Physician and presented with a new patient; a being of unknown race that is apparently being eaten alive by some kind of cancerous growth.	2001-07-20

This book does not. The focus, unfortunately, is entirely on Ms. Gaamalgard herself the rest of her team are tangential presences at best and she makes no attempt to give rounded portraits or an account of who did what and when. Of course she is not a journalist, unlike Krakauer, so perhaps her concentration on her own experience is understandable. That said experience comes off as vapid and singularly uninvolving may be the fault of Ms. Gaamalgard's writing style or her translator - or both.    It never occured to me to think of this book as 'a woman's point of view', possibly because I don't think in gender catagories, and I would hate to think Ms. Gaamalgard's new age psychobabble was somehow representative of my sex.

An avalanch swept Coombs and his two partners off the side of the mountain, incredibly he survived and, dispite injuries and lost equipment, managed to walk out under his own power. Motivated not simply by a desire to live but by the knowledge that if he died too his dead partners' friends and families would never know what had happened to them.    Bullheaded persistance in the face of physical pain worked for Scott Fischer on K2 but on Everest in '96 the same trait caused his death.    As for Mr. Potterfield's own story, I personally think it's quite reasonable for him to focus on the rescue rather than the cause of the accident. A mistake was made certainly but what's the point in placing blame? Far more important - and more interesting - is the skill and effort that went into rescuing him.

Ged's soliloquy on the way to the final confrontation on Selidor in 'The Farthest Shore' shows not only does he realize what the battle is going to cost him but accepts the price willingly. He is even looking forward to going home to Gont, Ogion and Tenar and perhaps learning what magery could never teach him. A long way from the lost and despairing figure in 'Tehanu'.     Then there's chronology. According to 'The Farthest Shore' it's been about eighteen years since Ged and Tenar brought the ring of Erreth-Akbe back to Havnor, certainly not enough time for Tenar to find a husband, bear two children and raise them to adulthood. Nor does her choice of a simple farmer as a husband seem particularly likely.     A more minor quibble is the fact the Master Summoner survives in 'Farthest Shore' but is suddenly and inexplicably dead in 'Tehanu'.    If Ms. LeGuin didn't care enough to maintain continuity I don't see why I should have to accept this depressing little tome with its stereotypical portrayal of men as oppressors and women as victims as a legitimate sequel to the Earthsea trilogy.	2001-06-25

The dialog is appalling and I definitely could have lived without all the little detours into her personal past. What were her ghost writer and editor thinking? I am also quietly amazed her fellow clients didn't sue for defamation of character. However Ruth Ann's comments on Asian mountaineers merely reflect a widespread and often justified perception that Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese climbers take reckless chances - and all to often pay the price - not personal racism on her part. She also makes it quite clear that her expedition, dispite a close call or two with crevasses and running short on food, was never in serious danger - merely cold, hungry and generally miserable. Still, however safe one may be personally, it isn't pleasant to find oneself surrounded by death and disaster as she did.

Who is the mysterious King of the West? and most unervingly of all - who exactly is Brian Duffy? I love this book it is one of the most convincing blendings of fantasy and history I've ever read.	2001-06-20

Extremely readable. I was somewhat irritated by the doctrinaire Feminist tone of the introduction. Morris' former student takes offense at his calling Heian women 'promiscuous' the fact that they were, and so were the men, is apparently immaterial.	2001-06-12

Ms. Baldwin readily acknowledges she was given every opportunity to 'test her vocation' and back out before commiting herself but failed to take advantage of them because she wished to avoid onerous responsibilities at home. She never says what Order or Congregation she belonged to but from the description of the habit I'd guess she was a Canoness Regular, probably Augustinian.	2001-06-12

As grieving people often do she tries to find a reason for her affliction and decides she is being punished for prefering frivolous literature to serious religious study. Lady Sarashina was apparently not only an enthusiastic reader of romances, such as the Tale of Genji, but authored tales of her own though none have survived. How she wasted her youth reading and writing fictions  is the theme of her retrospective memoir. I like to think the Nikki reflects a passing mood, that Sarashina eventually recovered from her losses and took a more balanced view her past life and involvement with literature.	2001-06-12

A couple of years ago I had the luck of finding a hardcover edition, (in pristine condition I might add) to replace my badly worn paperback copy.    Our narrator is sergeant at arms aboard the merchant spaceship Upskadaska City, known to seasoned spacers as the 'Upsydaisy', making regular voyages between Earth and Venus until holed by an errant glob of space debris that sends the Upsydaisy hurtling directly into the sun. The ship survives thanks to her captain's navigating, the skill of her rather unusual emergency pilot and the grit displayed by all hands.      As a reward captain and crew are given the new interstellar explorer ship 'Marathon' and sent to explore 'strange new worlds' all of which prove somewhat inhospitable to aliens.    Our band of brothers is augmented a staff of government experts and a smart mouthed official photographer. And includes a Martian repair crew, goggle eyed ten tentacled beings who frequently complain about thick air, human odor and want to play chess at the most inopportune times. Dispite frequent interspecies bickering and banter when the chips are down Terran and Martian alike know they can depend on each other to the bitter end.	2001-06-11

I mean would a mature adult call himself 'Alexander Supertramp' and scribble emphatic one liners like 'Jack London is the Man!!' or whatever?    McCandless' self centered self righteousness and feckless indiference to consequences are characteristic of the kind of sheltered upper middle class boy he was. His behavior towards his parents can only be described as deliberately and maliciously cruel and his treatment of the various people who befriend him on his travels isn't much better, he accepts their help but gives little or nothing back. If it were not for the help of strangers he meets along the way his adventure would have ended much sooner than it did.    Oh he was idealistic I grant you, in the half baked counter-cultural way we've had to put up with since the sixties, unlevened by any touch of realism or common sense. And that of course is what killed him. Krakauer is wrong, McCandless wasn't doing 'all right' he was living hand to mouth with no margin of safety at all. If our ancestors had been so improvident the human species would have expired millions of years ago.    McCandless' basic flaw was he didn't take the Wilderness seriously, not seriously enough to adequately prepare himself by studying survival techniques, not seriously enough to dedicate himself to building up a store of food to fall back on, or even thoroughly scout his territory. He was apparently completely unaware of cabins, a ranger station and even a way to cross the flooded river all of which could be found within a six mile radius of his bus. What the heck was he doing all those months? Reading apparently and scribbling callow enthusiasms on every available surface under the impression he was being profound. What he was *not* doing was exploring his territory, locating promising food sources or preparing for emergencies - even afterhe discovered the flooded river blocking his intended trail out.     His fecklessness killed him, which is a pity he was young after all and it is sad he should die of his youthful follies.	2001-05-22

It would seem that Shane is too complex, too 'talky' or too deep for many Jr. High Schoolers assigned to read it. I sympathize, I too was forced to read horrid, dull books by teachers. Most notably Hemingway's 'The Old Man and the Sea' and 'Catcher In the Rye'. But then there's something about being *required* to read a book that almost invariably ruins it.    Shane may indeed be to 'old' for the majority of the twelve to thirteen crowd. Wait five or ten years and try it again, you may like it - or you may still hate it like I still hate 'Old Man and the Sea' and 'Catcher In The Rye'.     I personally read 'Shane' in college thanks to Arthur C. Clark. In his science fiction novel 'A Fall of Moondust' the passengers of a lunar tour bus are trapped in a sea of dust and entertain themselves while waiting for rescue by reading, among other things, 'Shane'. So I tried it and loved it, dispite being no big fan of the Western Genre. It is, quite simply, a wonderful character study.	2001-05-10

Including Dr. Brier but it should be emphasized that his murder theory is pure speculation with no evidential basis whatsoever!! The supposed skull damage is, to say the least, inconclusive and quite possibly post mortem.     We are expected to believe that a dedicated and well rewarded Royal Servant suddenly in his old age develops a hunger for the crown that causes him to murder his own grandchildren to get it. Such an abrupt shift in character is possible of course, due perhaps to a brain tumor, but unlikely to say the least.    In fact the transition from Tutankhamon to a co-regency of Ankhesenamon and Ay seems to have occured smoothly and swiftly, all was settled while the tomb was being decorated, as shown by Ay's image as Pharaoh performing the Opening of the Mouth.     The only evidence for a disputed succession comes from Hittite... texts written some decades after the fact claiming an *unnamed* Queen of Egypt requested a Hittite bridegroom to crown as King. How likely is it that Ankhesenamon would actually *beg* an enemy king to take over her country? Or that she would prefer a 'wretched asiatic' to her own grandfather as co-ruler?	2001-04-29

Her despair is understandable, in their attempts to perform good deeds the six Bastable children and their two friends wreck havoc across the British countryside.
