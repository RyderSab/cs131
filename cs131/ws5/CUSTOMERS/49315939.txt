But to find out what this means, you'll have to look up the history of the word \\"weird\\" when it was still a noun, before the \\"three weird sisters\\" of Macbeth launched the word into its long trek to the adjective we know today.-So it is with much of this work, lots of interesting, fascinating tangents to follow, if one is so inclined.<br /><br />  I think this trilogy succeeds so well primarily because of the writing.-What the character David Staunton calls \\"plain language\\"-The baroque is indeed, \\"not for everybody\\", but more significantly, hard to pull off.  One has to be a Proust or Faulkner to accomplish such a feat.--Lawrence Durrell's The Alexandria Quartet, though fine in many respects, is an example of an author who reached above himself in this regard.<br /><br />  The \\"plain language\\" is so well done that the reader can go through the whole of the middle book, The Manticore, the entirety of which involves the analysis of David Staunton by a Jungian psychiatrist, and finish knowing only a smattering more about Jung and his therapy than he did at the beginning-No \\"race-consciousness\\", \\"archetypes\\" or \\"synchronicity\\". -Again, the reader must delve into this aspect if he or she feels so inclined, after reading the work.-The Manticore also, to me, was the finest of the trilogy, the most deft and interesting, for it forces the reader (or, at least, this reader) to imagine himself in David's position, and I managed to dredge up several (not insignificant) moments from my past that I'd completely forgotten.<br /><br />  So, if you enjoy finely penned, not overly ornate prose, and long nights turning pages, I might add.-Then read and...dree your weird.	2005-10-06

Yes, I thoroughly agree that this is a well-penned novel exploring what Durrell calls \\"modern love\\".  It is also, perhaps above all, a beautiful, harrowing description of a love for a place and time, prewar and immediate postwar Alexandria.  My primary problem with the work lies in the author's stated intent in composing this work, as stated in the Introductory Note to Balthazar, epitomised in one sentence: \\"This in not Proustian or Joycean method-for they illustrate Bergsonian \\"Duration\\" in my opinion, not 'Space-Time'.\\"--Whatever can he mean? I asked myself when first reading this asseveration.  Now, having completed my reading, I ask myself if it means anything at all, this putative appropriation of Einsteinian science to literature.<br /><br />  For this novel is nothing if not Proustian--Indeed, many of the introspective digressions are almost verbatim quotes from Proust.  I don't see how Joyce enters into the picture at all.  This is so clearly a work infused with French and expat French culture intermingling with English and Arabic, that its affiliation with Proust is even more accentuated.  Furthermore, Joyce was never influenced by the Bergsonian notion of \\"Duration.\\" And, though many who write about Proust contend that he was so influenced-He certainly read Bergson, anyway.-the connexion seems very tenuous to me, having read them both myself.<br /><br />  There are a few other problems. At times, this work seems like a pastiche of other works.  The Dickensian-named Pusewarden, for instance, is so obviously, in his style and his philosophy a pale copy of the Doctor from Djuna Barnes's \\"Watchman, What of the Night!\\" chapter of her brilliant book, Nightwood, that it's almost embarrassing to read his declamations.  Of course, he lets his real poetic genius be known to Darley in those letters, subsequently burned.  But we never get to read them!<br /><br />  If Durrell's purpose was to usurp Proust's place as the authority on the prismatic, shape-shifting character of love, modern or otherwise, then he has signally failed.  All one has to do is read Proust to see this.<br /><br />  If, on the other hand, his ambition was to create a delicious, brilliantly wrought and worded, portait of a certain time and place and a depiction of the ever-elusive qualities of the lives and loves therein, he has smashingly succeeded.  Thus, all quibbles aside, it's well worth the read.cter of love, modern or otherwise, then he has signally failed.

He clearly believes or \\"has faith\\" that all that is presented here coheres to form a basis for revolutionizing the current state of affairs.<br /><br />  That being conceded, this drunken boat simply doesn't float (apologies to Rimbaud).  To go so far as to enlist Blake, who was arguably neither Revolutionary nor Romantic save in some oblique chiliastic sense, and is quoted in this very book as stating that, \\"I am really sorry to see my Countrymen trouble themselves about Politics.\\" in a formula for Twenty-First Century revolution is illustrative of how much of this entire argument is rather out on a limb.<br /><br />  The best essay by far is Abensour's essay on William Morris and his News from Nowhere (1890).  Here, the ambiguity inherent in all revolutionary Utopian visions when put into practice is presented with great lucidity.  I would recommend this book for just this one essay.<br /><br />  Sadly, though, the rest of the book seems terribly dated in our \\"post-ideological\\" era. It recurrently turns to sources from the past in hopes of providing a springboard for revolutionary conceptualizations which will alter our world once put into practice.  Given today's state of affairs, such an endeavour will probably only seem worthwhile to, perhaps, soi-disant French intellectuals and cranks in general.<br /><br />  As Christopher Winks points out in his essay on Erich Muhsam, \\"And once intellectuals renounce their potentially greatest asset - their independence - they become incapable of really questioning anything.  Their submission is bought with grants, publisher's advances, lecture tours, and lucrative positions; under these conditions, whatever spark of creativity they may possess is sooner or later snuffed out.\\"-Can anything ring more resoundingly true of our \\"intelligentsia\\" today and in the foreseeable future?<br /><br />  I wish I could be more positive about this book.  But I simply can't while my eyes are open.---Of course, given the cyclical nature of history, there may come a time when books such as this can \\"make a difference\\" as it were.

No reviewer will be able to incorporate the endless nuance upon nuance flickering down the seemingly endless corridors of this mammoth work, and its main character, Gormenghast itself.<br /><br />  For, make no mistake, all other \\"Dickensian grotesques\\" and whatnot to the contrary, Gormenghast itself, in its Parmenidean self-assurance, is the work's raison d'etre. As Peake puts it, \\"This is a love that equals in its power the love of man for a woman and reaches inwards as deeply.  It is the love of a man or of a woman for their world.\\"  This love suffuses Gormenghast. - Let me say here that I disagree in the strongest terms with those reviewers who contend that Titus Alone does not measure up to the previous parts.  For it is this book, in which Titus is in self-imposed exile, that this love of place, of Gormenghast, is thrown into harrowing relief by its very absence, save to the mind's eye, to memory, and thus achieves its fullest effect.<br /><br />  Some reviewers balk at what they see as the incongruous ending of the work. - How incongruous? - Did not his mother proclaim, upun Titus's taking leave, that, \\"There is nowhere else....You will only tread a circle, Titus Groan.  There's not a road, not a track, but it will lead you home.  For everything comes to Gormenghast.\\" And, mirabile dictu, it does for Titus.  The fact that he renounces it again and starts out on another circle is no great surprise.<br /><br />  So, why should you read this book, or series of books? Because it is imbued, like no other work, with what the Ancient Romans called the \\"genius loci\\" or spirit of a place, an almost preternatural sense of this, sometimes anguished, love and longing, will seep into your bones as you meander through these pages. And, in the end, Gormenghast, with all its crankiness and folderol, will come to represent for you the places you have loved and perhaps lost, but always return to in your mind's eye.<br /><br />Peake was, indeed, a Genius of Place.br />  So, why should you read this book, or series of books?

It is so well researched that the last 70 pages of the book comprise a bibliography of the sources Ekirch quotes throughout the book.  Herein lies my problem with this work.  Its principal matter lies in quotation followed by cumbrously segued quotation.  In other words, until the last few pages, there's no authorial voice to speak of, and it makes for disparate, humdrum reading.  The best thing about it, by far, is the wealth of illustrations, mostly by Flemish artists, which shed more light, if you'll excuse the expression, on things than do a hundred quotations.<br /><br />Summing up: A carefully researched, scholarly work that takes no risks.<br /><br />If the reader is truly interested in this sort of thing, Robert Burton's age-old The Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), a study of such things as went on in the night and other matters pertaining thereto, is the far more engrossing and erudite read.	2005-08-31

I've already had two previous reviews to do that....and everyone who has made it thus far knows quite thoroughly Stephenson's scope and craft.<br /><br />The only think left for me is to make a, perhaps superficial or redundant to some, point considering this trilogy as literature.  An article appeared in the New York Times a couple weeks ago pointing out that literary fiction had gone the way of the dinosaur and the blimp, that periodicals such as Harper's and The Atlantic were publishing less and less of it and, in lieu thereof, publishing non-fiction, because, as one editor put it, (paraphrasing) \\"Fiction seems no longer germane to our world.\\"  The only exception that was noted in the article was \\"escapist\\" fiction dealing with other times, eras, worlds etc.---In which case, Stephenson may have laid the groundwork here for what much of what will be called Twentieth-First Century literature will be all about.<br /><br />But, of course, it will NOT be literature in any proper sense of the word: Just well-written, carefully researched, picaresque fun.<br /><br />I think Stephenson is clearly aware of this.  I invite the reader to pay close attention to the John Wilkins quote just before the Acknowledgements page toward the end of the book under HERE ENDS THE BAROQUE CYCLE:<br /><br />\\"....the vanity of this age is more taken with matters of curiosity, than those of solid benefit. Such a pamphlet as this, may be salable, when a more substantial and useful discourse is neglected.\\"<br /><br />Quite.<br /><br />Still, no mean feat to have written a 3,000 page \\"pamphlet\\" that keeps us \\"curious\\" to the end.	2005-08-27

There is not as much science (or, excuse me, Natural Philosophy) in this book as in Quicksilver, which disappointed me a bit, as I enjoyed those sections immensely.  But, then again, this book covers a tome period when the Royal Society was in decline, Newton was verging on madness, and Leibniz was concerned with his philosophy of windowless monads(q.v. - if you're interested, Bertrand Russell's A History of Western Philosophy and the chapter on Leibniz therein), a scientific cul-de-sac, as it turned out.  Stephenson's historical knowledge never ceases to amaze me.  Having just read Macaulay's history, which covers roughly the same time period in England, I can assure the reader that Stephenson is spot on, especially about the battles Bob Shaftoe takes part in Ireland.  On the other hand, verbal anachronisms abound.  Just for example, a \\"haymaker,\\" meaning a roundhouse delivery by fist or sword or other object, didn't enter the language until the early twentieth century.  Then again, I learned a new word.<br /><br />  But all this is really beside the point, which is that Stephenson's picaresque style is just fun to read, all literary pretensions aside.  Comparing him with David Foster Wallace (as another reviewer does) is comparing dates and pomegranates.  These books, the Baroque trilogy, though perhaps \\"literary\\" in some quaint sense of that word, don't make any stuffy claims for themselves. ---Some devotees may makes these claims for them, but leave them to it.<br /><br />  As for me, I'm off for more fun in my newly purchased copy of The System of the World.	2005-08-18

Then, it's for you. - Otherwise, this book is simply a pale shadow of Blood Meridian.<br /><br /> Chigurh, the \\"psychopathic\\" killer, is such an obvious, watered-down replacement for The Judge in Blood Meridian that he's much more than an embarassment in this novel. - He even uses the exact wording as does The Judge about the \\"right currrency\\" not being money.  It's blood, of course.  But Chigurh is no Judge.  He's already boxed into this meaningless diagnosis of \\"psychopathic\\" near the beginning of the book; whereas the Judge is the moving philosophical protagonist in Blood Meridian and remains a Delphic figure to the end.  Without The Judge, there would be no Blood Meridian.-If you don't buy all this, try thinking of Chigurh as Delphic, in that adjective's original sense.  It quite obviously just won't do.<br /><br />  McCarthy should have ceased writing after Suttree, to my mind his greatest work, perhaps even the greatest postwar American novel of the Twentieth century.  His books have diminished increasingly in quality since he found megastar success with The Border Trilogy.

Yes, as everyone agrees, or, I should say, almost everyone, this is a well-written, suspenseful historical novel.  The inherent and ineluctable problem with books of this genre, though, is where to draw the line between the history and the suspense.  It seems to me that Ms. Kostovo has done a very fine job of this, as fine as can be done with this type of work.  But, there's a bit of a catch here, for to me the real subject of this book is not the story, as such, or Dracula, or Vlad The Impaler, but history itself-More to the point, what is wrought by the fascination with history.<br /><br />  In scene after scene, the charaters suffer flashbacks from hundreds, almost a thousand in a few episodes, years ago.  They experience them as if they were reliving them, conveyed to us through Ms. Kostova's luminous historical prose.<br /><br />  In other words, the entire history of vampirism is a rather meretricious way of involving us in what it is like, not to be a mere academic student of history, but to be thoroughly enthralled with it.  Anyone who has suffered from this bite (three bites?) will know what I mean:  One travels in distant lands, walks the earth aware of mortal man's fleetingness in a distrait state of mind pondering the great events and mysteries of the past, so vivid in the mind's eye, the present becoming a shadowland filled with fleeting figures engulfed by the hundreds of years one has lived through in one's own mind and imagination.<br /><br />  Ms. Kostova, of course, is well aware of the pitfalls of this enchantment. One becomes very much like a, well, you know....or should, after reading this book.	2005-08-03

But, as my current budget couldn't quite stomach the cost of the full five volumes, I settled on this edition.<br /><br />This reservation having been asseverated, this is as fine an abridged edition of Macaulay's History as one is likely to find. Trevor-Roper does a splendid job of pointing out the prejudicial and less than honest accounts associated with Macaulay's unforgiving Whig triumphalism, and the book does, as has been mentioned by the other reviewers, read quite well.  One only regrets the truncations and what not associated with the abridged version.<br /><br />Try Hume if you fancy a well-written history from the other side of the political spectrum-Also, Churchill's History of The English Speaking Peoples.	2005-07-21

Mr. Burgess must have made his remark about its being \\"one of the top five novels of the century\\" back when it was first published.  Yes, the plot, such as it is, involves a sort of archeological hoax.  But the novel is primarily a farcical comedy regarding the English classes and their uses of language in post WWII England-I think that this must be why Burgess, that linguistic connoiseur took a fancy to it.<br /><br />It reads like an Austen novel with a bit of Wodehouse thrown in.  But, these nuances that this book captures so well no longer exist, even for most of the English.  And for Americans, the book must be a rather boring schlep of a novel indeed.  How many of them know that when one \\"drawls\\" in England, one is taking a supercilious upper-class accent such as the \\"Oxford drawl\\"?-It is these minutiae that are so essential in \\"getting\\" the book that will leave many readers on either side of the pond in the year 2005 scratching their heads rather than chuckling, I fear.<br /><br />3 stars for capturing the minutiae.  But, essentially, this is a boook of ephemera, focusing on the inflections and manners of a bygone era.	2005-07-14

Upon finishing the book, I can see why.  The gist of this book is that the way to a sort of knowledge of God or immortality is a completely irrational (or perhaps a-rational conveys more the sense in English) struggle with God (rather than the idea of God)and the notion of immortality and thereby achieve the knowledge and FEELING attained by the great mystics.---This is indeed very much in the tradition of Wordsworth's famous Ode.<br /><br />But Wordsworth's ode was not concerned with a particular religion.  Unanumo's book is. This leads to a number of curiosities that are rather hard to swallow.  First, of course, is that only Roman Catholics can experience such feelings.  Second is his denunciation of Nietsche, whom he very much resembles, particularly when he expatiates on suffering as a good. Methinks he is a bit more influenced by Nietzsche than he likes to admit.  In fact,I was reminded of that tragic German philosopher on every page.  But, of course, no Roman Catholic can admit that he has been influenced by Nietzsche.<br /><br />It is encouraging to read someone who dumps the metaphysical muck of the Scholastics etc in the rubbish bin, and also confirms Hume against Kant and others who have supposedly \\"refuted\\" him. They have done nothing of the sort, but only spun more meaningless metaphysical webs.<br /><br /> So, all in all, a bit of a mixed bag.  But recommended reading, if only because there's nothing else quite like it.	2005-07-11

My take on this novel is a tad different from other reviewers, the reason being that I've read what the academics skewered in this novel would call its \\"subtext\\"-if that word isn't out of vogue already-Hogg's Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, the book our protagonist here, Nelson, is doing his dissertation on.  It is one of the most passing strange, and, as rightly noted by another reviewer anent this book...weird books I've ever read.<br /><br />  The novel does work well, of couse, as a send-up of modern academia.  But one moans a bit as one laughs. This IS truly the way things are in the academy now, and many of the characters are based on actual people who have had their fifteen seconds of academic fame. But I don't think this is the primary concern of the novel.<br /><br />  I'm not going to go into a thorough explication of Hogg's book here, in part because I've already reviewed it, but also because I think that every reader should have a look at it for his/her self before reading this book.  Let's just say that it concerns a character obsessed with the Scotch Calvinist idea of predestination who is led by the devil, or so he thinks, to commit truly bizarre atrocities.<br /><br />There is a reason that Nelson, our protagonist and narrator, mentions that \\"weird\\" comes from an Anglo-Saxon noun meaning, roughly, Fate.  What \\"really\\" happens to Nelson in this novel? Is it his \\"weird\\" to undergo what happens to him like the character in Hogg's novel thinks of himself, or no?<br /><br />I don't have the answer to these questions.  But I do know that books like this make one ponder how weird one's own life is when reflected upon and to run again over British scientist JBS Haldane's famous remark that, \\"Not only is the universe stranger than we imagine it.  It's stranger than we CAN imagine it.\\"<br /><br />I'll leave it there, much as the book does, scratching my head in perplexity.	2005-07-07

The classic of all English language Bildungsromans (generally conceded) is Joyce's Portait of The Artist As A Young Man where Joyce tells with a passionate, lyrical intensity what it was like for him (under the guise of alter-ego Stephen Dedalus) growing up in Dublin and coming to realise his calling as an artist using, famously, \\"silence, exile and cunning\\" to further that end.<br /><br />  There is also more than a bit of the picaresque to this novel, with the madcap rush of Duddy to grab his land by any means possible.  But, alas, two things make this novel less than satisfactory or even, in the end, pleasing to read:<br /><br />1) The writing. In contrast to Joyce or Thomas Wolfe or any other number of novelists who sketched their youth in a poetic lyricism that redeems even the protagonist's worst character flaws, Kravitz writes in a terse, hard-bitten prose that is rather off-putting (understatement) and exaggerates rather than casts into relief Kravitz's many small-minded, unfeeling, avaricious flaws.<br /><br />2.) Duddy Kravits himself is IMPOSSIBLE TO LIKE.  This might be an advantage for a character in a book like The Brothers Karamazov, where we have several characters interacting throughout the novel, some with rather bad character traits indeed, or in a novel like Donleavy'y The Ginger Man whose ptotagonist's faults are compensated by his humanity and the beautiful writing.  But when the character is the raison d'etre for the book without many redeeming qualities at all (I mean, not even \\"bad\\" ones with which one finds one's self sympathising) and the writing, which reminded me of bricklaying, only exacerbates the situation, it's time to hang it up....Period.<br /><br />For any readers who didn't fancy this book but still admire bildungsroman, picaresque anti-hero type of things, I couldn't do better than recommend Irish-American author J.P.

Autobiographical fiction can be wonderful stuff.  But this book just doesn't cut it, because the vignettes are so blasted BORING.  Prime example,\\"The Leaf\\", where the reader plods on through over 50 pages and nothing happens save for the recounting of the petty tribulations of the mail censorship office.  The one exception is a story where something tragic does occcur between two American clergy, one a Baptist one a Catholic.  If all the stories were as psychologically acute as this one and as masterfully told, I would be giving this book 5 blazing stars.  But they're not.<br /><br />Essentially, Burns mines the old Henry James theme of Americans losing their sense of exceptionalism in Europe.  I kept being reminded of James's The Ambassadors in slapdash form.<br /><br />I think the only type of person who can probably fully appreciate this book are those, like William Zinsser, who wrote the intro to my copy of the book, who were there at the same place, same time and for whom it is \\"their\\" WWII.<br /><br />Otherwise, it makes for crashing dull reading.	2005-06-29

Mostly because, as the introduction so aptly puts it, Murdoch's main concern is with morality.  This makes the book, like most of Murdoch's others, a bit of a throwback.  But she does manage to pull it off.  The \\"morality\\" of the situation is mentioned time and time again by Arrowby with no hint of irony or self-parody.<br /><br />Perhaps the best way to approach this book is by realising what it is not: It is NOT Wuthering Heights.  It is that book's antithesis.  Like Arrowby, Heathcliff loses the childhood love of his life in Emily Bronte's classic, and the passion remains with him still to the end of his tortured life.  But he does not relent to the world.  He remains the Romantic, Byronic individualist to the end.  Whatever you think of him , he is the book's hero and sine qua non.<br /><br />Arrowby is the opposite.  He gives into the world.  He is weaker than Heathcliff and is overcome both by his own pettiness and the \\"withness\\" of the world, as Wordsworth would have it.  I know that this is supposed by some to be a sort of \\"purifying\\" process for him.  But I'm not buying.  What this work is, then, is anti-Romantic, (capital R)and anti-individualistic.<br /><br />If the Wuthering Heights comparison doesn't convince you, just think of what Nietzsche would have thought of Arrowby as compared to his Ubermensch.<br /><br />But things are not quite so simply dichotomous.  Murdoch has clearly read Proust, and she incorporates quite well the fleetingness of memory into Arrowby's, shall we say, past love and psyche, but to her own ends, which are again, the opposite of Proust's.  Arrowby goes in search of lost time and gets defeated utterly.  Proust goes in search of of lost time and comes upon a new sort of consciousness and becomes an artist-hero, very much as Nietzsche envisioned such a person.<br /><br />In the end, as in all her books, Murdoch comes out against such enterprises as self destructive and MORALLY wrong.  If you can swallow that about her, you'll fancy the books she seemed to churn out like a sausage machine during her lifetime. If not, you shan't.<br /><br />Proust's avowed concept in writing his 3,000 page magnum opus was in demonstrating \\"the unreality of the perceptible world\\".  Murdoch, who was, after all, a Philosophy, not Literature, professor, has quite a different aim.  As Wordsworth puts it, \\"The world is too much with us\\" and we lay waste our powers, so he rhymes it, by allowing such to be the case.  So it is with Murdoch and her characters.  The world, society and an odd sort of morality have too much power over them and her characters.<br /><br />  There is also her recurrent reliance on The Tempest here, which makes so many of the other reviewers get the feeling that it is \\"contrived.\\"  It is.  If she only used The Tempest in one book, all good and well.  But she uses it as a crutch in every book.<br /><br />In the end, a good morality tale, for those who like such, but not great literature.you can swallow that about her, you'll fancy the books she seemed to churn out like a sausage machine during her lifetime.

For Daphne is much more Ariel than Prospero, as the title and quote at the beginning should more than slightly hint.<br /><br />Ariel's songs have long been an inspiration to poets and poetic writers (Shelley and John Clare come to mind)for their inspired linguistic beauty and magical quality. The sense one gets from all these writers is that the \\"normal\\" way of seeing things is not quite spot on, that there is a magic, delightful and disturbing, by turns, undercurrent to our quotidian perceptions.<br /><br />Janet Frame, in this book, manages to lyrically, poetically convey that Ariel-inspired sense better than anyone in any novel I've yet to read.<br /><br />Yes, the hospital setting and what not is harrowing.  But Daphne's description of her stay there is deep and magical and wonderful....So is the rest of the book.....Buy it this summer, \\"merrily\\", as Ariel would have it.	2005-06-18

He has managed to truncate or abbreviate or stop in medias res every \\"essay\\" he has selected.--Most of these aren't essays, properly speaking, in any event, but snippets culled from larger pieces of work.<br /><br />The greatest abomination resultant from this culling process is the selection from Proust's opening remarks of Remembrance of Things Past, which Mr. Neider has found himself pleased to entitle \\"waking dreams.\\"  He doesn't allow us to get to the famous Proustian epiphany in re the madeleine to which the \\"waking dreams\\" are building, but snips it before any one who has not read Proust has any idea exactly what he's going on about.---Similar axing of the other authors abounds.<br /><br />A surprising number of these essays are about strangers in a strange land: Kipling on Chicago, Heine on London, Hawthorne on London, Dickens on New York, Stevenson on the California coast, Sartre on New York, Wilde on America in general---\\"They all look as if they're running to catch a train.\\"<br /><br />It was a bit of a bracer to reread Hemingway's \\"Death in the Afternoon\\" which the Mr. Neider left entire and which was a pleasant jolt of terse, to the point, anchored prose that, in contrast to the other circuitous and free-floating \\"essays\\", nearly took one's breath away.<br /><br />In sum, then, a hodgepodge of literary/travel cuttings that leave one a little more than disappointed	2005-06-16

You'll also know all sorts of minutiae and what not about his private life and relations with others, particularly females.<br /><br />Many biographies err on the side of over-psychoanalysing the author.  This one, or so it seems to me, errs a tad much on the side of caution in this regard.<br /><br />There are some good anecdotes: Particularly the pilgrimage of a pot-smoking Martin Amis and his topless girlfriend to visit the nonplussed Fowles, but somewhow one wants more than the very competenty documented story of his somewhat humdrum outer life.-I mean, one wants at least a little speculation as to his inner world.<br /><br />I think the most insightful bit I read here was a quote from Fowles's diary regarding how every author is the Prospero immersed in the magical world of his creation.<br /><br />What I would recommend to any reader searching for deeper insight is simply to go back and read his books, particularly The Magus (preferably after rereading The Tempest.)---His inner life is all THERE.-This biography supplies the, not too suprising, real world correlations to the characters and situations therein.<br /><br />Ultimately, this biography is very fine and competent.  But perhaps a bit too fine and competent.  I wish Ms. Warburton would have put herself on the line a bit more, offered a few of her own speculations, perhaps been a bit more like Fowles himself.	2005-06-11

So, I suppose one must take the well-written with the tendentious.<br /><br />  For those looking for a more brilliant modern novel heavily influenced by The Tempest, may I humbly recommmend The Magus by John Fowles whose wriring is brilliant, and the \\"message\\" of which will leave you pondering long after you put the book down.	2005-06-06

This novel is so many things -  All of them wonderful and wonderfully executed by Ms Clarke - that it's hard to know where to begin or end in a review.  Firstly, the book is and is about: ENCHANTMENT.  It's also so very, very English and droll, that it can be seen, in the agglomeration of all its contradictory characters, as a take on England and the English Character.<br /><br />The book's literary ancestors are obvious: Tolkien, Dickens, Susan Cooper-and, I should say, the \\"High Romantic\\" poets of the Early Nineteenth Century in general.  Clarke is a master of setting out verbal tableaux in masterful, lush prose, at capturing shades of light and dark---I was reminded of Shelley's \\"Ode to the West Wind\\" many a time.<br /><br />She is also the master of droll English understatement. As an example: \\"Early in November 1814 Mr Norell was honoured by a visit from some very noble gentlemen - an earl, a duke and two baronets - who came, they said, to speak to him upon a matter of the utmost delicacy and were so discreet themselves that half an hour after they had begun talking Mr Norell was still entirely ignorant of what they wished him to do.\\"<br /><br />It is a book that, if you are of a....hm.....poetic or \\"magical\\" temperament, will cast its spell on you from the first to last page. You shall be transported to scenes such as: \\"On a day in late December when storm clouds made Alpine landscapes in the sky above London, when the wind played such havoc in the heavens that the city was one moment plunged in gloom and in the next illuminated by sunlight......\\"<br /><br />These are the things that make the book truly great. The plot is also very well executed.  But if you're in search of the Harry Potter sort of thing, then you, like the society patricians at the soirees  asking for some \\"magic\\" acts to be performed for their diversion, had best look elsewhere.<br /><br />  The magic in this book is the sort that makes you look at the tree limbs in relief against an evening sky with a chill wind picking up and get a sense that there might be something more to things than you can quite make out.<br /><br />My apologies to John Donne for stealing this review's title.an evening sky with a chill wind picking up and get a sense that there might be something more to things than you can quite make out. <br /> <br />My apologies to John Donne for stealing this review's title. <br />	2005-01-15

Others may find it soporific.  Others may find it a splendidly sustained tone.  I find it a bit of all three, though the latter trumps the other two qualities in the end.<br /><br />The reason I'm emphasizing tone so much here is that this is actually more of a meditation than what is generally considered a novel. Thus, the question arises as to what this book is all about really.  Yes, on a certain level, father-son relations, as many of the under a deadline editorial writers were quick to point out.  It could also, superficially, be cast as a book about prodigal sons, pacifism vs. wars against Evil and many other things.<br /><br />Yet, I would submit, the book is essentially a long \\"crepuscular\\" meditation on love and time.  Furthermore, a subterranean anomic current runs throughout the letters which one must read closely to catch.<br /><br />Consider the following:<br /><br />  \\"There is no justice in love, no proportion in it, and there need not be, because in any specific instance it is only a glimpse or parable of an embracing, incomprehensible reality.  It makes no sense at all because it is the eternal breaking in on the temporal.  So how could it subordinate itself to cause or consequence?\\" (p.258)<br /><br />\\"And memory is not strictly mortal in its nature, either.  It is a strange thing, after all, to be able to return to a moment, when it can hardly be said to have any reality at all, even in its passing\\" (p.162)<br /><br />Such are the meditations of our crepuscular writer, hardly the musings of your average country parson.  In fact, for those truly appreciative of the deep undercurrents here, I could do no better than recommend Proust, not Willa Cather.<br /><br />This is a haunting, lovely novel for those who take the time and, frankly, are able to appreciate fine writing.  Nevertheless, only four stars for a fault that is rather obvious from the outset, the inability to separate Rev. Ames from Ms. Robinson, especially for those who have read her previous, non-fiction works. A proselytizing note too frequently jars the splendour of the writing.moment, when it can hardly be said to have any reality at all, even in its passing\\" (p.162) <br /> <br />Such are the meditations of our crepuscular writer, hardly the musings of your average country parson.

Trust me, if you adore verbal arcana, the editor (viz. Robbins) has left enough unexplicated for you to go running to your unabridged OED time and time again.  If his notes and explanations are short, all the more reason to rejoice in such need for recourse into other resources to delve into the verbal rich and strange.<br /><br />That being said, methinks the best, most philosophic and topical section of this compilation is the second part of Religio Medici, the first part of which is, for the most part, involved with theological abstrusities none too cogent to the modern reader due to the discoveries of modern science among other reasons.  The second part, by contrast, abounds with speculation and contemplation cogent and arresting to all ages.<br /><br />As for Hydriotaphia and The Garden of Cyrus, let's just say that if differing forms of burial in antiquity and the reasons pertaining thereto pique your interest, or if you're obsessed that the number five in the form as its displayed on the side of a die may hold the key to the cosmos, as another reviewer has felicitously noted, you will be amply rewarded.  Otherwise, well, you may find yourself dozing at parts.<br /><br />Aside from the delight in outdated and antiquated wording and a unique style of writing that I haven't seen duplicated anywhere, even in the works of Browne's most illustrious contemporaries, the best reason to buy this book is for insights like those below interlarded throughout the text:<br /><br />Life itself is but the shadow of death, and souls departed but the shadows of the living.

It's just that one becomes rather frustrated with reading such fascinating conceptualizations of the nature of different aspects of the cosmos only to read in the end that \\"of course this can't be verified as of yet, maybe never.\\"  After a while, one is overcome by this creepy feeling of rereading a slightly less whimsical version of \\"Through The Looking Glass\\"-Lewis Carroll had a degree in Mathematics from Oxford as well.<br /><br />The physicist Richard Feynman (whom Greene clearly admires) once described theoretical physics as \\"imagination in a straight jacket.\\" Greene seems to have cast off the straight jacket and decided to chase after what may turn out to be, after all, white rabbits.	2004-12-18

It's fun to read or skim through the anecdotal etymologies provided, even if, at the end of the entry, Hendrickson admits that they're probably apocryphal.  The only two criticisms I have of this 2004 edition are that there are far too many ephemeral entries from the last few years that probably won't outlive the decade and, secondly, Hendrickson is a wee bit too obviously a baseball fanatic and there is far too large a proportion of baseball-derived entries than is merited - Aside from these two small criticisms, an irresistible compilation of words, phrases and the stories (true or not) behind them.	2004-12-10

Soucy manages not to go off the cliff with the absurdist elements, and life is, after all, more than a bit absurd at times.<br /><br />  The notes attached to the end of my edition of the book compare it to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.  Thematically, this is true. The problem is that, unlike Frankenstein, one doesn't have much of a clue as to what constitutes the theme until the tag end of the book.  I think a better comparison, based on the books stylistic merits, is to Marquez.  But the book is really too sui generis for any pat comparison of this sort.  It's too real for Magical Realism, and too random to compare to any Victorian novel.<br /><br />Reading it, I was reminded of \\"probability waves\\" that graduate students in physics deal in.

But it's not.<br /><br />Certainly, the book has suspense that keeps us turning the relatively few pages -All good and well- What one needs to pay attention to is the use of words and the speculations of the narrator.  Many of these words are real, and not mistaken or authorial tropes.  They just haven't been used, according to the OED, since the Middle Ages. Examples: houpland, brackmard, etc.<br /><br />So, what is the author trying to evoke in us? Well, yes, the \\"Fair Punishment\\" is rather gruesome.  But we've all either read or seen the film of The English Patient by now, right?  Philosophers typically present us with what the Germans call a Weltanschauung, or worldview.  What is the worldview one comes away with from reading this book? That's the question the reader needs to ask his or her self.<br /><br />Our narrator gives us some interesting speculation: \\"I'm not afraid of things that turn out the wrong way and interfere with the everyday matters of this world, it's a change from the pervading decrepitude and the way all things insist on wearing down, if that's what I'm trying to say.\\".......Is this what she's trying to say?  Towards the end, she speaks of her unborn child \\"howling its name to demand its portion on this wreck of a planet, I took refuge in my pencil as is my wont.  For what is there to do in this life but write for nothing?\\"<br /><br />What indeed?fe but write for nothing?\\" <br /> <br />What indeed? <br />	2004-12-04

Indeed, if Ms. Urquhart had simply made a novella out of the first chapter and entitled it A Fish On A Pool, it would be a first rate artistic achievement.  Instead, she drones on in two subsequent chapters in a lyricism that eventually fails through repetition, a plot that grates through being, well, the same blasted plot repeated three times and a theme that becomes not a little over the top in its  literary feminism.<br /><br />  This review is not the place to go into all of Ms. Urquhart's gifts and how she has wasted them after the first, astounding chapter.  She has a lyrical gift that owes much to Yeats. -In fact, the words \\"changed utterly\\" occur twice in this book-which, if you are a lover of Irish poetry and, ergo, a lover of Yeats, cannot fail to strike a chord. Hint: Read his Easter 1916.  There are also passages like these in the first chapter, \\"Dark morning birds lifted away from the earth she walked on, her words spinning in the sky then flying over the fields to the shore\\".  The first chapter is thematically wild and entrancing and lyrically virtuosic.<br /><br />  But then......who knows?  Maybe her publisher demanded a certain number of pages.  In any event, she goes on in two flat, pat chapters about the same thing with less magic and more of an axe to grind.  She flirts with feminist propaganda near the end.  Only the woman can receive the enchanting gift of being \\"away\\" it would seem.  And men turn out to be destroyers of themselves and/or the land around them, unless, of course, they happen to be American Indian and go by the none too subtle name of \\"Exodus\\".<br /><br />  Still, the book is worth it.  Just stop after the first chapter while you're still enchanted and before disillusionment has set in, while you're still \\"away.\\"	2004-12-03

Cahill's choice of wording tends to jar at times:  \\"yip-yapping\\" and \\"woo-woo wave\\" for example.  He rather goes over the top in trying to make this book as \\"cool\\" as possible. And his quotations from Yeats and others throughout the book presume a level of cultivation with which this cutesy verbiage is at odds.  Still, one could do much worse.  He manages to convey, at times, forcefully, some of the most significant and powerful currents of Greek art, thought and culture. But, in the end, the best way to learn about the Greeks is from the Greeks: Thucydides, Plato Euripides etc.  If this book piques your interest at all, I would recommend picking up any one of the fine translations of these authors' works.  If not, well, I suppose it's all Greek to you.	2004-05-14

But, being the rather rum fellow that I am, I read the book from cover to cover and must report that it makes a dashed good read, at least for the peculiar bunch who, like myself, enjoy reading through such compilations.  Just one fascinating example:  I should never have known, had I not read through the work, that, according to ancient folklore, \\"A man who sees them becomes possessed by nymphs.  They punish unresponsive lovers....\\" or that \\"Around 400 BC inscriptions mention Archedemus from Thera....who withdrew to a cave to devote himself to a monklike worship of the Nymphs.\\"  Clearly, entries like these prove rich ground for pondering male/female relations.  And this is just one example!  The perfect book for the Classicist near you....or perhaps yourself.	2004-05-13

The account of the long evolution of this mammoth undertaking with all the equally eccentric and assiduous characters involved over the generations of tedious, loving work it took to complete could have become a mammoth volume itself.  Instead, Winchester manages to provide us with a provocative page-turner which can be read in an afternoon, over tea and scones preferably.  I would say that this book is a must for anyone who owns a copy of the OED or is simply infatuated with words.  But, in keeping with the genteel tradition of English Lexicography as evinced here: Descriptive not Prescriptive, as the rather hidebound American dictionaries tend to be, I shall refrain.  I rather deem the book a pleasant Prologue, much as Chaucer uses the term in, let's see...circa 1374.	2004-05-12

First: An answer to a rather negative reviewer's cluelessness about the title.  Obviously he/she didn't bother to read Eco's Postscript in which he says, among other things, \\"I liked it because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meaning that by now it hardly has any meaning left\\" and \\"A title must muddle the reader's ideas, not regiment them.\\"  It is generally a wise idea to read a book in its entirety before reviewing it.<br />I fancied the book for the most part.  It is much like Eco's other work, rich in (to me) fascinating historic detail, which, as another reviewer has pointed out, is not mere historic detail, but rather pertains poignantly to our own day and age.  But I have the opposite of what seems to be the other reviewers' problem with the novel.  The \\"detective story\\" somewhat detracted from the novel rather than vice-versa.  One catches whiffs of the Brother Cadfael series here and there and some rather transparent Hollywood/BBC plot props which rather detract from one's appreciation.  But I suppose this is the reason it is the only one of Eco's books to be made into a film.  In the end, if you truly enjoy literature and reflection, any of Eco's other novels are far superior to this one.  On the other hand, if you enjoy detective stories and strong plotlines than this is no doubt the only work of his for you.  But I shan't try to regiment things either for the prospective reader.  Perhaps you'll find some special nuances here that a necessarily brief review like this one can't cover. -- 4 Rosy Stars.	2004-05-11

In general, I was spot on.  See here, if you don't enjoy immersing yourself in the arcana and minutiae of the Middle Ages, if you don't enjoy taking off through the picaresque pages of a book as if upon a fiery charger bent on some epic quest, regardless of the exhilarating fact that you don't quite know where you are heading, than this book is not for you---Neither is the classic, Don Quixote, I might add---But if you do enjoy such adventures, saddle up with ye olde lance in hand and prepare for a richly imaginative trek.-I might also add that I found the story of Baudolino's love for Hypatia quite beautiful and moving in its own right. 5 Swirling stars!	2004-05-10

But, in the end, I think Boswell's biography of Johnson and his other writings (The famous Boswell papers etc) actually reveal more about the man than any biography of Boswell himself I've run across.  Martin's accounts of Boswell's seemingly pathological obsession with sex and death make interesting reading, as accounts of sex and death generally do; but couldn't we have more reflection from the biographer here on these matters, a bit more involvement with the subject than the encomia noted by another reviewer?  Boswell's ghost is still searching for a biographer as good as he.	2004-05-09

Surely, you could not have picked up a book with a title like this with the idea that you were going to encounter a detailed technical account of a new way to do triple integrals with multiple variables, replicate DNA using some newfound technique or plumb the depths of cosmological philosophy.  The author states his intentions in the Introduction: To give the non-specialist an understandable overview of what scientists have discovered about our universe.  This Bryson does in a most enjoyable fashion.  I would recommend this book to anyone, even Science Ph.D.'s, who simply enjoy lucid, competent, witty writing about what we know.  I simply don't understand why those who obviously don't enjoy such works bothered to buy, read, and review the book in such a sneering, unctuous manner.  - I don't buy or review Harlequin romances, condemning them for not being on a par with Shakespeare.---Four stars.

The characters don't \\"learn\\" anything.  What, one might well ask, is the \\"moral\\" of Hamlet?  What  does he learn? What is the \\"morality\\" of Wuthering Heights?  What does Heathcliff learn? How about Joyce's Ulysses? Moral anyone?  - Reading the reviews, one begins to suspect that a group of frustrated Sunday school teachers got together to compose them.<br />The fact that there is no \\"moral\\" to the novel is another of its attributes.  Has anyone else caught on to the fact that Norma Joyce's surname might be significant? Or how about the Hardy family? - It should be apparent to anyone reading this novel with the slightest knowledge of English literature that Hay's greatest literary influence, along with her character Norma Joyce's, is Thomas Hardy, who is mentioned in the work several times as Norma's favourite author.  The book resembles nothing so much as Hardy's Jude the Obscure - A feminine version of Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage is another apt comparison. - The wonderfully told narrative maintains its artistic strength through its mirroring of reality.  I can put it no better than Hay in her description of Maurice's falling in temporary love/lust with Norma:<br />  \\"Probably it happens fairly often, falling in love in a dream.  You wake up with an appetite for someone you might not even like.  But in the dream there was sex, and upon waking, the idea of sex, and from then on that person is on your mind in an entirely new way.\\"<br />  In other words, life, like a dream, just rather happens to one, for good or ill----And how accurately Hay describes it!  Let's hope that the moralists out there don't discourage Hay from writing another novel, as they did Thomas Hardy after he penned Jude the Obscure.<br />Four stars because the book doesn't quite measure up to the masterpiece of which I feel certain Hay is capable of giving us.y is capable of giving us.	2004-05-07

The problem with apocalyptic or \\"prescient\\" novels, in general, is that they walk a fine line between prescience and absurdity.  Ms. Atwood certainly shows, in what was for me a compelling narrative, that she still has the stuff of which great writers are made, and the book manages to be thought-provoking as well.  But a good many of the thoughts provoked tend to be a bit barmy upon further reflection: The possibility of a future filled with rather goofily named genetically engineered animals, for instance.  The other reviewers have pretty much covered the literary ancestry of such novels.  Orwell's greatly overrated 1984, for instance.  It's 2004. Do we live in such a society that Orwell warned against or was predicting?  Huxley's Brave New World is a much better comparison (and book) to Oryx And Crake.  But still...Do we live in such a world?  We are still reading books and even writing reviews of them in our spare time.  It is well to remember that Huxley took his title from a line in one of Shakespeare's most fantastical plays, The Tempest.  So, in the end, I would read the book for its fine writing and compelling story.  Clearly, from the afterword, Writing Oryx And Crake, affixed to the end of my copy, Atwood was shooting a bit \\"higher\\" than this level.  Perhaps it is a disease of established literary figures to feel the need to explain some grand design pertaining to the future of humanity in their works.  But all this \\"slippery slope\\" business is a slippery slope in itself.  Just read and enjoy.	2004-05-06

Come now, does anyone save a literary groupie really appreciate all this display of superficial literary knowledge? Is it really intrinsic to the story? ---Here: My favourite example of the inanity of these quasi-literary speculations by Ray-\\" `The drop that wrestles in the sea/Forgets her own locality' was from Emily Dickinson, a poet he hadn't read attentively enough, since clearly she had something to say to him.\\".....And, well, what is it?  Never mind, no time for serious pondering.  It's on to more Yeats among others before the paragraph ends (p.351).  - The one exception to all this name dropping is Ray's recital of Matthew Arnold's \\"Dover Beach.\\" to Morel.  But, as is commonplace, the exception proves the rule here. - I could go on about how disappointing the meretricious scholarship is in this work: Is Morel serious about citing Matthew 15:24 as proof that Jesus came only for the Jews?  Is Rush?  Anyone who has read the whole chapter knows that this is where Jesus turns to the Gentiles and heals the Canaanite's daughter because the Jews have rejected him.  Is Rush trying to show that Morel's idealism about a non-Christian Africa is superficial and misplaced?  Or is Rush simply showboating himself---I very much fear that it's the latter.  2 Stars for the few poignant passages on conjugal love.  But, in the end, I would have come away much more enriched had I spent the time reading actual literature: Joyce, Yeats, Wordsworth, Dickinson........Milton.	2004-05-04

This will surprise no reader familiar with Wallace's literary and critical works.  But, unlike his previous works, this one deals with extremely (towards the end) technical mathematics which the author is obliged to gloss over.-Quite a contrast to, say, Infinite Jest.<br />  I was, by turns, frustrated with this lack of rigour, and appreciative of it.  I can't put it better than Wallace does in a footnote on pp.220-221, \\"Rhetoricwise, let's concede one more time that if we were after technical rigor rather than general appreciation, all these sort of connections would be fully traced out/discussed, though of course then this whole booklet would be much longer and harder and the readerly-background-and-patience bar set a great deal higher. So, it's all a continuous series of tradeoffs.\\" - Informed readers take note of his use of the term \\"continuous series\\" here!<br />Thus, Wallace does the best that I think any writer could in walking the tightrope between over-the-top technical mare's nests which only a few members of the faculty at Mathematics departments (and a few autodidacts) could grasp, and what he derides as the \\"Pop\\" accounts of such things as the development of Set Theory.-So, nobody, including Wallace, and myself, is going to be completely satisfied.  While not a complete technical purist, I do wish he'd chosen to be more technical in some parts and less so in others.  As a former student who has always wished his \\"formal\\" training in Mathematics went further that first year college Calculus (though I later worked my way through more advanced textbooks on my own), I was genuinely interested in the technical illuminations this book might provide.  On the other hand, as an appreciator of fine writing, I know the two do not go hand in glove.<br />So, in the end, I should say that this book is as good a \\"tradeoff\\" as you're going to find.  I was pleased to see that Wallace's wit and style haven't suffered from the subject matter.  He rather resembles, in this respect, another writer who is more often quoted herein than any other for, as Wallace terms it alliteratively, his \\"pellucid prose\\": to wit, Bertrand Russell, a mathematician of first order, whose renegade life and pixie wit served him well throughout his (as Wallace puts it, wryly, in the penultimate footnote of the \\"booklet\\") long, distinguished life.

The first one to catch the eye is that the first two essays on the Sonnet repeat each other, word for word, in several places.  But taking the work, which covers many subjects in addition to the \\"Melodies Unheard,\\" which is saved for the last, as a whole, one can not help be struck by Hecht's depth of insight and urbanity of expression on each subject: from Sidney, to Elizabeth Bishop, to Moby Dick.  It is simply impossible for a poetic mind to come away unmoved or without perspective shifted from the depths so adroitly explored here. My favourite example (And I suspect Hecht's as well, since it's the only chapter in the book on which he lavishes a full page reproduction of a Bosch painting in illustration of a part of a poem.  Indeed, there are no other props of this sort in the entire collection.) is his explication of Elizabeth Bishop's poem \\"The Man-Moth.\\"  I never thought very much of Ms. Bishop's poetry before reading this explication, so deep and fecund of insight.  - But herein lies a sort of paradox inherent to most all these essays-I now appreciate \\"The Man-Moth\\" exceedingly but am even more overwhelmed by rereading Hecht's poetic explication of the poem.  The same is true of Hecht on Moby Dick.  I suppose this is a great compliment.  But one wonders whether Ms. Bishop would have thought so.  In any event, though disagreeing with Hecht in regard to a couple of minor nuances here and there, I would say to the already very select group considering the purchase of this book that it's well worth it.  Maybe, if Bishop is a favourite poet of yours or Melville a favourite author, too well worth it.  As Hecht avers in the last essay, \\"...our experience of poetry is no simple business.\\" - Nor is our experience of Hecht.	2003-11-16

He admires several of my favourite, rather obscure authors, such as Lowry and Gaddis, and has written insightful reviews on their lives and work and even introductions to certain masterworks of theirs.  On the other hand, his essays for, say, The New York Review of Books, aren't even essays or reviews in any sort of conventional sense.  Perhaps a new term is needed-Narrative commentaries?  In any event, they always come across as clumsy and inscrutable in a not very endearing sense to me.  This book has confirmed that impression, and I think the entire section on Flaubert a lot of rot.  I understand that in putting the words of \\"The Master\\" in the mind of a fictional character who has memorized all of Flaubert's letters he's attempting to convey the soul or essence of Flaubert in a way in which a straightforward essay would not.  He fails.  It's rubbish.<br />I also throw my hands up regarding his essay on Calvino's Invisible Cities. - Well, that is to say, I know what I think of it.  It's too esoteric by half.  And the game is pretty much up when, at the height of his, er, Calvinolatry, Gass claims that this slim volume out-Proust's Proust.  After such a disproportion, any attempt to take him seriously anent Calvino can be no longer seriously maintained.<br />  But there are some good sections herein, the best being the eponymous essay on why certain works remain resonant with readers throughout the ages.  This is Gass at his best.  This is the Gass who motivated my purchase of this book.  This is the Gass who, unbeknownst to me until I read this essay, holds another of my favourite writers in his pantheon and provides startling insights on why his work passes the tests of time: to wit, Thoreau.<br />So, all in all, a mixed bag.  Unfortunately, the rather tedious parts tend to outnumber the brilliant ones.  And Gass's style, in general, seems to me one that simply wears thin after a couple hundred pages.  When Gass sticks to literature, or to commenting on the writer in the everyday world, through the ages, as he does in \\"The Writer and Politics: A Litany,\\" he is scintillating and exciting.  Most of the writing in this book, though, is of an unpleasantly offbeat nature that tends to the grating or soporific, by turns.  So, three stars for the pearls amidst the paste.ndred pages.

In reading this relatively short work, one gains a sense of what it is like to step into a McCarthy landscape.  For reading his works is more like entering some preternatural world than following your typical plot and glimpsing into depths of an individual character.  Indeed, it is more like walking straight into some sort of warped medieval landscape, as a picture by Bosch or Breughel, than reading a narrative or following a plot line.  One gradually finds one's self engulfed in a visionary realm with tentacles only thinly attached to a \\"realistic\\" one.  And, as indicated by the title, this world is unremittingly bleak.  And this work, like all McCarthy's best, leaves us pondering anew the same question:  Why, for what purpose, is man thrown into this nightmare of a world?  Or, as McCarthy puts it here, \\"He wondered where the blind man was going and did he know how the road ended.  Someone should tell a blind man before setting him out that way.\\"	2003-11-06

This book is genuinely creepy.  Basically, it tells the story of a soul destroyed by a fascination with the doctrine of Predestination-Or, is that all there is to it?-It is a study in the psychology of one Robert Wringhim and the malicious form of insanity that a fervid belief in such a doctrine can inspire in a human heart.-Or is that quite all to be said here?-As a Twenty-First Century reader, one is tempted, if I may use that word anent this book, to see things in this purely \\"psychological\\" light.  And, clearly, this perspective is spot on for the most part.  Robert's world is obviously increasingly inhabited by the projections and personifications of his delusory mind.  But one never quite knows in this book where the boundaries are between what might be called the purely endogenous functions of his mind, and what is, well, real, or if indeed such a distinction is meaningful. -It is well to bear in mind that all this is real to Robert.  How are we to judge?  Should we try?<br /><br />  The only comparable book/story I can think of in English Literature is Henry James's The Turn of The Screw, where James, it seems to me, clearly meant for the psychology of the governess to be the key. While I don't think James believed in ghosts haunting the clich&eacute;d manor, I'm not so sure that Hogg did not believe in the Devil (in some form), embodied in the darkling wastes and dank, baroque towns of a religiously fervid and superstitious Scotland.  To cut to the chase, to call this book MERELY psychological is to miss something here.  It becomes a dismissive term, dismissive of the dark haunts and mysteries of ourselves and of our world that we have not fathomed.  Ideally, this book should give us an eerie pause to stare into those depths without recourse to clinical terms such as \\"psychology\\" and \\"projection\\" and reexamine where certain boundaries lie in the murkiness of our own individual worlds - And, to shudder.	2003-11-05

But, note, this dictum does NOT imply its converse: \\"All sincere poetry is bad.\\" - An important distinction, this. - For Crosby's poetry is nothing if not sincere and, taken out of the context of his life, is bound to seem tawdry, fantastical or sloppy.  In other words, it does indeed seem quite bad.  But taken in the context of this life, it assumes another hue entirely.  As Wolff puts it, his poems were more \\"testaments\\" than poems qua poems.  All his writings on suicide, the worship of the Sun, et al seem pallid and lifeless until one realizes through the reading of this book that he lived these words.  He didn't merely write them.  Upon this realization, (dare I say it) they suddenly BLAZE to life.<br /><br />  The best aspect of the biography for me is that there is no attempt at some sort of psychobabble analysis in the study of a character that surely invites it: Not one \\"Id,\\" \\"Ego,\\" \\"Oedipus Complex,\\" \\"Jungian Archetype,\\" et blah, blah, blah.  Wolff deftly narrates the life-story of this fantastic, wealthy, sybarite with his literary ambition as he lived it through his short, kaleidoscopically decadent and unbalanced life.<br />  But, given all this, there is a prodigal consistency to his life worthy of symbolic logic, right up to the end.  Thus, to me, reading this book was brisk and refreshing (pace to the Puritans).  Near the end of the book, Wolff quotes Mrs. Powell as saying that all Harry's extravagant talk was \\"just literary.\\"  To her, it surely must have been.  But as Wolff points out, \\"For Harry, of course, the locution `just literary' would have been oxymoronic.\\"<br />  In contrast to all the \\"Lost Generation\\" writers and artists and jabberers for whom the whole scene was \\"just literary,\\" to Harry, every word (Indeed, every letter) was wriggling with the blaze of life and........death.<br />  HE MEANT IT.e been oxymoronic.\\"   <br />    In contrast to all the \\"Lost Generation\\" writers and artists and jabberers for whom the whole scene was \\"just literary,\\" to Harry, every word (Indeed, every letter) was wriggling with the blaze of life and........death.<br />   HE MEANT IT.	2003-10-24

I had, in fact, to cudgel my mind in some places to remember the conic section formulae and how number systems without the base of ten worked (especially the binary system). - Those with financial backgrounds will no doubt cudgel their brains over the rise and fall of V.O.C. stock. Those with a philosophical turn of mind will find themselves tackling anew the free will vs. predestination argument and follow it as what we now call science redefines predestination as determinism as well as the old mind-body problem, and others of others persuasions will find much else.<br /><br />  But this is far from a plodding, meandering, didactic book.  Stephenson has written a tale, or several tales loosely and (sometimes) mysteriously interconnected in a style which I can only describe as having a bounce to it.  One feels bounced from one page to another much as the characters and ideas are.  It's not exactly a page-turner in the sense that good mystery genre fiction is, where you turn the pages to find where the next twist will lead all the while making educated guesses at the solution. But one feels rather bounced into the world of (mostly) 17th Century science, philosophy, politics, money, society etc. and finds oneself enwrapped and bouncing along in it, much as the characters do.<br />I hope I shan't have to wait too long from the bounce of the last page of this first book to land me on the first page of the second one!, much as the characters do.<br />I hope I shan't have to wait too long from the bounce of the last page of this first book to land me on the first page of the second one!	2003-10-13

And this collection of poems is his best.  In particular, the eponymous twenty-six page poem that forms the center of the book is the most meditative, sensitive, exquisite poem of our age.  Moreover, it is indispensable for anyone wishing to acquaint himself or herself with Hecht's work, for amidst all the exquisite imagery, contemplations of life and mortality, play of light and dark, is the autobiography of Hecht, rendered as masterfully and wonderfully as anything I've ever read.  Mr. Hecht is erudite in history and literature, and though the knowledge and feel of the woe of mankind is ever present in his works.  He is also aware of those moments of presentiment when its weight is lifted.  Take, for example, these lines from the poem \\"Still Life\\" regarding the moments just before dawn:<br />Why does this so much stir me, like a code<br />  Or muffled intimation<br />Of surprises and preordained events?<br />It knows me, and I recognize its mode<br />Of cautionary, spring-like hesitation,<br />This silence so impacted and intense.<br />As in a water-surface I behold<br />  The first, soft, peach decree<br />Of light, its pale inaudible commands.<br />I stand beneath the pine tree in the cold,<br />Just before dawn, somewhere in Germany,<br />A cold, wet, Gerand rifle in my hands.<br />In two magisterial stanzas, Hecht conveys a wonder and terror through which that he has lived.  With other soi-disant \\"poets\\" literally \\"Howling\\" around him, Hecht maintains, in his quiet, almost whispering, voice an authority and verbal power to convey the beauty and terror of our haunted world.  Everyone entranced with life, mystery and words should own this book.	2003-10-01

It is lively, witty and amusing, as well as strikingly modern in displaying the vicissitudes of fortune in the character Roderick.  These vagaries of fortune, from penury, to wealth, from imprisonment, to landed gent are also reflected in the vagaries in the moods virtues (or lack thereof) in our title character, thus lending Roderick, for most of the book, a three-dimensional aspect and not simply another cardboard cutout for an 18th century picaresque.-But the book does have its faults, particularly as we draw to what we foresee will be the inevitable end.  It's just too pat for many modern readers to swallow.  Or at least it is for this one.  The Oxford edition's notes, while helpful in places, especially with nautical turns of phrase, and for those with a scholarly interest in the location of certain streets in the London in Smollet's day etc tend to become rather annoying at times, almost to the point of insulting the well-read reader's intelligence.  Many times I found myself saying, \\"As if I could not have figured that out on my own from the context!\\"  The book, not surprisingly, is at its best when it is at its most autobiographical and descriptive, particularly the passages of Roderick's first sea voyage.  One of my favourite passages that illustrates the lively vitality and humour of both the character and the work comes when Roderick, feared to be dying of typhoid fever, is visited by a priest to make a last confession:<br />\\"&quot;Without doubt, you have been guilty of numberless transgressions, to which youth is subject, as swearing, drunkenness, whoredom, and adultery; tell me therefore, without reserve, the particulars of each, especially the last, that I may be acquainted with the true state of your conscience....&quot;<br />Roderick, a thoroughgoing, Scottish Ant-Papist will have none of it and soon recovers.<br />I am reminded of Joseph Conrad's short story \\"Youth\\" which I recommend to all who enjoy this book.  -  But, in the end, Conrad's story is the philosophically deeper and more true-to-life narrative than this one.-Again, the ending, for this reader, was just too pat and soppy.  I am not trying to be a \\"spoiler\\" here and ruin the reading of the book and imperiling this review, by telling you potential readers what it is.  You don't need me for that.

Tourists would come to visit and take pictures of them on the weekends.  It was a joy to live and study in these buildings, some of which our founding fathers had visited.  The exception was this ugly, squat building on what we called the \\"Back Campus\\" constructed during the college's postwar expansion.  Everyone agreed it was ugly, which was unusual in a school given to Socratic debate about just about everything.  I remember how my Senior guide cringed when she pointed to it during my visit as a prospective student.  I always wondered how and why such a building that contrasted so dismally with the school's architecture was chosen............Now I know!<br />This book is worthwhile if for no other reason than to give the non-specialist an idea of the history of how such monstrosities came to be deemed worthwhile.	2003-07-29

Eliot's The Wasteland is made aware, is heavily dependent upon other poets and writers for its content and effect.  In short, it's not very original.  Indeed, the last page in the book contains two concluding allusions to a poem by Ezra Pound.  I suppose Ms. Smart either hoped nobody would notice them; or, if they did, to consider her ever so clever for conjoining her work with Mr. Pound's. -Either way, one doesn't get the feel that one is reading anything moving or original here.<br />In lieu of this derivative and misguided work, I would recommend the masterwork of a novella that Ms. Smart is obviously trying to emulate-Nightwood by Djuna Barnes.  This book isn't really a work of art, but as the narrator herself puts is, \\"The noise of my inside seas.\\"----And don't call her Ishmael.	2003-07-28

But these arguments have been put forward previously, much more cogently and thoroughly, most prominently by Harold Bloom in The Visionary Company, among many others. Further, there is a sense of polemic here in fighting a battle that has already been lost now.-She more or less admits this in \\"The Use of the Beautiful\\" where she says, of today's critics and \\"poets\\" that they \\"are genuinely unaware that what they are writing and writing about, is not, properly speaking, poetry at all.\\"<br />  But the book's big drawback, for this reader anyway, is an entrenched English coziness of style which translates into rather bland reading.  She concentrates almost exclusively on English poetry, ignoring almost all American poets and novelists, and English novelists for that matter, which is somewhat odd, given that I was reminded time and time again of William Gaddis's American novel The Recognitions while reading these essays.  I'm glad this little book exists to remind us of what true poetry consists.  But, for this reader, unequipped with an English tea set to read it over, it's just too cozy by half.	2003-07-20

Something my fellow reviewers do NOT seem to have noticed is that this is a work of FICTION. Look for the word on the binding of your copy of the book.  I have no doubt that Eric Blair, who changed his name to George Orwell when he wrote this book in order not to be discovered by his parents and friends, did have some brushes with the sort of life he describes.  But how much of this are we to believe actually happened?<br />The problem with Mr. Blair's work is that it is tendentious.  There are any number of novels out there that include heart-rending accounts of the life of the poor during this era, try Somerset Maugham's Of Human bondage, for instance.  But the polemic chapters at the end on word usage and societal change reveal the raison d'etre for this book.  I wish Mr. Blair could have written a straightforward essay instead of this not very gripping account of slumming it around Dickens' two cities.  In doing so, he exhibits the trait that he censures other writers for so severely in his later years, pretentious rot.	2003-07-09

Which Had No Boundaries in Time and Space, Where Lurked Musical and Strange Names and Mythical and Lost Peoples, and Which Was its	Books	5	22	25	N	N	The quintessentially GOOD American novel	When averring that Raintree County is such a \\"Good\\" book, I find myself searching for words to accurately convey my meaning.  The lyrical gift of Mr. Lockridge is \\"good,\\" though not great as is the case with the brilliant Thomas Wolfe, the American novelist his writing most resembles.  The story, complete with flashbacks, is engaging through all its over 1,000 pages.  The philosophical sections are good as well, and the \\"Perfesser\\" Stiles is one of the most comically and wittily astute Menckenesque characters in all of American fiction.<br />  One thing that I certainly do NOT mean by \\"good\\" is that the book is some sort of sentimental whitewash of American history and archetypal American characters.  They are presented here in all their selfishness, avarice and mean-spiritedness.  Yet, the novel ultimately has such a Whitmanesque all-embracing quality that these human traits dissolve into the rich tapestry of the story, which I found a page-turner despite its length.<br />Ultimately, the novel of which this book most reminds me is not an American, or even English, one at all.  It is Tolstoy's War And Peace.  These books both narrate the human capacity for evil and good, for love and hate, the chaos caused by the greatest war either of the two countries had fought at the time,  the enduring value of friendship, all spread out over a vast panorama of intricate relations.  In short, Raintree County is America's most epic novel: Not the greatest perhaps, but the most epic.<br />But there's something more: At one point in the book (p. 934 in my edition) Shawnessy reflects that, \\"A human life had a dimension that wasn't perfectly understood.\\"  Through reading this book, one somehow comes away with the feeling that one has at least brushed against the boundaries of this mysterious dimension.---No small feat, this.	2003-06-28

Lowry mentions it in one of his last letters as a \\"Secret Missile of the Soul.\\"  I think that's about as far as any reviewer is likely to get in trying to label or summarize this book...<br />Aside from an interest in Flemish masterworks, esoteric sects and religions, forgery, alchemy, the fraudulence and general cheapness of what passes for the artistic endeavour and religious experience in modern society, what this book really requires for enjoyment is a sense of humour. -Lowry also noted how readers failed to grasp the humour of what Gass calls his \\"dark\\" masterpiece-and, of course, an appreciation of fine writing.<br />What else can one say?  Delineate one of the subtle drolleries that are interlaced throughout the book? Plunge into a dissertation upon Mithraism?  Go on about aesthetics and the modern age?-No, you the reader must discover all this for yourself in the hand-grenade-hopscotch that constitutes the reading of this book.  I think any vaster judgments are best left to other (possibly interstellar) forms of life.<br /> I will say, for the record, that the recognition that keeps recurring to me most often comes from the final lines of the cryptic letter to the dentist Dr. Weisgall:<br /><br />\\"Everything grew too fast then, it was no use trying to keep it down.

The book works mainly on two levels: 1.) That of the intrigues, relationships and a certain \\"cabal\\" surrounding the rise of the Fascists and Nazis to power and their eventual defeat, all plausible (I did some research), and historically based, which makes the book the page-turner that it is. 2.) The  embedded questionings of human motivations and actions and meditation-provoking sections futher calling into question what ultimately comprises history.<br />  This second aspect is what makes the book more than just your average historical thriller.  Findley has a fine manner of putting events into a poetic, philosophical cast. - But the book meanders a bit much, and somehow lacks a certain panache and poetic/philosophical heft that detracts from its effectiveness-  Perhaps this is inevitable in a book that weaves in and out of so many different intrigues, betrayals and deceptions while at the same time employing a prose style that is downright contemplative at times.  In other words, the two levels don't quite seem to mesh as they should.<br />Aside from a little muddlednesss, however, this is a very fine piece of literature.  It will having you turning the pages in excited bewilderment while at the same time pondering the questions it provokes about mankind and history.<br />There is an intriguing passage in the middle of Mauberly's narrative where he imagines a future historian, a \\"dread academic, much too careful of his research\\" who will completely botch things in his account of these times \\"because he will not acknowledge that history is made in the electric moment, and its flowering is all in chance....There is more in history of impulse than we dare to know.\\"---So, can a \\"true\\" history be written after all?  Or does a fictional account, such as this book containing a narrative written by a fictional character, have the famous last words?k containing a narrative written by a fictional character, have the famous last words?	2003-05-15

And its theme is increasingly rare in modern literature:  The tragedy and pain of truly falling in love.  Nevertheless, the writing is sophomoric in places: several phrases are lifted directly from the poems of Eliot and Yeats. Moreover, the theme and the writing have Proust written all over them.  At least every other page has whole paragraphs that recall Swann's jealous love for Odettte and Proust's narrator's obsession with Albertine.-The difference is a harsh &quot;realism&quot; in this book absent from Proust.  For Proust, &quot;No woman in the world is worth the truths she reveals to us by causing us to suffer.&quot;  This maxim just doesn't wash with Davies' hero, Charlie Cross.  Or rather, perhaps the truths revealed are just too much for him to take.  In any case, he's certainly an understandable and sympathetically portrayed anti-hero.  His refusal to accept the bromides of modern self-help psychology is especially refreshing. One is reminded of that classic response to, &quot;It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.&quot;---Davies' protagonist practically roars back throughout the book, &quot;Oh yeah, try it some time!&quot;<br />But one feels that there's something missing in this short, tragic novel.  A broader, philosophic sweep perhaps, with less borrowing from other authors.  But, in the end, the author fulfills his pupose of conveying the heartache and longing in love and it's devastating affect upon, as Cross reflects, a certain type of fellow:  &quot;I think there might be quite a few of us out there.

It is an emotionally engrossing tale, especially on Boyle's part, of what physical and emotional/spiritual sacrifices the life of the committed artist demands.-----Yes, there is plenty of name-dropping and stories concerning Pound, Joyce and Hemingway-But that hardly seems the point and neither does their art  (except for Boyle, at times).  This book is about what sort of People they were, how they lived their lives, both internally and externally.<br />The stereotype of the artist as a self-destructive martyr to his or her art is certainly on display here, but the characters aren't represented as hollow stereotypes (which themselves exist, after all, for very good reasons).  They leap from the page as living, breathing people, and one gains an insight into the modus vivendi of each of them.  And it must be said that, of the writers from that milieu that are still remembered today (mentioned above), only Joyce comes through as a lovable figure, and a good man, despite his drinking bouts.<br />The major achievement of this book is that it brings home the humanity of both Boyle and McAlmon as they lived their externally festive (especially McAlmon's), inwardly tormented (especially Boyle's) lives.  There are several other aspects on which one could dwell, Mcalmon's generosity and relative selflessness (as written of by Boyle, not he), Boyle's supposedly more \\"Romantic\\" way of life and art (as written of by McAlmon, not she), but the main effect is that of laying out a physical and psychological tableau of their lives in the 1920's.-As McAlmon confesses, \\"It is a horrible admission, but some of us are driven to work at times to forget about living life.  That creative urge, if you will, or is it that something remembered or contemplated is more entertaining than the actual scene and event being experienced?  Somebody else spoke of Marsden as an 'eagle without a cliff', but aren't we all?\\"-Later he writes, \\"...we had moments of enjoying the sodden destruction of time in a weary world.\\"---<br />As we look back on this supposedly \\"dated\\" attitude of those expatriate writers, can we really say that their actions and outlook were so dated?

Amis may, in fact, be the premier writer of his time for this type of short, spare-not-the rapier witty style of journalistic writing so common in England:  As opposed to America, this collection's ostensible subject, where there is no style, and it is discouraged as bravura.  A brief example of this is Amis's crisp, droll assessment of a particular book:  &quot;The first thing to say about it is that it's bad: It's bad.&quot;  - There are other things to say about it, of course, which Amis duly proceeds to do.  But it's that stylistic, ironic nuance in the opening that captures the flavour of these pieces.  Can anyone imagine an American reviewer or journalist getting away with displaying, heaven forbid, such personal style.<br /><br /> The only fault I find with this book is the one Amis apologizes for in the Introduction, that it is simply a compilation of essays and reviews previously written for English papers.  Thus, what we have here is a collection of snapshots, crystal clear, of certain aspects of America and her writers.  The &quot;big picture,&quot; so to speak, is missing.--But, again, the big picture is not Amis's forte, and you will find yourself delightedly guffawing, in spite of yourself perhaps, at these brilliant flashes of the master of rapier wit.	2003-04-18

Rather, it is comprised of patchwork, non-integrated personal narratives and scanty overviews of psychological theories, literary histories and cultural backgrounds whose lack of integration- Indeed, lack of a coherent thread-do not for a \\"study\\" make.  But the most bothersome aspect about this book, aside from the disjunctive nature of its content, is its detached, arid prose style.  Even the personal accounts of his friendship with Sylvia Plath and his theorizing on the etiology of her suicide (already jejune from the outset, since Plath's is perhaps the most described and theorized over suicide in the last half-century, by friends and otherwise) to his own description of his own failed attempt, there is a listless, plodding quality to the prose, which lends a certain credibility to what Alvarez intimates about this attempt, that it somehow DID kill something inside him.  There is simply a lack of vitality here, which makes for rather humdrum reading, regardless of the weight of the book's subject.  Plath's own autobiographical suicide-oriented novel, The Bell Jar, is a wonderful benchmark of how the subject can be treated with verve and energy.<br />If one is looking for a solid, non-fiction, overview of the subject written with energy, erudition and even whimsy,  Robert Burton's age-old The Anatomy of Melancholy (mentioned glancingly in this book) is still the best and most helpful delving into the subject, both for those simply interested in the phenomenon and, more importantly, from those, like myself, suffering from depression or melancholy and contemplating the possibility of \\"felo-de-se\\".<br />As a reader and a sufferer, I finished this rather bland blook untransformed.  And I truly don't understand how this book of limpid prose and scanty overviews ever made it into publication.----Oh yes, forgot, he was a friend of Ms. Plath!	2003-04-09

McCarthy's Blood Meridian may have a more taut artistic virtuousity to it, but Suttree rings sprawlingly true to life and love while at the same time delivering the poetic lyricism of the arabesques and grotesqueries of life that stamp McCarthy as the greatest and most visionary writer of our time.  Here is the pathos, bitterweetness, and  comedy  (Can anyone forget Harrogate and the bats, much less his getting off the charge of bestiality because &quot;A mellon ain't no beast&quot;?!?) of being human.-All this delivered in the most magnificent sweeping prose since Lowry  (A writer I'd recommend to McCarthy fans) and Faulkner.<br />  But down to some philosophical nuts and bolts:  This is a dark novel displaying a visionary medieval mindset, much like Lowry's Under The Volcano (To my mind, the only other novelist  of pure genius of this century..).  It is the seemingly effortless interweaving of the visionary with the mundane that make this novel so astounding.  We are witnesses to page upon page of brilliant poetic lightenings upon a tableau of &quot;a terrestrial hell&quot; as Suttree puts it, a place which not only he, but we all inhabit.<br />To quote at length: &quot;What deity in the realms of dementia, what rabid god decocted out of the smoking lobes of hydrophobia could have devised a keeping place for souls so poor as this flesh.  This mawky wormbent tabernacle.&quot;<br /><br />This is the question this brilliant work thrusts before the reader in page upon glowing page.	2003-04-02

It doesn't rise to the realm of high art, although the writing is splendid in parts.  The philosophy displayed through most of the novel comes across as sophomoric and meretricious. As autobiography it is dubious at best, as anyone who has read a biography of London knows.  On all these accunts, London's other semi-autobiographical work, John Barleycorn, is much better and well-grounded......And yet, any one who has ever been in love or thirsted for beauty and knowledge, or has had ambition thwarted, or had it fulfilled and found that its reward led to emptiness can not help saying that this is the stuff of life.<br /><br />The book has Nietzsche's influence written all over it.  Indeed, the closing lines of Chapter XXVIII are directly lifted from Nietzsche.  This influence doesn't, to my mind, detract from the novel though.  Quite to the contrary, it's what holds the book thematically and artistically together.<br />The best part of the book by far is the ending, wherein London remains artistically and thematically true to himself and to his readers, and thereby renders the book unpalatable for mass consumption.  As Nietzsche puts it, &quot;I love him who is abashed when the dice fall to make his fortune, and asks, 'Am I then a crooked gambler?' For he wants to perish&quot;  There is also the influence and theme of that most anomolous of the books of The Bible, Ecclesiastes, which is, again, more overtly evident in London's John Barleycorn: &quot;Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.  What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?&quot;<br />This book has its faults, but indiffence to the very pulse of life and to the vagaries of the human condition is not one of them.  I can't imagine any lover of and struggler with words and life coming away from Martin Eden unmoved.	2003-03-29

This said, the book hardly seems one to be recommended by AA or the temperance movement.  Although, as pointed out by another reviewer, the author equivocates in usually one or two line disclaimers after long passages in which he narrates an alcoholic episode, the overall effect almost amounts to an apotheosis of alcohol and its effects.  Indeed, it is personified in the book by what London calls &quot;The White logic,&quot; and the most moving, lyrical and philosophical passages are given to this &quot;character&quot; in the book.<br />Consider the following quotes about &quot;him&quot; and his effects:<br />&quot;He is the august companion with whom one walks with the gods.&quot;<br />&quot;And every thought was a vision, bright-imaged, sharp-cut, unmistakable.  My brain was illuminated by the clear, white light of alcohol.&quot;<br />Most importantly consider what &quot;he&quot; says:<br />&quot;Let the doctors of all schools condemn me....What of it?  I am truth.  You know it....Life lies in order to live.  Life is a perpetual lie-telling process.  Life is a mad dance in the domain of flux, wherein appearances in mighty tides ebb and flow...You are such an appearance, composed of countless appearances out of the past. All an appearance can know is mirage.&quot;<br />I don't think so great a poet as Shelley could have put this ghastly vision of life more powerfully in prose form, though he does in verse, in his last, ironically titled poem, The Triumph Of Life.<br />I don't know whom London thought he might be fooling here with his mild calls for Prohibition pitted against the Romance and lyricism he associates with his drinking episodes and, above all, the profoundly counterbalancing effect of &quot;the White Logic.&quot;  The book is ultimately an autobiography of this voice within him.an autobiography of this voice within him.	2003-03-26

To begin, with the exception of the eponymous story at the beginning , these stories are the stylstic masterpieces of a miniaturist virtuoso.  These renarrated fairy tales are nuanced stories that give the reader pause to reconsider his or her sexuality and the inherent violence and danger attendant upon it.-And then, perhaps, to reflect that the fairy stories in their original form were less explicit forms of the same thing for children....As the writer Djuna Barnes puts it in Nightwood, \\"God, children know something they can't tell; they like Red Riding Hood and the wolf in bed!\\"<br />  The first story, is, to my taste, the only failure here.  It's a bit too heavy-handed and obvious, and the imagery and phraseology borrow too much from Poe, particularly from his \\"The Fall of The House of Usher.\\"  They leave you straining for an impact which is just not there.  That said, the rest of the stories are erotic/metaphysical gems in which the reader can peer into his or her own sexuality in its many (mostly crimsoned) facets.<br />  There is a subtle but deep undertone here that, in some way, our sexuality makes us all otherworldy ghouls and outcasts from the civilized world.  As the narrator puts it in \\"The Lady of the House of Love,\\" \\"The end of exile is the end of being.\\"-In other words, our sexuality  metamorphoses (one of Carter's favourite words and themes)us into vampires, werewolves and sadistic murderers, if only in our imagination, and frequently in life.<br />  An exqusite book to pique anyone's interest into his or her sexuality and its implications, both in the realms of action and imagination	2003-03-24

And yes, the influences of Faulkner and Malcolm Lowry are evident: Both stylistically and thematically.  But really, the impression left upon one, as noted by Alan Cheuse of the USA Today, is ultimately a visual one, rendered in passages of puisssant descriptive lyricism, reminiscent of the medieval paintings of Hieronymous Bosch.  Anyone who has spent any deal of time absorbing these paintings and their twisted, dark visions of various forms of baroque grotesqueries and human depradations cannot help but feel a similar chord being struck in the reading of this work.  The question the wonder at both these works poses to anyone drawn into deep contemplation of them is:  What sort of world is this?<br /> Indeed, is this the \\"real\\" West of the time, despite its being loosely based on historical fact?-One wonders-The point is that this is not exactly \\"realistic\\" fiction.  Rather, it is quite the opposite.  In its essence, it is a visionary novel.  -- Does anyone believe that a character such as The Judge, in all his omniscience and archetypal dancing immortality ever existed as described here? - No, this book, again presents us with with a certain VISION of the world, and that vision, as in Bosch, is irremediably bleak.<br />As the \\"expriest\\" says, \\"But someplace in the scheme of things this world must touch the other.\\"-This book, I would posit, is a verbal landscape of that place.  Can we give this place a name?: With a nod to Dante, other reviewers have compared it to both The Inferno and The Purgatorio.- But as The Judge puts it, \\"The truth about the world...is that anything is possible.  Had you not seen it all from birth and thereby bled it of its strangeness it would appear to you for what it is...a fevered dream, a trance bepopulate with chimeras having neither analogue or precedent....whose ultimate destination after many a pitch in many a mudded field is unspeakable and calamitous beyond reckoning....\\"  This is the world of \\"Tomorrow and tomorrow....\\" in Macbeth.  It is the ghoulish \\"walking dream\\" beyond hope.  It is, in short, the world of the Gnostics, created by an evil demiurge when God wasn't watching, so to speak.<br />This is what makes Blood Meridian a masterpiece.

I have no inkling as to why only Volume II is included here.  It may be simply a slip on Amazon's part (I didn't realize myself that there were two volumes amounting to almost 2,000 pages until I ordered it) or that the first volume is listed as out of print.  But this review applies to both volumes which, by the bye, may be ordered as one, if not from Amazon,  from Edward R Hamilton booksellers.<br />  It is difficult to put into words the boundless joy that accompanies the reading of these letters.  Here is Lowry at his most winkingly self-deprecatory, literarily allusive and, above all, charming and downright funny.  For anyone who values the English Language and English literature highly; as, in fact, necessary to life, as Lowry did, these letters will hold you spellbound.  Here is indeed the record of a man who, quite literally, lived and died for language and literature.  As his most famous letter here, the one to his publisher which ultimately led to the publication of Under The Volcano, has it, \\"...but just the same in our Elizbethan days we used to have at least passionate poetic writing about things that will always mean something and not just silly ... style and semicolon technique: and in this sense I am trying to remedy a deficiency, to strike a blow, to fire a shot for you as it were, roughly in the direction, say, of another Renaissance: it will probably go straight through my brain but that is another matter.\\"<br />  It is clear from almost every letter here, that Lowry was trying his damnedest,in all his writings, to live up to this manifesto; that, despite the continual tragedies of his life,  he was always picking himself up and wringing from his life \\"passionate poetic writing\\", which, it is clear from these letters, was, to a great extent, lived as a literary endeavour.<br /><br />  That the shot did eventually go through his brain, so to speak, was not entirely unexpected by Lowry or anyone who knew him. -  But neither was Sir Walter Ralegh's unjust execution. - Ultimately then, these collected letters live up to the title: Sursum Corda!-Lift up your hearts!-Here is page upon page of writing about things that will always mean something: Love of life, literature, words and a delight in language in and of itself.-<br />Unrealistic though my expectaation of their reading of these two massive tomes may be, I would recommend them to anyone who suffers from the peculiar fate of being human.ally go through his brain, so to speak, was not entirely unexpected by Lowry or anyone who knew him. -  But neither was Sir Walter Ralegh's unjust execution. - Ultimately then, these collected letters live up to the title: Sursum Corda!-Lift up your hearts!-Here is page upon page of writing about things that will always mean something: Love of life, literature, words and a delight in language in and of itself.-<br />Unrealistic though my expectaation of their reading of these two massive tomes may be, I would recommend them to anyone who suffers from the peculiar fate of being human.	2003-03-17

This book is definitely NOT for those interested in a thorough, searching delve into Byron and his poetry.  But, moreover, it is not even the &quot;page-turner&quot; which other reviewers make it out to be.<br />The book is written in this precious, cozy, semi-academese which drains the blood from the writing.  There is no evaluation of the poet in the context in the particular developmental stage of English poetry at the time.  And Shelley, in particular, gets a particularly curt dismissal.---But the real problem with this biography is not that Eisler is dismissive of other (in Shelley's case, better) poets or that her book is simply a rehashing of previously known circumstances.  The problem is her plodding, lifeless, cutesy writing style.  By the end of the book, one feels that Ms. Eisler has appropriated Byron into her cozy world of popularized, made-for-giant-publishing-houses beach-read bios.  Has anyone else noticed that all the chapters are almost the exact number of pages in length? Such precise compartmentalization does not for the reflection of a life make, in particular Byron's!<br />The one merit this book indisbutably does have is to make you want to read or reread Byron's poetry.  Eisler's citations of neatly culled snippets are the only lively thing in the book!  So, after you've read all about the minutiae of the poet's life and feel drained and off-put at the end:<br />Close thy Eisler!  Open thy Byron!	2003-02-22

The irony is that Johnson, while judgmental, was at least interesting in his thundering declarations.<br />I cannot for the life of me understand why all the other reviewers find this work daring or controversial.  Schmidt says nothing new.  He is, in fact, the most diplomatic of judges.  And I challenge any reader to find an unequivocal take on any of the poets.  He inevitably has both good and bad things to say.<br />A further irony is that the title of the book is a misnomer.  Yes, Schmidt provides a few scanty biographic facts, but a better title might be The History of Metrics or something of the sort.  The book is mostly concerned with the form English poetry has taken over the past several hundred years.<br />Above all, Schmidt hates exegetics.  Don't expect in depth explorations of a poem's meaning or the evaluation of poet's oevre.  Truly, this book reads like a hopscotch through the history of meter and rhyme.  No wonder it only took him ten months to write the 900 or so pages.  He didn't have to think!	2003-01-14

First Off: There's no way I'm going to cram into a thousand words everything I feel I need to say about this book.  Thus, I'll stick to what I regard as the bare bones of its import.  The first thing you have to realize is just how much Paglia owes to her mentor, Harold Bloom.  I would strongly advise any potential readers of this book to read both The Visionary Company and The Western Canon before embarking into this scintillating morass, however unrealistic an expectation that may be.<br />  This book, despite all the lip service given to the \\"Appolonian,\\" is deluged with the Chthonian, and the reader will come away from this tome besplattered with the mud and slime of the swampy Chtonian Nature of the world than anything else.  Mind you, there's nothing contradictory in this result.  It is indeed just what the much-praised Appolinian artist does, according to Paglia: Reveal the Chthonian with a voyeuristic, Spencerian eye.  This Paglia does with an elan and flair unmatched in critical writing.<br />But beware!  Paglia, like Bloom, is reductionist.  Bloom's ultimate take on more or less the same subject matter with which Paglia treats is Gnosticism, thus ultimately spiritual.  Bloom sees a sort of warfare going on between the earthly and chthonian and the spiritual.  He resolves this in Gnosticism, an heretical sect that flourished in the early centuries A.D. and maintained that this world is evil, created by a \\"demiurge\\" and that the visions of poets like Shelley are nothing less than emanations from another realm.  For Paglia, all this is sexual, and Bloom would not deny a sexual element in all of it, but he goes a bit further in explaining it.  Prime example:  Paglia's \\"womb/tomb\\" of the Chthonian is simply a given.  In Bloom, it is the prison of our Fall fom the Gnostic other realm.  It fits into a cosmology.<br />  There's a very weird realization that comes over the reader (at least this reader) when we come to the Coleridge section on his poem \\"Christabel\\" and the vampire Geraldine and continues creeping over him or her until the final chapter on Emily Dickinson.  I know no other way of saying this than that Paglia BECOMES Geraldine to the reader. - I agree with her that Emily Dickinson is an extremely powerful and misunderstood poet and, indeed, have spent several ultimately worthwhile hours poring over her short poems to discover the sexual/spiritual depths.  But, sorry Camille, Dickinson is just not another Sade altogether.  But in the way Paglia presents her, with Sadean snippets of her poetry, the reader who is unfamiliar with the rest of Dickinson's work cannot fail to come away with this conviction. - For the record: I think part of Dickinson's persona is sadomachistic, but it is only a piece of a complex puzzle.<br />What we are witnessing and in danger of becoming engulfed in (It happened to me.) is Paglia' own mythopoecism.  At some point between Christabel and Dickinson, Paglia becomes the subject of her work.  We fall in love with her (I did.); but in the way that Christabel does with Geraldine. She lures us into her own imaginative fixation on the Chthonian womb/tomb of the female, and we identify HER with IT.<br />In conclusion, READ THIS BOOK, if only for the transformative effect it will have on you.

But it is an imagery of the heart as well as the place.  I DO wish the young Capote had threshed out this book into the Bildungsroman it was so clearly intended to be.  But, for whatever reason, he stops short, leaving the reader with a deep impression of his vivid imagery and lyricism. But, when it comes down to it, not much else.  Still for a 17 year old, this is quite a feat.-One need only compare how Capote handles the character of Idabel who was based on the same girl on whom Harper Lee based her character Scout in To Kill A Mockingbird (They grew up in the same town.) to see how much purer and deeper a seer and artist Capote is than Ms. Lee could ever hope to be.-So, to sum things up, an exquisite read, but one wishes that Capote's Joel could have developed and discovered more about himself and the world at the point where the book, rather coyly, ends.	2002-10-04

For the Sapphophile, there are certainly more exhaustive and interesting books, some are which are noted in the bibliography at the end. Furthermore, for all the treacly editorial reviews about Ms. Reynolds's scholarly resources (which are certainly evident), she abuses them time and time again in two ways, one merely bothersome, and the other approaching dishonesty. 1.)She frequently truncates the passages from other authors just when they begin to get interesting. 2) She frequently selects works of literature, particularly poems, that may or may not have anything to do with Sappho and offers no solid evidence that they do.  They are, I guess, Sapphic by association.  Reynolds's association.  The two most obvious examples are Shelley's &quot;To Constantia, Singing&quot; and Emily Dicknson's &quot;&quot;Heaven&quot;- Is What I Cannot Reach!&quot;  To take the latter as a case in point, the poem is supposed to be Sapphic because of a three line Sappho fragment (#105) about an apple on the topmost bough.  Need I remind everyone that there was another apple on a bough in another book that has a far more rich cultural history.  And given that Dickinson's poem concerns &quot;Heaven&quot; and &quot;Paradise,&quot; it seems a stretch, so to speak, to see the poem as influenced by the Sapphic fragment.  Truth be known, I spent many more hours meditating on Ms. Dickinson's exquisite 15 line poem than I did in reading the rest of the entire hodgepodge of this book, though I plodded through from srart to finish.<br />  So, my advice is to buy a book of Ms. Dickinson's poems or a more intriguing and honest study of Sappho.  This book is just a non-starter.	2002-10-01

This one did it for me.  I rank it with Graham Swift's Waterland as being the best post WWII novel I've yet discovered (I don't consider Malcolm Lowry's Under The Volcano a postwar novel since he wrote it before and during the war, and it has a prewar setting.)<br />  I don't think going into the plot will be of much service here. Suffice it to say that it is about a young Englishman finding himself caught up in a whirlwind of ever greater questionings of what is &quot;real&quot; in himself and others in a way that is, at times, truly gut-wrenching.  Also, it helps if you at least remember the basic plot to Shakespeare's The Tempest.  A smattering of Latin, Greek (ancient and modern), French and a general knowledge of English literature won't hurt either.  But these are not absolutes in falling under the novel's spell, they simply enhance one's appreciation of the texture and lyricism of the writing.<br />  As other reviewers have pointed out, those seeking the formulaic denouement, in which all is made clear, are missing the point, such as it is.  As well as being an imaginary challenge, the book tugs at the heartstrings until they nearly snap, then leaves the reader flat on his or her back, haunted and wondering and questioning his or her self and all relations to others, past and present.  There IS a sort of answer in the form of a question posed by &quot;the magus,&quot; Conchis, early in the book:  &quot;Are you drinking the water or the wave?&quot;  I could try to deconstruct this, but it would be a spoiler.  Just remember the numinous experiences Nicholas has when hypnotized, when with Alison in Greece and in the FINAL SCENE.  After which (hint!), one might like to reread Keats's &quot;Ode on a Grecian Urn.&quot;<br />  Finally, for those other reviewers (I read all 139 of them) who found the book life changing or the best thing they have ever read, I recommend (mind you, only for those seriously affected by the work), not some other modern novel, but Proust's 3,000 page Rememberance of Things Past, where they will find an even deeper and more profound exploration of the questions to which this book gives rise.<br />  To quote the late poet James Dickey, &quot;We're all out in the storm: You, me, everybody.&quot;ose other reviewers (I read all 139 of them) who found the book life changing or the best thing they have ever read, I recommend (mind you, only for those seriously affected by the work), not some other modern novel, but Proust's 3,000 page Rememberance of Things Past, where they will find an even deeper and more profound exploration of the questions to which this book gives rise.  <BR>  To quote the late poet James Dickey, &quot;We're all out in the storm: You, me, everybody.&quot;	2002-09-29

Nevertheless, fans of the \\"Gothic\\" will not be disappointed.<br />  But there is a just a bit more here than a romp through the glorious medieval dark.  The author has a keen insight into human dissimulation, inconstancy and hypocricy.  None of the characters turns out to be quite what he or she seems at first glance. - From the opening scene in which the townfolk of Madrid are coming to hear Ambrosio's sermon \\"...all of them foreign to the ostensible motive.  The Women came to show themselves, the Men to see the Women.\\" etc., etc (a situational irony that will not be lost on anyone who has spent many a Sunday morning sitting in a pew) to Antonia's mother bowdlerizing her daughter's copy of the Bible because of the many prurient and horrifc scenes depicted in THAT book, The Monk is filled with such authorial apercus regarding the foibles of human nature that cannot fail to leave the reader almost unconsciously chuckling to his or her self.<br />  Finally, the monk himself is not an entirely unsympathetic character (despite his many crimes, including murder and premeditated rape).  The author takes some pains to depict him as a victim of circumstance who should never have been left in swaddling clothes at the abbey gate in the first place.<br />  But, these points aside, following the story through its meandering plot twists, poetic interludes and phantasmagoria is just a plain good rollick.<br /><br />  So, forget the lit/crit. Enter the labyrinth!	2002-09-22

This is a mesmeric, haunting novel, and for those of you who are fooled into thinking this is primarily about mental illness...Think and READ again.  You have fallen into a sort of trap set by this extremely subtle, almost wily, author.  Yes, mental illness is one thematic level on which one can read this, in so many ways, disturbing and original book.-\\"And when the ink begins to write/ It makes the paper black and white.\\"-The poem from Benedick's visionary mother pops up at beginning and end of the narrative.

To come to the conclusion that all she and Benedick need or needed is/was some psychotropic drug like Lithium is to say the same of, say, Shelley or Van Gogh.  If you think the ending, at first glance, is simplistic, you're right.  But if you think that it undermines the the otherwise terror and fairy tale ridden narrative, then you're reading it on the level which most adults read fairy tales: That is, you're not reading it.  <BR>   <BR>   For the ending is the most terrifying part of the book: a fairy tale full of fairy tales that tell us more about ourselves than we like to think.

My problem with this book is one that has been stated by a couple other reviewers:  Is it reliable as a source of what actually went through the people's minds and hearts during the era and in the locale in question as its author and its proselytes proclaim it to be? - My answer is, in a word, &quot;No.&quot;  No book can accomplish this feat.  But that doesn't mean that attempts such as this one can't be &quot;beautiful as shipwrecks from paradise,&quot; to borrow from Shelley.<br />   To cut to the chase, what the book succeeds in doing is not in demarking the Middle Ages from the Renaissance, but in contrasting the Middle Ages (as Huizinga would like to see them anyway) with Huizinga's own age.  I'm not going to belabor the point, just one citation will suffice: On page 235,Huizinga asseverates, &quot;There was no great truth of which the medieval mind was more certain than those words from the Corinthians, 'For now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face.'  They never forgot that everything would be absurd if it exhausted its meaning in its immediate function and form of manifestation, and that all things extend in an important way to the world beyond.&quot;  Really now?  How does he know this?  Has he conducted extensive interviews with the illiterate serfs whose lifetimes were a fraction of ours and who spent their waking hours trying to keep food in their bellies?  What Huizinga is describing here is a mystical perception of the world prevalent among poets and mystically inclined philosophers throughout all ages and lands.  Huizinga's own citation of Corinthians undermines the notion that this view was exclusive to the Middle Ages....But it's a beautiful picture nonetheless, though it be untrue to the reality.<br />In conclusion, Huizinga is a poetic, artistic historian, and the insights in this book are such as one would expect given this approach: Fascinating, richly textured, but, well, not verifiable or entirely true in many cases.  Enjoy.  But you may want to hang your critic's hat on a medieval peg somewhere.  Surely you have one.	2002-07-03

My problem with this book is the same that has been expressed by a couple other reviewers: to wit, does Huizinga really know what was going through the hearts and minds of the people in the particular era and region with which the book deals, as the author and his proselytes claim?  My answer is, in a word,-No.  No book can.  History is an elusive subject under the best of circumstances.<br />Let me cut to the chase.  Huizinga is really not so much interested in demarking the Middle Ages from the Renaissance.  After one gets into the thick of things, it becomes quite obvious that what he's actually about is contrasting the Middle Ages (as he understands or imagines them) from his own historical milieu.  I won't belabor the point: one citation will suffice.  On page 235, Huizinga asseverates that, &quot;There was no great truth of which the medieval mind was more certain than those words from the Corinthians, 'For now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face.'  They never forgot that everything would be absurd if it exhausted its meaning in its immediate function and form of manifestation, and that all things extend in an mportant way to the world beyond.&quot;  How does he know?  Did he conduct extensive interviews with illiterate serfs whose life expectancy was a fraction of ours and spent almost all their waking hours trying to put food in their bellies? - No, the worldview Huizinga describes above is one common to mystics and poets of all eras and climes.  His very citation of the Corinthians subverts any notion that it was exclusive to the Netherlands in the Middle Ages.<br />Huizinga was essentially an artistic and poetic writer, and the insights one comes away with from his book are such as one might expect from one so gifted: textured and fascinating portraits of a time now lost.  But they are just that, verbal pictures, calling to mind not so much Breughel or any of the other artists whose works are Plated in the middle of the book, but that of the Pre-Raphaelites.<br />This is an enchanting book and well worth the read.  It's just that you may have to hang your critic's hat upon a medieval peg before sitting down to enjoy it.  I trust you have one...a medieval peg that is.he Pre-Raphaelites.<br />This is an enchanting book and well worth the read.

Romanticism does NOT break out in this book.  The very fact that it can be characterized as such shows us just how far we've come from the Romantic era.-All that &quot;breaks out&quot; in this novel is meticulous descriptive writing of the late 18th Century German milieu, in all its mundanities and shoddiness.  In other words, the book is ANTI-ROMANTIC.  The only Romantic passages are the quotes from Fitzgerald's straw man/main character Novalis and they are always quoted in a context that makes them appear misguided and silly.  I'm sure Fitzgerald could have done the same thing with Keats, who grew up as a stable boy.  Romantics are easy to comedize, because they take everything seriously.  In doing so, they express our greatest longings and highest aspirations as well as the depths of human despair.<br />I'm too depressed by this book and by the reviewers and critics who have fooled themselves into thinking something deeper is going on here to say anymore.  But I'll end with a riposte quoted from Novalis on p.157 (and, of course, made by Fitzgerald to look ridiculous in the context in which she places it): &quot;Courage is more than endurance, it is the power to create your own life in the face of all that man or God can inflict, so that every day and every night is what you imagine it.  Courage makes us dreamers, courage makes us poets.&quot;<br />  Have the courage not to go along with the fickle sheep of reviewers and critics on this one.  Have the courage to see the book for what it is:  An old, learned woman's meticulous sneer at the visions that make living on this earth worthwhile.	2002-02-25

Each short chapter is headed up by one of the character's names (e.g., Vardamen), and the lyrical interior monologue prose for which Faulkner is famous is written in a working class dialect not so easy to decipher sometimes even for a reader raised in South Carolina! - Sound familiar?...<br />I think this book was awarded the Booker Prize as sort of an apology for not giving it to Swift's Waterland...<br />  Nevertheless, the book is good.  I guess if you go along with the famous Picasso quote that, \\"Mediocre artists plagiarize.  Great artists steal.\\" then I guess none of the above will bother you.  Despite the superficial overtones of mortality and death, the theme is really that recurring Proustian one in Swift's work: The elusiveness of Reality.  As Vic meditates (p.216), \\"You see all the dead, all the bent or broken or plain stretched-out dead, and you think, These people are strangers now, total strangers.  But it's the living who are strangers, it's the living whose shapes you can't ever guess.\\"<br />Pretty good stuff.  I mean, you could do a lot worse than this book, a whole lot worse...	2002-02-19

It is a very profound book well worth 5 stars but, come now, it's not Tolstoy or Proust or Faulkner.  I'm afraid that, along with the themes and images of decay IN this work, we must also come to grasp with the decay OF literature in general and interest therein.  To do otherwise seems to be grasping at straws.<br />  Decay permeates every pore of this book.  The eccentric 17th century surgeon Thomas Browne who makes recurrent appearances throughout is cited early on (p.24), &quot;To him it seems a miracle that we should last a single day.&quot;  That pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the reading.  It is even carried further in a citation from Browne on page 154 &quot;...The advocates of a fourth philosophy maintain that time has run its course and that this life is no more than a fading reflection of an event beyond recall.&quot;  It seems that even a single day of Reality is denied us.<br />  One actually internalizes this haunting sense from reading the narrator's account of his cavortings across the East coast of England and the various memories and historical tangents they arouse in him.  What is this elusive thing called called Time we all exist in?  In what sense is it in any way real? - The author compels us to ask these questions to ourselves again and again as memories and history interweave mysteriously with the present during his perignations and encounters with various and sundry sorts.<br />  And yet, for all this decay and unreality, the book is far from an unpleasant read.  Quite the opposite.  Following it, one becomes lost in a dreamy world of flickering lights and shadows, enrapt in a somehow enchanting melancholy reverie.<br />  As Mrs. Ashbury says of herself and her family(p.220), &quot;All of us are fantasists, ill-equipped for life...&quot;  The same might be said of all us readers, and humans.	2002-02-06

I guess by accepting one of the underlying themes of the novel: that the world we live and love in is a mysterious place and that for all the verbal magic of which we humans are capable (as evinced in this novel!) we fall short of being able to pin down Reality.  As Randolph Ash, one of the two Victorian era characters puts it on page 306, &quot;He thought of his hopes and expectations and the absence of language for most of them.&quot;<br />  What I find more than a tad disconcerting about almost all the other reviews (with a few greatly appreciated exceptions!) is that the readers want plot, characters, and page-turning reading.-That is, they want diversion and entertainment-Thus they are none-too-suprisingly less than filled with rapture over a book whose fundamental theme, it seems to me, is the nature of the love and language that makes us conscious, sentient human beings.<br />  Yes, there is a plot.  But the 20th century characters seem so thin, two-dimensional and untextured in comparison to the Nineteenth century artists on whom they are fixated that this hardly seems to be what this book is all about.  What it IS about is the love between Ash and LaMotte and the nature of love in general.  The tenuity of the 20th century characters and their relationships seems to be purposeful in order to contrast them with their Nineteenth Century subjects.<br />  &quot;...the life of the past persisting in us, is the business of every thinking man and woman.&quot;  This is a quote by Ash, in the Nineteenth Century.  The only two twentieth century characters who truly make internalizing the past their business are obviously Roland and Maud.<br />  OK. I won't go on to a long dissertation.  But I will say that I was amazed that none of the editorial or customer reviews (I read ALL of them) so much as mentioned Proust, the themes of whose work this work most closely parallels.  And I will also say to those few reviewers who seemed to appreciate the deeper implications of this novel, to give Proust a gander.  I will also state that for me that the gauntlet the book throws down for the reader is proffered by Ash on p.185 &quot;-the only life I am sure of is the life of the imagination.&quot;<br />  But you have to have been enchanted by the magical realm the characters have let flow from their souls into their poetry and letters, filling half or more of the book (which so many of the reviewers admit to have skipped) to appreciate the mystery with which Byatt confronts us:  What, after all, is REAL?  Is the brief physical relationship between Ash and LaMotte more REAL than their poetry and visionary experiences which fill these pages?<br />  It seems to me you have to have at least asked yourself these questions to understand the choice Roland makes at the end.<br />  To conclude, this book is for those who are truly Romantic and possess a sense of wonder at themselves and the constantly changing universe they inhabit and who ask themselves from time to time &quot;Who am I?&quot; &quot;Where am I?&quot; &quot;What is Love?&quot;  To those readers who have that sense of wonder and in whom this novel struck a resounding chord, I recommend Proust as a follow-up.

That is, it so obviously serves as a mere vehicle for Sartre to get his &quot;existentialist&quot; (or whatever you may call them) ideas across.  The characters are (purposefully, of course) insipid and full of a malaise that makes for plodding reading except for Sartre's most devoted recruits (and there are quite a few of them to judge from the reviews).<br />  All that really happens, so to speak, is that the book's protagonist, Mathieu, wanders around with acquaintances of various sorts (one can hardly call them friends or lovers, in any substantial sense of those terms) wondering what to do about the pregnancy of his mistress and how to finance her abortion.<br />  &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; ostensibly, as referred to in the book, indicates Mathieu's own age, 34, at which one is supposed to shift from a restless, Bohemian existence and settle down to responsibility.  On the deeper, more ironic level, it is a prolonged sneer that the so called Age of Reason (whose French exemplars include Descartes and Voltaire among others) is now debunked and effete, and that we now know that (as shown by the characters in the novel) there is no real rhyme or reason behind men's actions.  Man is not, &quot;the rational animal&quot; as Aristotle would have it, and the onset of WWII is there to prove it.<br />  As Mathieu puts it, &quot;Perhaps it's inevitable; perhaps one has to choose between being nothing at all and impersonating what one is.  That would be terrible,&quot; he said to himself; &quot;it would mean that we were naturally bogus.&quot;<br />  The thing is that there's nothing particularly new or original even in the philosophy as spelled out above.  Shakespeare said the same thing hundreds of years ago, &quot;All the World's a stage, and we are merely players.&quot;<br />  Simply put, I can't stand this sort of rot.  Even the enthusiasts of Existentialism and the &quot;condemned to be free&quot; mantra have a hard time making sense of it and are still pathetically quibbling over what these terms mean.<br />  Look, if you want to read great French literature, read Proust.  If you want to see the barren meaninglessness of life displayed in remoreseless detail, read just about anything by Paul Bowles.<br />  This book, as the main character says of himself, is a washout.

US	49315939	RLSLCHAOO303Y	0846205262	936370098	Edgar Allan Poe: A Study in Genius	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Mind of Morbid Beauty	This biography essentially takes the (to my mind) correct and psychological tack to validating Poe's genius, though it be of a very peculiar sort.  The problem (as any lost soul who chances upon this esoteric review of an out-of-print biography has probably guessed) is that the psychology of the time (1926) was inundated by Freudianism.  Thus, we have the word &quot;neurotic&quot; and &quot;neurosis&quot; springing up time and time again when it is not at all clear that this verbal crutch serves as more of a hindrance than a help to understanding Poe.  But perhaps this is just a semantic quibble.  For, whatever you may call it, there was something truly out of the ordinary in Poe's psychological makeup and this, Krutch contends, is what makes for the genius of his works: They were born of the living realities that tormented his own mind, not concocted artifice.<br />  I think Poe's quote on pages 127-128 serve best to illustrate this point, &quot;-whether all that is profound-does not spring from disease of thought-from moods of mind exalted at the expense of general intellect.  They who dream by day are cognizant of many things who dream only by night.  In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awaking, to find that they have been upon the verge of a great secret.  In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is good, and more of the mere knowledge of which is evil.  They penetrate, however rudderless or compassless, into the vast ocean of the &quot;light ineffable.&quot;-To anyone associated with Romantic poetry or mystic religious literature, the adjective that springs to one's mind here is not &quot;neurotic&quot; but rather mystical and/or Romantic.<br />  Poe like all the great mystics and Romantics (St. John of The Cross, Shelley, Yeats etc.) actually lived his particular credo: in his case that the most poetical topic in the world is the death of a beautiful woman.  From &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; to (my favorite) &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; there is that consecrated worship of the waiflike unworldy female by the poet or his alter ego.  The thing is, Poe actually LIVED this life, as any writer worth reading does in re his works.  He died a virgin, and married a thirteen year old whose strange beauty made the act of sex unthinkable and evil.  In short, Poe inhabited his own unique world which his works were mere manifestations thereof.  This, I agree with Krutch, qualifies him to the title of genius.<br />  Where I diverge with Krutch is in his failure to see where Poe fits into any kind of tradition, save in isolated cases such as the chord Poe struck in Baudelaire.  The tradition of &quot;morbid purity&quot;, as Krutch would have it, stretches from the Gnostics and early Christians (Origen went as far as to castrate homself) to Shakespeare &quot;Lovers, madmen and poets are of imagination all compact&quot; to such 20th century figures as Yeats and the novelist Malcolm Lowry (who wrote a story after visiting Poe's memorial in Baltimore entitled &quot;Strange Comfort Afforded by the Profession&quot;).  What is most surprising to the modern reader is that no mention at all is made of Herman Melville, the American writer of the time who most resembled Poe in his psychology, who told Hawthorne of his desire &quot;to annihilate himself.&quot;<br />  The Gothic morbidity of Poe is unique in literature, and its correspondence to the reality of the Poe's own life is what makes it genuine.  It is unfortunately true that much of what Poe wrote was inane, vulgar, or simply untrue.  Yet, in his best work (such as &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;) that morbid purity Krutch mentions is manifested as in no other writer or artist.<br />  Krutch is at his best regarding Poe when he propounds, regarding those critical of his works, that &quot;it is bound to seem mere artifice unless they happen to have chords in their tempraments which respond to the neurotic melodies which arethe secret of his fascinations.&quot;<br />  Again, my problem is with this Freudian &quot;neurotic&quot; business.  The great traditions of spiritial mysticism and Romanticism cannot be simply filed away under this all too convenient convenient rubric.-Aside from this reservation, however, the biography is an exquisite and well-written description of Poe's unique contribution to literature, of his genius.cret of his fascinations.&quot;  <BR>   Again, my problem is with this Freudian &quot;neurotic&quot; business.

But I don't think this book was meant for either, hence its low estimation in their minds.  It was meant for readers who, like the book's hero (or what we might nowadays call antihero), Anthony Patch, see clearly: the emptiness of all endeavors in life not involving beauty.  I was reminded in reading this work of Yeats' lines &quot;What portion can the artist have who has awakened from the common dream but dissipation and despair.&quot;<br />  The book is not even truly a novel to my mind but rather as Tolstoy said of his &quot;War and Peace&quot; -&quot;a great swath of life.&quot;  Only &quot;Anna Karenina,&quot; which parallels &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in this<br />sense, did Tolstoy dub his &quot;novel.&quot;  This may be another way of saying that the book is what another reviewer denominates &quot;Naturalistic.&quot;  But, whatever it is, I much prefer its poetic lyricism to the arid artifice that constitutes &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; much as I infinitely prefer &quot;War and Peace&quot; to &quot;Anna Karenina.&quot;<br />  The flaws in the book (and the reason I gave it only 4 stars) arise when Fitzgerald veers from this three-dimensional writing style to the vapid and two-dimensional characterizations of many of Anthony's acquaintances: What is lacking is texture and background here.  Proust wrote about inane decadents as well, but did so in such a way that the reader gains perspective and insight into their condition.  This richness is sadly lacking in &quot;The Beautiful and Damned.&quot;<br />  But, aside from this somewhat technical flaw, the book's essential theme and philosophical import-that those who worship exclusively at the altar of Beauty must anticipate a high cost-make it one of the most important works of this century.  For beauty in all its earthly incarnations is quintessentially transient. This is nowhere made more clear than in Anthony's soliloquizing to Dot &quot;...you can't have anything at all.

It is WE who have something to learn from the Victorians and their masterworks, rather than (if time could be reversed) the other way around.  Lucy Snow is a spiritual hero, a concept seemingly lost in our modern age, to judge by most of the reviews anyway.  The very name &quot;Lucy&quot; signifies a spiritual light along with a sexual purity signified by &quot;Snow.&quot; that all of us in the modern age would do well to ponder and reasses our own souls thereby. I realize, of course, that the term &quot;soul&quot; is dreadfully outdated for many readers.  But read and learn that there is such a beautiful thing, not to be psychoanalyzed to dissolution. Read, for example:<br />&quot;No mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that to cultivate happiness.  What does such advice mean?  Happiness is not a potato, to be planted in mould, and tilled with manure.  Happpiness is a glory shining far down upon us out of Heaven.  She is a divive dew which the soul, on certain of its summer mornings, feels dropping upon it from the amaranth blooms and golden fruitage of Paradise.&quot;<br />  Through all of Lucy's companionless travails through unrequited and partially requited love, we feel the own deep personal love and light shining from her deep sensitive soul.  It reminds me of nothing so much as the poetry of Emily Dickinson...In fact, I would go so far to say that those without an appreciation of great poetry will gain little from reading this poetic novel. - Unrequited love builds character and, paradoxically, allows that love to become spiritual (There really is such a thing!) NOT &quot;sublimated.&quot;<br />  So, if you can relate to Emily Dickinson, to Yeats when he tells us that if his lifelong love for Maud Gonne had been requited he might have &quot;thrown poor words away and been content to live.&quot; or to Emily Dickinson's &quot;Not one of all the purple host who took the flag to-day can tell the definition so clear, of victory, as he, defeated, dying, on whose forbidden ear the distant strains of triumph break, agonized and clear.&quot; then pick up this book and follow Lucy through her travails.

I then lent it out, never to be returned.  (Ahem, I've become very cautious about lending books out since then.)  Anyway, I just recently repurchased this book and reread it, and I still (unlike Camus' himself) regard the LYRICAL essays herein as much more beautiful, powerful and significant than the much touted The Stranger (which I, however, like as well, only on another level.)<br />  It's quotes like the one above and &quot;Knowing that certain nights whose sweetness lingers will keep returning to the earth and sea after we are gone, yes, this helps us die.&quot; that make this collection of essays Camus' best work.<br />  The Stranger is, indeed, a unique contribution to post-WWII literature.  But these essays are unique as well as powerful and beautiful.  My bet is that, a century from now, these essays will be remembered long after the &quot;existentialist&quot; vogue has long faded, as Camus' best work.<br />  My apologies to those who worship terse, arid prose.  It has its place.  But it's not the stuff of truly great literature.  The lyrical essays contained herein are.	2001-11-02

Why?-  As an American who did not learn English history by heart, but absorbed it as part of an undergraduate European History class, my memory was jogged by the allusions to the War of the Roses, Wyatt's Revolt, iconoclasm etc. But methinks I learned more from that undergraduate textbook than from this semi-biography, which, to use one of the more precious phrases of the author's, is a &quot;sauve-qui-peut&quot; of styles and objectives.  The text is larded with such verbal flourishes...Pretentious?....Yes, for this book covers ground already covered and is short enough to be read in a day. It is NOT a scholar's endeavor. Moreover, its entwining of the speculative, the matter-of-fact, the sentimental effects a jarring effect upon the reader from chapter to chapter (indeed, within chapters).  Nevertheless, the book does manage to accomplish its basic goal and give the reader an idea of what the young Elizabeth was like and the influences upon her upbringing that were to influence her reign.-But, to my mind, this is not a book for those seriously interested in Elizabeth or her era. Go to the books recommended by the other reviewers for that.-This book is for beach readers who don't like to admit it.	2001-05-24

This for all of you autodidacts who love poring over your unabridged editions of the OED in search of abstruse verbal arcana and the history of obsolete verbiage (Ahem, I include myself in your number, of course.).  This is one aspect of this Gargantuan tome, and the most delightful one.  The other aspect is rather more nebulous:  What exactly is this book about, and why was it penned?  The obvious answer to the first part of the query is &quot;melancholy.&quot;  But melancholy, as here laid forth, is a seemingly ubiquitous and all-encompassing malady, as it were.  &quot;For indeed who is not a fool, melancholy, mad?&quot;  And who knows exactly why it was penned?  So little is known of Burton and the incidents of his life: Save, of course, that he was well-acquainted with the unfelicitous side of things. - There is a sweetness in his accounting of it though, that is oddly reminiscent of the subaqueous tones of Debussy. One is not surprised either to find that Keats was one of Burton's readers.-The same dulcet sadness lures us into a kind of bittersweet repose, as in the opening lines of the poet's &quot;Ode To A Nightingale.&quot;-Burton had a calling and this book was his answer to it.- All arguments in re the whys and wherefores are really for naught.- He had a calling and his answer remains a unique monument in Western literature, to be treasured and pored over again and again by all of us logophiles and solitary scholars...And anyone else, by the way.	2001-05-23

The author is David A. Morton III, M.D.  Consistent with other Nolo publications, Dr. Morton provides the layman with extensive case studies and copies of forms, so that seemingly abstract matters are made concrete and real to the layman.  Dr. Morton comes across as a responsible and concerned physician: Hippocratic rather than hypocritic.  He is, indeed, passionately concerned about new laws in the works that invite fraud by allowing non-medical personnel to review claims. He regales us with the &quot;crazy checks&quot; fiasco of the early 90's (pg.6/9) in which, due to a number of political factors, the SSA issued checks to nearly every parent who claimed his/her child had a disability.  He sees the agency returning to that sort of corruption in these new laws.  As he states at the end of Chapter Six, &quot;...the medical knowledge of even the worst doctors far exceeds that of examiners.&quot;  Thus, the book is at once an excellent hands-on manual in dealing with claims and a clarion call, awakening us to the infringement of our right to a medical review of our claims in this area.	2001-05-16

The prose in itself is beautifully written in a manner that few books of any sort are today.  If this lovely style is &quot;long-winded,&quot; as one reviewer dubbed it, then today's literary culture would do well to open the door and let some air in, regardless of the season!  The book that comes closest, oddly, to the style of Hall's masterpiece is the contemporary &quot;straight&quot; Bildungsroman of Thomas Wolfe-Look Homeward, Angel.  Hall is more effective, though, in bringing home &quot;the pain of all beauty,&quot; and I found myself having to put the bok down several times to clear the salty blur from my eyes, such is its poignancy.  Oddly again, the storyline of Hall's book and the plight of Stephen Gordon remind me of nothing so much as Rousseau in his Confessions.-Then again, none of this should really be surprising.  All three were sensitiive geniuses who suffered through much of their lives.

Are we all agreed? &quot;He was born a French aristocrat and lived as one;&quot; p.xix He came to observe and report democracy in America, NOT to unqualifiedly praise it (My apologies to Marc Antony).  Indeed, &quot;There is nothing more annoying than this irritable patriotism of the Americans.&quot; (p.227) that does not permit a foreigner to find fault with them. So he says.-This is indeed a great book and a great (i.e., faithful) translation. - By the way, why all this lather over the translation and the NYT review?  To heck with the NYT, even Gore Vidal (on a recent C-Span Booknotes) has recently called it a &quot;bad paper&quot; in its pomposity and Procrustean brand of liberalism. Harper's magazine also recently published a long article in re its suppressive tactics toward independent writers.-They do have good crossword puzzles though, particularly on Saturday.-To the matter at hand, De Tocqueville is simply accepting what he believes to be inevitable (democratic rule) and comparing and contrasting it with the aristocratic state and its mores to which he is accustomed.  I'm always baffled when I hear liberal or conservative voices citing this book in defense of their cause, because it seems clear to me that, though M. De Tocqueville finds much to praise in America, the underlying tone and theme is one of regret and nostalgia for a lost world of aristocratic mores.-I'm always reminded on these occasions of Ross Perot's trumpeting that Thoreau's &quot;The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.&quot; was the sentence that changed his life, only later to admit that he culled it from the Quotable Quotes section in Reader's Digest while sitting in a barber's chair rather than from an intensive study of Walden.-It seems to me that anyone who reads this translation or any other (unabridged) translation or the book in the original French cannot help but come away with this subterranean sense of nostalgia and regret.  To put his viewpoint in nutshell, he finds the inhabitants of democracy pusillanimous, small-souled, eager to get on with making a living and little else.  Almost all of the praise that flows from his pen for Americans is for some form of this &quot;virile&quot; practicality of the Americans, at which they excel.  It doesn't appear to have occurred to most American readers of this book that this might be a rather backhanded compliment coming from an aristocrat. Does not the reader take note of quotes such as &quot;One can conceive of nothing so small, so dull, so filled with miserable interests, in a word, so antipoetic, as the life of a man in the United States.&quot;p.461 Or, &quot;In aristocratic times one generally gets used to very vast ideas of the dignity, power, and greatness of man...they facilitate the natural spark of the mind toward the highest regions of thought and naturally dispose it to conceive a sublime and almost divine love of truth.&quot; p.436  I could go on with quote following quote, but (of course) my space is limited here.  To conclude, what makes this work great is the poignancy  and pathos of the observations of a man, a little lost, from a world that has crumbled.  One is reminded of Lott's wife somehow, looking back on what must have been a grand, if debauched, city as she headed into the wilderness.  What does he see?  On almost the last page of the proper text (p. 674), he sighs, &quot;The spectacle of this universal conformity saddens and chills me, and I am tempted to regret the society that is no longer.&quot; He doesn't turn into a pillar of salt, but one is not thrown off by the &quot;tempted&quot; equivocation.

I like Stephen Spender.  That is, of course, I like his poetry that I've read as well as his introduction to my favorite novel:Malcolm Lowry's Under The Volcano.  I like this book too.  But, first of all, there's altogether too much name-dropping, which becomes rather tedious at times.  Some of the anecdotes are quite rum, like the ones involving Lady Ottoline Morrel.  But all this Bloomsbury-Virginia Woolf business gets on one's nerves (well, mine anyway) after a while.  I don't think Spender's homosexual relationship is the most important thing in the book; though it was doubtless courageous of Spender to include it as well as indispensable to getting this book back in print!  The most important thing in the book is the difference in the pre- versus post- Spanish Civil War mindset among sensitive, well-bred intelllectuals among whom Spender was a figure.  Before the war, Spender says, it seemed that individuals (particularly idealists) could make a difference.  After the war, all that had not been killed fighting Franco (and there were many) were disillusioned and glum, especially Spender.  Finally, this book has a sad tone that runs from Spender's school days to his middle age.  He was a cultured, gifted writer who had not, by his middle ages, produced a &quot;great work.&quot;  And, despite the Queen's Gold Medal and Knighthood in later years, his melancholy grew worse.  He speaks of himself at the end of the book as &quot;rotted by a modicum of success&quot; and admits that &quot;My mistake was to think that my own nature would make everything easy.&quot;-The strange thing is that he didn't shake this attitude off.  He was only halfway through his life.  I was going to make put forth some hypotheses as to why, but, really, it's anybody's guess. Isn't it?	2001-03-18

As has been pointed out in the reviews, the author has a narrative talent absent from most science writing for the layman.  He is also an aesthete with polymathic talents and interests.  But herein lies the problem with the book.  One of those interests is theology.  One would have thought that most professional scientists would have learned by now to leave God out of the equation, since the question or even the meaning of the question, &quot;Does God exist?&quot; is scientifically unanswerable.  Carl Sagan, to whom one reviewer compares Thuan is acutely aware of this fact in all his writings.  Thuan doesn't exactly &quot;believe&quot; or have &quot;faith&quot; that God exists, but he concludes with a &quot;scientist's bet&quot; that something so complex and beautiful could not have arisen from chance.  His reasons for doing so are thus really aesthetic, not scientific.  He chooses to ignore that this world is not all art and beauty, but also massacres, bloodshed and mayhem:  Wars and rumors of wars.  His secret melody is really &quot;the music of the spheres&quot; a very poetic and understandable notion that originated in Ancient Greece(perhaps with Pythagoras), and which some relatively modern scientists, such as Kepler, were obsessed with, reformed to fit the discoveries of modern science.-Ultimately, Thuan, like Einstein, cannot bring himself to believe that our world evolved by chance.  His argument is basically, though he denies it, a first cause argument heavily disguised.  The orderliness of our world is caused by the secret melody. But what caused that? And what was the cause of what caused that? etc etc etc  And what, by the way, is the evidence for a &quot;secret melody&quot; or &quot;music of the spheres&quot; to begin with beside man's mystical aesthetic experience. These are ideas scientists eschewed long ago as, well, not scientific. There is an invidious whitewash of the darker side of human nature in all of this which one would think one glance at the last hundred years of human history would warrant at least some taking account of.  But to Thuan, as to Browning, &quot;God's in his Heaven an all's right with the world.&quot; At times, considering the things men have done to each other, one is glad to be informed that in a few million years our Sun will expand and burn any humanity left to a crisp, thus ending the atrocities (as well as the beauty Thuan is so enraptured with of course)that man has perpetrated and created.-Ultimately, Thuan cannot bring himself to consider honestly what the great British scientist and philosopher J.B.S. Haldane pointed out: that not only is the universe stranger than we imagine.  It's stranger than we CAN imagine.-Thuan takes the anthropic view, that the universe was created for the beauty enjoyed by us.  This is terribly unscientific and egotistical.  As Bertrand Russell pointed out, we are told that evolution from the earthworm to man constitutes &quot;progress.&quot;  But nobody has asked the earthworm his opinion on the subject.of this which one would think one glance at the last hundred years of human history would warrant at least some taking account of.

Leavis dismisses the first lines of Shelley's towering, contemplative poem &quot;Mount Blanc&quot; (along with all the rest of Shelley's poetry, one might add) as &quot;...insortably and indistinguishably confused.&quot;  The lines in question: &quot;The everlasting universe of things flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves, now dark-now glittering-now reflecting gloom-now lending splendour, where from secret springs the source of human thought its tribute brings of waters-with a sound but half its own...&quot;  These first few lines of the great poem are not that hard to make sense of if one but puts forth half an effort: The contemplative human mind is the passive recepient of all it perceives (i.e., the everlasting universe of things) which like a great river in different parts of its course will exhibit differing reflections and imaginings; whereas the mind, &quot;the source of human thought&quot; is but a tributary to this great river, &quot;with a sound but half its own.&quot;  In other words, mere human thoughts pale in comparison to the torrent of impressions (i.e., the everlasting universe of things) flowing through the mind.  But Leavis had his mind made up, and it is doubtful he even gave the poem a chance, such was his animus for Shelley, as evinced in the rest of his essay-But there, C.S. Lewis in his essay in defense of Shelley offers a fine riposte, &quot;I address myself, of course, only to those who are prepared, by toleration of the theme, to let the poem have a fair hearing.  For those who are not, we can only say that they may doubtless be very worthy people, but they have no place in the European tradition.&quot;-Ouch!-And also Pottle in his fine essay, &quot;The Case of Shelley,&quot; attributes such dismissals as that of Mr. Leavis to &quot;...the very human but unregenerate passion for bullying other people.&quot;  OK, I've said more than enough for the prospective reader to get an idea of what this book is about: the continuing battle over what the Romantics are all about and what they mean to us, if anything.  I, personally, would hope the reader would come away from this book with a refreshed notion of how precious and indispensable they are to our appreciation of all poetry and, moreover, to this life itself.	2001-03-09

These stories are, as a previous reviewer has noted, on the darker side of things, no doubt as a resullt of WWI, in which Doyle lost his son.  One even takes place, for the most part, in America, of all places!-There's always this comfortable, almost fairy tale sense in all of the Holmes' stories of this magic Victorian nightworld which Holmes and Watson float above in their upper middle class ease, and which we know (except in one story not in this book) that all will be well with the two friends in the end.  Even when we know we are being duped, as when cigar ashes or some other peculiar evidence appears and Holmes announces &quot;Surely you've read my monograph on the subject,&quot; and proceeds to expound upon their significance to the case, we are still pleased, like an opium smoker taking another drag from his pipe and drifting back to Xanadu.  Like all Holmes' stories, these are bound to keep you turning the pages, as well as to enchant you thus.-Doyle's stories are so enchanting, in fact, that in the most recent issue of the New York Review of Books it is revealed that most Taiwanese believed that they were true and that London was a cobblestoned city perpetually inundated in fog!-A very nice compilation, indeed, with all the original drawings from The Strand.	2001-03-08

Lowry's novel is also autobiographical, his antihero is also a former government worker, a former British Consul (&quot;defrocked&quot; as Lowry puts it) intent on drinking himself to death amidst the poverty in a pre-WWII Mexican village, who, due to circumstances beyond his control, runs afoul of the local Fascist police who...well anyway....Sound familar?....Given, Lowry's novel towers over Bingham's in its philosophical depth, linguistic and poetic beauty, mystical contemplation and, of course, British mastery of subtle drollery, much as the majestic Mexican snow-capped volcano Popocatapetl in Lowry's work towers over anything in the comparatively nondescript landscape in Bingham's Cambodia.-But this is set in the Nineties, not Lowry's  Thirties, when authors could still get away with publishing poetic prose that astonishes with its beauty.-But Bingham has all of Lowry's cavalier bravado that comes from looking into the face of death without the comfortable illusions of the Danish missionary.-Don't you reviewers criticizing the drug use know that the most sensitive and perceptive individuals turn out to be the most thoroughgoing escapists?-Just take a look at the  great poets, novelists and playwrights of the last 2 centuries: Sots, pill-poppers and suicides almost to a one. Likewise James Dickey (yet another on the list) once told an interviewer for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (sometime in the Spring of 1993), &quot;Poets are people commonly perceived as weak.&quot; So are novelists such as Bingham, because they perceive so intensely and are down on themselves for not being able to live up to their noble ideals.  In Chapter Ten, Bingham has Asher soliloquizing,&quot;No, his ends were still noble.  Nostos, the arduous Homeric journey homeward, was his end.  But nostos had to be achieved, did it not?  It must be gained by certain means, and the means,oh,..., he could not escape the means.  They were rotten.&quot;  When they are walking along the path after being kidnapped, Julie exclaims that he is (half teasingly?) &quot;decadent nihilism personified.&quot; Asher disdainfully, honestly and drolly replies, &quot;Stop it. I'm a spiritualist and a Merchant Prince.&quot;-So...here we have our Byronic hero of the Nineties!  It may take a while to be realized as such, but this book, more than any of the Nineties decade, carries forth the torch of Romanticism in an increasingly homogenized and darkening world. 4 stars: It just doesn't measure up to Lowry, whose Under the Volcano I recommend to all the favorable to Bingham lot.----Oh,... who described the Khmer as &quot;kind&quot; or  &quot; nice&quot; or some such.

I've never been a fan of Samuel Johnson.  The greater writer and more interesting character, to my mind, has always been Boswell.  I don't doubt that Boswell had a sincere affection for the man, but I sometimes wonder if Boswell (perhaps subconsciously) duped Johnson into letting him write his biography as well as this account of their travels to show him up.  Time and time again, Johnson shows himself to be, well, a curmudgeon, both in word and deed.  From his comments on Hume, the great Scottish philosopher and historian, &quot;I know not indeed whether he has first been a blockhead and that has made him a rogue, or first been a rogue and that has made him a blockhead.&quot; to his ordering Boswell back by his side when Boswell was just trying to ride ahead and prepare things for his arrival (all according to Boswell, of course), Boswell's Johnson does not come off very well.  Though Boswell attests to his worship of the &quot;Great Cham&quot; again and again, one can't help wondering if there was a smirk on Boswell's face as he penned this journal of their travels...Surely, it had to have occurred to him that readers would come away with a snicker or two at his descriptions of what almost seems a straw man for Boswell's sharp pen.  I, for one, am not convinced by his show of naive devotion to Johnson.-What then was Boswell trying to do?  Make a name for himself, of course.  And what better way than to associate himself indelibly with the man many considered the greatest literary figure of the time.-He was very successful in doing so, and his writings are now much more in demand by readers than anything written by Johnson, who, in turn, has turned out to be the &quot;harmless drudge&quot; he ironically defined himself as in the dictionary that made him famous.  Finally, then, my verdict on the book is that it is passing weird.-Weird, in that the psychological interplay always just below the suface in Boswell's account of the journey leaves the reader in constant doubt throughout the book as to Boswell's true intent in writing his descriptions of Johnson.-Was Boswell smirking with a mercenary eye to the future of his own literary reputation, writing ludicrous descriptions of a man considered great at the time, all beneath a faux-naif bluster?-I, for one, am convinced that, at least subconsciously, he was.-But this is what, for me, makes the book so much more intriguing than your average day-in, day-out journal.-4 stars though because it's still a journal and makes for yawns at times.oubt throughout the book as to Boswell's true intent in writing his descriptions of Johnson.-Was Boswell smirking with a mercenary eye to the future of his own literary reputation, writing ludicrous descriptions of a man considered great at the time, all beneath a faux-naif bluster?-I, for one, am convinced that, at least subconsciously, he was.-But this is what, for me, makes the book so much more intriguing than your average day-in, day-out journal.-4 stars though because it's still a journal and makes for yawns at times.	2001-03-06

I knew Dickey during his final years.  I met him once and had several phone conversations with him.  He approved of the title of my, as yet, unpublished novel, Seamarks, and was always encouraging me with remarks such as &quot;I'm on yo' side son.&quot;  So perhaps I'm biased in some way, fashion or form.-Chris Dickey is a journalist, not a biographer or poet.  And what is the goal of every journalist?  To get the &quot;scoop,&quot; to be the first to have the story hit the presses, something that Chris Dickey was exclusively qualified to do with his access to his father in those waning years and his own memories.  He has succeeded.-Bravo Chris!-Every journalist has to have this killer instinct, as Chris well knows.  Otherwise, he wouldn't be Paris Bureau Chief for Newsweek, but to apply these standards to memoirs concerning his own father's life!?!  Contrary to what many folks think, Dickey will be remembered for his early poetry, which was, indeed, great; as opposed to the novel Deliverance which, as literature, was merely mediocre.  In this memoir, Chris Dickey places a microscope on all his fathers drunken sprees, adulteries, braggadocios etc. rather than the beauty of his poetry or his courage as an artist, which get short shrift until the very end.  For example, Chris recounts his father's recitation of the (autobiographical?) poem &quot;Adultery&quot; at Rice University with his wife and family in the audience.  Just before the recitation, Chris compares his father to &quot;...a teenager who's been jerking off...&quot; and, after the poem, &quot;F you, Dad.&quot;  Make of this what you will.  Matters this emotional are never fully resolved (as some reviewers have suggested) just as some wounds never heal. I have to recommend Henry Hart's recently published biography, The World As A Lie (The title was suggested by Dickey himself before he died.), which soars, in so many ways, above what seems at times a rather petty memoir.  I also recomend to Chris Dickey (and any other readers who may be interested) Balzac's Illusions Perdues (Lost Illusions) which portrays the pitfalls and corruption inherent in the journalistic trade.-3 stars, because it's about J. Dickey and because we have to give Chris the benefit of the doubt.s, in so many ways, above what seems at times a rather petty memoir.

Certainly, more liveliness is needed here to keep one's rapt attention.  But, of course, this is a fault inherent in journals as a genre, such as those of Samuel Pepys for instance, every day can not be a page out of The Three Musketeers. Chestnut, as has been noted, is both cultured and independently minded, debunking the myths of Southern ignorance and complacency, especially among women.  This alone makes the book an interesting read.  Nevertheless, one grows weary after a while, slogging along to the pathetic outcome that we know awaits the trials under which this woman bears up so bravely.-What interested me the most was that, at times, there are sparks of poetic insight that could have sprung straight from Faulkner or even Proust, such as &quot;Of all our sorrows, memory is the worst.&quot; p.102 or &quot;Time works its wonders like enchantment.&quot; p.141  One ponders what would have been the outcome had Ms. Chestnut turned her hand to novels or poetry!-I only gave the book 4 stars because of the expurgation of the journals and the slogging reading at times.  But I'm going to check out the texts mentioned by the previous reviewer and hopefully return with an extra star tacked on to my reviews.	2001-03-04

Eliot and the soi-disant New Criticism, both of which defined themselves, to a great extent, by despising the Romantics and in seeking to give the lie to their poetic ability and influence. Neither school is now given much account, while the Romantics are still with us.-The problem with a book defending the Romantics and explaining their poetry is that you are attempting to explain what the poets themselves saw as inexplicable, the vision of the visionary company is that of a divine beauty not of this world making itself known to the poets not at the summoning of their will, but, as Shelley beautifully puts it, like a sudden wind firing a fading coal.  It would be a futile endeavor to go over the texts of each of the poets in this necessarily brief review and explain, as Bloom does, how this vision manifested itself in each of them.-That's, after all, what the book's for!-But, as an example, take the final poem of one of Bloom's and my favorite of the Visionary Commpany, Shelley.  His unfinished, final poem before he drowned at the age of 30, &quot;The Triumph of Life,&quot; is an almost perfect example of why defending the Romantics is such a difficult and complex task, and why this book is such a triumph for Bloom.  The &quot;Triumph of Life&quot; describes a public way thronged with people &quot;All hastening onward, yet none seemed to know whither he went, or whence he came, or why...&quot;.  This is the plight not only of the common man, but of kings, potentates etc. (Napolean makes a brief and horrid appearance).  Then follows behind a blazing chariot, which is Life here on Earth as we commonly know it, and that light blinds all to the moon and stars, symbols of Nature and Imagination, respectively.  Thus Shelley learns, in common with all the Romantics who had not the luck that Keats had, of dying young, that the &quot;spark with which heaven lit my spirit&quot; is no match eventually for the blinding light of Life.  This view of common life, devoid of poetic vision, as, frankly, something evil, is a difficult matter to explain to those who have not shared in the vision.  But, intellectually, it's subject matter should not appear strange.  It amounts to the Fall of Man, as described Biblically.-The upshot of all this for the poet, who now sees life as evil, is that, quoting Bloom, &quot;Life, our life, can be met only by quietism or by willful self-destruction.&quot;  This echoes some lines by that later (some would say last) Romantic, Yeats, &quot;What portion can the artist have, who has awakened from the common dream, but dissipation and despair?&quot;-This is hard and unpleasant to many, but it is logical, and makes sense of what the aforementioned literary schools trampled on as sentimental cheeseparings.  This then is the book's triumph. No longer can these poets and their poetry be dismissed without contending with Bloom.  A formidable obstacle indeed!light blinds all to the moon and stars, symbols of Nature and Imagination, respectively.

And when I do hear people talking about or reading writings on his poetry, it is the same cliched talk of the roistering, life-embracing, obscene (for the times) poet of democracy...Whatever exactly that may mean....This deathbed edition gives the lie to this absurdly one dimensional view of a poet who, as it turns out, is actually just as or more concerned with death as with life.  Consider some of the following quotes: &quot;And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than death&quot;(p.16)...&quot;And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.&quot;(p.25)...&quot;Has anyone supposed it lucky to be born? I hasten to inform him or her that it is just as lucky to die...&quot;(p.25)...&quot;What indeed is finally beautiful except death and love?&quot;(p.87)...&quot;O Soul....pondering the themes that thou lovest best, Night, sleep, death and the stars.&quot;(p.360)-These are but a few of the quotes that led me to appreciate Walt Whitman as a poet and not some sort of advertising agent for his own ego.  The common conception based on a few lines of a few of his poems does him a serious injustice.-This deathbed edition gives us the full scope of his poetic gift.  I recommend it to all who are willing to take the time to understand the multidimensional quality of Whitman and his poetry.	2001-03-02

If you think you know everything about Thoreau's Walden, think again.  This book is full of fascinating footnotes that shed light on particular turns of phrase and allusions that one thought one had grasped.  The footnotes are particularly illuminating in re turns of phrases that have gone out of style.  To learn, for instance, that train wrecks and such were commonly referred to as &quot;melancholy accidents&quot; in the papers of the time, lends an otherwise missing mordant wit to Thoreau's criticism of the railroad when he says that &quot;it will be perceived that a few are riding while the rest are run over-and it will be called, and will be, 'A Melancholy Accident'.&quot;-Absolutely delightful! Why is this book out of print with so many purported lovers of Thoreau out there?!?	2001-03-01

You just can't reconcile the sublimity of Wordsworth with the current mush by quoting, over and over again, his Preface to the Lyrical Ballads that poetry should consist of the speech of the common man...Yes, but it still has to be poetry!...But let's not dwell on these (in my opinion) futile endeavors to reconcile Wordsworth with modern poetry...There are two excellent essays here: one by Louis Simpson, the other by Robert Pinsky. The Simpson essay draws the felicitous (and well-documented) connection between Wordsworth and Proust while Pinsky's is a masterful piece on how the Romantics shaped our view of the spiritual life of a modern city.  Simpson simply states the obvious to anyone with poetic and spiritual sensibilities, that great literature is about transcendent experiences that, well, intimate immortality.  Simpson explains how Proust's fascination with Ruskin brought him in contact with Wordsworth.  And to Simpson belongs my favorite sentence in the entire book: &quot;It is for want of contact with the infinity Proust speaks of that the theory of literature is, at the present time, in such a dreary state.&quot;...Good Show Louis!...Pinsky's essay is easily the best of the lot, seemingly effortlessly demonstrating, in fifteen short pages, by quoting at length from Blake, Wordsworth, Baudelaire, and Hart Crane how the Romantics have more or less, consciously or not, established in our minds what the modern city is, spiritually and physically.-This book gets four stars for these two essays and a couple bright spots in some of the others.  Sadly, though, I think it mostly a failure.  Modern literature is a far cry from the Romantics.  I don't think they would even recognize it as literature.  The bridge the book attempts to build is an admirable attempt.  But collapses in its very inception. It is, indeed, a bridge too far.ey would even recognize it as literature.

These essays are, happily, far too short to be called &quot;resurrections&quot; of these figures.  Auchincloss realizes that it takes a well-received, deeply researched book on just one subject to achieve such a mammoth task.  So, he urbanely unveils to us these mostly forgotten writers, briefly explaining why he thinks they deserve recognition and then moves on to the next subject...One of the finest things about this book is that Auchincloss does not beat his head against the wall trying to convince you of the writers' worth. Either the artist catches on with you or not. For instance, in his piece on Sarah Orne Jewett, he concludes, &quot;And some persons are never going to believe that two semiliterate old farmers' widows sitting on a crumbling back porch in a decayed Maine coastal village are going to have much to say that will interest them.&quot;-It's this urbanity and ease-of-style that make this little book so pleasant a read.	2001-02-26

For his book on death is simply...beautiful.  How he managed to cull so many varied and poignant accounts of and perspectives on death from literary (and non-literary) sources is nothing short of astounding.  Of course, Enright has already won the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry.  Is there also a gold medal for Death over there?  If so, he is thoroughly entitled to it.  It's rare that a literary work is such a page-turner as this one is.  Everyone will have their favorite passages.  My two are Bede's comparing life to the quick flight of the sparrow in through one end of the lord's hall and out the other in the twinking of an eye, with ignorance as to its plight both before and after; and the Ashanti saying, &quot;Every time an earth mother smiles over the birth of a child, a spirit mother weeps over the loss of a child.&quot;-But, as I say, these are but two drops in an ocean of fine thoughts and sentiments and imaginings.-Recommended reading for all mortals!	2001-02-25

I am usually (rightfully so, I tend to discover) on my guard against phychological attempts at describing authors and their motivations.  But I decided to take my chance on this one and was pleasantly surprised.  Mainly, because the book, ultimately, is not a psychological intrusion into the inner sanctum of each writer's life examined here. It is ultimately about the absence of what Schneiderman calls &quot;the ability to idealize love objects&quot; in the twentieth century, as compared to the nineteenth.  Thus, it is more a history of the breakdown of values (psychological and otherwise), leading to the inability of the characters in the modern novels to fall in love, than the diagnoses of a psychologist poking his nose in where it's not wanted (and liable to be cut off) as so many of these psychological forays into literature are.-The idea of this book then is that the twentieth century artist's pain caused by his alienation from an increasingly impersonal world is the fuel for his creativity, a creativity marred by an essentially escapist motivation, and Schneiderman makes a good case for this perspective.-The problem is that there are too many &quot;ids,&quot; &quot;egos,&quot; &quot;superegos&quot; and other Freudianisms that bog down the prose. Otherwise, a though-provoking read for all who take literature and beauty seriously.	2001-02-24

To begin with, with few exceptions, one of the primary qualifications of being a full-fledged academic is delight in derision, especially in derision of those who have firsthand knowledge of the subjects they have spent hours in the stacks on University libraries to gain, perhaps, one mote of additional information.-The common criticism of Trelawny is that he was &quot;naive&quot;-By this they mean that his gives a simple, straightforward account of the time he spent with the two great poets without any ponderous theories to bog him down.-Trelawny first admired Byron, but quickly became disillusioned with his cynicism and became a lifelong admirer of Shelley, so much so that he remarked thus, &quot;As a general rule,threfore, it is wise to avoid writers whose works amuse or delight you, for when you see them they will delight you no more.  Shelley was a grand exception to this rule.  To form a just idea of his poetry, you should have witnessed his daily life; his words and actions best illustrated his writings.&quot;  After Shelley's death, he continues to follow Byron on his misadventures until his death. The book is a treat in that it is a delight to read, with page-turning accounts of his roistering times with two great men who shaped our literary world.-Not one footnote!  He was there!	2001-02-23

I'm limiting my critique to what I find most fascinating and controversial in the work, contained in the first chapter, The Prose of Apocalypse, where Bullock finds marked similarities between a passage of Junger's and Shelley's &quot;Mount Blanc.&quot;  Bullock (perhaps because he is a professor of German?) finds that Junger and his teutonic colleague Benjamin plumb greater depths than Shelley.  Thus, for Bullock, what look at first to be similarities merely point to the greater depth of Junger's metaphysics.  Here is the difference: Junger says, &quot;...the unity and multiplicity of our so mysterious world are hidden&quot;; while Shelley says, &quot;The secret strength of things which governs thought, and to the infinite dome of heaven is a law, inhabits thee!  And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea, if to the human mind's imaginings silence and solitude were vacancy?&quot;  The last question of Shelley's poem is clearly rhetorical and it is clear that Shelley sees a &quot;secret stength of things&quot; in this poem where Junger feels only only hidden, perhaps dark, mystery.-But this comparison, meant to show that Junger is the more profound, is hardly fair to Shelley and, in fact, sets the great English poet up as a foil.-What, if instead of &quot;Mount Blanc,&quot; Bullock had chosen Shelley's ironic, despairing poem, &quot;The Triumph of Life,&quot; unfinished because Shelley drowned himself before completion?  Its images are darker by far than Junger's, a parade of grotesque twisted shapes ravaged by time, and Shelley's last line, after a lifetime and a mass of work delving into these dark metaphysical matters is heartshattering, &quot; 'Then what is life?' I cried.&quot;-Bullock, in fairness to him, later in the book seems to imply not so much that the Germans gazed deeper into the abyss than a poet like Shelley.  But that Junger's &quot;auratic prose&quot; is somehow better writing.  The reader must, of course, be the judge of this.  I personally find what Bullock calls (not altogether complimentarily) Shelley's attachment to the &quot;sublime&quot; and Junger's manly confrontation with the abyss a more than somewhat nonsensical and tendentious semantic wordplay.-Both men were interested in the sublime and both courageously confronted the abyss.-Bullock more or less admits this later on.-One should always be careful using terms like &quot;the sublime&quot; and &quot;the abyss.&quot;  They've been the subjects of so much academic doublespeak over the years that one hardly knows what one means by using them anymore.-Enough said, anyone interested in Junger (or Shelley, for that matter) should read this book.  Anything that provokes thought and meditation is so rare these days.er's &quot;auratic prose&quot; is somehow better writing.  The reader must, of course, be the judge of this.

It combines a Proustian dredging through the mystery of time and memory with a Faulknerian sense of the harsh poverty of the South and its effects on the human soul as well as Faulkner's own sense of the mysteries of human memory, all written down with touches of fine lyricism.-The problem is, and I realize that I'm in the minority in this opinion, that it's impossible for an author to combine these fine traits and have any hope of getting his work published without mangling, yes mangling, it into a &quot;mystery&quot; where it can rest comfortably in that section in Barnes and Noble and be sure to sell.  Proust and Faulkner, with their sense of the artist's obligation to be true to his calling, to not retrench their work to fit the marketplace, wouldn't stand a chance in this day and age.  I wish Mr. Grimsley had the luxury to explore more into the psyches of the characters (which he does so well), I wish he would give full-rein to his lyricism and, above all, I wish he didn't have to fit this into the genre of &quot;mystery.&quot;-All life is a mystery.-But then the book would be at least as long and complex as a Faulkner novel. And how many of you reviewers would have bought it?-No, the work will not be regarded as a masterpiece.  What &quot;mystery&quot; is?  The simple truth is that they don't cover the grand swath of light and dark in the human soul (though Mr. Grimsley does his best) because they have to fit into a formula, which by definition limits their scope, however gracefully, as is the case here.-This book is a good page-turner, as most mysteries are, and (as other reviwers have noted) Mr. Grimsley has an acute insight into the feminine perspective, as embodied by the character of Ellen Tote.  All this being said, I'm afraid the book will be forgotten in ten years time, replaced by other &quot;mysteries.&quot;	2001-02-20

It is also a good way to keep yourself laughing continuously in impish delight for several hours as Russell skewers dogma after dogma.  One is reminded of nothing so much as a lightweight master of the epee skipping through an army of Goliaths armed with heavy truncheons and running his sword through them, one after another,  before they know what has happened.-Just one example, the philosophic Goliath known as Aristotle: &quot;Aristotle, in spite of his reputation, is full of absurdities.  He says that children should be conceived in the winter, when the wind is in the north, and that if people marry too young the children will be female.  He tells us that the blood of the female is blacker than that of males...that women have fewer teeth than men and so on.  Nevertheless, he is considered by the great majority of philosophers a paragon of wisdom.&quot;  So much for Aristotle.  He also never tires of skewering the clergy in general and their obscurantism.  One of the most amusing sections is his account of the clergy's reaction to the invention of the lighning-rod: &quot;When Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning-rod, the clergy, both in England and America, with the enthusiastic support of George III, condemned it as an impious attempt to defeat the will of God. For, as all right-thinking people were aware, lightning is sent by God to punish impiety or some other grave sin-the virtuous are never struck by lightning.  Therefore if God wants to strike anyone, Benjamin ought not to defeat His design...&quot;  Finally, he wasn't above a little irony in his self-penned obituary by an imaginary Obit. writer, &quot;...His life, for all its waywardness, had a certain anachronistic consistency, reminiscent of the aristocratic rebels of the early nineteenth century.  His principles were curious, but, such as they were, they governed his actions.  In private life he showed none of the acerbity that marred his writings, but was a genial conversationalist and not devoid of human sympathy...&quot;-Nobody with even the slightest mote of skepticism toward all the nonsense that's passed for wisdom and deep philosophy in ages heretofore and with a spark of life and sense of humor can leave this book without a lighter heart than when he or she first picked it up.-I can't think of any higher praise for a book.erbity that marred his writings, but was a genial conversationalist and not devoid of human sympathy...&quot;-Nobody with even the slightest mote of skepticism toward all the nonsense that's passed for wisdom and deep philosophy in ages heretofore and with a spark of life and sense of humor can leave this book without a lighter heart than when he or she first picked it up.-I can't think of any higher praise for a book.	2001-02-18

Army from the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany	Books	5	11	14	N	N	Expendability-American style	I'm a WWII buff and so the accounts of the strategies and the battles and the movement of forces wasn't that new to me.  But these things are not what this book is about.  This book is about what Winston Churchill said won the war &quot;...The American soldier.&quot;  It makes for heart-gripping and page-turning reading.  I was familiar, as most who have read about the final days of the ETO campaign are, with Hitler using brainwashed young boys to fight to the bitter end.  What I was NOT, and am now acutely familiar with, through Ambrose's use of quotes from veterans who were front-line soldiers throughout the book, is the fact that our government did nearly the same thing, sending 18-year-olds fresh out of boot camp to the front lines both before, after and during the Battle of the Bulge when the older soldiers were swept away by the Germans or died of cold and hunger (or, not infrequently, insanity) in their frozen foxholes.  Frequently, of course, many of the replacements faced the same fate.  But we always had replacements for replacements. We had such a supply of men and materiel by the war's end.-The book brought home to me, as nearly as any vicarious experience can, what it means to be freezing, hungry, besieged by enemies and, worst of all, with a feeling in the pit of your soul that your death won't matter, that you are expendable. A must read for those interested in life (and death) from the perspective of the &quot;grunts.&quot;	2001-02-17

H. Hudson, a 19th Century version of O'Hanlon in South America. I particularly recommend Hudson's Green Mansions as a starting point.  There are differences in the writers (100 years, and two different continents to start off with).  Further, Hudson is the more poetic and better writer in my opinion, but that's something for each reader to decide on his or her own.-In any case, they both belong to that peculiar English tradition of intrepid, eccentric explorers bumbling about in foreign regions full of lethal flora, fauna and humanity all the while making endearing and heroic fools of themselves to the natives and the readers.  O'Hanlon's quest is particularly baroque: searching for a reported dinosaur in Lake Tele in the Congo basin, and one is only surprised that O'Hanlon's American companion Lary didn't make him sign his release note a hundred pages earlier: &quot;I, Redmond, declare that I am going to the Lake Tele deathtrap of my own free will and I hereby forgive Lary his escape.&quot;  O'Hanlon's attachment to the gorillla Bobo is undoubtedly the most touching part of the book (and one of the exceedingly few parts where the title does not apply.) I would say that it shows O'Hanlon's essential &quot;humanity&quot; except that, after O'Hanlon's discourse on the similarity of our two species, I'm not at all sure it's the appropriate term-O'Hanlon informs us that the Western Bantu word for &quot;hero&quot; comes from the verb meaning &quot;to enter oblivion, to be lost, to become a spirit.&quot;-O'Hanlon has certainly proved himself a hero in this sense! One is tempted to exclaim &quot;Good Show!&quot; at the end of the book if only for this reason.-I only gave the book 4 stars because, as I said, Hudson's just a notch above him in my opinion.	2001-02-16

What is meant by &quot;Modern&quot;? Does &quot;Modern&quot; mean what was modern in 1900, or now, or a thouroughly different perspective on things extending from 1900 to the present? The book offers no real answer.-The overall effect of the book is that of small, extremely academic, essays crammed together without any bridges between them to explain what Lucas is trying to do here besides provide an anthology of his essays.  Apparently, according to the flyleaf, we are to pay &quot;close attention to key words and phrases&quot; if we are to see how this book offers an invaluable contribution to &quot;critical methodology.&quot;  Take it from an old English Lit. Graduate student, this is but another contribution to academic doublespeak. Just read the essays on their own.  They aren't half-bad.  But, in general, run for the hills when you start hearing terms like &quot;critical methodology.&quot;  Terms like these destroy the meaning in language (Thus, of course, destroying language itself) and, further, push many a graduate student toward despair.	2001-02-15

Passing strange, isn't it, that reading about one's mortality tends to make one more resigned to it?-I have to admit to having a favorite here: Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Aes Triplex,&quot; perhaps my favorite essay anywhere, although it's only printed in part here.

The last American novel this poetic and difficult for those not attuned to the music of words that made it big and, in fact, bears a certain resemblence to Ms. Kingsolver's work is The Sound and The Fury, by none other than Willy Faulkner.  There are echoes of other works as well.  One reviewer has already mentioned The Mosquito Coast by Theroux.  There's also the short story &quot;Rain&quot; by W.S. Maugham.  Even though Kingsolver has her characters actually mention The Heart of Darkness in the book, the themes are so different that I don't think there's much of a comparison between the works.  Conrad's work is focussed so exclusively on Man, Kurtz or Marlowe, while Kingsolver takes in everything under the sun and moon and stars.-But let me return, how can any book that has quotes like this from the deformed genius Adah (much resembling the clairvoyant Benji in The Sound and The Fury) be so popular!?! &quot;Presentiment-is that long Shadow-on the Lawn- Indicative that Suns go down- The Notice to the startled Grass That Darkness-is about to pass-  Pity the poor dumb startled grass, I do.

Books	4	12	13	N	N	A short, interesting look at a unique man	It's hard to give anything this short 5 stars-hence my four, especially when so much more information is desired.  No doubt we'll get it when his Journals all get translated into English.  Anybody who has read Storms of Steel and On The Marble Cliffs (in English) will sympathize.  There's apparenntly much that gets lost in the translations now available and the books remain to a great extent, opaque, especially stylistically.-This short dialogue with Hervier nevertheless contains many interesting things.  I haven't heard a writer come out and confess to a &quot;taste for decadent literature&quot; in quite some time as if there were nothing to it. Decadent has become synonymous with bad in the past century in the English-speaking world.  Not since Yeats  has a prominent writer in English spoken up for the Decadents.  Also interesting is his admission that Rimbaud's &quot;The Drunken Boat&quot; transformed his life &quot;from top to bottom.&quot;  Junger says, &quot;...decadence releases forces that would otherwise remain dormant, feeble.  A sick man often discovers colors and sounds that are far more subtle than he suspected when he was in good health.  That's something that often appears on a death mask, the lux aeterna, the great radiance.&quot; and he continues later, &quot;everything is ambivalent...to the extent that everything has its bright side and its dark side; and the latter is indispensable.&quot;  These quotations reveal Junger as more than the enlightened mystic.  They put him firmly in English in that &quot;Decadent&quot; tradition that includes Yeats, Djuna Barnes, and Malcolm Lowry.  And in German, he admits to admiring the lucidity of Nietzsche's remarks even after madness has taken hold. None of this is particularly surprising, mystical writing and a taste for the decadent and unearthly are almost always combined in some way.  It's just refreshing to hear someone come out and say it without fear of the critics (One gets the impression, however mistaken it may be, that Junger is not afraid of much of anything.)-This is a good little book, even if the dialogue is a bit rambling....We'll just have to wait for the Journals for a more comprehensive view of this fascinating man.  In the meantime, I recommend an essay Bruce Chatwin wrote on Junger and his Journals before they both died for the New York Review of Books entitled &quot;An Aesthete at War.&quot;  One of the starkest images is of Junger surveying a death camp and commenting, in Chatwin's translation, &quot;My daughters will pay for this in a brothel for niggers.&quot;-As I said, neither was Junger afraid of the Nazis at the time (whose SS leaders wanted him locked up or worse for his writings.) or of modern sensibilities!-Where are those Journals?!?aken it may be, that Junger is not afraid of much of anything.)-This is a good little book, even if the dialogue is a bit rambling....We'll just have to wait for the Journals for a more comprehensive view of this fascinating man.

Higgins does offer original insights, though, and untangles snarls in Nietzsche's thought in ways that hadn't occurred to me.-The most important of these clarifications is her explanation of eternal recurrence by analogy with how we appreciate music.  It's somewhat amusing to me that the book she uses to demonstrate this striking similarity, Victor Zuckerkandl's Sound and Symbol: Music and the External World, was required reading in a Music Appreciation class I was required to take as an undergraduate.-Alas, I was too interested in drinking beer then to make any sort of connection, though perhaps Nietzsche himself would have found this more &quot;life affirming&quot; for me at the time!-Higgins, if I read her aright, regards &quot;eternal recurrence&quot; more as a state of mind than as a scientific theory, though it may be both. As she puts it, &quot;Music resists any attempts to deny its immediacy and to wed it to the past....The past and future are both connected with the awareness of the present tone, but not as specific past and future events.&quot; And, as Zuckerkandl nails it down, &quot;Let anyone capable of it call to mind the immediately preceding tone of a melody he is hearing.  The instant he does so, he will have lost the thread of the melody.&quot;  Life lived at its highest level, then, is a sort of music where one lives intensely in the moment, full of what Higgins calls &quot;the wild magic of living&quot; while themes recur over and over again without our memory having to intrude, so to speak.-This is the best explanation of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence I have read.  Previously, it was always the big sticking point for me in the book, and I dismissively (like many others) assumed this was the point where he started to go mad.-Strangely, I was reminded by Higgins' comparison of music and eternal recurrence of nothing so much as the acccount of the beginning of the world in Tolkien's The Silmarillion where life begins as different strains of music. They both lend considerable spiritual and creative heft to melody.- I only gave the book four stars because so much of the early part of the book was old hat to me. But the book as a whole is the best comprehensive introduction to Nietzsche's Zarathustra that I've read. The Menippean satire comparison she presents to explain Part IV seemed redundant to me because I've never had a problem with Part IV, though obviously many others have.  This is probably due in great part due to the fact that I approach much of Nietzsche through one of his greatest disciples, the poet Yeats.  And when, in Part IV, Nietzsche exhorts the higher men, &quot;What does it matter that you are failures?...learn to laugh away over yourselves!&quot;, lines from Yeats' &quot;To A Friend Whose Work Has Come To Nothing&quot; cross my mind, &quot;Be secret and exult.

(Mind you, I said I think).  The book is not a mere impressionistic pastiche (like Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence).  Mr. Gay is actually trying to say something.  The simplest way I can explain what that something is as I understand it is to write it out as succinctly as I know how:  The Romantic poets, especially Wordsworth and Shelley, their ascendency coinciding as it did with the ascendency of that new social class, the bourgeoisie, influenced society far more than is realized today...Shelley, for instance, whose name was considered unmentionable during his lifetime, became the model of what a poet should be by the end of the century, the ultra-respectable Robert Browning  one of his greatest fans.  All this fascination with the Romantics among the populace caused the society at large to look inward just when, paradoxically, vast strides were being made in what I guess we'll call the material instead of spiritual realm.-First off, I have to give my whole-hearted approval to the importance placed on Shelley as a cultural influence, just as Gay's Yale colleague Harold Bloom resurrected the importance of his literary influence.  Indeed, the two men are the only ones I know of to describe Dickens' work as more &quot;magical&quot; than &quot;realistic.&quot;-But Gay's writing and his tone are not pretty.  I mean, he seems to have some bile built up against the age he is describing.  Unlike Bloom, he seems pertly averse to the inward-directedness of the 19th century, and his writing on it frequently verges on mockery.  As he says (sneers) on page eight of the introduction, &quot;...what is the self that Victorian bourgeois seemed so intent on discovering and defining?&quot;-The Naked Heart?-The problems I have with this book are that a)There is a lack of urbanity or even drollery that leave one emotionally deflated after reading it; b)Gay never delves into what is wrong, per se, with what we nowadays call spiritual searching; c)Much of the writing is just plain bad-Perhaps Gay expects us to take from the book's title that something is seriously wrong with a society preoccupied with uncovering something so personal.-The book is confounding in all these respects.  Really, when it comes down to it Mr Gay seems to be saying (ever so subtly) that Victorian &quot;culture,&quot; as it were, was a sentimental waste of time.-You have to have grown pretty bald on the pate to write something so....heartless.per se, with what we nowadays call spiritual searching; c)Much of the writing is just plain bad-Perhaps Gay expects us to take from the book's title that something is seriously wrong with a society preoccupied with uncovering something so personal.-The book is confounding in all these respects.

Hence, (I think) the notes (which have raised so many pros and cons and head-scratchings among reviewers) tacked on at the end. He, sadly, was sinking fast and needed something to round out the book. The book, then, is not so much about the aborigines (which, as one reviewer has noted, it would be better to check out an Anthropolgy text on) as it is about the ailing Chatwin.-But who was Chatwin?  I think he was primarily a) an erudite hyper-aesthete (He started out working for museums); and b) an unflagging disciple of Heraclitus, the pre-Socratic philosopher whose most famous dictum was &quot;Everything is fire.&quot;  In other words, everything is in constant change. Everything is on the move.  Everything is being consumed and reborn. Whether it looks that way or not.  As the poet Delmore Schwartz put it, &quot;Time is the school in which we learn, that Time is the fire in which we burn.&quot;-This is why,I think the aborigines grabbed hold of his imagination at the end of his life, &quot;Aboriginals,in general, had the idea that all &quot;goods&quot; were potentialy malign and would work against their possessors unless they were forever in motion.&quot;  And, like Heraclitus, he inveighs against the members of his own race, &quot;The whites were forever changing the world to fit their doubtful vision of the future.&quot;-But what was Chatwin's vision of the future?  What did he expect to find out there in his dying days?-I think he gives the answer on page 293, the penultimate page of the book, where he writes, &quot;...the mystics believe the ideal man shall walk himself to a 'right death.'  He who has arrived 'goes back.' In Aboriginal Australia, there are specific rules for 'going back' or, rather, for singing your way to where you belong: to your 'conception site', to the place where your tjuringa is stored.  Only then can you become-or re-become-the Ancestor.  The concept is quite similar to Heraclitus's mysterious dictum,'Mortals and immortals, alive in their death, dead in each other's life.&quot;---I'm not at all sure exactly what this passage means. But the basic idea, I think, is that you keep moving down your songline or metaphysical groove or whatever until you die where you belong and thus rebegin a ghostly cycle of reincarnation.  Chatwin's tone in quoting the Aboriginal beliefs and Heraclitus give us no clue as to how much of this he actually believed...But we do know from his life that he was always walking, always searching up to the very end.-Reading the book with this knowledge lends to it (despite the jumble it is that caused my four star review) an almost heroic quality.-So read it and be inspired!e-become-the Ancestor.

Get over it.-This book definitely comes down on the playful (with a rapier wit) side than on the ominous tome side.-But here's what you do if you want a serious, comprehensive guide to every serious (or even not so serious) writer in the past half century: Go to the reference desk at your local library and ask the bespectacled fellow there to direct you to the TCLC (Twentieth Century Literary Criticism).  There, you will find, in somewhere around a hundred volumes, anything you want to know that's been said about your favorite author(s).-Didn't you guys learn all this in high school?.....Anyway, so the first reason to recommend this book is that it's fun and full of dash and likes to skewer where skewering is due...The SECOND REASON to buy this book is that, to my everlasting delight and surprise, it takes Tolkien seriously! It's wonderful to finally see one of the finest English stylists of the past half century as well as a cultural force beyond calculation taken seriously in a collection of modern reviews..  As Gary Kamiya proclaims, &quot;The philologist Tolkien (that dusty discipline's greatest gift to literature since Nietzsche) employs a superbly flexible style, moving from the vernacular to majestic King James cadences without ever sounding inflated or quaint.&quot;  And Michael Korda's, &quot;I cry every time I read the end.  What more can you ask from fiction?&quot; reaches a paragon of personal, heartfelt non-academic reviewing unmatched anywhere!-Ahem, you won't find anything like it in the TCLC.-Hmmmm, looking back over what I've just written, my review seems just as idiosyncratic as this book!....Good!	2001-02-07

Of course, this in not to do justice to Mr. Nicholl, whose meticulous research deserves high praise.-I personally am not enirely on the &quot;shallow&quot; Cadfael side or the meticulous research side.-I was hoping in this book to find a pleasant mixture of the two.-But when the author himself says &quot;But there is also a draining sense of the meaninglessness of it all.  This is the reductio ad absurdum of the intelligence world: self perpetuating, self referring.  They live in and by the confusion they create,&quot;p.255 I knew I'd bitten off more than I really wanted to chew.  But, out of a sense of justice or masochism or something, I went ahead and read the whole book.  If you want to know everything there is to know (or speculate about) Kit Marlowe<br />and his world, this is the book for you.  Much of this opus verges close to pure biography rather than mystery.  I guess what it comes down to is that I think Nicholl wanted to write a biography, but switched things around a bit so that it could come out under &quot;Mystery&quot; at the bookstores, thus increasing sales.  Well, yes, Marlowe's life is a &quot;mystery&quot; but so is yours and mine. After all, on the first page of the introduction, Nicholl avers &quot;...Yet these true things are only part of the story, pieces of a jigsaw.&quot;-And who could not say the same of their own lives as seen by others, or even by themselves?-Doesn't anyone read Proust anymore?!?-Alright. Enough. I just think that Nicholl has bitten a bit more than he can chew himself-As a delightful alternative to this genre of writing, I recommend &quot;Footsteps&quot; and &quot;Dr. Johnson and Mr. Savage&quot; by Richard Holmes:  The best books I've ever read in conjuring up writers lost in the mysterious past!-Despite all this, Nicholl has earned his four stars with his excellent writing and meticulous research.  I'm sure there are readers who appreciate it fully (professors and dons I betcha!)-Anyway, I think I'm coming close to being hypocritical in this long-winded review!-Cheerio!he mysterious past!-Despite all this, Nicholl has earned his four stars with his excellent writing and meticulous research.

This book, even though you're (probably) not in Ireland when you read it, will have you responding much as Frost did.  The peasantry have so much of their pagan ancestry in their blood that, despite their ostensible Catholicism, their deep belief in &quot;the little people&quot; comes out as strong as ever when questioned about it.  Reading these anecdotes, some of them grafted directly onto Yeats' early poetry, gives them a power they would not have had you not read this book and realized how &quot;here and now&quot; faeryland was to the common people at the time.  The Celtic belief that death (into Faeryland)is far more desirable than birth is made beautifully apparent in this book.  Hence, by the way, the celebratory Irish wake.  Hence also this lovely poem<br />Heardst thou not sweet words among That Heaven-resounding minstrelsy? Heardst thou not that those who die Awake in a world of ecstacy? That love, when limbs are interwoven, And sleep when the night of life is cloven, And thought, to the world's dim boudaries clinging, And music, when one beloved is singing, Is death?<br />These sorts of things, as well as Yeats' poetry, are worth deep consideration in this present world where medicine is deemed omnipotent...and yet, nevertheless, we all die.	2001-01-28

It means that those &quot;adapted to existing conditions survive.&quot;  In other words, a grizzly bear may be terribly strong, but he would die in equatorial regions where weaker, but more adapted, creatures survive.-Further, Bannister shows through thoroughgoing research that the term &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; did not even come into vogue until the 1940's, not, as most of us were led to believe, in the late 19th century.  In fact, Bannister, in searching for references to those Social Darwinists he and I and probably you were so familiar with through History books, &quot;came close to concluding that someone had made the whole thing up.&quot;  Furthermore, the seldom times the term is used in the late 19th century, it is always pejorative and used to castigate someone ELSE who had a &quot;Nature red and tooth and claw&quot; perspective on human beings.  In other words, proclaiming one's self a Social Darwinist in the late 19th century would be the equivilant of proclaimimg one's self a Nazi today...Remember, it was the Victorian age.-The reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of the superlative 5 is because he gives short shrift to Nietzsche in his chapter on him.  While mentioning that there were thinkers that did not equate Nietzsche with Social Darwinism, he doesn't dwell on them or give their arguments.  Instead, he dwells on those who equate Nietzsche with the most extreme form of Social Darwinism...Anyone who has read Nietzsche in detail realizes that this is far from the case.  Simplification of Nietzsche abounds in almost all scholarly works not concentrated on him. Unfortunately, Bannister's is no exception.-But, aside from this scholarly neglect, the book was an eye-opener, debunking most of what I thought of the history of Social Darwinism.-Give it a read.rwinism...Anyone who has read Nietzsche in detail realizes that this is far from the case.

In particular, of course we all know from Freud that we're all obsessed with sex.  But the double standard in Arab culture was truly amazing as revealed throughout the book, particularly in the passage where an Arab, in the most vulgar terms, talks to Theroux about procuring foreign women.  And, Theroux, finally fed up with his harangue tells the Arab man he has just the kind of women the women he wants....and they are Arab.  The man never spoke to Theroux again.-The best part of the book is in Chapter 9 where he parodies ignorant visiting reporters' accounts of Saudi Arabia as if an Arab had come to report on New York City: I'll just quote a few lines from it &quot;Lucy Ricardo might not recognize New York today....Business fluorishes with the intersection of Broadway(&quot;broad&quot; signifying impure woman).(and 42nd)  This district is known as Times Square, after the Jewish-owned New York Times newspaper.

The reason I'm only giving the book four stars is that it seems to me that Theroux can't decide whether he's reporting or writing a personal journal.  He's obviously doing both.  But this combination leads to some awkward transitions and not too swell writing at times.  Personally, I think he should stick exclusively to the autobiographical.  It's much more interesting and, in the end, tells us much more about the author AND about Saudi Arabia than mere reporting.	2001-01-25

This is the book for you if you're interested in: a)The difficulty of learning to fish in different ways off the Japanese coast, in detail. b)What it might have been like for a young boy growing up in a poor Japanese village a long time ago. c) What the effects of smallpox are like.-It really reads like a non-fiction work, not a fantastic haunting or Gothic novel, best exemplified by the Brontes, particularly Emily's Wuthering Heights.  Nothing in the book evokes passion or is really more than commonplace.  The practice of lighting fires to attract ships to founder on reefs in order to pillage them was a common practice around the globe, particularly in England.  Young boys growing up frequently have a hard time of it (whether in Japan or Nigeria), and I reommend a medical textbook to get a better idea of smallpox, its etiology and symptomotology.  Why did this book get all these reviews praising it as &quot;haunted&quot; and &quot;Gothic.&quot;  There's nothing haunted or Gothic in a tale a young boy growing up in a poor fishing village where they cause ships to wreck in order to sustain themselves and then accidentally catch smallpox on one of these ventures.  Did Yoshimura bribe everybody?  Is it taboo for us to give a Japanese novel translated into English anything other than superlative reviews because of the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II?-Why is everybody giving this bland book such stellar reviews?-That's the truly haunting question about this book.	2001-01-24

I knew Dickey from 1991 until his death, and thus my opinion of him must be biased in some way, though I'm not sure in which direction, if any.  I simply consider him now, after his death, as I did before our meeting in 1991 and our many phone conversations following our meeting, as the last great poet in America. Hart has done a good job of editing and my hat, if I had one on at the moment, would be off to him.-I don't want to belabor the point.  Either you get great poetry or you don't.  Hart's selection of the best of Dickey's poetry is exquisite.  In particular, &quot;The Sheep Child&quot; a poem written from the perspective of the few seconds of life of a product of bestiality is what Dickey is all about:<br />&quot;...In the summer sun of the hillside, with my eyes Far more than human.  I saw for a blazing moment The great grassy world from both sides, Man and beast in the round of their need,<br />And the hill wind stirred in my wool, My hoof and my hand clasped each other, I ate my one meal Of milk, and died Staring.  From dark grass I came straight.....&quot;<br />This is Dickey at his best, in perfect tune with the wondrous and terrible insights combined with the visionary traumas of what we call &quot;Nature,&quot; but which we are tremblingly unsure about, just like the sheep child in his (her?) moment of existence.<br />A must for lovers of true poetry.-A rarity in these days.	2001-01-23

He had just lived through the bloodfest known as the English Civil War in which many of his friends were horribly slaughtered because of their religious beliefs.  His whole point in writing this book was to advance arguments that one should not go to war over differences in religion.  His controversial alternative is absolute obedience to the state and secular authorities.  This alternative combined with the quote, noted above, so maddeningly and frequently taken out of context, have given Hobbes and his work the undeserved reputation as, well, curmudgeonly.  One might ask what sort of book you might write if you had just witnessed the horrific slaughter and loss of esteemed friends that Hobbes had.  You would probably write a book urging peace at any price even if it meant undue subjugation to the state at times.  This is exactly what Hobbes did.-Hobbes belongs to that majestic, good-natured and unflappable tradition of brilliant English heretical political and religious writers including, among others, David Hume (well, Scottish too) and Bertrand Russell who seemed merely humored by the ecclesiastics calling down hell-fire upon them and similar dire threats from men in power.  Scholars are STILL trying to debunk the work of these prominent men, among others more obscure, with little success it must be said.- Yes, the prose can be rough-going at times.  But if you want an argument against war, specifically war over religion.  This is the masterpiece to set your nose to.  Once you've finished, it's hard not to smile when you think of Hobbes and his essential decency amidst the turbulent times in which he lived.piece to set your nose to.

Not that there is intrinsically wrong in this, but....Caveat Lector.  Just why Bloom developed such a deeply engrained animus to the modern age is impossible to tell and the biographies that are sure to come out in the near future (I don't consider Ravelstein a biography in any sense of the word.  Saul Bellow has axes to grind too.) will be interesting reads.-The basic problem I have with the book is this: The type of deep spiritual (Romantic, with a capital R) love that Bloom regards as lost in our society has always been rare.  It has been confined to those who have had a cultured upbringing combined with an inborn sensitivity and spirituality.  What has happened in our demotic age is that, as Bloom perfectly puts it, &quot;Sure, you can be a romantic today if you so choose, but it is a little like being a virgin in a whorehouse.  It just doesn't fit with the temper of the times and gets no support in the current atmosphere.&quot; So what? It's still Romantic love.  And our age is not alone in this temper.  In more or less all ages, the vast majority of the people have regarded this type of love as, well, &quot;silly and immature.&quot;  Bloom himself admits this in the chapter on Stendhal where he states, &quot;Stendhal appears unable to depict a fully ripe man.  Successful maturity is doubtful for him, and he may in this reflect a problem with the Romantic mood altogether.&quot;  The most clear passage in the book, the one that comes closest to hitting at what Bloom's all about here comes in the chapter on Anna Karenina where Bloom says,&quot;...there is an alien impression...of a gracious, semi-aristocratic civility that is now so far away from anything we can experience or hope to experience in our daily lives.  The  relationships of love and friendship have a delicacy and involvement with higher concerns that almost seem inauthentic.  Rather than a model for our own lives, the social scene seems to be reminiscent of a lost world where people had the leisure to attempt to make works of art of their lives.&quot;  It is this &quot;lost world&quot; that Bloom hungers for.  In other words, Bloom wants us to go back to Queen Victoria and the following Belle Epoque, when the focus of society's lens was on these priveleged few.  It is curious that Bloom chooses this attack on the modern world from a book in which the heroine commits suicide by laying herself in the path of an oncoming train bacause of that society's narrow conventions.-But, please don't get me wrong. I actually LIKE this book because it focuses on the most important things in life: spiritual love and friendship.  It's just that Bloom expects too much and has somehow deluded himself into thinking that there was a Golden Age when it was the norm.  It has always ben rare, and I don't see why Bloom is such a sourpuss about it.  One gets the feeling that some deep hurt has been done to him, and now is the time for vindication.  For some reason, Bloom wants us to believe that spiritual love is extinct when it is merely out of the limelight, where it is actually more authentic.  After all, the most common adjective associated with the Victorian age is &quot;hypocritical.&quot; -But the book is interesting, erudite and worth the read.

To wit, &quot;Why did he stop writing?&quot;-But the book is a well-researched and well-written account of Rimmbaud as &quot;un autre,&quot; somebody else than a poet...But it's all so grindingly depressing.  Yes, Rimbaud had incredible endurance and will and courage.  But he had no business acumen as the accounts of his many endeavors in the world of commerce amply illustrate.  The book is essentially a tale of his slow degeneration in body, if not spirit.-I used to have a friend who loved Rimbaud more than I do who would call me in the middle of the night drunkenly, tearfully asking me why he quit.  Well, there was nothing I could say at 3 A. M. that he would remember the next morning.-But what I feel is that the answer lies in Rimbaud's most famous poem, &quot;Le Bateau Ivre.&quot;  At the end of the poem, he says that, after all the exhilarating and mystical insights, after all the rapturous visions amidst the mad seastorms, there is nothing he would like better now then to return to being a litle boat being pushed across a placid pond by a little boy.  Rimbaud had been through more hell in his life by the end of his teens than would fit in the lives of many a tortured soul.-It's really not so remarkable when you consider it that, his poetry unrecognized, his soul tortured by the relationship with Verlaine and the other atrocities and privations he endured that the young man would flee the literary world that had given him nothing but anguish in the end.-Unfortunately , the world to which he fled offered little in the way of compensation, as this book sadly chronicles.  I recommend this book to those who, like myself, had no clear idea of exactly what Rimbaud DID after he stopped writing besides vague ideas of his being a gun-runner, slave-trader and amputee (This book, by the way, casts serious doubts over whether he was ever either of the former two, except perhaps when forced to do so by bad luck and necessity).-So, all in all, a sad but informative work.-I still think the last lines of &quot;Le Bateau Ivre&quot; are the key to why he stopped writing.  But, as is commmonplace, you can't go home again, as those last lines express a yearning for.

These Romans didn't go for redundant verbiage.  A curious parallel in English is, of course, Ernest Hemingway.-His laudatory description of Agricola interlaced with philosophy is superb. My favorite quote is, &quot;...he always remembered the hardest lesson that philosophy teaches-a sense of proportion.&quot;  The same can be said of Tacitus and his prose-I found the section on Germania a bit less interesting because, well, that sort of anthropology just doesn't flow as well with Tacitus' terse prose. I was reminded of Caesar and his description of the Gauls. This discrepancy can't really be helped of course, and &quot;anthropology,&quot; as such, didn't exist at the time.- It was interesting to note the esteem in which the Germans held their women.  I suppose my disappontment stems from the modern approach to the analysis of societes and their psychology.  But Tacitus' unvarying faithfulness to the facts as he knows them without the vagaries of, say, the fantastical accounts of Herodotus is refreshing, and, to use a word currently fallen into disrepute, courageously manly.-A must read for history buffs and those interested in Latin prose without a thorough schooling in Latin itself.  I haven't seen the original Latin of Tacitus, but the style as here translated is nearly equivalent to that of Caesar's Letters which I translated in my second of four years of Latin in high school.-In any case, you don't have much to lose.  You can finish it in a sunny afternoon.	2001-01-17

I mean, it's very interesting to read about these obscure figures whom Barzun feels that history has neglected, and other obscurities and eccentricities which one cannot help but feel Barzun took an impish delight in including.-But, all in all, the book is more kitschy than &quot;Great.&quot;-Barzun leapfrogs from period to period seemingly at will with little or no sense of continuity, the spelling and grammatical mistakes abound (as noted by other acute reviewers) and those little side notes are also ENTERTAINING but NOT history.-I kept on getting the feeling I was reading &quot;The Rime of The Ancient Mariner.&quot;-Barzun is no fool.  He is an erudite and cultured man, and shrewd.  He knows what sells books in this &quot;decadent&quot; culture.  He has succeeded in doing so with this one.  This book is essentially bubblegum, anecdotal history.  But there's nothing wrong with this type of narrative.  It's just not the real thing, as so many of you reviewers seem to feel.  Before you burn me at the stake, just take a look at Gibbon's Decline and Fall, Hume's History of England, or Churchill's History of the English Speaking Peoples to get an idea of what thorough, narrative history is all about.  Then you can go ahead and burn me!-And as far as Barzun's ultimate verdict on our age as demotic, I think he's perfectly correct.  But I think he should have stuck with &quot;demotic&quot; rather than &quot;decadent&quot; because, even in Barzun's work, the word has too many connotations.-What this demotic age signals (among a host of other things Barzun is not shy about elaborating, in terrible prose) is that &quot;the demand for genius has died out.&quot;  Barzun's work is evidence of this!  History for pop culture has never been so perfectly exemplified! -But, as I said, the book is fun and innocuous until the absurd end where he plays the millenium card, and unoubtedly sells googles of more books.-In his passage on the obscure Saint-Evremond, Barzun writes, &quot;If the past could really be described as it felt when it was the present, it would show a large gathering of persons like Saint-Evremond, their contemporary admirers sure that here were the classics of the age and unable to believe that a later time would not even recognize the names.&quot;-Add Barzun and his worshipers to the crowd!orating, in terrible prose) is that &quot;the demand for genius has died out.&quot;  Barzun's work is evidence of this!

Although a firm believer in Christianity, his is not the sort of Christianity that is comfortable with the world God has made.  He is more a believer, one might say, in the Fall, and longs for the angelic world which he catches glimpses of from time to time.  This selection of poems is an excellent introduction to his disposition, which deal more with escaping this world than glorifying the next.  Brief Examples: In &quot;Child-hood&quot; his love of that innocent period &quot;which angels guard&quot; and the impossibility of returning to that state of bliss make him ask himself &quot;Why if I see a rock or shelf, Shall I thence cast myself down&quot; ....&quot;Since all that age doth teach, is ill&quot;----And in &quot;The Night,&quot; he speculates that there is in God &quot;a deep, but dazzling darkness;&quot; and proclaims &quot;O for that night! where I in him/ Might live invisible and dim.&quot;-Vaughan was really ahead of his time and more resembles Shelley and his later disciple Francis Thompson than any poet of his age (including George Herbert).  After reading this selection of poems, one feels that Vaughan was a unique sort of Christian. More to the point, one questions whether Christianity was not the mere medium through which Vaughan, in tune with his age, conveyed his mystical yearning and escapism, which is the core of his poetry and his being.	2001-01-15

I found it still holds up as a fine piece of literature as well as an inspiring example of personal courage.  As another reader has pointed out, Camus was ostracized, more or less, by the French literary establishment after the book's publication.  I still find the chapter on metaphysical rebellion the best.  Camus has a fine understanding of the English Romantic poets and what, for many, their rebellion consisted of: &quot;The Byronic hero, incapable of love, or capable only of an impossible love, suffers endlessly.  He is solitary, languid, his condition exhausts him.  If he wants to feel alive, it must be in the terrible exaltation of a brief and destructive action.  To love someone whom one will never see again is to give a cry of exultation as one perishes in the flames of passion.  One lives only in and for the moment, in order to achieve 'the brief and vivid union of a tempestuous heart united to the tempest'(Lermentov)&quot;  This is as an acute a dissection of the raison d'etre of the &quot;Byronic hero&quot; as I've read in any English criticism (and believe me, I've read a lot!).  The passages on Nietzsche are also exquisite.  He gets to the root of many of the great thinker's ideas by quoting the lines that come from the heart: &quot;the most painful, the most heartbreaking question, that of the heart that asks itself: where can I feel at home?&quot;-The passages on Milton are exquisite as well.-The whole book is a well-rounded philosophical enterprise that touches both the heart and the mind.  This is not sentimentality, as one reviewer contends (such criticisms usually come from those jaded souls who have had their hearts burnt out in grad school).  It is decency...unshakable decency, according to the review by the Atlantic on the back cover of my edition.

His first published work was a collection of verse entitled The Marble Faun.  His failure as a poet outright may help explain why his prose is so turgid, convoluted but also profound and insightful beyond MERE prose.  It's as if he's trying to correct his initial failure as intensely as posible.  In the process of doing so, he became one of the gratest novelists in 20th Century American Literature. (Second only to Thomas Wolfe in my opinion.)-I guess the reason I like this book less than the aforementioned Faulkner works is the same reason most of the other reviewers like it more: It doesn't have enough of that turgid, mystical omniscient kaleidoscopic introspective prose that make the other novels so brilliant; But also, I admit, harder to plough through for a beginner.-Here's an example of what I'm talking about: Joe Christmas is observing his mistress in the daylight, &quot;Meanwhile he could see her from a distance now and then in the daytime, about the rear premises, where moved articulate beneath the clean, austere garments that she wore that rotten richness ready to flow into putrefaction at a touch,like something growing in a swamp, not once looking toward the cabin or toward him. And when he thought of that other personality that seemed to exist somewhere in the darkness itself, it seemed to him that what he saw now by daylight was a phantom of someone whom the night sister had murdered and which now moved purposeless about the scenes of old peace, robbed even of the power of lamenting.&quot;-It's this eerie poetic perspctive that make Faulkner not just any writer, but a great one. It captures how fleeting identity and, indeed, life is. His language can make the characters vacillate between flesh-and-blood and psychopathic visions at the stroke of a pen.  If you're new to Faulkner, read As I Lay Dying next and his perturbing magic will continue to grow on you.  Perhaps, &quot;like something growing in a swamp.&quot;-rare, foreboding, and to be approached circuitously, lest you slip into murky depths!at the stroke of a pen.

I'm not that particularly fond of his painstaking mammoth biographies of Shelley and Coleridge because, well, they're too run-of-the-mill and not all that much fun to read.-In other words, just the opposite of books like this one.  This type of book, where the relationship between Holmes and the author he is writing about is constantly in play add a mystery and a haunted quality inherent in the time elapsed between Holmes' time and the author's that keeps the readers attention constantly transfixed (or, at least, this reader's).  As Holmes himself puts it, &quot;The material surfaces of life are continually breaking down, sloughing off, changing, almost as fast as human skin.&quot;  Examples: The passage on Shelley's view of the double, the &quot;ghost of the living person&quot; the view of which signified the shadow world invading this one; Shelley's view that this is what was happening to him just before he drowned himself is the most affecting passage I've read on Shelley's end, and together with the photograph of the Casa Magni, which I'd never actually seen, and whose setting Mary Shelley said caused them to be in touch with the unreal sent shivers up my spine.  It's not to be missed.-The section on Nerval was also interesting, as were the others.  Curiously, the same sort of thing seems to have affected Nerval &quot;...Here began for me what I shall call the overflowing of dreams into real life.&quot;  Both sections are excellent and Holmes' speculation that &quot;Nerval's whole work was a form of suicide note&quot; seems right on the mark.  The other sections are intriguing as well, but these two haunted me the most.  In a moment of brave self-exposure where Holmes is following Shelley's footsteps in Rome, he recounts a dinner where they toasted Shelley as a fellow-exile and his name &quot;rang to the roof.&quot;  Holmes writes, &quot;I sat there looking at my plate dangerously close to tears.  I...determined to write a book for people like them too, who would never read it, people who have lost most things except hope.&quot;-You've succeeded Mr Holmes...determined to write a book for people like them too, who would never read it, people who have lost most things except hope.&quot;-You've succeeded Mr Holmes.	2001-01-12

What the author eventually advances (after ploughing through many other concepts and alternative explanations) is something called &quot;advanced action theory.&quot;  This theory entails, as far as I can make out, very simply, that there is a &quot;common future&quot; as well a &quot;common past&quot; that influences what we call the present but that we are unable to perceive this common future because our nature as AGENTS (he uses this term over and over)precludes us from perceiving this common future.-I kept on thinking of a spatial analogy of a person tied to the back of the caboose of a train facing backward.  He can see where the train has gone, but not the vista ahead, which is certainly just as real. But if he has been in this position his entire life, he would have no idea what you meant by saying &quot;See that mountain up ahead!&quot; How could you know? It's as if one of us were to state, &quot;See that assassination attempt tomorrow!&quot;- Archimedes' Point for Mr. Price would entail an observer standing by as the train passes observing both where it's been and where it's going.-This is the simplest way I know to explain what this book is about, though it may just make more of a muddle of things for all I know....But the physicists Mr. Price describes seem to have done a pretty good job of that already.-Anyhow, that's enough explanation for a review like this one.

(And being henceforth rebuked by a guard for doing so in what was, after all, a penal institution.)-The other reviewers are pretty much on the mark in that Strachey set a new standard for biography.-But the piece on General Gordon surpasses all. I can see myself on death row laughing over this section.-It is in part a sad reflection on what years in the Sudan can do to an orthodox Englishman's mind.  It is indeed uncanny to hear Gordon aver, on his famous expedition to save Khartoum, nearly the exact words of Baudelaire as he gazed across the perhaps too familiar desert landscape:&quot;It is necessary to be drunken always.  This is everything. This is the unique question.&quot; (my translation)-This is the aged General the sober English sent on this perilous quest.  This is the man who daily battled with the question of what God's Will was for him.-What the Gordon section and the others show, of course, is that man (or woman) is not one-dimensional.  Far more often, he(she)is multi-dimensional to the point of being paradoxical.  The hypocritical Victorian mindset was pushed over the edge by this book.	2001-01-09

Another (obvious) reason is that critics, such as Edmund Wilson, simply don't like Tolkien and would like him permanently relegated to the realm of childhood literature.-This thin book of verse,in its spare sixteen poems, is evidence to the contrary.  They owe a great deal to Shelley (whom many would also like to relegate to some not quite Literary with a capital &quot;L&quot; realm.) -In fact, parts of &quot;The Sea Bell,&quot; by far the best poem in the book, can almost be transliterated line-by-line from a stanza in Shelley's &quot;The Revolt of Islam.&quot; -To give an idea of the piquancy of the book's best poems, the last poem in this little book (not inappropriately titled &quot;The Last Ship&quot;) concerns a fair maiden wishing to escape the bonds of mortality in an Elven boat passing in the early morning: &quot;A sudden music came to her came, as she stood there gleaming.&quot;  But, alas, of course,though she dares one step, her mortality bars her from such an escape, &quot;...then deep in clay her feet sank and she halted staring.&quot;-Exquisite. Aside from the sheer beauty of such poems, there are obviously deeper themes here than those to be found in nursery rhymes.

You have made a fine-toothed culling of all that is most sublime in Thoreau's Journals and closest to the spirit of Walden.  That is to say, you have spirited out the passages which capture Thoreau's Transcendental other-worldliness and (paradoxically) love of the natural world at the same time.-Thoreau was so enraptured with Time that I'm surprised that more comparisons with Proust have not been made.  I suppose it's the difference between the men and their modes of expression.  But for Thoreau, as for Proust, we live in a mysterious whirlwind transporting us from one &quot;self&quot; to another with the speed of a Concorde.  We live, of course, in Time.-My favorite entry is &quot;November Thoughts&quot; in which Thoreau reflects upon travel: &quot;It was as if I was promised the greatest novelty the world has ever seen or shall see, though the utmost possible novelty would be the difference between me and myself a year ago...And yet there is no more tempting novelty than this new November.  No going to Europe or another world to be named with it....Think of the consumate folly of attempting to go away from here!  When the constant endeavor should be to get nearer and nearer here.&quot;-We, in this ever so fleeting life, are transiting from self to self in the dimension of time at a speed that dwarfs anything available in the other dimensions and which, moreover, is more wondrous and even terrifying when we consider its implications. - Perhaps this is why we turn a blind eye to it and go gadding about all over.-  Thoreau was especially attuned to this form of travel, as Emerson said at his elegy he had a &quot;sixth sense&quot; for such things.  This selection is a MUST for all Thoreauvians.  It is laced with such insights of which I have only been able to cover this one.	2001-01-07

Unfortunately, and I mean this with no animus, one wonders just how significant it has been.  The encounter with Maugham is unenlightening,banal and centerpieced by a full page photograph of a note from Maugham to Costa stating &quot;For Richard Costa in recollection of a pleasant chat.&quot; (Signed of course.)-Gee, I feel I know Maugham so much better now.-The Maugham part is only the first 32 pages though.  The rest of the book is a concoction gleaned from the author's life of unrelated literary notions and meetings:H.G. Wells, Ms. Hemingway, Edmund Wilson etc. -The only of these encounters I found truly amusing and interesting was with the hysterical late wife of the writer Malcolm Lowry.  She is already smashed by the time Costa meets her in mid-afternoon and, after a lunch of escargots, for which she has Costa pay, takes him back to her hotel room, where she continues to drink and leaves Costa fascinated by the welts on her back (Were they intended? Does she have violent lovers?)-Costa leaves her hotel room drunkenly as her late husband was famous for being (being bit by a poodle on the way out), thinking he has managed a sort of coup in getting her to admit that Malcolm had intended suicide.-It's, of course, really not such a surprise after all for anyone who knows anything about Malcolm....So, in summation, an interesting enough read.  Mr. Costa has made some interesting acquaintances along the way....Still, for me, the whole book is worth the picture of Malc and Marge outside their cabin in Canada with drinks in their hands-Malc grinning like the cat that swallowed the canary!	2001-01-06

YES, THIS BIOGRAPHY OF COLERIDGE IS MAGISTERIAL! It's right up there with Gibbon and Johnson.  All we reviewers agree upon this point.  And I'm sure it will cement Holmes' name in the annals of academia 'til the blowing of the trumpet of the Lord and the end of time altogether....And,no doubt, a man of Holmes' talent has every right to be as magisterial as he likes, in order that these things may come to pass....But, as Holmes well knows, one reads for other things aside from being assured that what he is reading is being cast in marble for all posterity.  His books on Shelley (Footsteps) and Johnson and Savage are evidence of this knowledge. Readers read to be carried away to a different time and place where seemingly magical things actually happened, &quot;Did you see Shelley plain?..&quot; (apologies to R.B.)  In these former books, Holmes does just that and creates an enjoyable read which produces more of a communion with the author in question than many a heavy tome....Any of us who have studied English Literature know the basic facts of Coleridge's life:But here they are again with all sorts of minutiae and dates and maps and God knows whatnot.  But I don't feel that much closer to the author the way I did, for instance after reading Holmes' book on Johnson and Savage...The only section that grabbed my attention was the lectures on Hamlet, which truly were just as much about Coleridge's conviction of the play's Platonic essence as it was about Coleridge himself, and his own Platonic insights.  And I think Coleridge was right, by the way.  You can't give a magisterial volume any less than 4 stars.  But, Mr. Holmes, when you finish all this up, howsbout coming back and writing those other type of books that give us a good read, stimulate our sense of the mystery of the author's times and truly strengthen our mystical bond with him?...	2001-01-04

I just finished reading too many reviews that sounded like Keanu Reeves monotoning, &quot;Yo man, like,this book was a total downer.  Go catch some waves instead.&quot; But, as they say, it's a free country and, if you want to make fools of yourselves, who am I really to stand in your way?<br />  Hardy was a great lover of the poet Shelley.  In fact, after Jude the obscure, he devoted the rest of his life to writing poetry based on his poetic model. In this book there are so many references (for those familiar with Shelley's poem Epipsychidion), and even one whole page particularly referencing the poem by name and giving quotes from it, that I was astounded that nobody even mentioned it.  I just figured that it was you numbskull AP students again (sorry, guys, hang in there), but then I thought back to MY AP teacher and reconsidered.  Even she would not have picked up on it. &quot;Epipsychidion,&quot; in Greek, means &quot;soulmate.&quot;  It was one of Shelley's last poems before he committed suicide by drowning at the age of 30. I could cite several examples of it in Hardy's novel, but the last few paragraphs of the fifth section of the &quot;At Shaston&quot; chapter where the poem is mentioned by name and several lines from it are quoted will suffice.  This book is really Shelley's poem in novelistic form.  As such, it is to be praised mightily.  &quot;Epipsychidion&quot; is essentially the story (though the narrative breaks down in parts) of the poet seeking his heavenly vision of love here on terra firma: To find that vision in Earthly form.  What greater meaning on Earth is there (Shelley and Hardy would ask)?  There are moments (fleeting) when Jude and his new love do seem to achieve this happiness envied by the gods.  But all too soon they are thrown into despair, their dreams lieing in tatters around them, shattered by the conventions and prejudices of the world.  Shelley's poem was never finished.  His drowning of himself got in the way.....So what are we to gather from all this failed love, cruelty, murder,suicide and misery....THIS, that the world is a terribly unkind place for intellectual visionaries.  They are the best and the brightest among us and their visions are REAL, the most beautiful things we can experience. But their attempts to implement them repeatedly result in cruel failure.

It's not Moby Dick.  It's not Conrad Aiken's Blue Voyage.  It's not Richard Dana's Two Years Before The Mast.-What it is is a simple man's account of his daring trek around the world through many a life-threatening situation.  What makes this short little book a good read is its to-the-point account of what he's up to.  The only work of literature it reminds me of at points, oddly enough, is Thoreau's Walden, with that particularity in regards to detail: to times of day, expenses etc.  But, of course, there are none of Thoreau's deep reflections of time and man's relation to Nature etc-But I don't think the lovers of this book are into that kind of thing anyway-What they want is sort of non-fiction Robert Louis Stevenson stuff-Oh well, I've never understood why Moby Dick is considered so great anyway: more of an encyclopedia on cetology than a novel as far as I can tell.-So, if you're into a non-sophisticated tale of one man's sea adventure, follow Slocum and hurry back to the sloop to forget yourself again in the voyage.	2001-01-02

In it, Bloom effectively disemboweled and laid to rest the dried up &quot;New Criticism&quot; and &quot;Neo-Classicism&quot; that was in the ascendant at the time.  He did no less than knock T.S. Eliot off his critical pedestal: a dragon-slayer indeed!  The Visionary Company took its title  from a line in a Yeats' poem  referring to several poets (some, like Lionel Johnson, of exquisite merit) who shunned material success and followed their own visionary and masterful style of poetry and ended up dying young, drunk and destitute. (L. Johnson, for example was such a classical languages genius that he was offered a position at Oxford when he was barely over 20!  Instead, he decided to pen his masterful poetry while drinking himself to death.  He died after falling off a barstool at around the age of 30).- The full line from the Yeats' poem is &quot;I would be one with the visionary company.&quot;-But the reader will take note that neither Yeats nor Bloom consumed himself with his genius in such a way.  This, in Bloom's case, is somewhat unfortunate (I'm not going to delve into Yeats here.). After The Visionary Company, his prolific works can be graphed onto a parabolic downward swoop ending with this book...In the middle of said swoop, you can find works such as The Western Canon which, while idiosyncratic and a touch pompous and presumptuous(understatement?), still makes one catch one's breath at times at the profundity of the insights contained therein....But OK, first of all, Omens of Millenium is not truly Bloom's book at all, but a kitschy rip-off of The Gnostic Religion by Hans Jonas (Note how many times Jonas is mentioned in Bloom's book.).  The problem is that Jonas was a painstaking scholar and wrote as such, and most readers will find him inaccessible to some extent, just as some readers found The Visionary Company.  SOOO, Bloom solves everything by writing this nice little book relating Gnosticism to Western  literature...Right?....Wrong!!...Bloom himself is guilty of what he dismisses the New Agers and such for: ill-informed boot-licking of the mass culture's obsession with all sorts of ridiculous things.-Sorry Harold, if you can't take it, don't dish it out.-My advice to readers is just to go back and read any of the great Romantic poets.  They and the Gnostics are essentially the same on a spiritual level, and the writings of the poets are much more beautiful.-But please go ahead and check out Hans Jonas if you really are interested in the historical and technical aspects of this fascinating worldview.ionary Company.

But the two are so hard to separate!-Basically, Russell believes that mysticism &quot;is the inspirer of what is best in man.&quot;  But that it is absolutely muddle-headed and has lead mankind down numerous philosophic blind alleys in the past thousand or so years  (I think anyone who has read Kant or Hegel can't help but come to this conclusion).-University professors (especially those of Philosophy) are excepted from the previous parenthetical remark! -But I don't guess Russell (a Nobel prize winner in literature, by the way) matters so much anymore: This book I'm reviewing is out of print, nobody else has reviewed it and I haven't heard his name mentioned in highbrow discussions for many a year.  He was a mathematical genius, wrote prose that could cut like a razor blade concerning the most abstruse subjects in a manner understandable to most laymen, and was a profound skeptic in re matters religious.  This latter got him into all kinds of trouble with women's societies and the like back in the earlier part of the century and actually got him fired from the City College of New York. So he packed his bags and went to teach at Harvard.-You see, he was a British aristocrat (an Earl) and all this rabble rousing by the hoi polloi was really a non-issue for him.  In his autobiography, he recounts how his mother always told him, &quot;Never follow a crowd to do Evil.&quot;  Russell never followed a crowd to do anything!-All this biographical elaboration is to help readers understand the man who wrote this book which, in a nutshell, praises the mystical impulse in its pure, unadulterated form while deploring the aforementioned philosophical muddles to which it leads, and, on the other hand, glorifies (justly) the English schools of empirical logic and the scientific progress to which they have lead.  One can hardly look at this computer screen and deny this claim.  All this in a lucid and thoroughly enjoyable prose.  Yes, Russell has seen his days of celebrity come and go (as well as his days in general, one might add,) but if you chance by a wizened looking professor loaded down with heavyweight tomes on metaphysical systems, you might get a rather surprising response if you mention Bertie Russell. - In his day, Russell was the Mick Jagger of Philosophy, and coeds used to quarrel over who got to bed down with him that night when he came to lecture that the stuff a good proportion of their professors were teaching was, quite literally, nonsense.-And just think, he got away with it all!

In my opinion, of course, he ALREADY is the only one of them with a mote of talent.  And what a talent it is!!-His style is original and inimitable.  His writings convey a feeling totally unlike any other writer's....But what is it?  The paradox is that since it's so original and unlike anything else, it's difficult to find words and comparisons to convey to the would-be reader why to buy this book.  Almost all the reviews aver that Bowles' characters are defined by place.  This is eminently the case.  In fact, one might say that his characters are SO defined by place that they aren't really &quot;characters&quot; at all, but mere functions of the universes they find themselves in (rather harsh and bleak ones, to understate things a bit). -Reading these stories, you actually begin to lose a sense of self: YOUR self.  That's how powerful Bowles' writing is.  What you are left with is, of course, a hollowness, on the one hand, in finding that you have lost your sense of identity.  But you have gained something: a lost wonder, beautiful and terrifying, of what existence, after all, is, that captures something of what a child feels at times.  But the comparison with a child's view is to simplify things enormously.  What you really gain, to put things perhaps a bit awkwardly, is the terror and wonder of being alive.  The Greeks had a word for this feeling, Deinos.  We don't have such a word, a word that so effectively combines the feelings of terror and wonder. - It's where we get the word dinosaur from, if that helps any.-But this may be beside the point.

Most all the reviewers have mentioned what a great first history this is that we know of, and have excused Herodotus' entertaining and bizarre digressions, proclaimed that he was more readable than Thucydides etc etc.-All this is good and well, and I'll go along with just about all of it without too many a qualm (though I do protest in re Thucydides, esp. The Landmark Edition)-But I have a rather different take than most reviewers on what is significant in this work.-Or maybe it's just that I review things differently: I look for SPECIFICS, in this case just a few paragraphs, that encapsulate why this book is more than just the convoluted ramblings of an eccentric about things he obviously didn't know too much about-To write a history like this one, with all its foibles, requires a distinctly human awareness of the passage of time.  That's really what makes this book great.  It's the first evidence we have of a consciousness of that sort put forth in an extensive narrative form, that unique awareness of time and mortality that makes us human.  This is why the cruel Xerxes is actually my favorite character in the book, despite his barbarity (burying men alive as sacrifices to the Earth god) or silliness (attempting to punish the sea for not being favorable to his expedition).-This is why: When Xerxes saw the whole Hellespoint majestically covered with his vessels, what did he do?...He wept.  When Artabanus asks him why, Xerxes replies, &quot;There came upon me a sudden pity, when I thought of the shortness of man's life, and considered that of all this host, so numerous as it is, not one will be alive when a hundred years have gone by.&quot;-Xerxes is, in a way, a Herodotus himself.  He is one of the first characters to come down to us with a deep awareness of the passage of time and how fleeting human existence is.-He possesses an awareness that points to what writing a history is all about...He is, whether we like it or not, one of us.	2000-12-19

It marks the end of Thoreau's greatness as a writer. There are a thousand Naturalists, brilliant in their field of expertise, who could have have written works just as good as The Maine Woods and, in fact, have done so. But not one of them could have written a book like Walden.  Where is the Thoreau who, as Emerson remarked at his funeral elegy, seemed to have had a sixth sense which the rest of us were deprived of?  A sense that could feel and detect the mystical power in Nature trembling all aroung him at all times?...He is not in The Maine Woods in any case.  Thoreau was essentially America's Wordsworth.  In virtually all of Walden, particularly in chapters such as Higher Laws, there is that sense in his delicious prose and in his descriptions of his interactions with Nature, that there is an unseen power just beyond the veil of the visible, that we stand in the midst of some deep mystery which unadulterated Nature lifts aside from time to time; The same sense famously to be found in Wordsworth's best Nature poems....But you won't find much of this in The Maine Woods.  Thoreau seems depressed and morose much of the time, and it is clear that he spends much of his time in his endless classifications of flora and fauna as an escape from the harsh conditions surrounding him through much of the journey.  By harsh, I mean aesthetically harsh (as, for example, a previous reviewer has noted concerning the logging already felling trees apace.)  Thoreau was a famously physically vigorous man until the end.  Physically harsh conditions were nothing new to him.  Also, I don't mean to belittle Thoreau as a Naturalist.  All are agreed that he was a serious (what we would nowadays call a &quot;professional&quot; one), in no sense amateur.  But there is none of the sheer wonder and joy that we find in Walden and which made it my favorite book and Thoreau my favorite writer for years....I keep thinking of a line by Yeats, &quot;...Who could have foreseen that the heart grows old?&quot;een that the heart grows old?&quot;	2000-12-18

It used to be anthologized a lot, but I'm not so sure it is anymore, as its author, James Dickey, is not in current fashion among hommes de lettres.  Perhaps he never was.  He was never particularly fond of them himself anyway.  The poem is entitled &quot;Cherrylog Road,&quot; and I respectfully request that everybody who has read Slowness go dig up this poem at your local library, or wherever, and read it, slowly.  It is a poem about decay and death and love, and the exhilaration one feels after coming into the arms of all three in a necessarily short period of time because of the girl's overprotective father.  As he is speeding away from the junkyard where they made love, the narrator is &quot;wild to be wreckage forever.&quot;  The poem almost takes your head off...This is poetry.  This is literature.  This is writing for the ages....In other words, this is everything Slowness is not. It does not drop names. It does not, as Tolstoy says of simple-minded people, assume that human nature changes from one generation to the next.  It is not smug and ironical, allowing the writer a way out for what is just bad writing.  At the end of the book, Kundera wants his Chevalier to be happy (presumably one has to have a chaise to hop into to be happy).  Or does Kundera?  You never can tell with these sophisticated European writers...In any case, Dickey's motorcyclist is MORE than just happy.  He is in love with love, life, death and, yes, wild, drunken speed!!-Human beings, you know, are complex enough to enjoy Proust AND this whirlwind spritual intoxication as well.  The Chevalier's happiness in NOT &quot;our only hope&quot;...You Europeans know this.  You've all read Rimbaud. Right? What is it with this Kundera guy?  Smug, banal, writing does not pass muster for literature as far as I'm concerned.  The only reason I gave the book even 2 stars was because the premise (or what, as far as I can tell, is the premise), that reflection on past moments of beauty is part of being human and that without it, we couldn't have literature at all, has merit.  But read Proust, not Kundera. Or, if you don't feel like wading through 3,000 pages at the moment, just go dig up Dickey's poem.  In it, you will find detailed and delicate recollections of a slowly (despite the father) consumated tryst as well as the rapture of SPEED....Then go rent yourself a motorcycle and have some fun...Or (ahem) you may after all prefer a chaise.gave the book even 2 stars was because the premise (or what, as far as I can tell, is the premise), that reflection on past moments of beauty is part of being human and that without it, we couldn't have literature at all, has merit.

These criticisms, I submit to you, are true to one degree or another (usually to a very large degree), and all these elements abound in Bleak House.  And yet, it IS a great work.  The reason, say 50 years ago, that to mention Dickens was to invoke laughter among highbrow company is that, at the time, Joyce and Eliot and Pound and interior monologue and &quot;New Criticism,&quot; whose creators, for criticism is creation too, such as E.B. White and Cleanth Brooks, condemned their school of thought by bestowing upon it a name that makes it look silly 50 years later, were in the ascendant and Dickens, frankly, was considered a vulgarian who wrote shameful potboilers for the Victorian masses....Again, he did.  Those workhouse scenes from Oliver Twist were taken from his own life, and he wrote, especially early on, to eat.  So, why is Bleak House a great work given that all the criticisms of it are pretty much on the spot?....Because, the criticisms miss the point of such a work entirely, and, of course, becuause once pedants and academics latch on to a notion of what makes a literary work good or bad, they stick with it, wrong though they may know it to be.  Otherwise, their careers spontaneously combust, just as the corporeal presence of a certain character in Bleak House does....What DOES make Bleak House great is hard to put one's finger on.  To begin with, it is not, emphatically, the legal satire that several readers have pointed out as being the essential point of the work. Although the legal satire is obviously a major theme of the work, it is not what makes it a great work of art-Everybody knows that lawyers are rats.-Rather, it is the view of the world embodied in London and its environs (picked up on by a few of the more keen reviewers) that makes the novel unique and one for the ages. There are several passages I could quote to illustrate this subtle genius of Dickens at presenting a unique worldview of the space and time that the characters find themselves in.  The best, I think, is Esther's accout of the final walk to the burial ground: &quot;I have the most confused impressions of that walk. I recollect that it was neither night nor day; that morning was dawning, but the street-lamps were not yet put out; that the sleet was still falling, and that all the ways were deep with it. I recollect a few chilled people passing in the streets.  I recollect the wet house-tops, the clogged and bursting gutters and water spouts, the mounds of blackened ice and snow over which we passed, the narrowness of the courts by which we went.  At the same time I remember...that the stained house fronts put on human shapes and looked at me; that great water-gates seemed to be opening and closing in my head, or in the air; and that the unreal things were more substantial than the real.&quot;  This is the true vision of the world they all live in.  It is this powerful dark visionary imagery interspersed throughout the book that render it immortal.

I met him once (in 1991) and talked to him on the phone every now and again after that.  He was out of sorts much of the time, and not much of a conversationalist.  But occassionally he would be on the upswing and revert to his old self.  He loved the title of my first, unpublished novel, Seamarks, and used to always tell me &quot;I'm on yo' side son!&quot;-So, I suppose all this biases me, though I'm not sure in which direction, because I haven't sorted out my feelings toward this great man of letters, old enough to be my father or grandfather, who encouraged my efforts as a literary artist during the past decade.  I truly don't like that this book was published, as is, so soon after his death.  It doesn't take the shrewdest person in the world to figure out that the editors were trying to capitalize on his death while he was still fresh in the ground.  I don't know how they selected which letters to publish.  But I don't like whatever methods they employed.  The letters just don't cohere like they should.-It seems to me, truth be told, that there wasn't much method or forethought; more a rush to publish what looked passable as a chronological sequence of some of his correspondence.-Such is the posthumous fate of a great artist.  I made it a point to get to know Dickey because I thought, and still think, him to be the last truly geat poet alive.  It just happened that he lived in Columbia, a two hour drive from my native Greenville.-Dickey was the last poet that I know of in the tradition of the visionaries of the early 19th Century.  Though he would deny this at times, his son's memoir has him comparing himself to Shelley just before his death.-Also, the great English writer Malcolm Lowry had a TREMENDOUS influence on him, as the letter recounting Dickey's visit to his grave shows.  Dickey was always recommending Lowry's works to me (particularly Lunar Caustic, an out-of-print autobiographical work regarding Lowry's stay in New York's Bellevue psychiatric hospital for alcoholism treatment.) - I'd already discovered Lowry years ago and read just about every word written by him three times over. - Chris Dickey may or may not know this, but those lines his father quotes from Goethe at the end of the book (attributing them to his mother) are from one of the three opening quotations to Lowry's masterpiece, Under the Volcano.  The point of all this emphasis on Dickey's debt to Lowry is that Lowry was one of the last in the same tradition.  I'm just making my case.  I think the earliest letters in this selection the best.  I got a particular thrill of how taken he was with the now forgotten English poet Ernest Dowson.  I was mentioning poets I liked when I met him in '91 (He was not in a particularly good mood, by the way.)and he kept stoliidly shaking his head and saying &quot;never heard of him.&quot;  But when I mentioned Dowson, he perked up, and a twinkle glimmered briefly in his eyes.  Dowson drank himself to death in his early thirties, the victim of unrequited love, among other things...What Dowson, Lowry, Shelley and Dickey all have in common is that they viewed their roles as writers as seers, visionaries and prophets who, through their work, brought what others could not feel or see into the written word, and thus into the worlds of others less gifted....This is Dickey at his best, and this is why his letters are worth reading, to understand how such a person recognizes such a gift and evolves into a human being capable of expressing unparalleled beauty and unworldliness.  I would, however, recommend that the reader wait upon a more comprehensive, less higgeldy-piggeldy collection of his letters.  In the meantime, this one will have to do of course.  Dickey could also be a monstrous jerk, as those of you who've read Hart's bio, The World as a Lie, know all too well.  Hart did a great job, by the way, and I don't have the same reservations about his bio as I do about the publication of these letters.  But buy this book anyway and read it.  There aren't any poets like Dickey around anymore, and such a man's letters are worth reading...Although, who knows, maybe there are some left in this sound bite world of Oprah Winfrey show poetry.  If you find one let me know, it will be like catching a falling star...My apologies to John Donne.ns about his bio as I do about the publication of these letters.

This is a review of Thucydides' The Peloponnesian War rather than Strassler's edition of it, as many of the other reviews more or less are.  But hats off to Mr Strassler!  He should receive an award, a salary increase, a villa on the Riviera...Something commensurate with his painstaking and infinitely helpful notes and elaborations and maps, maps, maps!-Now I know where everything is.  The previous editions of Thucydides I've read were rather scanty on maps (i.e., They didn't have any.)  All readers of this edition owe Strassler a bundle for making us more successful readers of an author who, at times, can be a bit on the difficult, if not to say inscrutable, side.  What do we have to learn from Thucydides?  As several reviwers have pointed out, Thucydides intended his opus as a work for the ages.  But what were &quot;the ages&quot; supposed to glean from this first thorough account of war in the Western world?...  Why men go to war?  How to prevent war? How to be successful in war? What it means to go to war?...Just what did he intend?  Nobody really knows the answer to the question.  But I've read the work several times (never with a clearer understanding than after fnishing the Strassler edition) and have some ideas that might prove helpful.  First off, one thing Thucydides almost certainly meant by declaring that his work was for the ages was that war is a permanent condition of mankind.  Man has always and will always go to war.  It's part of what we would call human nature or (if we wanted to be upscale about it), man's genetic make-up.  This means that man is not, as Aristotle famously intoned, the rational animal, but irrational to the core.  But, still, what does this really mean?  The deepest impression I've always taken away from Thucydides was how moved, how liberated, how emboldened, indeed how festive the people were when they learned of an imminent war.  What is this feeling, and why do people react to what, one way or another, is going to bring mayhem and slaughter into the world? In Book Six, concerning the Athenian attack on Syracuse, which Nicias (the Athenian General) and those Athenians with any military insight at all regarded as the naval equivalent of the charge of the light brigade (or would have thought of it in those terms, if the British had been around to tell them about it at the time), Nicias makes a famous speech before the Athenians, rationally explaining all the reasons that the expedition would prove disastrous.  As recorded in these pages, however, Nicias' speech had the opposite of the intended effect...&quot;Everyone FELL IN LOVE with the enterprise.&quot; ...So, eventually, the defeated Athenians ended up being held in quarries near Syracuse for eight months under the most extreme conditions before being sold as slaves.  Nicias was executed.  Thucydides says,&quot;This was the greatest Hellenic achievement of any in this war,or, in my opinion, in Hellenic history; at once most glorious to the victors, and most calamitous to the conquered (i.e., the Athenians).&quot;  I think one of the lessons, the most important to me, to take away from Thucydides is that love (that &quot;many splendored thing&quot;) can be horribly, horribly dangerous and destructive.  What is it that the Nazi soldiers felt toward their Fuhrer, or the Chinese toward Mao, or the Confederate soldiers toward General Lee?---LOVE: a grand, noble emotion...The grandest, the most noble...Thucydides understood more amount human nature than many a philosopher.  He reached his conclusions from what people did, rather than ruminating about them from secluded groves.  The most important thing I have learned from reading him is a different level of introspection.  When the band plays The Star Spangled Banner now (as when I was watching the Australian Olympics) and my heart leaps inside me and tears come quickly to the corners of my eyes....I stand back and look at myself and wonder...Is this the way the Athenians felt?

We all know that nobody can write a review of this book without eliciting strong emotions and offending some group or the other, no matter what one says.  But I think the book is unique, worth a review, and let the flaming coals fall where they may.  First off: I think T.S. Eliot was a useless poseur and snob when it came to criticism (though I do like some of his poetry, particularly The Four Quartets.)  I read his intro anyway and the only thing I agreed with him on was &quot;...that it is so good a novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly appreciate it.&quot;  This is ominously true.  So true, that those who read it because it is a &quot;lesbian&quot; or &quot;gay&quot; novel without a deep appreciation of poetry are bound to be dumbfounded...By the way, Barnes herself stated that she wasn't a &quot;lesbian,&quot; per se.  She just happened to fall in love with a woman.  These artists, they just don't want to fall into our pigeonholes. Do they?...All this having been said, I humbly admit that I don't know exactly what the book is about and I'm not too sure Barnes did either, much less Eliot.-One of my favorite anecdotes about Barnes is her meeting with the equally poetic novelist Malcolm Lowry.  Lowry remarked later to his wife that he couldn't decide if Nightwood was a work of genius, the results a disorder of some kind, or both (The same could be said of Lowry's work, by the way.)  Anyway, I think this is about as honest as criticism of Nightwood gets.  My apologies to Ph.D candidates!  Eliot's initial assessment is correct: The &quot;Watchman, What of the Night?&quot; chapter is the most beautiful, most poetic and most unique in the book.  Unfortunately, the retentive Eliot found a need to make rational sense of it all, and so retracted what his not so retentive heart told him initially.  It is passages like the following that make the work unique in a darkly wondrous way: &quot;Have you thought of the night, now, in other times, in other countries,-in Paris?...not to mention the palaces of Nymphenburg echoing back to Vienna with the night trip of late kings letting water into plush cans and fine woodwork! No,&quot; he said, looking at her sharply, &quot;I can see you have not!  You should, for the night has been going on for a long time.&quot; and &quot;those who turn the day into night, the young, the drug addict, the profligate, and that most miserable, the lover...These can never again live the life of the day.  The light does not become them any longer....&quot;  What am I suppose to say about these passages?  They are as dark and beautiful and lovely as anything in literature.  If you get it, you get it.  If you don't, well, there's a hole in my head concerning mechanical manuals.  Not everybody's cut out for poetic prose.  There are plenty of more pedestrian works out there about gays, lesbians, feminism etc.  No doubt I'm missing the whole point of this novel according to informed reviewers.  No doubt the convoluted plot can be made sense of and parsed and diagrammed out for me in several different ways.  But please spare me.  Barnes was a disturbed individual (as most artists are) and unhappy (as most passionate lovers are). Not everything she wrote made much sense.  But much of what she wrote created a unique beauty.  It is for lovers of beauty to whom I recommend this book....Those who insist on reading it with an axe to grind or with a vested interest to confirm will find themselves in uncharted waters: Dark waters with a beauty beyond them.other countries,-in Paris?...not to mention the palaces of Nymphenburg echoing back to Vienna with the night trip of late kings letting water into plush cans and fine woodwork!

Appropriately, because the writing resembles nothing so much as an (at times) divinely inspired inebriety.  He bounces from one form of writing to the next (poetry, descriptive prose, vituperative essay) without so much as a feint of a segue.  There is really no narrative form to speak of.  It seems clear (to me at least) that Agee didn't know himself what he was doing at times, and the striking pictures of Evans never seem to connect in the way they should with Agee's prose.  It's rather like the characters in James Dickey's Deliverence stumbled out into a swath of impoverished farmland to write a book and take some pictures rather than into a soon-to-be dammed up river to take an ill-advised canoe trip.  (One is not surprised, somehow, to learn that Agee was one of Dickey's great literary heroes.)  ....And yet, for all the muddle, or perhaps because of it, the book has a disconcerting charm that will not let one be.  I don't know where to pinpoint it or how to analyze it.  But it's there, like some mischievous elf standing before your eyes who will not leave no matter how many times you open and shut your eyes and shake your head...There is a paragraph in the &quot;On The Porch&quot; section toward the end of the book, describing a girl in the dawning of her sexuality: &quot;A phase so unassailably beyond any meaning of tenderness and of trust, so like the opening of the first living upon the shining of the young earth in its first morning...&quot;  In the book's finest moments, in Agee's best sections of writing, we feel this painfully fleeting innocence and bliss wafting over the lives of the simple and hard-bitten tenant farmers, a presence almost physical amidst the cruel hardships they endure.  Perhaps this is part of the book's mysterious hold on generations of readers.ruel hardships they endure.  Perhaps this is part of the book's mysterious hold on generations of readers.	2000-12-12

For the book is simply this: An account of one person's love of literature and an elaboration thereof.  Bloom continually reiterates (and all reviewers admit this, without going any further) that Bloom contends that the criteria of works of art should be aesthetic: not political, social, theoretical etc.  But all this means is that books shoud be judged on whether they appeal to you, whether they move you, whether you have come to love them: &quot;aesthetic&quot; comes from a Greek word meaning &quot;to feel.&quot;  Personally, I think his Bardolatry is mostly ludicrous.  But this is Bloom's book, not mine.  While, on the other hand, his chapter on Emily Dickinson is the most profound and moving I have ever read on her poetry.  It is aesthetic.  It moved me.  I loved it.  So there.  My disagreements with him don't really matter to me because no two people are going to see eye-to-eye on everything, and I don't regard this book as prescriptive.  It is descriptive.  It is descriptive of views that have come to be held by a literary genius and great lover of the written word over a long period of time.  I appreciate it and (yes) love it on that level.  It has no theory, per se, to promote, no cause to advocate, no fight to pick (Bloom himself likes to say, regarding literary fads and theories, &quot;Whatever it is, I'm against it.&quot;).  Yes, he's rather down in the mouth about the current state of academia.  But aren't you down in the mouth about something too?  The Western Canon has likes and dislikes.  It is idiosyncratic.  It is aesthetic. It is irrational.  It is insane.  I love it.ne.  I love it.	2000-12-11

This is essentially a book by an extremely well-read and erudite misanthrope who pours (not undeserved in many cases) scorn upon most everyone he meets and every place he visits, preferring to reflect on the dead authors and men of genius admired by him who visited or inhabited these places. (One exception: ALMOST dead in the case of Paul Bowles.)  His basic approach can be summed up in a statement in Chapter 7 he makes regarding the Sardinians: &quot;Excessive friendliness is perhaps a philistine trait; in a place where no one reads, no one values or understands contemplative solitude, and so they need each other to be friendly and talkative.&quot; It doesn't seem to occur to him that a man might be complex enough to be both extremely friendly and extremely contemplative; perhaps because Theroux himself is not, or perhaps because to recognize the possibility would staunch the outpour of his vile, which is really what this book is all about.  The book does have its moments.  Snide remarks have their place, and his dismissive, irreverent comments on Syrian president Assad and his contempt for the Israeli dependence on American largesse hit the mark like no other writer can.  But anyone familiar with Theroux's work can not help but be reminded of his alter ego and the protagonist of his earlier novel, The Mosquito Coast, who ends up destroying himself and his family because of his disdain for non-geniuses....Well, at least Theroux knows what he's about.  I can't really think of whom to recommend this book to besides intellectual snobs who are not MERE snobs but truly well-read and who get a rush out of hearing about where famous authors worked and lived, and, of course, what Theroux thinks of it all.  Theroux probably gives it all away when he (supposedly) visits the ailing Paul Bowles, and the first thing he records Bowles as saying as our author enters the room is: &quot;Yes, I know your books.&quot;.............All is vanity, saith the preacher.Bowles as saying as our author enters the room is: &quot;Yes, I know your books.&quot;.............All is vanity, saith the preacher.	2000-12-10
US	49315939	R32LQWPVEI1WD3	0679757708	942423367	Dr. Johnson & Mr. Savage	Books	5	11	13	N	N	A Romantic before his time	I'm writing these words under the assumption that anyone who has found himself looking at this review knows a pretty good bit about Samuel Johnson, English Literature in general and at least a little about Mr. Savage (if only from his rather appropriate surname.)  It's interesting how literary fads come and go; how a prominent poet or author of one era would find himself outcast in another, and, vice-versa; how an unknown of one era would find himself the talk of the town in another....Imagine Jack Kerouac in the days of Matthew Arnold!  But I digress. I think I am one of the few people (the only person that I know of, in fact, Mr. Holmes included) who regards Mr. Savage as a great poet, greater than almost any writing during his lifetime: Thomas Grey and Cowper might be exceptions.  He is an early, nearly forgotten path-setting pilgrim in the Romantic tradition, the Visionary Company (a phrase coined by Yeats and picked up as a title for his groundbreaking critical study of the Romantics by Harold Bloom).  He is a Shelley, a Rimbaud, a Hart Crane before his time.  Dr. Johnson is an anonymous, erudite scholar before his time.  There just happened to be no satisfactory English dictionary before he came along, so he became famous for writing the (endearingly quirky) first of its kind.  And there you have it.  This book is to be commended for revealing what we know of Johnson before he became the old curmudgeon we love to ridicule.  Like we all were at one time (Well, the better lot of us anyway.): Johnson was impressionable, naive and idealistic when he met the older Savage, and Savage was almost undoubtedly the subject Johnson had in mind when he penned &quot;Slow rises worth, by Poverty oppressed.&quot; in The Vanity of Human Wishes.  As Holmes makes clear, Johnson idolized Savage for some time, and with good reason.  Savage was what we would call &quot;the real thing,&quot; even though the book makes clear that he was a notorious liar, particularly about his birth.  What I mean is that he was truly a man possessed by his poetic daemon.  As Johnson himself put it, &quot;...what was Nature in Savage would in another be Affectation.&quot;  Besides Johnson's biography, The Wanderer (subtitled &quot;A Vision&quot;) is Savage's (just) claim to fame.  This review is no place to give the poem its full treatment.  But a few lines Holmes quotes from Canto V will suffice to make my point:&quot;Fishers, who yonder Brink by Torches gain,/ With teethful Tridents strike the scaly Train./ Like Snakes in Eagles claws, in vain they strive,/ When heav'd aloft, and quiv'ring yet-alive.&quot;  As Holmes astutely points out, &quot;There are moments when Savage's whole universe seems to be convulsed in pain like this, as if agony were the condition or proof of existence, 'quiv'ring yet alive.'...Mother Nature seems to be persecuting an orphaned Earth.  This is the central vision of The Wanderer.&quot;  You have to remember that this was the age in which Pope's pompous and didactic Essay on Man was the norm to gain a full appreciation of how original (and therefore unacceptable) such poetry was at the time. Compare this to Shelley's fragment on the moon (metaphor for himself of course): &quot;Art thou pale from weariness, of climbing Heaven and gazing on Earth, wandering compaionless?&quot; or Rimbaud's Le Bateau Ivre and his comment that &quot;Everything is spiritual.  Those things that are called material are merely what is evil in the spiritual realm.&quot;  Or Hart Crane's &quot;Bequeathe us to no Earthly shore until is answered in the vortex of our grave the seal's wild spendrift gaze toward Paradise.&quot;  These are the words of the lost and dispossessed, those whose visions of other worlds cause them to despair of this one.  But, let's not get too gloomy. The book is a rollicking good read for all that, and even readers not too keen on Savage will find it a page turner....Thank you Mr. Holmes for resurrecting a forgotten genius.What I mean is that he was truly a man possessed by his poetic daemon.

Yet, he manages to maintain his wry sense of humor throughout. This ability is especially significant when he is sent to what he drolly refers to as &quot;Happy Valley,&quot; an AA-based recovery center, to cure him of his addictions.  Because, as Sheed points out in the chapter (again drolly) entitled &quot;Notes on a Brainwashing,&quot; without a sense of humor, the thinking man (or woman) is doomed in such a program.  Unfortunately, neither Sheed nor his doctors nor I, for that matter, who freely admit to having gone through a Happy Valley experience of my own, know of any such centers that are not AA based.  It's sort of an easy way out for the medical and psychological professions.  Since nobody knows what causes addictions, the meetings serve as an almost cost-free way to deal with the situation.  So, like Pontius Pilate, they wash their hands of the patients, like Sheed and myself, and send them forth into a 12-step Orwellian wasteland.  I'm not going to dwell on everything that's wrong with AA.  This is a book review, not a speech made from a soapbox in Hyde park.  But, suffice it to say, as Sheed points out: 1.) If you so much as question the AA model, you are in Denial-Catch 22. 2.) The &quot;Blue Book&quot; on which the program is based, states that those who are unable or unwilling to follow their program are &quot;such unfortunates, constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves.&quot;  Sheed and I are such unfortunates.  That's why I bought this book after reading a review of it in the New York Review of Books. We dishonest folks have to stick together.  Sheed's rapier wit and dumbfoundedness at the sheer inanity of what he was going through at his Happy Valley tickled me so that I reread those chapters again and again, just to make sure that there WAS another sane person who had gone through such an experience.  Among other remarks, he calls his tenacious AA group leader &quot;Rover&quot; because of his insistence that everyone swallow the AA program whole, pointedly questions the AA slogan to &quot;Keep Coming Back&quot; until you &quot;get with it,&quot; astutely noting that if you hang around any crazy idea long enough some of its bound to rub off on you (When I was in my Happy Valley, it occurred to me that this tactic was something the Nazis, those masters of group psychology, would have put to effective use: &quot;Just come to a few more rallies at Nuremburg, you'll see!&quot;)and observes that the claims that the program works is belied by the number of Happy Valley patients who had been there before, several times!  I had the same experience. To sum up, I recommend this book to all those poor souls out there who went through Happy Valley experiences and thought (as I did, and do) that they were the only ones who thought something queer was going on.  It was, and the book will be an uplifting and enlightening read. I'm sure polio and cancer patients will benefit as well from the humor and love of life the author effuses.  So why didn't I give this book five stars?  Because all this droll cheerfulness is just a bit much.  The book becomes monotone, and Sheed therefore becomes suspect.  There are depths to be explored here that remain untouched.  To explore those depths (only if you like, mind you), with just as much drollery as Sheed's to keep you hopping along, I recommend Malcolm Lowry's Under The Volcano, one of the greatest works of the 20th century.ther remarks, he calls his tenacious AA group leader &quot;Rover&quot; because of his insistence that everyone swallow the AA program whole, pointedly questions the AA slogan to &quot;Keep Coming Back&quot; until you &quot;get with it,&quot; astutely noting that if you hang around any crazy idea long enough some of its bound to rub off on you (When I was in my Happy Valley, it occurred to me that this tactic was something the Nazis, those masters of group psychology, would have put to effective use: &quot;Just come to a few more rallies at Nuremburg, you'll see!&quot;)and observes that the claims that the program works is belied by the number of Happy Valley patients who had been there before, several times!

US	49315939	R3GNC8QNI2HTYR	089966606X	596716152	The Ambassadors	Books	5	45	48	N	N	An Aesthetic Triumph	This is a novel about a man named Strether, who is as obviously an alter ego of Henry James as Ralph Touchett is of Mr. James in Portrait of A Lady or, to jump continents and switch authors, the main character in Remembrance of Things Past is of Proust.  Strether is in Paris to retrieve his (hopefully?) future son-in-law Chad from the wiles of the City of Light and return him to New England so that Strether can marry, settle down and pass his waning years in Puritan New England (New England was still Puritan at the time.).  At least, that's the plan.  But once Strether arrives, something happens to him, and that mysterious something is what makes this work great.  One could easily sum it up and say that Strether becomes enraptured by beauty, and one would be quite right.  But to do so would be to miss the point....What is beauty? This is the question the novel essentially asks, all plotting and sub-plotting (and plenty of it) aside. Strether's paralysis because of his inability to  grasp what is holding him there and why he becomes one of the greatest procrastinators in English literature (not excepting a certain Danish prince) is the great theme around which all else revolves.  Strether is essentially a sensitive, cultured man with hyper-refined sensibilities. Alighting in Paris from the drab New England factory town awakens things in him that can only be perceived through the mind's eye of such a man.  He is a sort of Geiger counter which registers things missed by others not so equipped (i.e., the rest of the characters.) &quot;Strether had not for years so rich a consciousness of time-a bag of gold into which he constantly dipped for a handful.&quot; Ch.6  The beginning of Ch. 16 has a beautifully succinct line of his predicament, &quot;How could he wish it to be lucid for others, for any one, that he, for the hour, saw reasons enough in the mere way the bright, clean, ordered water-side life came in at the open window?&quot;  Reasons, that is, to stay in beloved Paris.  The denouement of the struggle between this sensibility and his deeply engrained New England morality becomes really beside the point.  All the tergiversations and multiple reflections and subtle dialogue that convey the consciousness of a great soul constitute the book's undisputed prominence.  I came away from the novel asking myself anew the question raised by Plato and other great philosophers and artists throughout history:  What is beauty?  What is the mysterious hold it has on us?  And why do those who feel its power most acutely, such as Strether, suffer the most?beloved Paris.

US	49315939	RUKOI9S9A0XXI	0391034391	95572530	The Collapse of British Power	Books	4	20	23	N	N	An eccentric book on how the British lost world dominance	Empires rise and fall.  We all know that.  It's simply part of the passing of time on one level.  But, of course, there are particulars on why an empire falls:Corruption at various levels, incompetent leadership, threats from abroad etc..  Gibbon, famously, wrote a magisterial 8 volume work on what went wrong with the Roman empire, and it still stands for a benchmark of this type of opus.  In it he skillfully narrates all the military and political vicissitudes that led to the foundering of the Roman ship of state.  Barnett, on the other hand, has the answer in one tsunami that sank the empire of merry old England:  All her leaders of the 20th century through WWII were educated in Victorian public schools that, under the philosophy of Dr. Thomas Arnold, turned them into, ahem, creampuffs and pansies.  This is the most succinct way of putting it.  As silly as this premise seems at first glance, the book is extremely well-documented and one comes away feeling that Barnett has a point, though he overstresses it a bit much. Barnett is what I would call a Machiavellian nostalgist.  He yearns for the days when crass English barons batttled it out with mattocks and halberds without qualms concerning world peace or evangelism or tea parties or knowledge of Greek and Latin or any of the things that went into making British culture what it was in the early part of the century.  But just as you are about to chuck the book as the work of an unbalanced mind, you are confronted with mounds of carefully documented statistics showing that the British did indeed fall behind Barnett's two nemeses, the United States and Germany, in modern industrialization: the production of ball bearings, mechanical lathes etc. primarily because of trade unions, Liberalism, and the fact that the best minds of the country had been indoctrinated with the Romantic notion that industrial interests were beneath them, according to Barnett.  Barnett's figures bare this fact out both before the Great War and between the wars.  This is all very interesting but beside the point of why one should read the book, in my opinion: 1) It gives an intensely well-documented account of the culture of appeasement in the British inter-war cabinets and 2) It is very funny.  The funniest chapter is perhaps the one on India, which Barnett regards as a useless sort of &quot;Jewel and the Crown&quot; affair which existed simply so British viceroys could be carried about in rickshaws and wallow in the White Man's Burden in the voluptuous East.  Of the other non-white colonies (besides Malaysia) he is even more dismissive, regarding them as drains on the mainland and characterizing them as &quot;stone-age&quot; or &quot;pre stone-age.&quot;  He pulls no punches and some of those punches hit dead center in the solar plexus of the British empire of the time. The interwar cabinet members are frequently characterized as Bertie Woosters with a sprinkling of Jeeveses in the Chiefs of Staff to help them out all too seldomly.  What one ends up with is a sort of side-angle view of the empire's demise.  But a richly elaborate one.  It's no secret that Britain was nearly bankrupt at the START of WWII due to mismanagement of her resources. Whether this mismanagement was due to Wordsworth, Shelley and the Bloomsbury circle is another matter.  It's also no secret that a small island cannot reign over the globe forever.  As Churchill put it after WWII, &quot;the world has grown large around us.&quot;...Still, what if it hadn't?r and between the wars.    This is all very interesting but beside the point of why one should read the book, in my opinion: 1) It gives an intensely well-documented account of the culture of appeasement in the British inter-war cabinets and 2) It is very funny.    The funniest chapter is perhaps the one on India, which Barnett regards as a useless sort of &quot;Jewel and the Crown&quot; affair which existed simply so British viceroys could be carried about in rickshaws and wallow in the White Man's Burden in the voluptuous East.  Of the other non-white colonies (besides Malaysia) he is even more dismissive, regarding them as drains on the mainland and characterizing them as &quot;stone-age&quot; or &quot;pre stone-age.&quot;  He pulls no punches and some of those punches hit dead center in the solar plexus of the British empire of the time. The interwar cabinet members are frequently characterized as Bertie Woosters with a sprinkling of Jeeveses in the Chiefs of Staff to help them out all too seldomly.    What one ends up with is a sort of side-angle view of the empire's demise.  But a richly elaborate one.

For the author feels himself utterly isolated from other men, not even deigning to recognize them as men at all but as &quot;fleeting-improvised-men&quot; which &quot;creates a feeling in me at times as if I were moving among walking corpses.&quot; (Ch. 15)  What I found so disturbing about the elaboration of the author's viewpoint and recounting of his tribulations in the asylum is that there is something in his viewpoint that rings essentially true: We do not and can not know even those closest to us on the deep spiritual or &quot;nerve language&quot; level the author exists on in perpetuum.  It is this essential truth combined with the author's matter-of-fact, almost cheery, tone that made reading this work such a strange experience for me. For English readers, such characters do exist in fiction (Poe's Usher kept occuring to me, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein), but the tone of such psychically unstable characters and what we would call their nervous disposition are consonant with a mind gone awry and thus not to be taken so seriously.  Of Schreber, just the opposite impresses itself upon the reader.  It is this dissonance between tone and subject matter that render the book strange.  For the view it expresses is essentially a dark one.  If one reads closely, a terribly dark one.  The only thing comparable to it is the worldview of the Gnostics: That this world is essentially some sort of mistake, and that there may be no way to &quot;fix&quot; it, as it were.  The main reason to read the book, to my mind, is that it is a well-written,non-fiction account of a unique state of being (although readers might want to check out Proust as well as The Gnostic Religion by Hans Jonas for similarities.)  But, caveat lector, the book is not for the faint of heart.  It may keep you up many a night.  It did me!matter that render the book strange.  For the view it expresses is essentially a dark one.
