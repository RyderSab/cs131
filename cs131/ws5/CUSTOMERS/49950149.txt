Our kids are now all teenagers and have enjoyed exploring Robinson's book. <BR>Children LOVE to experiment with their world. \\"The Everything Kids' Science Experiments Book\\" offers parents and kids alike a wide array of adventures in science including: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Earth Science, and the Human Body. This book is oriented to kids ages 7-12 but offers information and exploration for budding scientists of all ages. I appreciate this book's easy entrance into the world of science and the three levels of experiments for each area of science: 1)Simple Home Experiments; 2)More Detailed \\"Kid's Lab Lessons\\"; 3)Science Fair Projects. The art layout (including multi-color printing, fun-graphics, puzzles, and side-bars), the splashy presentation of information (including fun facts, words to know, dumb-jokes, online science websites and cool quotes) and a complete index make this book an excellent resource for parents, homeschoolers and science teachers.

We don't take earthquakes casually in our coastal village. Our beach town is highly vulnerable to earthquakes and tidal waves. Our beachfront grade school is located just a few feet above sea level, and has the distinction of being the most vulnerable school in the nation to the threat of a tsunami. My children grew up in that school.<br />The day the earthquake hit, one son was in Middle School (10 miles away), one in High School (12 miles away) and one in college (90 miles away). My wife called to discuss what we should do. &quot;They're in God's hands&quot;, I said, trying to sound reassuring. We've always believed our children belonged to God first. I found myself fighting away feelings of fear, wondering what we would do if it were a real emergency, with a 30-foot wave crashing into our village resulting from an offshore earthquake.<br />I've always been amazed at how many thoughts can crash through our brains in a few short moments: Have we adequately prepared our children for facing emergencies? Have we spent enough time with them? Did we love them enough? Have we successfully given them a solid foundation of faith in Jesus Christ? What could we have done better as parents?<br />The only waves to break over our coastal village that day were waves of panic and then relief when we heard the &quot;all clear!&quot; signal on the emergency loudspeakers in town. The earthquake was an inland quake, centered 100 miles away. Though the earthquake did cost over $2 billion dollars in damage to buildings and property in the northwest, no tsunami hit our town that day.<br />That night at dinner, our family joined hands in a circle and prayed together, thanking God for protecting us and watching over our lives even when the earth shook under our feet. Then we talked practically about what we would do in the event of a major earthquake and tsunami.<br />&quot;The Christian Family Toolbox&quot; provides parents with the type of guidance and encouragement we discussed at our family dinner the night of that earthquake: spiritual foundations and practical tools for building stronger families, families equipped to face times when the foundations begin to shake.Family Toolbox&quot; provides parents with the type of guidance and encouragement we discussed at our family dinner the night of that earthquake: spiritual foundations and practical tools for building stronger families, families equipped to face times when the foundations begin to shake.	2001-09-03

You come away from &quot;Secrets&quot; and &quot;Jabez&quot; invigorated by God's grand vision for your life, desiring to do more for God and be more in God.  This is a wonderful gift Wilkinson offers to readers, both Christian and others.  <br />I have some major theological critiques of &quot;Secrets&quot; when placed beside the Greek text of John 15:1-17, the portion of John's Gospel from which Wilkinson draws his secrets of the vine.<br />1) Wilkinson empasizes a distinction throughout the book between &quot;discipline&quot; and &quot;pruning&quot;.  This distinction is not found in the Greek text of John 15.  Raymond Brown, the great John scholar writes in his definitive commentary on John, &quot;Verse 2 describes two different actions of the vinedresser.  The first, that of cutting off branches that cannot bear fruit, takes place in February-March.  Sometimes the vines are so completely cut back that one sees in the vineyards only the stalks bereft of branches.  Later (August), when the vine has put forth leaves, comes the second stage of pruning, as the vinedresser pinches off the little shoots so that the main fruit-bearing branches get all the nourishment&quot; (The Gospel According to John, Vol.II, pg.675). Both verbs describe pruning activities of the vinedresser.     <br />2) The imperative (command) word in the Greek text is NOT &quot;Bear Fruit!&quot;  Wilkinson places his major emphasis for our lives upon bearing more and more fruit, upon producing.  This emphasis is not in the Greek.  The word, &quot;abide&quot; or &quot;remain&quot; (Gk:menein) is found 10 times in the Greek.  Fruit is found 7 times.  Twice the word for abide is a command, &quot;meinate&quot;!  Here is the true emphasis of Jesus' teaching: not upon production of more and more fruit (good works according to Wilkinson), but upon simply abiding in the Vine (intimacy with Christ) and having the Vine abide in us.  You must read through 88 pages before this central teaching on abiding from John 15 is found in Wilkinson's writing.  I would recommend readers to skip over pages 1-88 and go directly to &quot;More with God&quot; on page 89.  Fruit is a by-product of remaining in Jesus and having Jesus remain in us, not the goal of our lives.  <br />3) I don't know where the 4 baskets come from.  They are not found in the Greek text of John 15.  There is enough in John 15 to interpret without adding in more imagery to distract readers from Jesus' teaching.  <br />4) Fruit for Wilkinson equals &quot;good works&quot;, both outward and inward.  The context of John does not favor this understanding of fruit.  John's gospel emphasizes the fruit of Christlikeness, eternal life and being filled with grace and glory, NOT mere good works.  <br />5) Even in Wilkinson's teaching on &quot;Abiding&quot; there are some disconcerting human-centered viewpoints which are not found in the Greek text of John 15.  He writes on page 95, &quot;In abiding, it's always our move!&quot;  No.  Both Christ and Christian can move.  In fact, Jesus emphasizes his choice and appointment towards the end of his parable when he says, &quot;It was not you who chose me; it was I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will remain&quot; (John 15:16).  Wilkinson also offers a dangerous understanding of &quot;abiding&quot; on page 122 when he states, &quot;If you are in a season of abiding...&quot;  Abiding is never a mere &quot;season&quot; in the life of a follower of Jesus Christ but the vital relationship which keeps us alive and growing.  Wilkinson envisions three seasons in the believers' life: a season of discipline, a season of pruning and a season of abiding.  This is a forced interpretation of the Greek text.  Abiding is a lifelong, intimate, growing relationship with Jesus, the Word become flesh, full of grace and truth.  <br />Apart from these textual concerns, I found &quot;Secrets of the Vine&quot; a refreshing, uplifting sermon on fruitful living in Christ.  I'm delighted to see millions rediscovering the life-changing person of Jesus Christ through such writers as Bruce Wilkinson.  <br />For two more books on the life-changing person of Christ and fruitful living for parents, look into &quot;The Family Cloister: Benedictine Wisdom for the Home&quot; (New York, Crossroad, 2000) and &quot;The Christian Family Toolbox: 52 Benedictine Activities for the Home&quot; (New York: Crossroad, 2001), both by David Robinson.	2001-07-30

Few theologians write with such practical, common sense.  Few church growth pastors write with such theological depth.  The mix of deep Christ-centered theology and ideas for living in community as a daily practice are what make Bonhoeffer's Life Together such a classic.  Okay, I disagree with some of his overly strict opinions about communal life, such as his ban on singing in harmony.  But these small critiques are minor compared with the riches that can be easily mined from this treasure mountain of a book on the challenges and glories of life together within the community called the Body of Christ, the Church.<br />For two other books on life together, written for parents as encouragement for the daily holy calling  of raising children, look for &quot;The Family Cloister: Benedictine Wisdom for the Home&quot;, by David Robinson (New York: Crossroad, 2000) and &quot;The Christian Family Toolbox: 52 Benedictine Activities for the Home&quot;, also by David Robinson (New York: Crossroad, September 2001).	2001-05-04

I takes an hour or two to read.  The actual prayer of Jabez in the Bible consists of less than 30 words (found in 1 Chronicles 4:10) and offers an excellent simple outline for prayer.  What I appreciate most about Wilkinson's book is his faithfulness to the spiritual calling of prayer over thirty years, focused around this simple outline for prayer.  He offers a variety of stories revealing God's hand at work, &quot;blessing&quot;, &quot;enlarging territory&quot; and &quot;keeping us from harm&quot;.  What concerns me about this book is two-fold: 1)How little of this book points people to the prayer Jesus taught us, called &quot;The Lord's Prayer&quot;, or the &quot;Our Father&quot; prayer.  This is the pattern of prayer Jesus gave to all humanity as our outline for prayer, our instructor in prayer.  &quot;The Prayer of Jabez&quot; would have been a deeper, more powerful book on prayer if the author had tied each of Jabez's prayer phrases to the &quot;Lord's Prayer&quot;, showing us God's gift of prayer as revealed by God's Son, Jesus Christ.  2) The other concern has to do with packaging and marketing.  At a very slim 83 pages of text in a 4x6 book, this essay is really a glorified magazine article. Yet, Multnomah puts it into a hardback format, with excellent graphics and layout, with quotation insets every few pages, making the work look bigger than it really is, and thus is selling for $...  Underneath this glitzy marketing design of the book, you'll find lots of devotional oriented writing, with faith stories to illustrate these devotional insights.  Yet, I longed for more meaty teaching from God's Word about the challenges of prayer, the &quot;breakthrough to the blessed life&quot; promised on the cover, and wrestling with such questions of how to handle prayerlessness, why are many of our prayers seemingly unanswered, and where is God when I'm hurting inside and trying my best to pray.  Bottom line: I'm grateful for Wilkinson's encouragement to pray and glad to see so many people across our land reading this practical guide to prayer.<br />For another book on prayer, this one for parents who desire to make prayer for a part of your family life together, look at &quot;The Family Cloister: Benedictine Wisdom for the Home&quot;, by David Robinson (New York: Crossroad, 2000) and the soon to be published new title, &quot;The Christian Family Toolbox: 52 Benedictine Activities for the Home&quot;, also by David Robinson (New York: Crossroad, Sept. 2001).ttom line: I'm grateful for Wilkinson's encouragement to pray and glad to see so many people across our land reading this practical guide to prayer.  <br />For another book on prayer, this one for parents who desire to make prayer for a part of your family life together, look at &quot;The Family Cloister: Benedictine Wisdom for the Home&quot;, by David Robinson (New York: Crossroad, 2000) and the soon to be published new title, &quot;The Christian Family Toolbox: 52 Benedictine Activities for the Home&quot;, also by David Robinson (New York: Crossroad, Sept. 2001).	2001-04-25
