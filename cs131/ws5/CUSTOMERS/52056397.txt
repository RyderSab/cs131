Literature has long recognized the need for poets to displace themselves from the familiar surroundings in order to sharpen the insights of empathy and vision. Hightower has undertaken such journeys, charting paths that guide us, his readers, into startling revelations. But what really impresses me is the way this poet is so attuned to the exceptional qualities of the ordinary, that even the Texas ranch, like Rome, can provide an important window into the world at large. Hightower never falters into sermon or presumption, but keeps his language honest and true to the stories he has to tell.	2001-11-07

To those of you who have read Alcala's earlier works, this is truly a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. To those who have not read the earlier works, you will only have your interest piqued. Alcala writes with authority about pre-revolutionary Mexico and the tales she spins are unforgettable accounts of strong women who persevere against personal and social challenges. This author's best achievement is the way she dispels the myth of the passive Mexican woman repeatedly in her compelling body of work.	2001-01-13

I welcomed this year's selections because Rita Dove made no apologies for her diverse list. Readers will like some and dislike some, but that's true for any anthology. I'm dismayed that people expect the same cluster of poets year-to-year; that would only happen if the editor didn't change. And that nonprogessive expectation also reflects the presumption that the same poets write memorable poems every single year of their careers--not so. Frankly, as Charles Simic proclaims, prolific poets are capable of bad poetry. I think Dove's has been the best collection so far because it gives us a taste of the big flavor that is contemporary American poetry. And let me be the first to congratulate her for not including many representatives of that stale vanguard, e.g. Ashbery.	2000-11-15

The working class male does not hide behind any mask, and I believe that Urrea's precise lines of his poem in Vatos captures this sense of openness and honesty. The working class face is a public face, even when the camera explores intimate moments. I surprised myself making connections between the men of these portraits and the men of my own family, and even more startling, I found myself identifying with these faces, which only attests to the exact vision of this project. An important contribution to the history of our people.	2000-10-29

It maps out an intelligent and complex world--the bicultural experience. Nostalgic and unidealistic, here is a Filipino-American voice struggling through the painful, always  important memories attached to contrasting landscapes--those of the U.S.  and the Philippines. My favorite poems were those that dealt with the  speaker's immediate family. And though the language is beautiful in many of  the poems, what really strikes hard is the honesty with which speaker tells  his (and his family's) stories.<br />Also recommend: Nick Carbo's SECRET ASIAN  MAN and Bino Realuyo's THE UMBRELLA COUNTRY.	2000-06-12

This read is indeed a trip through the  streets of NYC in the bohemian sense as seen through the fresh eyes of an  outsider among outsiders. Nick Carbo's self-referential poem was risky, but  he pulled it off. There is an experimental/metaphysical dialogue happening  here that blows me away--you'll have to read the book to find out what it  is. Highly recommend.	2000-06-03

These  poems lack authority. Most of the time I pictured a mousy woman afraid of  her own shadow, throwing her voice like a stuttering ventriloquist because  she was afraid to claim ownership of her own declarations. I pity those  that think this constitutes &quot;sophistication.&quot; What a disfavor to  budding poets who will be misled into believing small efforts like these  are publishable.

Soto has created three of the most charming losers--victims of circumstances and just plain bad luck--in this funny novel that chronicles their path to loserdom. Roberto, Silver and Gus are  three vatos trying to keep themselves righteous, but that's pretty hard to  do when nothing goes right and any attempt to persevere only hurts their  chances for survival even more. I can't say enough about the humor of this  book. It's about time we Chicanos learn to laugh at ourselves and Soto has  shown us one healthy way to do that--through on-the-mark writing, sharp,  satyrical, and yet sensitive.	2000-04-20

However, of all them I found the Carengie Mellon anthology more comprehensive and inclusive in the scope of its vision. It is the largest  with the highest number of younger writers (perhaps the press simply had a  bigger budget). But regardless, Daniels and Costanzo gathered here an  amazing group that reflects what will eventually become the diversified  literary canon of the future. There are many discoveries here and it is  obvious from the intro that the editors tried their best to search for  those finds that other anthologies overlooked. Reaching for the obvious  names would have been too easy a task, best left to lazier editors, so it  is with great admiration that I salute this, the most energetic effort to  date.	2000-04-03

I am appalled by the recent reader reviews of this book here.  I am a Filipino American myself.  I love reading poetry and good contemporary literature.  This might be the  reason why I enjoyed reading Realuyo's novel.  I thought the  &quot;official&quot; reviewers where right on the dot about this book.  I  found it in the Discover Great New Writers section of B&amp;N, and I  instantly bought it.  Unlike the other readers here, I was not  disappointed.  I understood what Realuyo was trying to do.  The book is  really not about Martial Law in the Philippines per se, but the lives of  this family who was affected by it.  Theirs is the kind of life that is  still being led by so many Filipinos.  It is a story that is both touching  and realistic.  I believe the beauty in the book lies in the manner it was  written: lyrical prose, poetic lines, and interspersed narrative style.  If  you read Stephen King, this may not be the book for you.  Realuyo's novel  and many novels like his are for people who enjoy collecting FINE  LITERATURE.	2000-03-13

I breezed through the collection rather quickly (it is that short and uncomplicated) and realized  that this pseudo-minimalism relies heavily on &quot;voice&quot; or  &quot;attitude&quot; rather and not much on the textures (such as landscape  and history) that have made Alexie and Diaz favorites among the critics.  The voices in these stories suffer from lack of bodies, ungrounded to the  rich soil that is New York. At first I thought this was done deliberately,  perhaps a commentary on the disenfranchised or the displaced persons. But  by the end I knew that this writer needed one more year of graduate school  to polish this project. Much luck on the next one.	2000-01-10

As a young gay Latino from a homophobic culture and in a racist environment, I needed  to know that the voices of brown jotos were important enough to be  expressed, written and certainly compiled in a book.

Still it is important in  that it fuels the dialogue about how the gay Latino serves as agent for the  non-Latino author's fantasies. This is a must for any queer studies  curriculum that analyzes how race and gender connect, and how the Latino  body continues to be exoticized even by marginalized literature.

Each member of this poor family in Manila has a  necessary passion that informs his/her actions throughout the novel. All  actions have consequences, Realuyo posits--those who are closer to us are  those whom we place in immediate danger. Filled with stunning imagery and a  love of language, THE UMBRELLA COUNTRY is an honest tribute to the dignity  of a people rarely explored in American literature. In brief, Wow!	1999-03-02
