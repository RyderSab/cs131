The plot, obstensibly meant to offer a degree of political satire, is not all that exciting (indeed, the secret behind the story is sort of unimpressive) and the read is far too quick, even compared to the Dortmunder books.  Westlake fans won't be angry with this, but they might wonder where the meat is.<br />Thankfully, we do get a good addition to the Westlake &quot;family&quot; of intelligent, interesting crooks and scoundrels in the form of Meehan.  He carries the book through some under-written bits, and helps cover for the two-dimensionality of the politicos Meehan encounters.  <br />However, after the dark strength of The Hook and The Ax, this one is a disappointment.  Guess everyone, even Westlake, has a n off-day.	2003-12-26

Solomon brings the long dead stars of the 1890s to vivid life, while reflecting on the dual nature of baseball as both game and business, and while looking at American life in the same era.  This work shows that in some ways little has changed - contraction is a very old idea, as is franchise relocation - and that in some ways the game has benefitted from the end of the reserve clause and the occasional need to reinvent itself.<br />The reader gets the chance to meet some fascinating characters, such as the young John McGraw, before his days as a manager; Charlie Ebbets, the name behind Ebbets field; and Ned Hanlon, perhaps the father of strategic baseball.  Moreover, this book captures the essence of the great pennants races of the past, when winning the regular season title was everything.  And it's truly bizarre to learn how much was stolen from Baltimore to build all three of NYC's major league teams.<br />I highly recommend this to baseball fans of all stripes, as well history buffs.	2003-09-17
US	50775744	RNN7DP4RUZH3R	0345253523	92926356	Imperial Earth	Books	3	21	23	N	N	Entertaining but Meandering	If you want to start reading the works of Arthur C. Clarke, one of the 20th century's great visionairies, you can do worse than this one, but you could also do better.  This work is basically the Earth of 2276 as seen through the eyes of an outsider.  A lot of what he sees is remarkable and quite plausible, and the cast of characters is generally likeable.  Like many Clarke novels, there is little in the way of conflict here - Clarke is not one for hero vs. villain - but unlike Childhood's End or 2001 or Rendevous with Rama, there is no sense of grandeur either.  There are just a lot of incidents that just barely add up to something more.<br />Still, Clarke's unusual approach to writing - he is the only novelist who writes in stle of an essayist - and his appealing vision of a mature secular utopian Earth still works after seeing it often.  Fans of dystopias are best advised to stay home. Fans of a happy tomorrow, where everyone is well-fed and sexually liberated and needs nothing more than a nice vacation, are invited in.<br />If you care for this, I recommend you move onto to his somewhat more action-oriented Rama and then to his masterowrk, Childhood's End.	2003-07-18

Gone, to a large degree, are the puns and comic events, and in their place is a gripping and occasionally melancholy tale of Ankh-Morpork's past.  Vimes is forced to relive the days of his youth as the man who trained him, and sees those diffuclt times through new eyes.  Along the way, we meet many characters in their youth, learn a lot about the city, and get very much inside Vimes' head.<br />The result is a work of near-brilliance, an examination of the human condition, the cities we build, the evil and the good in our world, and the role one man can play.  Vimes has evolved over the years from a rough-hewn satire of a beat cop to one of the most intriguing and human of heroes.  Here, without Vetinari or Carrot or Lady Sybil to play off of, he dominates the story as he never has before, and a rich tapestry becomes that much richer.<br />If you've never read a Discworld book, best to start with the earlier ones.  But if you've been to the Disc before, you must come back again and read this thriliing, gripping, sad, funny, heartrending, heartwarming and amazing novel.	2003-03-14

Rankin is a very good writer, but what he does best is setting up strong, shocking, and sometimes moving police precedurals around seeming mysteries.  Like the other Rebus books I've read, the resolution to the main mysteries is a bit weak, especially when compared to the other events in the book.<br />So that alone puts the Rebus books a bit below the Morse or Dalgleish novels.  However, John Rebus is almost as memorable as a plainclothesman as his English counterparts, rougher around the edges than either, hard to take but sympathetic.  He makes the books move as he bounces around, as we see him through the eyes of his colleagues and his enemies.  He's not an easy hero to like, but is an easy man to feel for.  The rest of the cast, some totally heinous, others much more pure, set him to sharp relief.  And the setting, while most likely not at all the true Edinburgh, helps a lot too.<br />Compared to American novles of this ilk, this series is a stunning gem.  Mystery and police drama fans alike could do far worse.	2002-10-22

There is a sense, as the Amazon review notes, that Lloyd wandered in from a Westlake book and stayed around.  The result is a rather jarring mix of characters.<br />Parker is still very much himself, thankfully, but even the caper is a bit flat.  At times, Parker seems to be a bystander.  I wonder if perhaps after reviving Parker and the Stark name, Westlake has again begun to tire of the noir world.<br />Still, you can do a lot worse.  This should make fine beach reading.	2002-06-18

The plot is a lot less realistic than those in previous Rucka works, but somehow Rucka pieces it together in a way that you can almost for how ridiculous some of the story in.<br />In this installment, Atticus Kodiak is now famous and his adventures involve a starlet, an activist heiress from England, and the shadowy world of assassins.  Much of the work is about a series of life-altering experiences for Atticus that shouldn't rign true at all, as they border on the preposterous.  But I turned the pages, my doubts were shoved aside and the action took off.  Rucka brings a lot of what he's used as a novelist and as a writer of rather down-to-earth comic books into every page and every plot twist.  When the book ends, the reader is left in shock at what's become of Atticus, and can't wait to see what Rucka does next with him.	2002-02-11

This work is fun until the strangeness and the improbability of the story bog down the last 50 pages.  Hiassen is a slightly better wordsmith than Leonard, and the Florida setting is more vivid than any setting that Westlake uses.  But based on this first voyage to Hiassen's world, he's not quite as good as the others.  The humor is not as sharp or ironic as a Westlake tale, and the bad guys are not as fun to watch be torn down as in either a Westlake/Stark or a Leonard.<br />Still, there are worse ways to spend a rainy day, and I suspect I will give a few other Hiassen works a try until the next Westlake book comes out.	2002-01-29

Compared with almost everything I've read by him - even with its cousin Promethea - it's shallow and simple.  Many of the characters really didn't grab me, especially the obstensible main character, Toybox.  Some of the characters are almost stick figures.  The occasional parodistic reference to older characters, such as the Fantastic Four or the JLA, seemed just silly instead of funny.  The mysteries that the cops of Neopolis solve, however, are generally engaging, and two or three of the cops did come across as intriguing.  Still, as Moore works go, this is slight.<br />The saving grace of this comic is the art by Ha and Cannon.  The heroes might not be much to read about, but they are something to see, as is the city of Neopolis.<br />If you want to read top-notch recent Alan Moore, though, try early issues of his Promethea series.  And for a trip to a city that is similar to Neopolis in its one-foot-in-the-future look but with a lot more in the way of great characters and story, lok for Dean Motter's Terminal City TPB.	2002-01-07

Then think about all the mythology flowing through her adventures.  Then stop and let Alan Moore show you how it's done.<br />Moore marks his return to deconstructionist super-hero comics with this gorgeous, often brilliant series.  While even the most diligent reader is likely to get a little lost as the star of comic learns about the legends of Promethea while taking on her mantle, the journey - at least at the beginning of this series - is truly worth it.  Moore, helped by the team of Williams and Gray, forges a stunning futuristic but believable world, creates a diverse and likeable cast, and has a lot of fun.<br />These issues are Promethea went it was still brilliant, before Moore's penchant for injecting his own religious and philosophical views into this book made later issues hard reading.  But for fans who missed the Alan Moore of V for Vendetta and Watchmen, this is must reading.  For fans of Wonder Woman who long for more than just action tales, this is must reading.  And for fans of great art with women as real as they are sexy, you can't go wrong either.	2002-01-07

A strong writing style and a balance between section detailing the business, political and personal parts of Hearst's life keep the reader engaged.  It's hard to believe the power one man had and harder still to believe that flexed it so often and so unsuccessfully on many occasions.  Students of modern politics will find an instructive history about a man who is in many ways the precursor to Michael Bloomberg, Steve Forbes and Ross Perot.  Students of journalism will find a man unlike any in the modern, more-or-less objective world of multinational media monsters.<br />The book only falls short at its end, when Hearst's final years are covered in a rushed manner and his attitudes and opinions regarding World War II and the early Cold War are barely discussed.  Also, at no point does Nasaw say when or why Hearst became known as &quot;The Chief.&quot;  And the chapter on &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; while necessary, is not too well written.<br />This book is not quite as good as Smith's biography of Colonel Robert R. McCormack, but it again shows that the great newspapermen of the past were far more important than many realize.	2002-01-03

It's an old, winning formula and makes for a good read.<br />But as the sequel to &quot;Casablanca,&quot; it can't hope to live up to the original.  What made the film is just not here.  The actors who brought rather limited characters to life are missed.  The sharp and quotable script is replaced by less lively dialogue and weak narration.  The love of the characters and the fun Walsh has with them keep this readable, but the original can't be imitated and perhaps should not have been continued.  Fans of the film are not likely to be angry with this, but some may be better off skipping it altogether.<br />As for the backstory of Rick Blaine, it's cute but I don't buy it.  Everyone knows Rick is really the great-grandson of Rhett Butler, descended from that illegitimate child he left in Charleston.  :)  Making Rick what Walsh did adds little to the character, even if the scenes in prewar NYC are fun to read.	2001-11-20

I've heard enough of Charles Osgood's work on the radio to know that he doesn't usually fear sacred cows, but he treats the vets and the war as such anyway.

Books	4	2	3	N	N	Long-Over Due Reissue of Classic Discworld Novel	This book, long out of print, introduces Pratchett's best heroes, Sam Vimes and Carrot, and sets up the adventures to come. To my surprise, the plot in here holds its own against those in later Vimes novels, and the large space given to the supporting cast is a delight to those who know Colon and Knobby, Vimes' deputies, from later books where they share the guardhouse with a much larger cast. I read the Guards book out of order, and now feel like I should re-read them in order. The whole subseries, even the anticlimactic &quot;Fifth Elephant,&quot; stand out from the rest of the Discworld books. Discworld is almost always good. Vimes is even better.	2001-08-28

While many of the supporting characters are fairly interesting, the main characters don't quite escpae from their penny dreadful roots.  The middle of the book, where the plot solidifies and the history and politics are stripped away to reveal a more larcenous heart, is very good, but it leads to a rushed and unsatisfying conclusion where the Spanish-American War oddly becomes only a footnote after many pages of build-up.  If you're expecting any real people to show up, try elsewhere.<br />This makes perfectly acceptable beach reading, but if you want a crime novel with bite, I'd recommend something by Donald Westlake/Richard Stark instead.	2001-08-17

The author spends far too much time going into detail about a small part of John Dee's life, and seems to lose presepctive about Dee's contributions.

Godwin does away with almost all the mystic trappings of the legend, and creates a historically inspired Arthur and Camelot, using the real Britain of the post-Roman era as the setting.  Most of the elements of the legend - from Lancelot's affair with Guinevere to the Holy Grail - are in here, but in forms that leave off the excessive romance and the excessive piety.  <br />At the heart of it is Arthur, a man above men but still a human.  His narration is full of wit and of regal bearing.  Here's an Arthur who could lead men but who is someone we'd want as a friend.  The best elements of the old legends are in him, with only a touch of the modern &quot;feet of clay&quot; that too many writers insist on giving him.<br />This is probably the best retelling of Arthur since Tennyson, and is a must-read for Arthurians, for English history buffs, and for those who love a good yarn.	2001-07-16

Gone are the vast numbers of Mirror Universe duplicates that cluttered Spectre and Dark Victory.  Instead, it's the main characters of the first two Star Trek shows, plus a handful of players created for these books.  The smaller cast makes the story a lot easier to follow.  Which is good, as the story is byzantine and doesn't quite hold together.<br />We race around between universes and ships and distant worlds, and leave the bulk of the Mirror Universe plots behind for one involving what may be a vast conspiracy by mysterious aliens to control all of Starfleet history.  As often is the case with such conspiracy threads, the result doesn't quite hold together, and leaves a few too many threads dangling.  The use of Kirk's evil Mirror twin is a bit hokey - we are left to wonder which Kirk Shatner thinks of as his true alter ego - and when it seems that all of human history might revolve around James T. Kirk, you wonder how anyone at Pocket Books can let any writer indulge himself as much as Shatner does.<br />That said, this is a fun book, one that makes me miss the crews of both NCC-1701 and NCC-1701-D at a time when the Trek franchise seems to be running out of steam.  Given that even Peter David is running out of things to say, I am left hoping that maybe the Reeves-Stevenses and their amateur friend with the longer-than-it-should-be writing resume might have a few more wild ideas left in them.	2001-07-09

Her skill as a writer, at creating characters and at creating an intriguing history for an alien world, is hard to miss and is welcome in a series of books that often lacks such skill.<br />However, the characters are not the ones we know from Trek.  The Vulcan she creates, where the repression of emotions is replaces by a simple control of them, is a long way from the Vulcan we've seen on TV and in the films.  She might be right in not liking the inconsistencies or the oversimplifications of Trek, but we don't read these books for a reinvention of the ideas but for a mere refinement.  Whatever world she's writing about, it's not cold, logical Vulcan in the end.<br />Still, you could do worse than this book.  Duane is no PAD or Reeves-Stevens &amp; Reeves-Stevens in terms of plot, but few can match her skill with words.	2001-07-06

But it's not in the same league as the previous Guards novels in the Discworld series.  The villains are not at all interesting, there are a couple of meandering subplots, and there can actually be too much of Samuel Vimes in one of these books.  I also don't quite get the metaphor that Pratchett is setting up with the otherwise-dopey title.<br />This is still very readable, with a few interesting new characters, and with some good scenes involving Cheery Littlebottom and Angua and Carrot.  The quality of the writing is still very good, but could have stood a bit of editing.  And Lady Sybil comes into her own as a character.<br />This was the Discworld novel that HarperCollins tried to use to make Pratchett a star here, but I suspect that new Discworld readers might be a bit more lost with this than with earlier books or with the novel after this one, &quot;The Truth.&quot;  If you're new to Discworld, my suggestion is to find &quot;Men at Arms&quot; or &quot;Jingo&quot; first as they are a bit less dependent on ideas introduced in other books in the series.  If you're not new to Discworld, you'll buy this no matter what.  You'll like a lot of it.  But you might wonder, as I do, whether Pratchett is making a mistake by issuing a new book in the set every six months.  A little more time to edit this and it could have been better.	2001-07-05

This work certainly benefits from that.  The plot is rather thin and rather bizarre, involving a group of accidental immortals, a precocious teen, a supercomputer, and a kooky future.  The grabber here is what surrounds the story: eccentric but believable characters, tongue in cheek narration, and a staricial glimpse of a future than may yet be.  This book is everything that &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; tried not to be: silly, never taking itself seriously, sharply satirical.  While many consider &quot;Demolished&quot; to be the classic, I found this to be the real Besterian deal.<br />If you're a fan of Bester, definitely try this.  If you only know Bester as the guy from PsiCorps, then you owe it to yourself to see why JMs named a character for Alfred Bester.  Clearly, he's one of JMS's influences.	2001-05-27

However, in the process of writing about the Patriot League, he isn't exactly struggling the way the players are.  So they get written about, and he gets another best-seller.  Seems hypocritical.  This doesn't ruin the book for me, but it does make me wonder about Feinstein's own morality.<br />As for the quality, there's a noticeable slip from past efforts.  I think that he's trying not to glorify the coaches or the game, but that he ends up telling too many similar stories.  The players deserve a good deal of credit, but after a while they blend into two or three types.  There are also flaws with the editing - the Coack K/Navy story shows up twice for no reason - and with the pacing.  The format is similar to his previous book about the ACC, but something aside from the big names is missing.<br />Still, this is a readable and enjoyable sports book that does remind us of the rest of the world outside of Duke and Carolina and the monster baskball schools.  I think that Feinstein should have gone to Division III, and that he does romanticize a bit too much - even without scholarships, these players are big shots in a way that us libeeral arts majors can't be.  But college basketball fans will enjoy this.	2001-05-07

Along the way, Collins casts serious doubts on the man convicted of the crime, Bruno Haputmann, and offers a fictionalized but believable account of the investigation and the trial.  Moreover, Collins also portrays Lindbergh with much less hero worship than the recent biography by Scott Berg.  While this is not meant as a work of truth, Collins provides a necessary balance to such books with this novel.<br />Most of all, though, it's a great read, suspenseful even though the ending is a matter of historical fact.

I loved &quot;Stealing Away&quot; and enjoyed the others I've read, but I figured that the more we saw, the harder it would be to swallow just how many famous mysteries Heller was involved in.  And that's what happened here, especially since Heller is far more involved with Amelia Earhart than he's ever been with a client or a victim.<br />That involvement colored the rest of the book in a way that was a bit more cynical than usual and that made Heller a lot harder to take.  I appreciate that the speculation about history's truth is just that, and that we can disregard the whole thing, but Heller's love for &quot;Amy&quot; makes almost every other character in a position of authority seem sordid if not evil.  The result is a rather simplistic narrative.  That Collins would treat Huey Long with more sympathy than any effort to spy on Japan in preparation for the inevitable war is perpelxing.<br />This is still a fun read, but it's just not the same as the earlier works.  And after you've had your hero sleep with Amelia Earhart, what's next?  Eleanor Roosevelt?	2001-04-25

This book about American foreign policy at the end of the Cold War is worth reading if only to show how not to run a foreign policy.  While Fitzgerald is clearly a liberal (as am I) and comes at the Reagan era from the left, I think she is thorough and fair in her treatment of many of the players in Reagan's world.  She is at her best in portraying Geroge Shultz and Colin Powell.  Her treatment of SDI is a bit weaker, as she doesn't seem to quite grasp the technical matters well enough to convey them.  She also is a bit tricky in not mentioning the idea of Star Wars defenses being potential offeesnvie weapons till the very end, as if afraid to talk about such things even though that fear is why I agree with her opposition to SDI.<br />As for how she treats Reagan, I wonder if anyone will ever be able to write a totally balanced and fair acconut of his presidency.  Loved by the right and loathed by the left, he doesn't seem to be more than a prop to both sides, and when his own sympathetic biographer can't get a handle on him, can anyone?  If nothing else, he is a lot more fascinating a character than more politicians and might even deserve all the books that former presidents are the subjects of.	2001-04-20

Yet Denny O'Neil, once a novelist before he became a full-time comics editor/writer, was able to take the messy parts and trim them down drastically.  He rehumanized Batman - perhaps turning him back in the slightly less mechanical hero of O'Neil's 1970s work - and toned down the melodrama.  The end result is a very readable and entertaining saga.  It doesn't hurt that Denny is also under no constraints to restore the status quo, and just by leaving the future of the hero in doubt at many points, he gives this version of the story weight it didn't have before.<br />This is a must for Batman fans, and a good read for anyone who likes action and adventure.	2001-04-16

But he, like too many science essayists, gives into an urge to emote and to put aside that vaunted rationalism.  Instead, he irrationally sides with popular opinion on when the new millennium began and then tells a somewhat moving but totally irrelevant story about a mentally handicapped young man who can calculate what day of the week a day came out.  He also indulges, less than usual, in his dislike of religion.<br />As a stylist, Gould is among the best in the world of science.  As a thinker, he's someone to reckon with.  But as a total writer, he needs a bit of help.  Still, this is a good history lesson.	2001-04-05

But I waited to read this, suspecting that something would be missing.<br />It is.  But it's not merely the lack of exciting characters.  The plots in this series are rather weak, and feel like warmed-over Next Gen.  The hero of the series, Mackenzie Calhoun, shows signs of being more than the two-dimensional former wunderkind he is here, and some other aliens are quite intriguing.  I especially liked the Thallonian ambassador.  But most of the cast is rather flat - Robin Lefler is as dull as she was when young Wynona Judd played her, Cmdr. Shelby shows little of the spark we saw on Next Gen, and we can really do without the overly titillating hermaphrodite engineer and Worfish security officer.<br />Other little things alot hinder the book, such as PAD's literal use of &quot;the Great Bird of the Galaxy&quot; and the transformation of Edward Jellico from a somewhat annoying but capable officer into a complete jerk.  <br />PAD's Trek novels always entertain, but this one fails to do much more than set up a series.  Without the visuals of the TV shows, this is more a storybaord than a story.  It could make a great Trek TV series, but it's not much of a novel.	2001-01-29

And its value as entertainment is quite high as Ebert selects from his years of reviews and offers insights into some of the worst films ever.<br />I consider Ebert - the columnist, but not the TV version - to be the best of the mainstream critics (the ones who don't pick and chose and write about eight films a year for New Yorker).  Reviewing bad films in a good way shows his strengths.  Granted, you don't have to buy this to read many of these reviews - his Web site has a pretty good archive going back to 1985.  But it's worth it just for the fun.  As you read it, take note of which actors and directors appear in more than one flop - yes, Bruce Willis, I'm talking to you!  See if you agree with him about those films you saw.

There's probably more history to the Batman than one mass market book could ever handle, but Les Daniels comes as close as anyone is ever likely to get to telling the whole story.  While Les does race through huge chunks of Batman's career - barely mentioning such important writers as Doug Moench and Marv Wolfman, and not mentioning Don Newton and many other artists - he presents the big picture very well.  The wide array of interviews are impressive - how often does Michael Keaton talk about Batman? - and the honest assessment of Batman's mucked-up life during the 1950s and 60s makes Daniels' appreciation of what came later all the more convincing.<br />Credit is also due to designer Chip Kidd, and to the myriad who helped make the book possible.  Want to see Batman collectibles?  They're all here, from the early days to the present.  How about a story?  Three classic Batman tales, including one by Bruce Timm, are here, too.<br />This book is a treat for Batman fans, and will fill in the blanks for those who just tuned in, and who wonder why us &quot;old-timers&quot; keep talking about Kathy Kane and Ace the Bathound.  No-fans will get a kick out of the art and should enjoy the glimpse into what makes a legend most.	2000-12-07

Trouble is afoot, and William DeWorde is going to get tot he bottom of it, with or without the help of the Watch, and with the help of a Rosalind Russell-esque Girl Friday and a vampire with an iconograph.<br />Everything but the plot clikcs perfectly after a fairly slow start.  The plot is a bit familiar - perhaps echoing &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; a bit too much - but the characters and naarative make up for it.  Willaim DeWorde is a welcome addition to the family of colorful residents of Ankh-Morpork, and Vetinari, Reg Slant, and Sam Vimes are also along for the ride.<br />This is not quite the book that &quot;Jingo&quot; or &quot;Men at Arms&quot; is, but it's fun, fast-paced, and clever in the ways that things by Pratchett should be.  Plus, it has the added bonus of lacking too many silly jokes or silly wizards (I don't like the wizrds much).  But it, and read it fast!	2000-12-03

Happily, my memories were quite correct.<br />This book continues what Adams started in the first book, using the bulk of the second half of the first radio drama and a huge, fascinating second plot from the second (otherwise forgotten) radio series.  While we follow Arthur Dent, slowly gaining a measure of ability to deal with the insanity in his life, we shift to watch Zaphod Beeblebrox complete the mission he himself set for Zaphod without the current Zaphod's knowledge.  The two plots are much stronger and provide a strong hook for all of Adams' humor from which to hang.<br />As the book goes along, Adams' command of the language sharpens and his tone becomes less jokey even when telling a joke.  The result is a work that is funny but sober, philosophical witohut being pedantic.<br />I just wish that Zaphod, so impressive an anti-hero, had a part to play in the other HGTG books.	2000-10-30

The humor and style are still there.  I still wish that I could writing as wittily as Douglas Adams.  The plot, however, begins to crumple after too many re-examinations.  So do the characters.  Arthur Dent just isn't that exciting a hero.  This book is best considered as a clever satire on sci-fi conventions and on the world at large.<br />Why have I found this beloved book to be wanting?  Perhaps it's exposure to some of Adams' later works, where plot plays more of a role and where characters come to life more (I think - next up will be a return to the second HGTG book and to Zaphod's harrowing adventures).  Perhaps it's the bitter taste left by the fourth and fifth books in the series, written by someone who didn't care anymore.  And perhaps it's exposure to the works of Terry Pratchett, Adams' equivalent in the fantasy genre.  Whereas Adams was content in this book to simply have fun making fun, Pratchett develops some of the most intriguing heroes and villains and ordinary people and makes you feel at home on the Discworld, which is really just a good metaphor for our world.  Adams doesn't really seem to like people that much, but Pratchett does.<br />Still, any sci-fi fan or fan of Monty Python should give this and its first two sequels a try.  Adams is a great wordsmith, and his departure from novels for other pastures is a bit of a loss.	2000-10-27

Michael White concentrates on filling the gaps in Newton's personal life - mainly focusing on all his feuds but also offering unprovable speculation about a relationship with another man and with a widow - but offers little insight into the science.  It's as if White assumes everyone understands how gravity works and what calculus is.  There's little here that shows me how great a scientist Newton was, but too much to tell me that he was not much of a human.<br />There is also the author's contention that Newton's extensive dabblings in alchemy directly influenced his success as a thinker.  Little evidence offered by White backs this up.  White also undermines himself by connecting Newton's alchemy and Newton's unorthodox but deeply-felt Christian beliefs, thereby joining the far-too-long list of science writers who denigrate religion along the way to worshipping at the feet of Science.<br />Beyond all that, this book is competently written if wordy.  White clearly needs Gribbin's help to succeed as a biographer.	2000-10-24

Great character play, sharp historic details - with a couple of odd exceptions - and top-notch art by Smith make this a must-read for super-hero comics readers.  In addition, it's fairly accessible for newer readers since most of the stars of this comic are not that well-known and thus made accessible for once.<br />Much has been said about &quot;Marvels&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; as being the best comics of the 1990s.

If you have even a passing interest in Batman or the Joker, you can read this and not be too lost.  Just don't share this one with your kids.

While knowing the backstory helps and while the three issues of The Flash includes spell most of it out, I think anyone who likes superheroes or action comics or teen sitcoms or just good stories will like Impulse's adventures.<br />DC has had great success with its reimagining of the classic teen heroes - Superboy, Robin and this one - and it's hard not to be hooked even if you are an adult.

And that's what we get.  Gould's choice of topics and command  of the subjects is - with some small but notable exceptions - superb.  He  is clearly a renaissance man, and his humanistic approach to science is  enjoyable to read and thought-provoking.<br />However, some of his essays  really needed editing, and one piece on some geological minutae once again  proves how dull a topic geology can be.  His liberal POV matches mine, but  he's yet another scientist sho can't find one nice thing to say about  religion.  And we don't need any essays from him on baseball.  I love  baseball too, but I don't read science books to read about Joe DiMaggio any  more than I read Mike Lupica to learn about Einstein.

While Kodiak is  part of the story, this is Bridgett's book and Rucka makes this loud,  brassy, somewhat vioelnt femme into a far more intriguing hero than Kodiak  could ever be.  The plot is a little thin in spots, but it's really an  excuse to explore where Logan came from and why she's the way she is.   There are moments when I couldn't stop reading and monents where it got so  intense that I had to.  The only major flaw with the book is that Rucka  doesn't quite know how to end it.

He runs away from the real world, moves into a house most  of us could never afford, and glorifies the life of the idle semi-rich.   <br />Despite a good writing style, Mayle fails to make this book accessible  to those of us whose lives are not about leisure time and food.  I wonder  if this man ever for one second realizes just how condescending he is, or  how out of touch his snotty way of life has gotten.

It provides a strong and concise  overview of Naziism and advances the disturbing but plausible idea that  World War II was intended in part as a cover for the Holocaust to come.  It  offers a chilling look inside the ghettos of Eastern Europe and shows how  wretched life was and also how life didn't stop immediately despite the  horrors heaped upon the Jews.  Where she forcuses her attention, she  provides a strong and complete overview.<br />However, the book stops at the  gates of the death camps and at the western boundaries of Germany.  While  an appendix touches on the fate of all of Europe's Jews, the body of the  work leaves out the progression of atrocities in Western and Southern  Europe.  Maybe there was little to say as most of the Jews ended up in the  ghettos but she doesn't make it clear till the appendix.  And she makes no  effort to talk about like in the labor camps or death camps.  While there  was little to talk of but doom and the barest hope of survival, many books  since have covered this topic, so I wonder why she didn't.<br />Still, this  work makes an excellent overview to the Holocaust, to the inhumanity of the  Germans, and to the efforts, no matter how small, by the Jews to never  surrender.	2000-08-16

I love works of history.  But I cannot stand this work.  As much I enjoy comics, they are inappropraite to use for such  horrific things as the Holocaust.  Spiegelman then makes things worse with  his cat-mouse-pig allegory.  I'm offended that he sees Jews as mice, and  wish he had used humans as humans.  It doesn't help that he's a lousy  artist.  But to reduce the Holocaust to a comic book?  It's so trivial.<br />I  also cannot stand Spiegelman, and the psychobabble he throws in about  himself and his relations with his father and wife are close to repugnant  and self-serving as well.  He's a mediocrity, a man who lambastes Judaism  and the comic book super-heroes I love with regularity, who thinks he's so  great, and who then points at the topic matter and screams, &quot;this is  ART!&quot;<br />I suppose if anyone learned about the Holocaust from this when  they wouldn't have otherwise, it's a worthwhile product, and maybe it's a  good thing that it helped to bring the idea of a comic book so respect.  But history, especially this history, demands a much more serious treatment  and a much less arrogant historian.<br />Adults who want to read about the  Holocaust needn't waste their brain cells on this when there is so much out  there.  Comc book fans are better off just reading a good old silly  super-hero book for fun and then trying real literature afterwards for the  history.  There are many more worthwhile ways to learn about the horrors of  the Holocaust without reading this.	2000-08-08

US	50775744	R1IYQ05GG9UFOY	0312198930	279681961	Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Very Readable If a Bit Redundant and Long	There's no question that Arthur C. Clarke is one of the great intellects of the past 100 years, or that his contributions to science and science  fiction are immense, or that he can really write.  So a book of this sort  is completely welcome, and the range of topics this work covers, from the  visions of the future past writers offered to the role of technology in the  world, is notable by itself.<br />For the most part, the essays live up to the  promise of the premise.  Clarke is sharp, funny and generally optimistic.   I could have done without the handful of instances where he dismisses  religion - why do all sci-fi writers seems to have it in for those of us  who still believe in a kind and active God? - but he's not intemperant or  intolerant of the differences that make up the world.  If all the critics  of this world were like Clarke, we'd e in much happier shape.<br />Two things  hurt this book, though.  One is the numerous essays about Clarke's  adventurues as a deep-sea diver in Sri Lanka.  I know that he's proud of  his days doing this, but I found such essays both dull and out of place  next to the rest of the book.  Never mind that I am disappointed that none  of his essays address the ongoing cilvil wars in his adopted  homeland.<br />The other trouble is the redundancy of the essays.  One essay  about computers includes the entire body of another essay in this book.   Several observations are repeated, such as the quip about the Apollo 8  astronauts and the monolith (it's funny once, but not three times).  If the  book could include new intros and closings to the essays, certainly they  could have been edited for the package.<br />In any case, though, this is a  worthwhile work to read and enjoy if you're a fan of Clarke's works, or a  fan of sci-fi, or a space buff, a technology watcher, or just want to see  how some of the great ideas of the past century were born.  Clarke gave us  the communications satellite, HAL, and an unqiue view of what is and what  might be.	2000-08-02
US	50775744	R20FCKMVJB19KL	0345303067	940144736	2010: Odyssey Two	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Very good book, but believe it or not, the movie was better	Having recently rewatched the under-rated Peter Hyams adpatation while also reading a book of Clarke's essays, I was inspired to read this.  Clarke is one of the most accomplished and intelligent science fiction  writers around, a man whose work is very heavy on what's possible and  thankfully light on psuedo-science.  But this book, while very entertaining  and readable, lacks very much in the way of tension.  Oddly, adding the  now-dated Cold War subplot to the film was what this book needed to really  move.<br />Is it fair to compare book to film when each has a slightly  different goal?  Probably not, but the film points out that Clarke is a  science writer as much as he is a fiction writer.  The meticulous care he  takes with facts slows the book down in a few places, and lack of tension  creates as happy a family aboard the Leonov as you could find on the  Enterprise.  Clarke is such an utopian that his world could be a little  duller than we would want for fiction.<br />That said, this is still a fun and  intelligent novel which offers a realistic vision of the future, and which  helps make some sense of the incomprehensible final 15 minutes of Kubrick's  bizarre masterwork..  What's more, I might even try to read the original  2001 novel to see if Clarke can do with words what Kubrick fails to do with  3 hours of slow-moving pictures.	2000-07-24

This books is better than the three stars I give it but certainly not a four-star thriller like &quot;The Ax.&quot;<br />The plot, clearly a riff on &quot;Strangers on a  Train&quot; is rather clever and I never quite know where's it's going.   But then it just gets there, and ends.  I feel like Westlake needs another  30 pages to build up to that ending - can he borrow a few from Stephen King  next time? :)<br />A lot rings trues about the lead characters, and Westlake  doesn't spend too much time talking about the intricacies of writing and  publishing (a flaw in far too many books about writers).  But I don't feel  like the big payoff matches the set-up.  This is a more enjoyable book in  many ways than &quot;The Ax&quot; - it lacks the darker edge of Westlake's  surprisingly sharp political commentary - but i just wish it went somewhere  more interesting.	2000-07-14

I'm never really sure why Dexter has Morse go through the hoops he  does here, or how exactly the case is solved.  Perhaps this is why Dexter  is wrapping this up as he seems to have little new left to say.  Morse also  seems a bit too out of character for the first half of the book, only  becoming the man we know and love closer to the end.<br />Still, even a weak  Morse novel is a treat, and Dexter's deft and surprisingly light touch  keeps things moving briskly.  Moreover, this is a Lewis novel, and the much  put-upon Watson of the series has his best hour.  I hope that Dexter starts  something new, maybe even a non-crime novel, so we won't be long without  his skills.  He's my favorite contemporary mystery novelist, one who rarely  lets the bleakness of the world consume the reader, as happens too often in  PD James' novels.<br />if you want to read a superior Morse book, try Walk  Through the Woods or The Wench is Dead, both of which are quite  unconventional.	2000-07-09

Robinson was writing the &quot;memoirs&quot; of his marvelous DS9 character, I figured it was another SF vanity project like the TekWar books or the like.  Surprisingly, Robinson not only  understands Elim Garak but also fleshes out Cardassia a lot more than any  writer at DS9 did.  He creates a world that is both believable and  alien.<br />There are flaws, such as the reason Garak was exiled to DS( and  the amount of guilt that Garak feels for Cardassian misdeeds in the past,  but this is a very good read and better than most of the Trek books I've  read.  Carey, Gray, and most of the rest have nothing on this  &quot;amateur&quot;.	2000-06-27
US	50775744	RAH7EPXSKJ8T8	067102423X	85988614	Bag of Bones	Books	3	3	5	N	N	OK King	After reading &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; I was ready to believe again that Stephen King can do no wrong, but this overly long, dour novel reminds me of why I went a decade between King books.  As the quote from the NY  Times review aptly notes, King can't make up his mind if this is serious  fiction or horror.  Or maybe he just can't quite get the two styles to mesh  the way he has in the past.<br />There are some good bits here, but the  mystery of Mike Noonan's summer home is never quite brought into focus and  the tension of the custody battle over poor Kyra Devore gets swallowed up  by the horror story.  I think Mr. King would have been better off just  writing horror or just leaving horror behind this time.<br />Still, there are  worse ways to spend a summer's day than reading this.	2000-06-20

And while seeing the reactions of the DS9 cast to this dystopia is very  intriguing, the plot doesn't fill up the pages.  Clearly, it's more set-up  for the third book than anything else.  There's also a huge flaw in that  the fall of the forces of good is brought about in part by a new and  mysterious alien race.  This smacks of Deus ex Machina and is unsatisfying  as never learning anything about the Breen on the TV show.<br />Still, if you  want to see our heroes in action again and to see just how Garak reacts to  the end of the world, read on.  It's certainly a lot of fun, in a very dark  way.	2000-06-05

There is almost no way we could ever guess the  identity of the murderer as the book is full of red herrings.  The  atmosphere of Victorian England is recreated nicely but almost none of the  characters come to life and ther are too many famous people romaing around  to give the book any focus.<br />There's just barely enough here to make me  perhaps try another in the series on a lazy sumer day, but not for a while.	2000-05-31

But The Reeves-Stevenses wrote two of my favorite Trek books, Federation and  Prime Directive, and I knew they would not let me down.<br />They didn't.  The  intricacies of the plot are sparkling and some of the character play,  especially involving Quark, echoes the TV show perfectly.  Not everything  is perfect -Dr. Bashir and Worf are a bit flat, and O'Brien's usual  blandness gets in the way - but this is a very ggod, exciting and  surprisingly quick read.  A treat for Trekkies like myself who miss DS9 or  for those who read the Shatner books because they were the real writers.	2000-05-22

So we get a very mixed bag.  While  stories by Simon Brett and Edward Hoch and Shirley Jackson stand out,  others by acclaimed writers like Rex Stout and Ellery Queen fall flat.   Some tales, especially one by Jack London, are barely readable, and the  choice of Sherlock Holmes story for this anthology is uninspired.  Still,  most of what's here is entertaining and the good stuff begs for me to find  more by the better writers.	2000-05-17

But I gave upabout halfway through what should have been much more fascinating andreadable.  Instead, Daniel Levy writes a rather dull portrait ofCohen, making him into just another hoodlum.  There's no verve or excitement here, despite the criminal life Cohen leads in Canada or the revolutions he sees in China.  It also doesn't help that this book is rife with bad grammar and sentence structure.  Didn't anyone edit this?<br />A dull book all the way to the point when I said, &quot;enough!&quot; END	2000-05-03

Leon Wieseltier has created a singular work, exploring 2,000 years of Jewihs tradition and thought about death and mourning in the aftermath of his own father's death.  The breadth of his knowlegde is amazing, and all  the more so given that he is something of a non-believer.  As a religious  Jew, I found his discoveries and his re-examination of his own faith to be  moving.<br />The work has two flaws.  The first is its length.  And while you  can excuse its length as being a product of the vast amount of lore and law  he sifted through, he occasionally rambles and jumps off the topic.<br />The  other flaw is that I just can't iamgine too many people wanting to read  this.  If you're more devout than I, you might find his agnosticism  offputing.  If you're of a secular bent or not Jewish, why would you want  to read this at all?  That such a work got published is a sign that Jewish  philosophy is part of the mainstream.  But I wonder how many people are  like myself and have the patience and curiosity to dive into this book.   Maybe it should have been more accessible.  Or maybe it's best that some  books make the readers work to learn something, the way the author did in  writing this.<br />If you are of the right patience and of the right religous  bent, however, tead this and cherish its beauty.	2000-03-30

If all you know about the Hulk is what you saw on TV - on any of the cartoons or on the old Bill Bixby show - forget everything and start over here.  Peter David, who reinvented the Hulk for Marvel Comics prior to  writing this book, crafts a heartwrenching story about a man cursed to see  his own worst angel in the mirror every day, the owman who loves him, and  the evil that may lurk within both his mind and his DNA.<br />If you've read  PAD's Trek novels, try this.  It's even better than those, as he takes a  character he has made his own and makes him incredible.  And after this,  you'll never thing of the Hulk and Lou Ferrigno in the same sentence again.	2000-03-22

The character insights that PAD usually provides in  even his lighter Trek books are missing, as is (for the first time ever!)  his sense of humor.  We get a bland Worf, a bland Deanna, and a rather  bland Sela (Yar's Romulan child).  Only the two Rikers - Will and his  photocopy Tom - have nay personality at all.  What's more, the plots behind  the characters are dull, a letdown following the cosmic adventures PAD gave  us in &quot;Imzadi,&quot; &quot;Q-Squared&quot; and even &quot;The  Captain's Daughter.&quot;<br />I don't what happened to Peter.  I would say  he's been edited to death in this novel.  But regardless of why this is so  bland, it is just not worth buying.  Find it a library instead, and don't  expect anything more than an average episode of Trek.	2000-03-22

It's a fun read, not much more, but mixes two popular pastimes, baseball and amateur sleuthing, quite well.  This book is like a day at the park: slow in some  places, intriguing at others, relaxing at the right moments, and full of  history and spark and pep.  And it takes less time to read than most games  take to play now.<br />Soos is not a great writer, but he does what he sets  out to time and again.  If you love old-time baseball, or mysteries, read  this.  And even if you just love baseball, read this.  The mystery is less  important than the sense of love and passion Soos brings to Rawlings and  his real and fictional baseball cohorts.	2000-03-13

This is for the most part a page-turner.  His description of the 1927 flight, of the night of the kidnapping and of the events leading up to the trial are very well done.   <br />However, this is two books.  The first book, about Lindbergh up till the  trial, is superb and captures the greatness of the man's accomplishments  and the limitations of the man.  The second book, about the trial, the  isolationist and the husband, is much less substantial.  It glosses over  the revisionist versions of the the trial - which might be too complex for  this already long book - and downplays Lindbergh's anti-Semitism and his  swift rehabilitation far too readily.<br />I've come away seeing that Lindy  was a hero for his flight and for the role he played in opening the skies.   I'm also more interested in reading more about that era.  But I'm more  convinced than before that Lindbergh forfeited his exalted status and that  he was an anti-Semite.  Berg chooses not to address this head-on, and  undermines his credibility as a historian.  I wonder if anyone has written  about the Jewish community and America First to set the record to balance  for me.<br />At the same time, he brings Anne Lindbergh to life very well and  I hope to red her recent biography.  I would actually like to give his  version of history 2 1/2 stars but his bio of the people a 4.  The 3 is a  compromise.<br />And I do like readers the mix of views this book has  inspired, even from the more dedicated readers.  Ain't amazon.com great?	2000-03-07

Now he has written a novel that doesn't try to be  a comic in disguise.  He brings the characters to life, brings the  hyperbole of the comics under control, and provides a textbook on how to  turn comics into novels.<br />The question is, who's going to read this?   Rucka's fans certainly should, as should Bat-fans of all stripes.  If you  like good SF or good crime fiction, give this a try.	2000-02-28

Harris's skills have become a parody of themselves as he indulges in every kind of flowery speech.  And there's not one likeable character  here, especially poor Clarice Starling.

The premise of Batman vs. the Mob at the start of his career is intriguing, as are the characters and  the way Jeph Loeb handles the Batman.  However, the gimmick of a series of  holiday-related murders forces Loeb to write too long a tale, one that  could have been two or three issues shorter without sacrificing much.  A  red herring linking Bruce Wayne to the mob also goes nowhere, and some of  the villains who show up are less suited to this noirish tale than  others.<br />Tim Sale's art is stylized to good effect, and Gregory Wright's  limited color palette combines with the art to create a noir comic of the  likes not seen since Miller and Mazuchelli's Batman: Year One.  However,  the stylization serves some characters better than others, and the Joker is  a bit too garish.<br />On the whole, this is an above average Bat-book that  strives to tell a complete story built around the three pillars of Batman,  Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  But compared with both the recent &quot;No  Man's Land&quot; saga and other, shorter Bat-epics, this is a bit  disappointing until the last 60 or so pages.<br />Simon DelMonte	2000-01-10
