There were too many unanswered questions concerning most of the characters. We should have had more background information on such characters as Stacey. She was a well off accountant, how did she meet Ace and why was she with him? We need the scoop on Rick, the so called best friend. He bedded Keisha, Ace's ride or die chick.

On a trip home from college, Nyzera finds out that after being married for fourteen  years, her parents are going through a divorce. She first gets one side of the story from her mother and then hears the other side from her father Vaughn, who she favors. She believes her father and blames her mother for the failed relationship. Meanwhile daddy has moved on and has a new ready made family he want Nzera to meet.<br /><br />Nyzera is receptive to Regina, daddy's girlfriend who is a criminal lawyer. When she meets Regina's son Tashan, she immediately wants him and feels that this may be the love she has been waiting for. Although Tashan also has feelings for her; but his main goal is to have Nyzera's father adopt him. After all, Vaughn has been like the father he never had for the past 20 years! Meaning daddy had been cheating on mother all this time! AND...Tashan wants Vaughn to be his father legally!<br /><br />So here's where the story heats up.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the whole story, but I have lots of questions to ask the author David Williams, who I met recently at a literary event.<br /><br />This book will definitely be up for discussion at one of our book club meettings!<br /><br />Basically, I like this fast paced story, but I felt that Nyzera's character could have been developed a lot more. This girl did not have any love for her mother. There was no mention of her friends until she felt she needed them, and she was ready to kick ass at the drop of a hat. As far as I am concerned there had to be a lot more to her personality than that rough exterior. Tashan's character seems to be a nice man but what did we really learn about him?<br /><br />The cover and title of this novel will get this book noticed and it is worth the read.

If you have one who is anything like the character Sasha throw her ass to the curb!! Then think about yourself; what kind of friend are you?<br /><br />Denise Campbell skillfully pens this story which brings to light a couple of things. The world is not as big as you may think it is, and what goes around comes back around.<br /><br />Envy, jealousy, sex and of course men, are the fuels that start this fire, which burns through the tight bond that once held these friends together. I was on the edge of my seat with this book and eventually in shock at the explosive end!<br /><br />Ms Campbell is a sharp writer who leaves nothing to the imagination.

But secretly daddy is raising the child as his own with his mistress! The sexy accountant, she has been cheating on her boyfriend Malik with, is her own flesh and blood!! This is some heavy stuff.....<br /><br />Portia is the name and this is her story. Born to Dr. William and Sylvia Davidson, Portia grew up watching her mother float around the house in an alcoholic haze. Her father was mostly absent from home busy covering up his sordid secrets.<br /><br />When Portia's mother dies suddenly, all the slimy little worms come crawling out of Dr Davidson's box of lies one by one. A slew of characters are affected by this man's selfish acts.<br /><br />Apart from some minor editing errors, I liked this story. It tells how lies and secrets can break a family or person apart. Some of those baby daddies out there who have multiple children with different baby mamas need to read this book. Incest is so close to a lot of our children today because some of them have brothers and sisters that go to the same school as them and don't even know it.<br /><br />I would love to see this story up on the big silver screen.

The story has a lot of layers which start to unfold as you get deeper into the book. All the characters were richly developed and added their own flavor to the story. I can honestly say I did not know what the out come of this book would be and I was pleasantly surprised. I did not like the rap versus (the story did'nt need so many of them) and too many brand name dropping!!!! I have a couple of questions for Mr McCalla but I will wait and ask him in an online chat. Otherwise I enjoyed the story. The book has an excellent cover and I am looking forward to Brandon's next book in the Diamond series.	2005-02-08

I ask myself why are people so obsessed with each other? and why do women do such crazy things for the men in their lives? These questions I cannot answer. Ms Hobbs did a great job with this story line. She builds on the suspense at a good pace, and then kicked it up a notch! I loved the nursing home setting and Ms Hobbs was on point with all the activity that goes on there. The cover of this book has a nice rustic look to it. You won't believe the dynamic ending!

You will get caught up in their lives as if you were living it. For me there is always one character that stands out in all her books, they usually do or say something that appeals to my heart. In \\"Driven\\" it was Ms Hurdly who gave Nasir some very good advice. Oh yes, \\"conclusion\\" is a word I forgot to mention. You will have to wait for the sequel \\"At the courts mercy\\" to get the conclusion. I could just see the gleam in her eyes as she is writing the last chapter, smiling to herself saying \\"let me leave them with something to talk about\\" and that she did.

Mr Dickey did a good job writing about one of the subjects he touch on in this book, and that was the child support issue. It is a shame some women use this issue just to get back at the men for leaving them, and it is mostly the good men who are willing to support their children that are put through this shameful ordeal.

I was not impressed by the cover or the title, which did not give much away. Narrated by a nameless male, the story is about two cousins who are paid to have sex with women as part of a blackmail scheme. But the elaborate plan starts to unreel when someone gets greedy and all hell breaks loose. Mr Frisby you've got rhythm. Your characters are true to life. You did not over power us with a lot of different personalities. You also stayed true to the storyline and the highlights came at decent intervals throughtout the book. I especially loved the climax to the story, that's what you call \\"art imitating life\\" or \\"pulled from todays headlines\\". Yes this book is worth the price. I will be looking out for \\"wifebeater\\" in 2005.	2004-10-10

The book depicts where the life of a hustler can lead him. It also gives an inside veiw of how lonley a hustler's wife can be. Which if she truly loves her man, can be a very lonley life without him. Suave and Sincere are the couple who are put to the test. They are forced to live apart after Suave receives a three year prison sentance for defending himself against a robber. Ultimately their love is tested. Will Suave drive himself crazy wondering what the love of his life is doing while he is locked up? Will Sincere be strong without her man to lean on? or will she get weak and stray? Buy the book and find out. \\"No Exit\\" and \\"Block Party\\" are Mr Banks previous books, \\"Sincerely Yours\\" being the third book in his \\"True 2 Life Street Series\\". All three books are excellent reads. \\"Sincerely yours\\" concludes questions that were unanswered in the first two books. The design of the cover is eye catching and fits right in with the plot. Only one thing Mr Banks...The book lost credibility upon its conclusion...That was definitely a NO, NO. So you only get four stars.	2004-10-10

Iam now reading his other book \\"Pretenses\\" which apparently was his first book before \\"Sugar & Spice\\", but Iam confused about the marketing strategy that Keith and his team used for these two books. Why did \\"Sugar & Spice\\" come out before \\"Pretenses\\"? Keith please feel free to contact me with an answer!	2004-09-23

Relentles Aaron attacks this novel like a champion boxer defending his own title! \\"Our honor\\" has graced the literary kingdom once again with this suspenseful, ruthless and cunning psycho drama \\"Triple Threat\\".

Needless to say I read the book in one day.<br /><br />April, River and Sissy are the stars in this book. Their story of murder, sex and identity problems will have you on the edge of your chair. (No plot give-a-way here!) You will laugh at times and other times you will gasp at some of the things these torched souls do, but by the end of the book you will understand what links these women together. A job will done.	2004-09-18

We get a good inside look at the beauty industry with all the \\"air kissing\\". The author Tia Williams did a superb job with the character Jay Lane\\"s background I felt Jay was a strong character we could all fall in love with. Maybe Tia should consider writing another story about him. Pandora/Tammy is the girl from Jay's past who is secretly in love with him and the poor guy is too blind to see it! Tia Williams expertise in the beauty industry has proved to be an asset in her writing of this story.	2004-09-13

Cosmopolitan Girls is about the lives and friendship between two girls living and working in New York City. When they meet, each believe the other's life is better than her own but they each<br /><br /> get a wake up call!<br /><br /> This story is fast, fun and emotional. I wanted to kick the video director &quot;Troy&quot; where it hurts the most! He is such a jerk! He is the type of man every mother should warn her daughter about! I liked that Lindsay finally learned that &quot;Women have the power to heal each other through friendship&quot; This is a true statement. I only wish more young women would try to look for friendship in other women instead of being jealous or putting them down.	2004-07-25

Tasha, Rodney and Octavia are the fithgraders coming of age during the time of the Atlanta child murders. Each tell of the trials and tribulations at home, school and during their personal time. There is sadness, fear and tears especially when children they know start disapearing! It was fun to read what the children thought about their parents and teachers, it took me back to my own childhood. Octavia is my favorite out of the three. She seemed wise beyond her years. Tayari Jones did a great job but I felt the story could have gone on for a while longer. I got emotionally attached to the kids and wanted to know how their lives turn out. Over all this book was very good.	2004-04-30
