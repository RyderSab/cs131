I never thought that a twenty year old book in marketing, a field which ages rapidly, could maintain its relevance. After all, if we were nearly drowning in sea of information in the 80's, we are in riding a tidal wave in the midst of a hurricane, hanging on for dear life now. But this book is probably even more relevant now than it was then. <br /> <br />The basic tenant of this short, easy to read but brilliant book is straight forward enough: to be noticed in an over-communicated society, a brand must firmly hold a place (position) in a consumer's mind. Sure, that is relatively easy if you are #1 in a field. After all, Kleenex becomes generic for tissue, Kotex for tampons. But, if you cannot be there first, look for a `hole,' a niche not exploited by the market leader. As in strategy, it is easier to hit superior forces where they're not instead of head on. Think of Dell. Instead of fighting HP and Compaq for shelf space in Best Buys and Circuit City, it went whole-hog into direct sales. Now, it holds that niche pretty firmly. <br /> <br />However, the authors warn against a positioned brand diluting a clear `value position' by meaningless line extensions. That has been the demise of many brands, and the authors point out several. <br /> <br />Lastly, I like the fact that the authors also turn the ideas on themselves a little, and insert a chapter on positioning yourself. Sound career advice. Keep your brand positioned: strong, pure, and undiluted. This will definitely help you (and me!) manage our careers. <br />	2004-10-21

Visionary companies, on the contrary, embrace the power of \\"and:\\" You can preserve the core AND stimulate progress. <br /> <br />That said, the authors go on to describe how great companies build structures that embrace these often contradictory goals. The great companies Collins and Porras study, contrary to popular belief, are not profit focused at their core. Instead, they are `value' focused. These values are a sort of nucleus, around which leaders in visionary companies grow the company.  <br /> <br />And that is not the only difference between visionary companies and the more average comparison companies. The visionary companies surveyed consistently produced leaders steeped in the company's ideology. These home grown leaders are the result of deliberate corporate design, an orientation to corporate structure that the authors call \\"clock building instead of time telling.\\" In short, among the final products of visionary companies are competent leaders that carry on the core. And once developed, these leaders are then encouraged to experiment boldly, keeping only what works (i.e. what is effective and in alignment with the core). <br /> <br />A very entertaining book, it is among the best, easiest to follow guide to strategy imaginable. I also like the fact that it addresses not only macro level concerns, but also provides guidelines to help folks like me, stuck in middle management positions, apply these concepts. It is well written, the case studies compelling, and I like being able to follow the authors' research methods in the appendices. It is this thorough research which raises the book several notches above the now-classic \\"In Search of Excellence.\\"<br />	2004-10-21

Focus groups, customer surveys and CRM/ One-to-One technologies are growing increasingly common.     Jensen takes this one-step further. Why not build a company that is easy for the front-line employees, who actually interface with your customers, to navigate? A common-sense, win-win scenario. The customers of a simplified business would happier because employees have relevant information at their finger-tips. Employees are happier because they save thousands of frustrating hours spent looking for the exact information they need. Indeed, Jensen advocates turning traditional strategy on its head.  He foresees easy-to-navigate companies built from the ground up, merely overseen by executive \\"steering committees.\\"     Easy-navigation is what Jensen calls \\"Simplicity.\\"  In fact, taming complexity by taking time to sift the important from the trivial grows more vital, and difficult to do, as our businesses grow larger. Because of this, most companies fall quite short when it comes to providing their employees with the tools needed to simply do their jobs. And Jensen does not stop at the theoretical, big-picture level, but presents some excellent tools to help think through these problems:  \\"CLEAR,\\" and \\"Simpler to Know, Feel, Use, Do and Succeed\\" are a couple of the most noteworthy.     Though I love Jensen's ideas, I have one major criticism: the book is, quite ironically, one of the most difficult to navigate books I have ever encountered. Side bars cut into text, without any warning, change in text font or background color. Two or three times each chapter, you are left hanging mid-sentence in the main text, while you read a related side-bar... only to forget what the main sentence was talking about. In fact, this caused me to shave the rating from five stars for the content to four for the entire package... and almost had me to three. I found the navigation that frustrating.    Still, I wouldrecommend this book to almost everyone I know in business. The ideas are that good.	2004-10-15

I plop the covers shut, and jump up feeling pumped, filled with ideas and bubbling over with enthusiasm. Unfortunately, on Monday, I still have to face the work-a-day world. <br /> <br />This book was no different. Indeed, it is one of his best. I love his ideas about decentralization and finding talent in everything work endeavor (Michelangelo's of housekeeping? Props, says the author). Building WOW! projects (any project can be WOW! if we let it), and resume-ing those projects to manage your career as a Professional Service provider. In short, how to brand yourself, how to grow that brand value, and ultimately leverage your talents through that brand. <br /> <br />This book, however, does not stop at the personal Buzz level. It touches on corporate restructuring to flatter, faster entities ... and the fact that the \\"nerds have won!\\" Peters points out that grey matter is becoming increasingly more important than lumpy things. For example, examine Nike, Microsoft and Oracle versus Ford. One sells stuff, the others sell ideas. Those industries highest in grey-matter consistently show the highest ROE. <br /> <br />I love this book, though not directly applicable like most excellent business books. In fact, I would caution anyone wanting to manage from Peters' un-tempered ideas.  <br /> <br />For example, Peters lauds Nike throughout this book. But, check out how poorly Nike faired in the late 90's, early 2000's. Consumers, unawares to the company's executives, changed fashion trends away from white leather sport shoes and towards causal, brown natural leather shoes. At the same time, the company's lumbering supply chain made its core accounts (the sporting goods stores) very unhappy as they faced constant stock outages. And, when you add the public fervor over its sweat-shops in Asia, well ... Sometimes, it pays to be sober to temper over-exuberance. \\"A cup of decaf, please.\\" <br /> <br />Everything aside, Peters is one-in-a-million. He continuously points me to the future, and gets my juices flowing. Sort of like a Michelangelo of biz-speak: the reigning king of biz-Chaos.  <br />	2004-10-15

Winning companies all have many things in common. Mostly, this is what Collins and Porras call \\"clock building\\" in \\"Built to Last:\\" designing an organizational architecture that grows, and maintains its integral core despite the changes in internal people and external strategies. \\"What Really Works\\" talks you through some of the steps necessary to make that clock. First, listen to what the customer wants. Then make filling that need your strategic focus. Make that value offering clear. Ensure that your controls and systems are top notch, so that employees can execute the strategy. Align the culture and organizational structure so performance is rewarded, again supporting the strategy. Once these major criteria are fulfilled, you can begin to think about secondary practices, namely developing people and leaders, keeping talent and innovating.  <br /> <br />I am truly split on this Joyce and Nohria's work. It is well written and easy to read. I also like the companies presented in case studies. These weren't your typical 3M/GM/IBM/Dell case studies, but Nordstrom, Nike, and the Limited. Sort of warms my heart not to have to read the history behind Post-It-Notes for the 5000th time. But, I also have some serious issues with the book.  <br /> <br />A former science geek in my undergrad years, I love precision. I like the thoroughness that the authors IMPLY went into the Evergreen Project. I say IMPLY, because, unlike Collins and Porras in \\"Built to Last,\\" the authors do not tell us anything about their research methods. They also claim to have combed the literature and statistically eliminated all but eight of 200+ popular management practices. What were those 200+ practices? How did the Evergreen team research companies for the presence or absence of said practices? An appendix of research practices and results would be nice. <br /> <br/>Weaknesses aside, I recommend this book on two counts. First of all, because I truly get the impression that there is some serious research behind the premises. And, if you accept the premises, the \\"Further Reading\\" section, grouped by books relating to each of the core practices, is worth the price of the book.	2004-10-10

After being promoted to management, I needed to learn how to manage. And my company offered us three day's worth of training... hardly enough to really grasp the ins and outs of how to shape other's behavior. However, the most highly skilled of the presenters mentioned this book, and felt that behavioral modification was the only true key to managing effectively.    I scoffed initially.    Being a twentieth century American, I thought behaviorism was dead. Skinner struck me as cold ... but, being a scientific and open-minded man, I purchased the book. And I'm glad I did.    I can say this without batting an eye: because of Aubrey Daniels' book, not only are my teams consistently strong performing teams, I know how I got there. So, when I get a new batch of team members, I can apply the same principles, and see the results right away. In fact, learning about this book is the most useful thing I learned in that aforementioned week of leadership training.    What are Daniel's principles? First of all, that people do what they do because of reinforcement. Reinforcement comes in two main forms: positive and negative. Negative reinforcement does not necessarily mean punishment, but that positive reinforcement is withheld. Punishment is a subset of negative reinforcement, largely overused.     Daniels then goes on to show the \\"ABC's\\" of behavior (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequences), and illustrate why some behaviors are not easy to shape (the consequences are uncertain). Once you understand the basics, it becomes easy to look for opportunities to shape your reports' behaviors by rewarding what you want then to do ... making the UNCERTAIN consequence CERTAIN: \\"If I do this, my manager will be happy,\\" instead of the UNCERTAIN, \\"I am not sure if this will work... Will my peers scoff at me?...\\" Daniels finishes up with several insightful case studies about how his principles have been applied in the real world. This can give you solid ideas on how to apply them in your neck ofthe woods.      All told, one of the greatest, most practical, and easiest to use management books I've read. And, thanks to Skinner and a rash of behaviorists in the 50's and 60's, the most scientifically validated.	2004-09-25

After B-School and hundreds of business books, it took these 150 or so pages of text lay explain why I spent time learning finance and accounting, marketing, communications and leadership: To build my business acumen. And Mr. Charan makes it clear that business acumen drives all businesses, be they apple carts or multi-nationals.   <br /> <br />How simple is Charan's exposition on building business acumen? <br />-Finance and operations management are boiled down to one equation (R=M*V). As basic as it gets.  <br />-And marketing gets covered just as simply: \\"Do they like my fruit? If customers cleared me out of bananas but I have apples left, should I abandon apples and specialize in bananas?\\"  <br />- Leadership is getting people to focus on the important drivers of wealth generation: cash, velocity, and margins. The best leaders cut through the complexity of their businesses, and get their employees entirely focused on these fundamentals.  <br /> <br />But do not be fooled by the brevity. This book is actually quite rigorous. Of course, you will still need spreadsheets and inventory management software and SAS to mine data in this increasingly complex world. Charan does not deny this, but cuts through the complexity so you can see how it all fits together. And that is business acumen, the knowledge and understanding of which will enrich any job you do.  <br />	2004-09-23

Same with Lean: Kanban, Toyota, JIT. I am a manager in a professional services industry. So, outside of memorizing the theory for exams during B-School, I thought little more of Six-Sigma. <br /> <br />Michael George has opened my eyes. He points out (in a non-technical way) both the differences in Lean and Six Sigma, and how they complement each other. He does this through some description of the Lean and Six-Sigma techniques, and follows up with some revealing case studies, how Lean and Six-Sigma tools can apply to services. <br /> <br />Six-Sigma brings an awful lot to the table. Six-Sigma was the backbone of Jack Welch's eye-popping success at GE, shaving hundreds of millions off of the company's cost structure. A proscribed series of steps, Six-Sigma's customer focused methodology (DMAIC) allows the practitioner, generally referred to as Green or Black Belts, to rationally Define a problem, Measure it, Analyze the causes, make adjustments to Improve the problem, and ultimately Control the corrected process. In each of these steps, Six-Sigma deploys standard tools that help the practitioner ensure that processes are producing standardized outputs well within specs. The result, if implemented correctly, is higher quality output. Increased quality= less quality costs (scrap, customer returns) =increased margins. <br /> <br />Lean is largely managing processes to increase the velocity of them. Increased velocity means less work in process (WIP). Lean means determining which activities are value added, and which are not. Then, you get rid of the bathwater and keep the baby. <br /> <br />When the two methodologies are combined, you have greater velocity (product turns), less inventory in the pipeline and processes that build value for the customer (Lean Concepts). You also have measurable quality standards that are continually fine tuning the processes, honing in on fitting more and more perfectly the specs desired by consumers. This reduces quality costs dramatically (Six Sigma Concepts).  <br /> <br />George follows up with some interesting case studies of how Black and Green Belts have worked to improve processes in Lockheed-Martin, Bank One and, most interesting of all, the city of Fort Wayne, Indiana (Yes, Virginia, if there is rationality in government, there just may be a Santa Claus!). I would have liked to see more of the technical aspects: A case study from the problem definition phase through control, how the various Lean and Six Sigma tools were applied instead of the macro-level explanations of before and after. <br /> <br />I liked the book well enough. It gave me an overview, and an idea of how to implement the tools. However, I would have appreciated some down and dirty, nuts and bolts how-to. After all, the book jacket promises to teach you how to shave dollars from the bottom line. Still, an invaluable, thought provoking read for any manager in a service industry. You may want to pick up \\"Business Process Mapping\\" by Jacka and Keller, and \\"Statistics for Six-Sigma Made Easy\\" by Brussee to familiarize yourself with the nuts and bolts of Six-Sigma Quality tools. <br />	2004-09-22

But marketed as a business book? <br />Let me set some boudries, first of all, to show you how important I think the material is. If this was Doctor Suess- like book, marketed and written with my kids in mind, I would be cool: five stars easlily. If it was marketed as a self-help book for reframing your attitude, it would get four, maybe five stars. If it were a hippy/ new-age book about just being and enjoying life, five stars plus. <br />However, as a business book, it is pure fluff. <br />I was forced to watch this in a corporate setting. Instead of fostering honest, human fun amongst our workforce, it seemed like an invitation for many on the management staff to work on trivial activities. Using Covey's &quot;Seven Habits&quot; and &quot;First Things First&quot; language, they were spending their time in Quadrant 4 of the time management matrix (unimportant, not urgent), instead of the stewardship that comes from Quadrant 2 (important,not urgent).<br />And employees were ignored while these managers &quot;played,&quot; bringing in megaphones and making silly videos. If you want to find out about how to create good customer service, try &quot;Customers for Life,&quot; &quot;Raving Fans,&quot; or &quot;Hug Your Customers.&quot; If you want to motivate your workforce, &quot;The Streetwise Guide to Motivating and Rewarding Your Employees,&quot; or a reprint of the HBR article by Herzberg, &quot;Once Again, How do You Motivate Your Employees?&quot; is an excellent place to start. <br />This book, from my experience, will likely lead to the denial of serious issues, which are actually a blast to tackle in my experience.	2004-03-19

But trust me, it is worth it. I had to read it for a Management class, and it started of like a typical OB text, illustrating the history of management studies (Taylor to Maslow to Mayo to Likert to ...). Good stuff, but pretty dull. Then, Hersey et al went where most scholars, even the supposedly worldly MBA types, fear to tread: real-world application!<br />The text covers all of the material covered Blanchard's &quot;One Minute Manager,&quot; &quot;Putting the One Minute Manager to Work,&quot; and a shelf load of other books. It also does a great job introducing Blanchard and Hersey's Situational Leadership, where the manager matches leadership behavior to a report's ability level and motivation. This replaces &quot;Leadership and the One Minute Manager,&quot; and delves much deeper into the topic.<br />Hersey et al also cover:<BR>- Behavioral shaping, and positive and negative reinforcement quite nicely<BR>- Communications skills necessary to lead reports<BR>- Power building, and using effective power bases ...<BR>- The list literally goes on and on.<br />I use the concepts I was first exposed to here day in and day out. They work. My OB professor told us that, if he would be limited to just one book on management, he would choose this one. And, five years later, I agree. I am very glad that I did not sell this book back to the campus bookstore.

This is not Tom Peters ranting, nor is it the leadership secrets of the buffalo/Attila the Hun/sharks, or whatever the flavor of the week is. This is pure applied social science.<br />Though this book did not 'revolutionize' the way I manage, like Blanchard/ Hersey's 'Management of Organizational Behavior,' or Aubrey Daniels' 'Bringing Out the Best in People' did, this is a very useful book. It really illuminates the Blake/ Mouton Managerial Grid, and the Ohio State and Michigan studies that spawned the Grid, through clear, concrete examples. And this exposition is necessary, since these very important topics are usually glanced over in five pages in most Management/OB texts. <br />This book packs a ton of strategies for driving performance into its 225 pages. By sticking to scientifically sound principles, its recommendations appear right on track, placing just enough tension into the system to get results. As to its effectiveness, hit me up in a couple of months. However, as a down-to-earth, practical guy, I have a very strong gut feeling that the strategies in this book are right on target.	2004-01-11

However, I thought the book fell far short of the quality and rigor Blanchard's more popular works on management and team building. While Lyles' ideas work on some level, they seem to fall short when looked at analytically through tested and effective management models.<br />For example, \\"Make people feel good about themselves\\" sounds good on the surface. But what if someone is engaging in unacceptable behavior at work? The assertion \\"Make people feel good about themselves\\" is a weakened version of the very effective advice offered in the `One Minute Manager:' \\"Be tough on the problem, easy on the people.\\"<br />What about the advice to `build camels,' with consensus ideas being better than individual ideas? In my experience, a team's ideas are often better than an individual's. But, think of pork-barreled legislation, and camels seem less appealing; there is a little known clause in the Homeland Security Act that absolves drug companies currently producing the MMR vaccines, linked to childhood autism, from lawsuits springing from its faulty product. So, to vote against the bill because of this clause would make a senator seem un-American, even if it were a vote against pork-barreled protection for unethical drug companies.<br />I have loved Blanchard's ideas for years, and this one a rare exception to the team's typical excellence. For a better treatment of teamwork, pick up\\"Gung-Ho,\\"another book from the Blanchard management training mill.	2004-01-11

Blanchard and Johnson's One Minute method presented scientifically validated behavioral psychology in a way that managers of the time could feel comfortable with. Thus, if you apply these ideas, you will not sound like a psychologist circa 1950. Instead, you'll sound like a Politically Correct 1980's management consultant.<br />Despite its age, the method is simple -you can read it in half an hour- yet extremely powerful. First, define the behaviors or results you want (One Minute Goal Setting/ Activator), then let your reports go out and perform. During the performance, you offer reinforcement in two forms, positive or negative. Catch someone doing good, you give them a One Minute Praising (positive reinforcement). Catch a report doing something bad, you give them a One Minute Reprimand (punishment/ negative reinforcement). The result is classic operant conditioning and behavior shaping.<br />I use the concepts in this book regularly. They are simple and very effective. Once you know where you want people to go, the behavior shaping methods presented in this book will likely get your team there, and quickly. One Minute Managing is a surefire way to increase the quantity of actions which add value, while minimizing those which detract. I would recommend Aubrey Daniels' `Bringing out the Best in People,' which goes into operant conditioning in more depth, as a very solid companion for this book.	2004-01-11

Further, it is a how-to manual, which teaches you how to lead effectively using the model. You will learn: The development and intervention cycles, how to avoid being a \\"Leave `em alone, the zap `em\\" style manager, and how to properly empower a team, keeping control while simultaneously freeing people. You accomplish this by carefully modulating your relating and task-oriented behaviors in response to your report's motivationand skill. A proper match between employee readiness and a manager's approach generally leads to a more productive, harmonious work place.        This book is a classic. Along with the aforementioned text written by Paul Hersey and Ken Blachard (Of \\"One Minute Manager\\" fame), this book and Aubrey Daniels' behavioral modification how-to book, \\"Bringing the Best Out Of People\\" should be on every leader's bookshelf	2003-07-11

Until I realized that an arts and sciences degree and quarter will get you a cup of coffee.<br />So on to an MBA school to get me some real, practical education. <br />Most MBA schools require Econ as a prerequisite. I had the option to take the class, and spend several thousand dollars, or take two CLEP tests, one for Macro and one for Micro for seventy bucks a pop. You do the math.<br />I used Harper Collins' College Outline's Intro to Economics as my main text. I would recommended that book to anyone wanting to understand the subject. However, it has one serious drawback: No solved problems, or even problems to solve. <br />So I had to pick up this book, REA's Problem Solver in Economics, to complement it. The Problem Solver explains how to think through economics problems. I think both approaches (The expository HCO Intro and the hands-on Problems Solver) are necessary. However, this book can teach you economics all by itself. The explanations heading the chapters are lucid, easy to follow descriptions of the underlying theory. And the problems get into the nuts-and-bolts of thinking like an economist.<br />It is maybe a little advanced for some, but I am a math nerd, so appreciated the thoroughness. Everything considered, it was money well spent. Both books together cost less than half that of a standard text, and I understood econ better than your average bear in two months' time.	2003-02-22

Unlike many reviewers, I feel the book does transcend time. American people and culture today, computers and all, are a lot like those in Stendhal's 19th century France.<br /><br />The main characters strike me as real, and quite complex. Julien is a typical adolescent/ young adult: Idealistic, searching and unsure of himself. To me, it is amazing to what how the world interacts with and alters his self-image. Mathilde is equally interesting. She reminds me of a flighty alternative girl, looking for a dream of simmering romance. And MME de Renal is a wonderful, believable woman, falling in love late in life, victim of the missing husband syndrome. <br /><br />Like people today, Stedhal's characters are a bundle of contradictions. Is Julien a villain, an angel, a self-serving climber or a man truly in love, searching for his higher self? Aloof or loveable? Is MME de Renal a devout, moral patroness, devoted to her family, or the vilest of adulators, ready to turn her back on duty for the simmer of love? Is Mathilde submissive, or arrogant and dominant?<br /><br />The answer to all questions is yes. We are all divided. <br /><br />Be honest with yourself for a minute. Aren't people sometimes cruel, and sometimes kind; Sometimes, honest, sometimes mildly deceitful, telling white lies, and sometimes bold-faced liars? Since Stendhal is faithful to this, and does not give us character in black and white, he has produced a masterpiece. <br /><br />One last point: You do not need a lot of historical background to understand the author's critique of society. The basic overview laid out in the introduction, and my college course in Western Civ gave me the jist of the cultural goings-on. I even found French culture around the time of Stendhal remarkably similar to our own. The emphasis on external instead of the internal (Brittany Spears, try as she might, is not near as powerful as Bob Dylan, though a good deal more polished and wealthy) strikes home. In our culture, all heroism is gone, and we are left with shallow clubbers, athletes and supermodels as role models. How like Stendhal's effete social elite.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book because it does transcend time.	2002-03-22

Zukav is a great writer who has the knack for making complex ideas simple. I, like many reviewers, first read his science writing. In fact,  \\"The Dancing Wu-Li Masters\\" was my first intro to quantum theory, which shook my Newtonian worldview. Then, armed with the ideas, I met the math in college physics, and trembled! <br /><br />The \\"Seat of the Soul\\" is a lot like its predecessor. It takes complex ideas, and presents them in a way we can all understand. The crux of Zukav's spiritual message is if you want to change your life, change your mind. Tune into channel WGOD, so to speak. <br /><br />\\"Seat\\" is a simple wisdom book. It is general, and can be applied to whatever particular spiritual tradition you use, be it Zen, Christianity or Wicca. It does not go into classifications of Divas and Angels and rituals Etc., like so many New Age books do. Its value is its simple, straightforward presentation of the ideas. This directness is a hallmark of good writing. <br /><br />I think that many of the critics here are confused by the style. Since it is so direct, it comes across as didactic to some. It seems that Zukav rewrote the piece to death, since clear communication was his goal. My evidence: so many direct verbs, and barely a passive verb in sight. In fact, the text is as terse and to the point as a business communication is supposed to be. I suggest some of the critics who were put off by the author's \\"absolutism\\" reread the book with this in mind, since I find the ideas open-ended. Having examined my life through Zukav's prism, and applied his ideas to better myself, I find his philosophy quite sound. You do get what you expect. Amazing.<br /><br />I do have problems, however, with the lack of sources. Some of the ideas clearly came from the Vedic scripture, some from Taoist teachings, others from Judeo-Christian-Islamic sources, and some from Jung. It would do most readers a world of good to see that Zukav, indeed the entire New Age movement, is merely translating ancient religions' mystical understandings into an easily accessible form. I am also not 100% sold on reincarnation, but am willing to keep an open mind. <br /><br />These failings aside, this is a wonderful book, loaded with insight. It has been a pleasure to have made its acquaintance.	2002-03-22

Try as I might, I still cannot help but picture Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher whenever McMurphy or Nurse Ratched were \\"on stage.\\" <br /><br />Much more complex than the movie, the novel works on many levels. The characters are gripping, and the psychological undertones amazing. I read this first in high school, again in college, and twice during adult life, and each time I see something new in it that I hadn't seen before. In short, it is a modern masterpiece. <br /><br />The book is told from the Chief's viewpoint. Chief deeply troubled psychotic, and pulling this off is Kesey's tour-de-force. Every utterance of this schizophrenic character rings true as he moves from the \\"fog\\" of fear into the real world. Not only does this progression make the novel more interesting than the movie, it makes you question certain elements of the movie. <br /><br />For instance, was Mac a savior, or simply a dangerous whacko? The movie points towards savior, but the savior interpretation is merely the interpretation of a troubled mind yearning to be free in the novel. The nurse, too, seems less intimidating when you move back from the Chief's interpretation of her. I imagine that she was more humane than his inner fears and the fog that stands between him and the world would allow him to see. Once this is understood, the characters of Mac and Big Nurse become less \\"cut and dried,\\" and more real, more vital and much more ambiguous. And Kesey's true purpose seems to surface. The actual characters of Mac/ Big Nurse are not important; how they react on the Chief's psyche is.<br /><br />Seen in this way, the novel traces one of Joseph Campbell's grand mythic themes: The liberation of the masculine psyche from the chaotic rubble of the mother dominated chaos (can you tell this interpretation is based on my college paper?). This journey, which Campbell describes in his \\"Hero With a ThousandFaces,\\" is a man's major mission early in life. To be free, a male must liberate himself from the feminine and establish himself in the real world. Mythic literature the world over teems with this theme. A man's inability to liberate himself from this dark, restraining yet safe world is a major cause of many psychoses. Kesey has managed to bring that myth into the modern world, and the effects are just as amazing and relevant as the original myths were. <br /><br />By the way, I received an \\"A+\\" on my college paper, which took the novel apart along these lines. I hope that a student here or there stumbles on this. There is ample room for exploration in this book that seems so simple on the outside, but so deep and complex the deeper you dig. This is, after all, the mark of a truly great work of art. <br /><br />At the same time, don't let all this \\"noodling\\" ruin such a perfectly enjoyable book.

Books	4	19	21	N	N	Interesting	\\"Games People Play\\" is a thought-provoking book, still salient after all those years. It got me out of a bad relationship, and made me see myself in a new light. It goes to show that new and improved isn't necessarily better. <br />I had spent a couple of years chasing a drug-loving girl with a heart of gold. I was enchanted by the night-life some of our acquaintances were exposing me to. The darker sides of town are really quite interesting if you view them from within, but my corporate lifestyle, as well as my general avoidance of drugs, had effectively closed me out of this lifestyle after my experimental college days. Thanks to this book, I saw the game I was playing; \\"Patsy\\" to a bunch of druggies and alchies.  <br />\\"Games\\" has been helpful in my quest for a real Adult-Adult relationship. Even in business, I find myself striving for Adult-Adult relationships. Knowing the games, it makes it easier to spot them and react to them. It also helps me see where others are coming from.  <br />The book itself wasn't earth shattering for me (Peck's \\"Road Less Traveled\\" was), but it was one of the more thought-provoking pop-psychology books I have ever read. I like the fact that it doesn't simply rehash Freudian or Jungian psychology, but builds a new quite useful framework to look at relationships. My problem with the book is that it is too short. I wanted more depth. Because of this, I was wavering between four and five stars, so the four star rating is really a 4.5.	2001-05-24

Senge manages to describe these complex ideas with an \\"easy to follow\\" style. The author also addresses issues ignored by most of the popular business press, such as ethics and the development of truly meaningful visions and mission statements (instead of the banal sort that most of us are accustomed to, like \\"Lets increase sales by 10%\\"), yet manages to keep the book quite rigorous instead of slipping into \\"New Age\\" foolishness. I class this as one of the most comprehensive and useful management books available. Paradoxically, it is also one of the most gripping (probably because the ideas are still pretty \\"new-fangled,\\" even after 10+ years) and simplest to read once you get the general \\"gist\\" of what Systems Theory is all about.	2001-05-11

In \\"The Sibling Society,\\" he pulls off an amazing feat. Using simple tales such as \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" and the Hindu myth of Siva/Ganesha, Bly points out many of the failings evident in modern culture. His insights are measured, wise and seem quite accurate to me. Time and time again, I found myself paging through the book, nodding \\"Yes! That's it.\\" It seemed as if I were seeing the plight of Gen-Xers like myself clearly for the first time. <br /><br />Unlike most of my generation, I was raised in a traditional two-parent household. My mother was strong, gentle and patient, my father an old-fashioned, firm but fair disciplinarian. Needless to say, I was shocked when I went away to college. Though I drank, the debaucheries most people went through seemed silly and shallow. Even in corporate America, I find `brown-nosing' and petty backroom politics, instead of solid analysis and ethical behavior, to be the focus of most people's careers. Not that I am always perfect, but at least I try. <br /><br />I think Bly has done a wonderful job illuminating the nature of the dilemma I've been facing for years. Though some of his points are arguable, I think the synthesis is a pretty accurate Freudian/ Jungian relating of mythic elements of our psyches to the realities of modern life. His pointing out how the \\"super-ego\\" has shifted its emphasis from moral/ethical domination to a success/ popularity one seems to me quite apt. I can see it operating all around me. I was raised under the \\"old\\" system, and to this day find the \\"new\\" system quite alien. <br /><br />As an answer to the critic below, perhaps you are transferring your \\"shadow\\" onto the author. If anything, he is trying to awaken us from cultural trance we find ourselves in. His aim is not, heavy intellectualism, but communicating the essence of mythic/poetic dream images to normal menand women. That is much more useful than turning out a tome that a few solitary scholars will ever read. I think few authors manage to say so much so simply as Bly manages to.	2001-05-11

The drills Ms. Madrigal presents are easy to remember and fun to do, not like those tedious translations and verb conjugations that college texts are so fond of. In two months, studying this book in my spare time, I retained more Spanish than I did in an entire academic year. And, for the first time, I can actually say that I understand Spanish.  <br /> I would supplement this book with a comprehensive book on Spanish grammar (I have the Barron&#8217;s, but I suppose any would work) and a dictionary. I would definitely recommend &#8220;Breaking Out of Beginner&#8217;s Spanish&#8221; by Joseph Keenan for an in depth take on colloquial Spanish as well. Further, if you have the money, buy the \\"Pimsleur Comprehensive\\" series as well. Get vol.&#8217;s 1-3, even though they are pricey.

Though not entirely disappointed, I really do not feel this book lived up to its top billing.<br /><br />I found a lot of the sections unclear, mostly because the authors skimp on the necessary math, trying to describe numeric concepts with words; Sort of like \\"using a screwdriver to carve roast beef,\\" as Tom Robbins once quipped. Additionally, the Portable MBA series' format, with different authors each writing a chapter, detracts from the book's cohesiveness. A book by one author (or several edited into one continuous voice) tends to hold together better. For example, I got more out of the briefer introduction to fiscal management, \\"Finance and Accounting for the Non-Financial Manager\\" by Steven Finkler due to its one-voice cohesiveness than I did from the Portable MBA.  <br /><br />On the up side, the first chapter is a brilliant exposition on how day-to-day business activities translate into the standard accounting reports. This section also illustrates how a manager can use spreadsheets to observe how changing prices or costs affect the \\"bottom line,\\" and how financials can be used to build a strategy. I also found the chapter on budgeting quite helpful. However, when the book delves into finance, the lack of math really begins to take its toll. If it weren't for the Finkler book, I doubt I would have the faintest idea what capital budgeting was all about. All things considered, \\"The PMBA in F&amp;A\\" is a decent but flawed book. However, when it is on, it is brilliant.	2001-04-29

If some readers think that Singer is unfocused and  unscientific, I’d suggest their going to the source. Jung’s writings  meander like the subconscious streams he plummets into. His thinking is  generally inter-relational and holistic, not as mechanistic and  “simplistic” as Freud’s theories tend to be. Jung wasn’t happy with  merely restoring a patient’s ego to the status-quo; he wanted to know and  understand the whole-shebang. He had an inkling that there was more to  reality than rational systems could explain, and spent his life exploring  this realization. <br /><br />Basically, Freud was a depth psychologist using a  mechanistic model, where humans are seen as separate units being driven by  internal “engines”, whereas Jung’s model is closer to a quantum  theory of the subconscious mind, with humans, indeed all reality, connected  by a field on the deep level that is incompatible with &quot;ego&quot;  functioning. All things, he seems to say, affect all other things, just as  a lot of quantum mechanical experiments illustrate about the physical  world. He called this &quot;inter-realtedness&quot; the collective  subconscious for lack of a better term, I suppose. <br />Both views, by the  way, are essential; simply two sides of the same coin. Freud developed a  more practical, easier to use system, but Jung is the superior theorist.<br />  <br />I think Singer not only does an admirable job explaining Jung. Though it  takes some work to read, I really like the way she illustrates examples  with stories from her practice. She organizes and humanizes the often  incomprehensible theories of Jung with real-world examples. I have read the  book four times in my life, and have found it ever more reliable and  insightful as I grow older. While I still love to ponder Jung, withoutSinger and her real-world case studies, I would have been lost. <br /><br />As an  aside, I would suggest to anyone doubting the difference in the sexes to  pick up Jean Shinoda Bolen’s &quot;The Goddesses in Everywoman&quot; and  &quot;The Gods in Everyman&quot; for a modern, post-feminist perspective on  these issues. Her point, as well as Jung’s, is that men and women are  different. Equally powerful, but different.	2000-09-01

Build a castle, it says, of very tough, unbreachable stone. Make the castle impenetrable. The Ruler's room is in the very center, his apartments  a raised tower, with bars and the windows so no assasins can get in. He  can't really look out, unfortunately, due to the bars.<br />He must select two  advisors, of slightly unequal power, with great care. Both of these  advisers have troops at their commands. The lesser of the two commanders,  The Second Advisor, desperately wants to gain favor in the eye of the  Ruler, and become First Adivisor. Thus, Second plots against First, while  being loyal to the Ruler. First wants to be Ruler, but is afraid that, if  he fails, Second will become either First or Ruler, and he'll end up  dead.<br />About the Ruler's chamber are concentric rings of guards. Those  nearest the Ruler are the Second Advisor's guards; they are faithful to the  Ruler because their commander wants to gain favor with the ruler. The next  ring are controled by First, and they are trying to sneak past Second's  troops, to get to the Ruler. However, they are held in check by yet another  ring of Second's troops, who are inturn surrounded by yet another ring of  First's troops... so on and so on, ad infinitum. The mutual distrust  spreads throughout the kingdom. First against Second, with the Ruler safe  in the web of mistrust he's spun.<br />The only problem is, he's a prisoner in  his own castle. This, then, is machiavellian politics, the subject of  Koestler's &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;.<br />Objectively, the story deals  with Rubashov's imprisonment. On one hand, Rubashov is an inhuman,  reasoning monster, killing Arlova, Little Loewy and Richard by ostricizing  them from the monolithic &quot;Party&quot;. On the other hand, he's a sort  of noble figure, dying for his beleifs. Unlike a despot, trying to keep his  power, he reasons that the Revolution must go on. It is larger than him. He  must sacrifice himself, the good of the many outweighing the good of the  one. Oddly heroic, he follows the logic of his life to its pitiful end, his  death. &quot;A shrug of eternity.&quot;<br />We Americans can easily see this  as a send up of Soviet power, but Koestler's ends are, I believe, more  ambitious than that. &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; dissects all political  power. Substitute &quot;the church&quot; or &quot;liberty&quot; or  &quot;America, right or wrong&quot; for the words &quot;The Party&quot; and  &quot;The revolution&quot;, and you'll get my drift. Political power is, by  it nature, but especially in the 20th and 21st ceneturies, monolithic.  Democratic America is not immune to this. Remember McCarthy, the South  before Civil Rights, and what good, God fearing Americans did to the  Indians. Our hands are not clean. We are perpetrators, too. We are  &quot;The Party&quot;, as much as the Soviets. Koestler emphasises the  universality of his argument by keeping the country's name and #1's name  unspoken.<br />This is what makes the book, for me, so chilling.<br />The only  way out, as Rubashov sees in the end, is to balance thought with feeling,  science with art. To be complete, an individual must attain Freud's  'oceanic feeling' while his feet are firmly rooted. Castles in the air must  have foundations on the ground. Only until man is sober enough, is mature  enough can such a thing happen.<br />*As an aside, I never heard of this book  until Modern Library included it among their &quot;100 best novels of the  20th Century.&quot; Problem is, it was translated. Where is Mann, Hesse,  Camus and Solzhenitsyn? Perhaps it was because he was a British citizen at  the time, and it was originally published in English? I'd like to know.  Minor critique of a good list.	2000-04-01

It is a 'hard read' even for me, a good reader; my consistant criticism against Joyce is that he intentionally works to hide his arguments, his characters, and his thematic material behind a mind-boggling wall of style in  &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot;, though his earlier  works are quite approachable. <br />Too bad. The book is actually quite deeply  human, and funny as hell. Bloom is a decent, bungling 'hero', a human like  all of us. He's got his strengths, his weaknesses. I see him wandering flat  footed in his black slacks like Charlie Chaplin through the crazy, jangling  streets of Dublin. The night-town scene is a burlesque with a keenly  penetrating, humanistic mind firmly at the helm. The barroom brawl a riot,  especially with the dual narrators; the uneducated clod of low  intelligence, and the archaic, mythic intonations of the blabber mouthed  rhetoritician. <br />He muses on the  wonder of existance; how we, living, dead breaths breath. How man and woman  come together, making love and making babies. How, ultimately, we are all  connected, umbilically to the past through our connections with the Tribe  of Man.<br />&quot;God loves everybody,&quot; says the comic,  absurd voice in the barroom scene. It is funny. We grin, chuckle at the  absurd voice. But it is true. It is Joyce's central theme.<br />Unfortunately, what he's  mostly done is kept a ton of scholars busy writing 'commentaries' for a  book that is revelant, all too human, and funny as hell... Perhaps even  more hillarious than &quot;Catch-22&quot;... but that's debatable. <br />I  give it five stars because I happen, through the graces of a good  education, to be able to understand it. It is towering and complex. If  you're willing to work, go for it. It will take you some time; took me two  solid weeks of work. Still, when you're through, there's a sense of mental  satisfaction. You feel like you've solved a great logic puzzle. However,  don't just read it for themes; try to recreate the scenes and dialog in  your mind. This isn't easy, granted. Joyce's style makes it tough.. but do!  The rewards are immeasurable. Once you see these characters as real, solid  characters, not as abstractions, the lights begin to shine, and you  understand how Joyce sees the mythic/ religious shining through our  chaotic, jumble of the modern world.	2000-03-31
