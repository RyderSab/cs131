He is honest about himself, his character and subsequent flaws. He places a lot of emphasis on the  deep and meaningful relationship with his mother. <br />In part two the book deals with the discovery, diagnosis, battle and remission of cancer. Armstrong is once again very open and honest in sharing his emotional state with the reader. He writes in detail about the disease, the process of chemotherapy, and the many professionals, friends and family who supported him through very dark and uncertain times. <br />The third and final part of Armstrong's book is actually too good to be true. In it he describes his recovery or remission, if you will, the fact that he also gets the girl and goes on to prove the entire cycling establishment wrong by winning the 1999  Tour de France as a member of the USPS team. Of course none of the pages are sugar coated. Lance describes in detail what it feels like to be dropped by sponsors, to struggle back into racing shape, and how to cycle arguably the most grueling race in the world. <br />Anyone can clearly profit from reading the book and perhaps even receive an education in sheer courage and determination. <br />Of of the finest quote from his book is this: &quot;If you ever get a second chance in life for something, you've got to go all the way.&quot; Lance Armstrong certainly did.	2001-08-09

It tells the story of the halfling Frodo Baggins, who receives a magic Ring of Invisibility from his uncle Bilbo (see The Hobbit).  Frodo discovers that the ring has the power to control the entire world and, he discovers, to corrupt its owner. Joined by fellow hobbits, dwarfs, elves, and men he goes on a mission to destroy the Ring by casting it into the fires of the Crack of Doom where it was forged. Their mission is opposed by Sauron and his evil Black Riders.  In summary the book recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age.  It is a time men rise to dominance and the magic of old begins to fade.<br />The book is exciting, detailed, filled with diversity of scenes and characters.  Tolkien's masterpiece is exhaustive and it is difficult to imagine another fantasy novel being it's equal.  I recommend this work for anyone who appreciates skillful writing.	2001-02-05

The selected essays are interesting and often very funny, but I somehow expected a more comprehensive and well-rounded selection of his writings.  The book is certainly entertaining and sometimes insightful - hence a purchase to be considered.  However, a better job could have been done in selecting the material for the book - including perhaps a selection of his famous aphorisms.	2001-02-02

A distinguished man of letters and hermeneutic scholar he presents the encyclical of Paul to the church at Rome in a logical and systematic manner with philological references throughout.  Dr. Gorden H. Clark considered it to be the definitive work on the epistle.<br />The commentary will be more useful to the advanced student in that it presumes thorough knowledge of Greek, New Testament history and reformed apologetics.  Those interested in a less tedious work should consider John Murray's &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot; (ISBN: 0802843417).	2001-01-25

Stuart Russell's nineteenth-century classic is a feast for students of hermaneutics and linguistics.  Contending that christological eschatology has been realized via the ushering in of a New Testament economy Russell's book is quite organized and carefully argued.<br />Regardless of one's viewpoint on final things the Parousia is a quality work of christian scholarship and will be of value even if the reader cannot reach the same conclusions.  It remains an important treatment on the subject of biblical eschatology.	2001-01-25

Not until age 40 did I get around to read the wonderful story of the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, an unlikely hero who was picked by the wizard Gandalf to join a band of bearded dwarves to reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug.<br />The Hobbit is captivating without any dull points in the story line. The descriptions of the imaginary world reflect Tolkien's unrivaled creative genius.<br />If you have not read The Hobbit I highly recommend this enjoyable work of fiction.	2001-01-24

Having hiked across the US and having spent a year in Alaska I know how unforgiving the land can be.  The story left me speechless, since I understood McCandless' intend all too well.

Chang created a fluid and readable translation of this classic work, which is useful to any student of religion and folk tales.  Central to the translation is the message of transforming human frailty into buddhahood.   As a poet and musician, Milarepa chose to guide through song. Milarepa was both radical and loving to all whom he encountered. Mila, too, amply revealed his human frailty during the process of enlightenment. He not only overcame a series of personal tragedies, but also evolved into the consummate example of mastering the poisons of anger and revenge - transforming enemies into friends and bringing many to the dharma.<br />Milarepa is highlighted as an example of how anyone can achieve enlightenment through hard work and perserverance despite his or her past. He shows us that we can all transform our hearts.	2000-10-20

Walter Kaufmann's translation offers helpful footnotes and comments for the reader.  The translation is fluid and easy to read.  Kaufmann captures Nietsche's often humorous critiques as well as his fabulous aphorisms (&quot;Where man cannot find anything to see or to grasp, he has no further business&quot;).  Regardless of one's point of view  &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; is a must read for anyone who takes a serious interest in the development of philosophy, especially existentialism and nihilism.  Compared to the works of Immanuel Kant the writings of Nietsche are a sheer delight - but that is another review...	2000-10-20

The book offers  practical advise from years of personal experience for anyone thinking about a trip to the area.  Bezruchka also creates a much needed ecological awareness and offers substantial insight into the culture of Nepal.  The book is much more than a travel guide and just plain interesting.

The book is not meant to be exhaustive, nor does it include any commentary by the great scholar - rather it is a resource of texts to enable research, study or simply the casual reading of these non-Western traditions.

OK, not being a scholar of Chinese textual criticism I cannot compare fragments of actual copies to check translation - but then I am not a religious purist - nor do I want to be.  Mitchell's work resonates with me and his style is fluid - above all I can actually make sense out of the text.  It speaks to me.  I checked some of the &quot;serious&quot; translations and found them to be difficult and cold.  Mitchell's translation is fun and some of his added commentary insightful.  I love it and recommend it to any lover of poetry and literature.	2000-10-11

If Kim Hewitt did not wish to convey this message she needs to take additional courses in communication and linguistics rather then pursuing a Ph.D. - God help us all!

The 2 Vol set gives insight into Calvin's mind, which was moved by a passion for his belief system and a sometimes misguided anger to those who had a different view point.  The reformed movement suffered from a lack of compassion, which often erupted in physical violence and murder.  Calvin's fervor was undeniable and so was his rather cold sense of logic.  Both are well captured in this traditional translation of the classic work.  Recommended reading.	2000-10-06
