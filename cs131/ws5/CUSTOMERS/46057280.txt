Queens, in New York City, is the most ethnically diverse community in the country. Over a period of three years, from 1999 to 2002, editors Warren Lehrer and Judith Sloan collected stories from a sampling of the borough's 2 million residents. The result is this book, a much needed tribute to the people, most of them immigrants, who make Queens such a culturally rich locale.<br /><br />The stories are wide and varied: a Congolese man who fled his country to seek asylum in the United States, only to be detained for nearly two years once he arrived here; an Afghan woman and her mother who were separated from each other for 22 years; a gay Colombian couple forced to flee their home; a pair of Egyptian brothers who opened a cafe and restaurant in Astoria. It's impossible to summarize them all here.<br /><br />The words of the storytellers are, for the most part, kept intact. Everything is quoted directly, and even the speech mannerisms of those with rough or accented English are preserved, making the book feel just as colorful and diverse as the people featured in it. In a few cases, where the interviewee spoke little or no English at all, the stories are translated from the teller's native language. The editors have included helpful explanatory notes where the storyteller's make reference to events and individuals with which the reader may not be readily familiar.<br /><br />\\"Crossing the BLVD\\" is also a refreshing visual treat. There are numerous photographs, pieces of artwork, maps, and other visuals. Each page has clearly been laid out with loving attention. Font style, size, and placement, along with the placement of the pictures, is carefully balanced to achieve certain effects. The book is just as colorful and full of character as the people whose stories it relates.<br /><br />This is definitely a book everyone should read. Though nearly 400 pages in length, the text is large and makes for quick reading. But this simplicity is only a cover for the rich, inspiring, and heartfelt stories these people have to share. \\"Crossing the BLVD\\" certainly has something to offer any reader.nspiring, and heartfelt stories these people have to share. \\"Crossing the BLVD\\" certainly has something to offer any reader.	2005-05-09

This is an important book for anyone seeking insight into the cultural divisions present in our society. Maurice Berger writes from an interesting perspective, to say the least. As a Jewish, homosexual son of a racist mother and a schizophrenic father who nearly idolized black people and took Martin Luther King, Jr., as a personal hero, Berger has witnessed the many and varied effects of racial bigotry firsthand. Here he has collected his observations together in a series of short vignettes, interspersed with stories from interviewees, excerpts from books, etc. As a whole, the book offers an enlightening look at the dynamics of race and racism in the United States.<br /><br />As a child, Berger was never quite sure where he fit in the social spectrum. Physically, he was white, yet he was picked on for being Jewish. He felt more kinship with the black students at the schools he attended than with his fellow whites, yet he was not always welcome among the black children either. He talks of not knowing on which side of the racially divided cafeteria he should sit.<br /><br />The atmosphere at home offered no respite, either. Berger's mother is one of the most interesting, for lack of a better word, people discussed in the book. Unable to deal with the discrimination directed at her for her Jewishness, she created an outlet for herself by directing her pent-up anger at the black community. She at once protested bigotry in the form of anti-Semitism, and perpetuated the cycle of discrimination through her own racism. To make matters more confusing for Berger, his father loved black people, viewing them as brothers in his own suffering.<br /><br />Berger opens by recounting his parents reactions to the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. He talks of hearing his mother spew venom at the television, shouting that King had deserved to die, and then passing into the next room to find his father sobbing, overcome with grief. What is a child to do in such a divided household? Berger himself rode both sides of the wave of racism. As a child he reached out to black students, seeing them, much as his father did, as fellow sufferers with whom he could empathize. Later, however, he found himself beginning to resent people of color when he perceived, falsely, that affirmative action was cheating him out of certain entitlements. It was not until years later that he began to chip away at his own racial prejudices, enabling him, finally, to write this book.<br /><br />Berger has also included stories and comments from the lives of others. He includes both whites and people of color. Some offer scholarly analyses of racism, and others simply relate encounters, in their own lives, with bigotry and its consequences. Berger has chosen well what to include, and provides a full spectrum of viewpoints and opinions.<br /><br />Though progress has been made since the advent of the civil rights movement, racism is not, as some believe, gone. Far from it. The following observation is particularly telling: \\"Middle-class African Americans now endure a racism that is generally far less virulent than in earlier times but no less real: white merchants who drop change on the counter rather than touch their hands; cabdrivers who bypass them to pick up white passengers across the street; white salespeople who, assuming they have no money, patronize them in jewelry stores and automobile showrooms; and security guards who follow them around department stores\\" (165).<br /><br />If I were to criticize one thing about this book it would be the lack of a real sense of conclusion. The pieces are all related, yes, but I feel as if Berger could have made more effort to give us a comprehensive parting message - something with a little more punch, that would drive people to action. Nevertheless, the insights offered here are important, and I urge everyone to read this book. Racial discrimination is still very present in our world, and for that reason it is important that we do all we can to generate awareness of the problem and action to dismantle the infrastructure of racism.oblem and action to dismantle the infrastructure of racism.	2005-04-19

Even the fact that I was able to go for so long without recognizing the significance of race in my life is a manifestation of my white privilege. Children of color, however, are generally confronted by the fact of their race at a much earlier age. Their process of identity development differs significantly from that of most white children. This is the issue psychologist Beverly Tatum discusses in her book. She opens with the question that forms the book's title: \\"Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?\\" It is common to see high school students self-segregate, socializing in groups composed mostly of others of the same racial background. But why is this?<br /><br />Because Tatum herself is a black woman, she predominantly addresses the identity development of black individuals. She cites psychologist William Cross in describing the stages of development: pre-encounter, when young children simply absorb the messages they receive from those around them, not yet having reason to question them; encounter, when an individual first becomes aware of racism through some \\"event or series of events that force the young person to acknowledge [its] personal impact\\" (55); immersion/emersion, when the individual works actively to learn about and affirm their own racial identity; and internalization/commitment, when the individual has established a positive personal identity for him/herself. Throughout, Tatum offers explanations for the behaviors many black adolescents may engage in which may puzzle their white counterparts, including the reason for student self-segregation along racial lines. Tatum also provides tips for black parents looking for ways to help their children successfully deal with the racism they encounter and develop a positive sense of self.<br /><br />Tatum then goes on to discuss the identity development of white people. Because white individuals are a part of the dominant culture in the United States, they are often oblivious to the fact that they, too, are a part of a racial group. \\"But I'm just normal!\\" they may say (93). However, this mode of thinking can and does cause significant problems for whites and people of color alike. Tatum analyzes these problems and their roots, and explains how white parents can raise their children to have a positive awareness of race. She debunks the popular idea that it is best to be \\"color-blind,\\" revealing the damage this ideology does and why racial awareness, when free of negative prejudices and stereotypes, is actually a good thing. Tatum also discusses, more briefly, the identity development of Latino/Hispanic, Native American, Asian American, and biracial individuals, and the issues unique to each ethnic grouping.<br /><br />White readers may have some trouble with this book for a variety of reasons. Some may be offended, as several other reviews here clearly demonstrate. The book raises issues most white people have never had to think about before. When confronted with these ideas for the first time, it can feel like a personal attack. But Tatum is not engaging in white-bashing or \\"reverse racism\\" as some might claim. Nowhere does she accuse all white people of being actively racist. In fact, she points out that the majority are not. Her primary concern here is the ingrained cultural behaviors people often engage in without even realizing that they may be, and most likely are, hurting someone of another race. It is these more subtle, more insidious manifestations of racism that Tatum seeks to bring to our attention, so that we can all work to weed these often-unconscious behaviors from our lives.<br /><br />Another common reaction among white readers is to be overwhelmed with a sense of guilt at the realization that one's past actions, done unconsciously and without any racist intent, were actually hurtful and offensive to people of color around them. The biggest piece of advice I can offer readers who find themselves experiencing such a reaction is this: Do not beat yourself up for things you may have done in the past without knowing better; Tatum acknowledges that she herself has made mistakes, and a sincere apology is usually sufficient to gain forgiveness, if it has not already been granted without your asking. And even if it is not, you cannot change the past and you will accomplish nothing by dwelling on it. Rather, use your newfound awareness to move forward in a more positive way.<br /><br />\\"Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?\\" is a profoundly important book. One other reviewer stated, and I agree, that this should be required reading for all American high school students. And I will go further to say that many of the issues Tatum writes about here should be discussed with children at even younger ages. It is never too early to begin educating one's child about the realities of race and racism, and help them form a healthy personal identity. While this book's primary importance may be in bringing awareness to white readers, it should in no way be restricted to a white readership. People of color - be they Black, Latino, Native American, or Asian American - will find plenty of worthwhile material here as well. Throughout her discussions on race, Tatum offers readers of color tools they can use to develop and maintain a positive sense of self in the midst of a racist environment.

This book really wasn't at all what I was expecting, or what the title would lead one to believe. The subtitle, \\"In Search of Grace O'Malley and Other Legendary Women of the Sea,\\" makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of Grace O'Malley, with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers. Not so. The first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself, and Sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information. I knew almost nothing about Grace O'Malley going into the book, and I know little more than that now. The other women included are discussed in even sparer detail, and most of them aren't even real historical figures, but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids. She even talks about Pippi Longstocking! Not what I was expecting at all...<br /><br />\\"The Pirate Queen\\" is actually devoted far more to Sjoholm's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself. I learned more about Sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study. She describes the inns she stayed at, the weather, the tourists she met, her own childhood, the abundance of \\"personal bath mats\\" in northern European hotels... almost everything but Grace O'Malley and her cohorts. In fact, the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from Wilson to Sjoholm; a story which, to be quite honest, I really couldn't care less about. I bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures. It turned out to be a travel memoir, and a comparatively uninteresting one at that.<br /><br />This is a shame, really. Sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - Grace O'Malley herself, Bessie Millie, Janet Forsyth, Christian Robertson, Eliza Fraser, Isobel Gunn, Betty Mouat, Freydis Eiriksdottir, Skipper Thuridur, Trouser-Beret, Alfhild, the \\"herring lassies,\\" and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite, but then fails to deliver a full, satisfying portrait of any of them. She raises more questions than she answers, and I'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information. You may also notice, given the names, that nearly all the women mentioned are northern European in origin. Sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world, such as the famous pirates Anne Bonney and Mary Read who, though from Europe, sailed the Caribbean.<br /><br />As for Sjoholm's writing style, the book is an easy read, but not a very enjoyable one. Sjoholm's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors. For example: \\"The lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates, walnuts, and chocolate chips. In the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola\\" (pg. 222). Flowery, gratuitous, and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin, you might say... It's not the worst book I've ever read, but I do wish I'd spent my money on something else. It doesn't deliver what it promises, and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead.lassies,\\" and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite, but then fails to deliver a full, satisfying portrait of any of them.

This debut novel from Indu Sundaresan, based on historical events, recounts the first three and a half decades in the life of Mehrunnisa, a young woman who would later be known as Empress Nur Jahan. Even as a young girl she was determined to one day marry the handsome Prince Salim. And when the prince happens to meet Mehrunnisa a few times, quite by accident, he is enchanted with her as well. But Mehrunnisa is married off to another man, a mere soldier, who treats her with cruelty and does not love her. The book follows her through her twenty-seven years of marriage to Ali Quli.<br /><br />This period of time, encompassing the late 16th and early 17th centuries, saw many historically significant events: Prince Salim's rebellion against his father, Emperor Akbar; the rebellion of Salim's own son after Salim takes the throne as Emperor Jahangir; Ali Quli's fateful alliance with the rebel Prince Khusrau; along with other wars of the time. We see Mehrunnisa endure the many hardships that come her way as her family is shamed and disreputed by the actions of her husband and brother, and how they eventually manage to regain the emperor's esteem. And ultimately, we see the fruition of the childhood passion between Salim and Mehrunnisa when she becomes Emperor Jahangir's twentieth and most influencial wife.<br /><br />\\"The Twentieth Wife\\" is rich in historical detail, which I found interesting as I have little knowledge of the Mughal Empire. The downside, however, is that the characters are poorly developed. They are ultimately forgettable. Large-scale events overshadow interpersonal relations, and Mehrunnisa, her family, Jahangir, and the others remain flat and difficult to care for. The romance between Mehrunnisa and Jahangir is unconvincing. They meet only a handful of times, briefly, and exchange very few words. Sundaresan does not offer any explanation for the emperor's captivation with this woman, who was from a family that would have supplied no political advantages to the emperor via his marriage to her.<br /><br />In summation, the book provided nothing to me that a textbook wouldn't have. It added to my historical knowledge and was a relatively easy read, but did little to stir my emotions. If I ever pick up its sequel, \\"The Feast of Roses,\\" it will be out of historical interest, and not from expectation of a great story. And in all likelihood, if I find myself wanting to learn more of the history of the Mughal Empire, I'll pick up a work of non-fiction instead. This isn't a terrible novel, but there are many better pieces of historical fiction to be had, and I'd suggest passing this one by and looking elsewhere.a his marriage to her.

At first I wasn't quite sure what was going on, or what the point was, but when I got to about page 75, it suddenly all started coming together. So a word of advice to anyone having trouble \\"getting into\\" this one: Just keep going! It does make sense eventually. I can't reveal too much without spoiling the story, but after the relatively long \\"set up\\" period, the story really does start to move. Once I understood what was happening, I couldn't put the book down, and finished it in a single day. By the time I'd reached the end, I was very impressed with Berger's work.<br /><br />\\"To the Wedding\\" is narrated by a blind Greek street-peddler. He sells tamata, small metal charms supposed to bring relief to those who suffer. One day, a man stops at the stall to buy a tama for his daughter. \\"Where is she suffering?\\" the peddler asks. \\"Everywhere,\\" the father replies. He buys a tama and goes on his way. The street peddler never meets him, or his daughter, again. But he tells us a story about the girl, Ninon, and the preparations for her marriage to a man called Gino.<br /><br />This is a love story, but it is also much more. The more I reflect upon it, the more I get out of it, and I'm sure I would gain an even deeper appreciation upon reading it a second time. It explores what it means to love someone, the relationship of sex and love, and different ways to approach life in the face of knowledge of one's own mortality. If you know you are going to die in only a few years, what do you do? How do you live your life in the time between now and then? And is love in the present dependent on the possibility of having a future, or is it unconditional, in the moment? \\"To the Wedding\\" raises so many interesting questions, and offers multiple ways to view each one.<br /><br />The format of the book may be a little off-putting at first. The primary narrator is the blind street peddler, but as he peers into the lives of others, the voice shifts from his own first-person viewpoint to the perspectives of his characters, told in first-person in Ninon's case, and third-person for the others - Ninon's father, mother, and Gino. We also jump from one person's life to another very rapidly, and sometimes it is hard to tell who is speaking, and whose eyes we are seeing through. Sometimes Berger will include something that seems to be of little importance, but do not overlook them - they invariably become important later on. I actually think that this fragmented story-telling style ultimately enhances the content of the book, but it takes a little getting used to.<br /><br />I strongly urge everyone to read this book. \\"To the Wedding\\" has something to offer any reader that is willing to take a little time to reflect upon the themes it presents.

The book opens in the fall of 1939. An unnamed, black-haired, dark-eyed 6-year-old boy is separated from his parents at the beginning of World War II. Wandering the countryside alone, the boy is mistaken for a Gypsy or a Jew by the fair-haired, blue-eyed rural villagers, and accordingly shunned. Even those who do shelter and feed him usually treat him with cruelty. But, even more disturbing, the boy's eyes are opened to the superstition-driven brutality with which these country folk treat their own neighbors, and even their own family members.<br /><br />This is not an uplifting read. The cruelty the boy witnesses and experiences often defies the imagination. Kosinski makes no attempt to censor his gruesome descriptions, nor should he. To gloss over the atrocities of World War II would be an injustice to those who suffered through it. Though the book is not, as some would argue, autobiographical, events like those depicted here did indeed happen during the war. It is probably safe to assume that the story takes place in Poland, though Kosinski has deliberately left out place names in order to keep the narrative separate from his own life. As he says in the author's note at the beginning, he intended the book to stand alone.<br /><br />The story actually spans the entire war, taking the boy from age six to age twelve. Over the course of the book, we witness his gradual loss of innocence. He tries repeatedly to make sense of a senseless world. For a while he throws himself fully into church, hoping that endless prayers will deliver him. When this fails, he decides that the only way to escape suffering is to make a pact with the devil. And when this, too, fails to relive his misery, he becomes entirely disillusioned with humanity. We see him begin, bit by bit, to embrace the very violence that has caused him so much pain. It is the only way to survive in the war-torn world around him.<br /><br />\\"The Painted Bird\\" is tragically disillusioning, yet weaves a brilliant picture of the boy's psychological transformation. It will leave you feeling empty, but raises crucial issues to the reader's attention. Kosinski has deliberately used a very young, innocent child as the protagonist in order to emphasize the destructive, corrupting nature of war. At a time when war is a distant thing, taking place on other continents, it is easy to glorify it and to forget what a hell it is for those experiencing it first-hand. For this reason, books like \\"The Painted Bird\\" are especially necessary, forcing us to look at the physical and emotional havoc war can wreak on a person. Though I would highly recommend the book to anyone, it is not for the weak of stomach. Be prepared for a dark and disturbing journey.ce that has caused him so much pain.

Virginia Woolf's \\"Orlando\\" is unique in form, being a mock biography of a fictional character. We are introduced to Orlando, a protagonist based partly on Woolf's close friend Vita Sackville-West, as a 16-year-old boy, the son of noble parents, in the latter years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. By the end of the book, more than three hundred years later, he has become a 36-year-old woman living in \\"modern\\" times (meaning 1928, the year of publication).<br /><br />Woolf uses Orlando's sexual transformation and long life as a vehicle for investigating influences on and consequences of gender and sexuality through history. Her commentary is pointed and often right on the mark. But at the same time, the book is infused with Woolf's dry wit, giving everything a humorous overtone. For example, when Orlando returns to England after his transformation, everyone at home assuming him to be dead, she finds herself embroiled in a legal battle to get her property back: \\"The chief charges against her were (1) that she was dead, and therefore could not hold any property whatsoever; (2) that she was a woman, which amounts to much the same thing\\" (168). One can tell that, while these issues were obviously important to her, Woolf was having fun when she wrote this.<br /><br />Now, as far as my personal reaction, I am going to be among the minority of reviewers here in saying that overall I really didn't much care for the book. In talking to others who have read it, I've noticed that \\"Orlando\\" seems to be one of those \\"love it or hate it\\" works. Perhaps I went into it with the wrong expectaions, this being my first Woolf novel, but it just kind of fell flat for me. I certainly wasn't expecting it to be the kind of book it was. Thinking it was going to be a historical fiction piece with a serious tone, I found it to be much more like a more emotional version of \\"Candide.\\" Much of it is farcical, and certainly far from being believable.<br /><br />Though Woolf makes some very insightful and worthwhile social commentary here, her presentation, I felt, detracted from its impact. The fantasy-world feel that permeates much of it makes it seem unreal, and therefore less applicable to our own world. In addition, the narrative tone changes from time period to time period, which makes the book feel disjointed. Just as you get used to one style - BAM! - it changes to a different tone and you're left feeling disoriented all over again. And furthermore, Orlando her/himself doesn't feel like a real person. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't empathize with her/him. All of this, I found, got in the way of the actual story and its intended impact.<br /><br />In summary, I do commend Woolf's experimentation in style, and as I noted the underlying messages are important, but overall the book just wasn't as strong as it could have been. If you're a fan of Woolf, go ahead and give it a try. You may well find that you like it after all. But if you like more reality-rooted and tonally serious stories, this probably won't leave you very satisfied. Try it, but calibrate your expectations first.al commentary here, her presentation, I felt, detracted from its impact.

Just as you get used to one style - BAM! - it changes to a different tone and you're left feeling disoriented all over again. And furthermore, Orlando her/himself doesn't feel like a real person. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't empathize with her/him. All of this, I found, got in the way of the actual story and its intended impact.    In summary, I do commend Woolf's experimentation in style, and as I noted the underlying messages are important, but overall the book just wasn't as strong as it could have been. If you're a fan of Woolf, go ahead and give it a try. You may well find that you like it after all. But if you like more reality-rooted and tonally serious stories, this probably won't leave you very satisfied. Try it, but calibrate your expectations first.	2005-02-21

What Jostein Gaarder has done here is to write a history of philosophy in clear, simple language, and framed the whole thing in one cohesive narrative. Sophie Amundsen, the title character, is a 14-year-old girl in Norway. One day, arriving at home after school, she finds a mysterious letter in her mailbox. The slip of paper inside says only \\"Who are you?\\" A short while later she receives another, this one asking \\"Where does the world come from?\\" After this she regularly finds such letters, addressed to herself, containing short, written lectures on philosophy. At the same time, however, she begins to receive mail addressed to \\"Hilde Moller Knag, c/o Sophie Amundsen.\\" But Sophie has never heard of Hilde before. So why is she receiving birthday cards from Hilde's father? The two sets of mysterious letters are linked in some way, but how?<br /><br />The plot, actually, is a secondary aspect of the book. \\"Sophie's World\\" is really an introductory philosophy course, suitable even for students of junior high school age (it is also, however, well worth the time to read for anyone interested in beginning to learn about philosophy, including adults of all ages). But it is really only an introduction - anyone who already has at least a basic knowledge of philosophy will not find anything new here. The book provides an overview of most of the major Western philosophers in easy-to-comprehend language, with plenty of examples. However, \\"Western\\" is the key term here. Eastern and other philosophies are occasionally briefly alluded to, but never discussed in any detail at all. Topics covered include the Natural Philosophers, Democritus, the Sophists, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Cynics, the Stoics, the Epicureans, Neoplatonism, Mysticism, Jesus of Nazareth, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Renaissance Humanism, Copernicus and Galileo, Luther, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Hume, Berkeley, the Deists, Kant, the Romanticists, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Marx, Darwin, Freud, and Existentialism. Other philosophers and movements are mentioned in passing, but not discussed at length.<br /><br />What makes \\"Sophie's World\\" so accessible, however, is the plot framing it. Without a plot to keep things moving, a subject like this could easily become dry. But Gaarder's book is anything but dry. Not only does Sophie continue to get mysterious cards and letters from Hilde's father, but she also begins to find items belonging to this unknown girl. Some of them even show up right in Sophie's bedroom! The tension increases as these incidents become more frequent, and progressively stranger. It becomes apparent that Sophie and her philosophy teacher must work together to unravel the mystery in a very short time, or face disastrous consequences. About halfway through the book, there is a radical twist that will initially set your head spinning, and then make you start to question your own reality!<br /><br />I was not entirely pleased with the way the book is wrapped up. It almost seemed to get a little too fanciful, less plausible and less based in solid philosophy. The last few chapters seemed somewhat anticlimactic, almost as if Gaarder himself wasn't sure how best to bring the book to a close. However, he really does make you look at the world and think about the concept of existence in what, for most of us, is a totally revolutionary way. And, of course, it is a great way for those new to philosophy to get their feet wet without being too overwhelmed. The book is long - more than 500 pages - but it is easy reading. The language is not difficult, and the philosophical concepts have been greatly simplified (you will want to move on to other sources for a fuller understanding of these concepts if you find you are still interested in philosophy upon completing this book). And if you need time to digest any of the information, the book is conveniently layed out so as to provide plenty of good stopping places. On the whole, a solid and worthwhile book for beginning philosophers.le, a solid and worthwhile book for beginning philosophers.	2005-02-20
US	46057280	R2IGWN3VSPIM0X	0679733485	227801639	The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony	Books	4	19	22	N	N	An enlightening interpretation of Greek mythology.	\\"The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony\\" is a truly ambitious work. Roberto Calasso has gathered together the various tales in Greek mythology, including the works of Hesiod and Homer, and put them together into one cohesive whole. Rather than simply retelling these well-known stories, the book shows the interconnectedness of events and characters, tying everything together. Calasso writes with a style that is both narrative and scholarly. He takes time to dig deeply into the underlying themes of Greek mythology, producing some profound and thought-provoking insights, but at the same time keeps the tone animated, retaining the feel that this is an epic story rather than a dry scholarly analysis.<br /><br />Despite the choice of title, the characters of Cadmus and Harmony are only mentioned a few times in passing in the main body of the work. It is not until the final chapter that they take center stage. Calasso opens the book with Zeus's abduction of Europa, and ties this in with a general theme of abduction to be found throughout Greek mythology. Then he slowly works his way back in time, taking us, in the middle of the book, to the very beginning, the creation story of the Greeks. From there Calasso moves forward once again, relating the fall of Athens, the decline of ancient Greece, and the slow fading of the gods from earthly life.<br /><br />\\"The mythographer,\\" Calasso says, \\"lives in a permanent state of chronological vertigo\\" (281). While he does make the stories flow together, it would be impossible to put them in a definite order. Trying to do so would drive one mad, and it is advisable to just sit back and enjoy the stories without worrying too much about their placement in time. In addition, since the Greek tales were primarily passed on orally, many variations on them evolved over time, and not all of these variants fit together. Nevertheless, Calasso often gives us multiple versions of a story. Don't let this confuse you too much. The Greeks themselves, Calasso tells us, \\"became so used to hearing the same stories told with different plots that it got to be a perfectly normal thing for them\\" (279). I do, however, wish Calasso had included some family trees to help keep family relations straight. I ended up jotting down my own rough lineage tables to keep the lines of descent organized in my mind.<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed to find that Calasso has not included the entirety of Greek mythology here. Ironically, the front cover shows Pandora descending to Earth with Mercury, but the story of Pandora is not mentioned in the book at all. The stories of Arachne, Prometheus, the Minotaur, and others are alluded to in passing, but never fully told. The slaying of Medusa by Perseus is not mentioned. Rather, Calasso has devoted a bit too much of the book to retelling the stories of the Iliad and the Odyssey, which one can just as easily read in those books themselves. Nevertheless, what he has done here is impressive, and well worth reading.<br /><br />The book is not what I would call an easy read, as it requires concentration on the part of the reader as Calasso analyzes the stories and their themes, but for an attentive reader it should not be overwhelmingly difficult. Calasso's style can take a little getting used to. I do not know whether to blame the author or the translator, but the book is riddled with sentence fragments which sometimes make for choppiness in the train of thought. However, there are not so many of these as to be overly distracting, and once used to the style, they are easier to digest.<br /><br />One final word of warning: The is a book for adults. If it were a movie, it would be rated X, and is best suited for readers of high school age and up. Greek sexual values would be seen as licentious by many readers of today, and Calasso makes no effort to censor them. There are extensive, detailed passages on the practice of sodomizing young boys, and on the abduction and rape of women. There is also an abundance of incest, as the Greek gods and goddesses were mind-bogglingly inbred. For example, after deposing his father, Kronos, Zeus sleeps with his mother, Demeter (a.k.a. Rhea), resulting in the birth of Persephone. Zeus then sleeps with Persephone to produce Zagreus, the first incarnation of Dionysus. The book contains debauchery in every possible form, graphically described, so this is not the version of Greek mythology to start your little ones with.<br /><br />That said, however, I would highly recommend the book to mature audiences. \\"The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony\\" an insightful and highly enjoyable read. Greek mythology has never ceased to captivate readers of subsequent ages, and Calasso offers us a clear new perspective on these ancient tales. This is a book to read slowly and to savor. It is a book you will probably want to read more than once, as it offers plenty to think about, and it certainly deserves a place on the bookshelf of anyone interested in Greek mythology and culture.here is also an abundance of incest, as the Greek gods and goddesses were mind-bogglingly inbred.

Elizabeth I was one of the most impressive monarchs in European history. Born in 1533 of Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn, she was declared illegitimate upon Anne's execution. Elizabeth's childhood was turbulent, and it was much a matter of luck that she ever came to power at all, preceded in the line of succession by her half-siblings Edward and Mary, and her legitimacy being a matter of heated debate. Elizabeth finally ascended the throne in 1558, at age twenty-five, upon Mary's death. From the very start she faced adversity. After Queen Mary (nicknamed \\"Bloody Mary\\" by an unadoring public), most Englishmen were unenthusiastic about having another female ruler. To succeed, Elizabeth would need to present herself to her people as an almost superhuman figure, a symbol of both strength and purity.<br /><br />Those considering this book should first be aware of what it's primary purpose is. It deals mainly with Elizabeth's private and social life. Politics does of course come into the book, as it can't be entirely separated from the life of a monarch, but this is not its main focus. Weir writes in her preface: \\"This was never meant to be a political biography, nor did I intend to write a social history of the times. My aim has always been to write a history of Elizabeth's personal life within the framework of her reign . . . The manuscript was originally entitled \\"The Private Life of Elizabeth I,\\" but it very soon became apparent that Elizabeth's 'private' life was very public indeed, hence the change of title.\\" The bulk of the book concerns itself with Elizabeth's relationships with other people, both personal and diplomatic. And much of this took the form of courtships. Elizabeth recognized her ability to use herself as a pawn, turning her biggest challenge - her gender - into an asset, and manipulating fellow rulers through the marriage market. She took full advantage of this, often to the exasperation of all around her.<br /><br />And of course, no account of Elizabeth's personal life would be complete without much attention paid to her particular relationship with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Weir does an admirable job in exploring the complexities of this friendship and star-crossed romance, offering one of the most compelling accounts of it that I've read anywhere. Many people have embellished the story of Elizabeth and Dudley, letting their imaginations run wild around all the details that we cannot know for sure, but Weir remains objective and honest, acknowledging the facts and offering her well-reasoned opinions, either in affirmation or refutation, of the common rumors.<br /><br />Long a fan of Queen Elizabeth I, and of the Elizabethan period of British history as a whole, I dove into this book with eagerness and, since I had previously read and been impressed with Weir's \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII,\\" high expectations as well. I was not disappointed at all. One of the striking characteristics of Weir's books is their readability. Unlike much of the dry material put out by Academia, her writing is full of life and highly accessible to a general audience. \\"The Life of Elizabeth I\\" reads more like a story than a biography, remaining rich in detail but arranging the information in such a way that it stimulates rather than strangles the reader. Elizabeth really comes alive through Weir's words, and one gets to know her most intimately as Weir reveals all the nuances of her character, strengths and weaknesses alike. The book also offers a wealth of information on lifestyles and customs of the time, painting a colorful background for Elizabeth's life.<br /><br />Included at the back are an extensive bibliography, clearly showing how exhaustively Weir researched for this book; genealogical tables on the Tudors, the Boleyns and Howards, and the Dudleys; a thorough index, making it easy to refer back information on any person, place, or event connected with Elizabeth's life; and a \\"Reader's Guide\\" that includes discussion questions for reading groups. This is one of the most engaging and informative biographies I've ever read, and I recommend it most highly to anyone interested in Tudor history. Well worth the read.oups.

One day she is visited at her remote mountainside dwelling by a wandering Jew, who was turned away at the temple because the oracle could not give him the answers he seeks concerning his destiny. He relates his story to the woman, how he was cursed by the son of God when, not knowing his identity, the man refused to let him rest for a moment against the wall of his house. The unfortunate man is now doomed to wander the earth forever, immortal, without possibility of rest or happiness. His wife and child have left him, and he is unable to find joy or fulfilment in anything. His eyes are described as empty, dried-up wells.<br /><br />The woman then tells her own story, about how she was chosen to be god's bride in the temple. Her relationship with her god is a disturbing one, passionate and violent, as she serves as a vessel through which Apollo speaks to the priests. She loves her god with a consuming fervor, but constantly feels more like an abandoned lover than a beloved bride. And when she explores the realms of human love with a man of the village, she must face the consequences of her betrayal of god. Driven from the temple by an angry mob, she seeks refuge in the mountains above the city, where she bears god's son, a witless boy who does nothing but sit all day in their hut, smiling vacantly at nothing.<br /><br />As the man and woman share their stories, they contemplate the nature of god, and the nature of the relationship between the human and the divine. We see clearly that god is not always a benevolent force, but brings both joy and sorrow, both pleasure and pain into the world. We also see that, though every person experiences god in his or her own way, no one escapes experience of the divine, and we are all bound to god, for better or for worse.<br /><br />I do not capitalize \\"god\\" here because the book is not concerned solely with the Christian God, though he does play a role in the story, but with a much broader, more universal human experience of the divine. The bulk of the book centers on the pythia's relationship with the sun god, Apollo, but we also encounter numerous other deities and spiritual forces, including more intangible river gods, tree gods, etc. Many of the deities are interconnected and cannot be fully distinguished from one another. Apollo himself is infused with references to Pan, the goat-god of the mountains above Delphi. \\"The Sibyl\\" is a captivating and deeply thought-provoking spiritual journey. It does not offer concrete answers, but inspires readers to search within themselves to discover the nature of their own, personal relationship with the divine.<br /><br />This review refers to the 1958 Vintage Books printing, translated my Naomi Walford.Christian God, though he does play a role in the story, but with a much broader, more universal human experience of the divine.

Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, the author of such books as \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" among others, was a highly intelligent and incredibly witty man. His keen observations of the world, and the often satirical commentary he made on it, are a delight to read, and this book pulls together some real gems from many of his books, speeches, and personal notebooks. There are some 358 quotations included, divided into categories as follows: (1) on men, women, children, and human nature, (2) on love, marriage, and romance, (3) on virtue, vice, and conduct, (4) on politics and history, (5) on religion, (6) on youth and aging, (7) on truth, honesty, lies, and illusion, (8) on reading, writing, and education, (9) on health and exercise, (10) on money and business, (11) on travel, and (12) on various other subjects. Each quote is attributed to its source for easy reference. This is a very slim and very affordable little volume, only fifty-five pages in length, and in fact my only criticism is that it doesn't include more material.

The first book in Sigrid Undset's trilogy recounting the life of Kristin Lavransdatter, \\"The Wreath\\" is an insightful coming-of-age story set in Norway during the Middle Ages. We follow the spirited and headstrong Kristin through her childhood and young adulthood, up to her marriage to Erlend Nikulausson of Husaby. Along the way, Kristin must traverse the confusing realms of love and religion, learn to accept responsibility for her decisions, and face the consequences of her actions. Undset clearly has a marvelous grasp of human psychology, and the exploration of Kristin's emotional and intellectual development is fascinating.<br /><br />Though Kristin is the protagonist in the story, the narrator does not focus solely on her, but also gives us glimpses into the lives of those around her, including her parents, her beloved Erlend, a kindly monk named Brother Edvin who counsels Kristin in spiritual matters and how she must maintain honor for herself and her family, and Fru Aashild, a wise woman and Erlend's aunt, who gives Kristin advice on both spiritual and day-to-day life, and how she can find peace for herself. The relationship between Kristin's parents is particularly stirring and thought-provoking, offering a striking contrast with Kristin's own romantic experiences.<br /><br />When Sigrid Undset attempted to find a publisher for her first attempt at a Medievally-set novel in 1904, she was told: \\"Don't attempt any more historical novels. You have no talent for it\\" (pg. xi). But she was not deterred, and the Kristin Lavransdatter trilogy displays an immense talent for historical fiction indeed, earning Undset the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928. Published in 1920, \\"The Wreath\\" is a masterfully crafted and captivating story. It can be read on many different levels but, unlike much of classic literature, it is also fully enjoyable and self-standing as a story alone. There is no need to dig for deeper meaning in order to appreciate Undset's work, though material for further analysis can certainly be found if one wishes to take a more critical approach.<br /><br />This particular edition (1997 Penguin Classics printing, translated by Tiina Nunnally) is beautifully translated. The words flow so smoothly and the imagery is so vibrant and lively that it's hard to believe it wasn't originally written in English. I have not read the older Vintage Classics translation (entitled \\"The Bridal Wreath\\") myself, but the students in the European literature course for which I read this book that were unfortunate enough to purchase that version all expressed frustration at how difficult it was to read. I can assure you that the Penguin Classics version isn't challenging at all, and would highly recommend it.

This is a difficult book for me to assign a rating to. Most potential readers will already be at least somewhat familiar with the story of Queen Elizabeth I and Sir Robert Dudley, so I will not go into a detailed plot summary here. Suffice to say that \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" is a fictionalized account of this romance, depicting the love triangle between Elizabeth, Robert, and Robert's wife Amy. It was certainly interesting and kept me turning the pages. It is well written, and at the same time easy to read. The storyline works as far as its status as a novel goes. And as for being historical fiction, it is clear that Gregory did her research and did not alter any solid facts. Yet, at the same time, there are many things about \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" that rubbed me the wrong way.<br /><br />There is no single clear protagonist. The omniscient narrator switches between the points of view of Amy Dudley, Robert Dudley, Elizabeth, and William Cecil. Since each of these four had personal interests and aspirations that conflicted with those of the others, it is impossible to root for any one of them above the rest. This is complicated even further by the fact that none of them are portrayed as being truly likeable. Certainly each had their faults in real life, but Gregory's depiction of them just didn't seem to fit the descriptions that I've read in various non-fiction accounts and, reading the story, I got the distinct feeling that I wouldn't want to be around any of these characters in real life.<br /><br />Elizabeth is portrayed as wishy-washy and almost entirely dependent on the men around her. Certainly the real Elizabeth did owe a lot to her advisors, but she was also intelligent, strong-willed, and independent, none of which is evident in Gregory's Elizabeth. And certainly the real Elizabeth was very much in love with Lord Robert, but I just cannot believe that she simpered and deferred so completely to him as Gregory's Elizabeth does, allowing him to make nearly all her decisions for her and to act as her husband and superior in all but name. The real Elizabeth would never have jeopardized her crown by being as excessively foolish as this fictional Elizabeth proves to be. I also don't believe that she would have knowingly condoned the murder of Amy Dudley, especially considering how long it took and how agonizing it was for the real Elizabeth to finally order the execution of her cousin and rival monarch, Mary, Queen of Scots, who plotted against her life. If Amy was indeed murdered, it is almost impossible for me to believe that it was with Elizabeth's knowledge and, much less, approval.<br /><br />Robert Dudley is also painted most unflatteringly. The real Dudley was undoubtedly ambitious, but at many points in this fictionalized account it seems to be implied that he covets the crown of England above all else, and that he is merely using Elizabeth as a tool. The relationship between himself and Elizabeth, in this book, boils down almost entirely to a combination of intense physical lust and Dudley's desire to be King of England. Gregory's Dudley often treats Elizabeth with behavior absolutely unfitting to be shown toward a Queen and, what's worse, she takes it without complaint! Dudley is also so exceedingly cruel to his wife that it is nearly impossible to feel any compassion for him, despite the fact that Gregory seems to intend for the reader to do so.<br /><br />And while it is easier to empathize with Amy Dudley than with her husband, she also proves to be a character without many admirable traits. She is a victim of her husband's cruelty, to be sure, but she does little to recommend herself. She is weak, naive, childish, stubborn, and lacking in common sense. She is not very in tune with her husband's moods and tastes, and so it is not very surprising that he gets frustrated and angry with her as often as he does. I also have a hard time swallowing Gregory's theory on the manner of Amy's death. Of course we cannot know forsure what happened, since the mystery was never solved, but it's difficult for me to believe that Elizabeth okayed her assassination as a means to weaken Lord Robert's position.<br /><br />The flip side of all this, however, is that if this book were purely a work of fiction, and not based on real historical people and events, I would probably give it a rating of four. It truly is a captivating story, and well told. If you are not a stickler for accuracy, this is a highly enjoyable novel. Gregory's theory on Amy's death does indeed make a great conspiracy story, and the love triangle between Elizabeth, Robert, and Amy as presented here makes a great romantic tragedy. It might have been more effective if Gregory had altered the story and characters to make them entirely fictional, as it is only the constant comparison by the reader with actual historical events that undermines Gregory's great writing. And the writing is great, captivating the reader and creating tension and intrigue between the characters.<br /><br />I purchased this book for two reasons. First, I had previously read Gregory's novel \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and enjoyed it immensely. It is not perfect, historically, either, but I found it much more plausible than \\"The Virgin's Lover.\\" And secondly, I have always been fascinated with Queen Elizabeth I, and the idea of a fictionalized interpretation of her early life and relationship with Robert Dudley intrigued me. While the writing here was just as good as in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" the characterization of the main players was disappointing. I would still recommend \\"The Virgin's Lover,\\" but with reservations. Your enjoyment will depend on the degree to which you demand historical accuracy.

While the writing here was just as good as in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" the characterization of the main players was disappointing. I would still recommend \\"The Virgin's Lover,\\" but with reservations. Your enjoyment will depend on the degree to which you demand historical accuracy. I view \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" as a better book, and would recommend it more highly than this one.	2005-01-19

When I found this book on the reading list for my European literature class, and once I'd read a synopsis of the story, I wasn't expecting to like it much. And initially I was a little put off by the protagonist's melodramatic way of expressing himself, but by the time I'd finished the book, my opinion had changed drastically. I don't usually go in for tragedies, but this one is somehow different. \\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\" is the tale of a young man, Werther, who seeks a new life by moving to a pretty country town and immersing himself in the beauties of nature. Once there, however, he meets and falls in love with Lotte, a young woman who happens to be already engaged to another man.<br /><br />The story is told mainly in the form of a series of letters written by Werther to a close friend, William, whom we never actually meet, and occasionally a few other individuals, including Lotte. Each letter is dated and we see the progression and deterioration of Werther's mental state from infatuation, to love, and then to destructive obsession and despair. Toward the end of the book, shortly before Werther's depression finally drives him to take his own life, the narrative style abruptly switches to third person, allowing us for the first time to see the thoughts and emotions of other characters without having them first filtered through Werther's unreliable perception. And the viewpoints of those around Werther give us critical insight into the manifestations of his mental state.<br /><br />Over the years this book has sparked much concern as to whether it advocates suicide in cases of unrequited love. And indeed there have been cases where individuals were motivated to take their own lives after reading this story. However, those who draw such a message from \\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\" are, I believe, misinterpreting the work. Though the protagonist does indeed commit suicide, his act is not glorified (just look at the pitiful way in which his death is described) and nowhere does Goethe make any commentary on whether suicide is right or wrong in such a situation.

Rather, Goethe simply explores the human heart and emotions, presents his findings, and leaves the reader to draw their own conclusions.<br /><br />Despite being a first novel, \\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\" is beautifully written. Even in translation it is clear that Goethe had a powerful command of the written word. And it is quite plausible to believe that the depth and intensity of emotions expressed in the work are a result of Goethe's own experiences with unsuccessful romances. If you go on to read anything about Goethe's own life, you'll see that there are many parallels to be found with Werther's story.<br /><br />\\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\" really gives readers a lot to think about.

McNeill's book \\"Plagues and Peoples\\" provides a thorough and original look at how epidemic diseases have shaped the course of human history. McNeill begins by describing the basic patterns of disease spread and how epidemics generally affect human population and activity, including war, religion, colonization, trade, politics, economics, etc. In a community previously unexposed to a particular disease, the effects can be devastating, killing off vast numbers. In communities where a disease has been encountered before, however, individuals who have been exposed usually have developed some level of resistance and either do not contract the disease again or, if they do, the symptoms tend to be far less severe.<br /><br />In a community where a particular disease has established itself and attained endemic status (i.e. it is constantly present in the population, to some degree, as opposed to an epidemic that strikes and then disappears after a time), it becomes primarily a childhood disease, due to the fact that young children are usually the only ones in the population who have not been exposed and have therefore not had a chance to build any resistance. Examples of diseases that have attained such an endemic status include chicken pox, measles, and mumps, among others. McNeill also makes an interesting point that, for a disease to become endemic in a community, the population thereof must remain above a certain threshold number, below which there would not be a large enough body of unexposed, susceptible individuals to allow the continual perpetuation of the disease. For example, \\"the critical threshold below which [measles] cannot survive falls between 300,000 and 400,000 persons\\" (pg. 78).<br /><br />One of the themes McNeill addresses throughout the book is the balance between what he calls \\"microparasitism\\" and \\"macroparasitism.\\" The former refers to the parasitism of humans by infectious organisms such as bacteria, viruses, worms, etc. The latter is a term the author has applied to the way in which humans \\"parasitize\\" other humans via war, colonization, tax systems, etc. The book draws many parallels between the two, making it apparent that humans can have much the same effect on their own kind as do microscopic invaders.<br /><br />McNeill works in chronological order from ancient times to modern day, describing different outbreaks of various diseases and the impacts they have had. There is little information on most of the older epidemics, simply due to the fact that few, if any, clearly written records exist from times long ago. In addition, it is often impossible to identify an ancient disease with a modern one based on available records. Though the term \\"plague\\" is assigned to many of the epidemics described in the Bible, it is unlikely that these outbreaks were instances of the bubonic plague that popularized the term centuries later. Once record-keeping became standard procedure, however, information was much easier to obtain.<br /><br />A large section of the book is devoted to discussion of the infamous Black Death that first ravaged Europe from 1346-1350, and continued to return for repeat epidemics for several centuries afterward. McNeill explores the origins of this plague in other parts of the world and means by which the causal bacillus was transferred to European countries. Other diseases discussed include smallpox, chicken pox / shingles, measles, mumps, cholera, typhus, malaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, leprosy, yaws, syphilis, poliomyelitis, and various parasites such as blood flukes. \\"Plagues and Peoples\\" was originally published in 1976, so the main body of the text does not include information on AIDS, but the updated 1998 edition has an added preface that briefly discusses the recent impact of this disease.<br /><br />The last section of the book is devoted to the impacts modern medicine, since 1700, has had on the age-old patterns of epidemic infection. The two practices which seem to have had the greatest impact are quarantine and inoculation. Once people began to understand the nature of contagion between human beings (opposed to the previous \\"miasma\\" theory that bad vapors from dead bodies caused infection), quarantine measures became at least partially effective in stemming the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis, sufferers of which were often sent off to sanatoriums. Inoculation, first put into widespread use to combat smallpox, allowed individuals to build up immunity by exposure to a small, non-lethal dose of a particular antigen.<br /><br />Many of the conclusions McNeill draws from his examination of epidemic diseases are based largely on circumstantial evidence, due to the aforementioned lack of detailed documentation of early outbreaks, but they are all very logical and plausible, despite sometimes going against long-established ideas. All the hypotheses offered here are backed up by thorough research and clear cause-and-effect analysis based on the standard patterns epidemic infections tend to take. McNeill does not delve too deeply into the specific symptoms of each individual disease he covers, but rather spends his time discussing the broader, large-scale effects these epidemics had on human history. The book is fascinating, and is also very readable. Highly recommended to anyone interested in the history of disease.ad the greatest impact are quarantine and inoculation.

This is the kind of book that defies the reader to put it down. I read the entire second half in one sitting, staying up until about 4:00 in the morning. I had the same experience when I read Connie Willis's \\"Doomsday Book\\" and was glad to find \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" equally captivating. It is a hard book to categorize. It is science fiction, but at the same time it is historical fiction, and thrown into the mix are elements of satire, comedy, mystery, and romance. It is hard to imagine any author combining all of these successfully, but Willis pulls it off without a single hitch.<br /><br />The protagonist, Ned Henry, is an historian from the year 2057. He spends his days traveling back and forth between 2057 and 1940, where he has been sent to investigate a hideous vase known as the bishop's bird stump that disappeared when Coventry Cathedral was destroyed during an air raid. The cathedral is being re-built, and patroness Lady Schrapnell is a stickler for accuracy, wanting everything in the new Coventry Cathedral to be just as it was immediately before the bombing. But Ned is exhausted, suffering from a condition called time-lag, brought on by excessive time travel. His superiors decide that the best thing would be to send him back in time to 1888, the Victorian era, for a rest. But they have an additional motive as well. Fellow historian Verity Kindle has brought an item from the Victorian era back to the present, something which is not supposed to be possible, and which could alter the course of history. Ned, therefore, is instructed to return this item to its owner in 1888, and then spend the rest of his time recovering. But Ned is already so time-lagged that he misses half of his instructions and arrives in Victorian England with no idea what he is carrying or what he is supposed to do with it. Meanwhile, the entire space-time continuum may be in jeopardy.<br /><br />The story is just as complicated as it sounds, and for a while I had doubts about whether Willis would be able to tie all the various threads together into a satisfying, plausible whole. But I should not have worried. Though some parts of the plot stretch the imagination a bit, the resolution makes everything fall perfectly into place. I am generally not a big fan of science fiction mainly for the reason that I find it hard to suspend my disbelief, but Willis is one of the few authors I've encountered who manages to make time travel seem entirely possible and absolutely logical. Her use of chaos theory as a framework for the events of the story is fascinating. If you're at all interested in themes like this, \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" will suit you perfectly and keep you thinking long after you finish reading.<br /><br />Despite the complexity of the plot, the story is also choc full of humor. Ned has not studied the Victorian era in much detail and does not have time to do so before being hurriedly shipped there to escape Lady Schrapnell. It is highly amusing to watch him fumble along, trying to figure out the detailed etiquette of the period. And at the same time Willis pokes fun at these rigid social customs. Some scenes are almost farcical and it was all I could do not to laugh out loud. This is definitely a book for any reader, on any occasion. It is thoughtful, it is funny, it is well-written, and Willis's characters are some of the most likeable you could hope to find.

It contains 54 images of adorable cats asleep in all kinds of places and positions. All the photos are beautifully shot. Each is accompanied by a quote related to sleep, relaxation, etc. Some of the quotes are actually cat-related, and others are applicable to life in general, but each quote fits perfectly with the picture it is matched with. One of my favorites is: \\"If there were to be a universal sound depicting peace, I would surely vote for the purr\\" (pg.15 - Barbara L. Diamond). How true! Anyone that loves cats knows how soothing their company can be. This little gem of a book would make a great gift for a cat-loving friend, and you'll probably want to grab one for yourself as well.	2004-12-21

He has never had to work for his living, or do a single task for himself. All that changes when the ferry-steamer Martinez, running across the mouth of the San Francisco Bay, is wrecked after a collision with another boat in the fog. Van Weyden is tossed into the sea, and eventually picked up by another boat. But this is no ordinary boat. It is the Ghost, a seal-hunting schooner captained by Wolf Larsen, who is far from being an ordinary man. He snickers at Van Weyden's offers of money in exchange for taking him to shore, and instead conscripts the unfortunate man to replace a recently-deceased member of the Ghost's crew. Van Weyden's trials encompass far more than merely learning how to work on a ship. He must also find his place in the strange web of heirarchy among the men. More precarious yet is his relationship with the captain.<br /><br />We soon find out that Wolf Larsen is a monster of a man, possessing superhuman strength and a complete lack of deference to any idea of morals. He is certainly one of the most fascinating characters I've come across in my reading. You fear him, you hate him, and yet there is still something to admire about him. He commands respect. He can kill a man with the strength of his hands alone, but he is also something of a self-educated philosopher. He has clearly studied Darwin, and continually likens life to a ferment of yeast, in which the natural way of things is for the stronger to consume the weaker. And yet, despite Larsen's superhuman image, London manages to keep him plausible for the reader by giving him his own Achilles's heel, which becomes more and more apparent as the story progresses. \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" is worth reading for a character study of this man alone. Unfortunately, however, the second half of the book shifts its focus, losing sight of the Van Weyden-Larsen relationship and simultaneously losing much of the driving force behind the story.<br /><br />Almost as soon as Maud Brewster entered the story, I began to lose interest. Shipwrecked and adrift in a small boat, she is picked up by the Ghost much as Van Weyden was. She, too, is refused passage to land. And inevitably, a romance develops between Brewster and Van Weyden. The story makes an abrupt change in course from one of survival and complex relationships between the ship's men, to that of a love story. But what a silly and unconvincing love story it is! London just doesn't write women well, nor does he make the relationship between Van Weyden and Brewster in any way believable. Maud is a flat character, and just doesn't seem real. She is also full of ridiculous contradictions. She is alternately described as a frail lily and a cavewoman. She bestows the name of Lucifer on Wolf Larsen, but turns all to pity and mush the moment he is struck by one of his headaches. The story would have been much better with romance left out and the focus kept on Van Weyden's personal struggle with Larsen.<br /><br />The strength of this book definitely lies in its first half. London's writing is strong and vivid, and he does a superb job of capturing the nuances of each relationship between crew members. I only wish he had stuck to that. Every writer has his niche, and London's is not in the romance genre. The second part of the book is contrived, predictable, and does little to hold one's interest. The ending is dissatisfying. It is, however, worth finishing in order to discover what end comes to the aforementioned Wolf Larsen. This is the only element of the latter part of the book that really intrigued me. So read \\"The Sea-Wolf\\" for its adventure component, found in the first half, and read it for the wonderfully crafted character of Captain Larsen.

First, just to let you know what perspective I am reviewing this from, I am a college student, and this text was used in my 200-level introductory biology course. Since I am a student, and not a professor or expert of any sort, I am evaluating the book based on how helpful it was to me in learning the material. For input from biology professors, you'll have to take a look at some of the other reviews here.<br /><br />\\"Life: The Science of Biology\\" has definitely been one of the better biology textbooks I've used. The text is well written, with clear explanations and plenty of real-life examples to help you tie small details into the bigger picture. But beware: The information here is incredibly in-depth, so if you're only looking for a basic overview of biology, you may actually want a slightly simpler book, otherwise you may get lost in all the details. It was perfect for my 200-level class, and gave me all the information I needed, but I don't think it would be the ideal text for an introductory biology course. One other reviewer here mentioned that she used this text to teach her AP biology students. I took AP biology in high school (and got a 5 on the exam) and can guarantee you that this text contains far, far more than you would ever need to know to get a perfect score. It's definitely a college level text.<br /><br />The book has numerous detailed, well-labeled diagrams that are helpful in understanding different processes. In fact, being a rather visual, hands-on learner, I sometimes found the step-by-step diagrams easier to follow than the text itself. There are also plenty of great photographs and other helpful images. At the end of each chapter there is a bare-bones overview of key points you should know, and a self-quiz to help you evaluate your grasp of the material. At the end of the book there is an extensive glossary with definitions of key terms.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is one mistake in this book, to be found in chapter 34, \\"Deuterostomate Animals.\\" On page 674, some text from the previous page is repeated, and this in turn means that part of the section entitled \\"Primates and the Origin of Humans\\" is cut off, even ending in mid-sentence. The following page is filled entirely with pictures and diagrams, no text, and then on page 676 where the text starts up again, it skips to the beginning of the next section, entirely leaving out a chunk of information. This is the only place in the book where I found such a problem.<br /><br />There is a website to accompany this text ([...] I never found it necessary to use the site for my studies, but it may be helpful for some. It contains chapter summaries, animated tutorials, text-related activities, self quizzes, suggestions for further reading, and a glossary of key terms (same as the one found at the back of the book). The book is also supposed to come with a CD-ROM. My school's bookstore was selling the books and CDs separately, and I did not purchase the CD and so cannot evaluate its usefulness. I know I learned everything I needed without it, and I suspect the book and website alone would be sufficient for most students' needs.<br /><br />Aside from the glitch in chapter 34, mentioned above, I have found nothing to complain about with this book. I will definitely be hanging on to it for future reference, and highly recommend it to anyone needing a detailed, comprehensive biology text.

The book is also supposed to come with a CD-ROM. My school's bookstore was selling the books and CDs separately, and I did not purchase the CD and so cannot evaluate its usefulness. I know I learned everything I needed without it, and I suspect the book and website alone would be sufficient for most students' needs.    Aside from the glitch in chapter 34, mentioned above, I have found nothing to complain about with this book. I will definitely be hanging on to it for future reference, and highly recommend it to anyone needing a detailed, comprehensive biology text. NOTE: This review refers to the 7th edition of this book.	2004-12-19

I first read the novella version of \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" when I was in junior high school, and remember being profoundly moved by it. I recently decided to revisit the story in full-length form, and it's every bit as powerful as I had remembered, if not more so. Charlie Gordon suffers from phenylketonuria, a form of mental retardation. His IQ is only 68. He desperately wants to be smart, and when offered a chance to be the first human to undergo an experimental surgery that may increase his intelligence, Charlie is enthusiastic. The most recent test subject, a laboratory mouse named Algernon, underwent the surgery with tremendous success, and the researchers expect the same result with Charlie.<br /><br />The story is told by Charlie himself, in the form of written progress reports intended to serve as data for the research team. The early reports are primitive, with terrible, inconsistent spelling and almost no punctuation to speak of: \\"I tolld dr Strauss and perfesser Nemur I cant rite good but he says it dont matter he says I shud rite just like I talk and like I rite compushishens in Miss Kinnians class at the beekman collidge center for retarded adults\\" (pg. 1). Charlie, 32 years old, thinks and writes as a child of six would. After the surgery, Charlie is initially disappointed, having expected that the operation's effects would take place immediately. He grows frustrated, but at last we begin to see changes taking place. The progress reports steadily improve, not only in spelling and grammar, but in substance and comprehension.<br /><br />As Charlie reaches an average level of intelligence, he begins to realize that the world isn't as he originally perceived it. The other men at the bakery where he works, whom he thought were his friends, laughing and joking with him, have actually been laughing at him instead, making jokes at his expense. And as Charlie's IQ continues to climb, to 150, to 185, and onward, he finds himself just as alone and alienated on the other end of the spectrum as he had been with an IQ of 68. The tables are turned. Now it is the rest of the world that cannot understand him.<br /><br />Charlie's progress reports are touching and thought-provoking, revealing a wealth of personal discovery and growth. Keyes has managed not only to allow us to see the changes in Charlie himself, but also to see how Charlie's perception of those around him changes throughout his progression. It's absolutely fascinating. But the story doesn't end there. The researchers' hopes that the experimental results will be permanent are called into question when the mouse Algernon begins to display strange, erratic behavior, an ominous foreshadowing of Charlie's own fate.<br /><br />\\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is heartbreaking, but it is also beautiful, profound, and well worth anybody's time to read. Though successful ways to limit the effects of phenylketonuria, if begun early enough, have been developed since the story was written in 1959, the issues the book raises and the messages it carries are still as compelling as ever. Charlie's story is a stark reminder that all people, despite whatever handicaps they may have been dealt, are still people, with thoughts and emotions of their own, and deserve to be treated as such. The book is both a moving story of self-discovery, and a critical social commentary, and should not be missed by any thinking reader.e spectrum as he had been with an IQ of 68. The tables are turned.

Oyuna, a young girl living on the steppes of late 13th-century Mongolia, was \\"claimed\\" by the horse as a baby, when a mare stepped on her foot, crushing it and leaving her permanently crippled. Her family and clan members believe her crippled foot is bad luck, and Oyuna comes to believe it, too. But despite her family's efforts to keep her confined to the ger, or tent, Oyuna is determined to spend as much time as possible with her family's horses. Riding provides her with a freedom she cannot experience on the ground. On horseback, her lame foot does not matter. She dreams of having a swift horse of her own, and winning the famed long race at the festival in Karakorum. At last her father gives in, offering to buy her a horse of her choice. But instead of the swift horse of her dreams, Oyuna surprises both herself and her family by choosing an old, lame white mare.<br /><br />Over the winter, Oyuna spends all her spare time with the mare, whom she names Bayan, meaning \\"rich with beauty and goodness.\\" Gradually Bayan's leg heals until she is once again sound enough to ride. Oyuna's shamaness grandmother recognizes something special in the white mare, and warns Oyuna that she must never lose her. But when men from the army of Kublai Khan arrive to take horses and young boys into their service, Oyuna is heartbroken when they select Bayan as one of the horses they will take. In order to stay with her beloved mare, she disguises herself as a boy and sets off with the army, thus beginning a journey full of both danger and adventure. Can she manage to overcome the bad luck that seems to follow her crippled leg, and make her own luck instead?<br /><br />This book is an excellent choice for any lover of horses and historical fiction. The language is simple enough that it could be read by anyone as young as 10, but the story is so well-crafted and captivating that it can be appreciated by readers of all ages. I received this book as a gift while in junior high and loved it. Now I am in college and have recently re-read it, finding it just as entertaining as ever. Diane Lee Wilson's prose is simple and clear, but possesses great depth and richness of detail. The story abounds with tradition and symbolism. Wilson intersperses the text with traditional Mongolian words for things like tents, animals, food items, and other objects, but their meaning is easily gleaned from the context, and any lingering confusion is solved with a glance at the glossary in the back. \\"I Rode a Horse of Milk White Jade\\" is a great tale, full of inspiring messages for young readers.

The protagonist is a mixed breed dog, dubbed Mr. Bones by his homeless, schizophrenic, slightly eccentric master Willy G. Christmas. We see the story through Mr. Bones's eyes, and the book opens with dog and master in Baltimore, Maryland. Willy is dying and his goal is to locate a former schoolteacher of his, with two things in mind. He wants to find a good home for his dog, and he wants to hand over his life's writings to someone who will take care of them. He expires halfway through the book, not having reached his goal, and Mr. Bones is on his own. The dog bungles along, and falls in with a short succession of other, temporary owners before meeting a rather unsatisfying end.<br /><br />The major problem with this book is that is just doesn't feel finished. It leaves you unfulfilled and feeling like something was missing from the story. There's plenty of potential, but it reads more like an unpolished draft than a well-thought-out novel, almost as if Auster himself got bored with it and rushed things just to get it done. The story, though plausible, doesn't hang together very well and fails to drive home the messages it hints at. Some parts of the book drag on far too long, like Willy's long-winded and mostly aimless discourses, and those that are interesting are over far too quickly.<br /><br />The characters, too, are mostly forgettable. Though we learn a lot about Willy, he fails to stand out in any way. The other human characters' roles in the story are too short for us to ever really get to know them on more than a surface level. Mr. Bones himself is successful in some ways and a failure in others. Using the point of view of a dog, while it has certainly been done before by other authors, is an interesting angle to take. And the idea of combining both human and canine sensibilities also has potential, but in all honesty it seemed like Auster was trying TOO hard. Mr. Bones's character feels strained, with his canine elements over-emphasized in the attempt to keep him recognizeable as a dog, and his anthropomorphisms being all the wrong ones. He just failed to strike me as a plausible interpretation of the canine mind.<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you scratch at the book long enough and pull together Auster's meandering themes, there are some noteworthy messages set forth here. Among them are statements made about love, loneliness, loyalty, and the human condition in general. And Auster's writing is competent, despite not being employed to best advantage here. The book is easy to read, short, and can be gotten through quite quickly. But in the end, the book simply fails to be very memorable, and there is not much feeling of reward upon completion. It's worth at least one look, but I'd suggest borrowing a copy rather than buying one for yourself.th his canine elements over-emphasized in the attempt to keep him recognizeable as a dog, and his anthropomorphisms being all the wrong ones.

It is surprising that Jimmy Winkfield's name is not more well known, in light of all the amazing things he accomplished during his long lifetime. Winkfield was the youngest of seventeen children, born in Kentucky in 1880. His parents died while he was young, and he had to support himself at an early age. From modest jobs like shoeshining and carriage driving, the five-foot-tall black boy made the transition to riding racehorses, a career which would shape his entire life and take him on an amazing journey. When he began riding, a fare share of Winkfield's fellow jockeys were black, but over time they began to disappear. The jealousy and racism of their rival white riders drove many out of the profession. Others moved abroad to try their luck elsewhere. Winkfield, who loved horses and is quoted as having said he would die if they were taken away from him, chose the latter option, but not before winning back-to-back Kentucky Derbies in 1901 and 1902.<br /><br />Leaving America, Winkfield traveled first to Poland, and then to Russia, where he was known as the \\"black maestro\\" and enjoyed even more success than he had had at home. In fact, he would become \\"the winningest jockey in the czar's Russia\\" (pg. 228). Among his accomplishments there is the capture of no less than four runnings of the All-Russian Derby, as well as the Emperor's Purse and two runnings of the Moscow Derby. While there was still racism to be found in Europe, the situation was less sinister and Winkfield was seen more as a curiosity at first, and later a hero, causing racegoers to cast their bets on the jockey rather than the horses he rode. And with good reason: Winkfield had a knack for finding the \\"race\\" in a racehorse and getting it out, and his win record was over 50% at this point in his career - a seemingly impossible accomplishment.<br /><br />When the situation in Russia began to decline with the Revolution of 1905, Winkfield moved on. His career took him through Germany, Austria, and Hungary, in all of which he enjoyed further success, and at last to France, where he won the prestigious Prix du President de la Republique. In the late 1920s, as Winkfield moved into middle-age, he began to taper off his riding career in favor of training, and quit riding altogether at the age of fifty in 1930. The author points out: \\"He retired at twice the age most riders did. By his estimate, he had ridden more than 2,300 winners\\" (pg. 227). He established a training operation in Maisons-Laffitte and saddled quite a number of winners.<br /><br />But with the emergence of Adolf Hitler and the beginning of World War II, Winkfield would face a whole new set of challenges. His farm was confiscated by the Germans, and Winkfield returned to America in 1941 with only $9 to his name. The former star jockey and successful trainer was reduced to working a jackhammer on the streets of New York at the age of sixty-one. After the war, however, Winkfield was able to return to France and rebuild his farm at Maisons-Laffitte. After a life filled with unprecedented adventure, and establishing himself first as the last great African American jockey and an international champion, and next as a successful trainer, Jimmy Winkfield died in his sleep in 1974, at the age of ninety-four. He is one of only three black jockeys that have been inducted into the horse racing Hall of Fame.<br /><br />\\"Wink: The Incredible Life and Epic Journey of Jimmy Winkfield\\" was a fascinating read. I must admit I had never heard of Jimmy Winkfield before I came across this book, and I suspect there are many more like myself, but as author Ed Hotaling (who admits to not having any idea who Winkfield was when he saw the man in person in Paris) says, \\"after reading his story, you will never forget him\\" (pg. x). The prose flows easily and does this amazing jockey all the justice he deserves.<br /><br />My only criticism of Hotaling's book, actually, is that in some places Hotaling goes a little overboard in his praise. Winkfield was certainly worthy of all the good things said of his career, but whenever the author discusses Winkfield in his role as a less-than-perfect family man - he cheated on his first wife, abandoned his second, cheated repeatedly on his third, fathered several children with his mistresses (and refused to help support these children financially), and treated his nephew, with whose care he had been entrusted, as something of a male Cinderella, leaving him home to do chores while the rest of the family went on outings to see movies - Hotaling comes across as being eager to gloss over these shortcomings and find excuses for Winkfield's behavior. The book would have been a bit more effective if the author had simply documented these facts and let them be, rather than trying to prettify things and lay the blame on others as he does.<br /><br />Overall, however, I did enjoy the book very much. In addition to relating the many adventures of Winkfield's own life, Hotaling provides a wealth of background information that paints a vivid picture of life in both Europe and America at each stage of Winkfield's career. We learn much about the history of racing and of black jockeys, as well as gaining insight into broader historical events such as the Russo-Japanese War, the Revolution of 1905 in Russia, World War I, the Russian Revolution, and World War II, all of which impacted Winkfield's life and career. There is also plenty of interesting material on how racing and life in general in each of the countries where Winkfield rode compared to one another. The story is both impressive and inspiring.

Robert William Service (1874-1958), the son of a Scottish banker father and English mother, moved to Canada in 1896 at the age of twenty-two. After a failed attempt at farming and several years of drifting, he got a job with the Canadian Bank of Commerce in the Whitehorse, Yukon Territory in 1904, and was later transferred to Dawson. During his time in Canada, Service wrote numerous poems about life in the north. Though the Klondike Gold Rush had been mostly over by 1898, tales of it still abounded and from these he drew much of his inspiration. His first book of poetry, \\"The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses,\\" was published in 1907 (printed under the title \\"Songs of a Sourdough\\" in London), and was followed in 1909 with \\"Ballads of a Cheechako.\\" In 1912 Service left Canada to take a job as war correspondent in the Balkans. He continued to write poetry, but moved on to other subject matter and did not return to Canada. Eventually Service ended up in France, where he married and resided until his death.<br /><br />An Alaskan by birth, I grew up on Robert Service's poetry. My father read selections to me at bedtime when I was little, and I was fortunate enough to hear some professional dramatic readings of Service's work as well (if you're ever lucky enough to get such an opportunity, don't pass it up!). His poems perfectly capture life in the frozen north. His imagery is so vivid that you can see the rugged beauty of the wilderness in your mind's eye as you read. You can feel the biting cold of winters, too: \\"You know what it's like in the Yukon wild when it's sixty-nine below; When the iceworms wriggle their purple heads through the crust of the pale blue snow; When the pine trees crack like little guns in the silence of the wood; And the icicles hang down like tusks under the parka hood\\" (pg. 131, from \\"The Ballad of Blasphemous Bill\\"). Someone who's never been very far north can't fully imagine what it's like, but Service's words will get you as close as is possible, short of an actual trip.<br /><br />Service's work also encapsulates the spirit of the men who roamed the Yukon during the Gold Rush era. The wanderlust, the loneliness, the foolish enthusiasm, the futility, the madness and the insanity - it's all there. You'll feel \\"half dazed, half crazed\\" yourself as you read some of these pieces. It's like a window into the past, into another time and place. And what makes Service's work even greater is his magnificent wit. The poems are full of dark, morbid humor, and laced with irony. \\"The Ballad of Hard-Luck Henry\\" (pg. 112) is a great example.<br /><br />This particular book, \\"Best Tales of the Yukon,\\" is a combination of poems from Service's first two books, \\"The Spell of the Yukon\\" and \\"Ballads of a Cheechako.\\" It consists entirely of pieces written during his Canadian period, and the editors have arranged them so as to provide a \\"chronological saga of the Gold Rush\\" (pg. ix). They've done a magnificent job, beginning with \\"The Men That Don't Fit In\\" (pg. 14) and closing with \\"The Law of the Yukon\\" (pg. 145) and \\"Lost\\" (pg. 150). In between you'll find \\"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\\" (pg. 57) and \\"The Cremation of Sam McGee\\" (pg. 126), the two that would become his most famous and most frequently recited poems. My other favorites include \\"The Trail of 'Ninety-Eight\\" (pg. 28), \\"The Spell of the Yukon\\" (pg. 119), and \\"The Ballad of Blasphemous Bill\\" (pg. 130). All in all, there are 47 great poems for you to sink your teeth into. There is also a useful glossary at the back, offering definitions of the various Yukon-isms sprinkled throughout Service's work.

This is undoubtedly one of the best books I've read this year. Told from the perspective of a 15-year-old autistic boy, Christopher Boone, it opens with Christopher finding the body of his neighbor's poodle, Wellington, impaled upon a garden fork. Christopher likes dogs and so, using the legendary Sherlock Holmes as a role model, he decides to \\"do some detecting\\" to find out who killed Wellington. As the story progresses, however, it becomes clear that Wellington's death is only a small part of a much bigger problem, one that reveals some devastating truths about Christopher's own family.<br /><br />What sets this story apart, and makes it more than just a growing-up tale of a teenage boy with a dysfunctional family, is the unique point of view we are given by seeing the world through Christopher's eyes. His autism results in an inability to intuit normal human emotions. He does not automatically read others' facial expressions as a non-autistic person would. He can tell if someone is happy or angry or sad, but only by comparing what he sees to what he has been taught about the meanings of different body language signs. When he hears a joke, he knows from an analytical standpoint why it is funny, but he does not have the gut-level reaction that most people would. To him, it is more like solving a logic problem. He also cannot stand to be touched. Hugs and other physical contact are painful for him, so instead he gently touches fingertips with the other person as an alternate way of showing affection.<br /><br />This book was of particular interest to me because I had never really known much about autism before. The only autistic person I've ever met was also deaf, which adds an additional layer of complication to things and made it hard to tell what behavior traits were due to the autism and which were due to the added difficulty of not being able to hear. Moreover, I was only in elementary school at the time, so my own perspective on people and the world was not yet fully developed. But now, reading Haddon's book, I have been able to gain a much better understanding of autism, and that actually from an autistic point of view.<br /><br />Christopher's mind is truly fascinating. Despite his social ineptitude, he his highly intelligent, especially when it comes to math and logic. But his logic is not quite the same as an ordinary person's logic. He takes everything literally, and does not understand metaphors, labeling them all \\"lies\\" because \\"imagining an apple in someone's eye doesn't have anything to do with liking someone a lot\\" (pg. 15). Christopher is also remarkable in that he is the first and only student at his \\"special needs\\" school to take the A-level mathematics examination. His ability with numbers is amazing. In fact, when he is overwhelmed with something, he does complicated math problems in his head to calm himself down.<br /><br />\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is a book I'd recommend to just about anyone. The prose is simple and easy to read, but packed with thought-provoking material. Despite Christopher's own inability to relate to human emotions, Haddon's great writing has enabled us to relate to him, and it is a highly emotional story. The text is also interspersed with numerous drawings, charts, maps, diagrams, and other graphics that Christopher uses to help tell his story. Once I picked up this book, I simply couldn't put it down. Truly a creative and insightful modern masterpiece.d.

Horse of the Year, the most prestigious of the Eclipse Awards, is an honor that traditionally goes to male horses. There is no rule that says this has to be so, but year after year it is nearly always won by a colt. Only ten fillies and mares in the history of American racing have managed to come away with the title. Those ten outstanding females are profiled here in yet another excellent book put out by the staff of \\"The Blood Horse.\\"<br /><br />Official voting for Horse of the Year honors was not begun until 1936, after the eras of the first four fillies included in the book. Miss Woodford, Imp, Beldame, and Regret are, nevertheless, said to have earned the equivalent of the title based upon the general consensus of the racing world at the times they ran. They are included in what is considered a \\"legitimate, although unofficial, list of champions dating back . . . to 1870,\\" compiled by then-editor of \\"The Blood Horse\\" Kent Hollingsworth in 1970 (pg. 8).<br /><br />Miss Woodford, the first filly to earn the Horse of the Year title, was also the first and so far only female to be accorded the honor twice, in both 1883 and 1884. Her career earnings of $118,270 also made her the first horse of either gender to earn more than $100,000 in America. Of 48 lifetime starts, she won 37, placed second seven times, and third twice. By the end of her career she had earned the equivalent of seven Eclipse Awards - \\"one division title for each of the five years she raced and two Horse of the Year honors\\" (pg. 28), proving her a truly phenomenal athlete even by today's standards.<br /><br />Imp, nicknamed the \\"Coal Black Lady,\\" next earned the title in 1899. A homely-looking mare, and the daughter of parents who each raced only once, Imp herself started in an astonishing 171 races, placing in the top three in 126 of them. She was also the first mare to win the $10,000 Suburban Handicap. Imp was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1965, more than five decades after her death in 1909.<br /><br />Beldame, for whom the grade I Beldame Handicap is named, captured the Horse of the Year title in 1904. Bred and owned by August Belmont II, who also bred the great Man O'War, she was the second female to win the Suburban Handicap, and was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1956.<br /><br />Regret was named Horse of the Year for 1915. She was raced only lightly - her heaviest season was in 1917 with four starts, but she attained champion status in three out of the four seasons she ran, winning nine out of eleven starts. Even more impressive, Regret was the first of only three fillies to win the Kentucky Derby (Genuine Risk would win it in 1980, and Winning Colors in 1988). Her two losses were to male horses. She was never beaten by another filly.<br /><br />Twilight Tear was the first filly to be officially voted Horse of the Year, named in 1944. Her career accomplishments include winning the Pimlico Special against the colt Devil Diver, in which she matched Seabiscuit's stakes record of 1:56 3/5, and also besting stablemate and Kentucky Derby winner Pensive.<br /><br />Busher earned the title the very next year, in 1945. She won 15 of her 21 career starts, placed second three times, and third once. Busher won both the Arlington and Washington Park Handicaps against colts, conceding weight to all opponents. Her win in the Washington Park also brought the defeat of 1947 Horse of the Year Armed.<br /><br />Moccasin earned Horse of the Year honors in 1965. The 16 hand, 1 3/4 inch filly broke her maiden by eight lengths and entered every subsequent race of her career as the odds-on favorite. She won eight of eight starts in 1965, and is the first and only female to win the Horse of the Year title at age two.<br /><br />All Along, named in 1983, was the first European to be voted American Horse of the Year. In 1982 she won the Arc de Triomphe in her native France, only 1/10 second off the record time. The author states: \\"By the end of 1983, All Along had become the most popular French female to grace the shores of America since Brigitte Bardot\\" (pg. 131). She was also the leading money-winning filly of her time, earning over $3 million.<br /><br />Lady's Secret, nicknamed the \\"Iron Lady,\\" earned the title in 1986. She racked up 22 career stakes wins, won the Fall Triple in New York in two consecutive years, and distinguished herself as the first female Whitney Handicap winner since Gallorette in 1948. She was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1992.<br /><br />Azeri rounds out the group, her 2002 Horse of the Year title making her the most recently named filly. She is the only one of the ten who never ran against males, but she nevertheless proved herself by winning a string of eleven graded stakes races in a row, including a five-length victory in the Breeder's Cup Distaff. She is the first horse to win the Apple Blossom Handicap three years in a row, and is also the richest American female racer of all time (the book lists her second to Spain, but she now has the lead with over $4 million).<br /><br />Each profile was contributed by a different author, but each is well-written and the book as a whole remains solid and engaging. Also included is information on ancestors' and offspring's accomplishments, pedigrees, and numerous great photos. At the end is a full list of past performances for each horse, excepting Azeri who was still in training at the time of publication. \\"Women of the Year\\" is a quick and easy but fascinating read, and I'd highly recommend it to any Thoroughbred racing fan.rica since Brigitte Bardot\\" (pg. 131).

If you're looking for a book with detailed instructions on how to design Celtic knot artwork, this isn't what you want. Author Courtney Davis provides a little background information about the basic knot patterns used to make larger Celtic designs, but does not say much on how to go about creating your own original patterns. Rather, he has put together a collection of several of his own designs (both original and adapted from historical pieces) and says that the images in the book \\"designed for young and old alike to adapt and colour for their own use\\" (pg. 10). So if you're looking for an advanced instruction manual, keep looking.<br /><br />However, the book is still useful in a number of ways:<br /><br />(1) Beginning artists can do just what Davis advises, and play around with the patterns offered here, making little adjustments to create new designs. This is an excellent way of familiarizing oneself with the way Celtic knotwork is put together. Once you understand the basic structural themes, you can get bolder and start creating your own designs.<br /><br />(2) Artists already familiar with the construction of Celtic knots may still enjoy perusing the patterns in the book while looking for inspiration for their own works. I do this a lot myself, and often incorporate elements of various pieces into my artwork.<br /><br />(3) Children and beginning artists will find that this makes a very nice coloring book. The knots and spirals are full-page black-and-white outline drawings, ideal for coloring. For those using the book in this way Davis suggests, and I agree, that you should photocopy the image you want to work with rather than coloring straight into the book. This way, you can always re-do the same piece in different colors later on.<br /><br />Davis begins the book with a brief introduction to Celtic artwork, including its history, purpose, and use and effect of color. The information is surface-level at best, but still interesting. From here on, the book is divided into two sections as the title implies. The first concerns knotwork, and the second deals with spirals. The sections offer basic information on the structure of knots and spirals, a little more history, and some of Davis's own interpretations on symbolism. There are also approximately 45 patterns for you to work with and draw inspiration from, and at the center of the book can be found 16 quarter-page color examples. Each image is accompanied by a caption explaining a little about the origins of the design.<br /><br />Whether the book will be worthwhile to you depends on what you are looking for. If you want a lot of instruction, you won't find it here. But if you just want a source of possible inspiration, this may be a useful resource to help you generate ideas.the book is divided into two sections as the title implies.

I don't generally go for books in the \\"inspirational / self-help\\" category, but there were a few Chicken Soup books that even I couldn't pass up. The first was \\"Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul,\\" followed by \\"Chicken Soup for the Cat and Dog Lover's Soul,\\" and now finally, one that addresses my favorite creature of all, \\"Chicken Soup for the Horse Lover's Soul.\\" If you are unfamiliar with the Chicken Soup books, they are collections of short (generally 2-5 pages), uplifting, and usually true stories submitted by readers. This particular volume contains 95 such tales, all pertaining to that magnificent animal, the horse. As a collection of short stories, the book can be read at whatever pace you like - an occasional dose here and there whenever you need a pick-me-up, or a consistent one or two stories per day, or even all at once.<br /><br />The book is divided into seven sections: \\"A Special Bond\\" shares tales of the deep and lasting friendships that can arise between horse and human. \\"Horses as Teachers\\" looks at the lessons we can learn from our equine friends. \\"These Amazing Animals\\" honors horses that have gone beyond the ordinary in a variety of ways, including the story of Sergeant Reckless, a little mare that served in the Korean War. \\"Horses as Healers\\" explores the ways in which equines have helped humans overcome all kinds of physical and emotional ills. \\"On Companionship and Commitment\\" is very similar to the first section and looks at horse-human bonds. \\"And... They're Off!\\" is dedicated entirely to stories of racehoreses. And finally, \\"Horse... Cetera\\" pulls together everything that doesn't quite fit anywhere else.<br /><br />Most horse lovers will find much to enjoy in this book. There are a few duds, and a few of the stories are overly corny or sappy, but the majority are truly heartwarming. Some will make you chuckle, like \\"Battle of the Titans\\" (pg. 381) and \\"Trail Etiquette\\" (pg. 388). Others will leave you with a wistful smile, like \\"Confessions of a Horse-Show Father\\" (pg. 394). And others will simply leave you feeling warm and happy, and appreciative of the good things in life, like \\"A Job for Missy\\" (pg. 157) and, one of my personal favorites, \\"Ride the Yule Tide\\" (pg. 291). Being an avid racing fan, I was delighted to see an entire section dedicated to racehorses. Included are accounts of well-known runners like Seabiscuit, Da Hoss, Funny Cide, and even the great race mule Black Ruby, as well as tales of more obscure horses who, nevertheless, have interesting stories to share.<br /><br />\\"Chicken Soup for the Horse Lover's Soul\\" is almost a guaranteed winner for horse lovers. Some pieces are more entertaining than others, and the writing skills of the contributors varies (though the editors have ensured that all the stories are still very readable), but the overall effect is to bring together horse enthusiasts from all walks of life into a solid, well-rounded collection that will leave you smiling and fulfilled. I opted for the \\"occasional dosage when needed\\" method of reading, and each session evoked fond memories of the childhood years I spent around horses, and renewed my resolve to return to the world of riding as soon as I am able (currently a college student with limited funds).

US	46057280	RKLJX73S93DOZ	0451524950	619137395	The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and other stories in The Sketch Book	Books	4	41	42	N	N	Thoughtful collection of observations, essays, and stories.	I must admit I bought this book solely out of a desire to read \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\\" probably the work Irving is most well-known for today. Every year on Halloween, when I was growing up, a small group of friends and I would watch the old Disney cartoon version of the story while we sorted through our candy. More recently, I fell in love with the 1999 live action adaptation \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. I figured it was about time I read the original story to see how these two films stack up in comparison. The rest of the material in the book was of secondary interest to me in making my purchase, but having now read it I can say that, while it wasn't quite what I expected, it was well worthwhile.<br /><br />The title is both apt and misleading by turns: \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and other stories in the Sketch Book.\\" The use of the term \\"other stories\\" led me to believe that it would be just that - a collection of short fiction stories. Not so. There are three pieces in the book which would fit this description - \\"Rip Van Winkle,\\" \\"The Specter Bridegroom,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" - but the rest is a conglomeration of various other types of writing. The title \\"Sketch Book\\" is very appropriate. Irving has, in essence, provided us with a series of short, literary \\"sketches\\" on a variety of subjects and in a variety of styles. The topics vary, but they are also arranged in such a way that one usually flows smoothly into the next, lending a sense of continuity despite the variability of material covered.<br /><br />A large percentage of the book is devoted to the author's observations on life in England, himself, though an American, having spent 17 years there. Some are purely observational, and some have elements of fiction and imagination woven in, as is the case with \\"The Mutability of Literature,\\" an interesting little piece in which Irving imagines a conversation between himself and an old book. Irving also occasionally ventures into the realm of satire. Other topics he explores include the differences between America and England, the role of women, English funeral traditions, Christmas, love, etc. He also did travel pieces, including the interesting \\"Stratford on Avon,\\" which tells of his exploration of places connected with the life of William Shakespeare. Toward the end there are two pieces discussing the lot of Native Americans - not politically correct by today's standards, but offering an interesting insight on the mindsets of the time.<br /><br />I should probably take a little time to discuss \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" itself, since it was my primary motivation for purchasing the book and, I suspect, will be what draws most other modern readers to it as well. If you've only seen the 1999 movie version, do NOT expect anything remotely similar. The old Disney cartoon is much more accurate. It is actually a very short story - about 32 pages in length. Ichabod Crane is a schoolmaster (not an investigator as in the 1999 movie) in the town of Sleepy Hollow, and falls for the young and lovely Katrina Van Tassel. Katrina, however, is also being courted by a rival suitor, Brom Van Brunt. Following a town \\"quilting frolic\\" at which many tales of local superstition are told, including that of the Headless Horesman, Ichabod sets out into the night alone, is beset by a headless rider before he reaches is destination, and is never seen in Sleepy Hollow again. It is left up to the reader to determine what happens to him.<br /><br />The language of the book is antiquated, to be sure, having been composed in 1820, but it is not difficult to read. Irving's writing is very warm and inviting. He does tend to paint things rather romantically, and the England he shares with us is not the England of the Industrial Revolution during which the book was written, but this almost makes it more appealing as it opens up room for imagination. One must also remember that Irving wrotethe pieces in \\"The Sketch Book\\" largely to combat his own depression, a condition he suffered from greatly, and he probably needed a cheerful outlet to distract him. We do, nevertheless, get a glimpse of his more melancholy thoughts in pieces like \\"The Widow and Her Son,\\" \\"Rural Funerals,\\" and \\"The Pride of the Village,\\" all of which deal with death.<br /><br />The last chapter of the book, \\"L'Envoi,\\" is a closing piece that was included at the end of the second volume of the London edition. It is an interesting collection of the author's thoughts on and explanations for his own work. He makes an interesting note on the ecclectic nature of the book: \\"His [the author's] work being miscellaneous, and written for different humors, it could not be expected that anyone would be pleased with the whole, but that if it should contain something to suit each reader, his end would be completely answered. Few guests sit down to a varied table with an equal appetite for every dish\\" (362). Also included is an Afterword by Perry Miller, which offers observations and insights on Irving's life and career.ng wrote the pieces in \\"The Sketch Book\\" largely to combat his own depression, a condition he suffered from greatly, and he probably needed a cheerful outlet to distract him.

Despite the fact that only one novel was ever written about him, Sam Spade is nearly as famous among literary detectives as Sherlock Holmes. However, \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" differs from the Holmes stories and other detective tales preceding it in that it is one of the first to be set in a large urban center - San Francisco - and to deal with big city crime. Most detective stories written prior involved small town and country detectives who dealt more with solving mysteries than solving crimes. Spade is the epitome of the tough, big city private eye, and countless detective characters since, in both book and film, have been created in his image.<br /><br />The plot, involving the theft of a valuable jewel-laden falcon statuette, is not very elaborate, but Hammett's presentation of the story makes it seem so and keeps the reader thoroughly engrossed. The narrator follows Spade throughout the story, but Spade's own inner thoughts are never revealed. We are only told what happens. This way, we see the clues as they appear, but cannot put them together ourselves and are kept guessing. It is not until near the very end that everything begins to come together.<br /><br />In addition, none of the characters are what they appear to be. The book opens with a young woman approaching Spade and his partner to seek their help in investigating a man she claims her sister has run off with. When Spade's partner is shot while trailing this man, however, it becomes apparent that their client has lied about nearly everything, including her own name. Spade must then begin digging to get to the bottom of the situation, and we encounter a whole host of characters just as shady and two-sided as the treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy referred to above. Even Spade himself is duplicitous, playing whatever role is required for him to accomplish the task at hand.<br /><br />Hammett's writing is simple and straightforward, yet still conveys enough detail to make everything come to life. We can see the smoky offices, the shadowy alleys, all as if they were right there in front of us. Hammett is truly a masterful writer. The heavy, overpowering atmosphere of the book will draw you right in and hold you there. Hammett also sticks to a gritty reality throughout the story. Nothing is romanticized, and there is no proselytizing of moral messages. Spade does what he has to do to uphold basic principles - namely investigating and and avenging the murder of his partner - but he doesn't hesitate to stoop to the level of the criminals in the story in order to trap them at their own game.<br /><br />I am one of the few who has not seen the famous film adaptation of \\"The Maltese Falcon,\\" starring Humphrey Bogart, so I cannot comment on the relationship between movie and book. My observations here are purely drawn from the novel itself. I can attest that the book is definitely worth the read, whether you frequent this genre or not - I generally don't, and still found it fascinating in many different regards. The writing, plot, and characters are all original and among the most memorable in literature. \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" is certainly a literary cornerstone and will remain a classic for generations to come.see the smoky offices, the shadowy alleys, all as if they were right there in front of us.

My first exposure to Lewis Carroll's classic children's story was through the 1951 Disney film adaptation \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" which I watched repeatedly as a child. The creative quality of the story never failed to fascinate me, and I kept going back despite my deep-rooted terror of the frightful Queen of Hearts, who always gave me nightmares! However, it was not until recently, as an adult, that I ever picked up the book/s upon which that film was based. In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.<br /><br />The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.<br /><br />The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).<br /><br />The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.<br /><br />What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age. I'd highly recommend the book to any reader - and be sure to get an edition that includes the original illustrations.<br /><br />This review refers to the 2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin.reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does). <br /> <br />The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature.

In some ways I wish I had read it when I was younger, as the book certainly makes a great deal more sense than the movie does (as much sense as a story of this sort can, anyhow), but thankfully this book is unique in that it is just as enjoyable for adults as for children.<br /><br />The story is actually spread across two books, here contained in a single volume. \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" was first published in 1865 and relates the events that take place after young Alice falls asleep during her lessons and dreams of following a white rabbit down a rabbit hole. Alice encounters all manner of strange creatures in her dream, and finds herself in all sorts of curious predicaments where common sense fails and the nonsensical comes to be expected. There is no central, concrete storyline, but rather Alice moves rapidly from one bizarre situation to the next before waking once more and relating the whole adventure to her sister.<br /><br />The second of the two books, \\"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,\\" appeared in 1871 and is very similar in nature to the first, though having a slightly different plot. Here Alice steps through an ordinary looking-glass one day, only to find herself in a world where, if you wish to get anywhere, you must walk in the opposite direction! Walking toward your desired destination only gets you further and further away. Also, interestingly, the land which Alice has entered is essentially a giant chessboard, and she must move through the different squares to reach the other side if she wishes to become a queen (which she does).<br /><br />The characters Carroll created in these two stories are some of the most strikingly unique and unforgettable in the world of literature. Alice herself, based largely on Alice Liddell, a real-life child of whom Carroll was very fond, is a wonderful heroine that you can't help admiring. Throughout all of her backwards and upside-down adventures, she remains ever sensible and analytical, always trying to reason her way out of the most unreasonable situations. Other characters a reader won't soon forget include the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Cheshire Cat, Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Duchess and her peppery cook, the aforementioned Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, the Gryphon, the Red and White Queens, the talking flowers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Sheep, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Knights. Carroll also created many fascinating new creatures in his stories, including bread-and-butterflies, rocking-horseflies, \\"slithy toves,\\" \\"mome raths\\" and more.<br /><br />What I find most intriguing, as an adult reader of these books, is Carroll's brilliant use of wordplay and symbolism throughout the stories. Nearly everything has some sort of double meaning. There are hidden messags and subtle witticisms on every page. Carroll also includes several parodies of what were well-known songs and rhymes in England at the time. Young children will love the books for their fantastic qualities and imaginative inspiration, but most readers will not pick up on the many puns and jokes until they are a little older, so these stories really do have something to offer to anyone, no matter what age.<br /><br />This particular edition (2004 Barnes & Noble Classics printing, with introduction and notes by Tan Lin) also contains several extra \\"goodies\\" in addition to the text of the two books. There is a brief biography of Lewis Carroll, a timeline of his life and career, a fascinating and insightful introduction (well worth the read!), information on various film adaptations, a short story by Carroll - \\"What the Tortoise said to Achilles,\\" commentary on the text by various individuals and publications, and a set of questions designed to aid the reader's thought and analysis of the text.

US	46057280	R8OUWDMSSXMNY	0964991519	413216651	Mustang (American Wildlife in American Spaces)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Exquisite photographic portrayal of America's Mustang.	The primary reason someone purchases a book like this is, of course, for the photography. And for that alone \\"Mustang\\" is well worth buying. The book is nearly 200 pages in length and filled with the truly breathtaking work of photographers John Eastcott and Yva Momatuk. All are full-color, and there are many full-page and two-page spread images. Each is crisp, clear, and beautiful. Mustangs are represented here in every aspect of their being - foalhood, young adulthood, with shaggy winter coats and with sleek summer coats, eating, sleeping, playing, fighting, etc. It's all here. As a conversation piece for equine enthusiasts, this book is unbeatable. As an aspiring equine artist, I have found the book doubly useful as a source of reference photos for my art. There is no shortage of inspirational material. The photos are particularly useful for color reference, as Mustangs of every imaginable color and pattern are included.<br /><br />After one has spent some time enjoying the photography, however, it is also interesting to read the text which accompanies it. Author Sharon Curtin paints a verbal portrait of the Mustang that is nearly as beautiful as the pictures themselves. The text is divided into sections: I. \\"Our Horses, Our Land\\" (an introduction), II. \\"Genesis\\" (the origins and evolution of the horse), III. \\"Family\\" (divided into sections on harem bands, stallions, bachelor bands, grazing, colors, shape / conformation, and language), IV. \\"The Pretty Little Paint Filly\\" (a personal vignette from the author), V. \\"Partnership\\" (the relationship between man and horse), VI. \\"Gathering\\" (the history of Mustang roundups), and VII. \\"In the Wilderness of the Preservation of the World\\" (a conclusion calling the reader to action in helping to preserve the mustang). At the very end is a glossary of horse-related terms used within the book.<br /><br />Curtin's writing is very colorful and lively. Her descriptions are so detailed that, even without the photographs, you could easily picture the world of the Mustang in your mind. The information is presented in such a way that it seems more like you're reading a story than a textbook. And I particularly liked the fact that Curtin punctuates informational passages with short personal accounts of her own, describing things she has seen first-hand in her observation of wild horses. These personal touches are heartwarming and give the text added life.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that the author does not display much actual scientific equine knowledge, and indeed the blurb about her at the back gives no indication that Curtin has any actual education in the area. All she says here is based on personal observation. That's fine to a point, but has its drawbacks. For instance, I would warn a reader to disregard most of what is said here about equine color genetics - it is not accurate. It also seems that Curtin draws some strange conclusions from the facts: \\"Mustang digestive systems are not efficient; nature equipped the animal with strong teeth and the ability to move and eat at the same time safely, in order to encourage a varied diet and adequate nutrition. Since they digest forage incompletely, the seeds of the rangeland are redistributed in their droppings\\" (pg. 100). It seems, however, that for Mustangs this system is perfectly efficient. If it weren't, they would not survive. By redistributing the seeds of what they have eaten, they help replenish the lands on which they live, and this makes the relationship between horse and environment well-balanced. Just because a system would not be efficient for humans or for domestic horses does not mean it doesn't work well elsewhere.<br /><br />Those small quibbles aside, however, I still recommend this book most highly. After all, as I mentioned first, the primary attraction of coffee-table books like this is for the pictures. And the pictures here are exquisite. The majority of the text, too, though fundamental, is accurate, interesting, and very well-written. The combination of text and images cannot help but inspire a deep and abiding admiration for these hardy equine survivors of the American range. \\"Mustang\\" would make a great addition to your own equine library, or a delightful gift for any horse-loving friend.teresting, and very well-written.

Nearly everyone will have seen some of the work of Dutch graphic artist Maurits Cornelis Escher (1898-1970). His woodcuts and lithographs are largely based in mathematics and geometry, and provide endless fascination. Many of the two dimensional images Escher created simply could not exist in the three dimenional world, yet on paper they LOOK entirely plausible at first glance (for instance, \\"Ascending and Descending\\" and \\"Belvedere\\"), and this alone gives the mind of the viewer plenty to ponder. Escher also incorporated tessellations - images composed of repeating, interlocking shapes - into many of his pieces (such as in \\"Reptiles\\" or \\"Fish\\"), and he played with the idea of having different figures in the same composition existing on different planes, despite sharing the same space. For instance, a surface which is the floor for one figure may be a wall for another (see \\"Relativity\\").<br /><br />This particular book is a very nice collection of some of Escher's most well-known pieces, and is very afordable. There are certainly more detailed books on Escher's life and work available, such as J.L. Locker's 200-page \\"The Magic of M.C. Escher,\\" but \\"29 Master Prints\\" is a great alternative for those who simply want something visually stimulating to put on their coffee table, without too much text. Each print covers a full page (and these are large pages - approximately 14.5 x 10.5 inches), and is accompanied by a small amount of text on the facing page, giving the piece's title, date of completion, medium, dimensions, and a short blurb offering insights about the print, written by either Escher himself or one of several other authors. The explanations written by the artist are often delightfully witty. At the beginning of the book there is a short essay by Escher, \\"On Being a Graphic Artist.\\"<br /><br />One disappointment I found was that the print of \\"Metamorphosis III\\" is broken up into pieces to fit it all on one page, so you can't see it end-to-end. I would rather have seen this done as some sort of fold-out. Also, unfortunately, this book does not appear to be available in hardcover, so it is slightly less durable.

US	46057280	R3ESBFG30X759I	0679813438	235012080	The Black Stallion	Books	5	63	72	N	N	No horse-loving child should miss this classic!	As a horse lover from a very young age, this is one of those books that was read to me when I was little, which I later read on my own more than once, and of which I still have fond memories today. The first of Walter Farley's twenty-one books, written while the author was in high school and published in 1941, before he graduated from college, \\"The Black Stallion\\" has become a staple in children's literature. It tells the story of Alec Ramsay and his partnership with a remarkable horse, referred to only as the Black. While returning from a trip to India, Alec's ship is wrecked in a storm, leaving he and the Black as the only survivors, washed up on a small, deserted island. For nineteen days they must survive in that desolate place, and in this time a strong bond is formed between the boy and the wild Arab horse.<br /><br />Once Alec and the Black are rescued by a passing ship, the story takes a different turn. Back in New York, Alec asks a neighbor if he might stable the Black in the old barn on his property. As it turns out, Henry Dailey is a former racehorse trainer, and he immediately recognizes the Black's potential for speed. Thus, man and boy pair up in order to train the spirited horse, hoping to harness his energy and turn him into a competitive runner. At this time the racing world is all abuzz about an upcoming match race between two champion horses, each touted as the best racer in the country, but who have never run against each other. But when the Black shows more talent than Dailey would ever have thought possible, he begins to think that this wild, unpedigreed stallion just might have what it takes to beat them both...<br /><br />The story is a bit far-fetched and idealistic, but it nevertheless makes for one whopping adventure. Farley was an avid horseman and he puts his knowledge to good use here. His descriptions of the proud, fiery Black bring the wild horse magnificently to life before our eyes. The prose is simple and fast-paced, with one event leading rapidly into another, but it still maintains a richness and depth that allows the reader to develop a strong attachment to the main characters. You can really feel the bond between boy and horse, and you can't help but care about them. \\"The Black Stallion\\" is an absolute must-read for any young horse lover. The book has a timeless quality to it, and retains every bit of its magic even for modern readers.<br /><br />After penning \\"The Black Stallion,\\" Farley went on to write twenty more horse stories, most centered around further adventures of Alec, the Black, and the characters that surround them (the exception being \\"Man O'War,\\" which is an account of that famous racehorse's life). I have read every one of these additional books, some more than once, and would recommend them to anyone that has read and enjoyed this first book. I don't know of a single die-hard horse lover that hasn't read at least the first few books in the series, and many adult equestrians cite Farley's books as being what got them interested in horses to begin with.<br /><br />\\"The Black Stallion\\" was also turned into a decent movie starring child actor Kelly Reno in 1979. Fans of the book are advised to check it out, but I strongly recommend against skipping the book in favor of the movie. The movie is good, but it is not entirely true to the original story, and doesn't quite capture the full texture of Farley's creation. The book, as always, is the place to start. It is simply written, and so should be easy for elementary-aged readers to handle. For younger children, the book makes an excellent read-aloud story. It is reasonably short. As an adult reader, I am able to get through it in a couple of hours. One final word of advice: As another reviewer mentioned, if at all possible, try to look for an older copy, with cover art by Pamela Patrick.

US	46057280	R3R9OXD523XL8E	0345342968	383457570	Fahrenheit 451	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A critical look at censorship, just as relevant now as then.	It is ironic that Ray Bradbury's dystopian classic about the horrors of censorship has been on and off various \\"banned books\\" lists pretty much from the time it first appeared. That alone should be enough to pique one's interest. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" tells the story of Guy Montag, a fireman. He doesn't fight fires - he starts them, in order to destroy books and any buildings that conceal them. He's happy with his job and always has been. But an unexpected series of events causes Montag to begin questioning the things he has hitherto accepted as undisputable. First he sees a woman burned alive in her home when she refuses to surrender her books. Then, Montag meets two people who expose him to ideas he has never before considered - one is a young girl, a new neighbor who proclaims herself \\"seventeen and crazy,\\" and the other is an aging professor with memories of a time before...<br /><br />When I first read the book over a year ago, I paid attention mostly to the plot alone, did not give the book as much thought as I should have, and therefore was not particularly struck by it. Re-reading it a few weeks prior to writing this, I concentrated more on the underlying themes of the book and gained a greater appreciation for Bradbury's creation. Originally written in 1950 as a short story entitled \\"The Fire Man\\" and taking it's final, full-length form in 1953, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is just as relevant today as when Bradbury first composed it at the cost of a dime an hour in the basement typing room of the UCLA library. It takes a head-on look at the ways in which censorship dulls the mind and seeks to undermine independent thought.<br /><br />The form of censorship we encounter in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is not the same type of thought control found in books like \\"1984\\" by Orwell. In a way, it is even more insidious. There is no Big Brother figure trying to manipulate the minds of the people. Rather, books are taboo because the people themselves don't want them. The general public has lost all interest in reading. And no one wants that interest revived. Instead, people spend their days in front of enormous, wall-filling television screens. When Bradbury wrote the book, television culture was still in its earlier stages, so the novel shows great prescience when compared with the world of today. Now there are televisions in every home. Televisions are baby sitters, time fillers, background noise. When we're bored, we just turn on the TV and let the real world fade into the back of our minds.<br /><br />In \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" we see this overwhelming dependence on television highlighted as a form of escapism from the reality of the world. Montag's wife spends every waking moment watching \\"the family\\" on the walls of the parlor. If Montag suggests that she do anything else, or even turn the volume down, she becomes distraught. She is literally lost without the world on the screen. It provides an insulation to cushion her mind from facing the darker things that hover just beneath the surface. And Mildred's repeated sleeping pill overdoses are evidence that such darker, depressing thoughts really do await her if she ever stops to ponder the world in which she exists, and just how lacking in substance it has become. In fact, the frequent references to other citizens' suicide attempts give us a clue to the very widespread nature of the problem.<br /><br />These are all things well worth contemplating in today's world. Fewer and fewer people take the time to read nowadays. News can be obtained via television or, as is increasingy more common, via the Internet. Entertainment can be had in the form of movies, video games, and the like. And of those that still do read, simple throwaway novels are becoming keen competition for the classics and other books of real substance. The incidence of depression in our society is increasing rapidly. People are constantly looking for ways to escape the world and to avoid having to think about it.<br /><br />Bradbury's book addresses all these issues and forces the reader to consider where our culture may be headed. Additional insight into the author's thoughts about and struggles against censorship can be gained by reading the Coda and the Afterword at the end, appended to the novel in 1979 and 1982 respectively. In these short passages Bradbury reveals the processes that went into the creation of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and the incidents that inspired and shaped it. He also gives us a heavy dose of irony by relating just how frequently others have sought to censor this very book. Admirably, he has turned down every such request, even at the cost of lost business, and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" remains unaltered from it's original form. The story itself is short, simply written, and can be read quite quickly and easily.

US	46057280	R1L2X6YALQHA8H	0316769487	862964341	The Catcher in the Rye	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A biting look at life through the eyes of a teenage cynic.	This is one of those books that it seems nearly everybody read in high school, except me. There are a lot of great \\"modern classics\\" that I somehow missed out on in school - for whatever reason I was never required to read them - so now that I'm in college I've been trying to catch up on my own. \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is the latest of these that I've completed, and while it didn't stop me in my tracks, it was certainly worth the time spent. The story follows one weekend in the life of sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield, who is disillusioned and depressed by the \\"phoniness\\" of the world, but is at the same time unable to escape and finds himself playing the same social mind games he is so disgusted by. Every time he tries to \\"break out of the mold,\\" so to speak, something else goes wrong in his life.<br /><br />Holden's descent into what can be seen as either madness or simply severe manic depression (the latter seems more likely) begins when he is kicked out of Pencey Prep, yet another school in a long line of high-class institutions where his family has placed him. Not wanting to go home early and inform his parents that he has once again been booted out, he decides to find a hotel in New York City and wait out the last few days of the term. Left alone with far too much time to kill, Holden's mind focuses more and more on the seemingly pointless societal affectations performed by everyone he meets, and which he must play along with himself.<br /><br />Though the story takes place in the 1940s, Holden's disillusionment is very similar to what many teens of today go through at some point or another while growing up. If Holden were a teenager of today, a doctor would probably put him on antidepressants post-haste. He's not the kind of person one would probably like if one were to meet him in person. But by reading Holden's inner thoughts, the reader comes to pity and, perhaps, empathize with him. Even though he despises so much of the world, Holden has good intentions throughout the book. He keeps track of the things that really matter most: he defends a former girlfriend from his predatory roommate, even though all it earns him is a bloodied face; he maintains a fond remembrance of his dead brother Allie, and keeps Allie's old baseball glove close at hand; he makes a donation to a pair of nuns he meets in a cafe; he sneaks home to visit with his kid sister, Phoebe, and is filled with real joy just by doing things to make her happy; and when he sees lewd graffiti on the walls of Phoebe's school, he does his best to rub it out, for fear that one of the children might see it and be introduced too soon to the world he himself is struggling with.<br /><br />Perhaps most heartbreaking of all is Holden's answer to Phoebe's question, \\"Name something you want to be. Like a scientist. Or a lawyer or something\\" (pg. 172). All Holden can think of in the way of a reply is that he'd like to spend his time watching children playing in a field, and be there to catch them if any of them should fall. He doesn't want to grow up and get a real job, and take on the responsibility of adult life - he just wants to be \\"the catcher in the rye.\\" This is perhaps where the greatest number of people will identify with Holden. The fear of growing up and facing real responsibility is something that nags at the corners of nearly every young mind.<br /><br />The book's first-person narration reads just like something a sixteen-year-old would actually write. The slang is, of course, a bit dated, but Salinger has achieved a style that rings strikingly true even today when compared to the workings of a teenage mind. And yet it is still easy to follow. It is ironic that the only subject Holden was not failing at Pencey was English, and perhaps Salinger deliberately crafted his character this way in order to ensure that something written by Holden would be coherent to his readership. The writing is simple, and conveys the not-yet-polished style of a teenager, butat the same time makes for very easy reading.<br /><br />Though I did not read \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" in high school, now that I've finished it I honestly wish I had. It is a work that certainly should be read and contemplated by all teens and young adults. Holden's story can be seen as many different things - social criticism, a satire on teenage life, a cautionary tale - and it is probably a bit of each all rolled into one. Every reader will likely take something slightly different from it. Some readers will identify with Holden, some will pity him, some will feel threatened by or disgusted with him. Some will feel a little bit of everything about him. And the end of the story is somewhat ambiguous. There are hints of what happens to Holden, but we are not told outright, and so it is left up to the reader to reach a conclusion. But regardless of what you may end up getting out of the book, do read it. It is thought-provoking on many different levels, and is definitely well worth the read.easy reading.

Included is the story of Megan, a stray golden retriever that came to him with what appeared to be a hopeless case of heartworm. He promised her that if she made it, he'd keep her, and make it she did, going on to provide miraculous healing powers of her own to numerous other animals Dr. Schoen has treated. Schoen also relates some stories of incidents from his younger life that inspired his decision to enter a career where he could help animals.<br /><br />Part II, entitled \\"Bonding,\\" explores the major ways in which relationships between animals and humans, animals and others of their kind, and even between animals of different species, are developed, maintained, and strengthened. Schoen focuses on four major elements - listening, touching, feeling, and letting go. For each of these topics Schoen has related a series of truly heartwarming tales.<br /><br />Part III, which comprises about half the bulk of the book, is entitled \\"Healing\\" and takes on a slightly more scholarly air. Dr. Schoen has incorporated various methods of alternative healing into his practice for years, and uses things like acupuncture, herbal treatments, and homeopathic remedies in conjunction with standard Western medicine. And he gets results, as evidenced by the numerous examples he gives of such treatments succeeding where conventional Western treatments have failed. He begins by introducing us to acupuncture, explaining how he came to be convinced of its effectiveness, and following this with a section on the different ways in which acupuncture and acupressure can help your own pet. There are also diagrams showing a few of the major acupressure points that he feels all pet owners should know, with explanations of what stimulation of these various points will do.<br /><br />Schoen next explores the world of herbal remedies, again explaining how he was introduced to these as alternative treatments and how they can work to help your pet should Western medicine fail. He includes a \\"Top Nine\\" list of herbal remedies every pet owner should be aware of, explaining what each herb does and how it works, and sharing example cases from his own experience. However, Schoen warns all pet owners to consult a veterinarian or herbal specialist before attempting to treat your pet yourself, as herbs can be harmful or even lethal if used improperly or in the wrong amounts.<br /><br />Next Schoen includes a brief section on nutrition and diet. He details the basic nutritional needs of the average dog and cat, and includes helpful charts that show how much of certain nutrients animals should receive based on their body weight. Also included are a few of Schoen's own recommended recipes for balanced, home-prepared meals for your pet.<br /><br />The final alternative healing method Schoen discusses is the use of homeopathic remedies. Similar in a way to inoculations, except for the fact that they are used to treat rather than prevent illnesses, homeopathic treatments rely on the use of heavily diluted samples of agents which, if encountered in large quantities, would actually cause the symptoms the patient is experiencing. For example, an allergic reaction to bee stings would be treated by crushing the bee, diluting the resulting pulp until only a trace amount of bee residue remains, and giving a few drops to the patient. Though such treatments remain the topic of heated debate, Schoen has repeatedly experienced success with these methods and provides numerous example stories to prove it.<br /><br />Part IV, the final section of the book, is entitled \\"Teachings\\" and eases us back out of the book in much the same way we were drawn in - with a series of uplifting tales about the things animals can teach their humans and each other. Among these things are compassion, forgiveness, transformation, gratitude, sacrifice, and joy. One of my favorite tales was of a small stray cat named Daisy, adopted by a friend of Dr. Schoen's, who could not fully adjust to a life shared with humans until another cat was introduced to the household. The newcomer showed Daisy how to interact with their human companion and helped her overcome her confusion and fear. The very last story in the book takes us back to Megan, Schoen's golden retriever, in her final days at the age of fourteen. Schoen relates how, even in the process of dying, this very special dog continued to teach him valuable lessons about life.<br /><br />This is a book any pet owner should read, particularly those with cats and dogs. However, any animal lover will find plenty of useful material here, as there are also stories of Schoen's experiences with horses, cows, rabbits, birds, and other animals - even a camel. The stories are thoroughly enjoyable, often downright amazing, and the insights and advice offered by Dr. Schoen are invaluable. An owner of five cats myself, the book brought to my attention numerous alternative veterinary treatments that I had now known about before. The writing is fluid, colorful, lively, and very friendly, and the book can easily be finished in a day or two. At the very end Schoen has included an appendix with contact information for various veterinary resources, and also a short list of recommended further reading. I recommend this book most highly to any pet owner, animal lover, aspiring veterinarian, and also to practicing veterinarians looking for additional treatment alternatives.ories to prove it. <br /> <br />Part IV, the final section of the book, is entitled \\"Teachings\\" and eases us back out of the book in much the same way we were drawn in - with a series of uplifting tales about the things animals can teach their humans and each other.

What if nothing had actually happened as the textbooks say? Worse yet, what if everyone, even those teaching this false history, really believed it to be true? Is something true just because everyone believes it to be so? And even if someone did discover the truth, would anyone care? These are the questions author Daniel Quinn tackles in his dystopian novel \\"After Dachau.\\" In some ways it resembles the world George Orwell created in \\"1984,\\" where history is constantly re-written to fit the current agenda. The difference is that, while the characters of Orwell's \\"1984\\" engage in \\"doublethink\\" - a means by which they can simultaneously know something as a fact and also believe it to be false, the characters in Quinn's story have no more reason to question their acknowledged history than you or I would have reason to doubt that Queen Victoria existed or that the New World colonists won the American Revolution.<br /><br />Quinn has chosen as a vehicle for his ideas here the phenomenon of reincarnation, or the transmigration of souls. Note that this book is not ABOUT reincarnation, nor does Quinn himself endorse the idea, despite the fact that it is a central element of the plot. Reincarnation is used here merely as a means of setting up a situation essential to making the reader think about Quinn's central theme - the manipulation of history - but which could not otherwise have occurred. In short, \\"After Dachau\\" introduces us to Mallory Hastings who, waking up after a car accident, has no memory of her present life, but only of her previous reincarnation as Gloria MacArthur, a girl who lived in the 1920s-1950s. Since then, the history of Gloria's own time has been drastically re-written, and only she knows the truth.<br /><br />The revision of history, either deliberate or inadvertant, is something very common. What makes it potentially dangerous is that we often don't realize that what we are taught as fact and what actually happened are not consistent. Now, I'm not speaking primarily of grand conspiracies or even of propaganda campaigns known to be false by those who institute them. Though of course such things have been attempted, these blatant attempts at manipulation are not what we really have to worry about. They are, in general, fairly easy to see through and know for what they really are. The type of historical revision that is potentially more insidious is that which occurs when the writers of history actually believe themselves what they are saying. This can (and does) of course happen quite frequently without much harm done (compare history texts of today with those of a century ago, or two or three centuries ago - there will be differences due to changes in available information at the various times the texts were written). But Quinn's book gives us a big \\"what if?\\": If everyone on earth believes something occurred in a certain way, and believes it to be a good thing, does that automatically make it right?<br /><br />There is a lot to think about in this book. Unfortunately, Quinn has not been nearly so successful in his aims here as he was with \\"Ishmael\\" or \\"The Story of B.\\" In both of those works his message is quite clear and requires little independant thought to understand (though independent contemplation does greatly enhance the experience of reading both novels). In \\"After Dachau,\\" however, his message remains a bit muddied and the book fails to wallop the reader between the eyes and give them the \\"aha!\\" moment that would be most gratifying. The book is filled with important ideas worthy of attention, but the presentation feels much more like a rough draft than a refined finished product. I would still recommend this one to others, but with reservations.<br /><br />\\"After Dachau\\" is very simply written and can be finished in one or two sittings with no trouble at all, but this is a double-edged sword. It makes it easy to simply dismiss and forget about it when one has finished. Simply reading the book at face value and calling it a day will not leave a reader with much satisfaction. The plot itself is secondary to the ideas, and not very compelling in itself. And because the ideas are presented in a more unpolished fashion than in Quinn's other books, they will not grab you unless you grab them. Most of what I got out of this book occurred AFTER I had finished reading it, as a result of my own inner contemplation. I think it could have been a great book, rivalling Quinn's others, if he had spent a little more time developing it before going to publication. As it is, \\"After Dachau\\" is a good book, but falls short of its potential.mply reading the book at face value and calling it a day will not leave a reader with much satisfaction.

US	46057280	R3P12CKIWKD2E5	0156148501	43278951	Burmese Days: A Novel	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Brilliant but devastating look at English-Colonial Burma.	This novel, though not as well known as Orwell's famous &quot;1984,&quot; is political criticism at its best. Drawing heavily on his own experiences in colonial Burma in the early decades of the 20th century, Orwell has painted us an eye-opening and painful portrait of that world. The protagonist is an Englishman named James Flory, living in the small town of Kyauktada. He is different from his fellow English colonials, outcast because of his sympathy for the Burmese and friendship with the local native Dr. Veraswami, and constantly ashamed and self-conscious because of an unsightly birthmark across his face.<br /><br /> Flory is a rather pathetic creature, lacking the courage to stand up for what he believes in and to defend his friend Veraswami from the corrupt local politician who wishes to ruin him. He also falls for a pretty young woman, Elizabeth Lackersteen, probably because she is the only Englishwoman of marriageable age anywhere in the vicinity. She is, in reality, just as shallow and empty-headed as the rest of the English colonials, though Flory fails to see this. And yet despite all this we still sympathize with Flory, because he is the only one who recognizes and expresses disgust at the injustices being done by the English toward the Burmese.<br /><br /> This is a depressing book, no doubt about it. Flory lacks the strength necessary to avert disaster, and disaster is what occurs. Yet &quot;Burmese Days&quot; is a brilliant novel that is well-worth the read, and indeed should by read by everyone. There are few, if any, truly likeable characters in the book, but each serves an important role in delivering Orwell's messages about colonialism, racism, society, and the role of women. Nothing is spared in this biting, cynical, astute look at human nature. The ending is the ultimate irony, and packs the final, depressing punch.<br /><br /> George Orwell is among the best of English writers in terms of creating atmosphere and a sense of realism, and &quot;Burmese Days&quot; is a prime example. The descriptions are so vivid that the Burmese jungles simply rise up off the pages, steaming and sweltering, to greet you. You can almost feel the deadening heat and humidity, the mugginess, the stickiness, and it brings the misery of the characters to life. Orwell's language flows smoothly and achieves its aim to utmost perfection. This particular edition (1974 Harvest Books printing) has a few distracting typos, but not so many that I'd knock down my rating of the book overall. Definitely a must-read.rmese Days&quot; is a prime example. The descriptions are so vivid that the Burmese jungles simply rise up off the pages, steaming and sweltering, to greet you.

US	46057280	R2FRH6PCEA5PE7	1567310079	86598545	Siddhartha	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Subtle, understated, yet profoundly insightful - a must read	Don't let the simple, minimalistic style of Hermann Hesse's writing fool you. While \\"Siddhartha\\" is a short novel and quite easy to read, it should not be taken lightly. What seems at first to be a simple story actually contains numerous layers of thought and meaning, and the end result, if the reader takes the time to seriously ponder the book's message, is a truly enlightening experience. We are first introduced to the main character, Siddhartha, as an adolescent on the brink of manhood (or so it would seem - we aren't actually told what age he is). Siddhartha is the son of a Brahman (also spelled \\"Brahmin\\"), a member of the priestly class in ancient India. However, he has come to feel that there is something lacking in this way of life and is disillusioned with the traditional sacrifices and rituals. Hoping to find the secret to nirvana (release from samsara, the repeating cycle of life), Siddhartha sets out with his friend Govinda on a lifelong spiritual journey.<br /><br /> During the course of his quest for self-discovery, Siddhartha encounters a wide and varied array of mentors. First he joins the ranks of the Samanas, wandering ascetics who believe nirvana can be achieved only when one manages to completely eliminate the Self. After a few years of this life, word reaches Siddhartha of a holy man, Gotama, the Buddha, who is said to have achieved enlightenment while meditating under a bo tree. After listening to the teachings of the Buddha, Siddhartha still does not feel that he has found what he seeks, and his journey continues. His next mentor is Kamala, the beautiful courtesan who instructs him in the art of love. After a while he leaves Kamala and apprentices himself to a rich merchant, hoping to learn the workings of the business world. He soon finds himself becoming enmeshed in the material world of abundance and indulgence. Finally, sick and depressed, he leaves everything behind him and joins up with an old ferryman. It is here, at last, now an old man himself, that Siddhartha begins to piece together the truth about life, compiling all the bits of wisdom his various mentors have given him.<br /><br /> The language itself is uncomplicated. Yet each word is saturated with meaning, and a reader who wishes to get the most from this book will need to carefully examine and reflect on them all. I'd advise against rushing through this one, despite its initial appearance of simplicity. Read a chapter, and then take a little time to think about it. Re-read any parts that stood out for you, or that you did not entirely grasp. It's amazing what you'll pick up. Also, don't be put off by the main character. For much of the book, Siddhartha seems rather distant and alien. He is not a character one can readily identify with. In fact, the only time at which he displays any depth of regular emotion is during his interactions with his son. But all of this has a purpose. Siddhartha is not only alien to us, the readers, but also to himself, and it is not until the last pages of the book that he discovers the secret of what it means to be human.<br /><br /> It may help potential readers to first familiarize themselves with some basic information on Indian history and the origins of Buddhism (if these are not subjects you are already knowledgeable about). The story of Siddhartha is loosely based on the life of the Buddha himself (and interestingly, the Buddha's full name was Siddhartha Gotama - also spelled \\"Gautama\\"). The story contains much vocabulary that the lay-person may not recognize, and a little research beforehand will contribute to one's overall understanding of the book. For instance, \\"samsara\\" is the wheel of life, a never-ending cycle whereby a person will be repeatedly reincarnated, placed in either a better or worse life based on the good or bad \\"karma\\" they have accumulated in the previous life. The state of \\"nirvana\\" is said to be enlightenment and release from the cycle of samsara. There are several other such wordsand concepts that one would benefit from being familar with as well. Understanding of the book does not require a very detailed knowledge, but some small amount of background information is certainly helpful.<br /><br /> On a final note, it is important to realize that \\"Siddhartha\\" is very relevant to modern-day life as well. Hesse, a German author, wrote the book from a Western perspective. Though it takes place in India and is filled with Eastern religious concepts, Hesse has adapted the ideas to make them applicable to Western life. Nor is it a book about religion per se, but about the discovery of self and finding the secret of contentment with one's life. This amalgamation of ideas is what makes \\"Siddhartha\\" stand out among the modern classics as a truly brilliant work. \\"Siddhartha\\" is a book I would recommend to anyone without hesitation. It is one that should be read first in high school, if possible, thought about carefully, and re-read many times throughout one's life. The story has much to offer and carries a powerful message, and will remain one that I cherish for decades to come.<br /><br /> This review refers to the 1997 MJF Books edition, translated by Hilda Rosner.e would benefit from being familar with as well.

US	46057280	R1Z05HPQONBH6E	0671722816	43217624	OTHELLO	Books	4	3	9	N	N	An excellent edition of one of Shakespeare's best tragedies.	&quot;Othello&quot; is one of Shakespeare's most popular tragedies, and since most people, even those who have not read or seen the play before, probably already have a basic idea of the plot, I will keep my synopsis short. The military general Othello is a Moor, a black man, who has just married a Venetian woman, Desdemona. Theirs is a marriage of opposites in many respects - race, age, upbringing, etc. - and yet they have overcome all this and are happy with each other. But Iago, perhaps Shakespeare's most infamous villain, is determined to ruin Othello, who has promoted another man, Cassio, to the lieutenancy, a position Iago feels should have been given to himself. He therefore sets about poisoning Othello's mind against his chaste and loving wife, convincing the Moor that Desdemona has been unfaithful to him with Cassio. The events that follow lay out one of the most masterful and heartbreaking examples of dramatic irony.<br />While I am not usually one to go in for tragedies, I do thoroughly enjoy this particular play. The story is expertly woven, with each twist in the plot simultaneously wrenching the reader's / viewer's heart. We know exactly what is going on, even though the characters do not, and this is what makes &quot;Othello&quot; such a very tragic story. And yet, in the end we are left with a sense of resolution and justice, not merely empty sorrow, and perhaps this is what appeals to me about this play.<br />Nevertheless, I do not think the play is perfect (though my 4-star rating here is in comparison with Shakespeare's other works, and not drama in general; against most other drama I would award it a 5-star rating). While I do think Iago is a brilliant character, I cannot help thinking that his hatred for Othello seems rather disproportionate to the wrongs he thinks have been done against him. He is upset over not being given the lieutenancy, but is this reason enough to bring about so many deaths? There is also the fact that Iago suspects his own wife, Emilia, has been unfaithful with the Moor, but Iago has no actual proof of this. However, this disproportionality is one I am willing to overlook for the sake of enjoyment of the play. What bothers me slightly more is that Othello, presumeably a very intelligent man, would allow a mere suspicion to grow into such an intense state of jealousy when he has no definite proof of his wife's infidelity. One would think he would do some investigation for himself, rather than being content to have Iago feed him all the &quot;facts.&quot;<br />I now wish to comment on the particular edition of this play that I read - the 1993 &quot;New Folger Library&quot; printing, edited by Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine. I have read several of of the Folger versions of Shakespeare's plays, and have found them unbeatable as far as making Shakespeare's works accessible to the layman. The book is laid out with the text of the play appearing on the right-hand page of each two-page spread, while the left-hand page contains textual notes that are of tremendous help in understanding the play. Words and phrases that have become obsolete since Shakespeare's day are defined clearly, and any allusions that would not be obvious to a modern reader are also explained. The fact that one can access these notes without having to flip back and forth through the pages makes it much easier to maintain one's place and train of thought.<br />Another thing I like about this particular edition is that it contains the entire play. Two versions of &quot;Othello&quot; were published in Shakespere's day - a Quarto, which was a small and slightly condensed version, appeared in 1622, and the longer Folio version was published in 1623. Each version is slightly different, containing bits and pieces not present in the other. This printing of the play contains the entirety of both versions combined into one, with brackets around those words that appear in only one or the other of the original printings.<br />Inaddition to the play itself, this book contains an excellent introduction, with information about the play, the language of the time, drama in general, Shakespeare himself, theater in Shakespeare's day, a bit about his other works, and some editorial notes on this particular edition of &quot;Othello.&quot; Thus, even the rankest newcomer to Shakespeare will not be at a loss here, though the book is equally suitable for those already familiar with Shakespeare and his works. At the end of the book is a brief but interesting and well-written essay entitled &quot;Othello: A Modern Perspective&quot; by Susan Snyder which offers further analysis of the play. I highly recommend the Folger editions of any of Shakespeare's plays to all readers. They are wonderful for use in the classroom, and also make it much easier to delve into Shakespeare on one's own.addition to the play itself, this book contains an excellent introduction, with information about the play, the language of the time, drama in general, Shakespeare himself, theater in Shakespeare's day, a bit about his other works, and some editorial notes on this particular edition of &quot;Othello.&quot; Thus, even the rankest newcomer to Shakespeare will not be at a loss here, though the book is equally suitable for those already familiar with Shakespeare and his works.

I received this book as a gift years ago, and until now it's just been sitting by the wayside. I'm always skeptical of people who call themselves &quot;horse whisperers&quot; - while I'm willing to believe there are levels of communication that most of us do not yet understand, it takes quite a bit to convince me that someone who claims to have any sort of telepathic abilities is actually the real deal. Not only that, but the term &quot;horse whisperer&quot; is incredibly hackneyed by now. Ever since the movie of the same title came out, the name has been slapped on just about every moderately successful trainer out there, even though their methods vary widely and don't actually involve any &quot;whispering.&quot; However, when I finally gave the book a chance, I was very surprised. The first two chapters alone had me convinced that Nicci Mackay is something genuinely different.<br />The book is more like a memoir of her experiences communicating with horses (and other animals), and not actually a full biography. She takes up the story in her adult life, revealing the circumstances under which she first &quot;came out of the closet&quot; about her abilities. Believing most people would think her a quack if she ever claimed she could speak with horses, Mackay kept quiet about it for years. She only spoke out publicly when a close friend adamantly insisted that she do so, for the benefit of a particular horse. When she received a surprisingly favorable reaction, the author began offering her services professionally, helping people better communicate with and understand their beloved animals. And though horses are her most common subject, being her favorite animal and the one with which she first recognized her abilities, she has also successfully worked with dogs, sheep, cows, and even birds. The bulk of the book shares with us a series of the author's most interesting and touching cases.<br />Part of what makes Mackay's book so convincing is her down-to-earth nature. She does not come across as pretentious is any way. In fact, she freely admits to not fully understanding her abilities herself, and occasionally suffers doubts about the extent to which any as-yet-untried application will be successful. She never lords her abilities over anyone else, doesn't believe herself to be superior to other horse owners because of her communication skills, and nowhere does she attempt to argue the reader into believing everything she has to say. Rather, she lets the case examples speak for themselves. There is also an abundance of self-deprecating humor, as she shares some of her more comical and occasionally downright hilarious experiences. To me, Mackay's book reads a bit like something a telepathic James Herriot would have written.<br />Amazing as it may be, Nicci Mackay actually seems to be the real thing. Her book is utterly convincing and a joy to read. Mackay is also an excellent writer, and the text is vivid and captivating. Her style is very friendly and open. I wouldn't blame anyone for being initially skeptical - after all, I set the book aside for quite some time for this very reason - but for anyone with an interest in horses to entirely bypass this book would be a great loss. I'd urge any horse lover to give this one a chance, as it will broaden your horizons and is definitely well worth the read.She does not come across as pretentious is any way.

Deceptively short and simply written, John Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; actually offers any reader quite a lot to think about. The relationship between the two main characters highlights a number of issues relating to the themes of mental illness and friendship. The story takes place in Depression-era California. Lennie is a very large, strong man, but not too bright. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body, but because he fails to comprehend his own strength, he frequently does harm to others without meaning to. He loves to pet soft things, like mice and rabbits and puppies, and then becomes distraught when they die, not understanding that he has been too rough with them. Lennie's companion is the brains of the pair, a small man by the name of George. He fills the role of both caretaker and friend to Lennie, and does his best to keep him out of trouble, though he doesn't always succeed.<br />The two men are traveling laborers, moving around as the availability of work dictates. To keep Lennie motivated and obedient, George pacifies him with stories of a future bright with luxury and free from worry. They'll buy a small farm, he tells his avid companion, and live off the fat of the land. They'll have their own crops and their own livestock, and go to shows whenever they feel like it. And if Lennie stays out of trouble, he can even have some rabbits of his own to take care of. Captivated by this vision, Lennie does his honest best to obey George and avoid doing anything that might jeopardize their dream. But his best just isn't good enough, and just when their plans look like they might actually be falling into place, Lennie makes the biggest bungle of all, leaving George with an extremely hard decision to make.<br />One of the social problems Steinbeck seems to be commenting on here is the place of the mentally ill or impaired in society. What was their place at this point in time? Did they even have a place? This story makes it clear that there really weren't many avenues open to the mentally ill at the time. They could be institutionalized, but such places had little merit during the 1930s, when mental illness was not yet really understood. Patients were treated little, if at all, better than criminals. The other option would be for such people to try to get along in the outside world of &quot;normal&quot; people, as Lennie does. When Lennie's Aunt Clara dies, he is left with no family and so falls in with George, who becomes his new guardian. But the outside world is no more understanding of Lennie's handicaps than the doctors of the time, and provides countless pitfalls of its own.<br />The other major theme of the story is friendship. What is true friendship? To what extent does one have responsibility to a friend, and what does this responsibility entail? This is something George must struggle with every day. He feels obligated to care for Lennie and help keep him out of trouble, though he clearly realizes that his own life would be far simpler if he were on his own. In the end, when Lennie commits the ultimate, irredeemable blunder, George must sort through this inner conflict to decide what is best for both of them. Should he continue to protect his companion, or should he save his own skin? And if he chooses to put Lennie's best interests first, what course of action would be the most just? The conclusion he arrives at is both intricately complex and, in another light, quite obviously simple at the same time.<br />Aside from these two overriding themes, Steinbeck also gives us glimpses into other issues of the time, among them racism and labor conditions. On the farm where the bulk of the story takes place, one of the characters is a black stable hand. Nicknamed &quot;Crooks&quot; because of his crooked back, this man is estranged from the rest of the workers (all white). The only one who fails to comprehend why Crooks should be treated any differently than anyone else is Lennie, whose simple mind doesn't grasp the idea of racism. We also see what life was like for Depression-era vagrants, moving from place to place in search of work. The living conditions were not ideal (though those in this story are far from the worst imaginable), the food provided often lacked proper nourishment, and employers could treat their hired help in just about any way they pleased. After all, the laborers were lucky to find any paying work at all. Even if they didn't like the conditions, where else could they go?<br />I'd definitely recommend this book to any reader. Though times have changed somewhat, the issues Steinbeck comments on are still very relevant today. The ideas presented in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; are many and deep, and much time can (and should) be spent contemplating them, but the book remains very accessible. It is a very short story, and can easily be read in one day. The style of writing is simple and direct, while retaining detail and a startling depth of feeling. However, it is by no means a feel-good story, so don't read this one at a time when you're already down in the dumps. While the ending has a very nice sense of resolution, and one is left feeling that George made the best decision he could under the circumstances (or, at least, this is the feeling I was left with), it is still rather depressing.rasp the idea of racism.

In this delightful volume, first published in 1892, William Butler Yeats has collected all manner of Irish folklore (mostly short stories, with a few poems) from a wide variety sources. He has divided the works into categories as follows: the &quot;Trooping Fairies&quot; (fairies, changelings, and the &quot;merrow&quot; or mermaids); the &quot;Solitary Fairies&quot; (the lepracaun, the pooka - an animal spirit, and the banshee); &quot;Ghosts&quot;; &quot;Witches &amp; Fairy Doctors&quot;; &quot;T'yeer-na-n-Oge&quot; or &quot;Tir-na-n-Og&quot; (a legendary island said to appear and disappear); &quot;Saints &amp; Priests&quot;; &quot;The Devil&quot;; &quot;Giants&quot;; and &quot;Kings / Queens / Princesses / Earls / Robbers.&quot; Yeats introduces each section with background information on the creature the stories in that category will concern. He also includes numerous footnotes of interest, making this book a valuable resource for anyone seeking to learn about the tradition of Irish folklore.<br />While I have given this anthology a five-star rating based on it's value as a source of information on Irish mythology, it would probably be worth only four stars for entertainment value alone. Some of the stories are very short and/or don't have much of a point, and are less interesting. These tend to serve more as testimony to the nature of a particular mythical being rather than being an actual story with a plot and message for the reader. Nevertheless, the book as a whole offers a very comprehensive look at just what defines Irish folk culture. The stories that do have a point sometimes take the form of &quot;how things came to be this way&quot; tales, or provide a moral lesson, etc. Many of the stories are rather dark, as that tends to be the nature of lore from this region, but there are also some lighthearted and cheerful pieces.<br />Despite the book having been compiled more than one hundred years ago, most of the stories are quite easy to read. Yeats makes things even more simple for the reader by making footnotes where old Irish words or phrases are used, giving us their meaning. However, there are a few stories that have been left in a more archaic form, which is distracting and a bit harder to decipher. Take, for example, the following excerpt:<br />&quot;. . . the minit he puts his knife into the fish, there was a murtherin' screech, that you'd the life id lave you if you hurd it, and away jumps the throut out av the fryin'-pan into the middle o' the flure; and an the spot where it fell, up riz a lovely lady - the beautifullest crathur that eyes ever seen, dressed in white, and a band o' goold in her hair, and a sthrame o' blood runnin' down her arm.&quot;<br />One of the things I enjoy most about literature is finding connections with other works I've read, and &quot;Irish Fairy &amp; Folk Tales&quot; does not disappoint in this regard. Many of the pieces are derivations of other, more common fairy tales. For instance, &quot;Smallhead and the King's Sons&quot; (Ghosts) incorporates some elements from both &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Hansel and Gretel,&quot; while &quot;The Giant's Stairs&quot; (Giants) has some similarities to the story of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk.&quot; There are more connections like this.

The term \\"Machiavellian\\" is frequently used to describe ruthlessness and brutality in a leader, and most people who have read about Machiavelli but have not actually read Machiavelli's own works assume that he believed \\"the ends justify the means.\\" However, this is a common misperception. His actual words are: \\"[. . .] in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, where there is no court of appeal, one looks at the outcome.\\" He does not, here or anywhere else in his writing, attempt to provide any moral justification for ruthlessness, but merely says that a leader will always be judged by his people based on the end result of his actions. He was very pragmatic in his outlook on princely rule, and sought to explain the actions that would and would not be effective in gaining and maintaining the rule of a nation.<br /><br />Another point of some confusion is the saying that \\"it is better to be feared than to be loved.\\" Again, this is not quite what Machiavelli meant. His actual words are: \\"[. . .] there arises a dispute: whether it is better to be loved than feared, or the contrary. The reply is that one should like to be both the one and the other, but as it is difficult to bring them together, it is much safer to be feared than to be loved if one of the two has to be lacking.\\" It is also noteworthy to point out that the word \\"fear\\" at the time Machiavelli was alive was less synonymous with its modern meaning than it was with the word \\"respect.\\" He was saying that a prince's throne is more secure if he is feared/respected but not loved than it is if he is loved but not feared/respected. Machiavelli does not say that a prince who is feared is the moral better of one who is loved.<br /><br />\\"The Prince\\" is a truly fascinating work of philosophy, describing the ideal conduct (in mechanical and not moral terms) of an effective sovereign. Despite the fact that it is entirely concerned with the government of principalities, Machiavelli himself was a republican, and believed that the most effective form of government would combine elements of a principality, an aristocracy, and a democracy. His motivation to write \\"The Prince\\" came from his desire to ingratiate himself with the Medici family, the ruling power in Florence at the time, and also from his belief that only a single, strong ruler would be powerful enough to unify and liberate a then-factionalized Italy.<br /><br />The book is not an easy read, but is more accessible than, say, Rousseau's \\"Social Contract\\" (I'm not equating the topics of these two books, but just comparing literary style). Machiavelli tends to use very long, complex sentences, and it's easy to get derailed before reaching the end of one. Some of his sentences easily take up a third of a page. Nevertheless, the content of \\"The Prince\\" is definitely worth the time and concentration it takes to read.<br /><br />Readers who do not already have a detailed knowledge of pre-16th century Italian and ancient Roman history will no doubt have additional difficulties understanding Machiavelli's work. Being Italian, he used examples primarily from Italy's political history and from his studies of Rome. Machiavelli also, at times, misrepresents history either inadvertantly, or purposefully so as to better back up his arguments. He also has a tendency to over-simplify things, and does not take into account that real life is rarely as clear-cut as he presents it.<br /><br />While many things have changed since Machiavelli wrote \\"The Prince\\" in c.1513, much of what he says is still relevant to some degree. The basic concepts he presents can be adapted for application in just about any position of leadership. However, it must always be remembered that this book was only meant as a technical guide, and does not attempt to justify itself on moral grounds. \\"The Prince\\" is also a worthwhile read for the reason that it will give the reader a better, more complete understanding of the term \\"Machiavellian,\\" and the abilityto recognize when it is or isn't being used correctly, as well as the ability to use it correctly themself. This is a must-read for anyone interested in political philosophy, and has much to offer whether you agree with Machiavelli's ideas or not.<br /><br />This review refers to the 2003 Barnes & Noble edition, translated by Wayne A.

The title - &quot;Horse Racing's Holy Grail: The Epic Quest for the Kentucky Derby&quot; - would lead one to believe that by reading this one will gain a deep insight into the workings of the Derby and what it takes to get there and win it. Not so. Haskin's thesis here can be summed up more or less as &quot;anything can happen.&quot; And while this isn't untrue, it certainly doesn't tell us anything we didn't already know. Avid racing fans that have been following the sport for years won't learn anything new here, and relative newcomers hoping to find a formula for picking winners won't find that either.<br />The information Haskin provides here is mostly in the form of statistics. He gives us lists and numbers. What he doesn't do is look in-depth at any of the past Derby contenders. We don't get to know any of them very well, or hear their stories. The book merely skims, and lacks depth.<br />Worse yet is the fact that Haskin doesn't seem to have a clear message for us. He says, &quot;There is a distinct formula for success that has proven its worth year after year&quot; (pg. 138) but he fails to make it clear what this formula is. Every time he tells us about a trend or &quot;rule&quot; relating to the Derby, he immediately follows it up with half a dozen not-uncommon exceptions. He even states that future Derby winners can look like anything, be bought for any price, be of any parentage, and have any kind of previous race record. While this is certainly a true statement, once again it's nothing profound or new.<br />Another problem is that Haskin meanders quite a bit and sometimes gets off-topic. He delves into topics like how to be a reporter, or how to spot a &quot;gonzo journalist,&quot; or how to tell what trainer comments really mean. None of this has much bearing on discovering the secret to a successful Derby. In fact, even much of the racing information Haskin gives is not specific to the Kentucky Derby, and it's often easy to forget that the book is supposed to be focussed on that one race.<br />My final irritation with the book is its use of space. The margins are large, the typeface is large, and the space between lines is enormous, leaving only 25 lines of text per page. And that's only on the pages that are composed entirely of text! About 75% of the pages are heavily picture-laden, which means that the actual length of the writing is much less than 219 pages. I normally don't mind having lots of photos in a book like this, but these aren't even very impressive photos. They're all black-and-white, and few are really appealing shots.<br />I realize that thus far I've only said negative things about the book, and perhaps that makes you wonder why I've even given it three stars. Despite my disappointment with it, it's not entirely bad. The information is accurate, at least, even if it doesn't tell us anything insightful. It is also easy to read, and can be finished quickly. What it boils down to, though, is the question of whether the book is worth it. Is it worth reading? Perhaps, though any long-time racing enthusiast will already know most of what Haskin says. Is it worth the price? I really don't think so. If you still do want to read it, check it out of the library.ven much of the racing information Haskin gives is not specific to the Kentucky Derby, and it's often easy to forget that the book is supposed to be focussed on that one race.<br />My final irritation with the book is its use of space.

US	46057280	R2G87YC9NV3PBX	015626224X	789289309	Down and Out in Paris and London	Books	5	68	70	N	N	Fascinating look at the &quot;down and out&quot; of the early 20th c.	This book reads much more like a memoir than the novel it is, and indeed it is a largely autobiographical work. Orwell begins with an anonymous narrator describing daily life in the poorer parts of Paris during the early 1900s. He describes the din, the dirt, the bugs, and all else in vivid detail. The narrator, an Englishman by birth, is living in Paris and running low on funds. We follow him through various attempts to earn money, including work as a lowly dishwasher or &quot;plongeur&quot; in the city's hotels, and also in one dubious restaurant. We learn all the dirty behind-the-scenes secrets of these operations, and it's quite enough to make one's skin crawl and cause one to avoid hotels and restaurants forever.<br />The second half of the book follows the narrator back to his native England, where he must find a way to get by in London while awaiting a permanent job. Here we are introduced to the tramp's way of life - vagrancy, begging, and sleeping in the cheapest (and filthiest) accomodations available. But we also get to know some of the narrator's fellow tramps, and to feel for them. They are not all the worthless, lazy scum that the higher classes of the time would paint them as. Orwell concludes the book with a brief treatise on the vagrant's plight and ways in which it can be eased, as well as making the tramp a usefull part of society.<br />Obviously Orwell's closing call-to-action is not entirely relevant anymore, as the workings of society have changed somewhat over the last century, but the book is nevertheless fascinating. A reader may at first be a little thrown off by the lack of a central plot, but once past this it is easy to get sucked into the world Orwell has illustrated here. His imagery is so striking that you actually feel as if you are sharing the narrator's experiences. You can feel the intense heat of the hotel kitchens, feel the weakness and weariness that comes with malnutrition, smell the grease and the sweat and the dirt.<br />And yet, as bleak as all this sounds, the book is not depressing. The narrator never lapses into dejection or self-pity, and the reader is left with a sense of hope throughout the novel. Being poor is not presented as a dead end - there are always ways to get by, some of them quite ingenious.

US	46057280	R1HV1ISBV55205	0553379011	668741763	The Story of B	Books	5	24	26	N	N	Better than &quot;Ishmael&quot;? You bet!	Thus far I have read three of Quinn's books - first &quot;Ishmael,&quot; which I've read twice, then &quot;My Ishmael,&quot; and now &quot;The Story of B,&quot; which I can definitely say is my favorite of the three. However, I would advise anyone new to Quinn to start with &quot;Ishmael,&quot; as it lays the foundation for his ideas. &quot;The Story of B&quot; takes the ideas from &quot;Ishmael&quot; further and looks at them in more depth. &quot;My Ishmael,&quot; is one that you can either read or not. While it isn't a bad book, it's pretty much just a new way of packaging everything Quinn had already said in &quot;Ishmael.&quot;<br />Those who are already familiar with Quinn will know that his basic message is that our culture (NOT to be confused with the entire human race) is slowly and blindly destroying itself. He describes our culture as a &quot;monster that is literally devouring the world - and will end by devouring itself if it isn't stopped&quot; (pg. 88). The story he uses to frame his arguments in this book is as follows: Father Jared Osborne is a Catholic priest sent to Europe by his superiors in order to investigate a man known to his followers as B. This mysterious B has been traveling throughout Germany, spreading ideas that have the Church concerned he may be the Antichrist. Osborne is instructed to break into B's group of followers and determine whether he is or isn't as dangerous as he seems.<br />I found it interesting that this book was written from the perspective of a Catholic priest, secure in his faith (initially, at least), whereas &quot;Ishmael&quot; was narrated by a disillusioned everyday citizen who already felt he had been &quot;lied to&quot; by &quot;Mother Culture.&quot; This has the effect of presenting a direct challenge to doubting readers, whereas &quot;Ishmael&quot; more or less preaches to the choir (i.e. those who already suspect that something isn't quite right with the way we're living). While I'm afraid &quot;The Story of B&quot; may still, to some degree, preach to the choir, I do believe it is more powerful and convincing than &quot;Ishmael&quot; was (though I loved &quot;Ishmael&quot; as well).<br />&quot;The Story of B&quot; also takes great steps in making itself palatable to a broader audience. It combines &quot;Ishmael&quot;-style dialogue-learning with a series of lectures. These lectures are presented in a separate section at the end of the book, but should be read as the story progresses, whenever the reader is signalled to do so. The protagonist in &quot;The Story of B&quot; may also be more sympathetic for readers than the protagonist of &quot;Ishmael.&quot; Osborne, unlike the narrator of &quot;Ishmael,&quot; is clearly an educated and intellectual man. Many readers of &quot;Ishmael&quot; were turned off by the narrator's apparent dimness (though this was just a device Quinn used in his attempt to make his ideas more accessible). While Osborne still has his dim moments, &quot;The Story of B&quot; does put more responsiblity on the reader to analyze what they're reading and draw their own conclusions.<br />One thing I particularly like about Quinn's style of writing here is that he presents his ideas in &quot;meal-sized&quot; chunks. Each chapter is broken up into smaller sub-chapters, providing plenty of good stopping places if the reader needs time to sit back and absorb something they've just read. And even if you do read the whole thing in a few long sittings, the story is structured in such a way that you'll get the necessary &quot;thinking breaks&quot; anyway. Whenever Quinn thinks his readers need a break from the heavy idea-driven stuff, he gives the protagonist himself some time off in a more plot-driven series of events.<br />What really made &quot;The Story of B&quot; stand out for me, however, is that it calls the reader to action, whereas &quot;Ishmael&quot; merely got the reader thinking. This book starts off much as &quot;Ishmael&quot; did, with the protagonist simply taking in ideas and not generating many of his own, but halfway through it takes a drastic and somewhat shocking change of direction. I wasn't sure if I liked this at first, but as I read on it became very clear what Quinn was doing, and I think he's quite successful. Anyone who found themselves stimulated by the ideas in &quot;Ishmael&quot; will no doubt find even more material of interest in &quot;The Story of B.&quot;nist simply taking in ideas and not generating many of his own, but halfway through it takes a drastic and somewhat shocking change of direction.

This is an excellent text for use in introductory world literature courses at either the high school or college levels. It offers a wide array of short stories, drama, and poetry by respected authors throughout history and up into the 20th century. Included are ancient pieces such as Akhenaton's &quot;Hymn to the Aton&quot; and Psalm 23 from the Bible, works by modern authors like Alice Walker, and everything in between, including Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Kafka, Dante, Dostoyesvsky, Yeats, Brontë, Wordsworth, Sophocles, Schiller, Ibsen, Colette, Bombal, Hemingway, Poe, Dickinson, and many more. There are 76 pieces in all, categorized by continent / region: the Mediterranean, Continental Europe, Africa, the Far East, Latin America, North America, and Great Britain.<br />Each piece, usually one of that particular author's best and most famous, is introduced by the editor with information on the author's life, times, and works. There are also accompanying critical questions for each story, play, and poem. I found that these were very useful as jumping-off points for the analysis of a piece, helping to start the critical thinking process. In addition, the editor suggests a few creative writing exercises to go along with each piece. I enjoyed using this book and feel that I gained a lot from it. The pieces are well-selected and give a nice sampling of literature from all geographical regions and time periods, including works in all genres and literary styles. Definitely a recommended text.	2004-06-03

(&quot;after Ford&quot;), and babies are no longer born. No one has a mother or father. In fact, those terms are now considered &quot;dirty&quot; words and are no longer used. Instead, everyone begins life as a test-tube baby, genetically and environmentally conditioned to fit into their own predestined social caste - Alpha (the highest caste, composed of society's most intelligent members), Beta, Delta, Gamma, or Epsilon (the lowest caste, composed of mindless semi-moron clone laborers). Godlike status has been conferred upon Henry Ford, and mass production is taken to frightening extremes. The world is considered stable, and everyone is happy. Working hours are light (and people are pre-conditioned to enjoy their work anyway), entertainment options abound, and promiscuity is encouraged. Taking the place of church services are weekly orgies. Happiness is the ultimate goal of existence, and if anyone should ever feel the slightest hint of depression, they are conditioned to turn immediately to the hallucinogenic drug called &quot;soma&quot; for immediate relief.<br />However, among the ranks of the intellectual Alphas, there remain a few who question the desirability of this synthetic world. One such man is Bernard Marx (interestingly, most of the names in this novel are adapted from those of historical political figures and theorists - Lenina Crowne, Polly Trotsky, Benito Hoover, Sarojini Engels, Herbert Bakunin, Helmoltz Watson, etc.). A few places in the world that are not considered worth modernizing are set aside as &quot;savage reservations&quot; which are now the only places where people still live in a &quot;pre-Fordian&quot; way. Marx takes a vacation to one of these reservations, and ends up bringing a savage back home with him. This, of course, sets the stage for all sorts of challenges to the society's values.<br />Perhaps I was expecting too much, based on all I'd previously heard about the book, or perhaps I would have been more struck by it if I hadn't already read &quot;1984&quot; by George Orwell, but Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; came as a bit of a disappointment to me. It's definitely worth reading once, especially for fans of dystopian literature, but unlike &quot;1984&quot; it's not one I'm likely to return to for a second helping anytime soon. The ideas Huxley puts forth are valuable, but the delivery leaves room for improvement. The story just doesn't hang together quite tightly enough to pack a full-blown punch.<br />The first couple of chapters are very interesting and seem promising, but after that it felt like the story deteriorated somewhat. As I said before, I do admire the points Huxley makes, but the book was not very compelling as a whole. Much of it takes the form of satire, which is fine, and even amusing, but then there are numerous points at which the plot goes far overboard and borders on the ridiculous. When this happens, the story ceases to be believable, compromising the strength of Huxley's messages. One of the things that makes Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; so terrifying and thought-provoking is that, though it is futuristic fiction, it is so detailed and serious that is actually seems plausible. Books like this need to be both plausible and scary for them to have an impact. If the reader doesn't get the feeling that such a world just might actually come into being, and that it is not a place they want to live, then it's hard to take the message seriously.<br />My overall verdict, therefore, is that you should read &quot;Brave New World&quot; once, but, unless you're a real dystopia buff, I'd recommend checking it out of the library or borrowing a copy from someone else rather than purchasing it. It's a valuable piece for the ideas is proposes, and it's a quick and easy read, but it is not the most effective book of its type. The fact that it was written so long ago (1932) also means that it does not take into account any historical events that have happened since then, and perhaps this is another reason why it seems a little less realistic. I do not regret reading it, as having done so adds to one's literary and philosophical repertoire, but I much more highly recommend George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; (written in 1948), which is both thoroughly engaging and highly thought-provoking.ned since then, and perhaps this is another reason why it seems a little less realistic.

If you're from &quot;Outside,&quot; perhaps you've never heard of &quot;breakup&quot; or &quot;termination dust.&quot; Whether you're an Alaska resident, a first-time or returning visitor, or simply someone who dreams of visiting the Last Frontier someday, this great book from the editors of the MILEPOST is choc full of great information.<br />The book is formatted somewhat like a light encyclopedia, with topics in alphabetical order. Most of the entries are short and to-the-point; the longest are only slightly over one page. It's interesting to read cover-to-cover, or you can just look things up as you need to. Residents of the state will already know some of the material, but there are also plenty of lesser-known facts included. I lived in Alaska for thirteen years and still learned several new things. My only criticism is that I wish they'd included a few more topics. For instance, there is no information on the Alaska Zoo, the Kuskokwim 300 Sled Dog Race, or Joe Redington, Sr., to name a few.<br />For the information &quot;Alaska A to Z&quot; does contain, however, I still highly recommend it. Published in 1997, it's a little bit old, so things like population figures are not quite current, but most of the entries are still applicable. The text is also interespersed with a selection of black-and-white photographs from the MILEPOST archives and quotes about Alaska from the famous and the not-so-famous. At the back of the book are two pages of contact information for various resources you might want to turn to for additional information. This is an excellent little reference for anyone with an interest in Alaska, resident or not.	2004-05-29

The term \\"Machiavellian\\" is frequently used to describe ruthlessness and brutality in a leader, and most people who have read about Machiavelli but have not actually read Machiavelli's own works assume that he believed \\"the ends justify the means.\\" However, this is a common misperception. His actual words are: \\"[. . .] in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, where there is no court of appeal, one looks at the outcome\\" (pg. 77). He does not, here or anywhere else in his writing, attempt to provide any moral justification for ruthlessness, but merely says that a leader will always be judged by his people based on the end result of his actions. He was very pragmatic in his outlook on princely rule, and sought to explain the actions that would and would not be effective in gaining and maintaining the rule of a nation.<br />Another point of some confusion is the saying that \\"it is better to be feared than to be loved.\\" Again, this is not quite what Machiavelli meant. His actual words are: \\"[. . .] there arises a dispute: whether it is better to be loved than feared, or the contrary. The reply is that one should like to be both the one and the other, but as it is difficult to bring them together, it is much safer to be feared than to be loved if one of the two has to be lacking\\" (pg. 72). It is also noteworthy to point out that the word \\"fear\\" at the time Machiavelli was alive was less synonymous with its modern meaning than it was with the word \\"respect.\\" He was saying that a prince's throne is more secure if he is feared/respected but not loved than it is if he is loved but not feared/respected. Machiavelli does not say that a prince who is feared is the moral better of one who is loved.<br />\\"The Prince\\" is a truly fascinating work of philosophy, describing the ideal conduct (in mechanical and not moral terms) of an effective sovereign. Despite the fact that it is entirely concerned with the government of principalities, Machiavelli himself was a republican, and believed that the most effective form of government would combine elements of a principality, an aristocracy, and a democracy. His motivation to write \\"The Prince\\" came from his desire to ingratiate himself with the Medici family, the ruling power in Florence at the time, and also from his belief that only a single, strong ruler would be powerful enough to unify and liberate a then-factionalized Italy.<br />The book is not an easy read, but is more accessible than, say, Rousseau's \\"Social Conract\\" (I'm not equating the topics of these two books, but just comparing literary style). Machiavelli tends to use very long, complex sentences, and it's easy to get derailed before reaching the end of one. Some of his sentences easily take up a third of a page. This particular translation has made things a little simpler, and in the introduction the translator admits to breaking up some of Machiavelli's longer sentences into multiple shorter ones. The translator also includes helpful notes to supplement the text, which aid the reader's understanding. I do wish, though, that he'd placed these as footnotes rather than at the end of each chapter, since they are quite copious and having to flip back and forth after every few sentences can be distracting. Nevertheless, the content of \\"The Prince\\" is definitely worth the time and concentration it takes to read.<br />Readers who do not already have a detailed knowledge of pre-16th century Italian and ancient Roman history will no doubt have additional difficulties understanding Machiavelli's work. Being Italian, he used examples primarily from Italy's political history and from his studies of Rome. The translator's notes do help somewhat, but do not provide a full background. Machiavelli also, at times, misrepresents history either inadvertantly, or purposefully so as to better back up his arguments. He also has a tendency to over-simplify things, and does not take into account that real life is rarely as clear-cut as he presents it.<br />One thing I like about this edition of \\"The Prince\\" (2003 Barnes & Noble printing w/ translation by Wayne A. Rebhorn) is that it includes some of Machiavelli's other writings. \\"The Life of Castruccio Castracani of Lucca\\" is interesting for a couple of reasons. It was intended to show an example of someone who had the proper princely qualities (by Machiavelli's standards). However, to make Castracani fit more completely his conception of the ideal prince, Machiavelli fabricated many aspects of his life. This piece serves more as an insight into Machiavelli's character than as a biography of Castracani. The other writings included are a letter Machiavelli sent to his friend Francesco Vettori, concerning \\"The Prince,\\" and several excerpts from his \\"Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy,\\" which were written at the same time as, and are supplementary to, \\"The Prince.\\" At the end there is a selection of comments, contemporary and modern, from others regarding Machiavelli's writing, as well as four critical-thinking questions to help a reader better analyze the text.<br />While many things have changed since Machiavelli wrote \\"The Prince\\" in c.1513, much of what he says is still relevant to some degree. The basic concepts he presents can be adapted for application in just about any position of leadership. However, it must always be remembered that this book was only meant as a technical guide, and does not attempt to justify itself on moral grounds. \\"The Prince\\" is also a worthwhile read for the reason that it will give the reader a better, more complete understanding of the term \\"Machiavellian,\\" and the ability to recognize when it is or isn't being used correctly, as well as the ability to use it correctly themself.

US	46057280	RFMNLE26LA77Q	0375408983	679367486	Elizabeth and Mary: Cousins, Rivals, Queens	Books	4	91	96	N	N	A fascinating side-by-side comparison of two rival queens.	Many have criticized this dual biography for not introducing new material, and simply re-hashing what has been written elsewhere. And clearly there is no shortage of excellent biogaphies on both of these queens. However, it is the format of Dunn's book that sets it apart and gives us an innovative perspective. Queen Elizabeth I of England and Mary, Queen of Scots, were both fascinating monarchs in their own right, but equally fascinating is the complex relationship between them. Both women had a claim to the throne of England. Elizabeth was the daughter of King Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth's grandfather, Henry VII, who overthrew Richard III and founded the Tudor dynasty, was also the great-grandfather of Mary (born to King James V of Scotland and Mary of Guise). Elizabeth was Mary's elder by only nine years. Both women were ambitious, passionate, and cunning. Yet despite their similar status as queens and cousins, these two women were also very different from one another.<br />Mary became Queen of Scotland only six days after her birth in 1542, upon the death of her father. In 1548 she was sent to France, to grow up in the court of her French fiance, the dauphin Francis. Her status was never in question, and therefore she never questioned it herself. Elizabeth, however, traversed a much more tumultuous path to her throne. When her mother was beheaded so Henry VIII could marry his third wife, the young princess was declared illegitimate and removed from the succession. Ultimately her place in the succession was reinstated, but this in no way guaranteed that she would ever become queen. First in line was her radically Protestant half-brother, Edward, who died young. Next came the devoutly Catholic Mary I (&quot;Bloody Mary&quot;), Elizabeth's half-sister from Henry VIII's first marriage, under whom Elizabeth even spent some time in the Tower of London. It was only upon Mary's death in 1558, when Elizabeth was 24 years of age, that she finally ascended the throne herself.<br />The relationship between Elizabeth and Mary was very multi-faceted (despite the fact that the two queens never met). For most of her life, Mary referred to Elizabeth as a dear sister, and actively sought her cousin's favor. Yet at the same time Mary coveted the English crown, and even on several occasions declared that she herself was the rightful Queen of England. Yet the Queen of Scots, by dint of her as-yet unthreatened sovereignty, could also be presumtuous to a fault. Her impulsive marriage to Lord Darnley, her second husband (who was shortly thereafter murdered), against the will and advice of many in both Scotland and England, marked the beginning of her ultimate downward slide. Elizabeth, while she displayed more pragmatism in matters of the heart, was also somewhat jealous of her cousin's romantic exploits. Elizabeth had realized early on that she could never marry her personal favorite, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, and that she must instead declare herself to be married to her country, but this did not erase her longing for romantic fulfilment.<br />Ultimately Elizabeth was forced to imprison, and eventually execute, her cousin and rival queen. Mary, fleeing from Scottish rebels, thought to run to Elizabeth for refuge and support. But Elizabeth insisted on an investigation into Mary's possible involvement in the murder of Lord Darnley, and therefore detained the Scottish queen in a remote castle. Despite Mary's repeated pleas, she refused an audience with her, fearing the Queen of Scots' reputation for beguiling charm. Mary's imprisonment became all the more serious when she was implicated in a plot to assassinate Elizabeth. The English queen had no desire to execute her cousin, despite pressure from her counselors. Only when irrefutable proof of Mary's involvement was produced did Elizabeth finally sign the death warrant, and even then she was plagued with guilt. In all, Mary spent nearly two decades as Elizabeth's prisoner, and was finally beheaded in 1587, still having never met her cousin and greatest rival.<br />The basic story is obviously the same. Indeed, I think it would be hard to introduce any new material on the lives of Elizabeth and Mary at this point, when we probably already know all we ever will about them. Yet Dunn's presentation here is fascinating. By placing the two queens side-by-side for comparison and contrast, and focussing on their relationship, we get to see both sides of the story simultaneously. This format emphasizes the inter-connectedness of their lives, and really shows how much each was dependent on the other. In many ways each served as the only person who could truly identify with the other, both being women rulers in a time when females were seen as incapable of effective leadership, and being each other's closest blood relatives (with the exception of Mary's son, James VI &amp; I).<br />Dunn's writing style, while not the most engaging I have ever read, is nevertheless very accessible. She has clearly done her research, and paints a lovely dual portrait of these two women. I also liked the fact that, when using direct quotes, Dunn gives both the original text with its archaic and unstandardized spellings, and also the same quote written with modern spellings, which makes it easier to read and understand. My only real criticism of the text is that she skims over a few events that are considered &quot;well-known,&quot; when the book would have been more balanced and informative if Dunn had written on all events with equal detail. After all, not all her readers will have read extensively on these monarchs before picking up this book. On a positive note, the book is equipped with numerous full-color pictures, including portraits of the queens, their family members, important members of their courts, and even some pictures of embroidery Mary completed while imprisoned in England.

US	46057280	R3FT54EUPYP8OW	158663609X	14495261	Irish Fairy and Folk Tales	Books	5	28	30	N	N	A fascinating look at the tradition of folklore in Ireland.	In this delightful volume, first published in 1892, William Butler Yeats has collected all manner of Irish folklore (mostly short stories, with a few poems) from a wide variety sources. He has divided the works into categories as follows: the &quot;Trooping Fairies&quot; (fairies, changelings, and the &quot;merrow&quot; or mermaids); the &quot;Solitary Fairies&quot; (the lepracaun, the pooka - an animal spirit, and the banshee); &quot;Ghosts&quot;; &quot;Witches &amp; Fairy Doctors&quot;; &quot;T'yeer-na-n-Oge&quot; or &quot;Tir-na-n-Og&quot; (a legendary island said to appear and disappear); &quot;Saints &amp; Priests&quot;; &quot;The Devil&quot;; &quot;Giants&quot;; and &quot;Kings / Queens / Princesses / Earls / Robbers.&quot; Yeats introduces each section with background information on the creature the stories in that category will concern. He also includes numerous footnotes of interest, making this book a valuable resource for anyone seeking to learn about the tradition of Irish folklore.<br />While I have given this anthology a five-star rating based on it's value as a source of information on Irish mythology, it would probably be worth only four stars for entertainment value alone. Some of the stories are very short and/or don't have much of a point, and are less interesting. These tend to serve more as testimony to the nature of a particular mythical being rather than being an actual story with a plot and message for the reader. Nevertheless, the book as a whole offers a very comprehensive look at just what defines Irish folk culture. The stories that do have a point sometimes take the form of &quot;how things came to be this way&quot; tales, or provide a moral lesson, etc. Many of the stories are rather dark, as that tends to be the nature of lore from this region, but there are also some lighthearted and cheerful pieces.<br />Despite the book having been compiled more than one hundred years ago, most of the stories are quite easy to read. Yeats makes things even more simple for the reader by making footnotes where old Irish words or phrases are used, giving us their meaning. However, there are a few stories that have been left in a more archaic form, which is distracting and a bit harder to decipher. Take, for example, the following excerpt:<br />&quot;. . . the minit he puts his knife into the fish, there was a murtherin' screech, that you'd the life id lave you if you hurd it, and away jumps the throut out av the fryin'-pan into the middle o' the flure; and an the spot where it fell, up riz a lovely lady - the beautifullest crathur that eyes ever seen, dressed in white, and a band o' goold in her hair, and a sthrame o' blood runnin' down her arm&quot; (pg. 46).<br />I should probably make note of the fact, for those whom it might interest, that although the title page says the book is &quot;profusely illustrated,&quot; there are actually only a few pictures. I believe only six of the over seventy stories are illustrated, and these with simple (but nice), old-fashioned line drawings in black and white. However this is not really a criticism as I view it, since I like the book for its literary content and wouldn't really care if it had no pictures at all.<br />One of the things I enjoy most about literature is finding connections with other works I've read, and &quot;Irish Fairy &amp; Folk Tales&quot; does not disappoint in this regard. Many of the pieces are derivations of other, more common fairy tales. For instance, &quot;Smallhead and the King's Sons&quot; (Ghosts / pg. 194) incorporates some elements from both &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Hansel and Gretel,&quot; while &quot;The Giant's Stairs&quot; (Giants / pg. 355) has some similarities to the story of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk.&quot; There are more connections like this. On the whole I found this book to be very enjoyable, and also a valuable read from a literary / academic standpoint. I'd certainly recommend it to anyone interesting in the history of Irish culture, the study of fairy tales and folklore, or both.f Irish culture, the study of fairy tales and folklore, or both.	2004-05-20

This a very nice anthology of mostly lesser-known horse stories. We've all read about Misty of Chincoteague and Black Beauty and the Black Stallion, so it's nice to see some fresher material. Editor Roger Caras has compiled a collection of twenty-seven tales in every imaginable genre. There are westerns, racing stories, historical fiction, science fiction, mysteries, comedies, satires, a couple spooky stories, and even a few tragedies. Caras has chosen to include mostly stories that are relatively recent. There are a few famous ones, like Rudyard Kipling's \\"The Maltese Cat\\" and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes mystery, \\"Silver Blaze.\\" There are also stories by Mark Twain and Richard Harding Davis, but the majority of the authors are less widely known. Some I had never even heard of. The stories also vary widely in length, some being only a few pages, and the longest spanning over fifty.<br />The stories included are as follows:<br />Mark Twain: \\"A Horse's Tale\\"<br />Larry Niven: \\"The Flight of the Horse\\"<br />Richard Harding Davis: \\"Mr. Travers's First Hunt\\"<br />Hugh Johnson: \\"Levant\\"<br />George Pattullo: \\"The Man-Killer\\"<br />Cloudesley Johns: \\"Skyrocket and the Blue Stuff\\"<br />Rudyard Kipling: \\"The Maltese Cat\\"<br />Charles A. Stephens: \\"Treading Down the Herd's Grass\\"<br />Shelly Rider Meyer: \\"A Mistake In Identity\\"<br />Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: \\"Silver Blaze\\"<br />Mary Wilkins Freeman: \\"The Doctor's Horse\\"<br />J. Lincoln Steffens: \\"The Old Jim Horse\\"<br />Alvah Milton Kerr: \\"In Front of the Stampede\\"<br />Alfred Stoddard: \\"Over the Jumps\\"<br />H. C. Bunner: \\"The Cumbersome Horse\\"<br />Ellis Parker Butler: \\"Pete, the Circassian Horse\\"<br />F. R. Weir: \\"The Tale of a Cayuse\\"<br />Sewell Ford: \\"Skipper\\"<br />A. W. Rolker: \\"The Black Roan of 265\\"<br />Richard Harding Davis: \\"The Man Who Could Not Lose\\"<br />Zane Grey: \\"The Horses of Bostil's Ford\\"<br />Erle Stanley Gardner: \\"Carved in Sand<br />Deborah Moulton: \\"The Winged Foal\\"<br />James Powell: \\"The Kidnap of Bounding Mane\\"<br />William F. Nolan: \\"Shadow Quest\\"<br />Clay Fisher: \\"The Trap\\"<br />Max Brand: \\"Miniature\\"<br />The first story is probably the most tragic and depressing in the book, so upon finishing it I was a bit apprehensive of what the rest would be like, but most of the stories are thoroughly enjoyable. A couple of the pieces are only loosely horse-related, but they're still good tales and I was not sorry to see them included. My personal favorites from this book are Niven's \\"The Flight of the Horse,\\" a science fiction tale that takes a delightfully humorous turn; Weir's \\"The Tale of a Cayuse,\\" a touching story in which a horse brings an unlikely couple together; and Brand's \\"Miniature,\\" where a man faces a choice between a life of luxury, or the horse he loves. There are a few duds (\\"The Kidnap of Bounding Mane\\" is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read, and \\"The Winged Foal\\" seems as if someone chopped the first chapter out of a disturbing sci-fi / fantasy novel and left out the rest of the story), but on the whole it's a great book. The stories are all well-written and easy to read, and I'd definitely recommend this collection to any horse lover.hadow Quest\\"<BR>Clay Fisher: \\"The Trap\\"<BR>Max Brand: \\"Miniature\\"<br />The first story is probably the most tragic and depressing in the book, so upon finishing it I was a bit apprehensive of what the rest would be like, but most of the stories are thoroughly enjoyable.

US	46057280	R2HZMVYYNAL2RB	0801011981	885843242	Song of Creation	Books	4	10	12	N	N	A decent book, but not as good as &quot;Wildlife&quot;	If you're a steadfast fan of Carl Brenders, and already own his previous book &quot;Wildlife,&quot; there would be little use in purchasing this book. All but a handful of the paintings that appear in &quot;Songs of Creation&quot; are also found in &quot;Wildlife,&quot; where they are printed, for the most part, in a larger size. In &quot;Songs of Creation&quot; the prints are smaller, and some cross the centerfold of the book, making it difficult to see the entire work. Nevertheless, it is still a beautiful book, and may be a decent substitute if you hesitate to purchase the more expensive &quot;Wildlife.&quot;<br />Carl Brenders is an extremely talented artist, and produces some of the most gorgeous realistic animal paintings around. His work is easy to mistake for a photograph at first glance if you haven't seen one of his paintings before. This particular collection contains 36 of Brenders' paintings, depicting a variety of animals: bears, eagles, deer, wolves, foxes, big cats, and more. The layout is fairly nice, with pleasing background colors, though I still prefer the look of &quot;Wildlife.&quot; The only major drawback is, as I mentioned before, the fact that several paintings cross the centerfold.<br />As the title might suggest, each work is accompanied by a verse of poetry or an excerpt from the Bible. The text is all very Christian, but non-Christians could easily ignore it in favor of the artwork, if inclined to do so. In terms of poetry, it isn't that spectacular in the first place. To get to the bottom line, I'd recommend this only if you don't want to spend the money on &quot;Wildlife.&quot; It's not a bad collection in and of itself, but &quot;Wildlife&quot; is much better and contains nearly every painting seen here, minus the poetry.	2004-05-11

When a friend of mine told me about this book, I just knew I had to get it. Gollum was my favorite character back when I read Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and, seeing the movies, I was amazed at how well his complexity was captured in a CG (computer-generated) character. Yet, until I watched the bonus features on the extended version of the DVD for \\"The Two Towers,\\" I'd had no idea how much Andy Serkis had put into this role. I, like most people, assumed he'd merely done the voice. So I was thoroughly impressed upon seeing how hard Serkis has worked, and gained an immense respect for him. This book, written by Serkis himself, takes us even further into the creation of the most impressive CG character ever created to date.<br />Writing in chronological order, Serkis takes us through his entire experience with the making of the movie trilogy. When he was first offered what was initially described as a three-week job doing the voice for Gollum, he was unimpressed. He hadn't even read the books. But when Serkis's girlfriend (now wife) heard about the offer, her response was \\"Oh Andy, you've GOT to go for it!\\" (pg. 3). And thus the journey began. After doing a little background reading, he began to prepare for his audition, but was at a loss for what Gollum's voice should sound like. In a strange twist of fate, his hairball-afflicted cat, Diz, provided the answer. But Serkis found that he could only do the voice properly if he actually crouched down and physically acted out his role as Gollum. Unknown to him at the time, what started out as a techinique to help the actor get into character would ultimately redefine the entire role.<br />It is usually assumed by newcomers to the movies that Serkis only provided Gollum's voice, and that the rest was entirely CG-driven. What one sees in the movie IS entirely computer-generated, but Gollum's movement throughout the films is copied almost entirely from Serkis's own physical acting. Even his facial expressions were used. \\"In fact,\\" Serkis says, \\"more actor hours were spent working on Gollum than on any conventional screen character\\" (pg. 110). He actually had to perform each of Gollum's scenes twice - once with Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Sean Astin (Sam) to provide them with something other than thin air to act against, and again on his own, wearing a special motion-capture suit (often with numerous takes and retakes for each version). The data collected from the motion-capture takes was then given to animators from Weta Digital as a basis for Gollum's movement.<br />In addition to all his \\"hidden\\" work, Serkis does have some actual screen time - in the scene where young Smeagol murders his cousin Deagol to get the Ring. This scene, not in the original script, also meant that the CG Gollum's face had to be drastically redesigned. Gollum had to look like something that could reasonably have evolved from Smeagol, and in this case Smeagol looked like Andy Serkis. Thus the original conception of Gollum (which can be seen briefly in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\") was greatly altered, given more Andy-like features.<br />Not only does Serkis reflect on what went into the actual creation of Gollum, but he also shares with us the overall picture of his life during the years he spent working on \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" His son, Sonny, was born during the film's production. In 2002 Serkis married long-time girlfriend and mother to his two children, Lorraine Ashbourne. He also takes us along on his numerous New Zealand side trips, hiking, camping, and even river-kayaking. He tells us about the birthdays that were celebrated during this time - both his own and those of his daughter, Ruby. In one place he has included a poem he wrote to Ruby during a period when he was separated from his family. Serkis (himself originally from the Middle-East) even reflects on his reactions to the events of 11 Sept. 2001 and the subsequent \\"war on terrorism.\\"<br />The book also contains numerous other goodies. Thereare over one hundred full-color images, including concept art, production photos, and movie stills. We can also read inset comments (ranging in length from one paragraph to a couple of pages) from others involved in Gollum's creation, among them director Peter Jackson, co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, and various Weta Digital artists. One fun little feature is the \\"flip-book\\" like images of Gollum: on the top, outer corner of each page is a small picture of Gollum's face with a different expression; if you flip rapidly through all the pages, you can see a kind of little \\"mini-movie\\" of him. My ONLY criticism of the book is that I wish the pictures had captions. In cases where Serkis is talking about, say, several different pieces of concept art, and only one or two are pictured, it is not always apparent which is which.<br />This book is an absolute must-read for any Gollum fan. It's a fairly quick read (I finished it in a few hours), but provides an amazing wealth of information. Serkis's writing is very reader-friendly, and his frequent self-deprecating humor adds a wonderful comic quality to some of his experiences (he describes himself as \\"a man in a gimp suit, with a face that makes Jim Carrey's look relaxed\\" (pg. 26).). The whole work is a tremendous look into the leading edge of CGI technoglogy, and also offers some great insights into the story of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and the character of Gollum in particular. I just can't recommend it hightly enough. Definitely get a copy for yourself, and consider it as a gift for any Gollum-loving friend. In a word, it's precious.are over one hundred full-color images, including concept art, production photos, and movie stills.

First I must make a note of the fact that this is the first and only Sherlock Holmes story I've read thus far. Therefore I cannot offer any kind of comparison between &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; and Doyle's other works. I will simply give you my thoughts about it as a story in and of itself.<br />The book is simply written and easy to understand, but the plot remains engaging throughout. It is not overly complicated, but neither is it too simplistic or predictable. The Baskerville family has passed down the legend of a giant black hound that plagues the residents of Baskerville Hall, bringing a swift end to any that dare venture alone onto the nearby moor at night. When Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead upon the moor with the pawprints of a large dog in the earth nearby, the case is presented to Sherlock Holmes in hopes of unraveling the mystery and ensuring the safety of Sir Charles's nephew and Baskerville Hall's new occupant, Sir Henry Baskerville.<br />Too busy to investigate the matter himself, Holmes sends his friend and assistant, Dr. Watson, out to Baskerville Hall in his stead. Watson is the narrator of the story, and we see threads of the mystery slowly unravel as he makes his reports back to Holmes. Other reviewers have complained about the fact that Holmes is not the central figure in this particular novel, but I actually liked the way the story was done. And as we find out toward the end of the book, Holmes actually plays a larger part than he initially appears to. I must admit, though, that it was a bit depressing to see Watson toil away at investigating and drawing conclusions only to have Holmes repeatedly inform him that his conclusions are wrong. Watson does most of the drudge-work but gets very little in return.<br />The style of the writing was very appealing to me. The story has a very dark, gothic feel, and is full of suspense. Doyle's descriptions make the eerie moor feel very real. For a book written a century ago, it is still very reader-friendly. The only part where I thought the book dropped off a little was in the last few chapters. For all the build-up and suspense, the climax of the story is much too short and quickly resolved, leaving a feeling of unreality. Also, Doyle concludes by having Holmes simply recite to Watson all the details of his sleuthing that were left out of the action of the book. I think the rule &quot;Show, don't tell,&quot; is a good one when it comes to literature, and I would rather have actually seen Holmes come to his conclusions as the story progressed.<br />Overall, though, I did enjoy the book, and look forward to reading more of Doyle's work. My one last word of advice regards this particular edition of the book (the 1993 Signet Classics printing with Afterword by Frederick Busch). There are numerous typos that really should have been caught and corrected before publishing (most, curiously, are instances where the letter &quot;t&quot; is inexplicably replaced with the letter &quot;b&quot;). I would recommend looking for a different version that is more competently edited.ll very reader-friendly. The only part where I thought the book dropped off a little was in the last few chapters.

In 1985, Libby Riddles became the first woman to win the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a grueling 1,100+ mile test of stamina and spirit. When an unusually severe snowstorm stopped all the other mushers in their tracks, Riddles pushed on. It was only her second time running the Iditarod, but her courage and determination brought her into Nome, Alaska ahead of the pack. In this book she recalls her experiences, briefly recounting her childhood and early life, and then describing the famous race. The writing is simple and fast-paced, but still captures the feeling of her adventure. You can feel the cutting sharpness of the wind-driven snow or see the northern lights dancing overhead. The book is also beautifully illustrated with simple but vibrant colored pencil drawings by Shannon Cartwright. This is an excellent Iditarod story for any young reader and I'd definitely recommend it.	2004-05-02

The &quot;readers&quot; ask about everything from romance, to the raising of kittens, to dealing with humans, and even the meaning of life. Occasionally a human or even a dog will write in with a question. Tabby's witty replies are sure to make you smile. Some of the advice can even be applied to our own human lives. The questions and responses are best read in order, as sometimes (just as with real advice columns) a letter refers to a previous letter from another reader. This is a very fun little book that would make a great present for yourself or a cat-loving friend. Here's a small sampling of what you can expect:<br />&quot;Dear Tabby,<br />The humans I live with refuse to keep my litter boxes clean. Every time I try to use them, they're a mess. They certainly don't expect ME to clean them, do they?<br />- Exasperated in Exeter&quot;<br />&quot;Dear Exasperated,<br />You could try scratching the words CLEAN ME in the litter - but you'd just wind up on CNN or in a circus. And you'd probably still have dirty litter boxes. Difficult as it is, just stop using them for a while. Find creative places around the house to use instead. (Underwear drawers often seem made for this very thing.) Your careless humans should get the hint VERY quickly.&quot; (pg. 54)<br />----------<br />&quot;Dear Tabby,<br />How many cats would it take, lined up tail to nose, to reach from here to the moon? I don't know why I keep thinking about this question, but I'm trying to get an idea of just how far away places like the moon really are. Thanks.<br />- Staggered by the Immensity of It All.&quot;<br />&quot;Dear Staggered,<br />Assuming a distance from the earth to the moon of approximately 235,000 miles, and assuming the average cat is roughly 26 inches in length from the tip of its nose to the end of its tail, it would take nearly 572,692,000 cats laid end to end to reach the moon. It would, of course, take about 300 million more of them if they were all Manxes.&quot; (pg. 30).

Philippa Gregory's &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; is an utterly fascinating and masterfully written story. While there are a few places where Gregory has taken more artistic liberty with history than I would have liked, the overall effect of the book as a story in itself is terrific. Most people will have heard of Anne Boleyn, the ill-fated second wife of England's King Henry VIII and mother of Queen Elizabeth I. Little attention, however, is paid to Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister. Mary was one of Henry's many mistresses and had two children by him, but few texts say much else about her. She is, in every sense, the &quot;other Boleyn girl&quot; of the title. Therefore, Gregory's choice of Mary as the narrator for this story lends it a fresh and intriguing perspective on life in the Tudor court and her sister's well-known rise and fall.<br />The book opens in 1521, with a young and naive 13-year-old Mary watching the execution of her uncle, the Duke of Buckinghamshire. It then skips ahead to the following year, when Anne returns from France and enters service alongside her sister as a lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine of Aragon. Though historians are not entirely certain which Boleyn girl was the eldest, the author has chosen, for this story, to place Anne's birth one year ahead of Mary's. As it becomes apparent that the Queen is unlikely to provide the King with a male heir, and also that Henry has taken a fancy to the nubile Mary, the Boleyn family is quick to push this youngest Boleyn girl into the King's bed. Their hope is that she will bear him a son and that Henry might eventually marry her. They would then be blood relations to the future King of England, making them the most powerful family in the country.<br />Mary quickly provides Henry with two children - first a daughter and then a son. After the second child is born, however, the King's attraction to Mary begins to wane. It is then that Anne decides to play for the King's favor herself. The two sisters find themselves to be both fierce rivals and each other's only allies at the same time. Eventually Mary steps aside as Anne aspires to the greatest prize of all, the Queenship of England. From here on we see the Boleyn girls take very different courses in life. Anne must do everything she can to hold Henry's attention and maintain her position. Mary, meanwhile, wants nothing more than to leave the duplicitious world of the court behind and settle into a peaceful life in the country. But she cannot be free while Anne needs her help. We watch Mary struggle with her opposing duties and desires right up until the end of the story in 1536.<br />While the story is excellent, I do have a few quibbles with Gregory's twists on history. The real Anne Boleyn was not so cold and heartless as she is portrayed to be in this novel. She was simply highly ambitious and lacking in propriety and discretion. Likewise, Mary was not as overwhelmingly innocent and virtuous as Gregory would have us believe. She, too, was ambitious, and schemed along with her family. I must admit, however, that for the sake of the story these adjustments by the author are beneficial. What disturbs me more is Gregory's implication that Anne had an affair with her brother, George Rochford. This was, of course, one of the accusations that led to her execution, but most modern historians agree that it is highly unlikely that it actually happened. An excellent book for more information on Anne Boleyn is Alison Weir's &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; - I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about any of Henry's wives.<br />Despite the fact that Gregory made some alterations to Mary's and Anne's dispositions, she nevertheless did a spot-on job with most of the other key players in the book. Her portrayal of King Henry VIII in particular was excellent. Based on all I have read about him (and I've read quite a bit), she has captured his personality perfectly. We see his transformation overtime from the robust, fit, flirtatious youth to the obese and moody tyrant of his elder days. In fact, Gregory seems to have a gift for showing changes in a character's personality over time. She has done the same thing with Mary. At the beginning of the book she is young and almost irritatingly naive, but by the end she has grown into a strong, intelligent, and well-rounded woman. It is fascinating to watch these changes unfold.<br />This is the first of Philippa Gregory's novels that I have read, but I'll definitely be reading more in the future. She is a gifted writer and I like her style. There is enough of a factual basis to keep the story plausible, but she adds her own interpretations that lend much intrique and excitement. Though the book takes place in the 16th century, Gregory has modernized the dialogue to a point where it still sounds authentic but is much easier to read. This is definitely a worthwhile book for any historical fiction buff, and while it's not a completely accurate history of the time, it is nevertheless a colorful look at the Tudor court and a fascinating story.

His mind, however, remained intact. A victim of &quot;locked-in syndrome,&quot; the only part of his body that he could still move was his left eyelid. Unable to communicate in any other way, he and his therapists devised a system whereby Bauby could blink out what he wanted to say, letter by letter. In this way, he managed to compose his memoir, with his speech therapist carefully transcribing Bauby's coded blinks. The book was published just two days before Bauby's death in 1996.<br />I became aware of this book when I learned that Johnny Depp will star in a movie of &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; in 2006 (playing Bauby himself). Intrigued, I decided to read up beforehand. What I discovered was a poignant and inspirational expression of a man with an incredibly strong spirit. Though he expresses frustration and sadness at his condition, Bauby does not wallow in the trap of self-pity. His observations of the world are sharpened and given new perspective as he is forced to deal with paralysis. Bauby is even able to look at elements of his predicament with a wry sense of humor, as in the time a nurse woke him up to ask if he wanted a sleeping pill.<br />The book is not written as a linear story - in fact, we don't read about the day of Bauby's stroke until near the end - but rather it is a collection of vignettes. In some he offers insights and observations of his daily life in the hospital. In others he reflects on various memories, with both fondness and, at times, regret for missed opportunities. And in still other chapters he shares with us the dreams he has had since his stroke. He also reflects on his last day as a normally functioning person, and on some of the plans he had in his life before - plans that he never got to fulfill. Bauby has dedicated the book to his children, and it is clear that he misses being a regular father.<br />&quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; is a very easy read, and well worth the time. It is only 132 pages in length, but I can't help imagining just how tedious it must have been for Bauby to blink out even one page, let alone over one hundred. That, and the amazingly beautiful, fluent language in which the book is written has given me an overwhelming respect for this remarkable man. We have here a window into a soul that refused to die, even while trapped within a body that could no longer move. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone, as it sparks in the reader a more complete awareness of the world and a fuller appreciation for the little things in life.and it is clear that he misses being a regular father.<br />&quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; is a very easy read, and well worth the time.

US	46057280	R2MGA8VBTDFKGW	0395547938	982245094	Moss Gown	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Cinderella meets King Lear - a delightful fairy tale!	This is a beautiful children's storybook that combines the age-old Cinderella fairy tale with the play \\"King Lear\\" (giving Shakespeare's tragedy a happy ending), and sets it in the colonial South. The tale is one that evolved among American colonists and has been passed down through the generations in various forms. Author William H. Hooks has set it down here in a delightful format.<br /><br />An old man, trying to decide how he should split his property among his three daughters, asks them each how much they love him. The two eldest flatter him with false protestations of love, while the youngest says simply: \\"I love you more than meat loves salt\\" (pg. 11). Thinking that his youngest loves him no more than common salt, the father splits his lands between the other two, who promtply turn her out of the house. While fleeing through the woods, the girl meets a green-eyed black woman who gives her a magical dress made of leaves and moss, which turns into a beautiful gown at night. Moss Gown, as she decides to call herself, then finds work as a kitchen maid in the home of a young gentleman. She is ridiculed by the other help for her shabby dress, but when the gentleman throws a special ball, Moss Gown shows up in the beautiful dress and dazzles them all. No one recognizes her, and she slips away as the night ends and the dress turns back to moss. The gentleman, who has fallen quite in love with the mysterious girl, pines for her and is absolutely determined to track her down.<br /><br />Though I suspect you can guess the outcome, I'll leave you to discover it yourself. This book would be great to read aloud to children, but is also written simply enough for them to read for themselves. Each page is attractively illustrated as well, and at the end the author has included a note on the origins of the story. I have enjoyed this book since I was a child, and would highly recommend it.	2004-04-25

This is a very traditional telling of the Sleeping Beauty story, based on the fairy tale originally written down by the Brothers Grimm. There is no real innovation where the plot is concerned. What makes the book special is its beautiful illustrations. Trina Schart Hyman is a talented artist, and her drawings are a treat to look at. Each page is very nicely laid out, with the text set within the pictures (as opposed to having the text on blank pages and the pictures opposite, as is common). My only reservation is that some of the illustrations are quite dark and oppressive, and may bother very young children. The one that is most disturbing is the picture showing the dead and decaying bodies of Princess Briar Rose's many failed suitors caught in the thorny brambles around the castle. So I'd advise caution with the extremely young, but the book would be great for slightly older children. It is suitable either to be read aloud, or for the kids to read themselves. All in all, a beautiful telling of this classic story.	2004-04-25

Having read and immensely enjoyed two of Rutherfurd's previous books - 'Sarum' and 'The Forest' - I was really looking forward to this book. It was slightly disappointing in comparison with the author's other work, but not too much so. Those who've read Rutherfurd before will know that he writes in a style very much like that of the late James Michener (though I find him much more readable than Michener). His books focus on one particular area and trace the lines of several fictional families down through time. This particular novel, the first of a two-book work, is centered around Dublin, Ireland.<br /><br />There are five basic sub-stories which serve as 'windows' into history. The first begins in AD 430 and tells the love story of an Irish prince and the woman whom he wishes to marry. The king himself wants the girl for his bride, so the prince and his girl are forced to flee and live in hiding. Rutherfurd weaves many real historical events into the writing, which gives the story a great richness. Toward the end of this first section we witness the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, the coming of St. Patrick, and the effect of the new faith upon those who uphold the old druidic traditions.<br /><br />The second story brings us forward more than five centuries to AD 981, and focuses on the events sparked by the coming of the Vikings to Ireland. The main characters here are direct descendants of those in the first story, and we see some things passed down through the generations. One Irish family carries an old, gold-rimmed drinking skull all the way down to the end of the book. As time passes, Rutherfurd brings in the famous Brian Boru, and we see the way the power balance works in Ireland - an important theme throughout the book.<br /><br />The middle two stories are where I found most of my disappointment. The first unfolds under the rule of the English Strongbow beginning in 1167, and the second leaps to 1370 and focuses briefly on the ongoing English / Irish struggles. Both of these two sections span only one chapter each and seem extremely underdeveloped, especially the second one. Character development is minimal, a few families are nearly entirely ignored, and the plot is brief and not memorable. The writing seems rushed as well, as if Rutherfurd himself couldn't wait to be finished with it.<br /><br />The final story, however, redeems the book, and I did enjoy it. Set in the 16th century, it recalls the influence in Ireland of the infamous English king, Henry VIII, his dissolution of the monasteries, and the ill-fated resistance movement of 'Silken Thomas,' the 10th Earl of Kildare. There are several interwoven and well-developed stories here, and the characters are also more fully rounded. The ending is not quite as satisfying as I would have liked, but of course one must remember that there is a second book coming, so perhaps that will give it the needed resolution. Nevertheless, the last few lines of the book are quite well done and are sure to leave the reader with a smile.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good book, though not Rutherfurd's best. I wish he'd put a little more emphasis on family ties, as he has done previously. We see the drinking skull passed down, but it isn't ever used (save for the very first story, and then its demise as the end of the book). It just sits there. In Rutherfurd's other books, a passed-down object is used and loved (or sometimes abused) by the family members that possess it through the generations.<br /><br />Similarly, the green eyes of the Fergus descendants and the red hair of the Harold family are common themes, but there just isn't a real feeling of connectedness within the families from one period of history to the next. I found myself having to constantly flip to the geneology tables to remember who was descended from whom. In addition, not all the families trace back to the beginning of the book. The Tidy family shows up for the first time in the fourth part of the book,and only plays a major role in the final section. There is no real feeling of history behind them.<br /><br />I did, however, very much enjoy the historical context of the book. Rutherfurd has done a tremendous amount of research and it shows. He has done some tweaking here and there for the story's sake - this is fiction after all - but the basic framework is all there. All the major events in Irish history are wonderfully laid out here, and I even learned many new things. Rutherfurd includes a note at the end that distinguishes the factual elements of the story from the fictional. Solid fans of Rutherfurd's books may be slightly disappointed, but this is still a very good book. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in Ireland, historical fiction, or both.n.

I received this as a gift from a mislead but well-meaning relative. Needless to say, I have never been a fan of opera. However, I was surprised that I was actually able to enjoy this book and accompanying CD. The book begins with a brief biography of Mozart, and then offers a prose overview of the story (extremely helpful for understanding!). The second half of the book contains the libretto, or text, of the opera. The original German forms one column on the left-hand side of each page, and the English translation is printed on the right. This way one can follow along with the story while listening to the music, even if you don't know a word of German. Throughout the entire book there are pictures from different stage performances of The Magic Flute. The musical recording is of high quality, contained on two disks that fit into pockets on the inside front and back cover of the book.<br />This would be a wonderful book for anyone interested in learning about opera, young or old. However, I must disagree with the reviewer who said this was geared toward children between three and seven. A 3-year-old would never be able to read the text, and a 7-year-old, unless very advanced, would no doubt struggle with it. The book is better suited for slightly older children all the way up through adults of any age. While I'm still not a fan of opera, I did gain some appreciation for it from this book and CD. I'm sure the only way to truly experience an opera is to see it performed live (just listening to a recording removes the entire visual element), but I would nevertheless recommend this product.	2004-04-21

Lawrence, once admittedly afraid of the creatures, is now a wolf biologist and has studied them for four decades. Much of the information here is based on his own first-hand observations. In the introduction he tells us of the incidents that brought him face-to-face with wolves and sparked his keen interest in them. From there on the book is divided into chapters on the definition and evolution of the wolf, the pack structure, hunting, family life, Lawrence's own experiences raising orphaned wolf pups, the interactions of wolves and humans, and the current status of wolves all over the world. Though some parts are outdated (the book was written in 1993), most of the information is still good today. Lawrence's writing is smooth and easy to read, and though a few biases come across, he does a decent job of keeping a factual base.<br />The book is also a definite visual treat. The pictures within are by a variety of different photographers, but they are well selected. All are clear, full color, and very beautiful. I do, however, wish some of them had been printed in a larger size; while some are full or half page, there are also many rather tiny ones. The pages are all aesthetically pleasing, with plenty of white space in the margins (bordering on too much, in some cases) so that nothing feels cramped. The lines of text are also nicely spaced, to make for unstrained reading. The pages are thick and glossy and give the book an elegant feel. I'd definitely recommend this to any fan of wolves, as it makes a beautiful coffee-table book and also an interesting read.	2004-04-20

Annemarie Zimmer was an Olympic contender at the young age of 18, when a tragic riding accident left her severely injured and emotionally shaken. Her extremely rare brindled horse, a Hanoverian named Highland Harry, was killed in the fall. Twenty years later, when this story picks up, she hasn't ridden since. But then her new life comes unraveled in almost every place - she loses her job, her teenage daughter drops out of school, her husband leaves her, and her father is diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis / Lou Gehrig's disease) - and Annemarie returns to her parents' farm and is forced to confront her past. Then, when a new horse unexpectedly enters her life, one whose unusual markings bring back painful memories of the deceased Harry, Annemarie's obsession with discovering the horse's identity leads her down a path that is both intriguing and frightening at the same time.<br /><br />The story sucked me in immediately. This, Gruen's first novel, is an absolute masterpiece. The story is narrated by the main character, Annemarie, and also told in present tense - an interesting literary device. This combination lends the book a liveliness and immediacy that fully engages the reader. In fact, I read the whole book in one day, staying up very late at night to finish it because I was so fascinated with the story. It is fast-paced and to-the-point, but contains all the little details that make the whole book seem real. It also helps immensely that the author is obviously a true horseperson herself. I am frequently disappointed by authors that write about horses when it is plain that they know nothing about them, but Gruen clearly knows her stuff.<br /><br />I also liked the fact that the heroine here is a very real person. She is not a perfect woman beset by circumstances entirely beyond her control, but has her own faults as well. As the story progresses, Annemarie discovers the ways in which she has contributed to her own misfortunes, and this acceptance of responsibility makes her even more likeable. She is a character we can all identify with because she is so very human. There are times when she is peevish, or overly protective of her daughter, or emotionally irrational. Despite all her best intentions she nearly ruins her parents' family business. But she also has moments of dry wit in reference to herself that are refreshing and funny. In addition, the author does an excellent job of developing the relationships between all the characters of the story. Each one is multi-dimensional, and has both strengths and weaknesses. We also see Annemarie's inner turmoil over how to face her father's illness. Sara Gruen is a talented writer, and has woven a beautiful story here.

This is the perfect guidebook for any hummingbird enthusiast in the western United States. It begins with basic hummingbird information on physical characteristics, feeding habits, territory, behavior, vocalizations, life cycle, and migration. The book then goes into specific profiles of the 18 species found in this region: Green Violet-ear, Broad-billed, White-eared, Berylline, Buff-bellied, Violet-crowned, Blue-throated, Magnificent, Plain-capped, Lucifer, Ruby-throated, Black-chinned, Anna's, Costa's, Calliope, Broad-tailed, Rufous, and Allen's. Each profile includes the common name, Latin name, Spanish name, and information on the bird's range, physical appearance and coloration, behavior, call sounds, habitat, diet and feeding habits, courtship and nesting, and the origin of the species' name. For most species there are pictures of both the male and female, though a few picture only the male. The pictures are large, clear, and very beautiful. There are also brief descriptions of three species not native to the American west, but which have been spotted here on rare occasions: the Green-breasted Mango, the Xantus's Hummingbird, and the Cinnamon Hummingbird.<br />The latter part of the book is devoted to tips on gardening to attract hummingbirds. There is an explanation of hummingbirds and pollinators, information on the needs of hummingbirds (for shelter, nesting, and climate, as well as food), and a list of flowering plants that hummingbirds favor. They are most attracted to flowers that are red, pink, or orange in color. The book gives both the common and scientific name of each plant suggested, as well as it's native habitat and the elevations at which it grows best. Several of the plants are pictured as well. At the end of the book there is a brief section on hummingbird feeders, detailing the most effective varieties, and simple guidelines on sugar-water mixtures and ways to deter bees and ants. The entire book is well-written and provides all the vital information for identifying the hummingbirds in your area.

All Other Horse Lovers Including Handicappers	Books	2	79	80	N	N	States the obvious and strays off-topic.	I was rather disappointed with this book for several reasons. First and foremost, the bulk of the book does not, as the title would have us believe, focus on the body language of horses. A couple of chapters devote themselves to brief descriptions of horse behavior under different circumstances (when happy, angry, frightened, bored, tired, hot, cold, hungry, thirsty, etc.), but the largest sections of the book concern curing problem horses and training foals. At the end there is a chapter on observing the body language of racehorses in order to pick winners, and two appendices on how to buy a horse.<br />Not only does the book stray from it's purported topic, but the information that IS given about equine body language is so basic and obvious that any true horseperson would already know it, and any aspiring horseperson could learn it all in a matter of a few weeks spent around the creatures. Of course a nervous horse will work up a sweat, a bored horse will get mouthy, and a horse that is irritated by a fly will swish its tail and twitch its skin. There are really only two forseeable uses, in my mind, for this book. The first is as a reference for those who know next to nothing about horses and wish to learn. The second, a slightly different version of the first, is as a guide to non-equestrian racegoers in order to pick winning horses on which to place their bets (and this is not surefire or guaranteed in any way, since pre-race behavior is only one of many factors that determines the outcome of a race).<br />The book is also considerably old, and a bit dated. It was written and first published in 1980, more than two decades ago. While the basic behavior of horses hasn't changed in that time, much else in the horse world has, including attitudes toward the care and training of horses. There are now many more effecting training methods than those presented here, and one passage in the book even alarmed me. Though they pronounce it a \\"dubious last resort,\\" the authors nevertheless included the following method for \\"[teaching] manners to a resistant horse\\":<br />\\". . . dramatic effects are obtained by striking the animal over the poll bone with a fragile wine bottle filled with a slush of sand and warm water. When the bottle breaks and the warm, moist substance dribbles down its head, the savage horse becomes a trembling wreck.

In addition, the authors make a great many generalizations about equine behavior and do not allow much leeway for differences in personality. As any person who spends much time around horses knows, one can be vastly different from the next. I said earlier that this book had two conceivable uses, but even for those I would not recommend purchasing this book.

Note: This review refers to the book \\"Her Stories\\" and NOT \\"Second Cousins,\\" though for some reason reviews of both books appear on both product pages.<br /><br />\\"Her Stories\\" is a delightful collection of nineteen stories from African American culture, retold by award-winning author Virginia Hamilton. The stories are divided into five categories: Her Animal Tales, Her Fairy Tales, Her Supernatural, Her Folkways and Legends, and Her True Tales. Each story focuses on a female, African American protagonist, and is about 3-4 pages in length. Hamilton's writing is vivid and colorful, yet remains simple enough that younger readers should have no trouble. The stories would also be great to read aloud. While Hamilton has translated the tales into contemporary language for easier understanding, she leaves a few conventions from Creole, Gullah, and other forms of speech that are best read aloud for full effect.<br /><br />The book is also a great study in African American literary and oral tradition, and is suitable for adults as well as children. Each story is followed by commentary from the author, providing the history of the tale, how it reflects African American heritage, explanation of any unusual aspects of the story, and any additional points of interest. Some of the stories are based in history, and others are entirely ficitonal. Some bear likenesses to more familiar tales as well - \\"Catskinella\\" is an alternative form of the popular Cinderella story, and \\"Little Girl and Buh Rabby,\\" comes from the tradition of Brer Rabbit stories.<br /><br />\\"Her Stories\\" is also beautifully illustrated, bringing out the best in each tale. At the end of the book Hamilton has included some reflections on her own childhood, and how her mother influenced her decision to compile stories about strong African American women.

US	46057280	R2W1U5OYYMHT7S	0879804467	544351442	Understanding Horses	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Great guide to better communication with horses!	I received this book as a gift years ago, but never got around to reading it until now. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, since the book has obviously gotten little publicity, but I was pleasantly surprised! Garda Langley, an owner and breeder of Arabian horses in Australia, has put together a terrific guide to understanding and communicating with your horse. The book covers every aspect of owning and caring for a horse, and is divided into chapters on the history of human communication with horses, the needs of horses, their emotions, anxiety, the ways horses communicate with one another, temperament and intelligence, habits, instinct and motivation, breeding, breaking / training, equine illness, and the suitability of different horses for different jobs.<br />I found the text very easy to understand, and Langley's reasoning to be sound. She points out many of the unconscious mistakes horse owners make, explains what negative effects result from these actions, and offers more efficient alternatives. She also details the ways in which horses perceive the world around them, which explains many of the equine behaviors often seen as irrational quirks. Langley also includes a multitude of specific case examples to illustrate her points. In fact, these short stories often make the case themselves, without additional explanation being necessary.<br />The only thing that may take some getting used to is Langley's use of Australian terms and phrases that might not be known to an American reader. For example, a halter is called a &quot;head collar,&quot; a blanket is a &quot;rug,&quot; a trailer is a &quot;float,&quot; a crop is a &quot;cane,&quot; and when she says &quot;stable&quot; she means an individual stall, and not the whole barn. Additionally, when rewarding a horse for a job well done you do not praise him or pat him, but rather you &quot;make much of him.&quot; For the most part the meanings of these terms are clear from the context, though it did take me a moment to figure out what a float was.<br />A couple of the issues Langley discusses bother me slightly, but they are not really errors, and so I don't feel a need to detract any rating points. First, Langley is very quick to attribute many horses' keen perceptions to clairvoyance or telepathy, when they could just as easily be due to some subtle sensory cue that the horse is attuned to and we are not (for example, elephants can communicate over long distances using sounds too low in frequency for the human ear to detect). She gives one rather dubious example of a man who tested this by setting out several buckets, only one of which contained oats: &quot;He found that he could direct a free horse to choose the correct feed bucket . . . by vizualising in his own mind the oats lying in the bottom&quot; (pg. 80). Now, I'm sure all horse owners know how good horses can be at locating treats, and it seems far more likely that the horse simply smelled the oats in the oat-filled bucket and chose accordingly.<br />The one other thing I'll make note of is that Langley cites horses as being color blind. The book was written in 1988, so it fits the belief of the time, but since then it has been determined that horses can see certain colors (apparently not all), though they may appear differently to equines than to humans. But this is simply a note of interest and I do not fault the author in light of the fact that this was written more than 15 years ago.<br />The insights and advice Langley offers us here is invaluable. By pointing out common errors horse people make and explaining what should be done instead, she provides the answers to numerous problems horse owners may have. And being a horse owner herself, she has had ample opportunity to study them. By making only a few simple changes in routine, one can find that they have a healthier horse, a more willing mount, a horse that learns more quickly, or a breeding program with a higher rate of conception. Her solutions are simple and straightforward, and are achievable by anyone. I definitely recommend this book to anyone in regular contact with horses, be you an owner, trainer, breeder, or simply a weekend rider.d straightforward, and are achievable by anyone.

US	46057280	RJ72CRE0JXAKP	0252071255	177709654	Wild Echoes: Encounters with the Most Endangered Animals in North America	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Largely outdated, but provides good historical information.	I'm not sure exactly how to rate this one - I've been hedging between a 3.5 and a four, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and going with a four. For the time it was published (originally in 1990), it's probably a four-star book. What Bergman has done here is compiled his personal experiences with nine different endangered species (all North American). He's devoted a chapter to each: the wolf, the dusky seaside sparrow (now extinct), the California condor, the Florida Panther, the manatee, the Puerto Rican parrot, the black-footed ferret, the North Atlantic right whale, and the ivory-billed woodpecker (possibly extinct in North America). In each chapter Bergman gives us both a personal account (he has seen all of the above listed species in the wild except the dusky seaside sparrow, the last individuals of which were in captivity at the time, and have since died), and then explains both the history and current status of the species and what, if anything, is currently being done to help save it.<br />However, having been written in 1990, much of the &quot;current&quot; information is vastly outdated (particularly on the wolf and condor), so if you want the latest news, you'd be better off looking elsewhere. Steve Grooms's &quot;Return of the Wolf&quot; is an excellent and comprehensive text on wolves, and while it too is a bit outdated, having been written in 1999, it is more recent than &quot;Wild Echoes&quot; by far, and much more factual. Lots of the information on wolves that Bergman provides here is either no longer true, or wasn't true at the time and has since been proven false (and, ironically, Bergman concentrates almost entirely on wolves in Alaska - the only place in America where wolves are NOT endangered). However, the historical background provided for each animal is very good (and quite interesting!), making this book more suited for historical study than as a reference on current events.<br />One other thing that concerns me is the philosophical side of Bergman's writing. He often writes in circles, and while I can understand and empathize with the gut responses he has to certain animals' situations, in the text he frequently contradicts himself. He says that when humans talk of &quot;saving endangered species,&quot; it separates humans from other animals and gives us power over them, and he rails against this mentality, and yet he still emphasizes most strongly that we need to save them. He both rails against biologists, and alternately praises them hightly. Bergman also argues that starting captive breeding programs for severely endangered species is just another power-trip for humans, but does (almost grudgingly) admit that they do some good. And the most contradictory, he says: &quot;I don't want more commonness. I want more of the rare&quot; (pg. 240). He does not seem to recognize the fact that, once we have more of the species that are now rare, they will no longer be rare and will then be &quot;common&quot; themselves. Bergman also states in one chapter that today's culture is responsible for all endangered species. I understand what he meant, but it was poorly stated, considering that many, many species went extinct for various reasons before humans even existed.<br />But as I said before, outdatedness and philosophical loops aside, this is still a very worthwhile read for anyone interested in the history of these endangered species. Bergman has obviously done a great deal of research. The author's personal encounter stories are also interesting. The book is well-written and easy to read, with vivid and touching imagery (though I must admit I found Bergman's description of the right whale's body shape as &quot;unavoidably phallic&quot; (pg. 216) to be a less-than-attractive analogy, though he seems to have meant it as a compliment). The book also includes black-and-white photos of some of the species discussed, an appendix listing extinct species of the United States, and a second appendix withcontact information for many wildlife advocacy groups. Though this is certainly not a definitive work on endangered species, it is nonetheless informative, interesting, and well worth the read.contact information for many wildlife advocacy groups.

US	46057280	R33Q98KQ87PPJQ	1879431033	256985442	Ultimate Horse Book	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A decent introduction to the horse for beginning equestrians	This book is a fairly good introductory reference to horses, suited for younger riders and horse enthusiasts just entering the horse world. It is well written and easy to understand. The first section of the book is entitled &quot;The Essential Horse,&quot; and covers its evolution, domestication, the basics of conformation (including several very nice diagrams), the gaits (with nice photographic sequences of the walk, trot, canter, and gallop), the coat colors, the horse's senses, and behavior and communication. Most of this information is good, but the reader should disregard almost everything the author says about color genetics, as the majority of the information here is vastly outdated and has since been proven false (the book was published in 1991, so this is not surprising). A better reference to horse color would be Phillip Sponenberg's &quot;Equine Color Genetics,&quot; though that text is not aimed at younger readers.<br />The bulk of the book is devoted to profiles on several different breeds of horse. Only a small sampling of breeds are included, but most of the major, most popular ones are covered. Each profile page includes information on the history of the breed, its influence on other breeds, its use, conformation, temperatment, and any other interesting facts. Most of the basic information is good, though there are occasional errors. There is a large, bull-body profile picture of each breed, often a headshot, and sometimes a few other photos or drawings. The breeds included are (in order):<br />Arabian, Barb, Andalusian, Thoroughbred, Anglo-Arab, Shagya Arabian, Lusitano, Akhal-Teke, Lipizzaner, Budonny, Kabardin, Don, Morgan, Quarter Horse, Hackney, French Trotter, Orlov Trotter, Standardbred, Friesian, American Saddlebred, Missouri Fox Trotter, Tennessee Walking Horse, Peruvian Paso, Mustang, Irish Draft, Norman Cob, Cleveland Bay, Gelderlander, Dutch Warmblood, Fredericksborg, Selle Francais, Danish Warmblood, Trakehner, Hanoverian, Holsteiner, Maremmana, Murgese, Oldenburg, Camargue, Rocky Mountain Horse, Furioso, Nonius, Knabstrupper, Pinto*, Palomino*, Australian Stock Horse, Appaloosa, Bashkir Curly, Landais, Ariegeois, Haflinger, Italian Heavy Draft, Norwegian Fjord, Icelandic Horse, Caspian, Falabella, Exmoor Pony, Dartmoor Pony, Welsh Mountain Pony, Welsh Pony, Welsh Cob, Dales Pony, Fell Pony, Highland Pony, Shetland Pony, Connemara, New Forest Pony, American Shetland, Shire, Suffolk, Clydesdale, Percheron, Ardennais, Breton, Jutland, Boulonnais, and Belgian.<br />* = the Pinto and Palomino, while presented in this book as breeds, are NOT actually breeds, but just colors. There are registries for these colors, but they accept horses of any breed, and are not actually breed registries.<br />There are also pages detailing the different &quot;types&quot; of horse (regardless of breed), suited for different tasks and disciplines: the hunter, the polo pony, the hack / riding horse, the cob, and the riding pony.<br />The third section is entitled &quot;You and Your Horse&quot; and covers the various aspects of horse ownership and care. Topics include how to buy a horse, stable maintenance, equipment for riding and care, riding clothes, grooming, shoeing, feeding, health care, pregnancy and birth, and foal development. This information is very basic, and you should of course consult experts before buying your first horse - other horse owners, veterinarians, farriers, etc. The clothing styles represented are a little outdated, as fashion in the horse world changes just as it does elsewhere, so it's best to talk to other riders and tack store employees if you are unsure.<br />The final section of the book, &quot;The Horse and Man,&quot; discusses the various uses of the horse for both work and sport. It begins with the history of the horse as a labor animal, including the horse in war, as transportation, as a construction implement, and as an agricultural tool. It then goes into the different sporting disciplines: driving, classical equitation, western riding, hunting, dressage, show jumping, eventing, racing (including flat racing, steeplechase, and harness racing), polo, endurance riding, and sidesaddle. At the end of the book there is a glossary of key terms. Though this book isn't perfect, it's a good place to start. The topics covered are comprehensive, and the photography is good.

US	46057280	R3IXKAKM9HUM6F	0451525264	996904481	Les Miserables	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A vivid and captivating story of humanity in all its forms.	This 1400+ page book follows the life of Jean Valjean, a man sentenced to nineteen years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread. The story begins in 1815, shortly after Jean Valjean is released from prison. He seeks lodging for the night with a bishop, but steals away the next morning with a set of valuable silver. Caught, he is brought back to the bishop, who proceeds to make him a gift of the silver, and tells him to use it to start a new life for himself. Due to constraints on review length, I will not go into a full synopsis here - I'm sure you can find a good overview of the story in one of the other numerous reviews here, but rather I will discuss some key aspects of the text.<br />I really loved this book. Hugo's writing is excellent, and he does a superb job of tying all ends of the story together. Nothing in the book is irrelevant to the central plot, even if the connection cannot be seen immediately. Hugo captures the intricacies of human interaction, and how one event can set off a chain reaction. For example, if Monsieur Myriel, the Bishop of Digne, had not forgiven Jean Valjean for his theft and given the silver to him under the condition that Jean Valjean use it to make a better life for himself, then Jean Valjean would never have reformed. He would not have settled down, become Monsieur Madeleine, and built a fortune and good reputation. If this had not happened, then Jean Valjean would not have become connected with Fantine. He would not have become Cosette's benefactor. Cosette would have grown up with the abusive family to whose care she was entrusted, and would have lived a miserable life. She certainly would never have met Marius.<br />This book, set in the decades following the reign of Napoleon, provides tons of information on the time period. Reading the reactions of different characters to historical events helped me better understand the differing mentalities of the era. Marius, raised by his grandfather, adopts anti-revolutionary ideas and disapproves of the Napoleon. But when Marius finally discovers the truth of his father, he switches viewpoints. His father served under Napoleon, and had beliefs in direct opposition to Marius's grandfather's. When his father dies, Marius is gripped with guilt at having shunned him. He takes it upon himself to learn all he can about Napoleon and his time, and ultimately adopts his father's philosophy, estranging himself from his grandfather. This highlights the societal rifts created by differing political viewpoints, even between family members.<br />Hugo had two main points to make in this book. One, that every action has consequences, often surpassing expectation; and two, that life is not black and white - there are shades of grey. I have addressed the first of these with the example of the kindness shown to Jean Valjean by the Bishop of Digne. The second point is well-made via the character of Javert. The police inspector is driven by duty. For him, something is either right or wrong, with no middle ground. Jean Valjean has broken the law and must be punished. Motives and circumstances make no difference - a crime is a crime. Because of his inflexible viewpoint, Javert is shaken when Jean Valjean later spares his life. He would rather have been shot than saved by a criminal. His upheaval is compounded when he discovers Jean Valjean, carrying Marius, at the exit of the sewer. A criminal that saves not one, but two peoples' lives is incomprehensible to him. Javert fails to reach a conclusion that satisfies his strict philosophy. He cannot bring himself to condemn the man that has saved his life and asked nothing in return, but not to do so would go against what he sees as his duty. Caught between these two ideas, and unable to justify either, he throws himself into the Seine and drowns. Had Javert been able to see the world in shades of grey, he would have realized that Jean Valjean was a victim of circumstance - a good man, forced by events beyond his control tobreak the law.<br />Some books are difficult to understand due to a lack of supplied background information. Les Miserables is just the opposite. For the most part I really enjoyed the book, but there are several point at which Hugo goes overboard in his description, to the point where the information isn't necessary. These sequences become tedious at times, like slogging through a deep mire. My motivation to go on was the interest I had in the central story, knowing that eventually the book would return there. Examples of such overly long tangents include the Battle of Waterloo sequence, the description of Paris street life, the history of the convent where Jean Valjean and Cosette hide, and the history of the Paris sewers. At these points it seemed almost as if Hugo were attempting to make the book into a history text, rather than a novel.<br />On the whole, however, I was very satisfied with the book. As I have said, Hugo's writing is excellent. His detailed descriptions of everything in the story makes it come alive. Referencing specific street names in Paris gives it realism. Minute details of human interrelations are captured vividly, and one feels as if the characters are real. There were points where I felt great compassion for Jean Valjean in his nobleness despite hardship, and places where I detested Marius for his insensitivity. There were places at which I was greatly annoyed with Cosette for her naivete and submissiveness, and toward the end I even pitied Javert for his inability to resolve his internal turmoil. The invocation of such emotions in the reader are signs of a good writer. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. It will remain one of my favorites for a long time to come.break the law.<br />Some books are difficult to understand due to a lack of supplied background information.

US	46057280	RXXMNQPHZ935Y	0452280680	184747831	The Parrot's Lament: And Other True Tales of Animal Intrigue, Intelligence, and Ingenuity	Books	4	13	16	N	N	A good book, with some unsettling errors...	I thoroughly enjoyed reading this exploration of animal intelligence. Linden writes clearly and succinctly, and does a great job of weaving his stories together to support the points he makes. He has taken examples from both his personal experience, and from numerous print sources and interviews with other people. Most of the stories revolve around captive animals (as pets and in zoos - primarily because these are more easily observed), though some examples from the wild are included. In addition, an overwhelming number of these case studies involve the great apes (particularly orangutans and gorillas) and dolphins. This is to be expected, as these species are generally considered to be among the most intelligent, but there are also tales of birds, pigs, large cats, and others.<br />The book is divided into nine categories. He begins with &quot;Games and Humor,&quot; in which he explores the ways in which animals amuse themselves. &quot;Trade and Barter&quot; was one of the most interesting chapters, detailing the elaborate systems captive apes have been taught, where they can earn &quot;money&quot; for performing tasks for their keepers, and then spend that money on items they want, such as treats or toys. &quot;Deception&quot; discusses ways animals have tried to fool both their human counterparts and others of their own species. In &quot;Mind Reading and Mental Chess&quot; Linden explores the extent to which animals can be aware of others' states of mind. &quot;Cooperation in Work, Conflict, and Healing&quot; is another particularly interesting chapter, offering examples of service animals that have gone beyond their training to help humans. Included are stories of animals that actually seek out ill and injured people in order to offer them solace. &quot;Tools and Intelligence&quot; concerns that very sticky topic of whether humans, as tool-users, are unique. It appears that we are not, and Linden shows us numerous cases where other species have made use of tools to achieve their aims. The seventh chapter talks of escape attempts - cases where captive animals have shown remarkable ingenuity despite all their keepers' efforts to dissuade them. &quot;Empathy and Heroism&quot; gives us examples of animal heroes, and finally &quot;A Place Where Humans are the Novelty&quot; takes a brief look at those few wild places that are still relatively untouched by humans.<br />While I really liked the book as a whole, however, there are a few things which cause me to knock my rating down to only four stars. First is that Linden undermines much of his own thesis by devoting an entire preface as a disclaimer that none of these stories can be used as scientific evidence. Perhaps the stories are anecdotal, but this is how much of scientific discovery begins - with pure observation of things. For those of us with wide exposure to animals, it is hard to deny that they do possess some remarkable mental capabilities, even without these stories as additional proof.<br />And secondly, Linden has done a very poor job of checking his facts. Many of his examples come from animals at the Woodland Park Zoo, which is very close to where I live, and which I have visited numerous times. The first error that leapt out at me is relatively minor - the orangutan Linden refers to as &quot;Tawan&quot; is actually named Towan. But more alarming, one of Linden's stories involves the gorillas at Woodland Park. He claims that the gorilla Jumoke, when separated from the father of her baby, repeatedly tried to climb out of her new enclosure to rejoin him. This is all well and good, except that the &quot;father&quot; is billed as Alafia. Anyone can check the Woodland Park Zoo's website ([...]) and see that Alafia is, in fact, a female. So something is not right with that particular story. It could be that Linden just mixed up the names - there are a LOT of gorillas at Woodland park - but errors like this make me question the accuracy of the other accounts included. Has Linden made other mistakes in his research?<br />Overall, though, I would still recommend this book to anyone with a casual interest animal intelligence. Some of the stories are heartwarming, others funny, and others downright amazing. The book is friendly to the layman and does not require any scientific knowledge. It is also well-written and easy to read. If you're doing a study or writing a paper, I would strongly advise you to double-check the specifics of any accounts you intend to reference (due to the above mentioned errors), but for general-interest purposes this book is good enough as is. It's a great testament to the often vastly underestimated intellectual powers of our furry, feathery, and scaly friends.s Linden made other mistakes in his research?<br />Overall, though, I would still recommend this book to anyone with a casual interest animal intelligence.

The text is divided into eight sections: The Origins of the Horse, The Horse in the Ancient World, The Warhorse, The Working Horse, The Riding Horse, Haute Ecole &amp; Showmanship, The Hunter and Sports Horse, and The Racehorse. The only major topic that seems to have been skipped over is the horse in the American west (though a couple western paintings are included). The information provided is concisely written, but comprehensive and accurate. The artwork is very well chosen. All pieces are beautifully printed in full-color, and encompass a wide variety of media and styles, including realism, impressionism, romanticism, pointillism, cubism, pen and ink, watercolor, engraving, fresco, sculpture, bas relief, mosaic, woodblock prints, pottery, tapestry, and manuscript illuminations. Specific artists represented include George Stubbs, Sir Alfred Munnings, Sir Edwin Landseer, John Wootton, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Rembrandt Van Rijn, Edgar Degas, Edouard Manet, and Elizabeth Butler, among others. This book would make a very nice coffee-table item for its great artwork, or an educational tool for those interested in a nice overview of the horse in history.	2004-03-28

From the time he was a little boy, Norman Vaughan knew he could never be content with a mundane, conventional life. He and a friend constructed their first dog team by tying two mutts to a Flexible Flyer sled. At fifteen, Norman obtained his father's grudging permission to spend a week living off the land on a beach. Upon entering college at Harvard, he found himself bored. He knew it wasn't the life he wanted. So when Norman heard of the upcoming Antarctic exhibition, to be led by Admiral Richard E. Byrd, he lost no time in contacting the admiral. He managed to win himself a spot on the team. From that moment on, Norman Vaughan has lived a life full of excitement. I read my mother's copy of this book, which is signed by the author with his personal motto: &quot;Dream Big and Dare to Fail.&quot; For his entire life, Vaughan lived by those words.<br />Returning from Antarctica, he felt depression creeping back, and he knew he could never live a &quot;normal&quot; life again. He dropped out of Harvard. Vaughan joined the army and spent years doing search-and-rescue operations by dogsled. He became known for his hair-brained schemes, such as dropping dogs by parachute into locations too remote to reach otherwise. But by and large, his schemes always seemed to work. When he left the army, it wasn't the end of his adventures. He returned to Antarctica on several occasions. Vaughan also entered the 1,000+ mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Alaska 13 times. And on 16 December 1994, three days before his 89th birthday, Vaughan climbed the Antarctic mountain that Admiral Byrd had named for him 65 years earlier.<br />For anyone with an adventurous streak, or even those who simply dream of such a life, this book is a sure winner. Norman Vaughan is one of the most inspirational human beings this world has seen. Most of his ambitious ideas met with much resistance from those around him, but not once did he give up. Sometimes he spent years fighting for what he wanted, and almost invariably he would win out in the end. When he was not invited to participate in the 50th anniversary trip to commemorate Byrd's 1929 expedition to Antarctica, Vaughan called every person he could think of who was involved. Eventually he was offered a place on the team.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing autobiography. There are a couple of awkward grammatical and punctuation errors, but they are few and far between. For the most part the book is written in easy-to-read language. What did irritate me was that Vaughan consistently mis-spelled the name of Joe Redington, Sr. (he added an extra &quot;d&quot; every time), the founder of the Iditarod. But this is a very minor quibble, and since most people have probably never heard of Redington to begin with, it doesn't make much difference in the end. The last chapter of the book is actually written by Vaughan's wife, and recalls their climb to the top of Mount Vaughan. Also included is a selection of black-and-white photos of Vaughan on his different adventures throughout his life.

This is a great collection of international folk tales for children. Some of the stories included are fairly common (i.e. &quot;The Three Billy Goats Gruff&quot;), while others may be new to you. It's been one of my favorites since I was young. The writing is very simple, so it can either be read aloud to a child or they can read it themselves. Most of the stories have some sort of moral or lesson, though others are simply good for a laugh. Each tale is, as the book's title suggests, from a different part of the world, as follows:<br />Norway: &quot;The Three Billy Goats Gruff&quot; - This story is known by most children, but seems to be a favorite. This version is traditional - three goats wish to cross a bridge to reach a pasture on the other side, but must first outwit the hungry troll that lurks beneath.<br />Spain: &quot;Little Half-Chick&quot; - Here a spoiled young chicken is so full of himself that he refuses to help those that ask for his assistance. Eventually he is taught a grave lesson as those whom he spurned catch up with him to mete out punishment.<br />India: &quot;Tit for Tat&quot; - A camel carries a jackal (who cannot swim) across a river so the camel can eat sugar cane and the jackal can collect fish and crabs. But the jackal betrays his friend, alerting villagers to the camel's presence in the canefield. The camel then throws the jackal into the water on the return trip. I found this story slightly disturbing.<br />Germany: &quot;The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids&quot; - This is similar to the story of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood.&quot; Seven goat kids are left at home and told not to open the door for strangers. A wolf tricks them and eats them, and then takes a nap. The mother goat finds him and swaps the eaten kids for large rocks.<br />Russia: &quot;The Little Snow Maiden&quot; - An old man and woman, sad that they have had no children, decide to build a snow maiden one winter. She comes to life and brings them much happiness, but then disappears when summer arrives.<br />Rumania: &quot;Why the Woodpecker Has a Long Beak&quot; - This is another version of the Greek myth of Pandora's box. Here an old woman is given a sack and told not to open it. Of course, she does, and unleashes a multitude of bugs, and as punishment is turned into a woodpecker who must re-collect all the insects.<br />Japan: &quot;Little Peachling&quot; - The point of this story was rather lost on me. It tells of a boy found in a giant peach. He departs one day for the island of the ogres to &quot;put an end to their evil mischief-making.&quot; With some friends, he ultimately sends the ogres packing and collects their treasure.<br />England: &quot;Lazy Jack&quot; - This is another story that seems to have no message other than that bumbling blockheads can stumble upon good fortune. It's still entertaining, however, as we see Lazy Jack repeatedly make stupid mistakes while trying to help his mother. He ultimately marries a beautiful girl after making her laugh for the first upon seeing him carrying a donkey on his shoulder (much like the story of &quot;The Golden Goose&quot;).<br />France: &quot;The Three Wishes&quot; - Here we get the &quot;think before you speak&quot; lesson, as a woodcutter is granted three wishes by a small man he meets in the forest. The woodcutter and his wife proceed to spoil the first two wishes and use the third to return to their old way of life.<br />Central Africa: &quot;Why Cat and Rat Are No Longer Friends&quot; - This is an interesting &quot;how things came to be this way&quot; story. Cat and Rat set out on a journey in a boat made of cassava root. Rat gets hungry and begins to eat holes in the boat. The boat sinks, and Cat is forever disillusioned with Rat.<br />North America: &quot;The Eagles of Lost Opportunity&quot; - A young Native American boy is determined to get only the best feathers for his headdress. He passes up many opportunities, refusing to settle for inferior feathers.

Having grown up in Alaska, I've had much exposure to Native Alaskan culture and have always loved reading or hearing their folklore. This particular book is a great collection of Tlingit-Haida legends, each of which is a sort of &quot;how things came to be this way&quot; story. They explain why a certain clan took a particular crest, or how a legendary hero came to fame, etc. What I found especially interesting is the comparison with folklore from other cultures. Each story is accompanied by a short introduction in which the author shows us the parallels between these tales and similar ones in Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology. The stories are set down in clear, simple language, but are still vivid and engrossing. My one criticism of the book would be that it's too short. There are only nine legends included, and this makes for only a small sampling of Tlingit-Haida lore. I would have loved to see more. However, I will not knock any point off my rating for this. The fact that I wish it had gone on longer only attests to its overall quality. This is a terrific book, easy to read, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in native folklore.	2004-03-24
US	46057280	R2XOIDJ90W7A9L	0060191465	989481203	Wild About Horses: Our Timeless Passion for the Horse	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Nice collection of horse tales with a wide variety of themes	The author, Lawrence Scanlan, is something of a 'born-again' horse lover, by his own proclamation. He admits that for much of his life he failed to see the overwhelming appeal that many people find in horses. But as an adult, in preparation for his job as co-author of \\"Riding High\\" with show jumping champion Ian Millar, Scanlan started to take riding lessons. Soon he was hooked. Although he still does not have horses of his own, he now loves riding and spending time in the company of our equine companions. As he read more and more about the equine creature, he became fascinated with the intertwined histories of humans and horses. This is what led him to write \\"Wild About Horses,\\" a collection of [mostly true, some fictional] stories celebrating this inter-species bond.<br />Scanlan does not really have a central thesis, but rather explores the numerous ways in which horses have participated in and impacted humans throughout history and into the present day. His writing is fluid and to the point. The book is divided into ten chapters, each with a slightly different theme, covering such stories as the following (these are not the only stories he addresses, but just a sampling to give you an idea):<br />Horses in rituals and sacrifices through history; Pegasus; the Trojan Horse; Scanlan's own horseback trip in Wyoming; the history of mustangs; Wild Horse Annie; the evolution of the horse; the domestication of horses; horses as a food source; Xenophon; Native American horsemanship; trainer John Solomon Raney in the 1850s; trainers Monty Roberts and Tom Dorrance; Alexander the Great and Bucephalus; the history of warhorses; the Huns and Mongols; Medieval knights; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Comanche and the Battle of Little Bighorn; Napoleon and Marengo; Wellington and Copenhagen; Roy Rogers and Trigger; Eadweard Muybridge's motion photography; the Lone Ranger and Silver; the books \\"Black Beauty,\\" \\"Misty of Chincoteague,\\" \\"My Friend Flicka,\\" and \\"Smoky the Cow Horse\\"; the movie \\"National Velvet\\"; author and former jockey Dick Francis; equine athletes Ruffian, Northern Dancer, Secretariat, Phar Lap, Man O'War, Big Ben, Halla, and Arkle; cattle drives; Scanlan's own stay at a working ranch; A.E. Tschiffley's 10,000 mile ride across the Americas; Barbara Whittome's 2,500 mile ride across Russia; Welsh Pony breeders Dick & Adele Rockwell; the Pony Express, and Buffalo Bill Cody; Snow Man, a horse rescued from slaughter that went on to become a champion jumper; Marocco the 'dancing horse'; Clever Hans; horse psychic Fred Kimball; and the bonds horses form with other animals.<br />While I did enjoy reading this book, I have a few criticisms. First and foremost, Scanlan seems to have borrowed heavily from the book \\"The Man Who Listens to Horses\\" by Monty Roberts (for which Scanlan wrote the introduction and afterword). He has used material both from his own contributions to the book, as well as Roberts's own writing, often using identical phrasing. This parroting was especially evident since I have only just finished reading Roberts's book, and was somewhat disappointing. The sense of repetition is also furthered by the fact that most of these stories are very common ones, and I've heard about 75% of them before. They're not bad stories, but I do wish Scanlan had dug a little deeper for some less commonly heard-of accounts to include.<br />Furthermore, Scanlan's coverage is not balanced. He leaves out vast areas of the horse world. The book has plenty of material on riding horses and ponies, but almost nothing on draft horses. The \\"Sport Horse Legends\\" chapter focuses almost entirely on Thoroughbred racehorses. There are a few jumpers thrown in, but no Western horses at all. When he talks of horse trainers, he talks a great deal about Monty Roberts, and a little bit about a couple others, but does not even mention many of the most influencial trainers of the last few decades. At times I also questioned the author's analytical skills, particularly when he dismissed a story as false on the basis that the horse involved, reported to be a palomino, had a Spanish name that translated to Cinnamon (which he said was too dark a color for palomino). However, this does not seem so far-fetched to me, as my father once owned a small black dog named Big Red...<br />And finally, his writing is not completely focused on the supposed subject of the book - why humans love horses. He has included an overwhelming number of stories about horse abuse, and most don't even lead into more uplifting stories. In the \\"Epic Rides\\" chapter, he even commends several long-distance riders known for riding horses to death. Even more strange to me was the fact that, although much of the first chapter talks mildly and even respectfully about the ways horse skins and heads were used to adorn ancient holy spots, Scanlan later launches into a tirade against equine taxidermy and condemns horsemen such as Roy Rogers, who chose to have Trigger preserved and mounted.<br />However, despite its faults, I did like the book. It was not perfect, but it was enjoyable. I did find some of the stories to be new and quite interesting, and Scanlan's extensive list of recommended further reading has lengthened the list of books I plan to read. If you're a connoisseur of horse lore, \\"Wild About Horses\\" may not hold any surprises for you, but it is nevertheless a nice collection. It's easy reading, and the text is interspersed with many black-and-white photographs.

Carl Brenders is one of the most amazing artists in existence when it comes to realistic animal paintings. His work is so fine and detailed that it would be easy to mistake one of his pieces for a photograph. Being a fan of realism, I can't help but love his exquisite paintings. This book contains over fifty beautiful pieces, depicting a wide array of North American wildlife, including bears, deer, foxes, raccoons, wolves, cougars, squirrels, many species of bird, and more. Each painting is accompanied by its title, dimensions, media information, and year of completion, as well as a few paragraphs explaining the inspiration for that particular piece (written by Brenders himself). With some he has included preliminary sketches, all of which are fine drawings in and of themselves. The margins are large and there is plenty of &quot;white space&quot; (but not too much) so that the pages look balanced and uncluttered. At the end there is a short biography of the artist, discussing his childhood in Belgium, how he came to love animals and nature, his schooling in art, his career as an artist, and a little about his technique. This book would be a terrific coffee-table item or gift idea for any lover of wildlife art.	2004-03-16

I have always had a soft spot for King Henry VIII's wives and enjoyed reading about them, but never have I come across such a detailed, colorful, and engaging biography of them as this. Alison Weir has done a phenomenal amount of research in compiling this book. She provides us with countless details of the lives of these women, including excerpts from letters written by, addressed to, or about them. She also dispells many of the myths that have grown up around the six Queens. For instance, Anne Boleyn was not the promiscuous wanton she has often been described as, and Jane Seymour may not have been quite as sweet and innocent in nature as most people believed her to be. Coupled with her easy, fluid writing style, this factual detail brings each of the women to life. We get to know them intimately as Weir unlocks their widely varied personalities.<br />Katherine of Aragon (mother of Queen 'Bloody' Mary) was a loving and devoted wife to Henry for 24 years. When he ultimately cast her aside in hopes of finding a more fruitful wife (one who would provide him with a male heir, which Katherine had failed to do), she firmly maintained that she was the King's true wife, the Queen, and always would be. For the rest of her life, she never permitted anyone to call her anything but 'Queen', even though she lived out her last miserable years in a dank, unhealthy estate, with insufficient resources.<br />Anne Boleyn (mother of Queen Elizabeth I) was an outspoken and ambitious young woman, originally one of Katherine's waiting women. She caught the King's attention and Henry developed an overwhelming passion for her. His desire to rid himself of Katherine and marry Anne ultimately led the King to break with the Roman Catholic Church, something scandalous and unthinkable to most of his contemporaries. Unfortunately for her, Anne lacked sufficient discretion, and her political oponents found it all too easy to lay upon her false accusations that would result in her execution.<br />Henry once said that he loved Jane Seymour best of all his wives, perhaps because she succeeded where his other wives had failed - she gave Henry his heir, Edward VI. But Jane, much loved by many Englanders, did not occupy the position of Queen for long. Shortly after the birth of her son, she succumbed to infection and died. Henry remembered her as his favorite for the rest of his life, and ordered that he be buried at her side when he died.<br />Anne of Cleves, the shortest-lasting of Henry's Queens, was ultimately the most successful of the six women. Henry arranged to marry the German princess based solely on seeing one portrait of her. This portrait, however, had exaggerated her appearance, and when the King saw his new wife he was repulsed. He immediately sought a way out of the marriage. Anne could have faced a grimmer fate, except that she was cheerfully compliant where Katherine had been stubborn. The marriage was annulled with ease and the King, grateful for her cooperation, provided Anne with property, funds, and a title as his honorary sister.<br />Henry's next wife was not so fortunate. Katherine Howard was was only a young girl when she married the King, who thought of her as 'a rose without a thorn.' In Katherine, he found a way to recapture his youth. But Katherine was young and silly, and worst of all, sexually promiscuous. When the king found out, he was shattered, and Katherine soon followed in the footsteps of her predecessor and cousin, Anne Boleyn, and was executed before the age of 17.<br />Katherine Parr, Henry's sixth and final wife, served a different function than those who had come before her. By this time the aging King was in failing health and exceedingly fat. Katherine became more of a nursemaid for him, as well as a companion with whom he could converse. Within a few years, the King died, leaving Katherine a widow, free and in charge of her own fate. She re-married and had a daughter by her new husband, but died shortly afterward.<br/>The book is long, but well worth the read. Weir has done an extraordinary job of introducing us to these vibrant, diverse women. The book is full of information, facts, quotes - but the writing is very digestible and flows smoothly. Henry's first two wives are given the most attention - Katherine because she lasted the longest, and Anne because she has been saddled with such an infamous reputation. The other wives are not described in so much detail, but we still get to know them quite well. Weir takes us through the entire lives of these women, from their childhood and time before marrying the king, through the ends of their lives (which, in the cases of Anne of Cleves and Katherine Parr, extended beyond the King's own death).<br />Included in the book are several black and white images - mostly paintings of Henry, his family, his advisors, and of course, his wives. I would have liked to see these printed in color, but they are nice enough as is. At the back of the book, Weir has included genealogical tables of England's royal dynasties, the Tudor family, and each of Henry's wives. This is an extremely helpful reference for keeping track of the connections between various nobles that involved in the lives of the King and the women he married. 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII' was a great read, and I would highly recommend it./>The book is long, but well worth the read.

I made the grave mistake of trying to read this book while on a public bus. It wasn't long before I realized the folly in this, as I repeatedly had to stifle the wild guffaws that threatened to pour forth without my consent. The other passengers probably came to the conclusion that I was either very sick or slightly deranged as I rocked back and forth in my seat and tried to pretend that I was, in fact, merely coughing. Gary Paulsen has offered us one of the most hilarious accounts of running the Iditarod that I have ever come across.<br />Living in Minnesota, Paulsen had a small team of five dogs that he used to work his traplines. Over time he became more and more entranced with mushing, until he eventually realized that wanted to, needed to, run the Iditarod - the 1,100+ mile dogsled race stretching across the state of Alaska between Anchorage and Nome. The first half of the book deals with his preparation for the race - finding more dogs, training the dogs, getting the right equipment, etc. We soon see that he has quite a bit to learn. Over the course of this training period, Paulsen finds himself attacked by dogs, run away with by dogs, and often spending many miles being dragged along on the ground behind his sled by dogs. He manages to break his sled repeatedly, get separated from his team, and one night, get sprayed by five different skunks in rapid succession. He is, in short, one of the least qualified of all possible Iditarod candidates.<br />The second half of the book takes us through the race itself. In the beginning, he makes every possible rookie mistake. He gets lost before even leaving the city of Anchorage, after putting the wrong animal in the lead-dog position:<br />\\"We went through people's yards, ripped down fences, knocked over garbage cans. At one point I found myself going through a carport and across a backyard with fifteen dogs and a fully loaded Iditarod sled. A woman standing over the kitchen sink looked out with wide eyes as we passed through her yard and I snapped a wave at her before clawing the handlebar once again to hang on while we tore down her picket fence when Wilson [the lead dog] tried to thread through a hole not much bigger than a housecat. And there is a cocker spaniel who will never come into his backyard again. He heard us coming and turned to bark just as the entire team ran over him; I flipped one of the runners up to just miss his back and we were gone, leaving him standing facing the wrong way barking at whatever it was that had hit him\\" (pg. 145).<br />Much of the first half of the race is a series of such uproarious follies. Unbeknownst to him at the time, the other mushers had voted Paulsen the least likely competitor to get out of Anchorage. But he eventually did, and he ultimately manages to muddle his way through the entire race. As the journey goes on, the book becomes a little more serious as we see Paulsen undergo a transformation. He learns about himself, about the dogs, and about life. He feels himself become one with the frozen world of the north, eventually feeling more at home there that he had with his wife and family in Minnesota.<br />There are sad parts, too. We see a beloved dog trampled to death by a moose before the first day is over. Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon occurence. Moose do not yield the right-of-way to dog teams, and can be extremely dangerous when upset. We also see a maddened musher kill one of his own dogs in a fit of rage. Killing or abusing dogs during the race is strictly prohibited, and the man was duly disqualified, but I still found this the hardest part of the book to read.<br />'Winterdance' is a magnificent story of a man following his dream and gaining a wealth of knowledge about himself and the world. Paulsen's easy, self-deprecating humor and vivid verbal imagery bring the story to life. It is also a fast read - I finished the book in one day. I have rarely read anything that has made me laugh so hard, or that has moved me so much by the end. Growing up in Alaska, I always watched the Iditarod start in Anchorage. I've met some of the winning mushers. But Paulsen's story is entirely unique. He was not a race champion or mushing hero, but the rankest rookie out there. And yet he endears himself to our hearts. For any fan of dog mushing, wilderness survival stories, or both, I recommend this book without hesitation.e so much by the end.

The wolf has long both entranced and terrified humans. It wasn't long ago that most of America harbored an intense wolf-hatred, and it was routine to kill as many of them as possible, as quickly as possible. Ranchers saw the wolf as the ultimate danger to their livestock, and offered bounties to wolf-hunters. Such policies quickly led to the depletion or eradication of entire wolf populations in many parts of the continent. Folk tales like \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" and \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" are evidence of an even more long-standing fear and hatred of the wolf. Wolves are a predator at the top of the food pyramid, just like humans, so they can seem quite threatening, as our \\"niches\\" tend to overlap.<br />More recently, public opinion has seen a dramatic swing in the opposite direction. With the advent of environmentalist groups, the wolf is now seen by many as a symbol of the wild. It is often idolized and viewed as the epitome of nobility. Yet the author of this book asserts that neither this idealized depiction of the wolf, nor the previous view of wolves as bloodthirsty, ruthless killers that should be eradicated at all costs, are accurate perceptions. He states: \\"People used to view wolves imperfectly through filters of greed and fear; they now view them imperfectly through filters of guilt and romance\\" (pg. 31). For instance, wolf advocates have often said that wolves will never attack humans, but this is not entirely accurate. While such incidents are rare, \\"never\\" is not the correct word to use here.<br />Steve Grooms works to dispell the myths that have evolved around the wolf. He begins by describing its history, the stereotypes attached to the wolf, and the long-standing tradition of persecution. It's not a pretty picture. The book offers several very graphic examples of human brutality toward wolves (some are quite disturbing). Grooms goes on to describe the wolf itself and how it lives. He explains the pack system, a wolf's physical traits, what a wolf eats, where they live, etc. The main portion of the book is devoted to the various issues and controversies surrounding wolves today. Unlike other publications, he does not focus on any one particular breed of wolf, or any one particular issue concerning them. Rather, he goes through and describes each of the breeds on the continent - the Red Wolf, the Gray Wolf of the Great Lakes region, the wolves of the Rocky Mountains, the Mexican Wolf, and finally the large Gray Wolf of Alaska. Grooms explains the controversies surrounding wolves in each area, and the various reintroduction programs (some successful and others not) that have made attempts to reestablish the wolf where its numbers have been severely depleted or entirely wiped out. The most notable of these programs are the restoration of the Red Wolf in the southeast, the Mexican Wolf in the southwest, and Gray Wolves in the Great Lakes Region and in Yellowstone.<br />I found Grooms' presentation to be very fair and balanced. He acknowledges the concerns of all human parties, be they ranchers, hunters, or environmentalists. He does not ignore arguments on either side, and validates many on both sides, making corrections when necessary: \\"Because some wolf groups have deified and romanticized the wolf, today it is sometimes as necessary to correct the myths of wolf advocates as the distortions of wolf haters\\" (pg. 183). He obviously admires and respects wolves, but he takes a realistic look at the consequences of sustaining wolf populations in close proximity to humans. When he speaks of environmentalists, he makes two subdivisions - idealists and pragmatists. Idealists tend to see all management (the term being used to mean killing troublesome wolves) of wolf populations as bad. Pragmatists concede there are circumstances where such management may be necessary. He even shows how these two pro-wolf groups have conflicted and sometimes hurt their own cause.<br />As a former Alaska resident, I found Grooms' treatment on wolves in the state to be particularly pleasing. I can say with certainty that he accurately captured the essence of the issue here. Alaska is the only place in the United States where the wolf has not been considered endangered. An estimated 7,000-10,000 wild Gray Wolves make the state their home. Such large numbers have led to a concern opposite that found for wolves in the Lower 48. How can the wolf population in Alaska be effectively kept within an environmentally sustainable limit? Many more radical wolf supporters have expressed outrage at any sort of management program, and even to hunting game animals such as moose. They accuse Alaskans of having \\"sold out\\" to the income generated by leading tourists on guided hunting trips. Having lived there, I know for a fact that most Alaskans have a deep respect for the wolf and most other animals. I was very glad to see that Grooms has accurately represented this outlook: \\"Alaskans typically have a strong attachment to the natural world, but are less sentimental and more utilitarian in their wildlife values than citizens of the Lower 48. . . . [Alaskans] tend to see hunting as a natural, time-honored way of putting meat on the table\\" (pg. 164). Having grown up on wild moose-meat and fish, I can testify that this is true of most Alaskan hunters.<br />At the end, Grooms provides a nice summary, including an overview of well-reputed wolf advocacy groups. He gives a short description of each, as well as providing website addresses for further reference. This is particularly nice since the book, published in 1999, does not have the latest information on the various wolf programs and related disputes that are still ongoing. Furthermore, the book contains an abundance of beautiful photography. There are full-color pictures on almost every page, some of them full-page images. And finally, Grooms' writing style is simple and fluid, making the book accessible to the layman.

Having lived there, I know for a fact that most Alaskans have a deep respect for the wolf and most other animals. I was very glad to see that Grooms has accurately represented this outlook: \\"Alaskans typically have a strong attachment to the natural world, but are less sentimental and more utilitarian in their wildlife values than citizens of the Lower 48. . . . [Alaskans] tend to see hunting as a natural, time-honored way of putting meat on the table\\" (pg. 164). Having grown up on wild moose-meat and fish, I can testify that this is true of most Alaskan hunters.<br />At the end, Grooms provides a nice summary, including an overview of well-reputed wolf advocacy groups. He gives a short description of each, as well as providing website addresses for further reference. This is particularly nice since the book, published in 1999, does not have the latest information on the various wolf programs and related disputes that are still ongoing. Furthermore, the book contains an abundance of beautiful photography. There are full-color pictures on almost every page, some of them full-page images. And finally, Grooms' writing style is simple and fluid, making the book accessible to the layman. The book holds a wealth of good information, and I recommend it most highly.	2004-03-09

'The Decameron' is a fascinating example of classic literature that remains fresh and entertaining today. Written in the mid-14th century, it concerns the first major outbreak of the black plague in Europe, which first emerged in Italy in approximately 1347. Boccaccio begins, in the prologue, by stating his purpose for writing the book - namely, to entertain literate women with nothing else to do with their time. The story itself concerns ten young Florentines (seven women - Pampinea, Filomena, Neifile, Fiammetta, Elissa, Lauretta, and Emilia; and three men - Panfilo, Dioneo, and Filostrato) who flee the city in hopes of escaping the plague. To occupy themselves during this time, they tell each other stories, with each person telling one story per day to make a total of 100 stories over the course of the entire book. At the beginning of the first day, Boccaccio provides an excellent and detailed description of the plague itself. The book ends with the refugees returning to their homes, and a closing epilogue from the author.<br />I very much enjoyed 'The Decameron.' It is interesting and easy to read. The characters in the various stories are ordinary people and this makes them seem very real. Many of them actually are based on real people. Some of the stories, too, are inspired by actual events, though not all. This particular edition is an excellent translation. It is very user-friendly while still retaining the 14th century 'feel' of it. I also liked the organization of the book, as it was always very easy to find a 'stopping place.' With some novels, it's hard to set them down, but since The Decameron is a collection of short stories, one can always stop at the end of any particular story and come back later.<br />Boccaccio claims that his goal in writing 'The Decameron' was to entertain and 'provide succour and diversion' (Prologue 3) to young women who are in love - presumably those whose love lives are not going well at the moment. He says he wishes to 'offer some solace' (Prologue 2) to these women, and also 'some useful advice' (Prologue 3). While this sounds like a noble aim on first glance, I have to wonder about his sincerity. A good many of the stories involve characters who go to rather immoral ends to achieve their aims, and I find it odd that such examples would be given in a book intended to instruct a young lady.<br />Nevertheless, the book is great fun to read. The stories are lively and colorful, and often quite humorous. It provides an excellent insight into the everyday lives of people during this time period. I will caution, however, that most of the stories involve sexuality in some way, and many revolved around it completely. If you are easily offended by bawdy humor, this may not be the book for you. Nearly all the characters of the various tales are sexually active, most with more than one partner. There are also homosexual and bisexual characters. Sexual infidelity is treated here as not only acceptable, but widely encouraged. Characters who cheat on their spouses regularly come out on top, while those that are cuckolded are laughed at and made to look like fools. The unfaithful partner is rewarded and the faithful one shamed and called a prude.<br />The one thing I do wish Boccaccio had talked more about is the ten people who were actually telling the stories. There are hints of Filostrato having a romantic interest in fellow-storyteller Filomena, but this is never followed up on, except to hint that Filomena is herself interested in someone else not of the company. I would like to know if anything more ever came of Filostrato's interest. I would also have liked to know more of what happened to the ten storytellers upon returning to Florence at the end of the book. Had the plague passed? What had happened to those they left behind? Did any of the ten themselves catch the plague? All of this is left out and I found the ending to be somewhat abrupt.<br />Perhaps most unclear to me, however, is how the ten were even able to flee the plague as they did. There is no talk of preparation, and it seems that they just dropped everything and left. The places they stayed were abandoned estates that they simply happened upon. Boccaccio says of the second place they stayed, 'she brought them [. . .] to a most beautiful and ornate palace. [. . .] They explored it from end to end and were filled with admiration for its spacious halls and well-kept, elegant rooms, which were equipped with everything they could possibly need, and they came to the conclusion that only a gentleman of the highest rank could have owned it' (Introduction, Third Day, 189). Why were places such as this abandoned? Had its owner/s died of plague? Or if the owners were not dead but had instead fled from the plague, why did they not take some of their things with them? Why was everything left in these places as if nothing was amiss? It all seems a bit unreal to me.<br />Overall the book is written very well for what it is - a collection of short stories. It is, however, lacking in character development. Most of the storytellers were very flat emotionally, and it would have been nice to see them fleshed out a little more. But in the context of a short story or group of short stories this lack of depth is more forgivable than it would be in a novel. With the exception of Dioneo, who seems to be the most creative and fun-loving of the ten, and Filostrato, who seems absorbed in moping and self-pity for much of the book (presumably over his unrequited interest in Filomena), I found it hard to distinguish one storyteller from another. But the focal point of the book is the stories themselves, and these are all highly entertaining. Though the frequent sexual references may make the book inappropriate for younger audiences, I would highly recommend it for any mature reader.e ten were even able to flee the plague as they did.

One reviewer here, the author of a rather scathing evalutaion, asked that high school students submit their reviews of this book. I'll happily comply (I'm currently a college student, but read 'A World Lit Only By Fire' for the fist time while in high school), though I doubt my review will please her, as I found this book absolutely fascinating, highly enjoyable, and very easy to read. As far as I'm aware, no one else in my AP European History class had trouble with it either.<br />Rather than detailing events in chronological order as many historical books do, Manchester takes us through subject by subject. Beginning with an explanation of the Medieval mind and how it came to be, Manchester goes on to address every possible aspect of life in the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods. In addition to recounting events of historic significance and discussing prominent people of the times, he takes us to the very core of Medieval being, describing in vivid detail the dress, eating habits, beliefs, and living conditions of all classes, from peasantry to nobility. The book closes with a section devoted to the explorer Ferdinand Magellan, telling of his voyage to circumnavigate the globe by which he inadvertantly helped bring about the twilight of an age.<br />There are some things which set this book apart from the bulk of scholarly historical texts I have read. Perhaps the most unique is its organization. Most historical texts begin at one point in time and continue on, year by year, until they reach the end of the period they are covering. Manchester has done things differently. He does not stick to a chronological line in his writing, but rather begins with one aspect of Medieval life and winds his way back and forth through each topic until everything has been told to satisfaction. Now, such a system might prove choppy if not for Manchester's great skill in weaving topics together. The crossover between one subject and the next is sometimes all but imperceptible. He takes one idea and, when finished with it, shows precisely how it ties in with the next. The writing is seamless. Manchester develops a beautiful literary illustration of the interconnectedness of different aspects of Medieval life. As he himself states in his note at the beginning of the book, &quot;each event [leads] inexorably to another, then another...&quot; (pg. XV).<br />The organization and fluency of the writing makes this book easy and pleasurable to read, but there is yet another feature which makes 'A World Lit Only By Fire' special. Manchester's tone brings the author to life. It is plain to see that he has his own opinions on what he is writing, and lets them come through with an easy humor that pokes fun at history's idiosyncrasies without being vicious. While one can see that he has some biases (and everyone does), he covers all aspects of an issue without letting his feelings distort it, but still managing to make his opinion known.<br />It is these characteristics, and a meticulous attention to detail, that separate Manchester's work from the ordinary, cut-and-dried textbook writing we see so often. It draws the reader in just as a novel might. The book is thorough and comprehensive, but the presentation makes it seem almost as if a story is being told. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about life in Medieval Europe.kes one idea and, when finished with it, shows precisely how it ties in with the next.

This 2 x 1.5 inch, 640-page book is absolutely adorable. The editors have taken a slightly different aproach in compiling this dictionary, in the interest of fitting as many helpful definitions as possible into a very tiny space. They have left out a large number of very common words - those that no one could ever reasonably be expected to look up anyway. This way, they have managed to include over 7,000 words that someone might actually need a definition for. The defintions themselves are clear, concise, and to the point. The only downsides to such a small dictionary are that, of course, it still cannot be as far-reaching as a regular, or even a standard pocket-size dictionary, and it would also be very easy to lose. However, as a lover of anything miniature, I consider this to be worth owning for its novelty and cuteness alone.	2004-03-07

This is a fascinating autobiography of one of the most sought-after horse trainers in the world. Monty Roberts takes us from his childhood, growing up on a ranch in California, all the way up through the years right before the book was first published in 1996. He learned to ride at a very young age and was quite successful on the rodeo circuit and in reined cow horse competitions. But what really gave him his ambition to develop a method of communicating with horses was the abuse with which he saw his father treat horses, and the the abuse he himself received from his father. Convinced that there must be a better way to train horses, he observed the behavior of mustangs, and ultimately came up with a technique he calls 'join-up'.<br />'Join-up' involves working with a horse in a round pen, first encouraging the horse to flee around the perimeter by making steady eye contact and assuming an imposing stance. The handler then watches for three tell-tale signs that the horse wishes to communicate - first the horse will lock his inside ear on the handler, then begin licking and chewing, and finally lower his head near the ground as he travels around the pen. Once the horse has given these signals, the handler takes his/her eyes off the horse and shifts away from from the animal. At this point the horse will usually come up behind the handler and stand very close, allowing the handler to touch him. Then the horse can be saddled, bridled, and at last, mounted and ridden. (This is a very truncated explanation - the book goes into much more detail.)<br />Of course Roberts was not the first to use methods like these. Some other reviewers here have complained about this fact, accusing him of taking undue credit. But Roberts himself admits this in his book. He points out that there were trainers in previous centuries that tried (and had success with) similar methods, but that for whatever reason these methods did not take a firm hold on the general equestrian population. So yes, Roberts does do a lot of self-promotion here (another thing some have complained about), but this is because he's attempting to spread the word about his method of training. He is using the book first and foremost to sell his technique, but this is because he wishes to make the training experience a better one for horses.<br />This book takes us through Roberts' journey of learning, and all the trials and triumphs that led him to where he is today. He tells us of his experience with mustangs, his successful childhood riding career, the encounters with his father that helped shape his own way of thinking, the development (and narrowly-avoided disaster) of his Thoroughbred racehorse facility Flag Is Up Farms, various success stories of his 'join-up' method, his meeting with Queen Elizabeth II of England, his many tours to demonstrate his techniques, and even his succes in using 'join-up' with wild deer. He also introduces us to the horses that have shaped his life and carved a place for themselves in his heart - Brownie, his childhood mount; Johnny Tivio, his all-time favorite; and Dually, his most recent mount.<br />Toward the end of the book there is a 'How To' appendix describing in detail the 'join-up' technique. Roberts lists all the necessary equipment (nothing fancy is needed - everything is standard equipment that any horse owner should already have; the only thing you may have to 'borrow' is the round pen itself if you do not have one), and takes us through the procedure in a clear step-by-step fashion. He explains the purpose of each aspect of 'join-up' and how the horse will perceive the handler's actions. He also explains the meaning of the horse's responses to these actions. The appendix is very easy to follow and the technique is simple enough that it is easy to remember afterward, without having to lug the book to the arena with you.<br />The book concludes with an afterword by Lawrence Scanlan, the author of 'Riding High' and co-author (with Ian Millar) of 'Big Ben'. Scanlan describes his experience observing the 'mustang project' that Roberts embarked upon in 1997. This takes us briefly into the story of Shy Boy, a small mustang stallion Roberts attempts to gentle (in the wild, not in a pen) with his 'join-up' technique. The afterword is very short. Roberts went on to write about his experience with Shy Boy in his next book 'Shy Boy: The Horse that Came in from the Wild'. I have not read that one yet, but plan to soon, as I was very impressed with 'The Man Who Listens to Horses'. I would highly recommend it to anyone involved with horses.ar) of 'Big Ben'.

Of all the art technique books I've ever looked at, this has been one of the most useful to me. Graphite is and always has been my favorite medium for drawing, and though I've tried others, I always find myself falling back on the trusty generic pencil. So when I saw this book in the store, I picked it up and thumbed through it and was so impressed by the author's example drawings alone that I bought it. The author is a magnificent artist, and the book has turned out to be a great reference. I've noticed a marked improvement in the realism of my drawings since I started using it.<br />Hillberry begins by introducing us to various materials - graphite pencils, charcoal pencils, carbon pencils, types of erasers, blending tools, types of paper, and other miscellaneous items that can prove helpful - and describes the use and effect of each. He goes on to offer tips on choosing a composition, using light for different effects, using different pencil strokes, blending techniques, layering media, masking, and other helpful methods.<br />The bulk of the book contains instructions on achieving realism when rendering different types of objects: metal, eyes, human hair, glass, broken glass, wood, leather, barbed wire, clothing, and fur. He even offers instructions on little details such as knots in wood, protruding nailheads, etc. At the end he talks about how to put all these methods together into a complete composition, and gives tips on working from photographs. I have not yet tried all of Hillberry's techniques, but the ones I have used have helped me immensely. I would highly recommend this book to any intermediate to advanced level artist.	2004-03-06

This is one of the best albums I've seen for collecting the statehood quarters, and is what I keep my personal collection in. It's simple and yet classy looking. I'm not too keen on those tacky map-like albums. It has ten cardboard pages, with room for two years' worth of quarters (ten) on each page. The coin slots are open on both sides of the page, to allow for viewing of both sides of the coins, and have plastic coverslips to protect against scratches, fingerprints, etc. Each coin slot is labeled with the state's name, and they are arranged in order of production. The book itself is very sturdy and affords ample protection for the coins. The inside cover offers a brief explanation of the &quot;50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act&quot; and some information on quarters in general. The inside back cover lists all the states in order of production, the year in which each was / will be produced, and the date on which that state gained admission to the Union.<br />The only fault I find with this album is that it does not have slots for each mint mark (coins produced at the Philadelphia Mint are marked with a &quot;P&quot; and coins produced at the Denver Mint are marked with a &quot;D&quot; - this can be seen on the reverse side of the coin, to the right of Washington's head, just below the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot;), but this would only be an issue to very serious connoisseurs, and I suspect most casual collectors will be perfectly happy to stick to one coin for each state. Or you could just buy two books, one for Denver coins and one for Philadelphia coins (I know a couple people that have done this). However you choose to go about it, this album is wonderfully put together, and I would recommend it to anyone as a great way to store your Statehood Quarter collection.	2004-03-02

Yorkshire veterinarian James Alfred Wight, better known to his readers as James Herriot, long delighted animal lovers of all ages with his heartwarming stories of his most interesting, inspiring, and sometimes simply mysterious cases. I grew up reading about and falling in love with the dogs, cats, horses, and numerous other animals he treated and immortalized in writing. He had a knack for storytelling that makes his tales lively, engaging, and easy to follow. Many mourned his passing in 1995, at the age of 78.<br />This short collection of stories concerns Herriot's favorite animal, the cat. In his introduction, he reminisces on his choice to become a vet, inspired by his love for cats, and how he soon found that, at the time, there were very few veterinary texts on the species and few veterinarians that practiced on them. Cats were only beginning to be treated as pets and companions rather than simply a replaceable implement to catch barn mice. This, of course, changed over the course of Herriot's career, and though he primarily treated livestock animals he was often called upon to tend to the village's feline population as well.<br />The stories here are some of the cream of the crop of Herriot's writing. First we meet Alfred, the large tom who was a daily fixture in the Yorkshire village's most successful confectionery, and then Oscar, the remarkable cat that attended all manner of meetings and social gatherings in town. Next we are introduced to Boris, an ornery and strong-willed individual who isn't afraid to give Mr. Herriot a piece of his mind.<br />The fourth story brings us to Olly and Ginny, two stray siblings that adopt Herriot and his wife, and actually appear in three of the book's stories. Spaced throughout the book, they actually take on a status as a sort of centerpiece. Undeniably feral, the two are stricly outdoor cats, and it's all Herriot can do to trick them into allowing his occasional veterinary ministations. And they, Olly in particular, clearly express their displeasure. They won't let the well-meaning vet anywhere near them if they can help it. Herriot makes it his mission to win them over, and takes over the job of feeding them every morning in hopes of gaining their trust and respect. He finally manages to befriend Olly, briefly, before tragedy strikes. Happily though, a sad loss leads the vet to share an even closer bond with Olly's sister, Ginny.<br />The other stories concern Emily, the beloved companion of a kindly, solitary man; Moses, a tiny black kitten found among the rushes one icy winter day, and who is ultimately adopted by the strangest of surrogate mothers, a laid-back and accepting sow; Frisk, the cat who has mysterious, recurring, rapidly-developing episodes of coma that vanish almost as quickly as they happen; and finally Buster, the Christmas Day gift from a dying mother who delights his new owner amazing dog-like antics.<br />With ten heatwarming feline tales (or tails, if you prefer), this book is a sure winner for any cat lover. If you're already familiar with Herriot's work, you won't be disappointed (you may even have come across a couple of these stories before), and if he is a new author to you, you may very well go on to seek out his other books. My one teensy-tiny criticism is the the editting could have been just a little bit better. It wouldn't even really be a problem except for the fact that, in one story, a cat is once inexplicably referred to with the wrong name. Other than this the book is perfect. The illustrations are beautiful and the stories delightful. A perfect read for a cozy evening by the fireside.<br />And if you like this, I recommend his other short-story anthologies: &quot;All Thing Bright and Beautiful,&quot; &quot;All Creatures Great and Small,&quot; &quot;All Things Wise and Wonderful,&quot; &quot;The Lord God Made Them All,&quot; and &quot;Every Living Thing&quot; (these titles are based on a poem with the same title as the last book), as well as &quot;James Herriot's Dog Stories.&quot; He also wrote a variety of very nice short children's books.quot;James Herriot's Dog Stories.&quot; He also wrote a variety of very nice short children's books.	2004-03-01

I own the 11th edition of this book, and found it to be an extremely valuable tool while I was searching for potential colleges a few years ago. It lists over 400 four-year colleges and universities throughought the United States (in alphabetical order), and gives helpful information and statistics on each. The profile for each school includes its location, contact information, numbers of full- and part-time students, number of graduates, calendar structure (quarters, semesters, etc.), application deadlines, admissions procedures, the number of applicants versus the number of students accepted, percent of students that earn degrees, student/faculty ratios, tuition fees, room &amp; board expenses, a brief history of the school, its objectives, degrees offered, special programs offered, SAT and/or ACT test score requirements and average student scores, computer and library facilities, and financial aid information. It is, of course, important to double-check the provided information with the particular schools you are interested in, as many of these things change from year to year.<br />Each school is also ranked as most competitive, highly competitive, very competitive, competitive, less competitive, or noncompetitive, to give you an idea of how hard it may be to get in. All the schools are also indexed by state at the back, making it easy to look for colleges in particular areas. This book is only intended to help you discover colleges that may fit your goals and needs, and to provide a handy reference to school statistics, and is certainly not the only source you should reference. Once you have a list of schools that interest you, the next step will be to contact those institutions for further, more detailed information. I also strongly recommend visiting the campuses of any schools that interest you. This book is, however, a great place to start looking. It is likely that you will come across options you hadn't been aware of before. The book is also relatively small (standard dimensions of most paperback fiction books, for example) and lightweight, making it easy to transport if need be. Overall I couldn't recommend it more highly, and I wish you good luck on your search for the perfect school!ll (standard dimensions of most paperback fiction books, for example) and lightweight, making it easy to transport if need be.

It's simply not a college level text. While it is very user-friendly, the material it covers is all stuff a student should have learned long before college. Things like how to write a thesis statement, organize a paper, use libraries and the Internet, evaluate sources for quality, take notes, incorporate quotes into a paper, avoid plagiarism, properly cite sources, use appropriate word choice and sentence variety, and the standards of proper English conventions should all have been taught in middle school / junior high. At this level, the book has been largely useless to me, as it only covers things I already know. The exercises, too, are redundant of little help.<br />This book would, however, be an excellent text to use in middle school, or even high school. The skills Ballenger teaches here are important, but they should be taught much earlier than college. The format is easy to read, and much less intimidating than many other such books. It's not at all \\"dry\\" like so many texts. Ballenger makes frequent use of nice analogies to help the reader understand how certain elements of a paper will help it or harm it. He also gives examples from his students' own papers, which can be very useful. Included in the book are references to valuable Internet research sites, and appendices that cover proper MLA and APA citations. If used earlier in school, this book would be a valuable resource.	2004-02-28

The Arabian is certainly a well-established breed that has existed for a long time, but it is not the \\"oldest\\" in any sense of the word.<br />\\"The Camargue is said to resemble the horses found drawn on the cave walls of Lascaux\\" (pg. 44/45): Has the author ever SEEN the cave paintings at Lascaux? I would hardly say they look like Camargues. The conformation and coloring of the horses in the paintings much more closely resembles something like the Mongolian Wild (a.k.a. Przewalski's) Horse. And THOSE look nothing like Camargues.<br />\\"Though the name refers to a color and not strictly a breed, the palomino has nonetheless attained virtual breed status in the U.S.\\" (pg. 55): No, not even close. There is a registry for palomino-colored horses, yes, but they'll register anything from a Shetland to a Quarter Horse to a completely mixed grade-horse. There is no palomino breed.<br />\\"On the North American continent, it is generally believed that the horse played a major role in enabling Native Americans to become mobile and cover great distances for trade or aggression. Yet, years later, it was the horse that was employed by the cavalry to conquer the Indian forces\\" (pg. 80): He's got it completely backward here. Horses vanished from North America in prehistoric times, and it was not until Europeans arrived on the continent that horses were reintroduced. So there is no way the Native Americans could have had horses BEFORE the Europeans arrived.<br />\\"The polo pony is not truly a breed, but an Argentinian strain that comes close to attaining breed status\\" (pg. 108): The author seems love inventing \\"breeds.\\" The term \\"polo pony\\" simply refers to ANY horse used in the game of polo. There is no breed or near-breed. Indeed, many polo ponies are small Thoroughbreds.<br />\\"Challenging a pony to a foot race is good fun, too, but one should be a good sport and allow the horse to win from time to time\\" (pg. 131): It would have to be one HECK of a small, slow pony if it needed to be \\"allowed\\" to win. A healthy horse or pony can very easily outrun any human.breed, but an Argentinian strain that comes close to attaining breed status\\" (pg. 108): The author seems love inventing \\"breeds.\\" The term \\"polo pony\\" simply refers to ANY horse used in the game of polo.

It covers (briefly) a variety of topics relating to the horse, but does not, of course, give any in-depth or scholarly information. It's intended as a novelty item and takes on more of a &quot;random fun facts&quot; format. Topics covered are the evolution of the horse, Genghis Khan, horses in America, the Pony Express, quotations, famous horses (Bucephalus, Babieca, Man O'War, and Secretariat), &quot;popular breeds&quot; (Chingoteague Pony, Morgan, and Clydsedale), characteristics of the horse, sports (dressage and racing), and a section of interesting facts. I was a little disappointed to see some factual errors, such as citing Justin Morgan as the founding horse of the Morgan breed (Justin Morgan was the owner, Figure was the horse), but this is a common error and of course the book is just for fun. The text is accompanied by some very nice illustrations, many of them historical paintings, and also a few photographs, though all of these are naturally quite tiny. I found this tiny book to be quite a delight, and it would make a great gift for any horse lover.	2004-02-27

So even though I've never put a whole lot of stock in astrology, I couldn't resist picking up one of these little 2 x 2 1/4 inch books just for kicks. It's incredibly cute, and beautifully illustrated. It begins with a brief introduction to the history of astrology, followed by descriptions of Aries' personality, associated symbols, physical and mental features, home and family life, career tendencies, and common liesure activities. The second half of the book is devoted to love life, and provides an analysis of Aries' compatibility with each other sign (and with other Arians). However, at least 75% of what the book said was wildly innaccurate in regards to myself, and the rest was so vaguely worded that it could be applied to just about anyone. But it's inexpensive, and it's tiny, and it's cute, so it still makes a nice, light-hearted gift for yourself or a friend.	2004-02-25

This is a very valuable study tool to use in preparation for the AP European History examination, but it needs to be used correctly to be effective! Reading through some of the previous reviews, I fear that the problems some students have noted may not be the fault of the book, but rather of their own study habits. Trying to read the entire book a week or two before the test will NOT work. The material is extremely concentrated and covers more than 400 years of history. Trying to absorb it all in a couple of weeks will do nothing more than mix you up hopelessly and almost guarantee a poor score.<br />Pacing yourself is the KEY to success here. Buy the book as close to the beginning of the school year as you can, and follow along throughout the year. Highlight and take notes where needed. Then, as the test date approaches (i.e. 1-2 months ahead of time), start a more rigorous program. Re-read the material you've already gone over. Then take the practice tests. Over and over and over. Until you can consistently answer almost all of the questions on all of the practice tests correctly. It may seem like overkill, but it's worth it. After each time you take a practice test, check your answers, AND read the detailed explanations given for the answers that you got wrong. These explanations are invaluable.<br />Of further use are the sample DBQ and essay questions given in the book. It's up to you how far you want to go with these. I found that actually writing out an entire essay wasn't necessary. But I would suggest at least compiling an outline for each question, to ensure that you have enough information to provide a good answer. If you find yourself only able to put together a skimpy outline, then read up on the subject and try again.<br />True, only a very small portion of the material covered in the book will actually show up on the test, but you have no way of knowing WHAT portion. This book compiles sample questions from numerous past examinations. There is a LOT of information here. But as my teacher pointed out (and I'm inclined to agree), it's rather like training for a marathon with weights on your legs. You'll get really good at running with weights, and then when you take them off for the actual race, it will seem super easy! I found that to be very true when I took the test after studying with this book.<br />Another handy feature of this edition is that it comes with software that can be used with either Windows or Macintosh. This way you can take the same practice tests on your computer, if you prefer that to studying by hand. It's also easier to check your answers this way, rather than flipping back and forth through the book. AND the software times your tests for you, so you can make sure you're able to cover all the material within the time slot you'll be allowed on the actual test. Overall, this is a great study tool, and should help you immensely if you take it seriously. Good luck!f information here.

This book, compiled by a panel of seven from The Blood-Horse, provides an excellent run-down on 100 of the greatest horses to grace the Thoroughbred racing scene in America during the 1900s. Each horse is honored with a brief biography (the top 20 horses get four pages each, and all the rest get two) that describes his/her history, racing career, and any notable offspring or other key accomplishments in clear and easy-to-read language. In addition, a race record, pedigree, and one or two nice photographs of each is provided.<br />At the back of the book one will find a few more helpful resources. A table of the chosen 100 provides a nice quick-reference to year of birth, owner, breeder, and trainer. There is also a \\"Leaders List\\" with interesting statistics, including horses with the most wins, unbeaten horses, once-beatens, horses with the most starts, Kentucky Derby (and Triple Crown) winners, multimillionaires, geldings, top trainers, top breeders, and the foaling years that produced the most champions.<br />The 100 horses included are ranked as follows:<br />(1) Man O'War; (2) Secretariat; (3) Citation; (4) Kelso; (5) Count Fleet; (6) Dr. Fager; (7) Native Dancer; (8) Forego; (9) Seattle Slew; (10) Spectacular Bid; (11) Tom Fool; (12) Affirmed; (13) War Admiral; (14) Buckpasser; (15) Colin; (16) Damascus; (17) Round Table; (18) Cigar; (19) Bold Ruler; (20) Swaps; (21) Equipoise; (22) Phar Lap; (23) John Henry; (24) Nashua; (25) Seabiscuit; (26) Whirlaway; (27) Alydar; (28) Gallant Fox; (29) Exterminator; (30) Sysonby; (31) Sunday Silence; (32) Skip Away; (33) Assault; (34) Easy Goer; (35) Ruffian; (36) Gallant Man; (37) Discovery; (38) Challedon; (39) Armed; (40) Busher; (41) Stymie; (42) Alysheba; (43) Northern Dancer; (44) Ack Ack; (45) Gallorette; (46) Majestic Prince; (47) Coaltown; (48) Personal Ensign; (49) Sir Barton; (50) Dahlia; (51) Susan's Girl; (52) Twenty Grand; (53) Sword Dancer; (54) Grey Lag; (55) Devil Diver; (56) Zev; (57) Riva Ridge; (58) Slew o' Gold; (59) Twilight Tear; (60) Native Diver; (61) Omaha; (62) Cicada; (63) Silver Charm; (64) Holy Bull; (65) Alsab; (66) Top Flight; (67) Arts and Letters; (68) All Along; (69) Noor; (70) Shuvee; (71) Regret; (72) Go For Wand; (73) Johnstown; (74) Bald Eagle; (75) Hill Prince; (76) Lady's Secret; (77) Two Lea; (78) Eight Thirty; (79) Gallant Bloom; (80) Ta Wee; (81) Affectionately; (82) Miesque; (83) Carry Back; (84) Bimelech; (85) Lure; (86) Fort Marcy; (87) Gamely; (88) Old Rosebud; (89) Bewitch; (90) Davona Dale; (91) Genuine Risk; (92) Sarazen; (93) Sun Beau; (94) Artful; (95) Bayakoa; (96) Exceller; (97) Foolish Pleasure; (98) Beldame; (99) Roamer; (100) Blue Larkspur<br />Of course there will be debate over the rankings. The top three - Man O'War, Secretariat, and Citation (rated in that order) - in particular will fuel heated and unending dispute. But one must take into account that these horses raced in different times, under different conditions. Track surfaces, weight carried, equipment used, living conditions, diet, training methods, quality of the competition, types of races entered, and more all varied greatly. Some were dirt horses and some turf horses. Some were sprinters and some ran longer distances. Some were pacesetters and some were come-from-behind horses. The only way to know for sure which ones were better than others would be to line them all up and race them against each other. But we can't do that. So the rankings given here should be taken rather lightly, and not be the focal point of the book. Rather, it is a nice, concise overview of a group of 100 very good racehorses, and that is all it should be taken for.<br />The book is not a completely comprehensive reference - those looking for in-depth information on one particular horse would need to read additional sources, as the biographies here are just very brief overviews squeezed into a couple pages - but it makes for interesting reading and the statistics and pedigrees given can bequite useful. On the whole I would highly recommend this to any Thoroughbred racing enthusiast.quite useful. On the whole I would highly recommend this to any Thoroughbred racing enthusiast.	2004-02-22

Price must have done a phenomenal amount of work compiling this wonderful collection of more than 300 pages of horse-related quotes. The selected quotations cover all imaginable aspects of the horse world, and are divided into eight categories: Horses in Literature, Riding and Training, Out of the West, A Shakespearean Interlude, Racing - The Sport of Kings, A Pack of Hunting Quotations, Horse Laughs, and Horse Truths. Length varies from simple one-liners to several paragraphs or entire poems.<br />Included among those people quoted are such notables as Rudyard Kipling, Leon Trotsky, Benjamin Franklin, Dante, Virgil, Walt Whitman, Geoffrey Chaucer, Charles Dickens, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, J.D. Salinger, Francois Rabelais, Alfred Lord Tennyson, William Blake, John Milton, Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, Marco Polo, Homer, George Eliot, Walter Farley, Plato, Robert Louis Stevenson, John Steinbeck, Herman Melville, Sir Winston Churchill, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Sigmund Freud, Roy Rogers, Meriwether Lewis, William Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway, Edgar Degas, Oscar Wilde, Marguerite Henry, John Adams, Xenophon, Martin Luther, Mao Tse-Tung, Nikita Kruschev, Napoleon Bonaparte, and many others; some are also taken from texts such as Aesop's Fables, The Bible, The Koran, and the Psalms. Also included are renowned horsemen and horsewomen William Steinkraus, John Lyons, Linda Tellington-Jones, Mary Wanless, Reiner Klimke, Sally Swift, Anne Kursinski, and Monty Roberts. The editor even stuck one of his own in with &quot;One man's wrong lead is another man's counter-canter&quot; (pg. 269).<br />This would be a terrific coffee-table book, quick-reference for finding all manner of horse quotes, or gift idea for a horse-crazed friend. An index in the back makes looking up quotes by a particular author very easy, and biographical notes provide helpful information on the authors. My only criticism is that I'd like to see short explanations for some of the more obscure quotes that use antiquated terms or expressions that aren't always familiar to people of today. Other than that, this is a wonderful compilation that I would highly recommend.re obscure quotes that use antiquated terms or expressions that aren't always familiar to people of today.

If you are at all familiar with equine photography, you will no doubt have heard of Denver Bryan. His photographs grace numerous magazines, calendars, and books. This is a fine collection of his work, showing the many sides of horses and celebrating the equine spirit. The book is divided in to four sections - Portraits (showing horses at rest and play), Living With Horses (showing the interactions between horses, humans, and other animals), Working Horses (showing ranch and pack horses at work), and The Competitive Horse (showing both English and Western showhorses, racehorses, and rodeo horses). The full-color photographs are large, clear, and attractive. Some capture a special moment, an emotion, or sometimes simply a priceless facial expression.<br />I was a little less impressed with the text of the book. Interspersed among the photographs are short blurbs that read somewhat like flowery poetry and seem a bit superflous. However, the central element of the book is the photography, and the text does not detract from it or overpower it. I was, however, diappointed to see &quot;Palominos&quot; touted as a breed in the Introduction. This is a common error and I always shake my head when I see it perpetuated. Palomino is just a color - one which is found in numerous breeds - and not a breed in and of itself. But this is a small quibble and I won't get carried away. The book is, on the whole, very nice. It should do well as a coffee-table type book, and many of the pictures would make good artistic inspiration and reference material. This is a great idea either as a gift or a treat for yourself.	2004-02-20

Joe Redington, Sr., may not have been an Alaskan by birth, but any resident of the state would agree that he was, and remains, a symbol of the Alaskan spirit. Born and raised in Oklahoma, Redington always had a fascination with the rugged far-north, and read every book on Alaska he could get his hands on. In 1948, at the age of 31, he finally made the decision to pack up his family and move there. They homesteaded in Knik, off the Parks Highway, on the northwestern side of Knik Arm, and that's how Redington got involved with sled dogs. Mushing was an effective way to get from place to place, and Knik Kennels was born. By chance, the property opened directly onto the historic Iditarod trail, which by that time was in poor shape owing to disuse. Redington cleared a section of the trail for his own use, and soon became caught up in the route's historical significance. The famed 1925 \\"Serum Run\\" had followed that trail when there was no other means of rushing life-saving medication to diptheria-stricken Nome.<br />Redington decided it was high time the trail be restored and brought back into regular use, proposing a 1,000-mile dogsled race from Anchorage to Nome. Everyone thought he was nuts. But the first Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race was held in March of 1973, on a shoestring budget, but a resounding success nonetheless. The first few years of the race's existence were rocky at best, but this was Redington's baby, and he nursed it along with unwaivering confidence and energy. Today it is an internationally famous sporting event, with mushers arriving each spring from all over the globe to compete. Though Redington himself never won the race (he participated in it almost every year), not having time enough left to properly train his dogs after all the effort he expended in organization of the event, he did help many eventual Iditarod champions get their footing. Two such notable figures are five-time winner Rick Swenson and four-time winner Susan Butcher. In addition, Redington, along with Susan Butcher and Ray Genet, brought the first dog team to the peak of Mount McKinley in 1979. In 1993 he organized the first Iditarod Challenge, an opportunity to follow the trail for fun rather than competition, with Redington as guide. He also participated in a special dogsledding trial at the 1994 Olympics in Norway.<br />The title \\"Father of the Iditarod\\" has been applied to Joe Redington for years, and he has engraven himself upon the hearts of all Alaskans. I grew up in Anchorage and he was always a household name. He was an amazing man. Redington had unquenchable enthusiasm for everything he did, and never let age slow him down. He ran his last Iditarod in 1997, at the age of 80. When he was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus in 1998, he fought it with the same determination and confidence that he had exhibited when fighting for the creation of the Iditarod, and he beat it. He even got back to mushing, though he would not compete again, and eventually the cancer returned and claimed his life in 1999.<br />This book does every possible justice to the pioneering man who revived dogsled mushing as a popular competitive sport. It is a delightful read, descriptive and engaging. Even a reader not familiar with Alaska or dog mushing will be able to capture the essence of it here. The book is also filled with great black-and-white photos of Redington, his family and fellow mushers, his dogs, and other images that bring the story to life. My one criticism would be a lack of sufficient editting. There are a few too many typos that should have been caught, and hence I don't feel quite right about giving an unconditional five-star rating. It also appears as if the very end of Chapter 18 may have been cut off, as it leaves off with what appears to be the beginning of a new sentence, but when the reader flips to the next page, it is the beginning of the next chapter. Other than this, however, the book flows very nicely and is easy to read. I wouldhighly recommend it to just about anyone, Alaskan or not, and regardless of experience with dogs or mushing. A thoroughly delightful book!highly recommend it to just about anyone, Alaskan or not, and regardless of experience with dogs or mushing. A thoroughly delightful book!	2004-02-19

I really liked The Horse Whisperer, and loved The Loop, but The Smoke Jumper falls well short of both. The story begins with two best friends, Ed Tully and Connor Ford, who spend their summers &quot;smoke jumping&quot; - that is, parachuting into remote locations to fight forest fires. Then Ed falls in love with the beautiful Julia Bishop. Their relationship is perfect until he introduces her to Connor, and girlfriend and best friend find themselves fighting an intense attraction to each other, which mortifies them both in light of their love and respect for Ed. Julia spends the summer as a counselor in a rehab program for delinquent teens, taking them camping in the mountains in hopes of recovering their lost souls. Disaster strikes when a forest fire claims the life of one teenager, badly scathes and blinds Ed, and leaves Julia consumed with feelings of guilt over them both.<br />Here the story takes an abrupt change in direction. Julia, overwhelmed by feelings of obligation, helps Ed adjust to life without sight, and ultimately marries him. Connor, unable to bear seeing the woman he loves married to another man, takes off to begin a new career as a photojournalist in the various war-torn countries of the world, returning from time to time for brief visits. When Julia and Ed are unable to have a child due to Ed's apparent sterility, they convince Connor to father a child for them. Shortly thereafter Connor departs for good, thrown into despair at the realization that he is now severed not only from Julia, but also from a daughter that is not his. It is only after Ed's eventual death that Julia can embark upon a journey of her own and allow herself the hope that perhaps she and Connor might be united at last.<br />If the above synopsis of the story seems a bit disjointed, that should give you an idea of how the book itself runs. Evans has created a hodgepodge of settings, plotlines, and themes that undermine the significance of the title. Less than half of the book actually deals with smoke jumping (and even here it is not the primary object of the story), with the theme only recurring briefly at the very end, under entirely different circumstances. Perhaps it would be more descriptive to say that Evans &quot;dabbles&quot; with themes. He dabbles with smoke jumping, he dabbles with delinquent teenagers, he dabbles with music, he dabbles with blindness, he dabbles with photography, and he dabbles with various wartorn places such as Bosnia and parts of Africa. None of them really has anything to do with the central love triangle, and seem tacked-on and interchangeable. In the second part of the book, each time we see Connor, he is in a new place, in the middle of a different war or conflict. We get bits and pieces of the various stories, but the reader is left at best indifferent and at worst downright confused due to the lack of groundwork for the scenes. We are simply plopped down in one place for a short while, then snatched right back up, never to return. There is not enough devlopment for us to truly understand or even to care what is going on in each of the places Connor finds himself.<br />Another problem, partly stemming from the above and partly due to the writing style, is that the story seems very unrealistic. One can't really imagine all of this happening in real life. The interaction between characters frequently seems affected and unbelievable. The dialogue is often unnatural. In particular, the speech and mannerisms of the teenagers in Julia's program, and later of her own 8-year-old daughter Amy, do not reflect the actual patterns of speech and behavior of children in those age groups. Adding to the sense of falsity is Evans's frequent use of cliche ideas and phrases such as &quot;I've loved you from the first moment I saw you,&quot; and &quot;he woke with a start and for a moment couldn't figure out where he was.&quot; Such declarations and images have been so overused that one can only groan at coming across them yet again.<br />I was also horrified by the scene in which a young African soldier is made to publicly appologize to a girl he raped in front of all their peers. In real life such a display would be utterly humiliating to the victimized girl, especially considering that she had told no one about the incident. And yet the girl in the story seems absolutely fine with the arrangement.<br />There are also a few factual errors in the book which, while relatively insignificant, still disappointed me slightly. For example, Amy has curly hair, while both her parents - Julia and Connor - have straight hair. Curly hair is a dominant trait in humans, so if a person carries the gene for curly hair, they will HAVE curly hair. Therefore, neither Julia nor Connor could have carried the curly hair gene, since both have straight hair, and so there is no way Amy could have inherited a curly hair gene from either one.<br />So far I've only expounded on the faults I've found with the book, but I must say it's certainly not among the worst I've ever read. While not entirely engaging, it is moderately entertaining and very easy to read. For a reader less nit-picky than myself, the storyline may even be enjoyable. It's the kind of book to take with you to a doctor's office waiting room or similar situations, where you aren't inclined to read something &quot;heavy&quot; and yet still need to pass the time. Overall though, I wouldn't highly recommend it. It just doesn't live up to Evans's potential, and I'm sure you can find numerous more worthwhile alternatives in recreational reading material.en so overused that one can only groan at coming across them yet again.<br />I was also horrified by the scene in which a young African soldier is made to publicly appologize to a girl he raped in front of all their peers.

The first 130 pages are rather like going through a very dense textbook - there are too many names, places, and events crammed into too tight of a framework, allowing for little or no character development. Because of this it can be rather hard to get into the earlier stories, and even harder to retain the information afterward. After about 80 pages I was sincerely beginning to reconsider my decision to read the book, but I'll tell those who may be having similar problems - keep going! It does get better, I promise.<br /><br />The Silmarillion begins with a shorter sub-book, the Ainulindalë, which is the Creation story of Middle-Earth. It tells how Eru, or Il&uacute;vatar, the god of Tolkien's mythology, created the Ainur, holy beings who shape the world through their song. The Ainulindalë goes on to speak of the Ainur who went to dwell in Arda, the earth, and became known as the Valar; the two races created by Il&uacute;vatar to inhabit Arda - the immortal Firstborn (Elves), and the mortal Followers (Men); and also of how the first evil came to be, as the Ainu known as Melkor and later Morgoth challenges the will of Il&uacute;vatar and falls out of favor, eventually to become the first Dark Lord of Middle-Earth.<br /><br />Next is the Valaquenta, a short section which defines and describes the Valar, the Maiar (the slightly lesser \\"servants and helpers\\" of the Valar), and the Enemies (namely Melkor and those he manipulates to do his will).<br /><br />The main body of The Silmarillion, the \\"Quenta Silmarillion,\\" is the history of the Silmarils, sacred jewels created by the elf Fëanor, and all the events that take place around them. It is divided into chapters which take the form of short stories. As I mentioned earlier, the first several of these can be rather difficult to wade through - the abundance of character and place names alone will throw the reader for a loop. These early stories cover topics such as the shaping of the world by the Valar, the coming of the Elves into Middle-earth, the creation and loss of the Silmarils, the unleashing of the evil of Melkor, the rebellion of the Elves against the Valar, and the general layout of Middle-earth at that time.<br /><br />If after this the reader is a bit overwhelmed, don't despair! I found that, beginning with Chapter 16 \\"Of Maeglin\\" which begins on page 131, the stories really begin to pick up. From here on the tales are easier to follow and the characters are more fully developed and easy to identify with. Subsequent chapters deal with the coming of Men into Middle-earth and their migration westward, the continued malice of Melkor and the battles between his followers and the Elves and Men that remain good, the famous love story of Beren and L&uacute;thien (the first joining of man and elf), the tragic life of T&uacute;rin Turambar, the ruin of the realm of Doriath, the eventual overthrow of Morgoth, and of how the Silmarils came to their final resting places in the earth, the sea, and the sky.<br /><br />Following the main body of the text are two more sub-books, the first of which is the Akallabêth, which tells the story of the N&uacute;men&oacute;reans, the race of men that dwelt on the island of N&uacute;men&oacute;r, closest to the sacred realm of Valinor in the far west. Ultimately the temptation to seek out Valinor overcomes them, and in punishment a rift is opened in the sea, swallowing N&uacute;men&oacute;r and forever cleaving Middle-earth and Valinor apart. A few of the N&uacute;men&oacute;reans survive and dwell in Middle-earth, and from these is descended Aragorn, who appears in The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />The final section of the book is entitled \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age,\\" and concerns just that. It speaks of the rise of Sauron, who had been Morgoth's primary servant and ally, and who comes into power of his own following Morgoth's downfall. The book provides a brief overview of the battles between Sauron and the peoples of Middle-earth, which come to a temporary halt when Isildur cuts the One Ring from Sauron's hand. The events thereafter are picked up in the stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />This second edition of The Silmarillion includes at its beginning a letter written by author J.R.R. Tolkien to good friend Milton Waldman in 1951. I found the letter very interesting, as it provides a nice overview of the material covered in the book, tying it all together in condensed form and helping to provide a framework that holds the stories together as the reader goes along. At the end of the book are supplementary materials that are equally valuable, including lineage tables of the key characters, a brief treatise on pronunciation, and an extensive index that also serves as a useful dictionary of names, places, and other Middle-earth terms. At the very end there is a map of Middle-earth as it looked at the time of these stories.<br /><br />The Silmarillion is not what I would call an easy read, but for an attentive and interested reader, it should not be overwhelmingly difficult either. The information within provides a very detailed background for the events of Tolkien's most famous work, The Lord of the Rings. Some of the stories in The Silmarillion are excellent, self-standing short tales even without benefit of the rest of the history, and could probably have made very engaging books in and of themselves had Tolkien decided to develop them to that extent. Overall I would highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn more of the history of Middle-earth, though I strongly suggest finishing both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings beforehand.dur cuts the One Ring from Sauron's hand.

US	46057280	R706PT4DWG26D	0553212583	363093333	Wuthering Heights (Bantam Classics)	Books	3	18	22	N	N	Well-written and deeply disturbing, but illogical in plot.	I picked up a copy of Emily Brontë's classic after being very much impressed with her sister Charlotte Brontë's novel Jane Eyre. However, while I did find much to be meritted in Wuthering Heights, I also feel that it fell short of my hopes. The story initially focuses on the lives of Catherine and Heathcliff, childhood sweethearts forced apart by their families. Catherine marries another man, vainly thinking she can love and be loved by both Heathcliff and her husband Edgar at the same time. As an act of revenge, Heathcliff married Edgar's sister Isabella. What ensues is a dark and stormy emotional battle between many very troubled people.<br /><br />Catherine dies halfway through the novel, starving herself to insanity and death when she realizes that the two men in her life will not share her and instead demand that she make a choice. She leaves behind her a daughter of the same name, young Catherine. Heathcliff and Isabella in turn produce a son, the weak and sickly Linton. The remainder of the novel concerns the love affair that develops between Linton and young Catherine, and Heathcliff's violent, vengeful manipulation of their lives.<br /><br />I thought the book was very well written (as it ought to be, to have achieved a rank among classic literature), and I was able to read it with no trouble. Some of the words and terms are a bit antiquated, but someone familiar with works of the time should not find these too daunting. Though keeping a dictionary close at hand is a surefire way to avoid trouble. Brontë has excellent word choice and creates very vivid imagery. My one criticism of the writing itself regards the manner in which Brontë has chosen to express dialects. The Yorkshire accent of Heathcliff's servant Joseph (and later of young Catherine's cousin Hareton) is nearly impossible to read, with phrases like \\"ut's soa up uh going\\" intended to mean \\"who is set on going\\". My copy of the book has an appendix that \\"translates\\" the most incomprehensible of his words, but it is a great irritation to constantly flip to the back (sometimes several times per paragraph) for explanation, and even the notes there do not decipher everything.<br /><br />The found the story itself to be profoundly disturbing. Wuthering Heights undoubtedly contains one of the largest collections of mentally unbalanced characters I've ever come across in any novel. It is choc full of sadists, masochists, and otherwise troubled and violent personalities. The whole book has a very dark, opressive feel about it, and there were times I found it downright unsettling. I must tip my figurative hat to Brontë for her skill in creating atmosphere and invoking feeling in her readers.<br /><br />However, the storyline is a bit weak in my estimation, as the characters' feelings about and behavior toward each other is often quite illogical. The different culture of the time can explain some of this, but there remains, I believe, a general unrealistic quality about the plot. Why, for instance, would Catherine and Heathcliff have ever fallen in love in the first place? Their childhood attraction is easy to explain as the passing fancies of the very young, but their relationship as adults is more troubling. Heathcliff is moody, egocentric, obsessive, and extremely violent; Catherine is vain and naive, narcissistic, and given to wild emotional tantrums when she does not get her way. What would posses anyone to fall for either of the two? Even harder to understand is the timid Edgar's proposal to Catherine. She abuses him repeatedly, mentally and physically, and yet he claims to love her. Why?<br /><br />The next generation of characters is equally unbalanced and ill-matched. I think young Catherine is probably the only main character with some claim on a sound mind, though even she is not without issues. Though she is intelligent and generally strong-minded, she is for some reason a complete pushover when it comes to the frail, sniveling Linton's outbursts of self-pity. Even when Catherine herself recognizes Linton's problems and appears to have lost her romantic interest in him, she still obeys his every whining command when there is no incentive whatsoever for her to do so. Heathcliff is even more violent in the second part of the novel than the first. He physically abuses nearly all who cross his path, including his own son, taking his only pleasure from the misery of others. Another relationship that raises questions in my mind is Catherine's attraction to young Hareton following Linton's death. Catherine has been brought up as a proper young lady with manners and education, and Hareton is a slovenly, shadowy figure whose speech is as difficult to comprehend as the servant Joseph's. The two young people seem to have absolutely nothing in common.<br /><br />On the whole, I recognize the literary merits of Wuthering Heights - as I said it is very well written and invokes strong reactions in the reader. The character development is excellent, even if those characters are mentally and emotionally unbalanced in the extreme. The book explores the themes of love, jealousy, and obsession, and provokes thought. However, it is by no means a feel-good book and I can't say I'd recommend it for recreational reading. This one is probably best left in the academic discussion circles and not brought home to read before bedtime.ty.

First off, I must say that I really did enjoy reading this book. I am not a World War II buff, and had previously known almost nothing about the AAF's role in the war except that they existed. Here Ambrose follows the 15th Army Air Force, based in Cerignola, Italy, through the years 1944 and 1945. The book is easy to read and requires little or no previous knowledge of the AAF or its planes to understand. Ambrose explains the history behind the 15th, the B-24 &quot;Liberator&quot; (and touches on the smaller B-17 &quot;Flying Fortress&quot;) bombers, and the men who made up the flight crews. He also discusses the structure and mechanics of the B-24, and the tactics relating to strategic bombing. There is, however, room for improvement.<br />The book is largely centered on George McGovern's experiences in the war, as a B-24 pilot, and I would have liked to read more about the other pilots, co-pilots, and flight crew members. Ambrose mentions a plethora of other men, but merely skims most of them. The reader does not really get to know most of the characters, as they did in Band of Brothers (Ambrose's work concerning the 101st Airborne division, which I consider to be a better book).<br />I also wish Ambrose had gone into more detail overall. As some other reviewers have commented, the book does seem a bit rushed. Perhaps this stems from the fact that the concept for the book was not originally his - Ambrose picked up the project, on the recommendation of George McGovern, from another author who had already started it. Again to compare with Band of Brothers, I did not feel, when I finished this book, that I had as in-depth a knowledge about the AAF as I gained about the 101st Airborne. And while I have certainly gained respect for the B-24 bomber pilots and their crews, I did not come away with the overwhelming feeling of awe and admiration that I did for the paratroopers of E-Company in Band of Brothers.<br />I was also disappointed to see a lack of good editting. There are numerous typos throughout the text that should have been caught and corrected before publication. This bogs down the text in some places, as the reader takes a few moments to realize that &quot;so&quot; is supposed to be &quot;do&quot; and so on. The book is certainly not worthless - as I said I did learn from and enjoy it - but does leave something to be desired. It would probably be best recommended to casual World War II readers, like myself, and not to true scholars and history buffs, who I'm sure could find more useful references elsewhere.ere are numerous typos throughout the text that should have been caught and corrected before publication.

US	46057280	R1JW96AIQGVBLO	0806524502	353826346	The Perfect Ride	Books	5	35	37	N	N	The Perfect Ride: a perfect read for racing fans!	I have long held a great measure of respect for Gary Stevens as a professional racehorse jockey. I've watched him ride some great races on television (having grown up in an area with almost no horse industry at all, I have not had the fortune to see one of his races live). My respect for the man only grew when I saw the movie Seabiscuit (where he plays jockey George Woolf, who rode Seabiscuit in his famous match race with rival War Admiral) and realized he had a bit of acting talent as well. So when I saw his autobiography in the store, I snatched it up right away and am certainly glad I did. Reading it, my estimation of this great athlete went even higher.<br />Stevens begins with his early childhood, living in Idaho. His father worked with Appaloosas, then moved on to Quarter Horse racing, and later to Thoroughbreds. Gary's older brother Scott began a career as a jockey, and Gary soon followed in his footsteps. He was riding Quarter Horses in races (under Scott's name) before he was legally old enough to obtain a jockey's license. The boy fell in love with the sport, and soon made the switch to riding Thoroughbreds. At seventeen, he left home for California, rode a dismal season, and returned to Idaho. There he got married, and over the next few years his career began to take flight and the book describes all his significant wins, losses, and other experiences.<br />Though his career soared over the years, Stevens talks of his constant battle with pain. A series of riding accidents over the years left him with terrible knees, requiring frequent surgery. He endured many breaks from riding in order to undergo rehabilitation, and often returned to the track prematurely, riding despite the pain. He even retired for a short time and tried his hand at training, but found he just couldn't stay away from riding. Stevens' frank discussion of his pain is one of the most inspiring things I've ever read. No matter how much he was hurting, he kept pushing forward, and made more than one amazing comeback in the sport.<br />In addition to race riding, Stevens discusses other major events that helped shape his life - his children, his divorce, his remarriage, and the death of a fellow jockey and close friend, Chris Antley. He also talks of his relationships with various trainers and jockeys; how he makes decisions on which mounts to accept, how to ride his races, and what directions to take with his career; and he evaluates some of the great horses he has ridden, including Thunder Gulch, Point Given, Winning Colors, Serena's Song, Silver Charm, and others. He talks about his struggle with weight, and how he has managed to stay in shape for riding. Stevens has ridden in the United States, Hong Kong, and Great Britain, and he compares the atmosphere and racing procedure in these very different places. All in all, this book is an excellent inside look at the life of a top racehorse jockey.<br />The epilogue touches briefly on Stevens' acceptance of a role in Seabiscuit, the new movie based on author Laura Hillenbrand's best-stelling book. He mentions a few things about the early stages of filming - what it was like to act for the first time, to work with co-star Tobey Maguire, to see an inspiring true horse story come to life on film, etc. My one criticism here is that he does not tell us enough. I really wish he had delayed the publication of this book another year so that he would have been able to include more about his work on the movie.<br />A few reviewers here have commented on a lack of accuracy in the book. Stevens himself tells us early in the book that his accounts are based largely on his own memories, which are fallible. He acknowledges the fact that he may have made some mistakes in his recollections. I don't really hold this against him. I suspect that any autobiography will contain some inaccuracies. The author is relying largely on personal memory, spanning a very large period of time. Stevens' goal here wasn't to provide us with a data sheet on the races he's ridden; he wanted to share the experiences of his life - to show us what's brought him to where he is today. And I think he's done an excellent job at just that. Having a date off by one year here, or not being entirely clear on the legalities surrounding building rights on a certain racetrack there don't detract from the messages the book has to offer. I would highly recommend this book to any horse racing enthusiast.ith a data sheet on the races he's ridden; he wanted to share the experiences of his life - to show us what's brought him to where he is today.

Her size (she was larger than most fillies, and as a yearling had a girth greater than Secretariat's at the same age) and her effortless, ground-eating stride made the nearly black daughter of Reviewer (by Bold Ruler) and Shenanigans an imposing figure on the track. She broke her maiden the first time out, obliterating the field with a 15-length lead. Ruffian went on to win each one of her next nine races over the course of her two- and three-year-old seasons, making her ten for ten by the time she was to face the colt Foolish Pleasure (1975 Kentucky Derby winner) in one of history's most highly publicized match races. Unfortunately, no one would ever know who was the greater horse - Ruffian broke down during the race, her right foreleg shattered to pieces. She was half a length in front when the leg snapped. Though her chances were incredibly slim, veterinarians operated on the filly throughout the night on the faint hope that they might be able to save her. It was not to be, however. The surgery was a failure, and Ruffian was put down, at only three years of age.<br />This book is an excellent, moving account of this great filly's brief, success-filled career, and her tragic death. Schwartz writes in a narrative style, drawing on information from her research and numerous interviews with Ruffian's \\"inner circle\\" of humans. In preparation for the book, she spoke with trainer Frank Whiteley Jr., jockeys Jacinto Vasquez and Vince Braciale Jr., exercise riders John \\"Squeaky\\" Truesdale and Yates Kennedy, groom Minnor Massey, and many others. The book contains a wealth of information about the filly, presented in a simple, easy-to-read language.<br />My only criticism of the book (and it is a minor one) is its organization. Schwartz has divided the book into five parts, each one containing several chapters. At the beginning of each section, the story jumps ahead to the great Match Race for a chapter, and then jumps back to talk about Ruffian's earlier life and career, and so on back and forth. This can be confusing at times, and it would have been better, I believe, to write the story in purely chronological order. The interspersion of chapters dealing with the fateful match race do give the book a sense of tension and impending doom, which I think is what Schwartz was trying to do, but the effect could still have been achieved by writing in a linear fashion. As it is, the last twelve chapters of the book are dedicated to Ruffian's final race, and the chapters stuck in earlier could easily have been included at the end instead.<br />On the whole, however, this is an excellent book. It is well-researched, well-written, and well-editted. The writing is easy to read (I finished the book in a little over a day), yet remains detailed and emotional. The reader can really feel for this great filly - exhilaration with her triumphs and heartbreak at her premature breakdown and death. Eight black and white photos of Ruffian are included at the end, showing her in various stages of work and repose with the people that were closest to her. This book does Ruffian the highest justice, and I would recommend it to any horse racing enthusiast.head to the great Match Race for a chapter, and then jumps back to talk about Ruffian's earlier life and career, and so on back and forth.

US	46057280	R32ZJ8E0ZMN9AT	0393050149	781453690	Build Me an Ark: A Life With Animals	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Worth reading, but leaves room for improvement.	This book contains a series of vignettes that form author Brenda Peterson's memoir. She takes us from her early childhood to present day through stories of her interactions with animals, beginning with her father's hunting trophies - her first animal \\"companions,\\" and ending with the story of a sea lion that visited her beachfront property the day before she finished writing the book. Intermediate topics include Smokey the Bear, wild wolves, her pet dogs and cats, both captive and wild whales, her struggle to reconcile the world of animals and religion, and others.<br />The first third of the book turned me off a little. The stories of her childhood seem overly embellished with an abundance of flowery adjectives that strain the writing. These early stories don't have the same impact as the vignettes describing Peterson's experiences as an adult. The stories from her adulthood show more understanding of the world and are easier to relate to. My two favorites where the tale of a captive beluga female who exhibited profound mourning behavior after the death of her newborn calf, and the painful account of the effects of Navy sonar experiments on wild whales. The latter of these was quite heart-wrenching.<br />The book is dragged down, however, by poor editting. In addition to the superflous writing style that permeates the first several chapters, the entire work is riddled with typos (i.e. \\"Alaksa\\") and spelling errors (i.e. \\"decibals\\"). There are also a few punctuations errors. In addition, Peterson displays a lack of scientific background. She is a journalist, not a biologist. While she refers to the work of biologist acquaintances and is by no means ignorant, the impact of her writing would be enhanced if she herself had a more thorough scientific understanding.<br />On the whole, however, this memoir is worth reading, though I'd recommend borrowing it from the library or a friend that already has it rather than purchasing it for yourself. It does bring awareness to some critical environmental issues - aerial wolf killings, the detrimental effects of pollution and sonar testing on marine animals, the general public's misconceptions about certain wild species, etc. Hopefully it will inspire readers to do further research on these subjects for themselves and make them more conscious of the effects human lifestyles have on the environment.some critical environmental issues - aerial wolf killings, the detrimental effects of pollution and sonar testing on marine animals, the general public's misconceptions about certain wild species, etc. Hopefully it will inspire readers to do further research on these subjects for themselves and make them more conscious of the effects human lifestyles have on the environment.	2004-01-03

After submitting ads to equine journals requesting that women send in their stories of their experiences with horses, they received over 300 responses. 58 were selected for inclusion in this book.<br />Each vignette is unique - some are only a few sentences in length, others take up a whole page, and the content of each is as widely varied as the length. Contributors include owners, riders, trainers, children and adults, amateurs and professionals, a mounted police officer, an equine photographer, a Standardbred racehorse driver, a veterinarian, and more. Topics covered range from stories of healing, horses as an escape from and balm for life's problems, a child's first horse, memorials for favorite horses that have passed on, lessons learned from horses, obstacles overcome, goals made and reached, or simply a description of a favorite moment with an equine friend.<br />My two favorite stories were one by a woman whose two horses were stolen and sold for slaughter, and the miraculous way they were rescued and returned to her; and a second by a woman who had adopted a Mustang whose previous owner had abused her, and the journey of trust-building and healing they have gone through.<br />Each vignette is accompanied by a beautiful full-page photograph of the contributor and her horse. The black and white photography gives the book a classic, elegant, timeless feel, and captures each horse and woman in a crisp, beautiful portrait shot. Some of the shots are posed, others candid, and this too adds to the variety of the book.<br />This book is heartwarming, fun, and uplifting - an alternate title could easily be \\"Chicken Soup for the Horsewoman's Soul.\\" I would highly recommend it to any female horse lover. Buy it for yourself - it's great for either the bedside or the coffee table, or buy it as a nice present for a friend. Or both! I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a sequel.nt for a friend. Or both!

Building on the work of previous psychologists interested in the study of the female mind, Mary Belenky and her colleagues have conducted interviews with a sample of 135 women enrolled in various teaching institutions (whether it be a university, community college, or some other institution such as a clinic to aid parents). The authors looked for patterns in the responses they received, and were able to draw together a concept of how women deal with knowledge.<br /><br />The small size of the sample of women interviewed may be looked upon by some as a weak point of the study, but there are some strong motives behind this conscious choice the authors made. Belenky and her colleagues wished to get to know each woman personally, and to conduct a full, comprehensive interview with each one so that they could provide examples to accompany their theories, rather than simply quizzing an overwhelmingly large study group and giving their supporting evidence only in the form of numbers and statistics.<br /><br />The authors have identified five different \\"ways of knowing\\" that women utilize. The first one addressed is given the name of silence. By \\"silence\\" the authors do not mean an absence of speech, but rather a state of being intellectually voiceless. They do not see themselves as beings capable of receiving or retaining knowledge, and are therefore subject to the control of those around them.<br /><br />The second way of knowing discussed is termed \\"received knowledge.\\" Received knowers believe themselves able to learn from others, and even to pass on what they have learned, but they do not see themselves as capable of independent, original thought. The authors identify both silent women and received knowers as dualists. They see things in terms of black and white, right and wrong, and one of the two is always seen as superior to the other.<br /><br />\\"Subjective knowers\\" do realize that they have the ability to formulate knowledge for themselves, and rely on a strong inner voice with which they develop their thoughts. They believe all knowledge to be subjective, and every person's opinion to be equally valid, though applicable only to that person. In this sense, subjective knowers are multiplists rather than dualists. They recognize that there are shades of grey and that one answer to a problem may not be better than another.<br /><br />\\"Procedural knowers,\\" which might also be called objective knowers, base their development of knowledge solely on objective, scientific procedures. They distrust as fallible any sort of \\"gut instinct\\" that the subjective knowers rely so heavily on. Procedural knowers are also multiplists, however, in that they recognize that there may be more than one \\"right\\" answer in a particular situation. This way of knowing is identified as more masculine, and that which tends to be advocated in traditional educational institutions.<br /><br />The last way of knowing is referred to as \\"constructed knowing.\\" These women see all knowledge as contextual, and rely on both subjective and objective methods to arrive at \\"truth.\\"<br /><br />I would like to point out that, while one can get the impression from the text that these five ways of knowing are a sequence that one progresses through in the order they are discussed, this is not always the case. Any given woman may shift between any particular ways of knowing in any order, and over any period of time, and they may not ever experience every single one of them. In fact, I would venture to say that most women do not experience each one. A woman may also fall between two different ways of knowing, or may, at any given point in her life, utilize one way of knowing in one aspect of her life, and a different one in another. For example, a woman may be silent in her home environment, but act procedurally in her workplace.<br /><br />Belenky and her co-authors go on to look at how these ways of knowing appear within family structures, and what the consequences of each on both parents and children are. They conclude by evaluating modern academic institutions and proposing a method of education that would be more suited to women.<br /><br />The authors do not compare and contrast male and female ways of knowing in this study - male ways of knowing really aren't looked at at all, except to point out the influence traditional male thought has had on women. Neither do the authors hold one or the other up as being superior. They simply recognize that men and women tend to approach knowledge differently, and that ways of knowing that work for men may not work for women. This is certainly not any sort of final word in female psychology, and even the authors make note of the fact that others may interpret the results of their study differently, but it is a very worthwhile and thought-provoking read and I would highly recommend it.ern academic institutions and proposing a method of education that would be more suited to women.

This is the critical question Barbara Pym addresses in her novel, Quartet in Autumn. She takes us into the lives of four aging co-workers on the brink of retirement; they are no longer of use to anyone and their department will be phased out as soon as they leave the company. Marcia, Letty, Edwin, and Norman are all alone, without friends or relatives to care for them in their later lives. Each of them is terribly lonely, yet they are too stubborn and ashamed to turn to one another for friendship.<br />The novel is moving, and sometimes downright scary. Indeed, Pym shows us that such a fate could easily belong to anyone in today's society. She makes it readily apparent that the resources and aid available to the elderly are insufficient. Few people truly care what happens to those who are no longer of any great use to the modern world. It is a bleak prospect, and this book serves as an important warning. The book is also hopeful, however. Ultimately the main characters do manage to reach out to one another, and this is heartwarming. It shows us the value in cultivating relationships with others.<br />I read Quartet in Autumn for a women's studies course, and while it is not particularly exciting or enthralling, it is quite thought-provoking. It's an easy, short read (roughly 200 pages), and uses plain, to-the-point language. Pym really pares it down to the issues at hand and throws in no extraneous fluff. I would recommend this work to just about anyone (regardless of age - it's message is equally important to the old and young alike). It raises awareness of a very important, yet seldom looked at aspect of the social world of today.	2003-12-19
US	46057280	RH4D2X6H1GFQX	158150067X	909024187	Women in Racing: In Their Own Words	Books	4	2	3	N	N	An insightful new look at the racing world.	This book is a collection of interviews with eighteen women working in different aspects of the Thoroughbred racing industry - trainers Linda Rice, Jenine Sahadi, and Christine Janks; jockeys Patti Browne, Donna Barton Brothers, and Zoe Cadman; reporter Charlsie Cantey; breeder Alice Chandler; groom Francesca Rabadan; photographer Barbara Livingston; track veterinarian Mary Scollay; publicist Jane Goldstein; racing officials Christine Salvino and Donna Porter; chart caller Sheryl Stefanowicz, journalist Maryjean Wall; jockey's wife Dot Sibille; and pari-mutuel clerk / horse tattooer Charlene Burkhardt. The range of perspectives is very nice.<br />Each woman brings a unique view of the industry, but there are also a lot of similarities running between them. Many, though not all, had families with backgrounds in horses. Almost all noted the fact that they had to work much harder than men in the same fields. Some were very conscious of sexism in their workplaces, and others found that the best way to deal with it was to ignore it entirely. Most of the women interviewed commented on the growth of the industry which has led to a more cutthroat atmosphere in recent years and the loss of great racing personalities. Every single one arrived at their place in life through an intense love of horses.<br />In terms of good writing, the book is not the best. The interviews are transcribed very directly, and the simple fact is that people do not speak in the same way that they write. There are times when the reading is awkward due to grammatical errors or patterns of speech that are not used in written language. The book would have flowed more nicely if the authors had either done their own write-ups on the women (the brief introductions before each interview read very well, for example) with extensive quoting, or had at least done a little more editting to the interviews themselves. Words such as \\"like,\\" which are found randomly placed in sentences, could have been removed.<br />On the whole, however, the book is a fairly easy read (I was able to finish it in one day), and is very worthwhile. The women's stories are inspiring and often heartwarming. The chapter on Jenine Sahadi really made me smile. She's a tough and determined woman who's good at what she does, and I have gained a whole new respect for her. Francesca Rabadan's story brought tears to my eyes - she's been through so much and has come through with her gentle soul intact, and that is truly amazing. I also particularly enjoyed the interviews with Charlsie Cantey, Zoe Cadman, and Dot Sibille. I would love to see a sequel to this book someday that would introduce us to more of the outstanding women involved with Thoroughbred racehorses.>On the whole, however, the book is a fairly easy read (I was able to finish it in one day), and is very worthwhile.

I first purchased this book in it's second edition, and snatched up the third edition as soon as it came out! I only wish Browell could update it every year. The number of new products Breyer releases annually causes the book to go out of date very quickly, and I generally pen in new items myself.<br />This guide is divided into sections by model size - traditional, classic, little bit, and stablemate, with separate sections for porcelains/resins, the Ponies series, farm animals and wildlife, and other Breyer items. Every model produced on each mold is listed with the following information: model number, year/s produced, model name/title, color, markings, any accessories, what the model was produced for if it is a special run of some sort, the number of pieces produced if it was a limited run, and an approximate value range as of the publishing date. Browell also makes note of any variations in color, markings, or finish that a particular model may have been available in. Each model (with the exception of a few very new, or very rare ones) is also pictured for visual reference. The photos are clear and well-lit, and both sides of each mold are shown, which makes identification even easier.<br />The approximate values given are only Browell's estimates and every collector should use their own judgement in purchasing and selling models. A model's value depends on it's condition, age, availability, original retail price, and other factors. Because of this, the estimates in the book are not always applicable, and it must also be kept in mind that values fluctuate from year to year. This book is most helpful for identification of models, especially when a collector does not have access to older Breyer catalogs. Though the third edition is heftier than the previous two, as is to be expected, it is still easy enough to take along when going to shows, swap meets, flea markets, etc. I have found it to be well worth purchasing and would highly recommend it to any other collector.tor.	2003-12-14

I must say I've been shocked to see some of the vicious negative responses this book has sparked. In my mind it has been very underrated. Cornwell's style in writing this book is, perhaps, not the best for a work of its type, and I think this may have made it difficult for many readers to pick out the significant points she does make. There are parts that almost have the feel of a narrative novel, and the author does present countless trails of speculation which are interesting but not provable. However, I feel the need to respond to some of the criticisms of this work that I've seen by highlighting a few things.<br />Cornwell's work here definitely does prove beyond all reasonable doubt that Walter Richard Sickert wrote a large number of the Ripper letters that were sent to the Metropolitan Police. There are definite DNA matches from stamps on at least three of the letters. The Ripper used several kinds of stationery which Sickert was also known to use, and indeed it has been proven that some sheets used for Ripper letters came from the the same package of 24 sheets as some letters Sickert sent to his acquaintances. There are countless other details that tie Sickert to the Ripper letters and I have no doubt that he wrote most of them.<br />The problem comes in that people seem to be assuming that ALL Patricia Cornwell has proven here is that Sickert wrote Ripper letters. It takes only a little mental puzzle-piecing to see that this is not the case. Some of the Ripper letters (written by Sickert) hint at events yet to come, often connected with future murders - events that did indeed end up playing out as predicted. The Ripper letters also show a knowledge of details about the victims and their murders that were never publicly released. These are things Sickert could not possibly have known unless he committed the murders (or at least some of them), or was somehow connected to the person that did.<br />The author makes mention of an incident where Sickert claimed that he had once stayed in the very room where Jack the Ripper once dwelled. He stated that the landlord had told him the identity of the killer, but that he could no longer remember the name. This seems unlikely in the extreme. Cornwell points out that when he was 80 years old, Sickert could still remember and correctly spell the name \\"Maharaja Meerzaram Guahahapaje Raz Parea Maneramapam Mucher,\\" which he had come across while passing a church memorial with his father when he was a young boy. Sickert had an astounding memory. Assuming for a moment that Sickert was NOT Jack the Ripper, it would still be obvious that he had an intense fascination with the killer, as evidenced by his having penned many Ripper letters and also in his violent art, some pieces of which make direct references to the Ripper killings. I find it unbelievable that someone so obsessed with Jack the Ripper would fail to recall his real name after having it revealed to him. So it is almost certain that Sickert was lying about the incident, possibly to shift suspicion away from himself.<br />I have seen some people mistakenly assume that Cornwell is arguing that the Ripper was left-handed. This can only be a case of mis-reading, since she is not saying anything of the sort. Cornwell argues that most of the victims seem to have had their throats cut from behind in a way that indicates a RIGHT-handed perpetrator. She also makes note of the fact that Sickert was known to be primarily right-handed, but that he was capable of writing with his left hand, as evidenced by a video. She makes this point only to show another method he may have used to disguise his handwriting (writing with the left hand rather than the right).<br />Some people have complained that Cornwell did not include enough of the art works she references in her book. Many of these are easy enough to look up on the internet - Sickert was a well-known artist in his day and his works are by no means obscure.<br />I was shocked to see one person respond by saying that Sickert looked like a very nice man based on the photos of him in the book, and that he did not look like a killer. What does a killer look like? It is a fact that a large percentage of rape and murder victims are assailed by someone they knew and trusted, a \\"nice person.\\" We've long since moved out of the days where supposed criminals are identified based on physical features that are assumed to fit the profiles of murderers, rapists, thieves, etc. A murderer can be sinister, ugly, and frightening in appearance, or they could just as well look like the sweetest and most mellow person imaginable. A murderer can look like anyone.<br />So was Walter Sickert the murderer known as Jack the Ripper? We can't be 100% sure, but it seems very likely. Cornwell has shown that he certainly had the opportunity to have committed the murders (he was in the right place at the right time), he fits the profile of a violent psychopath (though I must admit this word is beginning to sound a little hackneyed what with the number of times Cornwell uses it), and he had a very plausible motive. The fact that several other similar murders (other than the six we hear about most often) occurred in the decades following the highly publicized Ripper spree, and that these murders occurred within miles of wherever Sickert was living at the given time, is also very suspicious.<br />As I stated earlier, Cornwell could have written in a style more suited to this type of book. Many of her important points (and they ARE there!) get hidden between her numerous speculations and historical asides. I did, however, very much enjoy reading these seemingly tangential passages, as they actually paint a very good picture of life in London's East End during the late 19th century and the methods and tools utilized by criminal inspectors of the time. She has clearly done a phenomenal amount of research and I think she's hit upon something very big. So far her theory seems to be the most plausible one out there.<br />Two thumbs up!erson respond by saying that Sickert looked like a very nice man based on the photos of him in the book, and that he did not look like a killer.

This is truly one of the best books I have ever read. It's long, yes, but it's worth it. Really. I stayed up through the wee hours of the morning to finish it, I was that enraptured. It also takes some thought and reflection to tap into the deeper elements and themes of the book, but to me that's always what makes a piece of literature great.<br />The story begins in 1959 when southern Baptist preacher Nathan Price, filled with missionary zeal, drags his family off to the Belgian-controlled Congo. The book is narrated in turns by Nathan's wife and four daughters.<br />Orleanna is a passive, quiet woman who lives her life by doing as her husband demands. Her own youngest daughter describes her as wearing \\"the flag of 'We Give Up!'\\" (page 23). She does not find her own strength until Nathan has already all but destroyed their family.<br />Rachel Price, the eldest daughter, is quite possibly the most exasperating character I've yet to come across. She represents the majority of American thought at the time, viewing the Congolese as completely ignorant savages that can't even be equated with humanity. In reality SHE is the one who is hopelessly ignorant, repeatedly messing up words and phrases - i.e. \\"Give up the goat\\" rather than \\"Give up the ghost,\\" \\"More Scold\\" rather than \\"Morse Code,\\" and \\"Episcopotamians\\" rather than \\"Episcopalians.\\" Rachel's mind, what little of it there is, is consumed entirely by two thoughts: her hair, and how much she wants to go back home. She is entirely predictible and almost pitiable by the end of the book. As her sister Leah says, she has \\"the emotional complexities of a salt shaker\\" (page 474).<br />Adah and Leah are twins, the middle children of the family. In the beginning of the book, they couldn't be more different. Leah is a daddy's girl that tries her best to walk in her father's footsteps. Of course she is never good enough. Adah has a birth defect that causes her to drag one side of her body. She is bitter and reclusive, but highly intelligent and has a tendency to write and even speak backwards. Both girls change dramatically as the story progresses. Leah turns into the most amazing and spiritually beautiful woman I have ever come across in a work of fiction. Marrying one of the Congolese, she gives herself over to a life of poverty for the sake of her humanitarian aims. Adah returns to the United States where she finds a therapist that ultimately brings her to overcome her disability. She attends college and goes on to enter the field of disease research, specializing in African maladies. Both women set out to heal the scarred Congo, but they go about it in very different ways.<br />Ruth May is the youngest child, and represents the innocence that cannot survive in the vicious political world of the 1960s Congo. In the beginning I found her terribly irritating, with her blind faith in authority, but as her narrative progresses I found myself feeling more and more sorry for her and enraged at the world that refused to let her blossom.<br />Nathan Price himself is, to put it plainly, an egocentric, misogynistic prig. His opinion on education for women is that \\"Sending a girl to college is like pouring water in your shoes. . . . It's hard to say which is worse, seeing it run out and waste the water, or seeing it hold in and wreck the shoes\\" (page 56). By the time he and his family get to the Congo, the rest of the missionary movement and the Belgian-controlled government have pretty much already done all the damage, so he just bumbles around like the baffoon he is, but not without tearing his own family apart. He also represents the more widespread damaging influence of the occupying Europeans as a whole, and what they have done to the Congolese people. Nathan's almost comical ignorance is brought to the forefront in the sequence that gives the book it's title. In the Kikongo language, \\"bangala\\" means \\"precious.\\" But inflections of the voice cary great weight in the language, and the same word also refers to the poisonwood tree, a plant that will leave anyone who comes into contact with its sap with a very nasty rash. During one of his sermons, Nathan proclaims, \\"Jesus is bangala!\\" Without knowing it, he has just told all the locals that Jesus will make them very miserable indeed. He's not so off the mark.<br />The Poisonwood Bible recounts the trials and tribulations of the Price family throughout their time in the Congo, and follows the thirty-year healing process they must go through after their lives are torn assunder by their arrogant father's actions. It is a beautiful narrative of destruction, survival, recovery, and hope. I generally never make marks in the books I read, but my copy of this novel is very liberally highlighted; it holds an astounding wealth of meaningful quotations.<br />Barbara Kingsolver's writing is magnificent. Her ability to create five very different voices and alternate between them throughout the work is superb. She manages to wring emotion from the reader with her imagery. There were times I laughed, cried, or felt like hurling the book across the room in disgust at something a character had said or done. I read this for a women's studies course at my local community college, but it is such a significant work in so many areas that it could easily be worked into many curricula. It brings up issues of gender, race, religion, politics, culture, and love. If I could give The Poisonwood Bible more than five stars, I would. I'll definitely be re-reading it for many years to come!ord also refers to the poisonwood tree, a plant that will leave anyone who comes into contact with its sap with a very nasty rash.

Why do I call it a first step? While it is a very insightful book, the sample of girls Dr. Pipher includes is not large enough or diverse enough. Throughout the book, there is a general lack of attention to girls of color - African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, Latin Americans, etc. The statements Pipher makes in her book are very, very important, but for the most part they take into consideration only the experiences of white girls. Societal pressures take different forms for girls of varied ethnic backgrounds, and these differences need to be acknowledged in order to conceptualize modern American culture.<br />Nevertheless, &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot; is a book I would highly recommend, and not only to adolescent girls and their parents. All of American society, and Western society in general, needs to be made aware of what it is doing to its female youth. Adolescent boys, too, should read this, as well as adults that do not have children. These people, too, send messages to our young women, and therefore need to become conscious of what the effects of those messages are. Dr. Pipher uses the stories of her own clients to paint a vivid picture of the environment our young girls live in, and it's not a pretty one.	2003-12-03
