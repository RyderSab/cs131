What I really like about this reference tome (1000+ pages) is how every element, tag, attribute, etc. clearly denotes which browser/browser version supports the item. It's nice to be able to carry around a single book that can answer so many questions. Highly recommended.	2005-10-05

After all, David Seigel is highly regarded around Internet circles as a web design guru. Unfortunately, Siegel's graphic design background permeates his company's project management philosophy for building web sites. Basically, he advocates managing the process of building web sites like you would manage a graphic design project. Whether you agree with this or not (personally I don't), this book only contains about one-tenth of the project management depth of Steve McConnell's 'Software Project Survival Guide'.	2005-10-05

Don't do that. After I got home and had a chance to thoroughly review the content, I discovered that--there really wasn't much content. Basically, the book is an organized collection of pre-built ASP services for automating common tasks, such as usage tracking, personalization, and various company intranet and human resources tracking tasks. While the book contains a CD with all of the ASP code ready for you to customize, it does not include corresponding Microsoft Access databases to support the code. Since most of the services described within are dependent upon an RDBMS, the author/publisher should have a least included sample databases, so that working examples could be studied. That said, I have incorporated several of the ideas (but not necessarily the code) contained within the book into my own projects. This book is probably most useful for a beginner level ASP student looking for ideas and examples related to bringing a company's intranet services up to date. All others can find ample examples on various Internet sites.	2005-10-05

I bought this book primarily due to the great reviews it garnered on Amazon.com. After all, you can't go wrong when a book rates 4.5 out of 5 stars from over 25 readers, can you? Yep. This book was terrible, because of two very big problems: the book didn't say very much in 300+ pages and what it did say I don't agree with (it also tends to contradict much of Tom Peter's 'In Search of Excellence'). Or, to state it another way, the book points out about five very useful lessons/pieces of information, but takes forever to do so. Those lessons could have been summarized in about five pages--with compelling examples.	2005-10-05

Here he applies it to the web. This is probably the best book out there for learning to create web interfaces that won't send users clicking away after two seconds. My only complaint about the book is that he keeps reiterating the same core points over and over again, chapter after chapter. If it's so simple, then why am I reading 500 pages? A good book, but probably could have been condensed more efficiently.	2005-10-05

Unfortunately, the material does not delve as deep as Nielsen does, and some of the topics may be slightly dated, whereas Nielsen's concepts are more sustaining. Both books have great examples, so which one should you read? Probably both--read this one first, since it will go a lot faster and is more humorous, and then read Nielsen to delve into a greater understanding of the concepts.	2005-10-05

Most programmers do not construct computer programs correctly, regardless of methodology, language, platform, etc. For those who don't have a formal education in computer programming (e.g., Computer Science), or for those who don't want to forget the important concepts they did learn, Steve McConnell presents a classic text that drives all of these concepts home.

Yeah, right. Although the book is aimed at beginning to intermediate JSP developers, the authors fail miserably to communicate to their target audience. Basically, you'll find yourself re-reading section after section, wondering what the authors are trying to say, and why the book is so chock full of Java code listings, with only a smattering of JSP. Other books handle the learning curve of JSP much more effectively. In fact, you're better off just using any of a number of tutorials on the Internet for learning the basics and intermediary aspects of JSP. What the authors should have done is follow the lead set with 'PHP and MySQL Web Development'. In this case, the \\"practical guide\\" was practically useless.	2005-10-05

It's more about the people building the computer than the computer and the computer industry. The interaction, the relationships, the stress, striving for a goal, working as a team. Tension. Failure.

Steve Krug systematically marches through a no-holds barred, common sense approach that will have you building more effective web sites immediately. While the book may be thin (200 pages), it's chock full of excellent, time-tested concepts on practically every page. There is a downside to the book though--after reading it, you will undoubtedly look at any interface, whether digital or structural, and ask, \\"Why did they design it like that?

Basically, After the Gold Rush is Steve McConnell's 150-page treatise on the current and proposed future state of the software engineering profession. McConnell examines, compares and contrasts software engineering with other engineering disciplines, and concludes that if we are to build more consistently reliable software systems, then we must elevate programming from a craft to a true engineering profession. The remainder of the book details how this can be accomplished. So, while I was already familiar with the difference between an education in information systems versus computer science versus software engineering, and was already familiar with the contents of the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), others may find this book very illuminating.	2005-10-05

It's even more amazing then how most companies have simply ignored the lessons illustrated within, only to continue on their dismal path of mediocrity. The basic lesson to be learned is that if your company religiously follows the core tenets outlined in the book, then your company will be the leader in your industry, because you will be the only company to do so. So why is this circa 1980's book still relevant? Because the principles apply just as much today, and they apply equally well to business of any nature.

The author, Philip Greenspun is a professor of Computer Science at MIT and has built over 100 large-scale sites. The purpose of the book is twofold: to share the author's mistakes and successful strategies so that hopefully you don't have to make the same mistakes, and secondly, to emphasize how best to leverage the collaborative power of the Internet to provide services that were impossible or impractical before. Now I know how to properly engineer an RDBMS-backed site, how to build a personalization system, how to build an online community-based system (correctly), and how to build a content management system--and tie it to the personalization system. I have already incorporated many of the core concepts of the book into my own projects. This is the best web publishing book I have read to date.	2005-10-05

PHP is one of the big four server-side scripting languages (along with ASP, ColdFusion, and JSP) and MySQL is one of the best high performance, scalable web-based RDBMS systems available. Together, they provide a powerful combination. The book is divided into two sections; the first half of the book gets you up to speed with both PHP and MySQL, while the second half presents some practical projects. The projects are the real jewel of the book. Not only are the projects described and constructed in a logical, component-based manner, but the selection of projects represents an excellent cross-section of common components that are built into many web sites, including: user authentication and personalization, a shopping cart, content management system, web-based email service, mailing list manager, and web forums. Because of the selection and clarity of the projects, this book makes a great general purpose reference for how to build these types of web applications, no matter which implementation language you choose.	2005-10-05

The book is divided into two parts. In the first half, Nielsen presents 113 guidelines for designing home pages derived from research conducted by the Nielsen/Norman Group. The second half (and bulk of the book) consists of the practical application of these guidelines in the analysis of 50 website homepages. The 113 guidelines are excellent, summarizing a great deal of HCI research and will be beneficial to anyone designing websites. The second half starts off strong with insightful narratives as Nielsen deconstructs each homepage, clearly illustrating the guidelines. However, after reading about ten or so of the critiques, they become quite monotonous, as each homepage clearly makes the same mistakes as the prior one. If you can manage to get through the deja vu, then the 113 guidelines will surely be imprinted in your brain and on your work.	2005-10-05

I was ready for something completely dedicated to teaching me everything I needed to know about creating a site without using a single table tag for layout. Although the book does explain how to do this, I was still disappointed. After a brief introduction about CSS (yet again), section two of the book explains how to create layouts without using tables. In all, seventy pages of 500 are centered on this topic. Half the book is a CSS reference. The other sections talk about fonts, colors, etc. Clearly, the book is mis-titled. This remains a good book for someone new to CSS, so they can avoid bad habits from the start.	2005-10-04

It's full of incredibly useful design concepts. But the concepts are abstract and may be difficult for some to apply to software design (e.g., affordances, conceptual models, mapping). It's written by one of the world authorities in usable design, Donald Norman. However, Norman's writing style alternates between the dry description of the concepts and the more interesting real-word examples of those concepts. But, most of the the real-world concepts presented throughout the book are not software-based (e.g., telephones, doors, appliances). However, all of the concepts are incredibly important to the design of usable software. In the end, if you can make it through the book and can see the application of these proven design concepts to your software efforts, then it will have been worthwhile.	2005-10-04

The book is essentially an indexed, cross-referenced, best practices guide to building web pages that attract and keep customers. Or at least keep you from pissing them off. The authors have collected and summarized a great deal of HCI research (all listed in the resources section of the appendix) on web usability, so none of this stuff is made up--it's all based on time-proven, tested, and verified data about how people actually use the Internet (e.g., see Amazon, Yahoo!, Google, et. al.). A few of the patterns are no longer considered best practices, due to evolving standards (e.g., CSS) and increasing browser standards support. This is a very handy reference book, especially for an in-depth UI checklist.	2005-10-04

Unfortunately, I think the book just misses the mark. What you get is a brief six page explanation of a particular design concept for each of the 36 included designs. This is all good, but I was hoping to see at least a few of the very advanced designs completely dissected in explanation, from beginning of the source to the end. Intermediate CSS coders will undoubtedly pick up a useful technique or two. Still, it's a good book that could have been great.	2005-10-04

Most web designers don't care about the history of captioning and transcription systems--we just want the facts, man. What should we do, and what should we avoid. Best practices. Etc. That info is in here, but you have to cut a swath through the verbosity to find much of it. Or just read the last page of each chapter, which summarizes the previous 40-odd pages in six or less sentences. Save yourself the price of the book and scan through the entire text of the book online. In the end, Building Accessible Websites is an inaccessible read.	2005-10-04

Alan Cooper (father of Visual Basic) presents for us a litany of horrific examples of interface design, and lays out the case for why spending time and money up front on usability and interaction design will produce the greatest returns of all the steps in software development. But the paradigm shift occurs in Chapters 9 and 10, \\"Designing for Pleasure\\", \\"Designing for Power\\", where Cooper hits home the power of the user-centered design process and illustrates the inherent mistakes which almost all software developers make during development. Here's a hint: if you start with requirements specifications, you're already screwed.	2005-10-04

Increased extensibility. More users. And big cost savings. That's what this book is about. Jeffrey Zeldman (of the The Daily Report) leads readers through the why's and hows of building web sites using the established standards of Structure (XHTML), Presentation (CSS), and Behavior (ECMAScript, DOM). Since most web site decision-makers don't yet grasp the significance and business reasons for moving to a pure, standards-based design, Zeldman spends the first 100 pages giving them no room for arguing against this approach (ESPN got the message--and saved tens of millions of dollars by converting their 1 billion hits per month site). The remainder of the book is spent in the trenches, providing exacting detail about how to upgrade existing sites or build new ones around standards. It doesn't hurt that Zeldman's humor and light writing style will speed you through this book. It may be the fastest read of any technical book to date--and that would be one of Zeldman's points.	2005-10-04

While much of this information has been covered before and will be familiar to intermediate and advanced XHTML coders, several of the CSS chapters are real eye-openers, even for advanced technicians. For example, in Chapter 11: Print Styles, Cederholm discusses an extremely effective technique for allowing the user to switch between alternative layouts of your page (two-column, three-column) without the need for a round-trip to the server. And Chapter 15: Styling  sounds innocent enough, but presents a technique that allows the developer to provide some basic Content Management System (CMS) functionality as applied to web templating. It's a short book (238 pages), and quick read, but may prove indispensible from a design, productivity, and business perspective. Highly recommended.	2005-10-04
