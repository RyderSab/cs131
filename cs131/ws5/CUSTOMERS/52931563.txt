Todd Boden's evil is nurtured...whether it is by the Nazi he extorts into revealing his secrets, or by himself is worth debating.  The story is a study of abject evil and how it manifests in our world.<br /><br />This is a great book.  Stephen King is a fabulous writer who can really tell a story, and this is a good story to tell.  It's dark but (unfortunately) not supernatural at all.  It's not particulary gory but very scary.  Most of us know that the scariest stories are the ones that are plausible.  Unfortunately, this story is not only plausible but unfolding today in our society.  In that regard King is prescient since this book was written before modern schoolyard massacres.	2005-10-14

By the end of 1776, the Americans had all but lost the war.  The army was an unpaid rabble.  Soldiers were deserting in droves, and turned tail in the face of the enemy more than once.  The army had zero experience.  Loyalists were providing the British all the intelligence they needed to help them defeat their fellow Americans.  Washington's ambitious deputy general got captured by the Brits and then turned traitor.  Congress fled Philadephia.  No one thought the Americans had a prayer, including the Americans.<br /><br />This story explains how all these seemingly insurrmountable obstacles were overcome by the sheer will of George Washington, a man of unbelievable faith and character.  McCollough explains that although Washington was no great general by any means, he had the eye for good generals and knew how to lead by example and inspire his men to fight when the cause was hopeless.<br /><br />After reading this book you'll scoff at the notion that the Founding Fathers should not be revered in school.  They built this nation and fought to make it independent.	2005-09-24

I guess people are afraid of them.  This story creates a  situation where either action taken will have negative consequences.  You get a sense for the struggle but not as the person struggling, but from the viewpoint of a child.  Add to that, the child knows the right answer before the adult does.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable book, and for its short length, definitely packs a wallop.  Definitely worth your time to read this one.	2005-06-27

What you'll get out of the book in addition to the movie is significant.  This book tells the story of the storm, not just the doomed Andrea Gail.  The book spends time on important subjects that have been derided by previous reviews: the science of the storm, how 100+ foot waves are formed, how water sinks a boat, how a person drowns.  The book talks about the sheer weight of water, which is astounding.  You finish the book with a real understanding of how absolutely powerless a person is against the ocean.<br /><br />You also gain a real understanding for the risks undertaken to deliver that swordfish to your table.<br /><br />By reading this book, you'll gain an appreciation for fishermen, the ocean, and the power of storms and the powerlessness of mankind on this earth.<br /><br />Additionally, those who read the audio-CD version of the book, you'll hear an interview with the author.  This is one of the bonuses of audio books that occasionally an interview is included.  This one provides understanding of what Junger was trying to accomplish with this book.  I was initial skeptical of a book trying to detail what happened on a boat that had no survivors, but Junger really pulls it off in a completely honest, effective and reputable manner (which says a lot in the age of \\"based on a true story.\\")  Well done!!	2005-06-27
US	52931563	RY4FS6JGDVCU8	0316904791	227418347	Sabbath Morn	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Interesting premise and approach	This story takes place in the span of a Sunday morning in a vacation town in Britain.  The story centers on the small town's police force and their reaction to a constable's brutal murder and the ensuing siege.  The approach the book takes is a lot like a 70's disaster movie, where there are lots of individual stories that are told surrounding the main action.  Probably a fourth of the book is spent talking about the siege, and that works here.<br /><br />The back stories are of moderate interest, and Wainwright throws in some gratuitous shockers meant to remind us that these small town folks have skeletons in their closets.  As an American it's hard to believe the siege, which involves cops in a standoff with a man armed with just straight razor.  This siege is an extrordinary event in this town, whereas in the States it's just a Friday night on payday weekend.<br /><br />I gave the book three stars probably because I had a hard time following all the different story threads, since I didn't learn all the character names I guess.  The siege idea probably works well for a European but for an American not so much.  This book would be ideal to read while actually on vacation in a European beach town.  The book is short enough to do just that.	2005-05-25

Geez, I don't know why I should bother reviewing a book that has 468 other reviews.  Not like anyone will easily find my review to maybe give me some positive feedback.  I guess I'll write this assuming I'm gathering a small loyal following of Justman review readers.  Ah...I feel energy building from a minor ego boost...let me write...no...CREATE!<br /><br />This is another great Grisham book.  I was going to give it 4 stars but man, the last 10% of the book ends up being a big payoff.  One would think that such a book would plod along to the promised denoument, but not Grisham.  He carries you along to the whiz-bang ending with great back-story about Clanton, MS and its citizens.  What a town, what a life.<br /><br />This book is another example of great writing where the journey is more fun than the destination.  Grisham sucks you in with the middle and uses it to wallop you in the end.  What a ride.  A must read, especially if you enjoyed other Grisham novels.	2005-04-27

As long as you caveat your reading with the obvious notion that some of the stories you just won't like, you'll be fine.  Unlike reading a complete novel to find yourself unhappy at the end, with this format you're not really out anything.  And since all the stories offer something to the reader, you don't have too much downside.<br /><br />These stories may come from the South, but that is a loosely-shared quality at best.  I didn't find much of anything \\"Southern\\" in several of the offerings, but perhaps my view is skewed.<br /><br />Let me recommend specific \\"don't miss\\" short stories:<br /><br />-George Singleton's \\"Raise Children Here\\" is a laugh-out-loud hoot.  Best one in the book by FAR.  Just a pleasure to read.<br /><br />-Drew Perry's \\"Love Is Gnats Today\\" is a fun and heartfelt read.  This one gives you a new perspective on a certain type of person that you may not think much of on the surface.<br /><br />Jill McCorkle's \\"Intervention\\" is another one that gives you a new perspective on a situation where you might be very apt to jump to a conclusion.  Since so much of our lives are oriented on the need to make quick decisions, I like a story that teaches the need to hold back on snap judgements and to dig a little for the truth.<br /><br />I did skip \\"Pagans\\" based on the formal book review, and the fact that it really did drag on.	2005-04-12

Ordinary people put into extraordinary situations.  Fun read.<br /><br />I gave it three stars really because there wasn't much juice here.  The book seems to plod along quite a bit.  Not a lot of things really happen here.  That's not atypical of Leonard (Tishomingo Blues also seemed a bit slow) but this book is more so.  Perhaps because there's romance involved?<br /><br />Anyway, there is a decent payoff at the end although contemplating it now it was a bit of a let-down.  The whole book is clearly headed towards a reckoning, I would have liked to have enjoyed it a bit more.	2005-03-24

This is in his classic style: character-driven gritty crime stories, with lots of interesting background.  You can mostly see this one coming, but it doesn't matter;  you really enjoy the trip to get there.  Adding new and interesting elements such as the Civil War reenactments and the drug-dealing Dixie mafia make the story interesting.  You'll enjoy all the characters - the protagionist high-diver, the slick Robert Taylor, and especially the washed up (retired?) ex-major league pitcher Charlie, who just can't stop talking about himself!  The audio version of this book gives Charlie an authentically nasal Michigan accent to boot, courtesy narrator Frank Muller, who does great work here, not brooding like his other narrations.<br /><br />Elmore scores another hit with this title...not a five star, but that's not what Elmore's looking for either.	2005-03-15

This book is widely read, which gives one reason why you should too.  Another is that it is a really really great story.  A neat idea taken to its fullest potential.  Phenomenal and moving.<br /><br />What I can perhaps add is that the audio book version is the best audio rendition of a book I've listened to (25+).  Not only do you get some well-done dramatic mood music, but you get a great narrator.  The beginning of the book you get an introduction from the author, and the end has an interview with the author.  I find these additional features really add value to books, and this is no exception.  Albom discusses his writing method, how he conceived the story, and how he became a fiction writer.	2005-02-19

Higgins simply phones in the effort.<br /><br />I've read other books as part of larger series and I never felt left out.  This book was the exception.  Unlike the Master and Commander series, or the Leaphorn/Chee mysteries, this book depends on previous books.  At least that's my assumption since this book is so lame on its own.  For example, you start this book with a lead character, but once we meet the series' principal characters, the first character gets third billing.<br /><br />This book is NOT recommended.  I gave it 2 stars because I was entertained moderately and did finish it.  (If it was really bad, I would have cut bait!)  The character Dillon is somewhat interesting, perhaps more so if you have interest in the IRA, Northern Ireland, and all that.	2005-02-15

I never thought that could be a catch phrase, but the protagionist of this story sure tried!<br /><br />This book was loads of fun.  I can't recommend it enough.  I didn't know that there was a series of Abel Jones books, and that didn't matter in terms of missing anything in character development.<br /><br />This book had an interesting story but that wasn't the main appeal.  Abel Jones was just engrossing.  You see a deeply religious man and you are fooled just as the characters who interact with him are fooled by his funny looks, short stature, and bad leg.  Jones is a huge prude who eschews reading novels, but later takes a guilty pleasure in reading a little Dickens.  Now that's funny!  Abel Jones, however, like interesting people, runs very deep and there's more to him than meets your eye or ear. Parry increases your knowledge in small measures as time goes on.  In fact, learning more about Jones more interesting than the twists and turns of the plot.<br /><br />If you get the audio book version on CD, the narrator does an outstanding job bringing Scottish, New England, and Cockney accents to life.  The narrator did the best job of any of the 20+ audio books I've read so far with his very moving performance.  I can't wait to track down another one of these books!	2005-01-22

Prepare to be transplanted not only to the empoverished cotton patch of Arkansas, but into the mind of a seven-year-old boy (Luke) of devout Baptist heritage.  This book takes you to a place where, as Grisham notes, every part of the pig gets used but the squeal.  What a trip.<br /><br />This may be a poor cotton farm, but there's lots going on here.  Mexican laborers and hillbillies come to help pick the cotton, and when they arrive you already can tell that sparks are going to fly.  All flavored with the typical boy interests - discovering girls, baseball, soda pop and ice cream, and the Saturday matinee.  Although the family is strict Baptist who get their share of fire-breathing preaching from the pastor, there's lots of secrets from the parents, a few lies, and a little more...<br /><br />Luke's grandparents play a critical role in this family.  If you have/had grandparents from the Depression-era you'll probably be able to relate to the senior Chandlers.  Stoic, proud, and industrious, just keeping up with these kinds of folks either wears you out or makes you feel lazy.<br /><br />I just noticed that this has been made into a movie.  I don't know if this would translate to the screen well.  Much of the book's appeal is in what Luke is thinking, how he is assessing situations, and making judgments.  If you take away the lens of the boy, this story loses lots of substance.  I don't plan on ruining my appraisal of the book with watching the movie!  This book is currently selling used for a penny, and is a quick and enjoyable read.  What a deal!	2004-12-22

As a former tanker from the same tank regiment that fought these battles, I found the book extremely informative to how the battle was fought in detail.<br /><br />The book provides gritty details on how the fighting went, details that escape the media's treatment.  Modern warfare is a grisly affair and the details are here.  Also informative is the information on the enemy's composition and tactics.  Syrians and Fedayeen were the principle enemies.  Suicide tactics were commonplace but thankfully ineffective.  Ordinary Iraqis wanted nothing to do with this fight.<br /><br />Zucchino talks about the soldiers.  It's disheartening reading about specific soldiers in detail because you know from Zucchino's pattern that this soldier will die in the coming pages.  Each of these guys is a professional warrior.  The story of a severely wounded soldier who cries not for his disfiguring fate but because he is being pulled off the line is moving.<br /><br />As military history, this is the first draft.  This book offers the chance for us to review the strategy of rapidly taking Baghdad.  Much congratulations goes into telling us how tanks should never go into a urban area as the lead attack force, etc. and yet they succeeded here.  Given the current state of Iraq, I think the question should be whether our attack should have been so rapid and terrain-oriented.  I would counter that given the nature of the forces, we would have been better-served to have been force-oriented and found ways to draw the enemy into fights in order to destroy them, as opposed to forcing them to go to ground only to attrit us later with IEDs.  To eradicate cockroaches, you need more than a big floppy shoe.  You need traps.<br /><br />This is a MUST READ for any army mechanized warrior, or anyone interested in military history.  I would like to see Zucchino write chapter 2 on how mechanized forces deal with stability operations and insurgency warfare.	2004-12-16

Further, this was the first time I found significant value-added from reading the audio CD version of a book.<br /><br />I read this with little/no baggage coming from familiarity with Leonard's earlier \\"Get Shorty,\\" of which this is a sequel.  This book stands very well on its own and Leonard got me up to speed nicely.  Indeed, someone familiar with Get Shorty will definitely enjoy this book more, with allusions and inside jokes referring to the previous book that I'm sure I missed.<br /><br />The story was just LOTS of fun, and it actually offered a view into how Leonard develops his books through Chili's discussion on how he develops movies.  And if you get the audio CD version, you get to hear an interview with Elmore Leonard where he talks about his writing process.  (If you're an aspiring fiction reader, this is a must!)<br /><br />The book is great but very compact.  Chili and Linda are fun characters, but all of Leonard's characters are great.  The exposure of the music business was eye-opening, and you may not look at the Big Music Industry the same again.<br /><br />Additionally, the audio version includes the track \\"Odessa\\" which was written for the book by the band The Stone Coyotes.  Hearing it at the end of the book was awesome, and the song is really good too!  The only downside to the audio CD version is having to listen to the narrator, Ron McLarty, try to sing the lyrics from the book.  It was absolutely awful.  I turned down my radio until the storm passed.  Yikes.  If you can't sing...DON'T!<br /><br />After completing this book, I saw that the movie version is in the wrap phase.  I laughed when I saw that The Rock is cast as the gay Samoan bodyguard, because in the book, Leonard drops a big hint that he had The Rock in mind to play the part!  I really look forward to hearing more about the movie...based on the cast listed on imdb.com, it is a promising project.	2004-11-23

I think Bryson must have had a minimum word count he had to meet.  Some parts of this book are laugh-out-loud funny, but these are needles in a haystack.  Throughout much of the audio version of this book I just zoned while Bryson whined about crummy architecture.  (We GOT it: socialists make crappy buildings.)  Thanks to Bryson I have improved my drivetime daydreaming skills.<br /><br />I expected the book to be an analysis of the Brits from an American point of view.  This is not Toqueville, however, and since Bryson spent so much time in Britain, I don't think he offers the right perspective.  His view is tainted by his 20 years as an expatriate.  (His book on the U.S. from the view of a returning exile I expect is much more pertinent.)<br /><br />Bryson loses many opportunities.  He doesn't talk to anybody.  He doesn't approach the book from the perspective of a prospective American tourist either.  Rather I think his book was his way of doing one last trip through Britain while deducting it as a business expense.	2004-11-09

Being in the banking industry, I viewed this as \\"professional development\\" but fortunately for you, it didn't delve into banking in great detail.  The story deals with an emerging threat and how the lead character, a PW accountant by training, hunts down the terrorist by tracking the finances.  This activity complements the more familiar methods of combatting terror.<br /><br />I thought the book was a great read overall, and the ending was climatic to be sure.  Lots of twists and turns, and points of excitement throughout.<br /><br />My only beef with the book is that my TV brain likes a neat ending that wraps up all the loose ends.  These book writers like to stop short and end the book abruptly, and Reich's book is no exception.	2004-10-20

Beside that, it was a very good read.  The facets of the book are very interesting, in that it touches on multiple aspects that could be books on their own.  For example, the treatment of the mutiny court-martial could make a good \\"Law and Order\\" episode or movie.  The open boat trip makes for a study in survival.<br /><br />Although some reviewers criticized the focus on Thomas Heywood, I find it interesting to understand the power to revise history.  Indeed, the concept of \\"spin\\" is an old one.  It is amazing how a convicted mutineer could get off scott-free with the right friends and the right spin.

This is a much finer history of the Second World War than any book I was issued at West Point.  The book is very easy to read, and Keegan avoids the rote history narrative, and applies great analysis.  The absolute best part of this book is the section on arms production.  If you're not proud to be an American after reading that chapter nothing will!  (The US outproduced all the other warring nations combined.)  Keegan's analysis of partisan warfare during WW2 debunks the myth of the French Resistance.	2004-09-02

In order to understand the decisions our nation has made after 9/11, you must read the Churchill story.  In order to understand why Bush has taken the tack he has, you need to understand the British experience in the years before and during Nazi aggression.  The most telling part of this book is the discussion around how some in Britain were contemplating negotiating terms with Germany after seeing the French fall so quickly.  Of course, Churchill would have none of it, and being a student of history, he believed immensely in his own people, and he fired up his nation.<br /><br />Keegan's book is about Churchill as a glory-seeker as a young man, and about Churchill as a master orator.  Keegan uses many quotes from Churchill speeches to illustrate the book.<br /><br />Of course the neatest thing about Churchill is that his mother was American!  He also switched political parties twice!  In order to understand political leadership in the face of overwhelming adversity, you need to read this fine book.  I recommend the audio version, which uses an actor to imitate Churchill for the speech quotes.  It sounds cheesy and it is at first, but it adds a further layer of texture that I appreciated.	2004-09-02

You'll almost always find something you like, and if you don't like it you're not stuck with it for long.  I enjoyed all these stories and highly recommend this book.  Leonard spans a good range of subjects, settings, and people all while continuing with his strength of character development and gritty plot lines.  My only criticisms are that many of these stories read like script treatments for TV and movies.  I think that if you take the time to read a book it should offer more than TV in convenient book form.  Also, I think Leonard at times takes the easy way out in describing his characters.  Instead of spending time describing, he just tells you that he/she looks like movie star X.  It's concise but lazy; it does get the job done.	2004-09-02

The narrator is the title character, and we learn quite a bit about Odd Thomas.  I think Dean Koontz spends a lot of time convincing us he's the story's hero, to the point of excess schmaltz...I mean, this kid is a little too goody-two-shoes to the point of some caricature.<br />I would have given this book 5 stars, but I dinged it because it is clearly \\"influenced\\" by the movie \\"The Sixth Sense.\\"  (If this came out before the movie I'll add a star.)  However, I really enjoyed that movie and this book, and chances are if you liked the movie you'll like this title.<br />When English teachers ask their students to write a paper on arts that were influenced by the attack of 9-11, this book will be on a good student's list.  The sense of an ordinary hero resonates with portrayals of the citizen-heroes of that day.  Even the plot of the book itself echoes that tragedy.<br />I also really liked the ending to this book.  (Don't let anyone spoil it!)  Sometimes the ending of a book comes abruptly and the author, thinking how bloody clever he is, leaves lots of loose ends for you to figure out how maybe things ended up.  Dean does a nice wrap-up, kind of like the end of a \\"Law and Order\\" episode without the crap sarcasm from Lenny.<br />This book could definitely become the first of a series.  We have a good hero, development of his friends, and an interesting talent in the hero that would make a good vehicle for future books.

The plot twists are so obvious you could read this book by skipping every other page and still figure the whole thing out.  About as challenging a mystery as the OJ Simpson trial.  The sad thing about this book is how hysterical the protagonist gets.  I mean talk about reinforcing female stereotypes.  She's just a poor helpless doctor that shows all this compassion, yet comes undone under all this pressure, boo-hoo!  So the book is predictable, but it was kind of an interesting story, especially since it's not a bad rip-off from the book \\"Coma.\\"  Ok, people can make money from selling organs.  Now do something interesting with it.	2004-08-16

(If you knew what a cheapskate I am, you would understand the significance of this.)<br /><br />King takes the reader back to Connecticut in 1960, and then transits us forward with a few stops on the way to present day.  This is a set of multiple stories, all intertwined and working towards a singular conclusion.  I like this method since its the best of both worlds - the variety of short stories with the overall storyline of a novel.  This book is part science fiction - the beginning story, \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats,\\" is great, and calling it sci fi seems to be discrediting.  The title story, Hearts in Atlantis, actually opens a window on the burgeoning peace movement of 1966.  I found this story interesting when overlayed with the current war in Iraq.  It reads a little like an explanation of why people joined the anti-war movement.  The pro- and anti- Vietnam War characters are cariactures, however. (Like all artists, King is naturally biased against pro-war views, but he balances this with events that take place later in the story.)<br /><br />Strangely, the movie \\"Hearts in Atlantis,\\" is actually the story \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats.\\"  The Hearts title, when paired with the second story, makes perfect sense, but I wonder how many movie-goers left wondering where the heck the title came from?  Hearts, of course, refers to the card game that becomes the undoing of U of Maine freshmen.  Atlantis represents the pre-Vietnam world, the Baby Boomer good life.<br /><br />I enjoyed listening to the audio version this book.  William Hurt does the best job of any audiobook reader I've listened to yet.  I guess there's no substitute for good acting (hello Ben Affleck?).  Stephen King also does a great job reading.  I can't help thinking that the title story, set at the University of Maine in 1966, is somehow autobiographical just in the way King reads the first-person narrative.  This book uses music, which is unusual with the unabridged titles, and is fairly effective.  The Platters song at the end will give you a great ending to a great book.is unusual with the unabridged titles, and is fairly effective.

US	52931563	RILUHX59XYYTM	0440241073	782272714	The Summons	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Nice Story	I listed to the audio version of this book.  This was my first Grisham novel so I have no frame of reference.  That said, I definitely enjoyed what sound like hallmark aspects of Grisham's stories (ie. law and the South).  The protagonist comes across as a stand-up honest guy, but you see the gradual effect of greed on this person.  The whole book you're trying to figure out who is chasing Ray, and whether or not his dad was an honest judge, an avid gambler, or a huge crook.  You really get a sense of Clanton, MS in this story, to include the fatty food and other local charms.  Without passing judgment, Grisham illustrates the greed of tort law and how its manipulated (especially in Mississippi).  This was a decent read, probably better for new Grisham readers.	2004-07-22

Kreider writes in a tone appropriate to a ground-pounder who wants to make the break from Uncle Sugar and get a job.  The book reads well non-sequentially, so you can go to the chapter dealing with your issue.  Further, chapters are short, quick reads with no B.S.  This book even chastises you in chapter 9!  (I won't give away the surprise.)<br />Kreider seems like a good guy - I ordered his book direct in 1998 and my order was lost.  When I chased it down he sent me my copy gratis.<br />In this crappy economy I've returned to this book and it's been wonderful!	2002-11-19
