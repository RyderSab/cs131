Even if you don't make a single thing in this entire book - it's such a treat to look at.   I love to hand-sew, and items like these are perfect for me. I think the directions are clear and easy to follow.  Of course, some basic sewing skills are helpful.  I adore the fabrics she uses.  I am so eager to start hunting more fabrics for future projects.	2005-05-03

I will probably end up using some of the quotes for classroom use. I do feel that a nice variety of poets were used for this book. Though the interviews themselves can be somewhat dry at times, this is a book that poetry instructors should peruse.	2004-12-23

I also enjoy this particular period in history, so this was a perfect match for me. I would love to have been part of the Plato club, or study cooking, or sewing, or heard concerts throughout the week. I sometimes think we have so much going on in our lives right now that we don't take the time to slow down and cherish the simple things. This book did that for me. It made me want to study and focus on things.  I know we have tons of technology available to us, but I wish we would still discuss philosophy, and I wish more people would read - I mean, really read.  Not just the top twenty things out there. But times are different...	2004-12-14

So, I had no expectations.  I didn't mind the novel. I found it quick to read, and the story was entertaining. Plus, I loved the history part the most. That time period is fascinating, but the genre isn't necessarily one of my favorites.	2004-12-06

I still can't imagine what it would be like.  I have a much greater respect for climbers now. They really are a different breed of people. I know, after reading this, that I do not have what it takes.  I admire those people, and mourn those that didn't make it.	2004-11-20

So, in turn, I dilligently read and looked for the hard parts.  I really didn't find anything.  It kept my attention. I loved seeing the journey that Tess was on.  I watched her character change drastically from beginning to end. It was fun to see that change.  I will read more Thomas Hardy because of this experience.	2004-11-04

Who would've thought so many passages would reflect the way our government needs to be right now?  I was delightfully surprised to read paragraph after paragraph and be able to tie it in to today's world. <br />  I think our government should read this so they can figure out what they should be doing rather than what they are doing.   <br />	2004-10-23

It speaks volumes on the way things are today even. I so respect the author's views and thoughts on life and censorship.

But I am fascinated with the Native American struggle, so this was just what I was looking for. The struggle, the ritual, the honor involved with the people of that day - it makes me respect the culture so much.  I feel horrible about the way they are/have been treated.

So anything I pick up that reflects those days is always gripping for me.  As far as the story itself, I must admit it took me awhile to get into it.  The beginning has much background info - needed info, but I was so ready to read about the daily lives and struggles and successes of the people.	2004-08-15

But each and every actor must discover that process on their own.  I think a person not very familiar with the process would find this book enlightening and intriguing.  However, people in the field are familiar with homework techniques, different methods, and various training schools.

It's fictitious letters between the author and the dead Sarah Bernhardt.  I found that to be a bit strange - especially when they would argue back and forth in their letters to one another, and then apologize.  Other than that, you do learn some bio information on Sarah Bernhardt - not as much as I would've liked.  There are some pictures, and it is a very quick read.	2004-06-14

I &quot;became&quot; each of these women.  I wanted to live their lives and experience what they were going through.  I identified mostly with Lena.  I don't think she was as stupid as everyone said - she's a much deeper character that doesn't quite know how to express herself.<br />I wonder if women tend to identify with these characters more?  I would love to see these made into a movie.<br />The language was difficult to follow at times.

It takes me back to a time in my life when I reguarly daydream adventures like those in Narnia.  I think it reminds us of imagination, and freedom, and child-like wonder.

It was written in 1966 and the photos are so interesting to look at.  But, the best part - every single one of his essays in the book is still relevant today.  Which is not a good thing.  It really made me stop and think about how far we haven't come as a nation - even though we think we're leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else.  We are a selfish group of people, we contradict most of what we say and do, and we are blind (or look the other way) to many of our actions.<br />I really was appalled by the truth in which he spoke.

I used to read many of his legal thrillers till I figured out they were all the same.  So, I decided to tackle this.  Some of the dialogue is trite and unnatural. The story tends to be sappy in places.

I don't have most of the herbs on hand at any given moment.  Some of them would be difficult to find in a pinch.  The basic ones I have, but some of the uncommon ones are things that I've never even had in my house.	2004-03-12

I was continually sharing the poems with anyone around me.  I think that's what poetry should do.  He inspires me to write more and be more observant of the little things.  I like the rough edge the poems have.  They seem so raw and written with such passion. Check him out if you have never read Bukowski - give it a try.	2004-03-12

But, don't think it'll teach you how to knit.  I think there are much better books out there to &quot;teach&quot; knitting.  This is a book letting you realize that you aren't alone in your love for knitting.  It's a delightful quick read.	2004-03-12

This is full of excellent essays about Lear. However, the basic student might find them over-the-top and hard to read.  Students interested in Shakespeare for major purposes will find that this is a great reference to keep on hand.	2004-03-12

It seems as if people have the basic Shakespearean tales, but these are some of his best and many people don't know about them. They are easy to read - uncumbersome.  Wonderful for the classroom.	2004-03-05

It is so sad that the hatred and violence that Quentin Crisp experienced years ago is still around today.  I did feel lik I really knew the man after reading the book.  He is very honest and very dry.  A good read.	2004-03-05

The Cliff's Complete on Lear is MUCH better and much more in depth. Perhaps use the two together?	2004-03-03

You first must know King Lear, then study its history and you will find this to be a great resource.  The name changes, the character changes, the condenscing of scenes. I would love to see this performed!	2004-03-03

Near the end I had more of a struggle to stick with the story.  The story just pulls at your heart and I found myself continually shaking my head saying, &quot;What can possibly go wrong now?&quot;  It is very disturbing to even think that scenes like this actually happened.  It makes me terribly sad.	2004-02-24

There aren't many books out there that actually make me cry.  This book hooked me from page one.  Not only because of the story, but because the writing is outstanding.  I love how it's out of order and how the reader is taken into the dream world and reality seemlessly.  I read it in a matter of hours and could not put it down.  <br />I have yet to see the movie and must admit that I'm a little afraid that it won't live up to my expectations from the novel.  I will probably venture out and see it some time. Trust me the book is amazing!	2004-02-17

For the person that needs to write an indepth paper or do indepth research this is probably not the choice for you.  It's a good basic tool for the beginner though.	2004-02-16

Students may find it useful for that, but the study topics and other info pales in comparison as to what is out there on the web regarding this topic	2004-01-27

Everyone must find their own feet to stand on.  I find that the college students I teach respond well to this particular piece.  The violence, gore and blood keep our up-to-date students involved.  They also seem to respond well to Aaron.  They are amazed at the evilness and the twisted plot.  I will continue to teach this in my classroom and think this version is just fine for the beginning Shakespeare student.	2004-01-12

It always helps me to actually have someone beside me &quot;showing&quot; me how to do something. I do know that the patterns in the back are awfully dated - I will NOT be using them - when and if I ever figure out how to crochet.	2004-01-12

There are many, but most of them are in basic textbooks anyway.  If you're new to books on creativity - this will be good for you. If you've explored it already, it may be a bit remedial.	2004-01-12

So, I developed an Excel spreadsheet that's just like the book and I use that instead - it's just easier since I'm ALWAYS near a computer.	2004-01-05

Consequently, I am knee-deep in Woody Allen movies.  I had never been exposed to him before and learned a great deal by reading this book.  For the beginner, it's a nice way to be introduced.	2004-01-05

I am doing something dreadfully wrong and can't figure it out from the little pictures.  I think the stuff in the book is beautiful, but I doubt I'll ever get there. I have tried and tried, and had other people look at the book; but I still seem to be randomly increasing and decreasing and have no idea how I am doing it.  Frustrating! Needless to say, I am putting the book away for now.  Maybe some other time...	2003-12-31

I guess I'm more of a visual learner and need to actually &quot;see&quot; the action happening.  I had many goof-ups and resorted to looking at other books and trying to figure out what I was doing wrong.  I am trying one of the scarfs, but I don't know if I'm really knitting or just doing some made up stitch - mine really never looks like it does in the book.	2003-12-31

I have read it cover to cover.  Not only am I a reader, but I do have poems published in this anthology.  I sank deeply into my arm chair and snuggled up with my cup of tea and my lap cat. I was taken on a journey that I dearly loved.  What a beautiful way to spend a relaxing evening - nothing is better than poetry.	2003-09-25
