US	42265449	R2G2IMXFPZME4V	1844161811	759965537	Friday The 13th #1: Church of The Divine Psychopath	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Jason Meets James Cameron	It's been twenty five horrifying years since the original \\"Friday The 13th\\" film in 1980, although Jason didn't really show up until Part 2 a year later. Now, after countless sequels, and a match up with Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees is slicing his way into the book world. Those light, fluffy type books some years book no longer count. These are real Jason books. There is immense enjoyment and entertainment in this book, but I didn't really think it felt like a classic F13 film as other people have said. Anyways, I was out of things to read, and I saw this. Why not?. Could be fun. I saw that the girth of the book was pretty good, and was wondering how could a Jason book have enough material and story for a book like that after everything that he could possibly of done(and done to others)in 10 movies!. 11 counting \\"Freddy Vs. Jason\\". So, what is old hockey mask up too this time?. Like others have said, it seems to of picked up where 1988's \\"Friday The 13th 7 : The New Blood\\" left off. Then again, it could be where Part 6 left off as well. Who knows. It doesn't give a time frame. It starts with Jason roped down to the bottom of Crystal Lake, which happened to him at the end of both 6 and 7. The basic premise of the book has a church group, headed by charismatic Father Long, seeking a new retreat from their old strip small location. Father Long has gathered a large congregation, including pretty(full of sin!)Kelly Mills, and some right hand men. Little does anyone know that Father Long has gotten a lease on Camp Crystal Lake for the church's new residence, and has something even worse up his sleeve. As we go farther along, we see that Father Long is not who we thought he was and he plans on resurrecting Jason Voorhees as \\"God's holy vessel\\", to lay his hand on the sinners of the world. He sees Jason as a thing from God, weeding out the bad. Needless to say, the guy is cuckoo for cocoa puffs and things go really bad. A swat team of some kind is given the mission to find and destroy Jason, and the team sets up shot across the lake from the camp. Jason is brought back to life and, well, you know the rest. Most of the characters are interesingly written and developed. Walter Hobb is the down on his luck \\"operative\\" who gets involved with the mission and is the male lead of the story. 17 year old Meredith Host is the only real teenager in the story. And that is one of the best things about this book. There are some changes to the old formula. Pretty much all of the characters, and victims, are adults of varying ages. Even the main heroine, Kelly, is 26. She's where new things are different too. Kelly is a girl with a lewd past and can swear with the best of them. She's the kind of girl you would expect to be offed, and not be the main heroine. That was a nice change. There are the typical jerks here who you want to see die and cheer when they do. Curtis Rickles is quite the colorful character as well. But when the main action kicks in, it turns into something resembling \\"Aliens\\". The team moves in and there is firepower and gore galore. Once everything comes into play, the book really comes to life. The whole second half of the book is where you will have the most fun. It would certainly make for an interesting movie!. I could definitley see this on the big screen. Flaws?. Not really. The book does get quite nasty in several places. The movies do get down and dirty, but author Scott Phillips writes many parts that are quite sexual. After a while, they happen so much and are so colorfully(and nastily)written, that they no longer have any kind of effect. They become more laughable and you roll your eyes when they appear. Even in the midst of horror and terror he has someone thinking or doing something. It's like \\"enough already!\\". A little of that goes a long way. The deaths themselves are interesting. There are a number of parts where people die in a mass slaughter, so you have to stay focused and keep count. It has a pretty large body count. A number of them are cool, but some are vicious deaths that can only be pulled off in the written word, and would feel like way overdoing it in an actual film. But in the end, this is a promising first book in a new series of them. It's written pretty well, has some colorful characters, and an interesting new take on some old genre cliches. It's a fun read, and would make for a great new film in the film series.	2005-09-09
US	42265449	R3PBGLAB7ZUF7Z	076073979X	835872684	Weird N.J.: Your Travel Guide to New Jersey's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets	Books	5	9	10	N	N	That's So....Weird!	Have you ever wondered if there is a pair of dancing underwear out there somewhere in the world?. How about a mattress flying across a road late one night from nowhere?. Have you ever thought about a retired gym teacher who buys your old, smelly socks from you?. If you have, then boy are you in luck!. Those are just the tip of the iceberg of all the goodies and treats that await you in this fun, fascinating, and mind boggingly interesting read. The two Mark's, Sceurman and Moran, are two guys who started the Weird N.J. magazine years ago. A magazine that first started out as a pamphlet of all the oddities and mysteries and what have you in their home state of New Jersey. It became a magazine, and now it has gone into books, spreading their incredible weirdness for everyone to see and get hooked. The books are nicely designed, and have some incredible photographs, as well as some amazing artwork. The authors tell the reader in the beginning that this is not necessarily a book of facts. Things here are not proven or disproven. They are told, and the rest is up to you. It serves as a travel guide, but some places are not given directions too out of the area's privacy, or your own safety. The book is filled with amazing stories from different sections. Here they are. First up is the section \\"Local Legends\\", which is a chapter that deals with ongoing legends or myths in certain areas. Stories like Demon's Alley, and The Devil's Tower. After that is a small section on \\"The Gates Of Hell\\", places where people believe will lead you to the warm place. Next up is \\"Ancient Mysteries\\", a chapter on areas and structures that are shrouded in mystery as to their origin. The next section is \\"Fabled People And Places\\", a chapter about interesting people in history and folklore, that includes an albino village and a town for midgets!. Then we have \\"Unexplained Phenomena\\", a chapter which I think is easily explainable on it's own. UFO's and other, well, unexplained phenomena. \\"BizarreBeasts\\" details all the odd and scary creatures of unknown origin in the areas of NJ. \\"Local Heroes And Legends\\" is a part about people known locally for being weird, odd, eccentric, and/or just plain infamous. This section includes murderer John List. \\"Personalized Properties\\" shows you the yards, or homes, of peoples' residences that the owners have decorated. \\"Roadside Oddities\\" details those odd and cool little things you find off the beaten path. \\"Roads Less Traveled\\" chronicles the weird roads, back roads, and side streets you wouldn't want to travel down at night. \\"Garden State Ghosts\\" is a big favorite. Telling stories of ghosts and hauntings. Sure enough to leave you with the light on when you go to bed after reading it. \\"Cemetery Safari\\" is an interesting section showing all the weird and interesting final resting places and gravestones of the deceased. \\"Abandoned In New Jersey\\" is the last creepy chapter. Telling us about those old, decrepid, worn down buildings, homes, etc. that lay empty for years and develop their own stories and mystiques over the years. There is always something creepy about abandoned places. I got the \\"Weird U.S.\\" book first, before I even knew this book existed. If you got the \\"U.S.\\" book first, then you will find some of the same stories in here. But before you skip those, I must tell you that even tho some same stories are in here, there are some new stories about them that weren't in the other book, so it is still worth reading the same stories. I am so glad I discovered these books, because before I had never heard of them. They are a blast from start to finish. You cannot beat it's reporting, it's history, it's pictures, or the fascination of it all. The \\"Weird U.S.\\" one is bigger and even better. So, don't deprive yourself any longer. Get these two books and curl up and discover the weirdness that surrounds us all.	2005-03-09
US	42265449	RHW5B1CIWQTV0	0753509318	510165473	The Complete Slayer: An Unofficial and Unauthorized Guide to Every Episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer	Books	5	31	32	N	N	The Buffy Bible	What is left to say in the world of Buffy The Vampire Slayer?. Not a lot. But Keith Topping's latest, and assumably last, offering in the Buffy world, is the last one tome of Buffy lore that every fan, or newbie, must own. Topping has already least 3 previous editions of this book covering a new season as it comes along. Some may of felt gyped to shell out bucks for each new installment, when a lot of it was stuff you had already purchased and read in the other editions. But now, Mr. Topping has released his work on the Buffy universe in one big, cohesive book that has it all. One stop shopping, folks. There have already been numerous books on the show, but only a few of a fan's critical review of the material. Nikki Stafford's \\"Bite Me\\"  book was a lot of fun, but I believe that Topping's \\"Slayer\\" tops them all. In fact, I will go so far as to say that his book is THE one to have. Unlike one other one I read recently, Topping clearly loves this show. Through the good times and bad. And even in the bad times, he is more thoughtful,intelligent, and respectful than other critics. He is never too harsh, and when he has strong opinions on something, they are fair, mature, and still contain a wisp of praise even when he doesn't agree with something. But more than anything else, Topping writes with a sure hand that displays his genuine love and affection for the show, it's characters, and everyone involved in it. And to top it all off, he is quite witty and the book is filled with a number of witty and funny comments. The book is all about the episodes, and Topping has gone into each one with wonderful and insightful detail. Like most of the other books, Topping's episode guides have different categories. First, of course, is the plot of each episode itself. There is \\"Dudes And Babes\\", a funny part that pinpoints when a male or female of carying degress of hotness or importance is mentioned. \\"A Little Learning Is A Dangerous Thing\\" is a section that points out something in an episode where someone has learned, or is learning, something. \\"School Dinners\\" I think pretty much describes itself. \\"It's A Designer Label!\\" showcases the wardrobe that our characters are wearing. \\"References\\" is pretty much explainable. Pop culture references mentioned on the show. Then there is \\"Bi**H!\\", my personal favorite, that points out some of the more catty coments on the show. Mostly coming from either Cordelia or Buffy. \\"Valley-Speak\\" has dialogue spoken on the show with that oh so hip slang. \\"Logic, Let Me Introduce You To This Window\\" is one of many fans' favorites. A section that picks out moments or situations that are mistakes, or just don't make any sense. \\"Quote/Unquote\\" is basically a part that brings out some of the best lines in an individual episode. \\"Notes\\" is Topping's part of the episode where he has his final word/say and critique of the episode. \\"Soundtrack\\" is what you think it is. Music, and the artists playing it, in an episode of the show. There are a few others that pop up here and there. Ones like \\"Awesome!\\" that points out a really cool moment in an episode. \\"You May Remeber Me From Such Films...\\" tells you where you may of seen some of the more familiar people who appear in an episode. \\"Denial, Thy Name Is Joyce\\" is a funny one where the author pinpoints Mrs. Summers' cluelessness to the world around her, before findout her daughter is a vampire slayer at the end of season two. What's great is that Topping also has a section on the Buffy novels, with a minor critique of them too. That is something that would go under his \\"Awesome!\\" category. The only thing this book doesn't have, and would of been better with, is a bit of color. And pictures. But who's picky?. Topping has delivered what I, and many others, believe to be the number one Buffy book. I can't imagine anything more coming from him, or anyone, on this subject, so this book is a mighty amazing one to go out on.	2005-03-08
US	42265449	R1OAGQ4GPVW2SA	0689869576	233446951	The Suicide King (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Walking A Mile In Buffy's Shoes	If not for anything else, you have to at least give the powers that be credit for trying something new and different in the literary world of Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Shaking the foundations a little bit. The latest releases in the world of Buffy books takes you, the reader, on a slayer adventure where you choose the outcome. This is the first book in a new series called \\"Stake Your Destiny\\". The premise of these is that you are Buffy. You choose what actions you take. And when I say you are Buffy, I mean that literally. Buffy is not mentioned as \\"Buffy walks into the room\\" and so on. It is written like \\"Giles turns to you and says...\\", or \\"Xander grabs you by the arm...\\". It is written from Buffy's point of view, and you are Buffy. First things first, let's get into the story. The story doesn't give the exact time of the series it is set in. Here is what we know. It takes place in the high school years, since everyone is at Sunnydale High, but when exactly?. Jenny Calendar is there, so is Principal Snyder. So it is definitley after the majority of season one. A moment in the story I read had Giles and Jenny going off on a weekend together, so that would pin it in the first half of season two, when they were getting more intimate with each other. Plus, Xander and Cordelia are bickering a bit and not overtly flirting and coupling, so it could also happen pre \\"What's Your Line\\". But once I read the other choices you can pick, Spike and Drusilla pop up. Drusilla is described as sickly, so the story definitley takes place in the first part of season two, before Drusilla gets her strength back in \\"What's My Line?\\". Angel is also in the picture, but in the path I chose, he only makes a very brief cameo at the end of the story. And doesn't feature too prominently in others. Written by Robert Joseph Levy, whose only other Buffy work was a story in one of the \\"Tales Of The Vampire\\" volumes, the book follows a string of sudden and mysterious teen suicides. Now those suicidesare hitting close to home when Sunnydale High student body begin to fall by their own hands. Enter Buffy and the gang. After a guidance councelor takes his own life as well, The Scooby Gang get into research mode when these 'suicides' begin to not add up. Buffy quickly learns(as do you the reader with the story path I chose since it is so fast and abrupt), that an ancient demon can move from one person to another thru paper. Yep. Paper. I won't really say much more than that because it delves into the usual mumbo jumbo. At the end of each little chapter you are given three different choices to make. The sections end on a little cliffhanger where Buffy(you)has to chose a plan. Now, whatever choice of action you choose isn't going to result in a conclusive ending. There is only one ending with a resolution and an epilogue. You have to choose wisely, because wrong picks can lead to an ending of nothing being stopped and you dying. The idea itself is quite fun and creative, but with it's limited run, it just comes as so light. And therein lies the problem with the idea of these new \\"stake your destiny\\" books. The actions I chose started on page 1. By page 55, of what is already a very thin book, I was done. As the story goes on, some of the choices get a bit riskier and more serious, but not by much, and it is all over so very soon. You could read the story you chose, and go back and read the others, all in one sitting. It all add up to a fun little excursion, but hardly the stuff of great Buffy books. That being said, the story is steeped in the early days of the slayer and her gang, and the author does a fine job of re-creating those moments. It does have the feel of the show at the time, and at times you can sense walking down those old hallowed halls of Sunnydale High. Levu has the lingo down to a T. Especially Xander with his sarcasm and jokes, and Cordelia in all her tactlessness. That is what makes this book a joy. A very nice, and welcomed, return to those wonderful early days of the gang in school. I don't know how many of these new kinds of books are being planned, but they will only make fans hunger for more of the big books. I know there is another one coming out in May called \\"Keep Me In Mind\\" by acclaimed Buffy writer Nancy Holder. This book isn't without it's charm, but it won't satisy die hard fans of the adult books.	2005-03-08
US	42265449	R1FEJU83HVLG2S	0972595902	396691043	Dusted: The Unauthorized Guide to Buffy the Vampire Slayer	Books	2	9	11	N	N	Should Be Dusted	There is definitley no denying that the world of Buffy The Vampire Slayer is not lacking in the literary world. With novels, companions guides, and so on, it's made it's mark there as big as the one it gave to television. This latest book, well, it misses the mark completely. It's the one book of it's kind in the Buffy library that is not needed. Emotionless, cold, and without heart, this book seems to be written by people who call themselves \\"fans\\", and seem to only be fans of the show from seasons 1 to 3. There is no doubting the authors' appear to have the knowledge of the show's history and mythology, but does that necessarily add up to anything?. No.  The book is hardly fun or enjoyable, and comes off as incredibly frustrating and annoying more than anything else. The episode guides are pretty well done. Their knowledge of mistakes in an episode, or \\"Glitches\\" as they call them, borderline on incredibly thorough and borderline psychotic. I've seen some obsessive nit-picks and knowledgability, but some of these take the cake. The best thing this book has, that no other book I've come across did, is that they keep score for the entire series' run of the vampires, demons, etc. that Buffy kills. They also keep a running tally for the students and staff of Sunnydale High. That is probably the one redeeming thing this book has. The book also does cover the Buffy comic books, and the young adult/adult novels. Something else most others books haven't really done. It's those few things they have that are different from others. But it's not enough. But it all comes back to the episodes themselves, and the authors' highly questionable, shady, off-balanced, self satisfying, and just plain moronic reviews. Not that they are all bad. They do occassionally praise an episode, but more often than not, it seems that even then they are being pushed, unwillingly, to say something good instead of actually meaning it. Save for the usuals(Season finales(except \\"Grave\\"), Hush, The Body, Once More, With Feeling\\"). They have a particular distaste for seasons after season 3. Most of the time, their critical analysis is nothing more than long winded, pompous, and completely out of text. As if they make problems to put a certain episode in so they could throw in mighty words and sound smart and like they know what they are talking about when it really makes them sound completely clueless. The season that gets blasted with the most hate is, predictably, season 6. Instead of really saying something, they just pretty much whine and never actually see some of the brilliance and intelligence and meaning that season six really had. Everything in season 6(sans the musical)gets the heat, and more often than not, basically because it's just season 6. I'm all for different views and opinions, as I have loved the other books from fans tht have a critical look at episodes, most notably the books from Nikki Stafford and Keith Topping. But this is bordering on ridiculous. One of the worst things they say is how unrealistic the show is. Excuse me?. The show may deal with vampires, demons, monsters and whatever flight of horror and fantasy, but it's not about that. It's about being a kid, high school, growing up, hardships, lessons, growth, etc. This is the show. And for those reasons, and those reasons alone, the show was incredibly realistic for those matters alone. Where have they been?. They contradict many things they say, by praising the show for being this and being what it is, and then they throw it in it's face later for no other meaning except that they have nothing to say and forego thought or intelligence and go against what they have said before and one of the many things the show does and stands for. And if they mentioned the show being \\"soap opera\\" one more time!. One of the most annyoing things the book has is that. What they consider \\"daytime soap\\", as they mention time after menotonous time, has always been there since day one. That's like saying 'here is where the show went comedy'. It no longer becomes 'I wonder what they will say about this episode', but instead you will find yourself asking 'I wonder what ridiculous ways they will think to bash this one?'. The one, and only, funny thing they say in a book devoid of humor is something that is unintentional. In one section they say, \\"Not to be too nit picky..\\". That's the funniest thing here. They state they will not a judge an episode by pettiness or the authors' own personal prejudice, but they occassionally do. Towards the end, it becomes more insufferable and a chore to read. And it really does become quite insulting when they continue to do nothing but bad mouth episodes. An insult to the ingenious writers and the millions of fans worldwide who get it. It's almost as if Simon Cowell wrote this book. Is there anything good about the book?. Well, I already mentioned the kill tally, the books section, and such. That's about it. Not much in the way of nutty things that other reviews state. It isn't until seven 7 that even the \\"Best Line\\" section seems to actually use the best lines, when most of the previous ones, save for a few, are far from best lines and will make most people wonder why that particular line was ever even considered. They even once referred to Kristine Sutherland(Joyce Summers)as Kathleen Sutherland. Uh huh. So why the two stars?. Because of the undeniable work and knowledge of the history, the \\"Glitches\\" work, and the section on the books. While it may be somewhat of an interesting read, it just ends up being an incredibly unecessary one. One that doesn't really say or reveal anything new. Something the authors blasted the show over and over again in it's later years, but fail to see that they are in the same boat. If you really want a good book with a look at episodes from a critical stance(and not like just companion guides like the \\"Watcher's Guide\\" books), then you need \\"Bite Me\\" by Nikki Stafford. The best book of it's kind. The \\"Slayer\\" series by Keith Topping is also a must have. Like Stafford's book, it is warm, usually right on the nose, very funny, and from someone who seems to actually like this show. If I knew then what I know now, I would never of gotten this book. If it seems that I am being too harsh on this book and the authors, well, the punishment fits the crime. This book, well, it should be dust.	2005-01-02

How many times have you ever driven by a spooky looking house and thought it was haunted?. Or if there's some story to it?. Or driven by an old graveyard and wondered the same thing?. Or perhaps, saw some incredibly decorated yard and wondered how that came about?. Heard a strange noise outdoors and asked yourself if it could possibly be some weird beast?. Well, here is the book for you because it covers all things said above, and quite a deal more, because this book actually shows you, and tells you, places of the sort. All in one incredibly fascinating book that you will be unable to put down. The book is put together by Mark Moran and Mark Sceurman, two guys who have traveled all through their home state of New Jersey and have chronicled all kinds of weird, spooky, eerie, or just plain strange things into their own magazine, Weird N.J. Now they have expanded their area and have given us a book that tells the tales of incredible stuff from all over the country. Steeped in rich folklore, the book is not just above all the weird goings on, but of Americana. And yes, they are all weird. Not just weird, but weirdness that can fit into all categories. I believe that some of the more human stuff, such as the roadside oddities and personal homes and stuff are more \\"weird\\", because they are intentional. All of the stories here are put together in different sections. \\"Local Legends\\", which I think you can pretty much figure out on your own. \\"Ancient Mysteries\\" features stories that includes stuff like weird rock foundations, or odd writing and inscriptions. Think Stonehenge. Only in America. The section \\"Fabled People And Places\\" deals with people with strange appearances or the places they come from. \\"Unexplained Phenomena\\" is pretty much what you always hear, which is basically happenings that are just not explainable. Given the title, you already knew that. \\"Bizarre Beasts\\" deals with the tales of those mysterious creatures that go bump in the night. \\"Local Heroes And Villains\\" is a more human section dealing with local people who are colorful, and/or just a little off. Who doesn't have those?. \\"Personalized Properties\\" is a section that showcases people's homes or land that are decorated in odd ways. Beer cans, junk, and so on. \\"Roadside Odyssey\\" shows us those weird little places that are always off the side of the road. \\"Roads Less Traveled\\" is a spooky section on those oh so dark and mysterious roads you always hear about in horror films and scary stories. Well, here they are. \\"Gateways To Hell\\" has places where people think leads them to...well, you know. I don't think there is any reason to explain what the chapter, \\"Haunted Places, Ghostly Tales\\" is about. \\"Cemetery Safari\\" is a section that shows graves, tombstones, etc., and some of the weird looks, designs, and inscriptions that are on some of them. And the final section, \\"Abandoned America\\", may just be one of the truly creepy. Those places of interest that have long been abandoned and forgotten. Left to rot and fall apart, and left to create some scary stories. This is probably one of the most fun and entertaining books that has crossed my path in a while. It's insanely interesting, fun, and has some incredible, out of this world pictures. So, get the book, cozy up, and enjoy. And oh, a word to the wise, maybe leaving a little light on at night would be a good idea.illains\\" is a more human section dealing with local people who are colorful, and/or just a little off.

US	42265449	R1KLR1UIBJO85S	0689871457	335757682	The Casefiles: Volume 2 (Angel) (v. 2)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Something To Sink Your Teeth Into	When I first heard that a new writer was going to take over the reins for \\"The Watcher's Guide 3\\", I was a little worried. I had never heard of Paul Ruditis. My worries were not unfounded when the third volume, while still fun and competently written, came out and was a huge disappointment because it lacked so much. So, imagine my horror when I learned he was going to do the new Angel book. Oh no. Well, was I so happily surprised!. Teaming up with Diana Gallagher, Ruditis has redeemed himself with a book that stays true and faithful to the first book, and makes WG 3 a distant memory. Ruditis and Gallagher pretty much keep the same pattern and style as Nancy Holder on the first Casefiles. Sadly, and oddly, the book only covers seasons 3 and 4. WG 3 managed to fit in the final season, and Nikki Stafford's excellent \\"Once Bitten\\" did too, so why not this one?. Hmm. Included here are the always welcomed \\"Character Bios\\", something lacking in WG 3. It goes through all the major players, and most of the recurring players thru the two seasons. They also have \\"Actor Profiles\\" as well. They do make some mistakes. Such as saying that Connor, in the character bio part, was 18 when he came back, when he was actually 16. Although they do change it in the actual episode guides. They also mention the song \\"Lady Marmelade\\", and say it was by Aretha Franklin, when it was by Patti LaBelle. The episode guides are always the main focus of these books, and the authors don't disappoint. With long, detailed synopses of each episode, they bring the same categories and facts and such with each ep as they always do. The episodes, like the first book, are designed as actual case files. What are they?. Every episode summary is titled \\"Action Taken\\". We have \\"Dossiers\\", which is a section that informs of who the client, clientele, or outside support is(if there is any in a particular episode)that they deal with. Then there is \\"Continuity\\", which deals with the ongoing story and arcs and historythat the show has come from. \\"Quote Of The Wek\\" is pretty self explanatory. No need to go into that one further. \\"The Devil Is In The Details\\" portion has \\"Expenses\\", which shows pretty much what you'd expect. \\"Weaponry\\" tells exactly what kind of weapon was used, or if it was a weapon at all. \\"The Plan\\" is basically what the gang's, well, plan is for this episode's situation. \\"Demons, ETC....\\" is a section dealing with what kinds of ghouls ans goblins, if any, were seen in that particular episode. And there is a handful more, like \\"Tracks\\", which is for music featured in the episode. \\"The Final Cut\\" which is things that didn't make it to the end episode. \\"As Scene In L.A.\\" is stuff from Angel's city. \\"Pop Culture\\" is pretty much saying it there in the title. \\"The Name Game\\" tells about the meaning of an episode's title. \\"Six Degrees Of...\\" is basically a \\"Where Have I Seen Them Before?\\" thing, and a few more. There are also interviews and little tid bits from cast and crew about that particular episode in the guides as well. The episodes are finely detailed and the format for each episode in the casefile way is fun and clever. Afterwards, there is a section called \\"The Changing Face Of Evil\\", which is a look at the new design and sets for Wolfram & Hart. And season five doesn't go entirely unnoticed, as there is a section towards the end which gives an overview on what happened. Wether or not we see something on season five in a AC 3 is unclear and not mentioned, and that is this book's one sore spot. I doubt there will be another book for one season. It wouldn't fill a book. If there isn't anything, it would be Angel getting the short end of the stick again. Like The WG's, this book also comes with two sections of photos, all in glorious color. If anybody was upset with Ruditis' work on WG 3, then you should know that this book pretty much stays on course with first book, and makes WG 3 seem all the more like a wasted opportunity. This one is not.	2004-12-25
US	42265449	R17XNADT7JGC1H	0395957893	474809806	Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy Tipton	Books	5	6	7	N	N	Who Are You?	It's safe to say that there is another side to most of us. No matter who you are, or how big or little it is, or how serious. There is something there that we don't tell others. But the lies and deception in this book from the man/woman it comes from, top it all. The book details the life of respected jazz musician, Billy Lee Tipton. A bright, funny, good natured and handsome young man, who wanted nothing more than to play the music he loved and to have a career doing it. Sounds nice, right?. Billy was born Dorothy Tipton. A she. From the age of 19 up until his death at the age of 74 in 1989, Dorothy had lived as a man. Billy. The writer of this fine and incredible biography, Diane Wood Middlebrook, can't easily answer most of the questions that anyone who knows the story or reads the book will want to know. Why?. Mainly because there is no real way of knowing. Billy Tipton was an incredible mystery. A mystery that the man himself only had the answers too, and he kept them with him when he went to the grave. Only Billy knows why he did it, and he never let it out. Sure, there were some who kind of had an idea along the way, and some who did know, but nothing came of it. The questions his story raise can only be met with ideas and suggestions of the author, and our own viewpoint. The book goes into detail how this man lived and worked. The details of the gigs he would play around the country. The most interesting thing here is that he was able to have five wives!. And according to them, they never knew anything. I have always known the story and it would be appealing and interesting no matter what, but I have a strong connection to it since Billy spent the last 26 or 27 years of his life here in my hometown. Billy's sexuality is the most mysterious. He went for real women, so was she really a lesbian?. What were her thoughts and wants?. No one knows. And why did she do it?. Some say that because back when she was growing up, women were in the background. Men up front. Women had their parts, and the men went off and did the work. There were some women who may of been in groups and what not, but a lot of them were background singers. Some lucky few broke thru the barriers and had solo careers. So did Billy do it so he could actually get a break in the business he wanted in to play the music he loved?. Who knows. It's an odd and infuriating tale since Billy is still a gigantic question mark at the end just as much as he was in the beginning. Middlebrook writes with such a deep understanding and respect for Tipton, and she makes it such an absorbing and compelling read. You could read the whole thing in one day if you wanted too. It's that good. From his stormy upbringing, to his bizarre adult and senior life, Middlebrook creates a brilliant book about a most peculiar and sensational person. A must read.	2004-12-11

But when they are as good, fun, and interesting as Nikki Stafford's book on the subject are, they are a most welcomed treat. When she released the Buffy book, \\"Bite Me\\", a few years back, it was a refreshing read since it was from a fan. It was well written and researched, and although I had some questions with some of her ongoing nitpicks, it was a fantastic book. The problems I had with it?. Basically, season 4. Most fans were turned off and grossed out with the Cordelia/Connor thing, and the stuff Cordelia did. And Stafford even keeps referring to it as being Cordelia. The thing is, it is not Cordelia. She isn't doing these things. Charisma didn't change everything she built for the character as Stafford writes, because this is a whole other person using her. People didn't distiguish the two, and I think it made for some of the fabulous, brilliant stuff that season 4 had going for it to be overlooked and not given the proper treatment. This wasn't Cordelia. If the real Cordelia had heard of what happened, she would of been just as grossed out as everyone else. Probably even more so. Stafford keeps up the momentum with this latest release on the history and series run of Buffy's sister show, \\"Angel\\". Stafford keeps the fun and interest high all through the well made book, and her own personal thoughts and nitpicks are still there, and while some may annoy some people, are still interesting and fun to read. They are also not important enough to give a low grade to this book. That's forgetting the great stuff inside and giving it a low mark because you don't like the cover. The recent \\"Watcher's Guide Vol. 3\\" was such a disappointing affair, that it makes one happy for a Whedonverse book like this one to come along. Stafford keeps things fresh and makes it very clear in the beginning that she is not going to re-hash what she had already written about Angel in the \\"Bite Me\\" book, and she doesn't. Her writing is well rounded and easy to read, where some more scholary type publications can get a little over done. To please even more readers and fans, and to tie up loose ends, she has also included the seventh and final season of \\"Buffy\\" at the end of book as well. What also makes this book a better deal is that she includes season 5 of \\"Angel\\". The recently released \\"Angel Casefiles Vol. 2\\" only goes to season 4. What's that about?. The book has very long, in detail synopses and thoughts of all 110 episodes of the show over it's 5 season run. Every section comes with a few little different categories too. Just like the \\"Bite Me\\" book. She has \\"Highlight\\", which as you probably know, tells what she thought was the high point of that particular episode. There is \\"Interesting Facts\\", which you can pretty much guess on your own. \\"Did You Notice?\\" is a section where she tells things that one may have not noticed or really picked up on. The infamous \\"Nitpick\\" section I already mentioned. \\"The Buffy Connection\\" is a section that tells if a certain episode or moment or part of a story in that episode has ties with something from \\"Buffy\\". There is also a \\"Woops\\" part that details bloopers and all that. It's all very well researched and startingly crafted. If that isn't enough, she has sections on the 2003 Posting Board party, \\"Angel\\" and \\"Buffy\\" on the web, some trivia, an interview with Alexis Denisoff(Wesley), the story of Angel, some nice color photos, and a section on Buffy in the academia world. Stafford delivers another fine book on the subject that is nothing but pure fun and enjoyment from start to finish. Even though it's not \\"Buffy\\", it is everything that \\"Watcher's Guide 3\\" should have been. The world and stories of \\"Angel\\" was a marvelous, brilliant place, and Stafford keeps the glory of the show alive with this fine book. One wonders what she will give us next, while at the time it's sad that the Buffy/Angel world is over and we won't get another fine book on the two from her. Oh well. Read and enjoy, because the book is every bit as good as \\"Bite Me\\". Well done.	2004-12-03

When I think of my favorite Christmas moments, it all pretty much has to do with The Parker Family. Not Natalie Wood sitting on Santa's lap at the mall, or Jimmy Stewart running through his snowy town wishing everyone a Merry Christmas. But giant pink bunny costumes, a scary Santa with a big sled, a father battling the furnace, and of course, a Red Ryder BB gun. We have all come to love and appreciate the Christmas classic, \\"A Christmas Story\\", released back in 1983. With little fanfare in the beginning, it has grown over the years to match, and maybe outdo, yearly favorites like \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\". This book, a collection of the works of Jean Shepherd, is what inspired the now beloved movie. I have never read it before, and I was quite surprised with how different it was. I wasn't expecting most of it. All of the little things in the movie we know and love, were not actually part of the original story. They were all seperate stories of their own, and most never even took place during the holidays. The first story, \\"Duel In The Snow, Or Red Ryder Nails The Cleveland Street Kid\\", is basically the Red Ryder Christmas tale we all know. There were some surprising differences, but I will let you find those out yourself. The second is, \\"The Counterfeit Secret Circle Member Gets The Message, Or The Asp Strikes Again\\", and this short story is all about the Little Orphan Annie and the decoder ring. Something that was put into the actual movie. The third story is, \\"My Old Man And The Lascivious Special Award That Heralded The Birth Of Pop Art\\", which is the infamous tale of Mr. Parker and his questioable leg lamp. The fourth is, \\"Grover Dill And The Tasmanian Devil\\", which tells the tale of the neighborhood bully, who was renamed Scut Farkas for the movie. The fifth and final story in the book is \\"The Grandstand Passion Play Of Delbert And The Bumpus Hounds\\", a story about The Parkers' hillbilly neighbors, and their unruly pack of dogs. The book, and Shepherd's writing and immaculate way of spinning a yarn, is so drenched in Americana and nostalgia, that you can definiltey imagine the whole thing in your head and feel as if you are there. You can actually see Ralphie's eyes, or any other of the characters. He writes with such a sure, warm hand, that it feels as if he is writing directly to you and that you could of been a part of this. If that makes any kind of sense at all. It will surprise many when you read the book and find out that things were not originally written like it is in the movie. Shepherd wrote the script to the movie, and when he did, probably to make it movie length, he incorporated the stories of Little Orphan Annie, the leg lamp, the bully, and The Bumpus hounds, into the script, and wove it into a coherent and sensible script. Thank god he did. Can you imagine the movie today without any of those side stories?. I don't think so. I also find it interesting that the parents are always 'Mom' and 'The Old Man'. Fans might be disappointed with some things that were changed for the movie. And changed for the better. For instance, the pink bunny costume was originally just a pair of slippers. Slippers? funny. Big pink bunny costume?. Very funny!!. And other things. Still, it is a warm and brilliant display of writing that will warm the heart on the coldest, and snowiest, day of the season. Perfect to own, and to be cherished year after year. Same with the movie.	2004-11-04
US	42265449	RCGQS35FP58F4	0440242576	999720718	Skipping Christmas	Books	5	2	2	N	N	It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year	I have never read John Grisham before, but I found it interesting that he would write a comical, holiday book. It suits him. Grisham is a brilliant writer, and he writes characters that are so real, you instantly can picture someone you know, or know of, in the part. They are real. So is this book. With Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis starring in the lead roles in the upcoming movie, I could only picture them. If people find it obvious and too normal, then that's the point. This is life. The story centers on Luther and Nora Krank, a middle aged couple that are sending their only child, 23 year old graduate student Blair, off to Peru to work with the Peace Corps. With the holidays coming, and Luther realizing that they spent $6,100 on Christmas last year, he devises a plan. With Blair gone, he suggests they skip Christmas this year, and by saving that money, treat themselves to a 10 day cruise to the Caribbean. No tree, no lights, no decorations, no cards, no annual party, no nothing. With the close knit neighborhood that embraces the festivities with carolers, parades, and an amazing light display, and police officers and firefighters collecting donations for charity, the Kranks learn that foregoing the holiday is tougher than they thought. Then Blair calls, and everything is thrown into a tailspin. I won't say more. Grisham has a keen sense of detail for the spirit of the season, and all the chaos and craziness that goes with it. He tackles the hectiness of it by showing off all the rushing to and fro, and gift buying, and the lunacy of it all. What kind of bothered me was the community's reaction to their plans. It was like they commited a crime. I love Christmas, and can't do without it, but I can see Luther's point. Why can't anyone see the logic behind it?. The book is screamingly funny, because it all comes from truth. Some of it might seem like it was written to up the humor and wackiness of it all, but so what?. The ending is something else. Some people here have had problems with the overdone ending. So?. This is a story. It's just a book. The ending is warm and gives that nice feeling that in this day and time, is most welcome to see. Or read. Or hear about. The book is filled with some colorful characters. Most of them the neighbors. Vic Frohmeyer, the neighborhood nazi, who takes care of everything. And there are more. They are all interesting and vivid, because Grisham writes each character out. They are fully developed and written, and have their own personality and traits. They can be anybody. The book may not be in the classic category with stories like \\"A Christmas Carol\\", or any number of favorite holiday films, but it is genuinely charming, witty, and full of humanity, that it should develop a following that will place it in the yearly holiday fun. John Grisham, this may not be the norm of what you write, but I found it to be refrshingly real, honest, and above all, entertaining. You could read it all in one day if you wanted too, but why not stretch it out to prolong the fun?. Can't wait for the movie. Merry Christmas!.have had problems with the overdone ending. So?.

US	42265449	R3LC1BNAI7IYRO	0689869843	198914586	The Watcher's Guide, Volume 3 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Fangs For The Memories	Well, Like others here, I was slightly disappointed when I got the book and saw what was in it. Or more importantly, what wasn't in it. I was a bit concerned from the get go when I first heard that Nancy Holder wasn't involved. That was a red flag right there. Needless to say, the concern was warranted. Still, after reading the book and thinking about it, it is still a good book. A very nicely put together book that is well written and researched. Author Paul Ruditis, who I have never even heard of, does a fantastic job on the episode guide and all the usual things that come with it. Is it as bad as all the negative reviews for it say?. No way!. Does Ruditis get the knowledge and research wrong?. Nope. The book is not, in any way, shape, or form, what the negatives say it is. I think people were just disappointed with what was not included here. And yes, it is sad, but there is still fine work here and is a good read. It may not be essential like the other 2, but is still good to have. No question about it. That is why I gave the book four stars. Like volumes 1 and 2, the big part of the book is the expected episode guide. This volume packs in the most seasons with seasons 5, 6, and 7, while the first two only had two seasons at a time. Each episode comes with the usual stuff that were included in the first two. There isn't much of a difference there. The episode summary is quite lengthy(well, lengthy enough) and well thought out and explained. The quote of the week is there as well as the &quot;Love In Vein&quot; part, which deals with the ongoing love lives of our favorite Scooby Gang. Ruditis even added a new little thing of his own. It is called &quot;Dramatis Personae&quot;, and it is a little tidbit about the history and lives of the gang as well. Thankfully, we still get two sections of really goos colored photos too. The essays are interesting and would of been more appreciated if they weren't the only other section in the book. The one on the journey of thecharacter of Jonathan is the best and is very well written and a nice tribute to the character. The rest are all well written and fun and interesting to read. The editors wanted something different for the book than the usual stuff, but we the fans want what we want. Not what the editor thinks we want. There is no character bio like in the first two. No interviews with anyone and no sections on make-up or just the making of the show. This is what has come to be cornerstones of these books, but they are not here at all. With Holder bowing out of &quot;Angel : Casefiles Volume 2&quot; and Ruditis doing that one two, it should make fans even more worried.	2004-07-31
US	42265449	R11L1PH8RYGSG5	1932273271	506236652	Friends 'Til the End: The Official Celebration of All Ten Years	Books	4	93	97	N	N	The One With The Book	10 years. 10 years is a long time indeed. Plenty of time to get to know smelly cats, ugly naked guys, yettis, and a certain Miss Chanadler Bong. When all is said and done, this show about a group of six friends had just as many little quirks and infamous characters and situations(likes the ones mentioned above)as that other NBC behemoth, \\"Seinfeld\\".  Looking back at the pictures through the seasons and re-discovering the moments when you first met Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Joey, is quite special. Remembering and reminiscing why you liked and fell in love with everything about it in the first place. This book, in celebration with the \\"Friends\\" finale, is a nice little keepsake to have as a lasting little nod to the sitcom. Very few shows have the success and longevity that the show had. All the media hype, attention, and of course, the hair do's you just gotta have!. I don't know why it says it's just being released now as I have had my copy for almost a month now. There has yet to be a real book on the \\"Friends\\" legacy, and this one isn't it. However, I don't think that were it's intentions. Written by David Wild, who I believe is(or was)a music journalist for Rolling Stone, the book goes over the show and seasons in photos. Photos galore. There are interviews with each cast member, Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox Arquette, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer. They talk about when they first got the show, and the reaction soon afterwards, and the ups and the downs and the struggles and the backlash and now, the ending. It would of been nice to get sections on the people who were in the supporting/recurring cast throughout the show's run. People like Gunther, Janice, The Geller's, and so on. I guess the original Chick and Duck were probably too busy. While this book probably didn't have any aspiration to be the treasure trove companion piece that we still don't have, it satisfies for what it is. That about does it for the written part. The photos are bright and vibrant and they seem to of picked the best of the best. Most of the choices for every season section showcase the best, funniest, saddest, and most important moments. Re-living and remembering some of these events through the pictures are fun and nostalgic. There are a few sections that have some lines from the show about love and friendship and the like. It would be nice to actually get a companion book to the show, but this will most definitley due until it gets here. There's not much else to say except that it's a book for the fans to remember and cherish their best friends.	2004-05-07
US	42265449	R3EA89LZ6JS837	0809222272	343297562	The Hollywood Book of Death: The Bizarre, Often Sordid, Passings of More than 125 American Movie and TV Idols	Books	5	88	91	N	N	Grave Matters	Celebrities. There has always been an incredible fascination with the ins and outs of a celebrity and everything that goes with it. It's been that way for decades and decades. While some may be interested in what they do or spend, nothing is more interesting and fascinating than the tale of a star who's time has come and gone and are no longer with this. This decent sized book tells the tale of over 125 celebrities who have passed on to that big silver screen in the sky. Some big names, some you have probably never heard of before in your life. The big name stars that are featured in this book like Mary Pickford, W.C. Fields, River Phoenix, Bela Lugosi, Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard, and a ton of others, are always interesting to read about. But it is the people you are not familiar with that comes across as more intriguing. The book is divided into a couple of different categories dealing with the way of death. There is the first section, &quot;Accidental Deaths&quot;, which is pretty much self explanatory. People in this section include Sonny Bono, Grace Kelly, Brandon Lee, and a dozen others. Then there is the &quot;Alcohol And Drugs&quot; section, where such celebs as Belushi, Barrymore, Farley, and Holden among others will be found. There is &quot;In Obscurity&quot;, a section with lesser known performers, although Martha Raye is in here along with Clara Bow and Hedy Lamarr. This section deals with entertainrs who, well, went into obscurity. The book rounds out with &quot;Murders&quot;, &quot;Natural Causes&quot;, which does have a lot of people in it but does not fill up the  book at all like an earlier review said. Plus, there is &quot;Puzzling Deaths&quot; and &quot;Suicides&quot;. Some entertainers get a lenghty enough tribute, while some others don't. But I found each one to be appropriate to the level of star they were talking about and gave as good enough of information as there needed to be. There were definitley some doozies in here in regards to the person themself and their demise. Their is definitley bizarre and sordid stories in here as the title of the book says. While some may of died of old age or some other kind of natural cause, there is still usually enough interesting things and facts written about them that still makes it worthwhile, even when the ones that died normally, well, died normally. Plus you get fun little tall tales about people like John Barrymore. As legend has it, his body was borrowed from the morgue and taken back to Errol Flynn's house by his buddies and propped up making it look as though he didn't die. This, of course, sent Errol running out of the house. There are a few odds and ends like that here and there, and it's part of the fun that this book has between it's pages. The author, James Parrish, put together a nice and interesting book that is sure to be eaten up by any fan intrigued by the subject. I know I was.	2004-04-11
US	42265449	R3JBIVAY05NO6A	0689866992	325602474	Monster Island (Buffy the Vampire Slayer\Angel) (Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Monster Mash	\\"Monster Island\\" is only the second book in the Buffy/Angel series of books to have been originally released in hardback. The only other one was the Buffy book, \\"Immortal\\". Why this is, I don't know, but I got the just released paperback. The tale is written by one of the premiere handlers of Buffy fiction, Christopher Golden. He co-wrote it with Thomas E. Sniegpski. One knows that the characters are going to be handled well and written for accordingly with Golden involved. This is a Buffy/Angel crossover novel, and the best one to do so so far. The story is large and quite epic. Someone, or something, is killing of half breed demons in Sunnydale at an alarming rate. A ways away in the City Of Angels, the same thing is happening there. Angel realizes that the connection strikes a lot closer to home and soon Buffy and her gang are in L.A. to fight alongside Angel and his compadres. The character of Doyle, who figured prominently in the first 8 episodes of \\"Angel\\", is part of the plot and it's a most welcome connection. The big finale takes place on a magical island filled with all sorts of races of demons. Buffy and the others must fight the great evil before thousands of half breeds are slaughtered. The meshing of the two worlds just runs smoothly here. It always does, but this one has almost everyone getting together, except for Giles, Anya, and Dawn. The characters are all written as they would be on the show by the most knowing of standards. There are demons galore here, and just may be one of the most demon packed series in the franchise.  I can't tell you when it is placed, as in what seasons, because there is no information on that given. Buffy talks about being brought back from the dead, which would mean season 6. But there is a point in the book where Wesley says they had just broke Faith out of jail, which happened in season 4 of \\"Angel\\", which ran during season 7 of \\"Buffy\\", but there is no Connor, who was a regular member during season 4 of \\"Angel\\", anda couple characters visit the ruins of Sunnydale High, which was restored in season 7 of \\"Buffy\\", so who knows when it actually takes place. Did anyone follow that?. There's a number of things here and there that a Buffy/Angel fan would remember and get. Sure to put a smile on your face. The story is one of the strongest in the line of books, and is written solidly with a sharp eye for detail and characterization. Each individual series of books, Angel and Buffy, keep getting better and better. And when they crossover like this, it's just pure golden. Christopher, that is.	2004-03-22

It's acting. Direction. Effects. Make-up. And, oh, just about everything else. But what stands tall the most is the writing. The pain. The love. The humor. The horror. The adventure. The action. It has been widely praised for it's entire seven season run as one of the best, smartest, and most cleverly written show on TV. And rightfully so. The show could do a punch line or a joke better than any other show, and pretty much most sitcoms. It could make you bust a gut, think, cry, or any other kind of emotion. And so, it is only fitting that the genius of the show's writing and it's best dialogue get it's due with it's own book. Sadly, the end result, this book, isn't the holy grail of \\"Buffy\\" writing that one would of hoped. It is pretty cheaply done and seems to of been sput out rather fast and without much thought or care for the finished product. It's a short book, and one you could probably read in one sitting. It gives you the lines and who said them and in what episode and that's that. The book and it's creators should of taken a lesson from the two \\"Watcher's Guide\\" books and been more creative. They should of threw in different categories, explained situations about where the dialogue came from and what the situation was, and so on. There are many lines in here that I don't see any reason for being included, and some that I loved that were not here. It's a colorless, humanless book that could of used some pictures as well. I guess it's okay for what it is, and will be satisfactory for now, until someone along the way realizes that the writing and it's best dialogue deserve something better than this chintzy little book. It's original purpose was great, but the way they did it was half fisted and probably not worth the money for the real fans. It is just fine for newbies, but otherwise, I didn't find it to be what I wanted it to be and what it should of been.	2004-03-10

With what happens in this latest entry in the Buffy book world, it is fitting. Characters in this book are torn apart and turn on each other. There is probably nothing worse than that. A person's greatest fear would be to have the ones you love and trust turn on you in a way that you fear for your life and what the very people you once loved and trusted with your life will do to you. That is exactly what Buffy is fearing here. Authors Scott and Denise Ciencin have crafted an in-depth and intelligent epic of a story that ties in very nicely with the Buffy universe and it's characters. The story, according to the authors, takes place during the sixth season of the show. A season that was already dark enough. Buffy is running herself into the ground with new chaos that is taking over Sunnydale. She is getting weird, mysterious messages in the weirdest of forms from someone named Simon. These messages have Buffy running to solve the puzzle and to find different kinds of monsters each time and putting together parts of what is called a \\"soul sword\\", and tries to learn of it's use before it falls into the wrong hands and creates even more chaos. At the same time, the others in town are being affected by a strange virus that is running rampant through town. No one is safe, and it turns especially dangerous when it hits the ones closest to Buffy. Her friends Willow and Xander, and her own little sister, Dawn, who is involved a great deal in this story. What happens is a wild adventure that has Buffy turning to the last people(?)on earth she would normally turn to for help when it seems that she has no one else. While the book has an epic like story, the book itself has an epic like length that feels like it might go on a tad too long than it really needs to. It's characterizations and dialogue is in sync with the show and the characters themselves. However, as I said above, the authors say it takes place in the sixth season, but this seems to be impossible since Principal Woods appears in this story, and he doesn't come on the show until season seven. Whoops. The work on Willow and Xander is also well done. They are both looking for some kind of direction in their life. Some kind of purpose. Xander thinks he is making it big in construction and has met a great new client, but it doesn't turn out that way. Things go wrong for Willow in school too. The end climax is a little odd and seems to be a little too extreme even for a book where the imagination can run even more freely than the show itself, which is on a constricted budget. Still, it is a wild and epic adventure that showcases some true elements of excitement, horror, humor, and emotion. A great ride.	2004-01-29
US	42265449	R3KIYHLRSOJSGZ	068986437X	332146319	Cursed (Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel)	Books	4	11	12	N	N	City Of Angels....And Spike	After having read a great deal of most of the Buffy novels that have been released over the years, I have never written a review for one. Why now then?. Well, this isn't a typical \\"Buffy\\" book. In fact, the Buffster is nowhere to be found in the book at all, save for a few mentions here and there and her voice on the phone on the last page. No, this brings Angel and Spike together in a crossover book for the first time. We must also think author Mel Odom for doing so. While Spike is now currently annoying Angel on his fantastic WB show, that has not happened as of yet in this book. The book apparently takes place during Buffy's 5th season and Angel's 3rd. I am guessing that the author is messing with the series' continuity because otherwise he has made some things happen that do not coincide with the time this story presumably takes place. Spike, sulking around Sunnydale after a falling out with Buffy, comes across a job that is offered to him. He is asked to participate with a bunch of demons in a robbery in Los Angeles. Angel territory. It will pay him money and he is desperatley looking for cash for his own intentions, and to help Buffy, who he wants to help with her finances and also hopes will forgive him for the gesture of helping her out. Spike agrees and he heads to L.A. Angel, and his circle of friends, Cordelia, Wesley, Gunn, Fred, and Lorne, are on a mission to secure a mystical object that is being shipped into the city thanks from a tip from Giles. Little do each vampire know that they are both after the same thing as the object is exactly what Spike and his demon gang are supposed to rob. After some situations, the two vamps come face to face and realize that they must work together to get the job done. There is much more to it, but that would be getting into too much. Spike is the only character from the \\"Buffy\\" world to actually appear in the book, so it's more of an \\"Angel\\" novel. Odom has his people down pat. His Spike is the Spike at that particular time and place, and so is Angel and his environment. The numerous flashbacks scenes to the 1800's that take place in different locations, and also include Darla and Drusilla, are stunningly done, and thoroughly re-created. The flashbacks are always my favorite things because they are always so rich with history. These ones don't disappoint. Odom writes these characters, their situations, and the environment they are in with a knowing hand. The commeraderie, or lack thereof, between Angel and Spike, makes it feel like the real thing. His way of writing the other members of Angel's crime fighting team are right on the money as well. Like I said before, this takes place in an alternate continuity of Buffy's 5th and Angel's 3rd, seasons, and it would have to be because as I mentioned, things in here don't connect with what has, or is, going on at that point in time in both series. Still, this is a slam bang book dripping with fascinating details, flashbacks, history, and character development. One of the better entries in the Buffy/Angel arsenal. Every fan should enjoy this one.	2004-01-25
US	42265449	R60BF0FZUR91L	0671041789	867268465	The Green Mile	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Healing Hands	The work of Stephen King can be touch and go at times. More or less, he nails it every time. Especially th 70's and 80's classics that represent his best work. And while his books that are about killers, ghosts, and various other types of horiffic types of characters are crazy and fun and impeccably written, it's his quiter books that are about people and mostly character driven type stories that come off as his most satisfying because of his incredible ability to write characters. To create them, to give them a voice, and to make them real. Ones that might have fantastical elements to them in some way, but are more about reality. \\"Dolores Claiborne\\" comes to mind. And that is what he delivers with series of \\"Green Mile\\" books. A mini-series of books?. It was a novel and fun idea, but one that has not been done much in recent times. I can say that from reading the first book, you are as hooked as you always are with any other Stephen King release. I could not wait for the next chapter to come out and usually read them in a day or two. The series is that good and that compelling. It's very much character based and character driven. It takes place down in the south in a prison, Cold Mountain Penitentiary, in 1932. The writing describing the south and getting the talk and dialogue down for that part of the country was on the mark by King. The narrator of the story is an old man in present time who is resinding in a rest home. He is prison guard, Paul Edgecomb, and through his tale we meet him back in 1932 as well as his fellow guards. One of whom stands out far more than all the others. A certain guard named Percy Wetmore. An oily, sniveling rat that seems no better than some of the inmates.  The tale takes place in E block and is filled with odd characters. Characters who are waiting out their time until it is time for them to walk that finale mile. The Green Mile. Inmates like William Wharton, who has been dubbed as \\"Billy The Kid\\", is a sad sack criminal who has lost it. And we cannot forget Mr. Jingles. Who exactly is someone that would have that name?. Well, I'll let you find that one out on your own. One inmate in particular, John Coffey, stands out. Charged with murder, Edgecomb and the others around him soon learn that Mr. Coffey, a moountain of man, has a special gift. A gift that can help and heal others. What comes of this is if this man really is innocent and was trying to help the very people he was charged of killing, or if he simply lost control and is guilty as charged. King creates supporting characters that are as memorable as always and gives incredible moments, that are either big or small, but memorable nonetheless. There is one nasty part of the serial that happens, and it is the only time in the moment when King goes for the shock and gore that pop up in his other books. It is intelligently written, beautifully told, and memorable. Take the time to walk this mile.	2004-01-25

The two authors, especially one of them, is known as a major Elton historian. Why then, did he make the mistake?. The error in question is this - In describing the &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; album, it was stated that &quot;Rocket Man&quot; and &quot;Honky Cat&quot;, the two singles off the album, were Elton's first top 10 singles?. Uh, sorry, but wrong. 2 years prior to this record, &quot;Your Song&quot; was a top 10 hit on the Billboard single charts. How can such a big historian make that mistake?.	2004-01-05

At first thought, many people probably would have thought director Wes Craven to be some kind of unbalanced oddball because of some of the films he has made. Not to mention some of the gnarly and overly violent scenes he has created in his numerous films. What kind of a person would of made \\"The Last House On The Left\\", or \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\"?. Or have a geiser of blood shooting up from a teenaged boy's bed in the original \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\"?. Well, Mr. Craven. That's who. Newbies just finding his work and learning more about him, might be surprised to find that Mr. Craven is the exact opposite of what you would of thought. Instead of coming across as some crazy horror film director, he comes across more as a polished and highly intelligent man who looks and dresses like a college professor. \\"Freddy\\" star Robert Englund even once made that comment after meeting Wes for the first time after auditioning for the first Freddy movie. This book delves right into the entirety of Wes' career and offers glimpses into the makings of each ones, not to mention his own life. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio on August 2, 1939. One other interesting note was how his family were a deeply religious baptist family. The religion and the nature of his family's religion is something Wes goes on to discuss a bit further in the book. It's also incredibly interesting to know that Wes never saw a movie until <BR>he wasin college. The good and the bad from his work is brought to the forefront and dissected. A running theme thru the book is the effect that horror, and many of Wes' films, have had on the world. Is it good?. Is it harmful to children?. Is it responsible when someone commits a crime and says they did because of watching \\"Scream\\" or any other movie?. That is some of the interesting bits you will read about in this book. Author Brian J. Robb, an autobiogrpaher who has done work on such other people as Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, River Phoenix, and Leonardo DiCaprio, does a nice job of getting the information there and making it easily accessible and interesting to read. Granted, the book isn't entirely perfect. It's a thin and light book that could probably be read in one sitting. Also, many of the quotes seem like they were taken from many other sources. It doesn't feel like Wes had directly talked to this book or was involved in any interviews for it. I'm just guessing. It would of been better if it had a tad more in depth, but I'm not really complaining for as it is a great book. The \\"Nightmare On Elm Street\\" films are thoroughly researched and talked about here. It is kind of odd that every single one is accounted for since 4 of them had nothing really to do with Wes at all. I did get the feeling that Wes wasn't properly treated at time by New Line over the \\"Elm Street\\" series. These films were what really made Wes known, until a little movie called \\"Scream\\" came out to terrify theatergoers in 1996 and made Wes not only a household name again, but proved that he is master and back at the top of the horror list. Much talk and detail goes into all 3 of the \\"Scream\\" films as well. Overall, this is avery entertaining and enjoyable read. From his trouble with getting a film done, going without money, and the ever present cencorships board, and other things you will read about in this book, Wes Craven has had his struggles. But as always, he rolls with the punches and he always gets back on his feet again. This is a book that satisfy fans, newcomers to him and his work, and genre buffs all over the world.	2003-12-13

I have to say that most of the negative reviews for this book are way, way off course. They pretty much say that Spike isn't Spike as he was in season six, as when this book was placed, and that author Nancy Holder doesn't know what she is doing. Ms. Holder is the premiere Buffy book author. You better believe she knows what she is doing. The awkwardness that existed between Buffy and Spike, the confusion that Buffy felt for him, and the making love aspect of it, is all there. What book were those people reading?. What season did they see?. Obviously, they are not well tuned Buffy fanatics. If they were, they would of seen that season six Spike was there. And the story that went on with him and Buffy is definitley here. The negative bashing saying otherwise is beyond ridiculous with no solid proof to back it up. Anyways, this is a real nice, dandy of a book. When I first heard that it would be of Jack The Ripper and Spike and Buffy, excitement grew. There are flashbacks galore as we go back to the 1880's London with Spike, Angelus, Dru, and Darla, and a creepy monstrosity that is Jack The Ripper. I won't say who or what he is. I will save that for you. A mysterious fog has come and enveloped Sunnydale. Unlike any fog anyone has ever seen. It brings a strange presence, known only as Jack, to the town. He is looking to open the hellmouth and destroy mankind. The descriptions of old London and the time is very good. The accents and language are spot on. Present day Buffy parts are very well done. Then again, it's Holder. She knows what to do and how to do it. It is a very entertaining read, and it feels like Buffy. Most of all, all of the season six traits are there and done appropriatley. This is one of the better adult Buffy books in a while. All fans should enjoy this.	2003-07-05

The one star review lower on this page got it right. The facts that Mr. Allen gave as the boy's identity, his father, and where this all happened are all dead wrong. Nothing ever happened in the town or house that he said it did. It was apparent that Mr. Allen did minimal digging into the subject and just took what he found and threw it on the page with nothing to back it up with. What's even odder about this is how easily the real information(from the &quot;Strange&quot; Magazine)was found by that reporter. That Mr. Allen didn't take enough time to see that what was in front of his face was horribly wrong and what was right was not hard to figure out. When Mr. Allen was even contacted by the other reporter, he seemed to not care or answer any questions as to why he didn't go further to find the real truth. Everything he has stated about the boy and the location, is all wrong. Even the possessed boy himself stated that he never lived there and didn't know why people thought that. While the book is an interesting read, it can only be categorized under 'fiction', because that is what it is.	2003-03-18

Who would of thought that a mediocre box office flop starring Kristy Swanson from 1992 would turn into such a brilliant, groundbreaking television show?. My guess is no one. This guide to the first two seasons of this show will go down as one of the best TV show guides ever assembled. Fans will treat it as if it were their own special bible. That said, this is the number one starting point to go too to get the info on the show, the characters, and all of the background you could want. Authors Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder(who both write book for 'Buffy')outdo themselves with one incredible job. Here is what this amazing book gives you. It gives you a complete guide to the first two seasons of shows. That's 34 episodes, since the first season was a mid season replacement of only 12 episodes instead of the usual 22. These sections give you the cast list for every episode, as well as a pretty in-depth description of each episode. You also get the \\"quote of the week\\" which has some of the best lines from that episode. There is \\"Love, Slayer Style\\" which tells you what, or any, romantic things pop up in the episode. There is a section called \\"Pop Culture I.Q.\\" which notes a line in the episode that would deal with something in, you guessed it, pop culture. \\"Buffy's Bag Of Tricks\\" tells what kinds of weapons or other things were used in the ep. \\"Continuity\\" details of things that are continued in an episode that were introduced in other episodes. Storylines, characters, or whatever. There are also times where they will includes dialogue from the original screenplay that wasn't used in the episode aired. You will also find little boxes with little bits and pieces of trivia and/or other interesting little facts. But before you get to the episode guide, you go through a little history of the town of Sunnydale. After that is the history of each character in the series, and that part ends with some choice dialogue moments from each character. The other important aspect to the show are the monsters. The demons. The vampires, and other nasties that lurk on this show. There is a 'Monster Guide' section that details the various beasties that have popped up in these first two seasons and given a little backstory on them as well. Anyone out there who is into the spells and chants and incantations on the show will be happy because there is a section talking about these three things and given snippets of chants and spells recited in the show. The other thing that runs rampant thru the show is love and relationships. There is a section called \\"Bloodlust\\" that deals with all of us. There are so many ups and downs in the 'love' department on this show, that those things could have a book all on it's own. The end of the book has biographies on the cast members and a brief interview with some of them. After the cast members, there are sections on crew members and some interviews with them. And if you like the music, the end of the book has the songs featured in every episode and tells you the name of the song and the name of the band/artist. If this isn't enough, there is also a nice helping of some great colored photos. This is a must have for anybody. Perfectly done and put together. The follow up, \\"The Watcher's Guide Vol.2\\" is the next step. It's even bigger and better than this one. I believe a \\"Vol. 3\\" will be out in the fall. Get this book. You can't go wrong. As perfect as they get.	2003-02-14
US	42265449	RVRXPY35N1RAW	0922915245	518997747	Ed Wood: Nightmare of Ecstasy (The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr.)	Books	5	6	9	N	N	Ed Wood's Hollyweird	Once you open the pages of this fine book, you are taken into the world of one interesting man and the wild and wacky and, ultimately, sad world he lived in. Of course, I'm talking about Edward D. Wood, Jr. This is the man who gave us \\"Bride Of The Monster\\", \\"Glen Or Glenda?\\", and the ultimate classic, \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", among others. There was no one else in the film business, or in the world, like Ed. This interesting, page turning book, by Rudolph Grey, is written in a much differnt way than the usual autobiography. The whole book, and Ed's whole story, is told in interviews from his friends, co-workers, wives, family, and even Ed Wood himself. This book, written in a different fashion, is very suiting to Ed, because he was quite different himself. Ed was accused of being the worst filmmaker in the world and made the worst films to ever be captured on film. Were they bad?. Yes. But you see, to Ed, they were masterpieces. This is what he wanted to do. Ed was just like any other person who dreamed of one day getting into the movie business and living his dream. He went to the movies all the time and even made his own. He was just like everybody else. Well, I guess not like EVERYONE else. Ed liked to wear angora sweaters and dress up in other women's clothing. He wasn't gay, it was just something he liked to do. The parts in the book dealing with how he got to like it and how he would ask and beg women for their angora items is funny. He was a real ladie's man. He loved them. He was married quite a few times. Besides Ed's life, the book also tells how the movie industry was and what it took to get movies made. Since Ed was a nobody and didn't have money, his movie making days were not the same as an actual star's. The book gives great insight into the art and money making side of the industry. Ed's struggles to find money and get his fillms made are intriguing. The guy might not of been a businessman or an all together competent filmmaker, but he knew what he wanted and how to get it. People might laugh nowadays about how cheep things looked, or how certain things were made out of any ordinary thing, but that was the genius of Ed. He was always thinking. In between shots he could make a tombstone or a coffin and have it ready to go. This is more inspirational than any young, hot shot director of today working with the top of line CGI effects. That may be cool and fun, but Ed was a real director. He made what he wanted. As with the usual 'infamous' type celebrity, the happy story quickly goes downhill. Ed's last years were awful and dreary. No money, no nothing, and no health. It was sad to see this guy who seemed to be filled with joy, even if everything he did was laughed at and ridiculed, turn into such a sad character. This is a book that will have you flipping to each page to read more about Ed's crazy life and his incredible time in the biz. This is a great book. Yoou need to get it.	2003-02-14

This is one book that they will definitley eat up with every page. After having been given a number of books about the show, it's cast, it's characters, and behind the scenes stuff, we get a book that solely concentrates on the other stars of this hit, groundbreaking show - the monsters. They definitley deserve their own book. It's only fair. Every type of monster that has appeared on the show in it's first 4 seasons are chronicled in this deeply researched book. Christopher Golden, author of the first \\"Watcher's Guide\\", and many 'Buffy' books, co-wrote this with Stephen Bissette, and Thomas Sniegoski. These guys really did their homework. Not only are you given the details and story of every monster on the show, you also get an in-depth history of the type of monster in popular culture. Anybody who is into that kind of thing will be drooling when they read this. The book is squared off into 9 different categories. You get \\"Demons\\", which detail characters like Moloch from \\"I Robot, You Jane\\", Machida from \\"Reptile Boy\\", Norman Pfister from \\"What's My Line 1 & 2\\", and many more. Then it's onto \\"Vampires\\". This section chronicles everyone from Angel to Spike to everyone else. \\"Magic Users\\" is pretty self explanatory. \\"Primals\\" deals with werewolves(Oz), Shape-shifters, and animal people. Next up is \\"Ghosts\\". No need to explain that one. \\"The Walking Dead\\" will tell you about zombies and reanimated corpses. Next we have \\"Bogeymen\\", which talk about everyone from The Gentleman in \\"Hush\\", to Der Kindestod in \\"Killed By Death\\", to Xander's clown in \\"Nightmares\\". After that is \\"Invisible People\\". Pretty much says everything. And finally, we are left with \\"Faith And The Human Monster\\". This may be the most interesting of the chapters. As you might of gotten from the title of the chapter, this section deals with people. Real people who are just...bad. It delves intothe awesome Faith character and storyline, as well as Prof. Walsh from Season 4, Gwendolyn Post from \\"Revelations\\", and a lot more. There you have it. It's a wonderful read into the background of the mosnters and other beasties and ghouls, and a great helping of where these types of monsters really came from. It's a delightful and interesting read that will no doubt please any fan. There are also some great colored photos in here as well. That only makes it better. One hopes that Mr. Golden and his team hurry up and give us \\"The Monster Book Vol. 2\\". There have certainly been enough for a second helping. Check this out and enjoy.	2003-02-13
US	42265449	RMF226N5QABSC	1550225405	729042759	Bite Me!: An Unofficial Guide to the World of Buffy the Vampire Slayer	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Fang - Tastic!	Okay, there are already a number of Buffy books dealing with the show that have been released ever since the show premiered in 1997. But, for some reason, we the fans keep snatching each new one up. More often than not, it's filled with stuff that most of us have probably already read a few times. However, each one has it's own surprises. This one is no different. This book is written by a fan for the fans. Nikki Stafford really knows her stuff. It's always interesting to hear critiques of episodes and story arcs and characters by a fan, instead of the usual critic. This one is a lot of fun to read. The book contains some things that other Buffy books haven't. Take for instance, the coverage of the first five posting board parties. That part is a lot of fun and makes you wish that you were there. There are the usual episode guides and summaries, but this one is the most up to date one on the shelves. This edition includes season six of ' Buffy' and season three of ' Angel '. Of course they are both halfway thru new seasons, but it's too soon for them. The Buffy section is way larger than the one on Angel. There is a lot more detail for the Buffy episodes. For each episode, Stafford tells you what songs played in the episode, who did them, and what CD they are from. There are also some brief biographies on the cast members of both \\"Buffy\\" and 'Angel\\". There is also an 'interesting fact' section that will tell you if there was something interesting about something or someone in that particular episode. Then there are two other sections called 'nitpick' and 'oops'. Now, Stafford obviously had a lot of time. The bloopers or inconsistencies she finds are mind boggling. The nitpicking she might have for a certain episode or a character can be questionable, and sometimes it's infuriating. It appears that the author had a hard time with Joyce(Buffy's mom)during season two and three. Like she had an agenda against her. This is where you might find some of Stafford's remarksuncalled for. Yes, Buffy has gone through a lot and she's only a 17 year old schoolgirl. But Joyce acts the way she should act. Wouldn't you be shocked as well as upset if you found out there are vampires and other beasties out in the world that can cause damage, pain, death, and destruction?. Not only that but your daughter is the slayer?. A person who fights all this and is constantly in dangerous, life threatening situations?. Not only that, but after defeating Angelus, telling her mother everything, Buffy vanishes. Disappears. Leaves town for moths. Again, Buffy went thru a lot. We can't imagine what it's like. But her friends and mother have every right to be angry and upset with her. It wasn't easy for Buffy at all, but she didn't exactly leave her friends and mother having a great time at Disneyland either. Okay. I got that off my chest. I just think her opinions on Joyce and her friends were unfair. There's more, but we won't get into that. It's too bad that she didn't give the same kind of attention to \\"Angel\\" in the episode guide section as she did with \\"Buffy\\". You get a summary, but no other special sections. That would of made an already fantastic book into a really fantastic book. Why it isn't included is quite puzzling. Maybe the next edition. There is also a really good quiz in here as well. You'd have to be really good to get a lot of these questions. There is also a small section of colored photos as well. The book is very balanced(although not according to a ridiculous review). It's a great addition to your Buffy shrine and will no doubt please every fan. It sure did please this fan. No matter what was missing or how it emphasized on other things when you thought it should be more on something else, it's still a great book. Any flaws here doesn't condemn it. a real fun read. Pick it up.	2003-01-01

This is a great, handy guide for horror fans. It has so many movies in here, and a ton of films that probably most people have never even heard of!. Probably some you wouldn't want to know of either. John Stanley has a lot of knowledge. He has a nice sense of humor in his reviews too. Now, I must comment on one star reviews below that will only give you a horrible impression of a fine book. These so-called 'reviews' give one star stating that there some mistakes in the book. Really stupid things like a certain monster in a 'Godzilla' didn't have wings or nonsense like this. This is not something to condemn a book for. Only uptight horror hounds with no lives will get into a snit over that. The only REAL mistake was how he mentioned Jason as the killer in the original 'Friday The 13th'. It was Jason's mother. The other thing was his rating system. People complain that a movie gets a mediocre review, but gets 3 stars. Well, his rating system goes up to five stars instead of the usual four. His three stars really translates into two stars. These were things that needed to be cleared up. Stay away from those reviews. This is a book that will not be far from a horror fan's reach.	2002-06-24

Anyone who calls themselves a fan will snatch this book up and devour every page. It's well written and nicely designed. Like the Buffy guide books, this one has two sections of colored pictures that have some real good pictures. Although this book doesn't delve into the day to day making of an episode like Buffy's last guide book, it's still good. Every episode for the first two seasons of the show are here in great detail. The sections seem even longer than they were in \\"The Watcher's Guide\\". Each section also comes with little categories like quotes and all that stuff that you have come to expect. The book is designed like, hence the title, a casefile. Every episode summary comes with a section telling you who the clients were in a particular episode and what became of them. It tells you if the Angel team received outside help from anyone. It also gives you the expenses that were used in every episode. The weapons they used, and the music heard in the episode. At the end of every summary, it tells you if the case was closed or not. The beginning of the books goes into great detail for every character on the show or has been on the show at one time or another. The end of the book deals with the bios of the actual actors themselves. If you are a fan, you probably pretty much already know their bios and history and all that. The book and it's designs inside are well done. More than the Buffy guides. The show has proven itself to be it's own being from \\"Buffy\\". It is a little darker and seedier than Buffy. Writer/Director/Producer/Creator Joss Whedon did the impossible when he spun off an incredibly successful show from another show. That doesn't happen too often. While Buffy continued to beat this show in it's first 2 seasons, this show has definitley found it's footing and it's strength this past year and was better than the Buffster. Author Nancy Holder, along with Jeff Marionette and Maryelizabeth Hart, are great writers who really pack everything in here. What more could a fan ask for?. Not much. Not much at all. I still don't think that this guide is as close to being as great as the two previous Buffy guides, especially the second one, but it does a good job anyways. This is essential for fans.	2002-06-15

With all of the Buffy related books out there covering this show and it's history, you would think there was nothing else left that could come out to catch your fancy. You would be wrong. This book, written by british author Keith Topping, is an insanely interesting and entertaining read. Every Buffy fan will surely be pleased with it. The book contains five seasons of the show(Sorry, no season six yet. Too early), with episode summaries of each episode. Each section of every episode summary also comes with a few other little segments describing each individual episode. There is - \\"Dudes And Babes\\", which tells if there are attractive people in this episode; \\"It's A Designer Label\\" which tells about the clothes characters were wearing and if they should of in the first place; \\"Valley Speak\\" which is all about the slang and lingo used in the show; \\"Cigarettes And Alcohol\\" which I'm sure you can guess on your own; \\"Logic, Let Me Introduce You To This Window\\" which is about goof ups and inconsistency problems; \\"Quotes\\" is about, you guessed it, quotes from the show; And there are a few other little categories that chime in including the author's final overview of the episode. This is a lot of fun. Topping really delves into every little detail. It's amazing. You don't know if you should be impressed with him or worry about him for having so much free time to catch every little detail. As I've mentioned, he is british and the book is a hoot to read when he talks about British and American things. Some of his comments on our culture is questionable, but not a whole lot. There are also a few comments about the show where he is talking about a screw up or an inconsistency that may be a little too picky, and can be easily answered with just common knowledge. Otherwise, he is right on the nose. Topping is obviously a fan. He can be harsh with some elements of certain episodes, but can enlighten others on subjects on certain episodes that they didn't get. The book would of benefited more if it had pictures. It doesn't. He also wrote a guide for 'Angel' called \\"Hollywood Vampire\\" that is also a great read and a must for any fan. All in all, a worthy entry in your Buffy shrine. Good job Keith Topping!.	2002-05-31

This guide to the TV series &quot;Angel&quot; is a british book by british author Keith Topping(who also did one for Buffy too called &quot;Slayer&quot;), and it's a good, well put together book. You will definitley have a great time with it. It is kinda funny to read it because it's british, but that's what also makes it really interesting. A british perspective on things. The book has descriptions of all the episodes for the show's first two seasons. Along with each episode, comes a number of categories with it.... which has some of the best of the nasty dialogue. It has critiques and notes from critics including the author. It also features &quot;L.A. Speak&quot;, featuring slang used in the series. &quot;Logic, Let Me Throw You Out This Window&quot; is about all of the mistakes and goof ups in the show. There is even a section dealing with fashion and describes what characters were wearing and if they were good or not. Plus, there is just some dialogue. Topping really outdoes himself getting into the specifics of the mistakes, or just little details in the background or in the forefront. This guy really has a keen eye!. What would've made this book better was if there were some pictures. Nope. Not here. That is the only drawback to this exceptional book. Topping is a fan. He writes as a fan. He can be overy critical for some episodes, but isn't that a way die hard fans should be?. A great, fun read with really cool tidbits. Fans should really enjoy this!.	2002-05-09

If, like me, you are a Bradyphile, then you were probably shocked to read some of Mr. Williams' tales in this wonderful book. By now, these juicy secrets are common knowledge, but coming upon them for the first time was shocking. If you are not a fan of the show that ran from 1969 to 1974, this might not be for you. But you'd be surprised how many people who aren't big fans have read it and really liked it. It's a very entertaining book and very easy and fun to read. Mr. Williams writes with a great outlook on his Brady past. He doesn't take anything the least bit seriously here. Nor should he. The book begins with Barry's earlier beginnings. It's not page turning stuff folks, but it is interesting to read all of the old shows he guest starred on. Nothing gets good until we enter Bradyland. What fun it is. The most interesting stuff in this book to read are all of the fights and confrontations between Robert Reed(Mr. Brady), and the show's creator/producer/writer Sherwood Schwartz. It was constant, and it was bloody. It's real interesting to read how everyone's favorite dad acted behind the scenes. The stuff here is priceless. But, even if Mr. Reed comes off rather crass, you have to remember that he was just trying to help the show. Then again, if he really hated it, why did he always return for the reunions?. The hot stuff comes in the form of the Greg/Marcia romance. The two actors, Williams and Maureen McCormack, did get hot and heavy. Cindy and Bobby got serious, as did Jan and Peter too. Pretty soon, it would've been Carol and Tiger. The end of the book has the usual episode guide to all of the episodes. Some of them also have little sections to certain episodes with particular information on that episode. The book also covers \\"The Brady Girls Get Married\\", the huge TV hit \\"A Very Brady Christmas\\", and the 1990 'dramadey' show \\"The Bradys\\". The introduction is by Robert Reed himself, shortly before he passed away. What's great, and also heartbreaking, is how Mr. Reed passed away. The great part was him telling Florence Henderson to call and \\"tell the kids\\" as he said. It seemed very much like a father and his kids. That they were really like family. Mr. Reed passing away was heartbreaking. All in all, this is a great and fun read. The sex, the drugs, the dating, the fights. Who could ask for anything more?. I must warn you that there are a number of reviews below who rate this one star because they mixed up a character with an actor and so on. Can you believe that?. Take it easy people. I would also stay away from the review who claims that the episode guide is filled with mistake after mistake. Since it is coming from as solid a source as can be, and from someone who was there, I would believe what Mr. Williams says. That review just appears to be trying to destroy it for whatever reasons. I can't imagine there being anything else to say, but one wishes for book 2!. The Brady Bunch is a cultural phenomenon. No question about it. There once was a day when the show was ridiculed and made fun of. Things have changed since those days. The Bradys are cooler than cool. Hipper than hip. Anybody who is still anti-Brady, is still stuck in those old days like the Bradys seem to be forever stuck in the psychedelic 70's. It's time to catch up and get with the now people. The Brady's are here to stay. Bell bottoms and perms and all. Mr. Williams has written a fun book. Give it a shot. Enter Bradyland for a while. It's quite fun.	2002-04-19

A religious look on certain CD's and really pathetic reviews of them. It seems the writers will condemn a CD if one single lyric in the whole darn thing says something about a beer or a bar. You get the picture. This book is more damaging than it is helpful. Great work by great artists are slammed and dismissed because they speak the truth and talk about the real world. Real world with real, normal, everyday things. The authors obviously expect everything to be safe and to be perfect in the cookie cutter, Leave It To Beaver, delusional fantasy world they seem to be living in. I'm not knocking anything about religion here, but these guys are way off the mark here!. The reasons they give that slams a CD are sophmoric and juvenile. It's also a slap in the face insult to any teenager out there. They write like they are total dimbulbs who can't think on their own. Like they need to be saved from some evil they think is in some of these CD's. These kids are smarter than the authors give them credit for. They don't need anybody to hold their hand to cross the street. As a young person myself, I was really offended by it. I don't know who wouldn't. It also appeared that these guys used this book to promote other christian artists. At the end of a bad review, they recommend some artist. This book is ridiculous in every sense of the word. I understand parents wanting to monitor some stuff, and some stuff out there should be monitored by parents, but the stuff in this book is too far gone. It's almost a joke of epic proportions. I would skip this book at all costs. It's too preachy that doesn't give music, or talent, a fair chance. A big stinker that makes decisions for you instead of making your own.	2002-01-09

I think it's almost embarrasing that a nice family show with heart, morals, and values, has to be \\"uncool\\", or that people don't admit to watching it. Admit it!. Be proud!. This book about the WB show is a great buy for any fan, or for anybody who is interested in getting into the show and needs a little catching up to do. This book contains every episode, with a very lengthy summary of the episode, for the first four seasons. It also has some color photos, and some interviews with a few members of the cast. The show is a wonderful family show. People say it's corny, cheesy, or whatever. Well, so what?. Is that supposed to mean something?. No, it doesn't mean anything. It deals with some very serious issues. Not everything is all wrapped up and happy at the end of each show. The Camden family are not perfect \\"Brady\\" clones where the world's problems are solved in time for the ending credits. This is the kind of show we need more of. Especially now. If some people bash a show like this, which has been the #1 rated show on the WB for the last 3 seasons, and only WB show to crack the top 40, you wonder what kind of morals they have. Anyways, this is a great book to a great, classy, family show. 7th Heaven is T.V. heaven indeed. The show continues to do a great service for television and humanity.	2001-11-28

The book is about Sweeney's life, and her struggles. One minte it's funny, the next is heartbreaking and touching. The real beauty of the book, and Sweeney's wonderful writing, is that the book can be heartbreaking AND funny at the same time. The book deals with her brother Michael's bout of cancer. He moved in and she took care of him, while maintaining her sucessful career. Then, in a horrib;e twist of fate, Julia learns that she has cervical cancer. The same kind of cancer that claimed the life of Sweeney's SNL peer Gilda Radner. Luckily, Julia survived. The book also touches on her parents, who are told about in a truly hysterical way. How many parents are like this?. The book is a swift read. It's very easy to get into and read in almost one sitting. I actually got to meet Ms. Sweeney on a few ocassions. My family babysat her niece and nephew. She came to my house as well. We were also lucky enough to be invited to the premiere of her 'Pat' movie, as well as a reading from the book by Sweeney herself. She is a sweet, lovely person. This book is sweet as well. A good read. Trust me.	2001-11-06

It was perfect and nothing would top it. I was wrong. The Watcher's Guide Vol. 2 wipes the floor with Vol. 1 in everything. Sure, it's still great. This is better. It keeps the features that were in Vol. 1. Episode synopsis, character &amp; actor bios, dialogue, pictures. The synopsis of each episode is more expanded than the ones in the first. Plus, we get a day by day look at the production of a single episode of &quot;Buffy&quot;. It hits on everything!. I thought the first volume was the best inside guide to Buffy, and to any other television show for that matter. This one surpasses it in every way. You get everything you could possibly want or need in this new volume. It's stunning to look at and impossible to put down. This belongs on your book shelf. Nancy Holder has outdone herself on this one!.	2001-09-20
