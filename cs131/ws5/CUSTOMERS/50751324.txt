The women who wrote poems and stories for \\"Kiss Me Goodnight\\" are all very different, yet all share the same early loss.  Their contributions are beautifully written, moving, sometimes funny, and eye-opening.  Moms tend to be taken for granted by those who have them, but the women collected here didn't have that luxury.  It's fascinating to peek into their lives and see how each reacted to the unimaginable.	2005-05-29

Finding and sustaining love is always a challenge, and the older you get, you more you can become dispirited over your chances of ever finding a suitable partner.  Another Chance for Love takes the unusual stance that it's actually friendship that is the answer.  Seeking out, valuing, and deepening friendships with reasonably suitable individuals may lead you to a longterm, deep, and abiding love that will make your earlier quest for fireworks seem shallow.  Gordon and Shimberg discuss values, trust, communication, humor, and passion (not just for sex, but for life) - among the aspects of a good friend.  Relaxing into the safety and flow of an authentic friendship, they explain, is more likely to lead to something richer than if you begin every official \\"date\\" with unreal expectations.	2004-03-03

Masini has explored with uncommon honesty what it feels like to be lost, to be obsessed, to be haunted by the fact that one's beloved is sleeping with another. Her language never hits a false note.  I didn't see this as a &quot;New York book&quot; but as a tale about what goes on inside the mind of someone not capable of thinking clearly at the moment.  I found the narrator, the central character, to be utterly believable and real.  Just the right amount of suspense, and just the right amount of redemption (not much, but enough).	2004-02-25

The language was ordinary, the ideas were nothing new, there were many jarring flaws that relate -- in a way -- to point of view, which made me think this was intended as a young adult novel. A kind of gee whiz breathlessness on the part of the supposedly omniscient narrator that didn't seem to fit, to my eyes and ears. Overall, this isn't sophisticated or demanding in the least.  She tells us how different these two people are rather than showing us.	2004-01-12

It's harder than it sounds: many of us turn into rebellious or inadequate or withdrawn kids again. It helps a lot to aim for increased self-awareness. This clearly written book by Susan Newman offers a multitude of insights and anecdotes and much wisdom to help us get along better with those who used to get away with bossing us around.  I also think reading this book would be a good way to get a handle on how our own kids will one day think about US. Eeek.  Prevention is the better part of valor, or something like that.	2003-12-11

This book aims to counter that trend by offering numerous suggestions for achieving balance before, during, and after the big day.

While I wouldn't put aside a terrific novel to hear what an editor/reporter/reviewer has to say about a batch of books she more or less chaotically chose to read over the course of a year, it was fun to eavesdrop on Nelson's lighthearted yet insightful musings.  An engaging memoirist, she shares who she is, her own failings and humanity, the state of her marriage, the condition of her nightstand pile of unread books, while letting us in on her choosing and reading and writing process.  I don't thoroughly relate to her ending, though, where she muses on what she may have missed by reading so much (the relocation of a local art museum, some TV that everyone else has been watching).  Choices must be made in a busy life, and it's a good thing, really, to opt for literature over the incessant pull of pop culture.  Nelson's enthusiasm for some of the books she read, though, should make many of her own book's readers head straight for their own toppling reading piles with fresh verve.	2003-10-21

Written in an inspirational, almost cheerleading tone, with nary a footnote,  it offers a multitude of ways to get out of your rut and into the life you've only been dreaming of.  A professor of psychology, Kleinfeld is a warm-hearted guide to the frontiers of life, those out there and those inside ourselves.  Based on her own and her husband's experiences in Alaska, as well as the lives and anecdotes of numerous other adventurers of every type, Go For It! shows readers how to be true to themselves by taking reasonable prepared risks.  According to Kleinfeld, it pays to ask yourself the right questions and take advantage of possibilities you thought you're never be able to realize.  Frontiers are a state of mind as well as a physical location.  With this book, anyone can make their personal frontiers wonderfully habitable if they but choose to.	2003-10-09

Any single parent who is struggling with the burden of childrearing all alone, whether new to the role or not, would pick up insights here.

What parent couldn't benefit from being reminded of what matters and what can be let go of in the interests of a more positive and happy family life?

It's all about how she thinks, feels, invents, and copes with life, and the writing life in particular.  What could be more fascinating, especially in the hands of a master like Gerber?  In the form of personal essays and stories that float above the border between fiction and memoir, Gut Feelings is a beautifully detailed introduction to the mind of a prize-winning novelist and short story writer who's been at it for decades.  From how she fell in love with her husband, to tales of the various suicides she's known, to a short unfinished autobiography (with  photos), this is one of those grab-bags in which every single item you pull out is worth examining closely and cherishing.  Portions have appeared in various prestigious literary journals, but the compilation feels as though it was originally intended to be gathered all together in this one place - so we could get to share a satisfying amount of time with one fine writer.

This one taught me some fresh ideas.  I found Chapter 5 really does offer \\"Effective Presentation Tips, Tools, Techniques.\\"  For instance, I'm always tempted to give away the store in my talks, and D'Vari explains the rationale for limiting a talk to three key points: people encounter sensory overload beyond that.  She suggests identifying a client need and filling it.  Don't wave your notes in the air.  Find a way to use powerful body language.  Take advantage of the power of the pause.  She stresses how crucial the close of your talk is.  I know that I often trail off as time runs out, at least at bookstore workshops.  But the last two minutes of your talk are more important than a lot of what went before, so always plan to end with your best sound-bytes.  This is a fine overview for first-timers, as well as a fount of wisdom for anyone who needs to give public talks.	2003-03-27

The rest of the chapters cover financial issues, taxes, social security, and so on, including some thoughts about funeral arrangements.<br />Written by experts in their fields, these chapters offer up-to-date information and provide an excellent starting point for getting back on one's feet.

It's a warm and encouraging book by a warm and generous writer (she contributed to my own book on the creative process, Writing in Flow, and I was impressed at that time by her articulateness) about how and why to get involved in a supportive writing community. Rather than fall into an existing group, perhaps composed of wannabes who don't know how to critique usefully or who will feel competitive with each other, you might take Wolitzer's advice and take charge of rounding up like-minded others. She includes rich detail about how to operate such a group, plus lots of concrete advice and suggestions from other authors on the actual writing: dialogue, sex scenes, setting, much more. Smoothly written and enjoyable to read. Marvelously inspiring.	2001-11-07

This one caught me and I started reading.  Couldn't stop until I'd finished.  What a charming writer!  Seems to me a likely successor to Judy Blume and Robert Cormier.  This fast novel has all the elements of modern life's challenges (a distant gay dad, a lukewarmly welcomed but pretty decent stepdad, misbehaving hair that ruins more than a day, glasses you try to take off whenever dreamboat is around, an almost too-protective mom, and a sister who did everything beautifully, or did she?). It's the humorous tone that attracted me, but the sharp psychological insights are everywhere too. The suspense about missing Alison is relatively low-key, but manacingly present throughout.  The ending worked perfectly, in the context of the protagonist's philosophy of life, which includes both randomness and acceptance.<br />As a writing instructor (online mainly), I'm going to be recommending this one for all YA writers to take notes from.	2001-03-10

Journals are so good for that kind of catharsis.  Joan Mazza's guided journal, Things That Tick Me Off, may be where you turn when you need a safe place to ventilate, but because Mazza is so skilled at what she does, you'll likely end up feeling much more relaxed.  You might even tap into some creativity while you're emoting according to the many prompts she provides.<br />Divided into chapters that cover such hot button stress areas as work, personal life, and world affairs, this book also has a lot to say about how to transform your anger into something that can do you -- and maybe others -- some good.  A great starting point if journaling is new to you, and a good new beginning if you've become bored with your same old diary.<br />In my own life, I've found that focused, &quot;one subject&quot; journals like this can be enormously helpful and satisfying.  As if anger didn't swoosh over into ALL areas at times!  It's even possible that by tapping into all that fury and frustration, you might be able to convert what you come up with into something creative.  A story, a poem, a letter?	2000-12-12

But you don't have to be a true aficionado of Star Trek in all its permutations to benefit from -- and enjoy -- this unusual approach to the fascinating subject of ethics.  That's because, at the start of each chapter, authors Barad and Robertson describe various individual shows in enough (but never too much) detail so that you can picture the scenes and participate fully in the lively conversation.  What's right and what's not?  Whose view of ethics was applied by the makers of the show, and which SHOULD be applied in each convoluted instance, Aristotle's or Kant's, Sartre's or the Christians?<br />The tone of the writing is always fresh and conversational, without oversimplifying the topic. Is Spock sometimes &quot;too logical,&quot; or is Kirk sometimes too swayed by emotion?  How can we tell?  By the final results -- the universe is saved yet again -- or by what they hoped would happen? I found myself drawn in again and again, able to follow the thread of what is, after all, a high level discussion.  Highly recommended for the casual reader interested in how we determine what to do in living a &quot;good&quot; life.  I'd love to see this used in high schools and colleges to introduce people to these age-old but always fresh ideas in a compelling way.	2000-12-11

The ending left me a bit less satisfied than the first nine-tenths, but even so, I read it all hungrily and will read more of this literary author's work.  I especially liked, as I usually do, that things don't always turn out happy and that people are mixed -- both good and something far different.

Later, as a social scientist myself, with a particular interest in moral quandaries, the whole issue of the rightness or wrongness of the decision has fascinated me.  Now, for the first time, Palevsky's ATOMIC FRAGMENTS takes on this issue in a human, compelling, heartfelt manner.<br />After the death of her much-loved father, who was involved in the science of that era and who spent much effort later on to ensure such horrors would never again need to be unleashed, Palevsky was drawn to interview many of the physicists, now aging, who were directly responsible for those bombs.  She magnificently intersperses her questions, their responses, and her impressions -- allowing readers to feel as though we were there too.<br />I especially appreciate the lack of easy conclusions. In the best tradition of qualitative research, Palevsky asks, reports, wonders, considers -- and leaves the unanswerable unanswered.	2000-11-23

You don't have to be a certain age to appreciate creativity, and these remakes of the old Rumpelstiltskin fable are certainly original.  The wonder is the author comes through time after time, six times in all, with a fresh way of framing the timeworn characters.  And characters they are -- each one different, each one oozing vanity, or avarice, or foolishness, or sometimes sweetness.  I'd recommend reading this if you want to unleash your own creativity, no matter what kind of writing you do.	2000-11-04

When Hauswirth began planning for  parenthood, she decided to write vignettes around the sayings her mother  always pulled out at opportune moments -- those sayings that stuck with  Hauswirth down through the years.  She did this in order to crystallize  them in her mind, so she could use the best ones with her own child.<br />I  see this book as suiting two excellent purposes.  One is for any parent, at  any stage of the parenting enterprise, to provide instant warmth and  inspiration to be a loving and supportive parent.  I also see this as a  lovely example of a focused memoir.  If you're itching to write the story  of your life, as so many people are, the task can be overwhelming.  Things  My Mother Told Me is a superb instance of breaking such a vast storehouse  of memories down into something succinct, manageable, and pleasurable to  read.	2000-08-16

Anyone who reads this book as just another saga of a dysfunctional family  is not used to reading real literature.

The character of the brother, and his horrific  interactions with the narrator as a little girl -- ouch.  Yet there's some  redemption at the end, without going all sappy by any means.  I really  enjoyed this, but then I like a book that doesn't sugarcoat reality as I  see it. The style is fairly minimal, not overwritten, not a lot of  description to slow things down.

I enjoyed the first half of this book so much, filled as it was with  original characters and fresh situations.  Who could resist a cat who was  comatose 23 hours out of 24, but whose owner loved him madly nevertheless?  And a female astronaut who learned faster than anyone else, but who was  still prey to love problems?  Once I got to the second half, though,  somewhere in a star system far far away, the goings-on weren't as much fun  for me.  I was never the least bit tempted to quit reading, but I wanted to  get back to the home planet where the characters were REAL, not giant red  and blue robots, a creature named Ooze, something called Rastus, computer  consoles that saw and knew all (well, not so unreal after all), and a very  smelly overlord, or whatever he was.  In other words, the story went from  magic realism to total fantasy, even though, I must say, the author makes a  good case for the physics of what's happening.  The quotes about quantum  physics interspersed throughout, by the way, added a lot for me.  All in  all, a funny, tongue-in-cheek, and sometimes thought-provoking novel.	2000-08-02

Mazza is a gentle guide, always supportive and compassionate,  asking numerous thought-provoking questions and sharing her own inner life  in an enlightening way. Unlike the authors of some pop dream-analysis  books, she doesn't tell you what to think or what your dream means -- she  leads you toward greater understanding of your own life and dream symbols.  I find Mazza's approach psychologically credible and personally insightful.

I can't imagine a child not discovering the joys of  science (broadly defined) when a parent introduces him or her to some of  these delightful activities.  The best thing about the book is that so many  of the ideas don't require vast preparation, but can be done  spur-of-the-moment.	2000-07-12

It's the best of its ilk:  good qualitative research, heavily based on personal  experience, written anecdotally and fascinatingly.  I see this as akin to  Deborah Tannen's excellent work in &quot;You Just Don't Understand.&quot;  If only more people were aware of how relative our cultural assumptions  are, it might prevent some hair-tearing as we travel and also prevent some  frustration here at home when we come upon others (even our own  spouses....) who have another way of thinking/feeling about time.	2000-07-04

Recently found this on my shelf while cleaning out the clutter, figured it's time to read it.  Good choice.  It's real literature, and now back on the shelf to stay.  I disagree with all those who think it's  &quot;about&quot; love or relationships -- like all true art, it's not  &quot;about&quot; one thing.  It has a sort of bleak world view (some might  say), but it's honest, real, and reminds us to enjoy the journey, because  that's all there is. The fable took a while to grow on me, but I've never  read a fable within a novel that was so freshly and creatively written.  I'll be looking for this author's other work.	2000-06-29

One year isn't enough, I  told him, but with the help of 17 Lies, he just might make some real  progress.  I fully agree with Chandler's philosophy of taking charge of  your own life.  I think too many people are unaware of the options they DO  have and tend to focus on the areas where little change is possible.  All  in all, a good readable overview of the self-motivational field for anyone  who feels stuck and frustrated.	2000-06-05

I love Irving's way of extracting the horror of everyday life -- those losses that  happen randomly and always, cross our fingers, to someone else.  The main  character's dead older brothers were as real as my own children, making  their mother's lifelong grief seem utterly plausible and wrenching.  I also  love Irving's masterful &quot;children's&quot; stories that are integrated  throughout the early part of the book.  They may even be more layered and  haunting than the adult book itself.<br />One problem, at least, that  irritated me all the way through:  he keeps telling us what we will be  finding out later.  Way too much foreshadowing in a way that seemed awfully  clumsy and annoying to me.  Also reminding us of what we've already been  told, over and over, as though he doesn't trust the reader to remember.  And maybe we could have had a little less focus on bodies and how they look  compared to their ages.  Seemed a bit obsessive.<br />Yet I kept turning the  pages right up to the surprisingly wish-fulfilling ending.  Nothing wrong  with that, for a change.	2000-05-18

Cunningham did such a grand job of reiterating Woolf's theme -- to be or not to be, in essence -- but in his own postmodern way.  I loved  the way he explored identity by taking Woolf's plot points and giving them  to totally other people, and doing so in a way that turned out not to be  unduly self-conscious.  Yes, this felt experimental, but also a rousing  success.  I especially love the way Cunningham doesn't sugarcoat the big  issues, what I might call the &quot;shall I kill myself today or should I  watch this cloud, this car, this flower, and let it be enough,&quot;  quandary. Quietly unforgettable.	2000-05-12

Judy Reeves' book offers tidbits and  nuggets of firmness -- write about this today, try that -- but she  intersperses these suggestions with a philosophy of freedom.  Write what  you like, but do it every day. Short sections invite dipping into easily.  She quotes numerous writers, living and gone, and offers commonsense  guidelines that beginners often aren't yet familiar with. There's so much  valuable advice here that even if you don't agree with every single  sentence, you will learn a great deal that will get you writing.	2000-04-25

This  seems one of those brief dips into the psyche of very good authors that can  be so motivating to all of us at various stages of our careers, no matter  what we write or aspire to write.  Vonnegut and Stringer are both  passsionate about their work.  The latter tells of how he realized he  could write by describing his first extended flow experience, when he  decided to use his pencil, which he otherwise normally used as a drug  implement (to push screens into his pipe) to write.  After five hours of  nonstop focus, he realized this was something, besides seeking drug highs,  that he could really do well.  They both talk about the primary importance  of answering the big questions for themselves in their writing, and how  publishing the results is almost an afterthought.  Reminding us that even  nonfiction authors write to find out where we're going, Stringer says,  &quot;I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how I was going to fill up  these pages, and then, convinced that I'm not going to figure it out,  bingo! something happens.  It's like shaking hands with God.&quot;  There  may not be a lot to read here, but it's on target and REAL.<br />Susan K.  Perry, author of the bestselling WRITING IN FLOW	2000-03-12

I don't think everyone should be a writer any more than everyone should be a  dog trainer (it has nothing to do with talent, by the way, and everything  to do with doing what you LIKE). Once you get past that premise, is her  advice for freeing up your writing useful?  What she terms  &quot;initiation&quot; tools include freewriting, positive affirmations,  writing postcards to five friends in 15 minutes, listing 50 things that  make you happy or 100 things you love, and so on.  Though, clearly, such  tools are most helpful to writers who aren't flooded by ideas from morning  `til night, it's possible that if you're feeling stymied by your current  project, one of Cameron's exercises might unrust your creative gears and  help you enter flow (though the novelists and poets I interviewed for my  own bestselling WRITING IN FLOW almost never use such prompts themselves,  they admit they give them to their students -- so if you're new at this, do  whatever works).

One of the hallmarks of &quot;flow&quot; (see my own bestselling WRITING IN FLOW for lots on this) is a sense that you're in control -- at least enough to do the task you've set yourself. He offers a  variety of methods for getting going, from the familiar freewriting  to  using a list of metaphorical questions that he provides to inspire fresh  ideas.  One of his techniques, which he explains in great and useful  detail, is called loop writing or directed freewriting.  For instance, one  way to get started is to write out all your prejudices about a topic before  you begin writing it.  Interesting chapters on audience, feedback, and  revision.  Here's one of his astute suggestions: Never do major revising  when nauseated by your writing.	2000-03-12

In this book, for instance, she covers how to  show characters thinking, shifting points of view, the uses of repetition,  and so on. Although I normally don't care for exercises as such, hers are  fresh and flexible (write a page of descriptive narrative without  adjectives or adverbs or dialogue; you can do this as part of whatever  you're working on).

When a professor of mine spoke highly of BIRD BY BIRD, knowing I  was studying flow for my own (subsequently bestselling) book WRITING IN  FLOW, I was prepared to dislike it.  After all, Lamott's novels are hardly  famous, and the book she did begin to get known for is a memoir of the  first year of her son's life.  Since I started and stopped something  similar, I was jealous.<br />But then I fell under her spell.  Bird by Bird  is a very funny book, and most of the humor is the endearingly  self-deprecating kind.  Besides, Lamott speaks openly of her own jealousy  of any writer friend who is slightly more successful at the moment than she  is.  I'm a sucker for honesty.<br />Don't read this book to be entertained  however.  Read it to find out something about designing a plot, creating  characters, and writing dialogue.  Read it to find out how good writing  happens.  According to Lamott, it happens when &quot;you sit down at  approximately the same time every day.  This is how you train your  subconscious to kick in for you creatively.&quot;  The honest part comes  you stare at it for an hour or so.  You begin rocking, just a little at  first, and then like a huge autistic child.&quot;<br />This quick-reading  book is filled with fresh anecdotes, personal revelations, and practical  tips about taking notes, writing groups, and who should read your drafts.  You complete it all in a rush ending with the reassuring sense that regular  people, like the author and yourself, if you work harder than you expected  to have to, can produce something very good. And although Lamott mainly  writes about her own individual experiences, her insights and advice  coincide nicely with what I found to be true by interviewing 76 top  novelists and poets for my WRITING IN FLOW.	2000-03-09

And the further I got into it, the more pleased I was. First of  all, she lets readers know that she's only suggesting possible ways to  think about their dreams. When it comes to dreams, clearly, what any dream  therapist or author claims is only valuable if it helps you understand  yourself in some way. Next, I like that her focus is on health and  self-knowledge, not merely on diagnosing neuroses or worse. And then, her  approach is such a joyful one: she helps us find out how our dreams are  very likely making secret rebels of us all.<br />Dreaming Your Real Self is  practical too. For instance, I've been having this recurrent dream about  babies (often rather prococious babies), and I checked her section on what  this might mean. It began when my nest emptied, so I assumed I had it all  figured out. Yet I got some surprising insights, especially that the  symbols in the dream relate to what's happening to me NOW, even though my  subconscious chose this particular type of dream several years ago. Now  I've got something to reflect about and work with. Perhaps I'm actually  dreaming of my own untapped potential? The works I haven't yet written that  keep nagging at me to be born?<br />She's got a great section on dreams and  creativity too, and since the latter is my own area of expertise (I've  written a bestselling book called WRITING IN FLOW), I read it extra  carefully. Mazza is right on target here too, right down to her  descriptions of creative flow, and thus proves herself to me as a  trustworthy guide to the realm of dreams.	2000-03-07

Author Hurley shares many dozens of very short tales he wrote on the spot in only a minute for people who were waiting right in  front of him. Talk about pressure! But Hurley proves that writer's block  can be conquered, sometimes, by giving yourself a deadline. And he does a  lovely job of capturing some essence, some droll humor, some cosmic message  in each of these vignettes. I'd say he was able to force himself into a  state of flow (which I know a lot about from writing my own bestseller,  WRITING IN FLOW)and let the words come without having the time to think  about them too much. He seems to have a way of connecting with people  quickly and he certainly has the ability of turning that connection into  something quirky, fun, and surprisingly enjoyable to read. The next time  you say you don't have time to write, you should be ashamed of yourself.	2000-03-07

Golding takes chances and succeeds, never sticking to the expected. I loved the way it ended, which was satisfying in  a much deeper way than if all our longings (and those of the sympathetic  characters) had been readily fulfilled. It's pretty much a timeless tale,  though set a long time ago. Golding's got a lock on human nature and writes  with supreme flair about frailty, longing, and ambivalence.	2000-03-07

It describes what's  necessary, such as challenge, feedback, and focus on the present, and  suggests ways to incorporate these elements into your sport.

When he talks about combining writing what you love and making  a living doing so, it certainly rings true. How much compromise can you  make with the real world and still be congruent with your deepest self? In  DEEP WRITING, we learn the value of getting and staying engaged with our  writing (getting into &quot;flow,&quot; in other words). Maisel is  unusually frank, too, about his own successes, failures, and learning  experiences (not that you can or should even try to separate those three  things!). This book feels like an inspiring chat with a compassionate  therapist who understands the challenges of being a writer (which Maisel  happens to be).	2000-02-15

I read the husband's half of the story first, since Shields wrote that one first.  The author does a masterful job of not  repeating herself at all, amazing considering she's covering the same basic  period of time as experienced by two halves of a single marriage (though  the wife is away for several days at a conference -- an event that is a  delight to read about if you've ever been to a conference yourself).  Shields handles the everyday, tiny moments of a family's life with such  searing poignancy that I had to stop reading every so often and reflect --  and that is, to me, the sign of a very good piece of literature. I love the  way she uses the wife's quilting to explore the creative process (and her  writer's block segment, when the husband fiddles away his 'free' day, is  priceless and oh-so-true). The marriage feels real, the feelings of the  mother for her teen children are absolutely genuine in their crushing  intensity and occasional ambivalence, and the resolution of the book is the  kind I like best:  not neat, not melodramatic, not resolved once and for  all, yet leaving you with a sense that you've shared a life and gained  something permanent from the experience.  Subtle, funny, and though it was  first published in the early 80s, this unusual double novel is universal in  its themes.<br />Susan K. Perry, Ph.D., author of WRITING IN FLOW	2000-02-15

Tessina's book says everything I've been trying to tell him and  more:  how to start over, keeping your expectations reasonable, how  important it is to work out the old baggage BEFORE you start a new  relationship, etc.  Plus such priceless insight as the impossibility of  truly changing another person all by yourself.

I now use  &quot;flow&quot; as a lens to consider everything; so many people seem so  miserable because they haven't found their flow activity, or haven't been  willing or able to make room for it in their lives. In my own book, WRITING  IN FLOW, for which Csikszentmihalyi wrote the Foreword, I was able to apply  these ideas to a writing life, which shows their universality. My life  hasn't been the same since! FLOW describes how to recognize this altered  state and how to make it more likely to happen regularly.
