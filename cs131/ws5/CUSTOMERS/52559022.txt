I am trying to understand how humans could act with such incredible hatred and cruelty toward their fellow humans.<br /><br />This book has helped me in a different way.It has shown me how holding on to the sanctity of life can allow you to act in a totally selfless way.Rena promised she would bring her baby sister Danka back to Mama.The two endured years of struggle,and starvation,and disease and unspeakable cruelty,and they did it with the goal of freedom in sight. Day after miserable day.Year after miserable year.Rena's tenacity in keeping her promise shows  just how good a human being can be when she is without greed,or vindictiveness. When she is faced with seemingly one insurmountable challenge after another.<br /><br />I will keep the memory of Rena and Danka and her family,and the lives of the women that Rena touched in Auschwitz the rest of my life.<br /><br />If you have a need to reaffirm your belief in the basic goodness of human nature,I suggest you read this book.In it you will find the worst a human can be,but in the end,who won out? Not the nazis  .But Rena and Danka and thousands of others who simply hung on and endured.	2005-08-01

Ms.Crier has done a fine job in telling the dreadful story of the sociopath of the hour,Scott Peterson.She does not resort to sensationalism,but instead,relates the facts as they unfolded.<br /><br />I don't intend to read the other two books that are in the forefront of the Peterson case.I chose this one because Ms.Crier is a former judge who knows the law and now,writes well.<br /><br />As I stated in the rating..I only wish this book was a work of fiction.I think the country was galvanized by this case because it revealed to us the very depths of callousness and and evil  that humans are capable of when other people are \\"in the way.\\"Kind of like an SS thug.	2005-03-20
