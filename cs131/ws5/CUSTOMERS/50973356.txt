As the Old Kingdom falls again into a realm of darkness and terror, the people turn in desperation to the Abhorsen, the scourge of the Dead, for deliverance. But Abhorsen Sabriel is lost, missing in Ancelstierre--possibly even dead.<br /><br />It is up to Lirael, until a few days ago merely a Second Assistant Librarian of the Clayr and now Abhorsen-in-Waiting, to stop the Destroyer's resurrection. But Lirael, Mogget the cat, the Disreputable Dog and Lirael's nephew Prince Sameth are trapped in Abhorsen's House by Chlorr of the Mask, who is in league with the evil necromancer Hedge, who has tricked Sameth's old friend Nicholas Sayre into helping him dig up Orannis, the Destroyer.<br /><br />Lirael and her friends must travel across the Old Kingdom in a race against time, battling Shadow Hands and dark necromancers to reach Ancelstierre before it is too late. In the end Lirael has to go deep into Death itself, much deeper than her sister Sabriel ever went. But what hope can one young woman, new to the Abhorsen's craft, have against a terrible evil with the power to destroy life itself?<br /><br />ABHORSEN is a thrilling and totally absorbing conclusion to THE OLD KINGDOM trilogy and I hope Garth Nix will create more novels set in Abhorsen's world. Nix admits that talking animals are his favourite characters, and he certainly does these very well.<br /><br />While it isn't necessary to have read SABRIEL to be able to follow this novel, I would recommend it, and it definitely is necessary to read LIRAEL first, because ABHORSEN is actually a continuation of LIRAEL, while SABRIEL stands on its own.	2005-08-22

But one day, while tending to her duties, singing the song of chantment that helps keep the Wall solid, she is suddenly confronted by a stranger lying unconscious inside the Wall. How had this Outlander defied the magical chantments to enter Antaris? His name, he says on regaining consciousness, is Darrow. He tells her of the fear and hatred that hold sway in the Outlands, where the magic arts of chantment are disappearing. Defying the Head Priestess, Calwyn follows Darrow on a dangerous journey that takes them the length and breadth of Tremaris, to places more strange and wondrous than she could ever have imagined, and to a final terrifying encounter with the evil sorcerer Samis, who seeks to master all Nine Powers of chantment for himself.<br /><br />Kate Constable was born in 1966 in Victoria but spent much of her childhood in Papua New Guinea, without television but within reach of a library where she \\"inhaled\\" stories, and The Singer of All Songs, Book 1 in the Chanters of Tremaris series, is her first published book. Writes Sara Douglass (quoted on the book's back cover): \\"What a charming, captivating book! Kate Constable writes with such grace and clarity that she stands out from the pack ... One of the most enjoyable fantasies I've read in a long time.\\"<br /><br />This is, indeed, a truly remarkable debut novel. I look forward to Book 2 in the series and fully expect to see The Singer of All Songs at least given a place of honour in the lists of best books for young people.	2005-06-28

The birds remained silent. I felt the deep pleasure, no kin to elation, that acquiring the skills of the Tribe brings, until I heard the sound of breathing, and turned to see Lord Shigeru watching me.<br /><br />'You heard me,' I said, disappointed.<br /><br />'No, I was already awake. Can you do it again?'<br /><br />I stayed crouched where I was for a moment, retreating into myself in the way of the Tribe, letting everything drain from me except my awareness of the noises of the night. Then I ran back across the nightingale floor.<br /><br />The birds slept on.<br /><br />Across the Nightingale Floor is set in an imaginary land very much like feudal Japan.<br /><br />In a short note at the front of the book the author assures us that nightingale floors (uguisubari) are \\"real inventions\\" and the most famous examples can be seen in Kyoto at Nijo Castle and Chion'In. The one in this book was specially built to surround the entire house of the evil, murderous warlord, Iida Sadamu, to protect him from possible assassins, for no one can walk across it unheard. No one except a strange young man known to Iida as Takeo ...<br /><br />Takeo's real name is Tomasu. When his village is burned by order of Iida, and all its people killed, Tomasu is saved (certainly not by chance) by the mysterious Lord Otori Shigeru. Shigeru gives him the name Takeo because Tomasu is too common among the Hidden. Raised among this reclusive and spiritual people, Takeo knows only the ways of peace. But he must forget all that and become not only an Otori--adopted son of Shigeru--but also an assassin, and his victim is to be Iida. Takeo discovers he has the supernatural skills of the Tribe--preternatural hearing, the ability to be in two places at once, to become invisible--and Lian Hearn has woven this magic into an absorbing tale full of action, heroism and (in the form of the bewitching Lady Shirakawa, interest in whom has brought about the death of several men) romance.<br /><br />There is a reasonable amount of gruesome and bloody violence, but the author doesn't dwell on it and I didn't find it particularly disturbing. How it will come across if anyone makes a film of the book is quite another matter.<br /><br />I'm still wondering why Gillian Rubenstein felt obliged to take a male pseudonym for this trilogy, especially since the identity of Lian Hearn was discovered almost as soon as the book was published. It seems pointless to me for a well-known writer, still writing for the same audience, to pretend to be a new one. I'm also bemused as to how a floor constructed to deliberately squeak could sound the least like a nightingale, or indeed any songbird. Certainly my own squeaking floors sound anything but musical. Their noise is more akin to rusty door hinges than the song of a bird, and If I wanted to imagine they sounded like birds the birds would have to be the most raucous-voiced breed of parrots--whatever breed that might be! Hmm. I've just walked over the floorboards that squeak and perhaps I exaggerate rather too much. But the noise still isn't pleasant. I expect the builders of the nightingale floors in Japan had a special technique unknown to the builders of my modern home.<br /><br />I notice my copy of this book is a 2002 reprint.

No wonder Molly considers herself to be very ordinary! However, Molly is anything but ordinary. When, in a fit of boredom, she writes an advertisement for a job--\\"quests undertaken, lost things found, enchantments broken\\"--and doesn't even send it to the newspaper, it leads her to a magical tryst far beyond her cosy home. First a  small child is dumped without warning on the Gurneys' doorstep. Though Molly is used to sharing her home with foster children, Floris wasn't sent by the social services, who can't trace his origins. And there is something even more mysterious about him. To protect the child, Molly has to enter a world of dangerous witchcraft, in which her only ally is the devastatingly handsome musician, Icarus.<br /><br />Annie Dalton has it all: an exceptional story-telling skill, a style that, though deceptively simple, can only be described as poetry in prose, and the ability to create characters so complex they aren't just three-dimensional; they're almost four-dimensional. Judging from one of the review excerpts quoted in this edition, Out of the Ordinary may have been her first published book.  An unforgettable read.	2005-06-28

But still a stunning read	What's everybody staring at?<br /><br />      All right, so you've never seen an Arab before. Is that any reason to stare? My hair's not green. My skin's not blue. It might be darker than yours, but dark skin is quite normal in my country. So I'm short. So what? I'm not that short. I'm tall enough to see over my own knees. Anyone would think I had a giant candle-snuffer growing out of my forehead.<br /><br />      Look at that fellow there, gawking away. Face like a gob of spittle, and he's staring at ME. Why don't you get yourself a mirror, Spitface, if you really want something to stare at.<br /><br />      A one-armed child makes a rude gesture. Runs away as I poke out a viciously threatening tongue. No backbone, the little coward.<br /><br />      \\"Pagan.\\" Roland's voice is cold and stern. (Doesn't want his squire eroding the dignity of his arrival.) \\"Please behave yourself.\\"<br /><br />The year is 1188 and the infidels have conquered Jeruaslem. Pagan, forced into exile, is accompanying his master, Lord Roland, to the castle of Bram, Roland's home. But the castle, cold, dark and filthy, is not Pagan's idea of how lords live and neither is Roland's family anything like the type of family Pagan imagines someone as noble and dignified as Roland should have.<br /><br />Pagan is soon caught up in violent clashes between both family members and the family and their neighbours. At the heart of the bloody feud stands Esclaramonde, a highly principled woman whose enigmatic character and heretical religious beliefs both disturb and attract Roland, while Pagan himself finds that he too has unpalatable truths to confront.<br /><br />I am absolutely bowled over by Catherine Jinks's writing style. She must have done a huge amount of research before writing the Pagan books to be able to create such a wonderful portrait of mediaeval life in so few words. The excerpt quoted above (which is the beginning of the book) is a good example of prose that literally cries to be read aloud.

When will they come? What will they do? What does an army look like, encamped around a city? I've read so much, but I just can't imagine it.<br /><br />This final novel in the Pagan series is told by bookish and rather delicate Isadore, who leaves his home village, where books are so hard to come by, to become scribe to Pagan, now Archdeacon of Carcassone. Isadore can hardly believe so irreverent a man could attain such a high position in the Church. But he soon learns Pagan's worth, not to mention how dangerous the world outside his little village is, for this is 1209, the year in which Papal forces from the north begin their bloody crusade against the Cathar heretics, and the battle line quickly moves closer to Carcassone.<br /><br />From the quote with which I start this review, it can be seen that Catherine Jinks doesn't abandon the spare writing style she used for Pagan's voice in the rest of the series. However, readers are left in no doubt that the narrator's character and personality are nothing like those of Pagan. While Isadore has many endearing qualities, most readers will find him less appealing than Pagan. I personally missed Pagan's sarcastic and humorous comments but still found this book as fast-paced and engrossing as the previous three.	2005-06-28

The first thing I noticed about this person was that he had a little blue flame sitting on his forehead. \\"Oh good,\\" I said. \\"You're a wizard.\\" I knew he could see and hear me. But he didn't seem any too certain that he was a wizard. My heart sank rather.<br /><br />So begins the blurb on the back of The Merlin Conspiracy, in which Diana Wynne Jones has outdone herself. The story is told alternately, in first person, by the two main characters, teenagers Arianrhod Hyde (Roddy) and Nichothodes Mallory (Nick). Roddy lives in an alternate England called the Isles of Blest and travels with The King's Progress because both her parents are court wizards. Nick lives in England on plain old Earth, but dreams of living somewhere more interesting. So when he finds himself suddenly somewhere else it is literally a dream come true. In Roddy's world the current Merlin dies and a new one takes his place. But something is wrong. The rituals have been upset and nothing is going as it should. It appears a group of powerful wizards are using the new Merlin to attack Blest. Roddy seeks help from Nick, for signs indicate that he is the answer to her problems. Nick is all too willing to help, but finds it worrying that she has mistaken him for a magic-user.<br /><br />The characters are as varied and complex as the absorbing plot (possibly Jones's most convoluted to date) but I had trouble only once, when the Izzies (identical twins named Isadora and Ilsabil) were sent to Mrs Candace's house, and the next time I saw her name I couldn't work out who she was. A quick back-track soon put me right. I wouldn't blame the author for this problem. I would be the first to acknowledge that I'm not very good at keeping track of a large cast of characters, and this is the first time I've had this problem in a DWJ book.<br /><br />Mini, the lost circus elephant, stands out among all the non-human characters. It was so easy to picture her shifting from one foot to another with embarrassment, just like a human. I was sorry when we had to leave Romanov's island and therefore say good-bye to her, and wished she had been given a bigger part in the plot, so it was a real pleasure when she turned up again.<br /><br />Complex though the plot is, the reader has no difficulty following it, and it doesn't take much imagination to picture most young readers turning back to the beginning as soon as they have finished it.

On the face of it, Arthur Penhaligon is very poor material for a hero. He is so severely asthmatic that an attack brought on by a compulsory cross-country run at his new school is about to end his life. Someone on the point of death is exactly what the sinister stranger Mister Monday wants, and he gives Arthur a key shaped like the minute hand of a clock. But it doesn't work as Mister Monday intended, for with the key in his hand Arthur can breathe as though he has never had asthma. However, along with the key comes a plague brought by bizarre creatures from another realm--dog-faced men in bowler hats called Fetchers. These, along with Mr Monday and his avenging messengers with blood-stained wings, will stop at nothing to get back the key, even if it means destroying Arthur and everything around him. In desperation, Arthur ventures into a mysterious house--a house only he can see. This is where Arthur must unravel the secrets of the key and discover his true fate.<br /><br />I found this book (especially the Prologue) more bizarre than either Sabriel or Lirael, but every bit as engrossing. I have to marvel at an author who publishes the first book in a long and complex series without having first written all the others. I wouldn't like it myself because if a brilliant deviation from the outlined plot occurred to me for a later book, but it needed a rewrite of the first book, this couldn't be done. Garth Nix has a hard act to follow in this first, highly imaginative book of The Keys to the Kingdom. And he has to do it six times!<br /><br />Incidentally, I read the following in a review by a young reader here on amazon.com and had to smile.<br /><br />\\"Written slightly below the level of the Harry Potter books this series should still capture the attention and imagination of young readers attracted to these types of stories. I found it to be a fun and enchanting read, maybe a little tame, but then I'm somewhat older than the target audience.\\"<br /><br />How he could have found Arthur's ordeals \\"tame\\" I have no idea!

Too many books suitable for this age group are classed as \\"young adult\\"--possibly because the readership of YA books is more likely to be 15 and under than genuine young adults, and many young readers like to feel they are reading above their age level, so authors and publishers pander to this. I do know that at age 15 I wouldn't have \\"been seen dead\\" reading a children's book because, even though 15-year-olds of my generation were considerably less sophisticated than today's 15-year-olds, I considered myself \\"too old--nearly grown up\\".

As danger mounts and the Holy City is besieged, Pagan finds friendship--and risks everything to keep it.<br /><br />The above excerpt, which is the beginning of the book, gives a good indication of Catherine Jinks's extremely spare writing style with its constant peppering of incomplete sentences. It is as though Pagan himself, who has been raised in a monastery and is therefore very literate as well as observant, is speaking to us. It also makes for a fast-paced and absorbing story that simply cries to be read aloud.

PIM and Jansi forge an unlikely friendship and when PIM is threatened with destruction by Stelcorp they need all their cunning to stop this happening.<br /><br />Some people might consider this book to be science fiction (because it features space ships) but it's probably more accurate to describe it as science fantasy because it's definitely in the realms of fantasy that humans will ever create a sentient machine of any type, never mind a machine as complex as a space ship.<br /><br />Catherine Jinks abandons the stark spareness of the writing style used in the Pagan books, which abound with incomplete sentences, while still writing succinctly. I love the way each scene is revealed to the reader first through Jansi's eyes and then through PIM's. Jinks is the first writer to use present tense without unsettling me.

Edward meets a mysterious old man who gives him a one-word message for his son. Edward can't read it; it's in a foreign language. \\"My son will know you,\\" he tells Edward. Then Edward helps an exhausted swimmer to shore and takes him to the home of the three elderly Newnes sisters, who run a B&B but are still waiting for their first guest. Over the sea Edward sees a vision of a land of ice and snow that nobody else can see and sometimes even he can't. He becomes increasingly sure he will find his father there. The swimmer gives him the opportunity to visit the land. But time is fast running out ...<br /><br />This absorbing fantasy won the last Fidler Award (2001). Woven in with Edward's story is the Norse myth of the Death of Baldur. Each of the characters in the story has a counterpart in the Baldur legend.<br /><br />I very much doubt this is Patricia Elliott's first book, though it's obviously her first for children or it wouldn't have been eligible for the Fidler. She has the gift of highly detailed characterisation that isn't likely to make a middle-grade reader impatient with all the description. The book is also extremely well written.  I don't think there was one point in which I was jerked out of the story by bad grammar or clumsy punctuation--something that happens all too frequently these days.<br /><br />Finally, as a writer for children myself, I must express my concern that the Fidler Award has been discontinued.

They go to the park where other children are playing a game they call Beatie Bow. Both Natalie and Abigail are very taken by a strange girl that Natalie calls \\"the little furry girl\\", who is closely watching the game. But the little girl flees, squawking, when they talk to her. Later, wearing a dress she has made from some Victorian crochet lace, Abigail sees the little furry girl again. When the child flees from her she follows--to soon find herself in streets she no longer recognises.<br /><br />Young readers might find this time-slip novel a little slow to start, even for a book published in the 1980s, but if they persist they will soon find themselves in a thoroughly absorbing, and often terrifying, tale. While it might have surprised Abigail that the undersized, illiterate girl who was always screeching \\"I'll punch ye yeller and green!\\" became someone of considerable importance, I doubt young readers will be surprised. Beatie Bow is a thoroughly unforgettable character and Ruth Park's prose is always a joy to read.<br /><br />It made me sad to see the reviews here posted by students who were forced to \\"study\\" the book at school. This is a serious disservice to everyone concerned because all it's likely to do is turn young people against reading. Fiction should be for fun not for study.	2005-06-28

Now that Mr Chesney's offworld tours have stopped, money from tourism has dried up. Eight years after Mr Chesney's departure, High Chancellor Querida has left Wizard Derk and his family to run the world and the good-looking Wizard Corkoran to run the University. Having chosen for himself the students whom he thinks are the richest, Corkoran sends begging letters to their parents. But he is in for a shock, for he discovers, after the letters have been sent, that Wizard Derk's daughter Elda is a huge golden griffin, King Luther's son is penniless, the Emperor's sister has been disowned by the Senate, while the dwarf, far from being in possession of a treasure hoard, is a runaway slave.<br /><br />An even worse shock comes with the first reply from a student's family--in the form of assassins. The situation quickly hurtles out of control.<br /><br />Year of the Griffin is a sequel to the award-winning The Dark Lord of Derkholm and is every bit as hilarious, with non-stop action that keeps the reader turning the pages, eager to know what happens next. While it isn't necessary to have read The Dark Lord of Derkholm first, I think it's a good idea.<br /><br />Elda is just as she appears in the first book and has to be one of the most lovable non-human characters Diana Wynne Jones has created--and she is a master at creating such characters. Like all of DWJ's books, Year of the Griffin makes a great read for adults as well as young people. A quote from the Independent appears on the front cover: \\"Knocks all rivals into a witch's cocked hat.\\" While this is arguable, there are definitely not many writers of fantasy for young people who can match DWJ.	2005-06-28

In doing so he releases a terrifying monster from Maori mythology imprisoned there centuries ago (using the stone Owl has stolen) by a famous Maori chief. It is now Owl's job, with help from Tama, a young Maori friend, to re-enact the imprisoning of Pouakai.<br /><br />The Maori mythology Joanna Orwin uses in this book is of her own invention, but is nonetheless as convincing as anything from real Maori legend. For me, Pouakai (Haast's Eagle) was all the more terrifying because it really did exist until about four centuries ago. I understand three complete skeletons are held at the Otago Museum in New Zealand, the Natural History Museum in London and the National Museum in Wellington.<br /><br />Joanna Orwin writes very well, but there was no need for the expletive made popular by the (admittedly humorous) Toyota TV commercial because she captures the flavour of New Zealand speech well enough without it. However, if I had children (or grandchildren) I would not stop them reading a book with bad language in it. I am as capable as my mother was of making them understand that such language is unacceptable.<br /><br />I did find the switch from past tense to present for the big climactic scene distracting. It felt contrived, adding nothing to the story. But I had trouble putting down this book. I do all my reading in bed at night and was turning the pages of Owl long after I should have been asleep.	2005-06-28

Of course, I have to believe the evidence of my own eyes! But if Bloomsbury wanted another Harry Potter they could have done a lot better by digging further into their slush piles. Warriors of Alavna is not just bad fantasy but plain bad writing. It reads like someone's first attempt at writing a novel.<br /><br />The book's beginning--'Dan watched with horror as Ursula was swallowed by the yellow mist'--immediately rings bells of alarm in the mind of discerning readers (who want to FEEL the horror with Dan, not be told about it) and things don't get any better as the chapter progresses. Editors are always telling beginner writers to 'show, not tell!' So why was the author of Warriors of Alavna, whose style is very much that of a beginner but who might have landed up writing a good book if forced to rewrite, not told to rework this scene so readers could feel Dan's horror and (as told later in the chapter) share Ursula's hurt at Dan's jokes about her height and weight--the supposed reason for her running away from him into the yellow mist?<br /><br />The short sentences (presumably deliberately short to grab as big a share as possible of the Harry Potter market) are neither simple nor elegant--just downright choppy and dull. There are also too many run-on sentences. There shouldn't be ANY. Unlike incomplete (and even one-word) sentences, run-on sentneces serve no purpose at all. And I became so tired of reading the sentence, 'She was very afraid.' I didn't want to be told the character was afraid; I wanted to FEEL the fear.<br /><br />I had to force myself to finish Warriors of Alavna, if only to find out if the structure and plot were as bad as the unbearably dreary syntax. The clumsy opening scenes led me to expect they would be. Writers (even new ones) normally work harder on the first chapter of a book than on almost any other.<br /><br />If your children are fantasy fans do them a favour and buy them only the best.

Every time it breathed, it scorched a trail of fire across the earth. Its neck was long, graceful, and glittering like gold. Its wings were folded close against its brilliant body, the wing sections shiny and ribbed like fish fins, the fine bones ending in sharp hooks. The long barbed tail was bent, the bones set crookedly, yet it coiled and uncoiled as slowly and smoothly as a snake. All the dragon's movements were smooth, fluid and fascinating, almost spellbinding in their beauty and their deadliness.&quot;<br /><br /> Everyone thinks dragons are extinct--until a fierce flying beast swoops upon the village of Doran, leaving it in flames. Young Jude survives only because, on the fatal day, he went to Rokeby to buy himself a new bow and arrows. Homeless, desperate, and wracked with grief and guilt, Jude joins a travelling fair, where he meets a young Chinese girl, caged and displayed as a freak. Jing-wei, in spite of her humiliating plight, is strong-willed, brave and cunning. She has her own plan for hunting the last dragon. But will it work? What if the dragon lands up merely wounded? Can she help Jude conquer his fear in time to save their world from destruction?<br /><br /> It is Jude himself who tells the story, set in 1356. And this is where problems arise. Jude is an ordinary villager (or peasant) and therefore cannot read or write. Sherryl Jordan's solution is to have Jude relate the story to a monk, who writes at his dictation. Unfortunately, this poses another problem. All Jude's greetings and asides to Brother Benedict are included, which tended to jerk me out of the story because, although they do add background flavour and an extra dimension to the story, their presence felt most unnatural in that Benedict simply wouldn't have been able to write fast enough to get everything down, especially since he would be continually having to refill his quill. But in the face of such powerful story-telling, not to mention the sheer beauty of Sherryl Jordan's prose, to complain about this seems like nit-picking.he face of such powerful story-telling, not to mention the sheer beauty of Sherryl Jordan's prose, to complain about this seems like nit-picking.  <br />	2004-07-26

But almost as soon as he and his mother move there Nathanial knows there is something wrong--something hideously wrong. And it isn't just the stench from the old abattoir, which doesn't seem to bother most residents.<br />Nathanial soon learns he is not in Cheshunt by accident. As the dark calls its own, so does the light. Nathanial must confront phantoms from his own past if he and all the others called by the light have any hope of stopping the Gathering and its creator.<br />The word \\"dark\\" in The Gathering should really have a capital letter (as it does in Susan Cooper's The Dark Is Rising) for the forces of evil could not have been more vividly realised than in this book. A number of people who have read it see the Cheshunt school's headmaster, Mr Karle (\\"the Kraken\\") as a representation of Hitler. In a quote on the book's front flyleaf Terry Lane is reported to have called The Gathering \\"a dark, grim allegory of fascism\\". Many young readers might not realise just how accurate the analogy is because Hitler actually ran an organisation called The Occult Bureau. (If anything proves how insane Hitler was, this waste of time and resources surely does.)<br />The evil depicted in The Gathering is truly spine-chilling and I think the main reason for this is that Carmody doesn't rely solely on occultism to create the evil. While Nathanial's schoolmate Buddha (a very strange name for an evil character) is clearly driven by the Kraken's supernatural influence when he burns Nathanial's dog alive, there is nothing supernatural about how he does it. I found this incident so disturbing it kept me awake for hours. The scene in the fourth Harry Potter book that several people described as too frightening for many children pales by comparison. This is partly because monsters like Voldemort exist only in someone's imagination. Any well-adjusted child knows this, but also knows that it would be all too easy to murder a little dog as Buddha does.<br />I found a page of reviews by teenagers ([...]) where there were quite a few readers who didn't like The Gathering, and I suspect this is because they had to study it at school and write an essay on it, or answer a series of questions calculated to make them really think. (Some of them seem to have entered their views here.) Most young people would probably have enjoyed The Gathering if simply given it as being a \\"cool\\" book to read. Although the page of reviews mentioned above is peppered with the sort of review so often found on amazon.com (i.e., the \\"this is the best book in the world\\" type of review) several children have posted the material they were required to produce when studying the book at school.Any well-adjusted child knows this, but also knows that it would be all too easy to murder a little dog as Buddha does.<br />I found a page of reviews by teenagers ([...]) where there were quite a few readers who didn't like The Gathering, and I suspect this is because they had to study it at school and write an essay on it, or answer a series of questions calculated to make them really think.

Her family insists they see her coming and going when she's been out of the house for hours. Who--or what--is taking over Laurie's life?<br />A short blurb on the front cover proclaims: \\"Someone is watching Laurie, waiting to steal her life.\\"  How could any young reader resist such a line? When I picked up this book I couldn't.<br />Stranger with My Face, told in first person, starts off more as though it's going to be a thriller than a fantasy. But as the fantasy element strengthens it becomes steadily scarier, building into a terrifying climax that makes for an exciting, unputdownable read.<br />This book is definitely intended for young adults (after all, the protagonist is 17 years old) but I suspect most readers will be a lot younger. Few 12-year-olds can resist a really scary story. I certainly couldn't. I remember reading Jane Eyre (one of the few good books to come my way, purely by accident) and it was the mad woman in the attic rather than the hopeless love between Jane and her employer that kept me turning the pages. :-)<br />Many of the reviews here, I feel, give away too much of the plot. But I particularly like Heidi Lott's review and envy the fact that she obviously had someone around when she was young to point her in the direction of the best books for young readers. Like Heidi, I would also recommend Stranger with My Face to any adult who loves a good story well told.	2004-07-15

As mighty icecaps melt, the Earth is losing its land to the ocean--and Mara knows she and her whole community will soon drown.<br />Howewver, there may still be hope. For Mara's favourite occupation is visiting the Weave (a version of the World Wide Web) on her portable cyberwizz (an outdated piece of &quot;virtual reality&quot; type technology, powered by solar batteries) and there she sees something extraordinary--hints of a New World, rising from the sea and reaching into the sky; cities where desperate refugees can surely find safety.<br />In a frantic bid for survival, Mara and her friends set sail in the ultimate exodus. But Mara's quest will become something even greater--a journey into humanity's capacity for good and evil, and a heart-wrenching story of love and loss ...<br />&quot;Intellectually rigorous and bursting with humanity, this is a book to read again and again,&quot; said the Sunday Herald.<br />What could I possibly add this this? Exodus is a truly stunning book, an engrossing read for both young people and adults, and deserves to win many awards and become a top bestseller. Unfortunately, the latter is unlikely; it's seldom the best books that become bestsellers.<br />Warning: If sad stories tend to make you weep, keep plenty of tissues handy. Julie Bertagna tells her story without a hint of sentimentality, but its powerful simplicity is still bound to land some readers in tears.	2004-07-15

There was a barely perceptible pause. Then two yellow staring eyes materialized in the heart of the smoke.<br />Hey, it was his first time. I wanted to scare him.\\"<br />The 5,000-year-old djinni Bartimaeus resents being under the power of human magicians, especially when the one who summons him is a mere stripling of a boy. Bartimaeus expects to have to do nothing more taxing than a few simple illusions for Nathaniel But Nathaniel has talent way beyond his years and has something considerably more dangerous in mind: revenge against a magician who made him look a fool. Nathaniel sends Bartimaeus off to steal the powerful Amulet of Samarkand from Simon Lovelace, a master magician of unrivalled ruthlessness and ambition who will do ANYTHING to achieve his ends. And so both djinni and apprentice boy wizard are soon caught up in a terrifying flood of magical intrigue, murder and rebellion that makes for a thrilling read for fantasy-lovers of all ages.<br />The excerpt starting this review comes on the second page, and the whole of the first page is descriptive, much like the first paragraph of the excerpt, so it's only when you read the last sentence that you realise this is a first-person account. It's an electrifying introduction to Bartimaeus and sets the scene for the hair-raising and hilarious things that will occur whenever the djinni is around.<br />However, when the story moves to Nathaniel's viewpoint, Jonathan Stroud wisely adopts third person rather than trying to imitate the language of a modern young teenager. I found the change a little disconcerting at first but soon became comfortable with it. Sometimes when Stroud makes a switch in viewpoint readers are returned to the beginning of the scene they have just read, which makes for some fascinating contrasts. It's also probably why the book is rather long, though it never seems so.<br />The Amulet of Samarkand is a stunning read (it knocks any of the Harry Potter books into a cocked hat) and I can't wait to meet Bartimaeus again.

The plot is as complex as anything from Diana Wynne Jones. Susan Price describes the book as 'a sinister story of a conjurer and his mysterious cabinet'. The cabinet concerned is one of those boxes into which someone (ostensibly from the audience) climbs and seems to disappear.<br /><br />Margaret Mahy doesn't need a gloomy castle to create a creepy, amazingly scary atmosphere. She manages it in an ordinary urban New Zealand house. My home will never seem the same now. :-)<br /><br />A Friend pointed out three disturbing inconsistencies in this book that I must admit I didn't notice myself. Perhaps she read the book in larger chunks than I did. Perhaps, being younger, she simply has a sharper mind. :-) The inconsistencies are as follows:<br /><br />1. Roland's age is given as 17 (and he has a driving licence) and his younger brother Martin was born when he was eight. It is then said Martin is currently seven, which would make Roland 15, not 17.<br />2. The gift of six colouring pens, a notebook and a bar of chocolate later becomes six colouring pens, a notebook and a muffin.<br />3. Jess says her parents take it in turns to be at the house, and later says she is waiting for both to come home.<br />It is a sad fact that once a writer becomes famous editors are often too scared to suggest changes and it's disappointing that Margaret Mahy's editor is one of these. I remember my husband complaining about a Jack Higgins novel in which the protagonist cast his boat from its mooring without first starting its engine. Later, a small aircraft being used by the 'goodies' was tampered with in a way the pilot would have discovered when doing his pre-flight check. One could argue that Jack Higgins should have done his homework in both cases because you can hardly expect an editor to know the basic rules of boating, never mind anything about pre-flight checks on aircraft. I wasn't terribly sympathetic to my husband's complaint. I simply told him, 'That's what you get when you read best-sellers!'plaint.

While adult readers will know exactly what is going to happen to Lucien back in his own world, and this novel is intended for \\"young adults\\", it's likely to also have readers young enough not to guess so easily. The story is told in multiple viewpoint, which changes quite frequently, but the plot unfolds mostly through the eyes of the two main characters so few young readers are likely to be annoyed.

It's a world without crime, and with no unemployment--and therefore no poverty--nobody has to suffer hunger pangs, never mind the torment of starvation and homelessness. All members of a family unit share the experiences and \\"feelings\\" of their day each evening and nobody lies. Or so Jonas believes. Only when he learns that his lifetime job is to be the Receiver (taking on all the memories of both pain and joy that have been banished from his society, and being given permission to lie) does he realise the community's creators have banished even more good than evil from his society. Jonas and his tutor, the previous Receiver, to whom he gives the title the Giver, decide that the cost of their stable society is too high ...<br />Jonas's community clearly doesn't cover the whole world in which it's set, and one doesn't even have to travel over water to reach \\"Elsewhere\\", of which there are hints relatively early in the book. Most members of the community clearly believe that this is where people who are \\"released\\" go. Young readers possibly might not guess the truth here but I'm sure adult readers will.<br />For a book with such a complex set-up The Giver is amazingly short at less than 200 pages. If it had been a novel for adults I think it would have contained a lot more detail on how this utopian society was set up, because it does leave you asking questions about it. Lowry does, however, give enough detail for the purpose of her story and she handles it deftly, never getting in the way of the forward motion of the plot and therefore taking the risk of boring young readers.<br />I was amazed to hear that The Giver was on the list of \\"most challenged\\" books for 2000, on the grounds of \\"being sexually explicit, having occult themes, violence\\".

He also discovers that even a supposedly holy place can swarm with danger and corruption.<br />Pagan himself tells the story, writing in the present tense, which usually gives me trouble. I normally find it both stilted an unnatural. However, for this story it feels absolutely right. Although I can imagine that many young readers might take a while to become accustomed to Catherine Jinks's spare, distinctive style, I took to it (and her warm, wry humour) straight away. As can be seen from the above quote (the book's first paragraph) her writing abounds in unfinished sentences, which most writers normally use sparingly. But here the oft-used effect serves to underline Pagan's irreverence, which is my only quibble. While I personally found this trait highly entertaining (indeed, almost endearing) I have difficulty believing that someone raised in a monastery in those days would be quite so irreverent, especially at only 17 years of age. One of his favourite expletives is \\"Christ in a cream cheese sauce\\", which would certainly be accounted as blasphemous in those days.<br />But what does it matter when Jinks provides such an entertaining, \\"unputdownable\\" read?<br />I'm very pleased to learn that the Pagan books are to be republished, though 5 January 2004 (the projected date for the first book, Pagan's Crusade) seems rather a long wait.ojected date for the first book, Pagan's Crusade) seems rather a long wait.	2003-06-29

When his Tribe sees him as a danger to them, it is his own parents whose job it is to hunt him down and kill him. And Tom knows they will do just that if they catch him. He has no place to hide but the city of the demons, a noisy, smelly place of fast chariots and houses piled cheek by jowl. The demons are clumsy and loud-voiced. But worst of all, in Tom's eyes, are the ties that bind them to each other, while he is wild and free and determined to remain so. Tom wants nothing to do with the demons but but has no choice but to accept the help offered by a girl demon if he is to stay alive. And just because he isn't interested in the demons, it doesn't follow that they are not interested in him.<br />The quote on the English edition's cover from Michael Morpurgo suggests this was Sally Prue's first novel. On the back the words \\"original, fascinating, dark splendour, chilling, inventive, haunting, impressive, compelling\\" are splattered among a constellation of silver stars and I wouldn't like to argue with any of them. This is quite a short novel but it's beautifully written and packs a lot into its 136 pages, especially about the condition of being human.	2003-05-31

I'm very pleased to see so many reviews for them here. Clearly they are delighting readers of today as much as they delighted Matt and me.<br />Unfortunately, I read the second book first (probably because the first book wasn't in the library at the time and I didn't want to risk spoiling the single-volume edition I bought for Matthew). I was, therefore, disappointed in the first book., although there is actually nothing wrong with it. But even when I re-read the series I felt it didn't quite fit. It was as though it was intended as a stand-alone novel. I then discovered that Susan Cooper had written it for a competition where the entries had to be novels in the style of Edith Nesbitt. Possibly if I had read the books in their proper order I wouldn't have experienced this problem.<br />I thoroughly recommend this series (and, indeed, any book by Susan Cooper) to all fantasy-mad readers, whatever their age.	2002-12-09

Why? Well:<br />1. It's far too long--674 pages, which is adult length.<br />2. Athough it's marketed for young adults, it contains so many things that don't belong in a book for young adults: all those creatures more like humans than what they actually are--spiders who wear clothes, for instance. Such characters belong more in books for early middle-grade readers, and younger, than in a long novel for young adults.<br />4. Both children seem much older than they are, especially 5-year-old Brigit, who often seems a mature 12.<br />5. Both children are too young for a YA audience. There wasn't any plausible reason (as there was in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy) for this.<br />4. Pidge isn't a good name for a protagonist in a YA novel. It's more suitable for a young middle-grade audience.<br />However, despite these faults, this book is an enthralling read and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who loves a good story--whether you're adult, teenager or middle-grade reader.	2002-11-16

However, it's definitely an engrossing and convincing read, offering very good reasons  why the Ripper was never caught. I remember writing to Stephen Knight at least twice about his book. Yes, he did reply.<br />One can only be glad that photography wasn't all that good in Victorian days. The photo of the mutilated remains of Marie Kelly is bad enough in black and white. In colour it would definitely have sent me running for the bathroom. As for my nightmares, they would most likely have been ten times as  bad.

Unfortunately, despite the 2000 edition's claim of containing 250+ book publishers, the number I found suitable for a fantasy novel was pathetically small. A publisher for children that doesn't have a fantasy list has always seemed to me like a butcher shop without sausages, a hot bread shop without French loaves, a sweet shop without toffees ...<br />However, this is a publishing fault rather than a criticism of the book. My only criticism of the book itself is that you have to shelve out somewhere in the region of US$22 every year. Using last year's edition could land you up addressing your package to the wrong editor.	2002-07-21

My only quibble is that the author states, \\"For any age, fantasy is the hardest material to write, and even harder to sell.\\" Therefore, if fantasy is what you want to write, you won't find any help specifically related to your preferred genre in this book.<br />IS fantasy really harder to write than any other genre? I personally would find contemporary realism, with the almost obligatory dysfunctional family setting so beloved of today's publishers for older children, well near impossible to write, simply because I seldom enjoy reading it. However, good writing techniques are the same no matter what genre you write, and Lee Wyndham's suggestion to read the very best MODERN fantasy titles seems eminently sensible to me. I just disagree that would-be fantasy writers should learn their craft by writing here-and-now stories. If the mere thought of writing contemporary realism makes you want to yawn, you'll only land up writing a boring story.	2002-07-21

Apart from the fact that I found the series boring, I wondered if guns were really as accurate in Napoleon's time as they were portrayed. It seemed to me that every time someone fired a gun the bullet didn't just hit the targeted man but instantly killed him.	2001-10-26

But Sherryl Jordan actually wrote Secret Sacrament BEFORE The Raging Quiet. It was published in 1996 and shortlisted in the Aim Awards (as I think they were then called) for 1997. In my opinion it should have won not only the award for Best Book for Older Readers but should also have won overall Book-of-the-Year. But then I almost invariably find myself disappointed in the choices made by the judges of New Zealand's most prestigious annual book awards.  A recent addition to these awards is a children's choice. Unfortunately, instead of allowing children to choose from books published during the year, they're given ONLY the shortlisted books from which to choose. Not much better than Hobson's Choice, quite frankly. The children's choice is also invariably a picture book. I wish more encouragement would be given to readers who've gone beyond needing their fiction illustrated.<br /><br />Anyway, back to Secret Sacrament. It's a totally engrossing read for both teenagers and adults. You will never forget Gabriel and even adults will want to keep the book so they can rediscover its delights years later.	2001-05-10

Children of today who enjoy fantasy (i.e., Narnia and even Harry Potter) will enjoy The Box of Delights just as much. I can only suppose no publisher has thought to reissue it because the author is long-dead and was more noted as a poet than a children's writer.<br /><br />The BBC turned it into an excellent 6-part TV series which, although dated in its magical effects, is still extremely enjoyable. The production was also transferred to video tape (about three hours in length) and as far as I know is still available. We had no trouble obtaining our own copy a few years ago, anyway. In our house (where there are no children!) it has been viewed every Christmas ever since it was released on New Zealand television. With its 1930s Christmas setting of the English countryside shrouded in snow (and a wonderful story of villainy outwitted by children) it makes perfect Christmas viewing. But of course the book is always better than the movie! Borrow it from your library if  a copy is available there.<br /><br />Since I wrote this review the BBC television adaptation has become available on DVD and seems to have gathered quite a following. From reviews I see here, this seems to be an abridged version. Definitely make sure you get the original version!	2001-04-12

With its help we managed not to make mistakes with our purchases of spirits. Embury introduced us to one of the most enjoyable of all long drinks--the Collins family. Who wants a gin and tonic (though I must admit I still enjoy these) when you can have a Tom Collins?<br />And Embury is so right to include &quot;tons of ice&quot; in each recipe. It's amazing the difference plenty of ice makes to a drink. I always swirled an ice cube in the alcohol (and then discarded the ice cube) before mixing the drink. The mixer used also makes a lot of difference. So many of these (tonic water and ginger ales in particular) are far too sweet. (Anyone would think they were aimed at children!) Certainly nobody will want to mix a bottled lemonade with gin (or any other alcohol) after trying Embury's Collins recipes.<br />When we moved house four years ago and were sorting through our books, we found that our copy of this book was literally falling apart. There wasn't one page attached to another--though the book still had its cover. My husband wanted to throw it away (we didn't have money to spare for alcohol these days anyway) but I said &quot;No&quot;. He's recently started brewing his own spirits. They're not the equal of anything recommended by Embury, but they're nowhere near as bad as I'd feared. The brandy he produced for my Christmas pudding and Christmas mince pies certainly tasted like brandy and was even reasonably drinkable on its own. It will, he declared, improve with age. Certainly I've tasted commercially produced brandies a LOT harsher.<br />But I wonder what Embury would think of all this home distilled liquor? Maybe if his publisher decides to reissue the book Embury could update it to include home distilling kits.<br />Guess who is glad we didn't throw away this book? :-)	2000-12-09

Like Harry, Phelim is looked after by a cruel relative, in this case his sister Prudence. Prudence is clearly embittered by having to provide from her pitiful earnings for both her small brother and a father who appears to be in his dotage. (The father is no longer with them when the story starts. She tells Phelim he died, leaving Phelim believing he is an orphan--just one of her endless acts of verbal and psychological abuse.)<br /><br />There are many amusing characters in this book. Phelim has to find three others (the Maiden, the Fool and the Horse) to help him in his quest to save the world from dreadful monsters, the Hatchlings of the Stoor Worm, which are already creating terror and chaos. Sweeney, the Fool, is an extremely funny character whom you won't forget in a hurry, while I'm sure the 'Obby Oss' will prance through my dreams for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Geraldine McCaughrean has an amazing wit. Her humour runs circles around Joanne Rowling's. Also, she chooses her words with care, making every one count. Because of this, the reader has more sympathy for Phelim than for Harry Potter. In the end you will even feel a twinge of sympathy for the Stoor Worm.<br /><br />McCaughrean once said this book is more terrifying than she intended. It is certainly spine-chilling in parts. I had to read the chapter where Phelim destroys the Stoor Worm again and again; the writing is just so beautiful. And McCaughrean knows exactly when to 'tell' rather than 'show' for the right effect:<br /><br />'Phelim intercepted the paw with his hand and held it. The claws within its velvety feet were still soft. Enfeebled by the effort of hatching, it rested for a moment, globules of albumen slithering off its starry pelt, a panther but leopard-spotted with constellations of gold. It was beautiful.'<br /><br />Not 'Phelim caught his breath at its beauty' or anything similar; just that simple statement: 'It was beautiful'.<br /><br />Many adults (narrow-minded ones anyway) will no doubt criticise the way Geraldine McCaughrean deals with Prudence at the end of the book. But how else, we must ask ourselves, could Phelim escape the horrors of having to live with her? What would we do in Phelim's place?le statement: 'It was beautiful'.

I was lucky enough to have obtained a second-hand copy of Dogsbody (for NZ$3.50--about  US$1.75--and in extremely good condition) just before suffering from a  nasty bout of flu. Painkillers took care of the worst of the aches that  plagued every muscle I owned, while Diana Wynne Jones transported me from  my bed to another world, where Sirius the Dog Star is accused of murdering  a neighbouring luminary and is punished by being sent down to earth to live  as a dog, in which form he will die unless he can recover the mysterious  Zoi with which he is supposed to have committed his heinous crime.<br /><br />Apart  from having to cope with only dim memories of the star-world from which he  has fallen (not to mention a brain that keeps wanting to be just a dog's  brain!) Syrius has to face an impossible task in a form that places  enormous obstacles in his path: puppies are all too often dumped into the  river in sacks to drown; many dogs are tied up while their owners go to  work; fences are invariably too high to jump; and a dog's life-span is very  short. As if all this isn't bad enough, he has to overcome other-worldly  obstacles as well.<br /><br />Diana Wynne Jones must have been a dog in another  life--but certainly no ordinary dog. This is not just a book for children.  Adults of all ages, whatever their literary tastes, will enjoy it.	2000-06-27

She must have done an awesome amount of  research for this story, in which two girls, through the magic in a wishing  well, travel to a time which they fondly imagine to be better than their  own. Ada from 1891 wishes she lived a hundred years from then when women  would surely have the vote and the problems of the world will have been  solved, while in 1991 Amber, who has just heard her parents are divorcing,  wishes she lived a hundred years ago when parents didn't get divorced and  the problems of the world hadn't been invented. Fantasy is such a wonderful  medium for probing and highlighting problems of today which, if written as  realistic fiction, would be downright boring.
