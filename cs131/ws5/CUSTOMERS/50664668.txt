Ms. Campbell's book slams the childfree and the childless, using Bible verses--many incorrectly--in an attempt to prove her point.  She is affiliated with a fundamentalist Christian ministry that is anti-women's rights in any arena.  The author even includes a quote in the book that states that those who have no children are \\"useless\\" to society.  The list of \\"101 Reasons Why Mothers Love Having Children\\" paints a picture of parenting as always being worthwhile and rosy, instead of being realistic about what parenting really entails.  Avoid this book!	2004-03-29

Dr. Jeffers breaks down the truth about parenting.  It's not like The Brady Bunch or The Cosby Show!  There are a lot of overwhelming challenges and problems.  This book should be required reading for teens--maybe it would cut down on so many out-of-wedlock births.  It also should be read by anyone who is being told they &quot;are supposed&quot; to have children.  I love Dr. Jeffers' writing style.  She is straight forward without being overbearing.  This book totally cuts through the fantasies people have about parenting.	2003-09-09

Once the flashbacks started about Vivi and her Ya-Ya sisters, it got better.  In fact, the adventures of the Ya-Yas were more interesting than Sidda's story, which was the frame of the book.  The only male characters given a lot of attention are an old boyfriend of Vivi's, Vivi's dad, and Sidda's fiancee.  However, this is a woman's story, not only about a mother-daughter relationship, but some heartaches that women experience and men don't.	2002-04-02

I have worked for lawyers as an office support person myself, and could relate to the often inconsiderate and callous ways they treat employees on the bottom of the totem pole.  Later in the book, she goes into how to move up out of the pink-collar ghetto into being a paralegal.  However, everyone who's an office support person is not interested in pursuing a career in law.  Some office support persons are perfectly happy doing what they do for a living.  Not a bad book, but it doesn't offer much advice to office support personnel who work in other types of companies.	2002-01-11

I would have preferred that it had a little more information about some aspects of the computer such as email, but this book has a lot to cover.

At the end of each chapter, the reader is asked to record what they have learned from each book for future reference and on-going study. I would recommend this Bible for both beginners and long-time readers alike.	2001-12-14

I had been working full-time for years at that point (and attending college at the same time). However, the author presented this material as if it something that had never been done before.  I guess it would be a revelation to the twentysomethings that it's geared towards, esp. those with little to no work experience.  I don't knock most of the advice that's included in the book, however; it's needed, esp. for those who have no clue about office politics, sneaky co-workers and irritating bosses.<br />I think that some may get the impression from profiles of people in the book that it's easy to move up in the work place quickly.  Readers of the book should note that those folks are exceptions, not the norm, and many factors are involved in making a career.	2001-11-07

The Bible has clear instructions on how a husband is supposed to act towards his wife, but the author put the onus of obeying onto the wife's shoulders.  She's saying a grown woman should practically act as if she's her husband's child (and servant) instead of expressing her voice within the relationship.

I do not view the subject of submission the way the author does.  It appears that she lets men off of the hook from having to meet their wives halfway on different matters.  Men aren't being told to to compromise here; instead, their wives are told to do everything their husbands tell them to do, even if they know that it may not be the best solution at all times.
