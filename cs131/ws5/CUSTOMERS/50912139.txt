It's a directory of every server and network on the Internet before people knew what the Internet was and before the web existed.<br /><br />For the most part it's just a text directory with hostnames (or IP addresses), the admin and their phone number.  But the interesting part are the sprinkle of network maps that show all spokes of each network from college to college along with the connection speed of each line.  Please note this book lists all major domains: .MIL, .EDU, .GOV. etc.<br /><br />From a pre-internet aspect, it's very interesting, but outside of the maps themselves, the book doesn't hold much interest.	2005-07-18

It's loaded with (usefull) facts and info with everything you need to know from 0-3.  It's highly stylized and I understand why some people would call it a \\"coffee table book\\".  It's drawn up in a way that you can learn any fact in seconds.  No piece of writing ever goes beyond 3 sentences (the average is 2) but that's the beauty, it's free of \\"fluff\\" and \\"filler\\" material.<br />This book gives you hard facts on what you need to know, such as how much you'll spend in diapers,food,etc to percentages on what kinds of parents there are (percents of interracial couples, divorced, adopted, etc) and there is never a point where you'll feel overloaded with facts.<br />As a person who studios ease of use and intuitive designs I would put this book on a pillar.  They make what would normally be extremely boring or useless info and repackage it in a way that makes you want to read it and takes out the useless crap often found in fact like books.<br />After skimming this book, I can say I would probably never need to read another book on baby finance, basic health, care, how to raise, baby phsycotherapy, etc.<br />This is a must have for any soon-to-be mother or father.	2004-04-26

The writing style is interesting but the book is split up so that it's not exactly in order of group or events which makes for a hard to follow timeline, assuming you care about timeline.<br />I am a big fan of Coil's recent music but have little interest in their art or personal life.<br />If your a fan of any group in this book, it's probably worth a read.	2003-08-22

So when I needed a MSS-QL design book I figured I'd give them a try, especially after their good reviews on this book.<br />Leave it to say I'm very dissapointed.  I own well over 100 tech books and this is by far the most wordy book I've read.  This extra detail of wordiness does not offer some great insight into the subject but seems to serve as a way for the author(s) to turn what should be a 250 page book into a long and boring 600 page read.<br />I prefer books that get &quot;right to the point&quot;.  Theory is good and all but not in excessiveness.  What it really boils down to is time, this book doubles my pacing and doesn't offer more in the line of education.  If I wanted to read something big, I'll buy 'War &amp; Peace'.<br />Bigger is NOT always better.	2003-04-14

This book is just right as it explains C# without insulting you on what a loop means.  One thing I really liked about this book is that while it quickly shows you how to use Visual Studio.NET it doesn't pretend to be a VS.NET tutorial like how many .NET books do, including many Microsoft books.

This book ranks #1 in my favorite of all the health books, a fun read, very informative and he touches on the more technical aspects (something I like to hear about).  This book is perfect in every fashion and I hope he plans on updating and re-releasing the book in 2002 or 2003 with all the new information and studies that have been performed on carotenoids, phytochemicals and the millions of other substances in fruits and vegatables thats are still being research.<br />The only negative thing I can say about this book is that Timothy repeats the same info in different chapters and that he doesn't mention that some of the vitamins/minerals/herbs when taken at their optimal dosages can have side effects (such as the optimal dosage of Ginko Bilboa causes headches, the same for ginseng) and he totally missed the fact that ginseng should be taken for a 3 weeks, then stopped for a week or two, then started again.<br />After reading this book thouroughly I can seriously say anybody interested in good health information, this book is a must read.

Like many others are saying about this book it has two major flaws, the  first is that it lacks an index, while it does have a table of contents, if  you need to look up a specific command you can't.  The second, and more  important, problem is that this book doesn't describe the functions in a  usable fashion.  In fact the printing of the function is sometimes longer  than the description itself, they rarely go beyond 5 words.  While some  functions do not need a lengthy explanation, others do.  This book isn't  all bad, earlier on it does explain (in full sentences/paragraphs, wow!)  about form handling, database integration, variables, bolean, and the  basics like  while/do and if/then.  Like every other O'Reilly pocket  reference, these mini books are only good as a reference, not as a sole  learning tool so if you purchase this book, I sure hope you bought a full  sized PHP book.	2000-09-14

Instead of simply telling you not to run a certain service cuz it  might have a hole, it actually tells you what the hole is, how to exploit  it, and where to get the tools you need to exploit it.  This isn't a list  of programs and their holes though, it starts at the begining teaching you  how to enumarate (get info) from a computer from all kinds of different  methods, such as trying to find out OSs, their versions, services that are  running and who is currently on the system.  It talks about scanning groups  of computers to find the few that are exploitable.  It then goes on to  explain specific Windows9X holes, then NT, to Novell, and then to Unix.  Spending upto 60 pages on each operating system (very in depth and all of  it usefull).  There are also chapters just on dialup and VPNs (virtual  private networks), firewalls, network hardware (routers) and an entire  chapter just about DoS's (Denial of Services).  It then goes into Advance  Techniques, problems with PHP and ASP, and then onto a chapter on  Windows2000 (talk about being up to date).  As far as my book collection  goes, this definetly gets my Top5 rating of the 100+ books I've read.  Theres alot of meat to eat in this book.	2000-09-14

This is NOT one of those books, it does a good job of going through XML.  But it does so more as a normal book does than trying to be an actually  &quot;small reference&quot;.  This little book is good enough for you to  actually learn XML by reading cover to cover.  The concepts covered in it  are: unlearning bad habits, xml overview, DTD, XSL, formatting, XLink and  XPointers.  The only bad thing I have to say is that I notices a couple  table of contents items point to a page just before or after the subject  they want to point you towards, but thats trivial anyways.	2000-09-14

After  it shows you how to make the texture, it then gives 2 or 3 examples on how  to make alterations to create differnt types of the same texture.

It then goes on to  discuss things like pattern matching, emacs, troffm sedm awk, make, sccs.  And considering this book costs a mere $10 retail its a steal.

But as far as nerdy computer details, it sometimes lacks.  Almost  never does the book explain an actualy working idea such as &quot;common  web security holes&quot;.  It is more like a rewritten version of a  webserver explaination or a firewall but doesn't explain where and how such  things can be insecure.

This book is a bible for begining or intermediate graphic designers who want to make the perfectly organized data (newsletters, website, newspaper, etc).

It covers PGP and how it works (not  jsut what it is), SSL, TLS, login security, CGI security (they give actual  code examples not ideals), hardware based security such with things like  smart cards.  There is also a chapter that explains what to do after you  have been broken into and explains your legal routes of actions also.  I  also liked the fact that there is a chapter that explains the author's  route of actions while working at an ISP .  This book is a good buy if you  need to learn about security and e-commerence and all the options you have  relating to security.  I've read alot of books, and its rare to find a book  that explains things and also gives technical details.  I know I'm not the  only person who is sick of seeing every book being written for people who  have never used a computer before and do not give code examples and real  world implimentation.  The only bad thing I have to say about this book is  that there isn't a chapter that explains creating your own encryption  method for Perl/C/PHP/ASP or the math behind it, but the material they do  have does a good job of getting you very near this subject.	2000-02-07

I'd also like to make a comment  about a previos review from a guy called 'archie'.
