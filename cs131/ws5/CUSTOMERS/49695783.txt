Rather it slowly sucks you into the story with wonderful analogies, good charachter description and a  flat out good sports story to tell. <br /> <br />It is the story of a baseball dreamer who decides to explore the sport first had running a bankrupt team in habited by an interesting roster of charachters.  Whats great is that the author seems to know going in, that the business, money, and personell  side of baseball will be a rough ride that might tarnish his school boy image of the sport.  But he takes the plunge anyway _ almost as if saying I love this sport so much I want to see it all _ good bad and funny. <br /> <br />It has a happy ending too.	2005-08-10

At the Post: The 20th Century in Sports from Famed Washington Post:  Columnist Shirley Povich	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Great Look Back at 7 Decades of Sports	I grew up in Washington reading Shirley Povich regularly. I read him for about 20 years in the Post.  The interesting footnote to that is that he had \\"retired\\" before I ever started reading his columns! <br /> <br />The scope of this work is breathtaking.  How many journalists coverd the 1924 Senators World Series as well as their last game in 1971.  Oh and for good measure he covered the start of the Tiger Woods era as well.  Did I mention he caddied for President Harding? <br /> <br />In an age when sports writers spend more time getting ready to be witty for ESPN shows, this book offers a wonderful insight into an era when sports writers worked a beat and REPORTED as well as offered commentary (and were actually writers).  And Povich did both in a simple, straightforward style that was easy to digest with the morning coffee. <br /> <br />His opinions were straighforward too and he tackled tough issues like racisim in sports, long before other sribes in the press box dared take a side on a controversial subject. <br /> <br />The book is well edited with some nice historical context given to many of the works.  Can't wait for Vol. 2, after all he wrote about 20,000 columns during his 74 year career at the post	2005-08-03

It takes us briefly into the lives of the Marines of one unit.  It details where they came from and how they came together in a desert town in Iraq and most importantly how one brief moment in time - and one Marines gut reaction to protect the Marines next to him - changed all their lives. <br /> <br />A very good read. <br /> <br />	2005-08-02

No, his books move slower and more methodically.   <br /> <br />But in the end his books, this title included, leave the reader with a satisfied feeling.  A feeling that they have gotten an in depth look, with thorough reporting and a sometimes unique perspective, at a sports issue. <br /> <br />The beauty of \\"Open\\" is that this event was widely reported on and covered by the media at the time of the U.S. Open.  But the author's reporting starts us on this jpurney decades earlier and shows us many more reasons why this particular U.S. Open was an historic and dramatic event, aside from the obvious answers that are already known. <br /> <br />He merges the players on the course with the players behind the scenes who made the event happen.  He shows the history of the financing of the U.S. Open and how that has evolved.  His wrttting is crisp and clear and he sets the scenes in the book nicely with important details about key figures that help the reader appreciate their role in the events even more. <br /> <br />This book should appeal greatly to the golf fan and have a slightly broader appeal to those who enjoy good reporting from behind the scenes of major news events.	2005-04-28

It is a well reported and straightforwardly written story that should freighten us all.  Jed Horme does a nice job of setting the stage in New Orleans by a well written background about the role of poverty and wealth in this racially diverse but also racially divided city. <br /> <br />The author's writing is not overly suspenseful, nor does it overwhelm the story that is being told.  it is straight forward and to the point allowing the story to move itself along through the many unusual turns of the case. <br /> <br />Overall a good read and I also recommend \\"A promise of Justice\\" and \\"Bloodsworth\\" for those who enjoy this book.	2005-04-03

Thorough research, crisp writing, and a flare for the well told tale.  Erik Larson does it again and follows up Issac's Storm with another historical suspense novel that read like the best fiction. <br /> <br />Set amongst the Chicago world's fair in the late 1800s, Larson's research and writing offer teh reader a great insight into America's second city just prior to the turn of the last century. He captures well to feelings of the city and of the organizers of the fair and all that everyone hoped it would be.  But that story is reflectd in the dark side of the fair that is a killer stalking his victims. <br /> <br />Larson is a great story teller and is really carving out a great niche with these non-fiction work set around this time frame.	2005-04-03

It is hard to break away as the author takes into the lives of the people on this small plane and the others whose lives were impacted by this crash. <br /> <br />The author's paced the writing in this book perfectly taking us both into the plane and outside as it becomes apparent to both the reader and the passengers that their lives are plummeting out of control from several thousand feet in the sky. <br /> <br />Since I have fear of flying I probably should not have read this book, because it really puts you inside the cockpit and passenger cabin as you wonder how the crash will occur and who will survive. <br /> <br />This is a pwerful book about how humans cause tragdy and respond to it.

It is an incredible testimony of human will, faith and perseverence. <br /> <br />Thankfully, Ralston is not a bad story teller either. A few areas drag, but generallt Ralston moves the story along nicely, jumping from his predicament to the search for him just enough to build suspense. He manages to tell much of the story with amazing humor, however the actual passage where he finally frees himself will have you squirming and grabbing for your own arm just to make sure. <br /> <br />I listened to an unabrided CD version and found myself having to stop the CD or pullover at some of the dramatic points. <br /> <br />overal a well done job.	2005-03-31

But the book was slow to get going and I suspect a non-bebaseball fan will not be patient enough to stick with it.  <br /> <br />However, this book lacks the wider appeal that made the two aorementioned books so popular.  The writing dragged some and several scenes seemed endlessly detailed, with little reward at the end of the section. <br /> <br />The upside of the book is that the author gives us great insight into the work of a baseball manager and its many facets that are often unseen, or at least usually forgotten. Additionally, some details around the game time situations are wonderful and they keep the story going. <br /> <br />This book will appeal to baseball fans and will have very strong appeal to St. Louis fans. <br />	2005-03-28

Some portions were needlessly long, only to reveal small insights into the problems at the company. <br /> <br />In a related note, if you are interested in a book that offers a very fresh perspective on the Enron mess (although no inside information) I highly recommend \\"The Tao of Enron.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-25

But the pace picked up and I think the author did a good job of connecting us to the victims of the crime and putting us right there at the scene with them.  <br /> <br />Even though the author is related to the victims, she did a fair job of background and perspective on the perpetrators of the crime.  A significant amount of the book is devoted to aftermath of the event to help explain the impact on the victims. <br /> <br />overall this is a quite well done book for a first work from a young author.	2005-03-25

For those who are fans of this genre they will find the mystery itself and the people sho demanded these deaths be prosecuted, despite the inital lack of police interest, to be the substance that carries this book. <br /> <br />The author did his homework and wrote the book in a straight forward fashion that neither gets in the way of the story nor overly dramatizes the tale.  The background info on the central charachters is adequate, but there were times I would have liked to have them flushed out some more. <br /> <br />I think the book does justice to prosecutor Doug Gansler, who really carried the ball on the case when it would have been just as easy to decline. <br /> <br />	2005-03-19

Unless you believe in reincarnation, it is possbly the only way we can have a second go at life. <br /> <br />But finally, we realize Coleman's book is really a story about narcisism (sic).  Because while we all might have a quick fantasy about starting over, normally balanced people do not act on such fantasies and as we see in the main charachter, those who do act are deeply troubled.	2005-03-09

So many people try and compare running a political organization like a mayor's office and city government to be ing a company CEO, but this book shows that the comparison is shallow becuase city residents - especially in our urban centers - want much more from a city than customers want from a company.  there is an emotional attachment to one's city. <br /> <br />The book is very well written and moves along at a nice pace, while still taking time to show the details of people's lives that make us care for them and make their charachters come alive. <br /> <br />	2005-02-26

And this card counting team is run out of MIT like an intramural activity. <br /> <br />Well paced, well told story that makes for a hard to put down book.	2005-02-26

It is a well reported, well written account of how someone's life can so quickly spin out of control  A story of how a few police oversights and corner cutting can result in a rush to judgement. <br /> <br />The author also covers well the human toll taken on the falsly accused.  The ending encounter between the prosecutor and formerly accused is a powerful passage that is well written and captures the emotional toll - on both sides of the case - that is so often lacking from books about true crime. <br /> <br />	2005-02-25

Can there be such a thing as a funny true crime story? <br /> <br />Mark Bowden answers the question with a solid yes, with this tale of down and out Philidelphians whos stumble upon a box of armored car money. <br /> <br />It s aquick read that takes time to delve into the backgrounds of the major charachters enough to make us sympathetic to them and even pitty them at times.  Well reported and not overwritten, which must have been ahrd because some of the charachters cried out for a lot of sterotypical descriptions.	2005-02-25

But while the reporting was the author's usual detailed chronoligical tale, I found the abundance of names and multiple locations of LDS settlements a little hard to keep straight and keep interested in.  The author has clearly reached some conslusons about the LDS church and some of them are well founded, however sometimes I felt his writing was needlessly crtical of the church. <br /> <br />Into the Wild is still his best book, althought Into Thin Air is a close second.	2005-02-24

What we learn is that while the journey is probably necessary, there are really no terms to be found.  No answers that will make dad say \\"wow, now I understand.\\" <br /> <br />But that does not mean the journey should not be under taken. His acount of handeling the weapon that killed his son is as powerful a passage as there can be. <br /> <br />The book starts slower than it reads later in the text.	2005-02-24

The reporting was thorough and the writing clear and fast paced.<br /><br />Its hard to imagine that an event so widely reported on by so many journalists, could still be written about in such a moving and even suspensful way.  As the reader learns about those inside the towers he becomes attached to some through the authors' insights into their lives and soon you find yourself rooting for their escape or rescue.<br /><br />Aside from the gripping reporting of the human side of the response inside the tower, the authors fairly point out some of the problems that made escape and rescue inside the World Trade Center difficult.<br /><br />A highly recommended read.	2005-02-21

I remember thinking: \\"This book has some important lessons and it needs widespread distribution.\\"  Thank goodness a major publisher picked it up because this story needs to be told far and wide. <br /> <br />Sports play and integral part of the American youth experience.  From pee wee soccer to college gridirion.  Finally some coaches have put the proper perspective on youth and sports and its role in the larger society.  Author Marx captures their story quite well and his reporting and writing is clear and crisp. <br /> <br />This book should be required reading for every high school football coach. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-24

While the book makes no earthshattering theological revelations, the generally concise text poses some important questions about Abraham is an engaging style that mizes interviews, historical travels and author commentary and observation.	2004-10-24

Until this book I was unfamiliar with the 1916 shark attacks on the Jersy shore.  The author did a good job of not only reporting the incidents and relating the relevent shark science, but also of capturing the sense of place for the vacation beaches of 1916 and giving us some background and feel for the victims.	2003-11-15

For those looking for a medical mystery this book will probably not be very satisfying. The point of this book, which is made several times and then some, is that the response from federal agencies to the 2001 anthrax attacks was not perfect.  And those mistakes cost lives.<br />The history of US anthrax production was interesting and offered perspective, and the chapter on the US Justice Departments attack and smear of a scientist was good and should have been developed more.	2003-11-09

Take one of the greatest inventions of the 20th Century and breakdown the framework that lead to its creation.<br />The book is well researched and the author's conclusions about the Wright Brothers appear to be firmly grounded in fact and history.  My only criticisim, and it is minor, is the book would have been a 5-star if the author had included more modern business management examples to support his 7 problem solving techniques. Curent business solution stories that parallell the Wright Brothers techniques would have really hammered the points home.<br />Overall, excellent book.	2003-11-09
US	49695783	R3UVBIUEUTN4KB	0375413030	696613642	A Trial by Jury	Books	2	11	13	N	N	Aargh!! Keep academics off your jury	This book is painfully overwritten and the greatest blessing is its short length.<br />As a trial attorney I give it two stars because it does cover an interesting topic and a murder that is typical in its quirkiness.<BR>But the story could have been told much more compellingly if the author had taken time after the trial (or during deliberations for that matter) to find out his fellow jurors true thoughts on the matter.  As it turns out the book portrays the verdict as somewhat a trial by a judge .. with Judge D. Graham Burnette presiding.<br />For those who are fans of the courtroom drama or true crime novels, this is not your flavor.  More autobigraphical and introspective than insightful into discovering the truth of the crime or what the other jurors really thought.	2003-10-25

Part rural, part tourist, and part developers dream.

The reporting is well put together and reads smoothly.
