I love to be read to, and I love filling up the time on a long commute with a story.  I hate abridgements, I hate readers who ham things up, and I hate productions that feel the need to underscore the mood with music cues (taking attention away from the story).  A great performance can make a poor story interesting, and make a great story shine. <br /> <br />In every respect that I can think of, Lenny Henry's reading of Neil Gaiman's \\"Anansi Boys\\" is the standard which every audiobook should reach for. <br /> <br />THE STORY <br />is excellent.  Neil has given us something of a comedy of manners, a family story that is very much a comedy in the P.G. Woodehouse mode (except with supernatural beings, their progency, those who love them, and their blogging roommates). Its one of those tight stories that take the time to show you what's going on and still astonishes.  I'm not going to take up too much more time gushing on this front.  Let's end this section with the fact that I had more fun reading this book than anything else I've read in a couple of years. <br /> <br />THE PERFORMANCE <br />is what I really wanted to mention.  Lenny Henry SHINES!  His pace is easy and not too rushed.  His accents (Carribean, American, English; and regional/cultural subsets of each) are good without being camp.  And most importantly, he offers a dozen or so exact, distinctive, age appropriate and recognizable voices for each character. <br /> <br />I cannot stress that last one enough.  One must sympathize with the difficult task of one voice coming up with all these voices.  Some audiobooks solve the problems by having more than one reader or just having the reader read in their own voice and use cues in the text (\\"...said Virginia hotly\\") to fill in the blanks. Other books too are first person narratives that lend themselves better to audiobooks. <br /> <br />Far too often, though, an actor will exaggerate something tocreate a distinctive voice for a character (ESPECIALLY a male reader reading a woman's part).  It is painful to hear someone adding an inappropriate speech impedement or something like a southern drawl just so that the listener can tell characters apart.   <br /> <br />Lenny avoids all of these pitfalls without the need of crutches.  In a third-person situation telling a sprawling (if short) tale in three different countries, his performance is masterful.  10 hours never flew by so fast. <br /> <br />I'm now going to purchase other audiobooks he's read just so I can hear him!	2005-10-13

Sandra Boynton is without a doubt a superstar among writers for children's books.  Her books are great entertainments for our kids and they definitely foster a love of books. <br /> <br />In my humble opinion, this is Boynton's best book.  The conceit of the book is that it is seven stories, each a page long.  PERFECT for 18m to 3yo.  In these seven short pages, you get a counting story, a lullaby, a kid-participation story, an animal snoring story with funny noises, a pajama story, a dinosaur-yawning story, etc.  All of them are fun, all of them are sleep-oriented, and they all point to one place: bed. <br /> <br />Everything is underscored with Boynton's playful sense of humor and her adorable drawings.  Over the last two years, this book has been in heavy rotation at bedtime and we're not tired of it. <br /> <br />I think all of Boynton's books are great, but this one is really wonderful.  Highly, highly, highly recommended!	2005-09-30

Many different writers have thrown out many different definitions with the purpose of being about to give a definitive up-or-down yes-or-no to any particular story.  Altered Carbon makes me think about such debates because it is first and foremost a hard-boiled mystery that calls back to Raymond Chandler and the old black and white films of the 30s and 40s.  How to breathe life into this old genre?  Set the story in the future.  Along comes Philip K. Dick and *poof* you've got a new subgenre: future-noir.  And now, 40 years later, future-noir is getting a little grey around the edges.  With Altered Carbon, Richard Morgan doesn't quite re-invent the genre but he offers a compelling addition to its ranks.   <br /> <br />Altered Carbon is roughly 5 parts The Big Sleep, and 1 part Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?, with a couple of pinches of over-the-top action thrown in for good measure.   If you're looking for a mystery, here you go.  If you're looking for science-fiction, well... read on. <br /> <br />The flaw of this book is that the *idea* behind it is at odds with the *story*.  The idea that a person's entire identity and all their memories can be downloaded digitally and transferred from body to body goes against everything we know about neurology, but that would be forgivable if it was the centerpiece of a good story.  Unfortunately, Morgan is so focused on giving his readers a good Mystery, that the sci-fi aspects falter.  There are other needling sci-fi aspects too that could have gotten more play: the role of the central character's conditioning, just how sentient are artificial beings, etc. <br /> <br />Because the action is so focused on the whodunnit, the story only occasionally offers some human ramifications.  When you're done, you can't help but think of all the missed opportunities.  There's lots of examination of seedy sex and ultra-violence, but there is not a lot of the wonder in gee-whiz technology that gives sci-fi a lot of its charm.  Dick was always asking the big questions in his stories (what does it mean to be human, what is reality if not perception, what is the role of technology in our evolution) without letting the stories become brooding meditions.  But here, the questions mostly go unasked. <br /> <br />As you might guess, the flaws to the book kept me from fully enjoying it.  That's not to say it isn't a good book or that you won't enjoy it.  Because it is a good book, especially if you're a fan of those old hard-boiled Philip Marlowe books.  Sci-Fi flaws aside, Morgan definitely does breathe new life into the mystery side of things.  The plot of the book has twists and turns aplenty and will keep you guessing until the end.  And if that's your thing, and you don't mind a little bit of the old ultra-violence, then pick it up.	2005-04-26

Many consider Goethe the greatest German writer and Faust his masterwork.  300 years old and we are still reading and learning from it.  It is an excellent read. <br /> <br />I am inspired to write this review because of Walter Kaufmann's excellent and (to read reviews) misunderstood translation.  Kauffman's intentions are stated clearly in his introduction.  Meter and rhyme are preserved as much as possible, and all the text that is translated (all of part one and sections of part two) is done exactingly without one line added or removed.  Kaufmann's goal was to 1&#62; re-create the rhythmic drive of Goethe's wit, 2&#62; create a *readable* translation not just for the scholar but for the reader as well, 3&#62; provide an exacting translation that avoids the embellishments of prior translations. <br /> <br />It should go without saying that any translation that doubles the length of a speech or replaces subtle humor with flowery speech is a poor one. <br /> <br />Kaufmann, unlike many other translators, has both the knowledge of German and an appreciation for cultural context to reach all of those goals.  While this translation might not be the best for scholars (since much of Part Two is trimmed), it is the best translation for *readers*.	2004-09-08

What if you were whisked away to another world? This is the premise of a thousand fantasy yarns out there, but think about it for a second: Why is it that all those protagonists have little trouble with the transition? Right now you're sitting in front of your computer reading this, what if when you turned around you were temporarily blinded and began to hear voices? You'd think that you were crazy, wouldn't you? <br />Now, what if you had a terminal disease and when this worldshift happened, you were magically cured?  Well then you'd KNOW you were crazy. Right? <br />What would you do? <br />This is the crux of Thomas Covenant. Thomas, a leper, is having a very a tough time in the real world. I'm not giving away anything that isn't in the first chapter, but as the book starts his wife has taken their kid and divorced him, nobody wants to have anything to do with him, and he is having to fight with despair at every turn. <br />When crossing the street he faints--or something--and finds himself in THE LAND. Thomas is quite sure dismay has sent him around the bend, he's gone nuts, and he makes the decision not to believe his own senses. He is, as the title suggests, The Unbeliever. <br />Our Protagonist is a very dark character indeed. Admit it, you'd have a similar reaction, wouldn't you? Since Covenant doesn't believe in The Land, does his actions there have any consequences? He commits some very dark acts at the beginning of his time in the land, then spends the next thousand or so pages regretting it. Enough said. <br />What pulls this trilogy off, though, is not Mr. Unbeliever, but The Land and the people in it. SRD does quite an amazing job of creating a beautiful world full of magic and heroism and its own ancient history. <br />Donaldson is one of the few fantasy writers fit to be mentioned in the same league as J.R.R. Tolkein, someone who he obviously studied and, I suspect, worked hard not to imitate. If that's the case then he succeeded, for The Land and its peoples are as wonderful as Middle-Earth while having almost nothing in common with them. And this is the central conflict of the book, something that is guaranteed to grab you and hold on to you: because pretty soon, YOU are rooting for The Land, you care about it more than Covenant does, and you keep waiting for Thomas to come up with a better answer for his unbelief. <BR>I don't want to go into detail on story, but SRD is quite aware that you've read Lord of the Rings and he works hard to make this interesting and something you won't expect. Again, it is dark. Covenant is at constant war with his unbelief even as those around him fight to protect him and protect The Land. <br />I guarantee this: If you can get over the darkness of it (Lord Foul is quite aptly named, and there are plenty of foul deeds in the trilogy), you will read and reread these books with fervor. I'll never forget the thrill I had reading The Power That Preserves. <br />Now that Donaldson has announced that he's writing the final books in this series after some 30-odd years, I'm going to be picking this up again.  &quot;The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot; will probably not be out before 2005, but it is currently being written.<br />____________________<BR>The second trilogy doesn't reach the heights of the first, and downright clunks in the middle, but I still recommend it.<BR> <BR>Reviews for each of the books:<BR>Lord Foul's Bane: A<BR>The Illearth War: A+<BR>The Power That Preserves: A+<BR>The Wounded Land: A<br />The One Tree: C<BR>White Gold Weilder: A <br />Enjoy!	2003-05-07

Lawrence Ritter gets the job done by getting out of the way and letting the greats of the game from 1900s-1930s tell their stories.  Review after review of this book calls it the best baseball book ever and let me add my voice to that chorus.<br />Baseball in the deadball era when the fences were so far out that the league leading home run hitter hit 4 home runs; all of them inside the park runs.  Baseball when you got one ball to play with.  Fred Snodgrass' story *alone* is worth the price of the book, but you also get to hear what it was like to play with Walter Johnson, Babe Ruth (with the Red Sox), lots of dirt on Ty Cobb and Christey Matthewson.......<br />Each of these stories is like a summer day and makes you feel like grabbing a ball and mitt and heading outside.<br />What else is there to say?

US	43586748	RNK1J6EFH235P	0761121323	874075168	What to Expect When You're Expecting	Books	5	597	684	N	N	Complete + Professional + Non-Judgemental = All You Need	When we decided to get pregnant, we read something like 25 books.  One year and one baby later, I kind of feel like an expert in baby books.  So let me say that this book is far and away the best pregnancy book and it is no surprise that it has been a bestseller for many years.<br />This book is a complete, professional, non-judgemental reference.  A lot of books try too hard to be funny or cute. WTE is not humorless, but it deals with subject matter in a refreshingly straightforward way. The advice and help given echoes what our doctors have said and answered most of our questions before we even saw our Obstetritian (no, it's not a substitute). <br />This book covered EVERYTHING.  It answered all our questions about diet, medication, flu shots, cat ownership, false labor, vitamin supplements, cramps, ultrasound, breastfeeding or how to judge your OB/GYN.  All the answers were in here, along with tons of other stuff we didn't think about until we came across it here. <br />Most importantly, this book isn't judgemental. There are a ton of controversial issues associated with pregnancy (medication, breast feeding, circumcision).  Lots of books out make a lot of assumptions about religion, single parents, \\"modern times\\" or they just avoid some issues entirely. This book assumes you can make up your own mind once you're presented with all the information. This book wasn't a replacement for our doctors, but it gave us a lot of really useful information without taking a side.<br />If the book has a flaw, it is the diet section.  Do yourself a favor and skip that section.  In all fairness, this is a flaw of a lot of the books we read (some of them reading like 1950s \\"Keep Young And Beautiful\\" rants). Our doctor gave us a 10 page handout that gave us all the information we needed.  <br />Like I say, we read a lot of pregnancy books.  It's pretty shocking how many we found to be completly WORTHLESS! I don't want to name names, and I've already written a couple of negative reviews, but I'm thinking particularly of the ones full of Erma Bombeck-esque anecdotes about La Maz classes, the \\"staying chic while you're pregnant\\" fashion mag type, the old-fashioned preachy church-lady books, or--worst of all--the \\"nutrition\\" books that focused almost entirely on weight. Some of these books are written by people with no medical qualifications at all! <br />A good rule of thumb: if the author has no medical qualifications, the book will be useless from a medical standpoint.  Would you allow a fashion magazine editor to make up your mind about having an epidural?<br />Just about every pregnancy book uses the \\"What Nobody Will Tell You\\" tagline. Once you've read this book, there will be very few surprises left. There isn't a topic that isn't touched on and just about everything you need is covered in depth. That's not to say this is the only book you need, but it goes a long, long way.<br />I'm only harping on this because I was pretty shocked to read some of the negative reviews that complained about WTE containing a lot of information on rare pregnancy situations, saying that such information was \\"scary\\" and \\"unnecessary\\". WTE gives plenty of information on what is serious as opposed to what is a false alarm.  Nobody PLANS on having a troubled pregnancy!  Aren't you better off knowing what's involved and how to detect and prevent such things?  I suppose for some people ignorance is bliss, but we were MUCH happier being prepared.  When we went into labor 5 weeks early, we felt at least somewhat prepared for it because it was extensively covered in the book!<br />If you're looking for entertainment, pick up something else or rent a movie.  But if you're looking for a complete, professional, and useful reference book, What To Expect While You're Expecting is THE BEST and it will be the standard for years to come.	2003-04-09

Look, I can understand why you'd want to read this book. \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\" was a gem of a science fiction book.  Maybe it was a little short on character development, but with such a wonderful world to explore, who cares?  Around every corner of the exploration were wonders... flights over a cylindrical sea, biots, mile-long stairways... Wasn't it great? Didn't you feel like you were reading the journals of explorers who themselves felt like ants in a cathedral?  Didn't the whole book just blow your mind?<br />Well you WON'T find any of those virtues in this book or any of the sequale that follow.<br />Gentry Lee seems to have been given the seemingly impossible task of making RAMA--a space-bourn Grand Canyob-sized artifact of an alien culture--a boring place.  What's his secret?  He filled Rama with insipid caricatures straight from a 20th century soap opera. <br />Remember that heroic group from the first book that pulled together in the face of catastrophe?  Gone!  Rama II and it's sequals leave us with short-sighted bureaucrats, beautiful-but-power-mad Italian women, impossibly altruistic scientists, amoral lawyers, American corporate types who want to use Raman technology to create new weapons (boy, that's not cliche!), cowboy presidents, the pope, African-American gangsters, chess-playing Russians, oversexed teens, murderously jealous lovers, and a computer geek who overcomes his social ineptness to save the day and win the girl (Gentry Lee, not surprisingly, is a computer guy). <br />Maybe Clarke and Lee were worried that Commander Norton and his crew were all cut from the same \\"noble scientist\\" cloth that many of Clarke's characters use. If so, they overcompensated drastically. A spear-toting Eskimo or a peg-legged pirate wouldn't seem out of place in this group, but an intelligently written character would.<br />Most of the gaggle of Knots Landing rejects don't care at all about Rama II and since the book focuses on their bickering, their pregnancies,and their murders, neither will you. <br />After this one the books actually get worse. And by the time the Ramans reveal themself you (and conincidentally enough, many of the characters) are completly indifferent.<br />If you've read \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" and haven't read this book yet, then please please PLEASE don't read it!  <br />You'll be sorry you did.	2002-11-12

All of the tenants of excellent fantasy are there. Jordan is a great writer who builds an incredible world with a compelling history. In this book, Jordan gets the balance of history, character, exposition and action right.<br />Shadow Rising is a treasure, but be warned: as of this writing Jordan hasn't finished WOT. By the end of this book, the series is MOVING and you are riding through at a great clip. You cannot WAIT to find out what happens next, so you HAVE to continue.  Unfortunately, Jordan doesn't pick up the pace and from here on things start to slow down.<br />My guess is the end of this series isn't going to happen until 2006 (I believe there are going to be 12 books, but I don't think there's an official word).<br />Is it going to be worth it? I don't think so. WOT has gotten very complicated and is becoming turgid. Sometime around Book 6, the action began to crawl. Book 8 (the last one I read) was almost 700 pages and took place over three days! BUT there are those who say there's light at the end of the tunnel. Book 9 is supposed to be head and shoulders above Book 8.<br />Is Robert Jordan the Van Halen of fantasy writers, starting off with a bang then fading off into mediocrity? Or is he the Rush of fantasy writers, high highs and low lows but not giving up and always working on making it better?<br />I've read the first five books twice now beacuse it is too difficult to wait a year between reading books. (And he's coming out with them once every three years at this point!!).<br />My advice is to wait until Jordan's finished them all. The books are complex enought that you are much better off reading them one right after another. Especially since there are books where one or more of the main characters don't even appear! <br />By the time he finishes, we'll knowif it was worth the wait.<br />You've been warned!<br />My grade for the series:<BR>1.

Now as then, it packs a wallop.<br />Those reviews calling it a satire are being a little misleading. This book actually IS a self-help book. In fact, it is probably the only self-help book out there. <br />While traditional self-help books are full of answers and leave little to question, this one is full of questions and almost entirely empty of answers.

And maybe, just maybe, there are things in our lives that distract us from even asking those important questions.<br />Are we lost?  Not if we're enjoying the journey.<br />I don't want to go into any more detail. This book is something I have a difficult time talking about to other people. I feel like I have an intimate relationship with it that is difficult to describe to the casual outsider. The relationship was a little frustrating at times, but is now the kind of satisfying thing that has become a part of my life that has enriched me.<br />Fans of the work of Tom Robbins will know what I'm talking about when I say that this book is deadly serious and frivolously playful all at the same time.<br />Let's just say that with the sole exception of \\"What Color Is Your Parachute\\", this is the only self-help book out there that helped me.

As I type this, I'm listening to Fred Wilpon talk about how Art Howe is going to turn the Mets around. This after the 2002 Mets, the team with the third highest payroll in baseball, finished last in the National League East.<br />My thoughts, naturally, turn to this book.<br />At the end of the abyssmal 1992 season for the New York Mets, Bob Klapisch and John Harper--beat writers for the NY Post and NY Daily News--felt the need to rant, to give the fans the necessary information to answer the question \\"how could this have happened?\\" The highest payrolled team in the history of baseball, the team that made Bobby Bonilla the highest paid player ever, finished with the third lowest record in the National League. I mean, we had David Cone, Dwight Gooden and Sid Fernandez in our starting rotation! We got Bobby Bonilla to replace Darryl Strawberry! That ring should have been ours!<br />Any Met fan reading the above knows what happened on the surface (and what continued to happen in 1993 and --UCK-- 1994), but the deeper story is nastier still.<br />This book lifts the rock on the Mets and what is crawling underneath is not pretty. The egos alone are ridiculous, but throw in the infighting, the firecrackers, the rape accusations, the press lockouts, and the non-stop party attitude that looks from here like Animal House without the humor.<br />You've got to feel sorry for Jeff Torborg and Buddy Harrelson, who didn't have a chance with this pack. As you'll see, though, the owner and General Managers also get their due.<br />NOW I want to see the 2002 edition of this book. This book proved to me that there is tons of stuff that go on behind the scenes. What happened in 2002?<br />It's also nice to reminisce about a time when sports writers didn't pull as many punches with their writing. Nobody is spared; the GM, the owners, past managers, players, etc.<br />Not to knock ESPN which is not local enough, or radio commentary like \\"Mike & The Maddog\\" which I believe to be too much a mouthpiece of the team, but this book also stands up as a testament to newspaper coverage which goes into more and better detail than cable can offer. <br />These guys bled Blue and Orange every day from spring training to the end of the year because it was their job. When that blood went bad, they wrote this book. As a Met fan, let me say \\"Thank You\\".  This book takes that coverage to the next power. It is something you do not see enough of. <br />The only real flaw in this book is that it could have been a little better organized. The chronology is a bit vague; background-setting flashbacks show up and go on for pages until you've forgotten what you're getting background on. It is a minor quip, though, and I didn't even notice it until subsequent readings.<br />This book will probably shock you, but you should still pick it up.	2002-10-28

Mick Axbrewder has been having a very tough time of things since he accidentally shot his brother, a cop. He can't find regular work and has taken to bouncing, providing muscle, and alcohol--lots of it. Now, however, his neice is missing and his brother's widow and his ex-partner are expecting Mick to sober up and figure out what is going on in the sunny town of Puerto del Sol.<br />This book works on a couple of levels. It's a hard-boiled Chandleresque mystery (complete with those dark metaphors that sit in a paragraph like a black widow spider on a freshly painted white wall). It's a study in overcoming alcoholism.  And it is a study in contradictions: the darkness in sunny Puerto del Sol, the noble acts of a tortured character.<br />I think the only flaw is that the book is incredibly bleak at times, something that can be said of some of Donaldson's other work.  Mick is painted in many shades of self-loathing, but only rarely reaches the darkest despair. Some readers might find that a bit of a tough, at times wondering how Mick can go on...I don't know if this version will be better than the original or not, and I'll edit this review when I'm able to compare. ...	2002-10-25

This book, a reference to Seasons 11 as 12, goes a long way towards explaining why. <br />This is third in the reference series of Simpsons books (the first is \\"The Simpsons: A Complete Guide To Our Favorite Family\\" and \\"The Simpsons Forever\\"). But forget all of the stodgy things that come with the word \\"reference\\". This is like reading the scripts to the \\"Director's Cut\\" of each episode.  The series is so detailed and layered, joke upon joke, that it takes a reference book like this to give you appreciation of how much work goes into The Simpsons.  This book give you back-character development, all of the tiny little jokes that fly by too fast for you to see (like the sayings on the church billboard), and lots of the freeze frame humor (The Animal Control ad has a woman fending an octopus off with a broom, or store names: \\"Just Chloroform: The Store For Liquid Persuasion\\"). Plus the more obvious list of chalkboard gags \\"I WILL NOT PLANT SUBLIMN al MESSA gore S\\", and couch gags. <br />Of course, it really helps to have seen the episodes. There are some things that were funny when you saw them that aren't funny when you read them. \\"New Kids On The Bleech\\", the episode where Bart forms a boy band, was hysterical when I saw it but didn't seem as funny when I read the premise.<br />If you love the show, the three reference books are indispensable. I found myself laughing at all of the things I missed in episodes I'd already laughed at!	2002-10-24

But that's not The REAL Story.  What REALLY happened is much more interesting.<br />The first (and shortest) book in the Gap series focuses on The Real Story.  Donaldson has a lot of fun twisting expectations and unpeeling layers.  It makes for a good book, but not a great one.  The more important function of The Real Story is to get you ready for The BETTER Story, which is The Gap Cycle.<br />I believe Donaldson is one of the best world-builders out there. If you've read the incredible Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, you'll know what I'm talking about.  This is what he is best at and I believe his writing fades a bit when he writes character studies.  The world of The Gap Cycle is compelling and, in its own way, enchanting but you don't get to see a lot of it in this book.  Donaldson is setting up some concepts (Gap Drive, Forbidden Space, Piracy and why it thrives), but most of this book is a character study of the vile Angus and the newly- orphaned Morn.  There are huge scads of this book that are dialog free; Donaldson is doing a lot of telling, and not much showing.  <br />And some of it is quite brutal.  In his afterword (in my edition of this book) Donaldson admits that he thought for a long time before publishing the story because he didn't like to think about what people might think of him.  While I'm glad he published it, the nastiness does go over the top in places and seems a bit gratuitous.  I believe that following a less-is-more strategy and allowing our own nightmares to fill in the blanks would have been more effective.<br />But who am I to presume to tell SRD to write?  I'm just glad he did.  Stick with this book because the next one is much better.<br />The Gap Series has everything you could want in a Space Opera.

What if you were whisked away to another world?  This is the premise of a thousand fantasy yarns out there, but think about it for a second: Why is it that all those protagonists have little trouble with the transition?  Right now you're sitting in front of your computer reading this, what if when you turned around you were temporarily blinded and began to hear voices?  You'd think that you were crazy, wouldn't you?  <br />Now what if you had some debilating incurable disease--something you'd spent years getting used to having--and when this worldshift happened, you were magically cured?  Well then you'd KNOW you were crazy.  Right?  What would you do?<br />This is the crux of Thomas Covenant.  Thomas, a leper, is having a very a tough time in the real world.  I'm not giving away anything that isn't in the first chapter, but as the book starts his wife has taken their kid and divorced him, nobody wants to have anything to do with him, and he is having to fight with despair at every turn.<br />When crossing the street he faints--or something--and finds himself in THE LAND.  Thomas is quite sure dismay has sent him around the bend, he's gone nuts, and he makes the decision not to believe his own senses.  He is, as the title suggests, The Unbeliever.<br />Our Protagonist is a very dark character indeed.  Admit it, you'd have a similar reaction, wouldn't you?  Since Covenant doesn't believe in The Land, does his actions there have any consequences?  He commits some very dark acts at the beginning of his time in the land, then spends the next thousand or so pages regretting it.  Enough said.<br />What pulls this trilogy off, though, is not Mr. Unbeliever, but The Land and the people in it.  SRD does quite an amazing job of creating a beautiful world full of magic and heroism and its own ancient history.  <br />Donaldson is one of the few fantasy writers fit to be mentioned in the same league as J.R.R. Tolkein, someone who he obviously studied and, I suspect, worked hardnot to imitate.  If that's the case then he succeeded, for The Land and its peoples are as wonderful as Middle-Earth while having almost nothing in common with them.  And this is the central conflict of the book, something that is guaranteed to grab you and hold on to you:  because pretty soon, YOU are rooting for The Land, you care about it more than Covenant does, and you keep waiting for Thomas to come up with a better answer for his unbelief.<br />I don't want to go into detail on story, but SRD is quite aware that you've read Lord of the Rings and he works hard to make this interesting and something you won't expect.   Again, it is dark.  Covenant is at constant war with his unbelief even as those around him fight to protect him and protect The Land.  <br />I guarantee this:  If you can get over the darkness of it (Lord Foul is quite aptly named, and there are plenty of foul deeds in the trilogy), you will read and reread these books with fervor.  I'll never forget the thrill I had reading The Power That Preserves.<br />____________________<BR>The second trilogy doesn't reach the heights of the first, and downright clunks in the middle, but I still recommend it.<br />Reviews for each of the books:<BR>Lord Foul's Bane:  A<BR>The Illearth War:  A+<BR>The Power That Preserves:  A+<BR>The Wounded Land:  A<BR>The One Tree:  C<BR>White Gold Weilder:  A	2002-10-21

It also does a good job of letting you know your responsibilities to Uncle Sam and gives you some good advice on easing that blow.<br />It isn't exhaustive, though.  You'll still need to do a lot of research on the local level.  As Kamaroff points out, some localities are conducive to business and some are intensively regulated.  This is where a lot of your problems are likely to happen.

I've avoided most of them, but this was placed in my hands as a &quot;must read.&quot;  And I'm very glad I read it.<br />When the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center, US Airspace was closed.  Several thousand transatlantic airline passengers found themselves diverted to Canada.  This is a story of some of the 6,000 that found themselves in Gander, Newfoundland.<br />You wouldn't think a story about what is on the surface a 4 day unscheduled layover would be so compelling.  But the response of this tiny town with a large airport (a former airbase) is incredibly moving.<br />Jim DeFede does an incredible job of getting out of the way and letting the story speak for itself.  He interviewed a large sample of the people who were stranded, as well as the people who opened their homes and set up shelters.  A good portion of the books covers the incredible logisticics involved, but it never loses the human element.<br />The generosity of the people of Gander is something to behold.  The stories of astounding generosity come one after another:  The pharmacist who worked 30 hours straight to fill perscriptions from all over the world at no cost to the passengers, the vet who set up a shelter for animals in transit, and the countless people who raided their own linen closets so the passengers would have sheets and towels (none of the passengers had access to their luggage).<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who's lost faith in humanity since 09/11/01.  <br />{Special note to Canada:  Thank you!}	2002-10-11

Your doctor isn't going to help you with your record producer husband, either. <br />If you're looking for funny stories about gas or stretch marks, you can pick it up, (though I didn't find it funny).

This one was the best by far.<br />I can think of at least three reasons this book has sold so many copies.<br />1> It's professional. A lot of books try too hard to be funny or cute. WTE is not humorless, but it deals with subject matter in a refreshingly straightforward way. The advice and help given echoes what our doctors have said and, in fact, answered most of our questions before we even saw our Obstetritian (no, it's not a substitute). It is quite astounding how many pregnancy books are written by fashion magazine editors or talk show writers; they sound exactly like they were written for a fashion magazine or talk show.<br />2> It's complete. Got a question about diet, medication, flu shots, cat ownership, false labor, vitamin supplements, cramps, ultrasound, breastfeeding or how to judge your OB/GYN? It's in here, along with tons of other stuff we didn't think about until we came across it here. <br />Just about every pregnancy book and magazine uses the \\"What Nobody Will Tell You\\" tagline. Once you've read this book, there will be very few surprises left. There isn't a topic that isn't touched on and most are covered in depth. That's not to say this is the only book you need, but it goes a long, long way.<br />3> It isn't judgemental. There are a ton of books out there that are weight obsessed, make assumptions about single parents, and/or skirt some issues that some consider controversal. This book assumes you can make up your own mind once you're presented with all the information. I'm thinking specifically about the decision to have amniocentesis our geneticist said it was \\"a good idea but not necessary\\" and OB/GYN said \\"there were risks but it is not a bad idea\\". This book wasn't a replacement for our doctors, but it gave us a lot of really useful information without taking a side.<br />---<br />Like I said, there are a ton of pregnancy books out there. Just about all of the ones we read were redundant when we held it up next to WTE. And it's pretty shocking how many pregnancy books we found to be completly WORTHLESS! I don't want to name names, and I've already written a couple of negative reviews, but I'm thinking particularly of the ones full of Erma Bombeck-esque anecdotes about La Maz classes, the \\"staying chic while you're pregnant\\" fashion mag type, the old-fashioned preachy church lady books, or--worst of all--the \\"nutrition\\" books that focused almost entirely on weight. Some of these books are written by people with no medical qualifications at all! <br />My advice is to feel free to pick up one of those books if you're looking for some comic relief or if your specific pregnancy may need a supplement (I'm thinking specifically of things like fertility problems, or problem pregnancies; WTE gives a lot of good information on this stuff, but might not be enough).<br />Either way, BUY THIS BOOK!! Even if you're not pregnant yet, you're missing out on an excellent reference if you don't. <br />- - -<br />As an aside, I was pretty shocked to read the reviews that complained about WTE containing a lot of information on rare pregnancy situations, saying that such information was \\"scary\\" and \\"unnecessary\\".  WTE gives plenty of information on what is serious as opposed to what is a false alarm.  Nobody PLANS on having a troubled pregnancy, aren't you better off knowing what's involved and how to detect and prevent such things?  <br />I suppose for some people ignorance is bliss, but I'm MUCH happier being prepared.<br />What To Expect While You're Expecting isn't the only useful pregnancy book out there, but it is the best and it will be the standard for years to come.	2002-09-30

O'Neil is driven mad with grief and unleashes a biochemically engineered plague on the world, one that is 100% fatal to women.<br />While not Herbert's best book, it is still fantastic. Frank paints a horrific picture of governments racing first against each other to be the first to find a cure, and soon realilsing that a cure will only come with cooperation.  Each country deals with the plague differently and the sweep of the story stretches around the world and back to the beginning as O'Neil admires his handiwork. <br />The story is quite action driven for a Herbert book. With most women dying off, the planet soon becomes unrecognizable. Will a cure be found in time? What form will it take? How will humanity survive? Herbert's trademark philosophical ruminations are there, just below the surface for plucking if you're interested. I will say, though, that the irony of thousand-year-old cultures having to re-write themselves overnight in the name of survival wasn't lost on me.<br />Even more tantalizing is the ending which will leave you wondering what will happen next. Not that there's a cliffhanger, but the world is so different you imagine a sequal would have done very well.<br />This is a really good book. It may drag a bit in spots and some of the science involved is a bit dated, but it is still very enjoyable.  There's something wrong when a book as good as this one written by a author as popular as Herbert is out of print. Surely there must be some publishing company out there willing to cash in on the writings of a man whose works have been brought to the screen twice (soon to be three times, with \\"Children of Dune\\").  Anyone?<br />Until that happens, pick up a copy at a used bookstore.  You won't regret it.	2002-09-17

Dune, his most popular book (with 2 film adaptations) is an incredible epic. This book, however, is something that has stuck with me and improved with every reading. It a superior work in a lot of ways.<br />Some spoiler-free background:<br />Like a James Bond in the future, 500-year-old Jorge McKie is an agent for the government. The government in question is the ConSentiency: an amalgam of all sentient races in the galaxy worknig to keep the peace. This alone is an incredibly difficult prospect, for surly a race with a different biology and a different culture would come up with a different set of laws. How could such a thing as a ConSentiency exist? Making things more difficult are two relatively new uphevals: 1> that stars are sentent beings, and 2> stars themselves allow instant travel from place to place in the galaxy.<br />And now, as our story starts, the uneasy peace is threatened by an experiment: 200 years previously, a race of aliens has created Dosadi: a poison planet inhabited with kidnapped humans and aliens who have had their memories erased and been dumped on the planet to fend for themselves. How will they survive when cut off from the rest of the galaxy and not given enough resources? <br />The makers of Dosadi hope to learn how to improve their own race, but their creation becomes something else entirely. It is horror enough that this world exists, but what to do with the experiment? McKie, with the fate of the entire planet in his hands, is ordered to visit the planet and discover for himself.<br />All of this is revealed in the first few chapters, and I won't go into any more plot detail. The beauty of this book, though, is the extremes of the ConSentiency and Dosadi; and the truly alien nature of the aliens. Herbert fills the ConSentiency and Dosadi with many layers of meaning that unpeel before the readers eyes. McKie is a character who has dedicated his life to reaching for the alien shore (his expertise is in alien law and ethics). When McKie travels to Dosadi, he will find how life-altering his vocation can be.<br />I'd also like to add that few authors could write a book that includes a courtroom drama so completly alien and so compelling.<br />This is a wonderful book. Some passages ring so piercingly that you just have to put the book down and absorb them. Dosadi is an unpleasant world, to be sure, but it works as a nice stand-in for our own. And there are a ton of ethical questions abounding in this book, not that Frank is one to hit you over the head with them. For in addition to all of the philosophy and metaphysics, it is a ripping good yarn.  <br />Note: \\"The Dosadi Experiment\\" takes place in the same universe as \\"The Whipping Star\\" and \\"The Artful Saboteaur\\", but it is NOT a sequal and it can be read on its own.<br />Enjoy!	2002-09-16

There's a good reason this book has sold more copies then any other non-fiction book this year: It is also roll on the floor funny.  <br />This book has so much to offer.  It is a scathing look at Republicans and Democrats alike and pulls no punches in talking about how corporations have purchased elections and cooked the courtrooms.  Amazingly, it was written pre-Enron and pre-Worldcom.  <br />Chances are, the people who wrote the negative reviews have no sense of humor whatsoever.  The folks at Harper thought this book went way to far and almost didn't publish it!  That makes sense in a really weird anti-capitalist way, because if you're easily offended, there's probably something in this book that will really annoy you.  If you like \\"politically correct\\" humor, then you should definitely pass.  And if you think either Republicans or Democrats are sacred and shouldn't be mocked, you should move on.  <br />But if you like political commentary with a good dose of humor (a la Chris Rock), this book will give you more than you could ever want.<br />I mean, it is now in it's 30th printing and spent over 6 months on the NYT Bestseller list!  Read it and find out why.	2002-09-12

It's in there...somewhere...	My wife and I came to this book for advice on our first pregnancy and had to work hard to get to the useful stuff.<br />Let's start with the chapter on \\"Nutrition During the First Trimester\\" (which is where we were when we bought the book).  There's a section called \\"Optimal Weight Gain\\" where the author talks a lot about gaining too much weight and not gaining enough, but little on what is just right.  There's plenty of Cosmo-esque \\"advice\\" (\\"You are eating for two, but that second person is a baby not a linebacker\\", \\"If you want that prepregnancy little black dress to fit after pregnancy...\\") before you get to anything useful (\\"Aim for a 25 to 35 pound gain, but don't worry if you're short or over this mark as long as you are monitored by a physician.\\").<br />The author advises pregnant women to not obsess over their weight.  This advice would have been helpful for the author, who open each pregnancy chapter with a long section on weight gain.  These sections contain a lot of harping on \\"don't gain too much!\\" and \\"don't gain too little!\\" without the corresponding \\"just right\\" information.<br />Ironically, the author clucks her tongue at pre-liberation women who would obsess about gaining too much weight.  I wonder if the author realizes how much she perpetuates such obsessions with her \\"little black dress\\" references.  As you read the book, you get the impression that she's a little obsessed herself and you find yourself wanting to comfort the author that you fully understand the perils of too-much-or-not-enough weight gain, and could we please change the subject?<br />Also annoying is Somer's tendancy to talk down to her readers.  Lots of advice is doled out with a \\"Do this\\" or \\"Don't do that\\" attitude, sometimes falling annoyingly short on the reasons why.<br />That's not to say the book isn't useful.  Once you get beyond the unnecessarily stylized content, you'll get a good education on supplements, what foods to avoid, and foods that are especially helpful during pregnancy (or \\"SUPER FOODS!!!\\").<br />But the overall tone of the book is more fashion magazine than professional (especially compared to the far superior \\"What to Expect When Expecting\\" books).  It is pretty telling that the \\"about the author\\" credits list \\"The Today Show\\", \\"Good Morning America\\" and \\"Shape\\" magazine first.  It reads like something stylistically packaged that occasionally contains useful information.pful during pregnancy (or \\"SUPER FOODS!!!\\").  <br />But the overall tone of the book is more fashion magazine than professional (especially compared to the far superior \\"What to Expect When Expecting\\" books).

US	43586748	R2XJL32TJQGPTZ	0871133156	955619277	Nightshade	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Poet Journeys To Mars	Jack Butler is probably most known for his contempory fiction and (perhaps to a lesser extent) his poetry. This is his first foray into Science Fiction (his later novel \\"Dreamer\\" may qualify if the definition is stretched a bit). While the transition could have been a little more graceful, the results are compelling.<br />For starters, Butler paints the same kind of landscapes that Robert Heinlein does. You won't find a lot of exposition, the action comes at you fast, and the reader has to do some work keeping abreast of the slang of 22nd Century Mars. There's also a slight political undertone. Never pedantic, Our Author prefers to show situations that have resulted from the extremes of human nature and technology.<br />Hellas is a Martian frontier town, a community living in one of Mars' 30 mile wide craters. The atmosphere being thin, an enormous tent keeps the air pressure at habitable levels. Within this settlement live the kind of folk one expects to see in any Martian Colony of the future: genetically engineered beasts, ranchers, enhanced people, and intelligent robots.<br />The story (and I don't like giving stuff away), deals mostly with a war for independance from Earth. But focus is kept on our hero--a rancher turned leader of the cecessionists--who is about 400 years old.<br />The book gets off to a bit of a slow start. Somewhere about a quarter of the way through--somewhere about the time you've figured out how this world works--the story sinks it's talons into you and takes you away. You're helpless. <br />Nightshade is not without it's flaws, but I really enjoyed this book and would love to see it come back into print. In the meantime, see if you can find a copy somewhere.	2002-03-11

Containing not just recipies, but info on how to buy an avacodo, the difference between a pinch and a dash, seventy five different things you can do with garlic, etc. For me, these books are useful, but they take all of the fun out of cooking. Worse, they don't encourage experimentation<br />2&gt; The regional or course-specific kind.  You know, books just about chocolate or cajun or brunch.  Again, nice to have (especially if you're marrying someone Italian and you happen to be Jamacian... or something like that), but a little too specific for every day use.<br />3&gt; The book that tries to do a good bit of the above, but focuses more on stoking your enthusiasm, your experimentation, and your built in love of food (you know you have one).<br />Jack's Skillet is fixed squarely in category number three.  This slim book offers 50-odd chapters on every course or occasion or meal that you might come across in a year.  Family get-togethers, Easter dinners, oysters, miles of chicken dishes, homemade pizza, shortcake, salads, barbeque, soups, blackberry pies, coffee, margaritas, biscuits, camping, meat loaf, cake and even home made crackers (&quot;more convenient than going to the store&quot;).  <br />Each chapter reads like an ode to the food and the situation it's being prepared in.  The &quot;flavor text&quot; is entertainment in and of itself.  When the time comes for the recipies at then end of each chapter, you're already drooling.  <br />The recipies themselves are straightforward.  Jack takes you through them in prose, then again in regular recipe form.  The recipies avoid the banal of the over-simple and complex ornate-ness of the caterer.  This is home cooking. <br />While there's a fair amount of regional pride from Jack (who's lived in Mississippi, Arkansas and New Mexico), Jack makes a strong effort to avoid limiting his scope and pulls recipies from all over.<br/>Experimentation is encouraged and the reader is given a nice framework to experiment in.  <br />In short, this is a book that encourages cooking.  It gives the reader the enthusiasm that one only gets from a well-written cookbook; not just a book with good recipies.  Pick it up!	2002-01-02

Rendezvous With Rama was a gem.  Maybe a little short on character development, but with such a wonderful world to explore, who cares?  Around every corner of the exploration were wonders... flights over a cylindrical sea, biots, mile-long stairways...  Wasn't it great?  Didn't you feel like you were reading the journals of explorers who themselves felt like ants in a cathedral?   Didn't the whole book just blow your mind?<br />Well you won't find any of those virtues in this book or any of the sequale that follow.<br />Want to make Rama a boring place?  All you have to do is fill it with insipid caricatures; each one of them straight from a 20th century soap opera.  Remember that heroic group from the first book that pulled together in the face of catastrophe?  They're gone.  Rama II and it's sequals leave us with short-sighted bureaucrats, beautiful-but-power-mad women (Italian of course), impossibly altruistic scientists, amoral lawyers, corporate types (American of course) who want to use Raman technology to create new weapons, cowboy presidents, the pope, gangsters (African-American of course), chess-playing Russians, oversexed teens, murderously jealous lovers, and a computer geek who overcomes his social ineptness to save the day and win the girl (guess what! Gentry Lee is a computer guy).  <br />Maybe Clarke and Lee were worried that Commander Norton and his crew were all cut from the same &quot;noble scientist&quot; cloth that many of Clarke's characters use.  If so, they overcompensated drastically.  A spear-toting Eskimo or a peg-legged pirate wouldn't seem out of place in this group, but an intelligently written character would.<br />Most of the gaggle of Knots Landing rejects don't care at all about Rama II (the second spaceship that shows up 70 years after the first one) and since the book focuses on their bickering, their pregnancies, and their murders, neither will you.  <br />After this one the books actually get worse. And by the time the Ramans reveal themself you (and conincidentally enough, many of the characters) are completly indifferent.<br />If you've read &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot; and haven't read this book yet, then don't.  You'll be sorry you did.	2001-11-20
US	43586748	R3UE48QYPA6BW3	0345438205	284653366	3001 The Final Odyssey	Books	2	5	7	N	N	Not with a bang but a whimper	Midway through Childhood's End (one of Clarke's best books), there is a chapter that summarises the change of human culture from present state (cold war, dark ages) to utopia (peace, atheism).  It's a quick transitional chapter (maybe 10 pages in the middle of the book) that serves to make a millenial leap in the narrative and gets the reader ready for the next part of the story--the really good part. <br />If you took that one chapter, fleshed it out so it's about 200 pages and slapped a monolith on the book cover, you'd have 3001: The Final Odyssey. Unfortunately, while Childhood's End had a powerful evocative story to get on with, there's almost no story here and certainly no really good part.<br />Taken on it's own, 3001 is an interesting little fiction of what life might be like in the next millennium. The first half of the book takes a visitor from the year 2001 (Frank Poole, from the first book &amp; movie) on a tour through life of the thirtieth century. Here Arthur does a good job of fulfilling his role in writing razzle-dazzle engineering fiction. The descriptions of life in the future are breathtaking. <br />Taking a change from a lot of his work, though, Clarke is not happy with just writing compelling spacescapes. He spends a lot of time criticizing the 20th century: putting our current prison system, using female genital mutation as an example of life during our dark ages.  Clarke takes a lot of swings at what he sees as the root of almost all of our problems--organised religion--and offers us the religion of Science. Science, the way Clarke describes it, is practised devoutly in the thirtieth century and has solved all of the problems that religion has caused.  Frank Poole, being an astronaut and a Clarkian Protagonist, puts up no defense for the near-barbaric times he was born in and comes to believe that life in 2001 is as squalid and barbaric as those from 3001 think it is. If this is your kind of thing, go to it and good luck!<br />As the final chapter in the &quot;Odyssey Quartet&quot;, however, this book leaves so much to be desired. Being spoiler free, I'll say that there are two pervasive problems: massive inconsistencies with earlier books (both in size and frequency), and lack of scope.<br />While Clarke felt a need to update the science from 1965, many of the inconsistencies (especially the ones dealing with HAL, Dave Bowman, and the beings responsible for monoliths) are unnecessary. Worse, they rob the book of much of the charm, solemnity, and wonder that earlier installations had. Many of the inconsistencies are done to simplify what little story there is and accentuate the preaching described above.  A catalog of all the gaffes (most of which Clarke himself acknowledges) would be very long and lend itself to spoilers. Suffice it to say that science that worked in 2001 doesn't work in 3001, characters that made a great impact in 2061 never happened in 3001, events that happened one way in the first three books happened a completly different way within the context of this book.<br />As for scope, the book was a half-day's read. Unlike the 4 million-year journey of the first book, or the interplanetary exploration in the first two, all of the conflict/action takes place in the last 20 pages and there is never any doubt of what will happen.  <br />The book has all the drama and conflict of a travel brocheure.  Which is pretty accurate because at this point it seems like Clarke would rather espouse the virtues of Science then tell a good story.  In case you missed things, though, Arthur adds 15 pages of notations for you; most of which focus on what he predicted accurately, and what he thinks should be our focus as a race.  When you're done, all questions are answered and everything is explained for the reader (who, one imagines, is expected to write to their congresspeople demanding that sceintists get the grants they need to bring 3001 about). <br />Clarke's best works (City and the Stars, 2001, 2010,Rendezvous With Rama, Childhood's End) tell great stories and leave the preaching (such as it is) to marginalia. 3001 has replaced wonder with the dogma of scientific reason; the story is tossed in almost as an afterthought.	2001-11-19
