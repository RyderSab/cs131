He has the ability to transport the reader into the minds, thoughts and souls of fully realized characters who share a specific, defining event in their lives that changes them unalterably.  In his best works, such as \\"Atonement,\\" \\"Amsterdam,\\" and \\"Saturday,\\" McEwan deftly probes the repercussions of this defining moment with prose that is incomparable in its fidelity, precision and pace.  \\"Enduring Love\\" is another remarkable study of the defining moment in three characters' lives and how they come to terms with guilt, obsession and love.  The novel succeeds until the story of Jed's psychopathic obsession for Joe relentlessly repeats itself.  Then the novel collapses, and this is why, despite its other attributes, I cannot give it 5 stars.  When Jed and Joe finally collide in what should be the climax of the novel, this reader is no longer engaged. As a result, I could not fully and willingly suspend my disbelief.  Nevertheless, I continue to marvel at McEwan's genius, even in this somewhat flawed novel.	2005-08-21

I understand the comments of those reviewers who believe that Atwood's strength is the novel, and not the short story, since she excels in the psychological interplay of characters, which usually requires more time to develop than a short story will allow.  However, the stories in \\"Wilderness Tips\\" are all fully realized and memorable, and when one compares them to the stories in \\"Dancing Girls,\\" one immediately realizes how far she has come.  Her writing here is darkly comic, witty, profound, and remarkable.  She captures in each story that fleeting moment in time when someone's life has changed unalterably.	2005-08-20

This compilation of early short stories reveals an author testing the literary waters, without plunging in head first.  We see early glimpses of Atwood's dark wit and terse descriptions.  And we are also treated to many varied and memorable characters, stories and settings.  For those of you who believe, as I do, that Atwood is one of the most accomplished authors writing today, these stories, even though not perfect and early in her career, are far more rewarding than most works by mature authors.  A must read.	2005-08-20

Morgan's writing is simple, yet lyrical, like the writing of Kent Haruf.  However, as Julie's misfortunes continued to occur relentlessly, I began to lose interest because the story became tedious and plodding.  Don't get me wrong; I don't expect happy endings or desire novels written in the manner of Nicholas Sparks.  In fact, some of my favorite authors are Conrad and Dostoevsky, whose visions of life are dark and brooding.  But the novel's change of events and more importantly, the change in Hank and in Julie, the remarkable protagonist who eventually comes to know herself, her husband and her life, come too late.  They are almost afterthoughts, and so this reader is left with the belief that the novel is simply a series of unfortunate events.  Morgan is a great storyteller; his simple, measured prose is remarkably real coming from the simple, uneducated, yet sympathetic Julie.  However, my overall impression of this work is that it read like a Calvinist sermon: that salvation requires excruciatingly hard work, and at best, a very grim and bleak existence.	2005-08-05

If you desire to read about 20 forgettable people in a seriously inbred family speaking at the same time about the impending wedding of one of their own, then this novel is for you.  The only explanation for this work is that it came very early in Welty's career.  I realize that others have defended this novel as revealing quintessential Southern dialogue and acute psychological tension in the characters.  While the dialogue is clearly of the South, it is senseless, repetitive and tedious, and the characters dash madly in and out of the novel, without making any lasting impression on this reader. Instead, read Welty's short stories and \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" and you will discover a totally different Welty:  one whose fully realized characters and profound psychological insights will leave you with the enduring belief in her genius.	2005-08-03

I agree that there are challenges here:  a plodding story, a rich subtext, a foggy past as seen through the eyes of the grieving daughter, Laurel, the foil to Fay, the one-dimensional, fatuous mother-in-law, and a work that requires immense concentration by the reader as the author slowly reveals the haunting mysteries of a family's past.  In reading Welty's short stories, I was struck by how many of them succeed solely because of the psychological tension between the characters.  \\"The Optimist's Daughter\\" is no different; it is a psychological drama that plays out in Laurel's mind as she attempts to explain and understand the complex mysteries of her parents and her past.  In the end, Laurel seems to make peace with herself and her parents, but we are certain that she never fully understands the riddles of her or their history.  I believe that this is precisely what Welty intended:  that are no simple or certain explanations in life, only the inexplicable presence of memory and history.	2005-08-01

Coetzee's writing is spare, riveting and descriptive, but I can't say that it is the best Booker prize novel that I have read.  \\"Amsterdam\\" and \\"The Blind Assassin\\" had a much more profound and lasting effect on me.  That said, this novel is a fine effort nonetheless.	2005-07-25

Only when she is middle-aged does she realize that there is no one to care about her.  There are no jarring twists of plot or dazzling characters in Anne Tyler's novels.  Rather, there are the simple, yet profound observations of family life and the unravelling of life's mysteries.  Tyler graces us with the gift of the expected in unexpected ways.	2005-07-24

Ms. Hazzard's writing has been criticized because \\"nothing happens,\\" a criticism I have heard about James, Austen and other eminent authors, who, like Hazzard, are not accepted by the \\"special effects\\" generation, but who find immense satisfaction and movement in the psychological interplay of characters.  If you are interested in a good plot-driven novel, read \\"Life of Pi.\\"  If, on the other hand, you seek a novel that is rarely written anymore in this post-modern era, where elegance, civility, compassion and hope predominate, then I highly recommend \\"The Great Fire.\\"	2005-07-20

I had no expectations, other than the quotations on the cover, since I had never heard of this author.  My wife indicated that she had enjoyed her novel \\"Sister of My Heart,\\" but warned me that I might be put off because Ms. Divakaruni is considered a \\"chick\\" writer.  While each of these stories is written from the perspective of an Indian woman who must confront an unsettling and disturbing Western culture, I did not feel as if the author shortchanged the male characters.  Rather, I concluded that all of the characters were fully realized and artfully drawn, and the stories themselves were first rate and equal to Lahiri's \\"Interpreter of Maladies.\\"  They deal with themes of assimilation and familial relationships, and they are rescued from the mundane by the author's compassion, humor and marvellous insights.

What interested me as I skimmed the book was the location of the novel in the South.  Ms. Gibbons writes like McCullers, Welty and O'Connor, not in their unrelenting manner of the Southern grotesque (although there are some gruesome tales of people suffering from all kinds of afflictions), but in their portrayal of vivid, memorable characters.  The core of this novel is a three-generation family of intelligent, strong women, and the most remarkable character is the grandmother, a de facto doctor, without a license.  She is the healer of the town, but more importantly, she heals her family and gives them the strength to perservere.  She gives her daughter and her granddaughter the resolve to leave their cloistered home and venture into life self-assured.  Ms. Gibbons' writing is simple, profound and compassionate.  My only criticism of this work is that at times I felt that it was a bit simplistic and contrived, but I recommend it nonetheless.	2005-07-17

It is clearly Gopnik's intent that these essays read like a novel, with certain developed themes and characters, especially the maturation of Gopnik's son.  Gopnik goes as far as to use a print that he acquires (entitled \\"Paris to the Moon\\") as a metaphor of what is lovely, but yet unattainable in his vision of Paris and the French.  I had mixed feelings about this book.  On the one hand, I thoroughly enjoyed his observations about how Americans and Parisians view each other about important cultural issues, and I also enjoyed his attempt to explain the inexplicable lure of Paris that has existed for centuries.  On the other hand, Gopnik was offputting much of the time because it's as if his clever insights were so delightful to him that this book was simply a pretext for his self-reverential musings. I like to determine for myself whether an author is clever, wry or witty; I object, however, when an author writes to validate his self-importance.	2005-07-17

Apart from Mellers' rather professorial, pedantic book and Riley's excellent, approachable book, there is a dearth of material on the music of the Beatles, apart from their sociological or gender ramifications, their cultural iconic status and their effect on fashion and morals, etc.  And the music is the only aspect of the Beatles that should matter, since they were incredible musicians and their music has clearly withstood the test of time.  Forget other recent books about the Beatles, such as \\"Meet the Beatles,\\" which reassesses their sociological and gender significance largely by repeating what was previously written about them.  Everett succeeds brilliantly in reviewing the Beatles' music as if he were reviewing the music of any great composer.  For those who do not have a background in music theory, certain parts of this book may be difficult to comprehend.  However, it is worth the effort.  A fine achievement.	2005-07-14

There are so many books about the Beatles' cultural iconic significance, their sociological and gender influence and a whole host of other irrelevant topics.  What matters most is that the Beatles were timeless musicians who defined the music of the 20th century.  Everett reviews their music as he would any great composer.  If his perspective is too technical and professorial, you may want to consider Riley's \\"Tell Me Why,\\" which is still my favorite book about the Beatles' music.  It provides succinct and probing insights into their music. Everett's book is nevertheless excellent, and I highly recommend it.	2005-07-14

The main characters, the dictator who plunges his country into war, and his Irish wife, a sort of Marie Antoinette figure, who longs for adventure so long as it comes with the trappings of Parisian society, are implausible, wooden and superficially realized.  This could have been a great novel of historical fiction, like \\"Year of Wonders,\\" but the author is content to give us a bloody Fodor travelogue.  In sum, this novel is easy to dismiss, and unfortunately for Ms. Tuck, the news from Paraguay is very bad indeed.	2005-07-11

And dissolved, literally, in a gale of hilarious fart sounds.\\"  And on page 282, Alfred's mistress is sleep:  \\"Sleep was the ideally work-compatible girl he ought to have marrried in the first place.\\"  Don't misunderstand me; I'm not a prude. Rather, I recognize poor writing and inept metaphors, and they appear page after page in this novel.  \\"The Corrections\\" is about the approachable and expectant subject of family relationships, but the novel disengages the reader and lurches along without the author offering any perceptive or lucid insights into these relationships.  This novel is not clever, wickedly funny or dazzling, as certain reviewers have opined.  Instead, it is tedious, boring and insipid.

Other reviewers have discerned class distinctions, historical imperatives and the very essence of life's truths.  All of these observations are apt and insightful.  To me, \\"The Blind Assassin\\" is the rare novel that transports the reader into a wholly fictive world, mesmerizing, mythic and real.  For those who have criticized this novel as being tedious and difficult, I believe that is precisely what Atwood had in mind.  A simple, linear work of fiction could not have carried this weighty, yet lyrical, allegory of guilt, betrayal, denial, revelation, redemption and love.

There is Wilfred Mellers' book \\"Twilight of the Gods,\\" but that is written from the perspective of a professor of classical music, and the results are amusing if not unintelligible.

I was not disappointed.  Ha Jin is a modern-day Hemingway, whose spare, measured prose is set in Communist China which is in the throes of political turmoil as it purges itself of the politically unacceptable, and the politically unacceptable change arbitrarily according to the whims of those in power.  Ha Jin cleverly uses the crazed (but sometimes remarkably astute) outbursts of a sick professor to his student as the basis for this marvelous tale of the individual in an oppressive society.  Ha Jin seems to assert that literature may have a redemptive and meaningful purpose for the individual who must conform to totalitarian rule, but Ha Jin also seems to assert that literature alone cannot save the self; that in the end, the self must oppose the monolith, even if it means obliteration.  The only reason I did not give this novel five stars is that I found the student's fumbling interpretations of the professor's outbursts detracted from my own attempt to divine meaning and purpose from the novel.  However, this is my only reservation; otherwise it is an accomplished and very satisfying work.	2005-06-28

I have read, ad nauseam, reviews of \\"Saturday\\" stressing with strident self-purpose that McEwan has failed us all because this novel is just not as good as \\"Atonement\\" or \\"Amsterdam.\\"  I agree, but are we then supposed to dismiss this work summarily?  I, for one, believe that this novel is a superb story of the fragility of human relationships, whether in the family or in the world.  \\"Saturday\\" speaks clearly and profoundly about life's delicate balance between civility and chaos and how we can never be certain when our own lives will be plunged into chaos.  My only criticism of the novel is that it became tedious at times, especially when McEwan uses complicated medical terms with which I am unfamiliar.  But his choice of a surgeon telling this story is brilliant because a surgeon's precise view of life unravelling before him is all the more effective to advance McEwan's message.  A remarkable novel.	2005-06-28

However, at times, as in \\"Accordion Crimes,\\" she goes over the edge and overwhelms the reader with gratuitous gore, and in so doing, alienates her audience.  \\"That Old Ace in the Hole\\" falls more into this latter category.  It is unengaging and dissatisfying.  Read \\"The Shipping News;\\" it is Proulx at her best.	2005-06-28

I decided to read these excellent stories after a critic compared her to Flannery O'Connor.  Knowing O'Connor's works very well, I thought it an odd comparison at the time, because they wrote in different periods, countries and styles.  But after having read these stories, I think I understand this astute insight into their unique talents: both writers mastered the art of the short story through mystery and manners and spoke to universal truths.	2005-06-28

Although there were times when I wanted to abandon reading this novel, I decided to perservere, and in the end I was amply rewarded.  I'm going to advise you up front that this is an arduous novel; it is at times in the first, second and third persons, it is in the present, the past and the future, it is filled with folklore that is difficult to comprehend, and there are times when the reader is utterly baffled by what is transpiring.  However, I will also tell you that I don't recall ever being drawn so completely into a fictive world, so different from reality and yet so powerfully real.  This novel inspires wonder and awe, and I am grateful to the author for his genius.	2005-06-28

The irony of the story is that when he is finally able to divorce his wife, his mistress is very sick and she has changed, so that he no longer loves her, and after having divorced his wife, he finds himself seeking her love and forgiveness.  At the end of the novel, Lin Kong's relationship with both women is intentionally ambiguous and at best doubtful.  Lin Kong is therefore waiting for something that will never occur, and in that sense, he is the existential protagonist with no exit.  While Ha Jin succeeds in portraying the agony of waiting, he fails to make Lin Kong a sympathetic character.  Lin Kong seems more like a selfish, immature child, rather than a compassionate character who is immobilizied by forces beyond his control.  Stylistically, Ha Jin seems more proficient in writing short fiction.  While \\"In the Pond\\" is satisfying and complete, \\"Waiting\\" is dreary and monotonous.  Look for \\"In the Pond\\" and Ha Jin's short stories.	2005-06-13

However, in \\"Accordion Crimes,\\" Proulx violates her readers' trust with implausible stories of gratuitous gore.  The pretext for her lurid vignettes is a green accordion that passes to various immigrant families, whose members are dismembered in gruesome detail.  While these stories may entertain a few execrable sociopaths, Proulx risks the alienation of her enthusiasts. One can only hope that this work is the aberrant creation of an otherwise unique and remarkable talent.	2005-06-10

I felt that I was reading lines of poetry, as unadorned and profound as an ode by Lao-Tzu.  Jin writes of an artist's confrontation with the oppressive Communist system, but Jin's story is more about the individual asserting the power of the self against the monolith and the artist against the philistines.

McDermott's novel is entertaining and at times insightful, but it is rarely profound.  I found myself skipping pages of text because I was not engaged in the plot or the characters' lives, and in the end, the story seemed to me like one-dimensional musings of life and life's unfulfilled dreams.  \\"Charming Billy\\" is like a mediocre \\"Big Chill,\\" and one wonders how it merited the National Book Award for fiction.  While McDermott's writing is polished and mature, she fails to transcend the reminiscences of her characters to afford the reader perceptive or discerning truths about life.  In the end, the novel failed to involve me and was quickly forgetten.  It was, in a word, charming.	2005-06-01

Anne Tyler has a gift for portraying ordinary indivdiuals who live ordinary lives.  Yet her novel is anything but ordinary because her characters are simple, yet real and their dialogue rings true.  Moreover, Ms. Tyler, like Hardy and Miller before her, clearly believes and successfully posits that her mundane characters are heroic because they survive, perservere and present (albeit unknowingly) moral and spiritual lessons that are universal to us all. But my hesitation in giving this novel 5 stars is that, while it is great fiction, it is not the greatest fiction of its time. And this raises another issue.  Why have so many Pulitzer Prize novels, such as \\"Gilead,\\" \\"The Known World,\\" \\"Empire Falls,\\" \\"The Hours,\\" \\"Kavalier & Clay,\\" and \\"Middlesex,\\" disappointed me recently? While these are compelling and at times superb works, they are not, in my opinion, deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.  Of recent winners, only \\"The Shipping News\\" merits that distinction.  Perhaps I will focus on National Book Award winners, since they seem more uniformly satisfying.	2005-05-31

Drawing on \\"1984,\\" \\"Brave New World,\\" and \\"Farenheit 451,\\" Atwood creates her own terrifying future, one in which the religious right has taken over America and subjugated its people to unrelenting fear and torture.  Atwood illustrates how easy it is to take rational religious beliefs and stretch them beyond recognition until they become specious and repellent, so that the miracle of birth becomes mechanized propagation.  Atwood succeeds masterfully in her premise because she turns story into parable:  That when human freedom is denied, whether by theocracy, fascism, or any form of totalitarianism, life's only choice is rebellion, because acceptance, or even acquiescence, is a living death.	2005-05-18

Until recently, Bechtle, who paints street scenes and rows of tract houses, was known only to Bay Area collectors and critics.  Now, because of this exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art which then travels to the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Bechtle is receiving deserving national exposure.  Bechtle, like the rest of the photo realists, such as Richard Estes, Chuck Close and Ralph Goings, believes that by painting exactly what a photograph reveals, he is painting the truest and most accurate form of realism, because he is removing the artist and the artist's emotions and feelings from his paintings.  But what this book so aptly suggests is that even photographers, who use the camera to capture a scene, infuse the subject with their identity:  the photographer chooses the subject, crops the photograph in a certain manner, decides whether the photograph will be in color or black and white, and how the subject will be juxtaposed with other images.  This is exactly what Bechtle does in his paintings.  One can't help but think that his choice of lower middle class suburban streets and houses is a comment on the banality of existence and American consumerism.  Bishop does a first-rate job in this book, selecting paintings from Bechtle's entire career, which spans four decades.  Moreover, Bishop includes excellent commentaries from critics with different and interesting perspectives.  A fine effort.<br /><br />For those of you who missed the Bechtle retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art or the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, you should be aware that The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. has announced that it will be the final venue for the retrospective from March 4 to June 4, 2006.	2005-05-18

In this book of essays/musings as diverse as the erroneous interpretation of \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" by Cliff Notes or Tan's debilitating and horrifying bout with Lyme disease, the author writes with zest, humor and insight, and she engages the reader from the first page.  In some ways, writing essays about one's craft is more difficult than writing a novel because essays are generally less creative and inspiring than fiction, and the reader usually suffers as a result.  But Tan's \\"The Opposite of Fate: A Book of Musings\\" is like O'Connor's \\"Mystery and Manners\\" and \\"The Habit of Being\\" in that both authors are able to inform their essays with clever and profound insights that are contained in their works of fiction.

So much for the mantra that good fiction is dead!  Alan Brown's first novel, \\"Audrey Hepburn's Neck,\\" is a witty, clever, satirical and humorous story of a Japanese man whose childhood fantasy is Audrey Hepburn, and who, as an adult, seeks out American women to satisfy this fantasy, albeit with amusing consequences.  Most of the novel is devoted to Toshi's awkward and unfulfilling relationships with women he cannot comprehend and the advice he solicits from his best friend, Paul, a gay American man, who is only interested in Japanese men.  Neither man can help the other in understanding love's mysteries and entanglements, and they stumble and flail in the novel like two U.N. diplomats who have the wrong translation.  The novel's obvious theme is the clash of Japanese and Western cultures, but it is Brown's writing and style that save \\"Audrey Hepburn's Neck\\" from becoming inane or fatuous.  Alan Brown is no Faulkner, but he is a modern-day Noel Coward, and Brown's work succeeds in that style.  This is an entertaining and refreshing novel, all the more remarkable since it is Brown's first.	2005-05-17

Berg is clearly the doting author, and he writes about Hepburn's extraordinary intellect, talent and life with compassion and adoration.  Berg is honest that this book is not a biography because he lacks objectivity about Hepburn, which of course, is the most important prerequisite of a biographer.  However, I have to agree with those reviewers who question his motives.  Indeed, I find it ironic that he so unamiguously impugns Michael Jackson and Warren Beatty for their desire to use Hepburn for their own selfish ends, yet he spares himself this judgment.  At the end of this book, one feels that Hepburn is forced into the wings, while Berg takes center stage.	2005-05-16

Thiebaud is best known for his hyper-realistic paintings of food, so luscious and sensual that they have universal appeal.  When Theibaud first started painting in this style, he was compared to the Pop Artists, such as Warhol, Wesselmann, Indiana and Ramos.  However, Thiebaud always tried to set himself apart from these artists, because although he agreed with their use of repetitive images as a comment on the banality of American consumerism, he wanted to paint well and believed that a series of soup cans painted poorly did not reflect his goal as an artist.  It took many years after the Pop Artists became famous for Thiebaud to achieve the recognition that he deserved, partly because he was considered a regional artist who painted in California.  This book is the seminal treatise on the works of Thiebaud and is therefore a must read.	2005-05-13

The reader is immediately engaged, and the fact that half of the novel is devoted to one day in the lives of these characters is all the more remarkable because the writing is so effortless and profound and is never tedious or plodding.  \\"Atonement\\" is simply fiction at its best; it rarely gets any better than this.  Some reviewers have complained that the ending is abrupt and disappointing.  I disagree.  The ending is remarkable for its revelation that redemption and atonement sometimes take years to grace our lives, and then again, sometimes elude us even at death.  \\"Atonement\\" is a masterpiece of fiction, and it is one of the most satisfying novels that I have read in the last several years.	2005-05-13

What a waste of money!  The author uses the pretext of a book club formed to discuss Jane Austen's novels to probe the lives of its participants.  However, unlike \\"Reading Lolita In Tehran,\\" which uses a similar format of a group of students studying Western literature against the fascinating backdrop of a violent and brutal totalitarian Iran, this novel does not succeed at any level.  It neither gives us insights into the remarkable works of Jane Austen, nor does it give us insights into the dull lives of the book club's characters.  Ms. Fowler's writing is vapid, superficial and unengaging.  I felt that I was reading a series of \\"one liners\\" gone terribly wrong in a struggling lounge or comedy club with the ubiquitous drumroll and cymbal after each line.  How many readers were able to endure the repeated \\"bulls-eyes\\" or \\"as ifs\\"?  For me, the only redeeming part of this novel was at the end, when I read the opinions of famous writers and critics of Austen's fiction.  As one reviewer so aptly said, read the novels themselves; they are timeless. This novel, on the other hand, is drivel and is not worth purchasing, even at a garage sale.	2005-05-09

One was that it is was somewhat of a sequel to \\"Plainsong,\\" in that it reintroduces certain characters, such as the McPheron brothers and Victoria Roubideaux.  The other more important reason is that I was so impressed with Mr. Haruf's spare, simple and measured, yet compassionate prose in \\"Plainsong\\" that I wanted to read more of his fiction.  \\"Eventide\\" has all of the elements of \\"Plainsong\\":  a rugged, brutal rural landscape, characters who are barely hanging on to sanity in their lives, and of course, Haruf's extraordinary talent of infusing his characters with grace and compassion, which is so absent in modern fiction.  My only criticism of \\"Eventide\\" is that the conclusion seems somewhat abrupt and inconclusive as to certain characters, and too tidy and implausible as to other characters.  However, having said this, I still strongly recommend this novel; Haruf is a gift to all readers of good fiction.	2005-05-07

I had exactly the same experience.  \\"The Namesake\\" is about an immigrant family from India and their struggles to adapt in America, but more importantly, the novel speaks to relationships and rituals of family, country and love in a manner that is so simple, yet so elegant, controlled and profound.  Ms. Lahiri has her detractors who say that nothing happens in this novel; I am reminded of critics of Austen who have said the same thing.  However, this novel tells a very believable story that is animated by the author's ability to captivate the reader with unadorned prose that is never false or tentative.  I am truly amazed that this is only her second work of fiction.  Think of Hemingway or Kent Haruf.	2005-05-06

It is about the healing and redemptive power of fiction that enables one to cope with life, however mundane or horrifying.  The author holds a secret class at her home, teaching Western literature to a group of students, cloistered, as if in a mosque, while modern-day Iran is plunged into violence, brutality, censorship and chaos.  The group's discussions reveal the stark and desperate lives of its members, and that is where the novel excels.  But too often, the author lapses into simplistic and self-reverential analyses of the novels that she teaches; it's as if she uses this novel to seek the readers' approval of her literary criticism.  In the end, this remarkable story of Iran and the lives of certain of her people are overwhelmed by the author's solipsistic musings.	2005-05-05

The author is a remarkable and self-assured talent, deftly weaving a multitude of plots and creating characters who are vivid and memorable.  The center of this known world is a black slave-holding family, but the novel is more about the fragile hierarchy of blacks and whites, free and enslaved, poor and wealthy in antebellum Virgina, and ultimately the very violent collapse of this hierarchy, as if it is a harbinger of the Civil War.  I highly recommend this novel, but I have to agree with others who have reservations about its receiving a Pulitzer Prize.  I just do not think this novel was that good; there were times that the plots began to blur, the characters seemed faceless and the novel became tedious.  However, my reservations are minor when compared to the novel's overall beauty and spiritual purpose.  It is definitely worth the time and effort to read.	2005-05-02

Annie Proulx astonished us with her remakable and refreshingly original novel, \\"The Shipping News,\\" and while she has stated that she is not as proficient in writing short stories as in writing novels, I disagree.  I could not put down these stories of the brutal and grotesque rural landscape, and none of the stories disappoints.  I look forward to reading her other collections, \\"Close Range: Wyoming Stories\\" and \\"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2.\\"  Ms. Proulx is fast becoming one of America's leading authors of fiction.	2005-04-29

Marilynne Robinson also takes on the daunting task of a spiritual message in her remarkable novel \\"Gilead,\\" but she does it through the measured and compassionate words of a dying preacher, who is ostensibly writing a diary for his son, but who is in reality writing to himself, to account for his life and to heal life's wounds. For the most part Ms. Robinson succeeds in transcending the religious musings of this preacher, John Ames, with an unerring narrative of love of family, friends and God coupled with the hope of reconciliation and redemption.  The only reason that I did not give this novel 5 stars is that it took me almost 100 pages not to dismiss Ames' narrative as simply a string of Sunday sermons with no apparent direction.  Perhaps that is my failing and not the author's.  Nevertheless, I urge the reader to perservere; you will be amply rewarded.	2005-04-26

I had been reading historical fiction, burdened with hundreds of pages of excruciating detail.  I was also reading current novels that were beginning to wear me down with unnecessarily complicated sentences (long introductory adverbial clauses) and repetitive words du jour (such as detritus, splayed and chrysalis)that appeared so often as if they were secret codes that readers were meant to divine.  Then my wife suggested \\"Plainsong,\\" and I was immeditately captivated by its spare, precise, yet compassionate and compelling prose.  Kent Haruf is a modern-day Hemingway, whose disarmingly simple sentences immediately draw the reader into the lives of simple people whose lives are fractured and frail.  Haruf writes so purely and convincingly about these people that I could not put down the novel until its conclusion. Haruf achieves what other authors cannot hope to accomplish:  That the simple narrative that rings true is always more difficult to write and therefore all the more satisfying to the reader.  A must read.	2005-04-24

For me, the novel transcends the story of life's losers in a decaying town and ultimately speaks to relationships and their failings and to the unrelenting pull of history on these relationships, as if history is a curse that cannot be expunged.  Russo's gift is his ability to realize fully believable and sympathetic characters and to draw the reader into their burdensome lives.  I have two reasons why I did not give this novel 5 stars: I felt that the novel was tedious at times and the plot sometimes languished.  In addition, the end of the novel was disappointing, as if there was no meaningful closure, revelation or epiphany, just the obligatory tying up of all the loose ends of his characters' lives.	2005-04-19

From the instant I began \\"Year Of Wonders,\\" I was engaged by this brutal and moving story of the plague.  Brooks deftly informs her characters with passion, suffering and hope.  While one may question Brooks' title as misplaced because of the unrelenting grief that hangs like a shroud over her characters and her readers, one realizes that the title aptly captures the meaning of her work:  That there is wonder and even glory in the human will to survive and prevail.	2005-04-16

For the first 70 pages I was fully engaged and interested, especially about the fascinating story of the artist who escaped from the Nazis during World War II.  Thereafter, I started skipping long sections of the novel owing to redundant descriptions and a very slow pace.  Unfortunately, Mr. Chabon took an original subject and got bogged down in excruciating detail.  It is indeed ironic that a novel about the fast-paced world of comic book characters reads more like a treatise on the art of the comic book.  Perhaps the editor and not the author is at fault.	2005-04-12
US	45829180	RJ6UVULK6Z9Y6	1400030382	321194841	The Piano Tuner	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Sensitive and Elegantly Crafted Historical Fiction	\\"The Piano Tuner\\" is historical fiction written in the style of Somerset Maughm and E. M. Forster, so carefully and elegantly wrought that the reader is immediately placed in the life, locale and period of the central character, a British piano tuner whose mission is to tune the piano of an eccentric, but seemingly important officer of the British crown, who is stationed in a strategic part of Burma that is not securely controlled by Britain.  There are no false or hesitant words by this accomplished and gifted writer, who at 26, has great promise.  The only reason that I did not give this novel 5 stars is that the ending is surprisingly abrupt and ill conceived.  Overall, a must read, however.	2005-04-11

However, I will eagerly await Ms. Proulx's future works, secure in the belief that even though she stumbled in \\"Postcards\\", she will ultimately write fiction as good as, if not better than, \\"The Shipping News.\\"	2005-04-11

Her stories were mesmerizing and riveting, and I have re-read them many times since. She was firmly rooted in the Southern grotesque, but she was able to transcend the stark terrain of the South and present remarkable studies of human foibles and the self searching for meaning and redemption.<br /><br />O'Connor had the uncanny gift to describe people, surroundings and life with astonishingly spare prose.  Her genius was that she could reveal the mystery and manners in us all.  Of particular note are \\"Revelation\\" and \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\\"  You must read this collection, and I promise that her stories will speak to you for years to come.	2005-04-03

Although he was at first an Abstract Expressionist artist who painted as convincingly as Still, Rothko, Kline and Motherwell, he was too much identified with the Bay Area, and therefore he did not have the imprimatur of the New York critics.  Then, in the 1950s, he was viewed as having betrayed the New York Abstract Expressionists, when he turned to figurative painting with David Park and Elmer Bischoff.  Eventually, until his death, he returned to abstraction with his much-acclaimed \\"Ocean Park\\" series.  And then the critics finally realized what had eluded them for years:  That Diebenkorn painted abstract realism, leaning more to one and then the other, all his life.<br /><br />Jane Livingston does a fine job of portraying the life of Richard Diebenkorn through his stunning paintings, which exemplify fire beneath the calm.  Be sure to read the Norland book as well, since his book is still the seminal book on Diebenkorn.	2005-04-02
US	45829180	R250938NJAFEC8	0142001740	378345448	The Secret Life of Bees	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Engaging Novel, Sometimes Lacking in Originality	This novel asks the reader to suspend disbelief in a series of remarkable events in the South.  I, for one, was able to believe the events because of the writer's clearly articulated characters, descriptive setting and clever plot.  Because the novel deals with the coming of age of a girl and her sense of self and place, I, as a man, did not think I could relate to the story.  Nevertheless, for the most part, I was pleasantly surprised that the issue of gender did not hinder my enjoyment of the novel.  Part of the reason for this is that Ms. Kidd writes in the secure and historic tradition of the Southern grotesque, in the manner of Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers and especially, Flannery O'Connor.  However, that is also why this novel suffers at times; it owes a lot to these writers and is therefore sometimes derivative.  I look forward to Ms. Kidd finding her own voice in future works.	2005-04-01

It places the reader in the time of Vermeer, and one believes that the speech, atmosphere and rituals of that time have been accurately rendered.  The characters are interesting, but they lack fire and resolve.  I had the gnawing feeling that I was reading a Dutch travelogue.  Not at all compelling.	2005-04-01

While I had difficulty understanding the novel's complex mathematics, I realized that I was not meant to solve these problems.  Rather, I was meant to comprehend the life of a boy who is unable to filter and resolve all of the information that the human mind routinely processes and who must come to terms with the harrowing ordeal of the outside world, and in particular, the stark realities of his dysfunctional parents.  From its beginning, this novel immediately engages the reader and it does not disappoint.	2005-04-01

In fact, I was spellbound by the plot and the writer's craft.  I willingly suspended disbelief and latched on to Pi's nightmarish journey as a testament to man's ability to hope, survive and prevail.  The writer's relentless and excruciating descriptions of this journey border on the surreal or the hyper-real, and that is my sole criticism.  The novel is sensational in all senses of the word, and perhaps gratuitous in its detailed depictions of such things as tiger turd and the agonizing deaths of animals aboard the life boat.  Nevertheless, the novel succeeds in capturing the reader's attention and more importantly, in making its statement of divine intervention in the presence of unspeakable horror.	2005-04-01

Despite having to deal with stylistic eccentricities (e.g., no nouns and conjunctions) and Newfoundland argot, I persisted and was handsomely rewarded.  I find myself searching for the right words to describe this remarkable novel of characters in turmoil, who are decayed and rejected and overwhelmed by the elements and life itself, and yet who perservere and finally find peace, sanity, acceptance and love, though tenuous and unsettling as their discovery may seem.  There is tremendous passion in this novel, a passion for survival that speaks to the soul.  In a word, brilliant.	2005-04-01

I was immediately engaged in the plot and characters and could not put the novel down until its conclusion.  Days after, the story stayed in my mind like a profound sermon.  My only reservation about the novel is it contains too many artistic contrivances and coincidences.  That aside, this a masterful and elegant piece of fiction that I strongly recommend.  The author has successfully engaged the reader in a story about people in a foreign country about which we know little, but more importantly, he has been able to transcend the setting and speak to us about timeless and eternal truths:  family, friendship, loyalty, betrayal, absolution and redemption.	2005-03-31

I was immediately drawn into the lives of the characters who are fully realized and compassionately drawn, and I longed for more when I finished her novel.  Although she writes of current issues, I had the sense that the reader was being transported to a different time, perhaps when Henry James and Edith Wharton crafted works of elegant fiction.  I look forward to future gems from Ms. Glass.	2005-03-31

Read \\"The Shipping News\\", \\"The Kite Runner\\", \\"Three Junes\\", \\"The Complete Short Stories of Flannery O'Connor\\".  While I realize that these books are fiction and Kidder's book is non-fiction, I still felt that I was reading a bad \\"Dragnet\\" script.	2005-03-30
