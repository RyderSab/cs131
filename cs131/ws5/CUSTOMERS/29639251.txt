I just finished reading this fact fill and well written book about the fall of Constantiniople to the Ottomans. I thought the Author has done a right proper job telling us about one of the turning points of History. When the Armies of Islam had reached the height of their power as a convential military power. This siege was to prove the last time that they could completely defeat an entrenched & determined European power. Soon after they would be stopped cold at the Gates of Vienna and at Malta. <br />  I also thought that the Author did a very good job describing the various facts and Characters of this battle. Especially those of the Sultan and his great drive to reduce the last bastion of the Roman Empire. (He was also one hard character that I would not want to met in a dark alley unless I was heavily armed and not alone!) Altogether I just wish I had this book with me when I was at Istanbul last.	2005-09-06

Otherwise we are doing a real disservice both to the young snuffie and threaten the national security of the nation at the same time. As witnessed by the poor performance of the Army in the 1st months of the Korean war. when Garrison troops were sent into battle not properly trained or motivated. <br />  The average person if you went up to them and say \\"Go kill that person over there with your trench knife\\" would look at you like you are from another world and rightly so! The properly trained and led soldier on the other hand would go and do it w/o a second thought. Most folks either don't know this or refuses to acknowledge this dirty little fact. this is also another reason why the Warrior has a real attitude toward the society that he guards. Because he knows that deep down his basic job is to stop bullets from hitting the ungrateful citizenry. <br />  That is also why the Military places such a high emphasis on ethics especially on those in a leadership position. I am just so glad that the Corp was gutsy enough to allow the author into Parris Island. I think that the author has done a great job in telling this most important story about the Rough, hard  men who are willing to do the hard & nasty. So that we can sleep safely in our beds.

A highly urinated off pig can really ruin your day! Been there & done that! (Pistols are fun to shoot but I don't want to count on then when the chips are down.)	2005-06-19

It also made me extremely glad that I did not live during his period of time! While he justly deserve the title \\"The Great\\".(No one else could of pull off the stabilisation of the tottering and rotten Roman Empire as he did even for a little while or establish the Byzantine Empire)The reader also is made aware by the Authors excellent writing and storytelling skills of certain not so nice facts. In that Constantine was one very hard, ruthless and extremely dangerous man to have around. Just ask his murdered by his orders & hand Son and Wife. I just wish the Author had spent a little more time on the founding of Constantinople but hey you can't have everything! Right?	2005-06-19

The Redcaps as the Military Police are known over there are the Police Department of the Army.  <br />  Theirs is a very tough, dirty & demanding job that is not done properly can blow up in your face as history has been shown in Iraq. It was also an eye opener to me in that he does not gloss over some of the problems the Brits faced with some of their more rowdy rascals. Especially after WWII when the Army it seems had more than their fair share of discipline problems with their National Servicemen. <br />  Also this Book is the exception that proves the general rule about the Osprey Series. I.E. you either have excellent illustrations or a well written text, very seldom do you have both. Fortunetley, Mr. Chappell has the skill & experience to do an outstanding job in both areas. His illustrations show a keen use of color, realism and a wealth of experience to back it up. <br /> It is also very clear that he has a lot of love and respect for good soldiers.

Who hopes to hold on to their ill gotten Empire against some very unfriendly Americans led by the Navy's version of Patton - Admiral William \\"Bull\\" Halsey.<br /><br />  What follows is one glorious fight what with some very effective Submarine attacks, the Last Battleship Fight where the enemy gets their T crossed, the Destruction/ Sacrifice of the Japanese Aircraft Carriers, the Japanese Battle Line going against Jeep carriers & the Bulls Run. It's one hell of a story and its told very well indeed!	2005-05-07

He takes you places where most folks will never be able to go to. He then takes what you think is nothing and shows you how it is really connected physically to the Hellenistic Era. He has opened my eyes to an era that I had not really thought important but I now see the errors of my ways. His choices of music, locations and his train of thought used in the film are outstanding. I just hope that it comes out in DVD soon. All together a mighty effort that pays off handsomely, Mega Kudos to all hands involved!	2005-05-07

As I was in the Army during the \\"Army Of Excellence\\", I thought Mr. Rottman had a couple of good points. But I also think that some of the problems faced by the Officers Corp should of been addressed like the zero defect mentality and the fear of making a mistake by Junior Officers.

The Author also tells of the overall thought and priorites of small arms developement during the great unpleasantries.  <br />  When the war started off almost everyone started with basically WWI Rifles with the notable exceptions of the US Army's excellent M1 Garand. I.E. very well built almost hand made rifles that had probadly had seen service in WWI. But with the ever growing demand by the troops for things that go bang. The Warring nations Ordnance departments had to start cutting corners. What with the use of sheet metal, plastic and increasing tolerances. This coupled with an ever growing demand for more and more personal fire power led to a new family of weapons. Like the Sten Gun, Grease Gun, the Schmeiser and the German Assault Rifle. So if you love guns and their history this is a must have book.	2005-05-07

The Ghurkhas are another story and its a great story. From their war with \\"John Company\\" in 1815 to the present, The Gurkhas have set a very high standard indeed. As an example,It was a sight to see at Buckingham Palace in watching them mount Guard in place of the Guards. I just can't picture the Legion doing the same job in Paris.

The one reason being that the Author had some very interesting kitchen details. For example, one reason Gen Auchinleck was not up to snuff against Rommel was that his wife had ran off with a \\"Brother\\" Officer.That and the rampant Tribalism of the various Regiments and higher command that weakened the 8th Army. \\"Monty\\" had to stomp down on this & the Officers Corp to get the army to play the same tune. That was really what I think was Montys greatest contribution to victory. <br />  I do not buy into his (The Author) denigration of Rommel. The man held off the best of the British Empire and the United States threw at him for almost 2 years. That is a very powerful fact to over come & the author does not overcome it.That & I disagree with his opinion of Patton and his efforts. But no one has or can really point forth a universally agreeded opinion for that Great Captain. <br />That and I do not think that he went after Mark Clark hard enough. His glory ride to take Rome instead of knocking off the German Army should of caused his recall but that is my humble opinion. <br /> The really strong point of the book is in his coverage of the smaller countries and their background. I found his coverage of Greece was very interesting. That and his coverage of the siege of Malta was good and that Islands impact upon the North Africa Campaigns with their interdiction of the supply line of the Axis forces. (I still think that if Rommel had gotten a bigger portion of supplies, the Germans would of been enjoying the Brothels of Cairo) <br />Another being how the Med was used as a proving ground of allied leadership and equipment with the weeding out of the weak sisters.This is a fact that generally gets overlooked and was a valuable factor toward final victory. A totally green Army would not of survived the Camapigns in Europe otherwise. Having some veterans and good leadership are critical to winning the fight. <br />  His closing idea that the Med sucked in the Allies to a tarbaby really rung true as the Americans are still there with a good size fleet patroling there today. <br />  All in all a good sturdy effort and well worth the money spent. <br />	2005-02-28

I can recommended it most highly as it is with Mr. Farwell's other books	2005-01-14

It helps remind yourself that the grass is not alwqays greener on the other side of the fence. That and one must be careful for what you wish for. <br />  I rank this up with the novel Lest the Darkness Falls and a good rainy day book to read for pleasure and enlightenment.	2004-08-04

The subject being the change over from the &quot;Classic&quot; era to the start of the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. It is during this time that the Legions change into Field Armies and Garrison Troops because of the pressures of the Barbarians and the ecomonic collaspe of the Empire. (I shall not go into the near constant state of civil wars between the competing thugs, nutters and other sods that wanted to wear the purple.)<br /> The Illustrations alone are worth the price but the text,maps are an added bonus. I have to agree with the other reviewer in the the B/W photos are the only down side of this book. All in all a very good buy for those with a taste for this type of history.	2004-07-08

Then this is a good place to spend some memorable reading time. Its a pity Mr Skelton has gone to the big gun shop in the sky.	2004-04-02

His work is always interesting , realistic , convincing &amp; coupled with a very sly sense of humor. If your forte is Military History and want an idea of what a warrior looks like from the past.  You could do a whole lot worse than this series. (I myself own over 300 of them and use them a lot in my classroom) The only down side of this series is that the written part is usally not up to the caliber of the illustrations.	2003-12-18

That and my love of the history of the Easter Roman Empire.  Both reason's were amply  rewarded by this book.<BR>  It just re enforces my gratitude to live in 21st Century America and not then &amp; there. That and to Thank God for our Founding Fathers for having established the Republic. <BR>  In that Justinian was a very evil &amp; self centered man who lived in a very hard time &amp; place. Altogether He was an adventurer of the worst kind who left a wake of death destruction where ever he went.	2003-12-09

It covers the period when the US Army hit its stride and became one of the finest fighting Armies in history. That and when its Officers Corp brought forth such leaders like Patton, Truscott and Ridgeway who would write some great pages in the history of our wars.<BR>  It is also a great German Victory when w/o air cover and little or no support from the Italians. Did the German Army conduct a fighting retreat from the island to the mainland of Italy.Hence the controversy.	2003-11-18
