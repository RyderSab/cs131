It was an enjoyable story that speaks positively of parent/child relationship. Yes, it had many of the usual cliches of romances.  But the twists and turns of the plot make it unpredictable.  It is one of the few romances showing love between two older people.  The dialogue seems real and riveting. <br />Stephanie Webb, a creative worker in an advertising firm, decides to look for a husband to match with her widowed mother.  She finds a possibility- the father of her boss.  Her boss, of course, is handsome and smart.  And she falls in love with him.  They collaborate to spy on their parents- and their parents are discussing them, hoping that their children will marry and give them grandchildren.  <br />It's a perfect book for the inevitable airplane ride, the beach, the doctor's office, or even a rainy day with nothing to do.	2004-04-23

The epic story spans through the history of India and Burma with prose that makes you feel as if you are right there.  The book contained vivid descriptions of the teak trade;the trees are slashed to kill them, then they are felled, then they are pushed into the river where the water pushes them to a place where thy are tied into rafts.  The rafts are floated to a timberyard for sale.  <br />There also were descriptions of rubber plantations and the various political movements for independence.<br />I read this book while sick and it does take a lot of time to read.  Also, I had to reread it and write down the family members to keep them straight and fully appreciate the novel.  It is stronger on historic detail than on characterization.<br />At the end of the book, the author tells the reader about his research sources, which were substantial.  <br />It is worth reading for both entertainment and education	2004-01-16

Carroll, the author, describes being raised by a neglectful mother in a poverty-stricken area, his pitfalls and prmotions within United Parcel Service, his pilot project which showed UPS the work potential of people on welfare and his experience standing on the podium with the President of the United States.<br />While reading the book, you feel like you are right with him.  For example, he describes the story of his first day of work where he isn't trained and makes significant mistakes.  He leaves the rollers in the truck, fails to sort the packages, and comes close to losing his job.  He doesn't hesitate to tell the reader about weaknesses- giving you a sense he is a well-rounded real person willing to share of himself.  <br />This book also avoids many of the cliches and unreality of the typical \\"rags to riches\\" autobiography.  For example, he speaks of two times in his life where he basically gives up and becomes apathetic.  At one point in high school, his counselor tells him that he is not smart enough to go to college.  He internalizes that message and partially believes it.  He flirts with gang activity and drug dealing.  He also gets turned down for promotions at United Parcel Service and makes the decision that many people make in that circumstance- to do his job, but not try to do more.<br />In each of these cases, he gets his ambition back and his life on track.  A friend of his tells him about the Basic Educational Opportunty Grant which he uses to get his tuition paid.  And, he is promoted at UPS four years later to be a division manager at the Lawnsdale Hub.  <br />We are spared the usual impression of a person who remains totally determined and courageous under all circumstances.<br />Yet, he also speaks with detail about motivating employees in a union shop where the work is monotonous and the lifting is heavy.  He describes the internal politics where he persuades the managers to hire people on welfare.<br />There are many lessons here-and it's very entertaining.  I read it three times.	2002-10-07

McKinley's Worst Storm Ever	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Practical Examples of a Positive Attitude	The author was part of a team that spent ten days on an ice shelf on Mount McKinley, trapped by a storm that packed 110 MPH winds, minus 47 degree air temperatures.  The team of nine mountaineers (2 professional leaders and seven amateurs) became the first group that reached the summit in 1992. When reading this book, you feel like your friend is sittling beside you telling their dramatic story.<br />What makes this book unique is the candid descriptions of the author's thought processes and sensations.  I read many books about how to succeed and reach goals and most of them suffer from vagueness.   This book does not have a single platitude about attitude.  It describes clearly and practically what she does to keep herself on track.<br />For example, when food got scarce, one of the team members lined up for seconds before everyone had eaten first.  The author tells her reaction.<br />&quot;I looked away to hide my growing rage from Craig and anyone else who might be looking my way.  I worked to focus on the beauty that surrounded me instead of Jack's selfishness. <br />All around, hues of pink washed the sky and melded into the soft blue shadow of the earth against the atmosphere.....&quot;<br />She is illustrating an important success principle- that each of us determines where our attention goes.  Through controlling our attention and thoughts, we can change our emotional state.  She shows this to us- here and throughout the book.  Her descriptions of conversation make for interesting and gripping dialogue, although she does come through as overly critical of others at times.  <br />She tells her motivations for mountaineering, the dynamics of the team, and the actions of the two professional guides that made them effective leaders.   For example, at one point, she has trouble with a weak and exhausted teammate who is roped behind her.  The leader asks her what is wrong and puts that team member behind him, taking the hardest task on himself.<br />She conservesenergy, turns inward, has a great sense of humor, and solves problems.  This book would help management consultants and seminar leaders for examples of success principles.	2002-10-03

Examples are the sports market, the movie star market and the publishing market; The reasons given are;<br />-Technology.  National distribution channels such as network television make it easier for an individual to penetrate the market.  For example, at one time villages and towns had their own musicians.  Now a singer can make a CD and sell it nationally.<br />-Falling transportation and tariff costs.    Goods have gotten lighter.  It is easier to send computer discs all over the world than books.  CD's are lighter than phonograph records<br />-- Mental shelf space constraints.    We have a limit to the number of items we can keep  in our head...&quot;the amount of information we can actually use is thus a declining fraction of the total information available.&quot;<br />-Weakening of regulations and civil society.  At one time, informal and formal rules limited the winner take all markets.  Now, like free agents in baseball, the top performers have the leverage to demand high prices.  <br />-Self-reinforcing processes.  This is another way of saying &quot;success begets success.&quot; For example, a sales person does well and  gets bigger customers.   A person does well and the word of mouth referral causes them to saturate the market.  This virtuous cycle increases the income and power of top  performers.<br />The author argues that winner take all markets are not good for society.  People are unrealistically optimistic about their own chances of winning &quot;a prize.&quot;  Thus they are siphoned off from other productive endeavors.  <br />This book was helpful to me in understanding today's economy and job market.   If anything, the winners are doing better than ever today, long after the book was published.  Just take a look at the latest article on CEO salaries.	2002-10-02

It is the only book about the 1996 Mount Everest disaster written by a Sherpa, the indigenous people who work as porters and guides for commercial expeditions.   I have read about five of the books written after the disaster, and wondered about the Sherpa point of view as there was surprisingly little mention of them.<br />The other books only mentioned them in passing and in terms of what the Sherpas did for the expedition.  Jamling Tenzig Norgay, the author, experiences this attitude.  After the disaster, he and his team stay at Base Camp.  He wrote, \\"The other Sherpas were hanging out in a depressed funk.  Some of them hadn't gotten so much as a thank-you from the guided clients whom they assisted down the mountain, often after exceptional struggle.  The clients simply disappeared, some without saying goodbye.  We notice this kind of behavior.\\"<br />Norgay was skeptical about Buddhism at the beginning of the climb- but gradually came to believe in it.   He requests and receives divinations from llamas- and uses their information as part of his decision-making.  The book provides fascinating beginner's information that is accessible to someone like me who is just learning about Buddhism.  He describes spirituality in a practical matter.<BR>  <br />For example, he says, \\"in the icefall, as in the mountains, we hope we have been imbued with enough tsin-lap to handle any situation.  Tsin-lap is roughly translated as \\"blessing\\", but it really means the mental ability and strength to allow our minds to be changed in the direction of complete awareness.  When we pray to the wisdom deities, to the Buddhas, we pray for tsin-lap.\\"  He talks about the fact that he and the other Sherpas who carry loads for the team hike over each trail numerous times.  This improves their athletic ability and knowledge of the mountain.  <br />Norgay, spent over a decade in the United States and was also deeply familiar theclients who were paying to climb the mountains who were mostly from industrialized countries.  The author does not idealize the Sherpas.  He describes the positive parts of their culture, but also tells the reader that the main reason they are on the mountain is as a profession.  It is to earn money.  He explains that many of the Sherpas risked their lives for their clients during the disaster.  But some expected a large award to be posted on the radio.  It is not clear whether they might have saved the lives of their guide had an award been offered.  Wong Chu, the sirdar responsible for logistics, kept a stick in the kitchen and \\"would whack miscreant Sherpas on the butt when they acted up.  `You came here to do work.' he would say loudly.\\"  <br />Norgay is the son of Tenzing Norgay Sherpa who accompanied Edmund Hillary on the first successful attempt of the summit of Mount Everest.  His story is interwoven with his father's story.  And by the end of the book, you can see that the son had climbed two mountains- a real one and the metaphorical on that each of us must climb to integrate our past with our present and future.	2002-10-01
