It was just nothing new, we see this stuff everyday on the soap operas.  David Lawrence was a bit on the wild side and his wife Jessica had some real problems.   I was looking for a bit more relationship therapy or what really happens when a loving husband and wife have an affair in the marriage.  Nothing, except the affair, was realistic, so I guess it was just more entertaining.	2003-08-12

I like this book because it was entertaining, funny and in some cases voiced thoughts that I have had while pregnant.  My first pregnancy was great and I had many of the same fears that Amy had and then some.  Amy had issues that every woman deals whether pregnant or not.  Every woman thinks her husband is weird at some point in their marriage or that their grandmother may already be on the other side of the rocker already or that her best friend won't be because she is pregnant.  I could really relate and I even got a chance to laugh while doing it.  Good job and the best part, is that all of the pains and worries are well worth it once you see that little face looking right back at you.	2003-06-17

Ina was an interesting person who appeared to be a good person, great mother and decent photographer.  However, she had some problems in her life and it seems like she was always looking for someone else to blame for her misfortune.  Her mother was never around, David wasn't the man she needed but she definitely wanted, Paige was the perfect neighbor who had it all but was judgemental and lived the life that Ina wanted.  Jay brought her total joy and total frustration at the same time.  He provided her with a stable life with three beautiful children, but after his indiscretion, caused to have to live a life that she never wanted or asked for.  So, all through the book if something wasn't right, then Ina never owned it.  I wondered if she had lived out her true life if she would have had all the problems she incurred.  <BR>The book was good, but not extraordinary like her others.	2003-02-15

I expected a different ending and it was ordinary.  The book was well written, it came from an unusual point of view and it was an interesting story line, but I didn't find the &quot;special&quot; something that it had to make it a bestseller on all the lists.  Susie Salmon was a real 14 year old girl that was experiencing life through the eyes of the world she left behind.  It is not a mystery if that is what you are looking for, but it is a good rainy day book for the weekend.  Enjoy.	2003-01-01

I loved this book, I think my new tradition will be to read this book and watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation!  The two together have me laughing hysterically.  I really liked Luther and Nora and can imagine them being my next door neighbor.  They were two people that had done the Christmas thing year after year and wanted something different.  Everyone wants that, but this year it backfired.  Everything was so classic, the office party, the calendar and fruitcake sales, the shopping, the food and the tree.  Luther handled it all so well.  However, when it all boils down, Christmas is all about family, friends and holiday cheer.  Totally enjoyable book.	2002-12-28

It would be more entertaining to the people of the DC metropolitan area because we can recognize the area and the descriptions.  However, the story line was nothing more than you would see on the Young and the Restless or any other soap opera.  I personally don't think that people of such wealth and power are so shallow. I understand that it was totally fiction, and for the sole purpose of entertainment, but it was nothing special.  The story plots weren't exactly cliffhangers, but they did leave the reader hanging waiting for something good to happen.  I felt the story of Lee and finding her father add absolutely nothing to the story.  Jolene was a joke and Barbara was even more of a joke to put up with Bradford.  Candace and her new revealation could have been really good and the relationship between Ashley and Kenyatta, but that didn't amount to much.  I actually got excited about Patrick and Pearl and that didn't really fold out too much. Basically, no one had much self-esteem and hid their lives behind the walls of Silver Lakes.  Many of the plots could have been better developed, but they weren't.  Expected so much mored.  I am also proud to say that the people of P.G. County and the community being discussed in this book are very noble and decent people.	2002-10-25

With every novel about Raymond Tyler and Basil Henderson, I say that I can't take anymore and the story line is getting old.  However, I can no longer say that.  Each novel gets better and the drama gets so intense.  This novel was entertaining, an easy read and funny.  I love the lifestyle of the high and mighty.  None of it seems realistic, but that is what fiction is all about.  It can take you into another world that seems so unrealistic.  This novel does just that and it was GOOD!  I don't see this becoming a movie or television sitcom, but it is doing just fine as a serial novel.  Keep it up, because I am hooked.  I can't imagine what Yancey B., Basil, Raymond, Zola and Davis McClinton could possibly do now, but something tells me that E. Lynn Harris will come up with something and that novel will be just as good as its predecessors!	2002-10-04

I actually liked this one better than the 1st to Die.  2nd Chance had more suspense and better story line.  It was written in the traditional James Patterson style, but it had a little romance (Cindy and the minister), a lot of suspense, some real issues (Boxer and her father), and then the Womens Murder Club style to get together and solve the mysttery.  The Murder Club even had a close one and that brought a lot of suspense to the novel.  I thought this was a well written novel and makes me that more anxious for the next one to come out.  I do hope the mystery is truly hard to solve, because that make the storyline that much better.  2nd Chance was a little difficult to solve, and that is what made it good and easy to read.  You couldn't put it down until you found the suspect!	2002-08-26

It is easy to read, so it didn't take very long and you can easily get into it and start cheering for the main characters.  I definitely see this one becoming a movie and Toby McGuire playing Jack.  I can't quite picture Pauline, but someone really down to earth and sweet because that is who her character exemplified.  This was definitely a mystery and a small love story that added to the plot.  I guess maybe I liked it more because we just returned from Martha's Vineyard and I could picture the small island and the beach scenes.<BR>The main characters were well rounded and you got a feeling for each of them. They seemed as if they could be \\"real\\" people that you would meet on the street. However, the story stretched a bit on the imagination, it was a good plot.<BR>I highly recommend this book whether you are on vacation, at the beach or just spending a quite afternoon reading.  I hope Mr. Patterson does more books like this one.  He is such a good writer and I am a big fan of both the Alex Cross Mysteries and the Women's Murder Club.  Can't wait for the next one!	2002-07-25

This book was poignantly written and really touched the heart.  It was very easy to read and had some valuable life lessons in it.  I took away from the story that every person should live life as if it were your last moment on earth.  Suzanne was very wise in her years and she had a lot of love to offer her husband and son.  I wish life could be as happy and joyous as she wrote about it in her journal.  The story was sad and I cheered for Katie and Matt and their new life together.  I had hoped all through the story that it would have a happy ending and that something positive would come of Suzanne's tragedy.  <br />This was well done and leave the reader with a lot to think about when dealing with life's issues.  Life is always giving us clues as to what is next, we just need to slow down and really see what those clues are telling us.  Good read.	2002-06-19

As a stay-at-home Mom of two, I really enjoyed reading how other women with much wealth got along on a day to day basis!  I am sure there were quite a few over-dramatized scenes, but not that far from the truth.  Daily I see women with their &quot;Nannies&quot; and  only 1 child and the Mothers are always complaining about how they have no time for themselves or to get a thing done, because of the child.  It is truly sad, but the kids didn't ask to be brought into the situation, they are just kind of scheduled around.  <br />I always wondered about the life of Nanny and how they felt about raising someone else's child.  Mrs. X was a totally trip and througout the entire book I kept waiting for Nanny to let her have it!  I wanted Mrs. X to get a totally wake-up call and come into reality.  I wish the book had been a tad bit longer so we could see how Nanny fared with H.H. and Ms. C.  Those were two parts of the book that were really juicy!!  There were somethings left untold and I guess we could use our imagination a bit, but nonetheless, the story was still very humorous and very funny.  Job well done.	2002-06-11

This was cute, funny and sometimes right.  The first two sagas of Lily and Sandra were really good and kept my attention the entire time.  The spirits were right on the money.  LaShawndra's story started to get a little boring and the name calling got a bit out of control, but her story needed to be told to make the others come to full circle.  They all had issues and I am sure every woman could relate in some way or another to one of these women.  <br />I was glad to see them come to a happy ending and to love one another like family should.  Overall, this was a really good book and easy to read.  Highly recommended.	2002-06-03

First of all, I have to give Mr. Patterson kudos for going into the minds of women and getting it pretty accurate.  There were many times in the book that I forgot that this was written by a male!  I really liked Lindsay Boxer and all her friends were real people.  No one was too pretty or too rich or too artificial.  The story line was a little imaginative, but it made the book more interesting.  The &quot;WOMEN's&quot; club got together and really hammered out the details and nailed the killer.  I was cheering by the end.  The title did not give away the story at all and it was a bit of a tear jerker.  I can't wait to start the next novel.  I am still an Alex Cross fan, but I will definitely make room for Lindsay Boxer and her gang!	2002-05-09

There were so many questions in the first novel, Sugar, and This Bitter Earth, really made those questions clear.  I wanted to know how Sugar came to be a prostitute and how she met Mary and Mercy.  How did she come to know the Lacey sisters?  This was such a mesmorizing novel that all the answers were given and it kept my attention.  Sugar is a remarkable woman and I was glad that she was able to hlep Mercy as she had been helped by Pearl.  A lot of circles came to a close and completed the story.  Pearl, Joe, Seth and JJ all had some type of closure in their hearts when they were able to come face to face with the killer of their beloved Jude and Jude was able to rest peacefully.<br />The Bitter Earth is one of the better reads of 2002.  Hope to read more of Ms. McFadden's writings.	2002-04-21

This one was a little harder to get into and it flowed really slowly.  It was also difficuly not to imagine that Alex Cross was being played by Morgan Freeman!  I wish they hadn't made a movie of the series so soon.  I wish Alex's kids had more of an intergral part of the stories, bit that might not be a good move.  <br />I was a little disappinted in the truth telling about the 'Mastermind', but I guess it helps with solving the current stoies.  It was pretty predictablble about the identity of the Mastermind, but that made the story go a lot quicker.  I liked the novel, and I didn't like it.  It was a little too easy to read and not challenging enough.	2002-03-11

I really enjoyed all these short stories as much as her other ones.  I can't say that I have a favorite because I enjoy them all equally!  This one has more of a theme in all four stories.  All the women were hard, hard-working women with children to raise and doing with it no-good men.  However, they all were able to find love and it was true love.  That is what I like about Ms. Coopers stories, they may be stories of strength and struggle, but love always conquers.

I like that Ms. Johnson-Hodge could write about real life characters and make them interesting.  I don't think that anyone's life is truly exciting and everyday is another journal sharing experience.  That is why I liked this novel.  In some way or another, I could relate to all the characters.  In my present life, Britney, is the most like me and her character seemed to have the most impact on the story for me.  Throughout the book she didn't seem to receive the respect and attention that the other women did and then all of a sudden she demanded it, whether &quot;it&quot; came from her friends or her husband.  I am glad she found her self-worth in the novel.  As for the main character, Sandy, I thought she didn't really deal with her issues and Randall.  She never really gave him that piece of her mind that was boiling over or so it seemed.  I think a lot of conversations weren't had it the story that should have been.  <br />Overall, the novel was well written, but it wasn't a show stopper.

Cora, Emma and Parris were all strong women in their era of time.  The sad thing about their stories were that their lives were all sheltered from truths.  Cora was not aware of the ways of the world because of her mother, Emma was not aware of what unconditional love felt like because of her mother, and Parris didn't know why she felt incomplete in her life's trials because of her mother.  The one great thing about their stories is that they all met and loved strong men.  Joshua, David, Michael and Nick, even Frank, were strong men that truly loved these women.  The ending was very touching and very good.  I couldn't put this book down and finished it in one setting.

I had no idea what to expect, but I must say that it took me a minute to really think of how to review this book.  I could not put it down for one minute because it was so emotional and the characters were so real.

Hosanna seemed to enrich all the lives she touched and she ws able to do that from her resting place.<BR>There were a lot of parallels between Asia and Matriece and it was nice to see their similarities come together full circle. I thought Ms. Campbell envolved each character and we got a chance to meet and learn each one. I thought the most interesting characters were Sam and Mooney. They just seemed to be my favorites. Why? They both had redeeming spirits and had achieved more than just monetary wealth. I think Hosanna was there to help them in her own little way.<BR>Matriece didn't really redeem her mother but healed herself by her own actions. She and Vonette has healing to do and they both seemed to have done it on their own, Hosanna was just their guiding lights.<BR>I felt sorry for most of the caucasian people in this novel because none of them seem to have much luck, but they all seemed to have gotten what they deserved.

I thought the idea was a good one where you have 4 guys protecting the interest of one of their friends, his sister.  I liked that they (the guys) were tight and they didn't let a lot of trivial problems break up their relationship with one another.  I like that each one had a good saga behind their personal relationship, but i must say that I liked Ibn's the best.  The ending was also real, it wasn't sappy and it didn't leave you hanging.  It also let room for a sequel if there wanted to be.  This book was easy to read and it was funny.  It kept you wanting more.  If I could have given it a 10 I would have.  Good job, Mr. Major.	2001-07-06

This book was very well written and had my interest from the first page.  I liked it even more when I realized that I just finished reading Michael Datchers' wife's book, Resurrecting Mingus.  I really got a feel for the personalities of both writers and will be looking for more of their work.  Mr. Datcher lead an interesting life and I saw how he was able to &quot;raise fences&quot; to become the man that he is today.  I wish that all our African-American boys had the inspiration that he had from his adopted mother to become a great man of today.  I hope that Michael continues writing poetry, because it was so real.  He hasd inspired me to write new vows to my own husband!	2001-06-21

Elaine, Carl, Eva and even Glenda were true.  This story had a lot of real life to it and it didn't seem totally fictionalized.  There were some plots to the story that would have made it a tad bit more interesting, like if Mingus and Steve had actually had a realtionship.  This considering that Mingus' parents were going through similar interracial problems.  Mingus appeared to have a lot of problems with relationships, especially her family and I was happy to see that she was dealing with them by the end of the story.  I would have like to have seen how the situation turned out with Eva and Mingus or even Mingus and her mother, but it probably better left to the imagination.  Good read.	2001-06-17

A lot of us women take our issues to our hair, and it is not an ethnic thing.  Tyson Edwards, the egocentric character, had it pinned just right.  However, I was a little miffed that Venus Johnston, who had it going on in every other respect, had to feel that she needed to do something drastic to bring distinction to herself.  I really don't think cutting her hair was going to have much of an impact like she thought it would.  I understood her plight with Clint Fairchild, but rushing him wasn't going to make it happen any better or sooner.  The character I really felt sorry for was Kandi, she was in a no good triangle with one man and then got involved as the rebound with another.  She was the one that should have cut her hair off.  Trisha Thomas did a dynamite job with bringing this to full circle for us and showing that a woman doesn't have to rely on her vanity to make it in life.	2001-05-28

It is sad to know that what some misinformed person does one day will come back and haunt another some other day.  Kenzie probably could have been a very different person than what she was because of the people that loved her.  Unfortunately her father knew no different and probably ruined some very special lives.  I am glad that she came to know the truth and was able to forgive Hy-Lo for his wrongdoings.  This was a strong book that had some very valuable lessons in it.

I was truly sorry to read that the topic matter was of a Baptist Minister with a promising congregation, but the story was good because it could be true.  I was proud of the main character, Tanya, for sticking to her guns and looking out for herself and her daughter, because they are who matters.  Curtis, who is no-good anyway, got what he deserved.  The ending was surprising and had a good finale.  I was intrigued througout the entire story and was hoping and praying for James the whole way through.

When the day is done, it really doesn't matter what color you are, just that you are a decent person.  Eulilie did her step family a disjustice by planting seeds in their heads that they were better than anyone else.  They actually ended up being misfits of society and couldn't function in the real world.  Lila seemed to have the most decent heart, but it took some time for it to come out. Lucretia and Linda were long gone.  Gil was in another world that he had to deal with.  He seem to have a lot of hate built up from the death of his biological mother dying and he was never able to face it and deal with it.  I was glad that Sandra's life turned out to be a fairy-tale romance, she seemed have been worthy of true happiness.<br />Over the all the story was decent, but there were a lot of spaces that dragged on and didn't even seem pertinent to the storyline.  The topic matter is age-old and not that important to think about anymore.  There were some good twists to the story that kept me reading, but overall it wasn't anything that realistic.  I hope there aren't people that blind in this world today!	2001-03-01

She thought because the book was about a &quot;Stay-At-Home Mom&quot; that I could relate to it.  At first, I thought Regina was spineless and ordinary just like the author described her to be, but then as I read on, I realized that it was the personalities that surrounded her where the ones that were ordinary and they were trying to put Regina down to boast themselves.  Regina's life took a 360 when she divorced her husband, Russell, of 14 years and everyone elses life went downhill.  Regina could really inspire someone to look within themself and find their strength.  Regina left the &quot;comfortable&quot; lifestyle of a husband and a home to challenge herself.  She quit her job because of an instinct and went out to see what she was made of.  All of her family and friends doubted her efforts, but in the end, they found that she was the winner and was made of some pretty EXTRAodinary material.  NOt that I am going to leave my husband, but this book has inspired me to see what I have to offer this world other than being a mother and wife.  I recommend this book for a good read and something that will make you feel good when you are done reading it.  You will walk away feeling rejuvenated, I guarantee it!  Thanks Donna Hill.	2001-02-11

I think this is the best book I have read in all of 2000 and probably all of 2001!  <br />Without giving away the whole story line, it is ashame that families don't get along when the ones they love are alive and when they die, they finally get it together and love each other like they never have before.  I loved all the characters and how they evolved.  Their problems were realistic for the order of their birth.  The oldest generally feels they have to be strong for the family and know everything.  The youngest usually feels that they can't make a decision because everyone makes it for them.  Paris and Janelle fit the description to a T.  The best character of all was of course, Ms. Viola Price.  Our Mamas always know what is best for us even when we think they don't know what is going on.  And as usual Moms have the last word.  Viola knew her children, husband and grandchildren and she wasn't about to let anyone do them wrong.  She was a true Matriarch.<br />I started this book on Sunday and couldn't put it down until Wednesday night.  This book reads like a real life event.  It isn't dry in any spaces and it never drags on.  I think everyone will be able to relate to a character of some characteristics of one.  I won't say who I relate to, but it is in there.  I agree with Ms. McMillan that this wouldn't make a good movie, but a good television series.  It is too much like the movie 'Soul Food', but I hope see great things happen for this book.  Terri, it was well worth the wait and I hope to see more of this type of book in the future!	2001-02-02

This was the best of the three that she has written.  It was so refreshing to read about true adult love.  There was none of the teenage, playing games romance that we read in a lot of African-American fiction novels.  This story had a few turns to it that were a little difficult to comprehend.  However, the love between Verdi and Johnson is what you always dream of having for yourself.  I felt so sorry for Verdi that she didn't come into her own for 40 years, but she got there and I cheered her on all the way.  I really believed that faith and spirit kept Verdi and Johnson unmarried to others for over 20 years.  They were meant to be together.  Rowe had a lot of demons that he needed to deal with and he was not dealing with them which in turn fueled him to keep control over Verdi for so long.  He needed to heal himself and let Verdi heal herself.  The love scenes between Johnson and Verdi were like FIRE!  I can see why my best book buddies rated this book so highly.  Diane, I hope to see more from you in the near future, because you definitely have a gift to share with the world.	2001-01-26

Desi and Sharon seemed to have one of those genuine friendships that many women would like to have and that was nice to see.  I was glad Meredith got what she deserved in the end.  God definitely does not like Ugly!  The characters were well rounded and kind of easy to predict, but they all added to the plot.  Lolita if you keep dishin' em out, I'll keep reading.

I have to say that this book is one of the best written books I have read for 2000.  I wasn't sure in the beginning, but when Annette and her mother moved to Richland, Ohio, stuff started happenin'!  It really annoyed me that Annetee wouldn't tell anyone that Mr. Boatwright was molesting her and threatening her.  Annette never really developed a good self esteem or confidence in herself, so I could see why that happened.  Her Mother wasn't much of a figure for Annette to mold after, so she didn't have much opportunity to become a &quot;woman&quot;.  I felt sorry for her throughout most of her life, and hope the best for her.<br />Now, Ms. Rhoda is another story in herself!  I couldn't believe some of the stuff she got away with.  I can't say it without giving away the story, but Rhoda was not your typical girl next door.  She was sweet and attractive, but she was a devil in a blue dress!<br />Ms. Monroe really brought all her characters together to make a TERRIFIC story.  Annette, Rhoda, Muh Dear, Scary Mary, Pee Wee, Mr. Boatwright, Judge Lawson, Levi, Florence and all the other characters blend together create a storyline that definitely shows God Don't Like Ugly.  You reap what you sow.  I don't think Annette will ever do anything without thinking of the consequences!	2001-01-02

This book was a bit of a mystery in the waiting with some really interesting twists and turns.  Ramona was a true character and she didn't fall to far from the tree because Mae was the original character.  These two women really had some major healing and bonding to do to make their relationship what it started out to be.  I am glad that Shern, Victoria and Bliss were able to come into their lives and make the tempest rise in that house on Addison Street.

Marissa judged a book by its cover and then ended up wanting to read it from front to back.  I liked how Ms. Mallette made every character suspicious.  You knew it wasn't someone obvious, but then you suspected everyone.  I also liked how the romance between Levi and Marissa was intertwined into the suspense.  I would never have suspected the character that is was, but I didn't rule him/her out.  Although, Marissa had it coming to her, why should she get away with it when &quot;it&quot; was morally wrong.  Marissa is no saint, but she also was hurt in the process by a past love, so some of it was justifiable.  I was glad Levi came into her life when he did.  Everyone woman needs her knight in shining armour and that he was for Marissa.  Very suspenseful and entertaining.  Goes to show, you never know who you are dealing with these days!	2000-12-03

I have to admit, when Ms. Johnson-Hodge begins a character, they generally work my nerves and I begin to think they are really stupid, but she develops her characters so well and they always come out on top.  I got a little tired of Sandy and Adrian's up and down relationship, I began to realize that is true life and most relationships go through that cycle.  I was sick of Janice and proud of her in the end.  I was really cheering for all the characters because they all seemed to find some type of peace and love in their lives.  I was very sad that Adrian had to pass the earth, but it taught everyone else a lesson about life and love, that was the important part. I was also happy for the othr characters like Britney and Janice and that their lives were coming full circle. Sandy is a very strong woman and had a lot to deal with for any woman, and for that she deserved all respect.  This was an excellent book for a good dose of reality.  Kudos to Ms. Johnson-Hodge for being such a true writer.

I didn't know what to expect from the book, but I had an idea of what it was going to be about.  I thought the beginning was pretty typical in that the characters were &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot;, but I guess anyone that we are attracted to, that would be the case.  I got a little bored with Imagany and Elliott because they were always all over one another, then when Anthony reentered the picture and Imagany had to face her demons then the book took another turn.  It got exciting when Caprice and Carl were married and Elliott's career took off.  I was proud of Imagany and how she handled her past.  The book BECAME a page turner somewhere in the middle and I rather enjoyed it.  I guess the lesson learned is that we can't run from our past because it always comes back to teach us a lesson before we can move on with our future.	2000-11-15

I really thought we would have heard more about the transformation of a divorcee to an independent woman, aka Mom, daughter, professional worker, friend, lover and roommate.

I thought the situations were real and they could be true, I thought Mr. Dickey did an excellent job folding the stories out.  I am glad that most characters had a happy ending.

I had questions that never got answered, like how old was Joseph?  What was the terrible secret that Sophie was going to find out in New York and how come we didn't hear about it again in Haiti?  I understand that being &quot;tested&quot; was such a crucial and demeaning process in their lives, but I didn't consider it a secret.  The book left many gaps like Sophies teenage years, her marriage to Joseph, her birth of her daughter, how she developed bulimia from being married and not being able to perform sexually.  I was more miffed about how she and her mother could become confidants after not speaking and having no contact for how ever many months or years.

Ronnie and Celeste thought they had seen it all until they came to Prosper, NC.  This book was like 'Soul Food' with better twists and turns and more drama.  I cried and cheered at the end that the family came together.  It is amazing what communication between family members can do and what harm secrets can create.  I hope that every mother and daughter can read this book and get something from it.

Herbie and Ethel had their issues, but Herbie continued to have  faith in the woman he truly loved.  Ethel knew she wasn't 'Mommy' material,  but she wanted what was best for her daughters.

Warm Hands is a book about real love and the truest love you can have  outside of your family and friends is the love for yourself.  I was really  annoyed with Mya Williams in the beginning in how she thought that she was  defined by a man/relationship.  As I read further, I see that she was just  like her mother, Claudia, and accepted what was presented to her in  whatever form.  Granted, Jeff was a good guy and really loved Mya, but if  she loved and trusted herself enough she would have never betrayed herself  or Jeff with Vincent.  After the relationship with Jeff was over, Mya  needed to learn how to rely on her own girth to move on with her life, not  that of Chloe or that of Gail, what Mya could hold.  I cheered for her  towards the end when she married herself.  I thought that was so profound  and think that every person should find that connection with themself  before joining a union with another person.

It is very hard to begin a life again after a painful divorce,  especially when it is not by your choice.   Anna Dunlap had to face this  challenge alone with a 4 year old daughter, Molly.  She decided to move on  with her life and try to love again.  This was a decision that she probably  regretted most in her ordeal, but she would have never known it could come  to her losing her child.  We all make decisions that we regret later,  without any forshadow, but then we have to learn to live with our choices.   Anna was naive about a few things in choosing her mate, Leo.  One, he had  no children of his own and two, she slept with him so soon after the first  date.  That to me was the foreshadow that things were not going to be  pretty.

I have to admit that in the beginning I was a  little miffed because all the characters seemed to perfect like Evander,  Betty, Jacqui and they rest.  However, as the story unfolded and I was  WAITING for Drew and Betty to meet, there personalities started to unfold  and created a free-flowing love story.  Granted, we never know where we are  going to meet the love of our life, Until shows us to always follow our gut  instincts.  Betty knew all along that Evander wasn't for her, but she  couldn't put her finger on it and tell why.  I also likedd reading about  people that weren't drop dead gorgeous or outright beautiful.  As usc80  said, these were 30-somethings corporate professionals looking for love.   Way to go Timmothy on your debut novel and I am ALWAYS looking forward to  reading the next one.	2000-08-08

It reads very easy, but isn't simple.  Zoe lead a very nice lifestyle and seemed to attract people of a different element, which  was kind of interesting.  There were times I wished Jason wasn't so sappy,  but that added to the storyline.  The &quot;affairs&quot; were tough and  rough, so I can see why Zane choose that route.  The book has sex, lies,  murder, intrigue, suspense and all that.  I liked the realistic details  about the book, then ending got a little far-fetched, but hey, people are  crazy this day and age and that could have happened!  You won't be  disappointed.

It wasn't one of the ususal boy meets girl and acts like a punk throughout the whole courtship to get her.  This book truly had DRAMA, but  there were points that were truly boring and didn't add any value to the  story line.  Vince and Dana had some genuine issues that people today are  dealing with, but there lives were to fairy-taleish.  Womack, Rosa Lee and  Hurricane didn't really distract from the story but they surely didn't make  it exciting either. I think what Rosa Lee had to say to Dana at the end  made the most sense of any of the advice Dana got in the whole book.  But  truly, Butter, Jefferson and Gerri didn't add much, just that everyone has  some secret in their lives that is waiting to burst out.  The book was  entertaining but it was a pure struggle to get through some parts.  What  ever happens to Claudio, that was just comedic!	2000-07-27

Another book about men chasing women and then finally realizing that his friends are moving on and therefore they need to get with the program.  Rodney Hampton was a typical man trying to get his life together after a monumental event reshapes his best friend's life.  I thought it was sad that his friend, Tim, had to get married before Rodney realized that he needed to get his life together and move on. I think it is even worse that he had to revisit old relationships to try and find a mate.  He was shallow as were the characters in the book.  No one was developed enough so that we could follow and feel for them. The three women on the list had worse problems than Rodney and that was sad!  I thought there were some extraneous characters in there that didn't need to be and they didn't enhance the story at all....	2000-07-21

The characters are people that we hope to meet in our lifetime.  I thought the book was have a few deeper issues such as interracial dating and the issue of she makes  more money than he.  It was fine not to include those topic matters to keep  the book light, but I think it would have made it a tad bit more  interesting.  I thought at times Myles Moore was a bit sappy in his  romantic overtures, but I think every woman wishes her man or the man that  she wants would have this in his heart and say it at one time or another.   I got a little sick at some of their play, but the lines were witty and  cute at the same time.  Marisa had some real issues.  I hope Elian Gonzalez  doesn't have the same issues when he gets older, because their adventures  to the states are very similar. Anyway, Mr. Major did a really good job on  his first novel and I hope I have the opportunity to read more!  Thanks  Marcus Major.	2000-07-14

Yes, she was  spoiled and yes she learned some valuable lessons about love,life and  friendship.  I think that it was ironic that when BabySister had a problem  or something was wrong, her father gave her food.  Well, when stuff started  going really bad, she quit her job and food was her saviour.  I am glad  that her father finally set her straight at the end, which he should have  done all along.  I am a true believer that God puts people in our lives for  a reason and the reason that Darren came into BabySister's life was to  teach her to grow up and that life ain't easy. Also, what goes around comes  around, you can't do dirt to someone and then not expect it not to come  around to you. BabySister definitely got hers! This book was well written,  it was entertaining and there wasn't a boring moment in the whole saga.   Renee did a good job and I can't wait to read more of her books.	2000-07-08

I didn't see why the book was about or intended to be about infidelity.  I understand the question to be &quot;when is it  cheating&quot;.  That was interesting how Jo and Daniel handled the  situation, but I felt that it had more to do with Eli and Dana and who done  it.  There were a lot of unnecessary strings attached to the book that made  it kind of confusing.  I really didn't see how the dogs, Jo's daughters,  Sara and John's relationship or some of the other extraneous stories  contributed to infideltity.  Needless to say, it was well written and it  was interesting, but it just had too many loopholes.  I found it even more  interesting that Daniel, the husband, was a minister and him having to deal  with infidelity.  He probably had to preach the subject matter to his  parishoners and never thought he would have to deal with it. Oh well, I  think Sue Miller is a good writer, this book just didn't do it for me.	2000-07-04

I read &quot;Do Right Man&quot; and I really did not like it, so when my bookclub chose this one I was not excited about reading it.  I have to admit that it caught my attention. About 10 years ago I could relate to  this book on my level, but now that I have children, I see where Tracy's  mother went wrong.  Omar was on the money with the music, trends and  fashions for the 80's!  However, from the beginning Tracy had too much  attitude and freedom.  Unfortunately she was a product of a single parent  family and that tends to cause more problems in itself.  The book kept my  attention and I routed for Tracy to see some the character for what they  were worth.  She finally caught on when she saw the demise of her friend,  Mercedes.  Sometimes it takes a shock to get us on the right track.   Anyway, this was a decent book and Omar Tyree did a good job writing this  book from a young girls perspective.  It is not easy for a man to see  things through the eyes of a young adolescent female. Hats off to you Mr.  Tyree.	2000-06-23

I am not a child of an interracial relationship, but I have had a curiosity about how they live  their lives.  Birdie/Jesse had a very difficult time growing up because she  had so many things to deal with as a maturing adolescent.  To be bi-racial,  to have to assume another identity, to have to live without your father and  sister, to have to pretend to of another religion, to have to lie about  your truest feelings and then lie about your ethnicity to everyone you meet  on top of becoming an adolescent must be the most difficult thing for a  young woman, especially in the 70's/early 80's.  I commend Danzy Senna for  writing this book, because I am sure there are a lot of young woman that  can identify with the subject matter.  The book got a little long winded at  times, but overall it was very well written and very enlightening.  Good  background (Boston, MA), good time period and good story.	2000-06-02

All this is  to say that I can relate to this book very well and Robert Morgan did an  excellent job writing it.  It was very easy to read and it was easy to  understand Julie.

I thought the book was really good and really real.  She didn't glorify the tale of every character and I respect her as an author for NOT doing that.   I think the only thing that could have been emphasized a little more for me  was the grief of Lena for the loss of her child.  It was evident that  Ryland grieved for the loss of Kenya and realized that he is just as much  responsible, but I didn't really see the grief process of Lena or Ma Adele.   Is this to say that women hide their emotions better than me or that we  deal with it better?  I don't think so, but that may be the case with these  characters.  Hats off to Marita Golden, and Ms. Golden if you read this we  would love to have you come discuss your novel at our book club in  Alexandria, VA!   Thanks.	2000-04-14

I was very eager to read this book because I read Ms. Sinclair's two previous books, so I started this one and put it down because I found something more interesting.  I picked it up again and realized that it  really was boring.  There were so many undealt with issues.  Dee Dee was  molested, she binged (an eating disorder), she needed to deal with her  divorce, her mother's denial of her relationship with her stepfather and  most of all the &quot;Bill&quot;.  What ever happened to Bill?  The sexual  harrasser at the beginning of the book.  What ever came of Jade and Yoshi?   There were a lot of situations brought up and never finished for the  reader.  The issue with Skylar and his daughter was rushed at the end and  none of the other situations were mentioned.  I think the best character  was Langston, the cat.	2000-03-14

I put this book to the side because I thought it was about just a beauty shop and I lost some interest.  It came with perfect timing.  I just got married and had a baby.  Each woman had a story that I could relate to  except Sandy.  I think Sandy had a lot issues that resulted from her  relationship with her mother and she should have been punished for what she  did.  She totally got away with murder (literally!).  However, I can relate  to Pat, Faye and Zuma, I have a wonderful marriage to a great man, I have a  child that I love more than anything and I want to have a child before I  turned 30.  Sheneska did a really good job with helping you to see the  emotion that each woman was feeling.  I felt for all the women and they had  real life issues.  This book should be read by every woman, because we all  can relate in some form or another and we all need to get our hair done!

When you look for the good in everyone, that is what you  will get.  Novalee met some people with some real issues and she found the  best in all of them.  She was very fortunate in her situation to give birth  to a baby in Wal-mart of all places and then come out finding the love of  her life, a place to live and call home, people that embraced her and she  matured throughout the entire process.  For someone who did not complete  the tenth grade, she sure was doing well for herself in seven years.  I  thought this book was very well done and hats off to Billie Letts.
