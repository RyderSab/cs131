If you think al Qaeda is bad news, let me introduce you to Imperial Japan, a xenophobic society of death-worshipping nationalist religious fanatics.  Leo Daugherty describes the Japanese soldier in 95 pages divided into six chapters:<br /><br />--martial tradition<br /><br />--induction and training<br /><br />--military organization<br /><br />--tactics<br /><br />--individual weapons and equipment<br /><br />--Japanese infantry division support weapons<br /><br />Want to know what motivated the Imperial Japanese soldier to hunker down in a spider hole clutching an unexploded American aircraft bomb and a hammer?  That soldier was going to blow up an American tank-and himself.  The Kamikaze came about when military defeat and lack of war material meshed with the duty of the Japanese soldier to die in battle-if necessary, by killing himself.  Daugherty wrote that the state religion of Shinto and the code of Bushido incorporated in 1867.  Emperor Hirohito was considered a god, and anything done in service to that god was good.  The national goal was unifying the world-under Japanese leadership.  The soldier's code, Senjinkun, was pounded into already-prepared recruits.  A military junta ruled Japan and this junta prepared the Japanese people for total war.  On page 21 a table lists the year-long conscript training cycle-but this wasn't the beginning of military training.  School children were indoctrinated early.  \\"By 1934, more than one-third, or 915,000, of Japan's young men in the appropriate age bracket studied and drilled at these youth training centers.\\"<br /><br />No wonder part of the Japanese Imperial Guards rebelled when Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's capitulation!<br /><br />Japan had no jungles to train in, yet the Japanese soldier was an excellent jungle fighter.  This was the result of long, thorough training.  The Japanese soldier was trained to fight at night as a means of overcoming enemy forces superior in numbers and firepower.  The bayonet and hand grenade were preferred over the rifle-especially for close combat in the dark.<br /><br />I found the descriptions of weapons and equipment brief but useful.  Many criticize the Japanese for having poor small arms, for lacking a submachine gun, for \\"over reliance\\" on the bayonet.  Actually, Japanese rifles and light machine guns were quite effective.  Japanese pistols weren't, and the Type 100 submachine gun was a failure.  The United States didn't really have a good submachine gun either, and its Browning Automatic Rifle was no match for a light machine gun.  The famed knee mortar provided close-in 50mm shellfire on enemy positions.  Oh, perhaps a semiautomatic rifle like America's M-1 Garand would have been nice-provided Japan's industry could keep her soldiers supplied with ammunition.  Unrestricted air and submarine warfare by the United States went a long way towards insuring that there was never enough ammunition for the Japanese defenders.<br /><br />At the division level (roughly 20,000 men-on paper), Japan shortchanged its soldiers on heavy weapons.  No matter-there was a decided lack of motor transport in the Japanese armed forces.  Couldn't haul artillery pieces and ammunition even if they had the hardware-a severe lack of petroleum was one reason Japan attacked the Western nations.  Against lightly-equipped Chinese formations, Japanese units had ample firepower.  When confronted by Soviet armored formations, Japan lost a chunk of Manchuria during 1939 in the Khalkyn Gol Incident.  Initially, Japan crushed more-heavily armed British Commonwealth and American troops, but by 1943 the shoe was on the other foot.  Eventually, islands such as Iwo Jima would bear the full brunt of American air power and naval gunfire unaided-it would just be the Japanese infantryman and a handful of artillery pieces buying time.  Like the Vietnamese Communists of 40 years ago and al Qaeda today, the Japanese soldier believed it was just a matter of time before the soft Americans gave up and crawled back home.  Given the disparity in divisional artillery and in tanks, this was quite the leap of faith!<br /><br />Japan declared war on the whole world and her infantrymen did more than humanly possible.  \\"Fighting Techniques of a Japanese Infantryman\\" describes in general terms how the Japanese infantry achieved this, and the tools that Japan gave its soldiers.r of time before the soft Americans gave up and crawled back home.

I was undecided about which soldier had a rougher life--the Japanese, Soviet, or Chinese soldier.  After reading Philip Jowett's \\"The Chinese Army,\\" I'll vote for the Chinese soldier.  One in four soldiers issued a blanket?  The virtual lack of a logistics pipeline severely hindered the Chinese Army's effectiveness.  What little trickled down to the soldier's unit was often stolen and sold by his officers.  No wonder Mao won!  China was in a state of civil war since the mid 1920's.  Japan needed resources and saw a failed nation as ripe for the picking.  After Japan exhausted itself in China, Japan declared war on the rest of the world and was utterly crushed--Chinese soldiers played an important role in that defeat.  Afterwards, China resumed its civil war, with the Communists routing the Nationalists.  That civil war continues today with the conflict over Taiwan.<br /><br />\\"The Chinese Army\\" covers the Nationalist Chinese Army--and I am abusing the term \\"army.\\"  Most of the Nationalist army was a half-trained peasant rabble that would have felt at home in the 100 Years War.  It astounds me that the Chinese managed to survive close to three decades of civil war--with nearly a third of that in a formal declared war against Japan.  I'll have to look up the other Chinese army, Mao's.<br /><br />Details on uniforms and equipment included a series of color plates that are worth the price of the book.  The details on unit organization are sketchy--but then, Chinese Army organization was flexible to the extreme.  This book is 48 pages long, a bit slimmer than other Osprey products--but then, the Chinese fought a \\"come as you are\\" war.  Virtually all weapons were either imports or copies of foreign weapons.  Uniforms ranged from ordinary peasent garb (and a sack for ammunition--the few cartridges available) to German-based uniforms for Chaing's personal divisions.<br /><br />I have to respect these tough soldiers.  The only thing harder than being a Chinese soldier was being a Chinese peasant.r was being a Chinese peasant.	2005-10-03

When the United States entered World War Two, the nation's movers and shakers wanted commando units on the British model and the military establishment considered such units a waste of resources.  Gordon L. Rottman covers this war between the two factions, the victory over the military during the war, and the rush to extinguish these units at the end of the war.  Special forces units in the PTO had uneven success--part of the problem was the same as using the untried air weapons or the submarine.<br /><br />Yet special forces units did achieve success all out of proportion to the resources expended on them.  The war in the Pacific changed radically from the dark days following Pearl Harbor to the day that the surrender was signed on the Missouri.  Special forces changed too.<br /><br />The charge that special operations units \\"cream off\\" quality people is brought up and proven--but the alternative of simply expending this \\"cream\\" along with the rest of the cannon fodder isn't addressed.  Special forces units could and did fill specific needs--Rottman pointed out that the long range reconnisance units were sorely missed during the Korean war and later rebuilt.  Today's special forces (Ranger, Green Beret, SEAL, Marine Recon) had their World War Two counterparts.  Rottman mentions that Marine Raider battalions have not been re-invented, though MEU (SOC) do have a platoon-sized special mission element.<br /><br />I will get a lot of use out of the detailed organizational charts and the thorough histories of each type of unit.  Navy frogmen were not covered in detail--I can live with that because little-known formantions are so well described.  Most Osprey books have several color plates in the center displaying uniforms and equipment.  This book has organizational charts and maps--a useful trade-off.  \\"US Special Warfare Units in the Pacific Theater\\" told me what communications equipment was used in each unit.  Individual and crew-served weapons were listed.  Means of transport into and out of the operational zone, and what means were used in the Area of Operations, are covered because they limited unit size and firepower.<br /><br />This book sheds light on little-known special warfare units used in the Pacific War.ns equipment was used in each unit.

Gordon L. Rottman didn't disappoint.  He describes squad and platoon organization, individual clothing and equipment, and follows a fictional soldier through his career.  Most readers will find the Imperial Japanese soldier alien--because they expect the product of early 20th-Century Japan to think, feel, and act just like themselves.  Let go of prejudice and it will be easier to see what life was like for a son of Nippon.<br /><br />To be crudely blunt, life was Hell for the Imperial Japanese soldier.  Japan was too poverty-stricken to support her soldiers in the field.  The Japanese war machine took over the nation and bogged it down in a land war that made America's Vietnamese nightmare seem gentle.  Don't forget--the utter fanaticism of the Japanese soldier led to Harry Truman dropping two atomic bombs on Japanese cities so that American soldiers and sailors and Marines wouldn't have to die storming the home islands.  Death, and the promise of a Japanese Vahalla, must have been a blessed relief from disease, starvation, and boredom--and the terror of pre-invasion bombardment by the American Navy.<br /><br />I really liked the detail on the light machine gun team and its equipment.  Apparently, only four 30-round magazines were issued for the Type 96 and Type 99 light machine guns--and between 450 and 750 rounds of ammunition.  The flexible nature of Japanese small unit organization was well presented.  For a 64-page book targeting an English-speaking audience, this book is an excellent reference on the life and equipment of the lowest level of the Japanese military machine.	2005-10-03

Massad Ayoob explains the difference in Chapter 24, and writes that \\"Stressfire II\\" is a book of technique-not tactics.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to read this book when it first came out in 1992.  One concept that hit me in the face was that the shotgun was \\"heavy artillery.\\"  I have a military background and I had to shift mental gears; the heaviest police weapons are the lightest military weapons.  Shotguns are devastating on unarmored personnel in the open at short (hand grenade) ranges.  Between pages 15 and 30, Ayoob provides a series of photographs showing what the shotgun does to human bodies and 7-yard shot patterns.  The problems of shotgun retention when the bad guys try to take your gun away are addressed.  Shotguns are more prone to malfunctions than the military rifles and pistols I deal with-the recommended \\"immediate action drill\\" for a jammed shotgun is dropping the gun and pulling your pistol.  It won't always be an option-many people have only a shotgun, no handguns!  In that case, the hand-to-hand combat techniques (using the shotgun as an impact weapon) may come in handy; they're based on military bayonet fighting techniques.  In my experience, the two most-common shotgun malfunctions are short-stroking the pump gun and failing to pick up a shell from the magazine (fixed by pumping it again) and running the magazine dry (reloading fixes that).  Sometimes the shot shells just hang up-which takes a few minutes to fix.  Ayoob's recommendation to use a secondary weapon-even if that's simply using your shotgun as a club-makes sense in the split-second world of hand-to-hand combat.  \\"Stressfire II\\" also has tips on using cover (protection from bullets) and managing the shotgun's stiff recoil.  On the latter, Ayoob recommends the 20 gauge autoloading shotgun-or the then-new low-recoil \\"tactical buckshot.\\"<br /><br />The equipment recommendations are still valid, even if some of the guns Ayoob mentions are only available second-hand, on the used gun rack.  One thing that wasn't available when this book was written was an efficient white light mount for the shotgun.  The gun-mounted light is for target identification and to dazzle the target-I'm sure that Ayoob teaches proper management of the shotgun-mounted light in his shooting school.  \\"Stressfire II\\" is a textbook on techniques and equipment.  I recommend going to a shooting school-but read the textbook first and know your equipment before going.  Your school should teach both technique and tactics.  \\"Stressfire II\\" can help you choose your school by showing you what techniques work and what doesn't.even if some of the guns Ayoob mentions are only available second-hand, on the used gun rack.

I liked David Cordingly's \\"Under the Black Flag: the Romance and the Reality of  Life Among the Pirates.\\"  The sea terms glossary was useful: I didn't know that \\"pink\\" and \\"snow\\" were types of sailing ships.  I like my books to have a bibliography, a table of contents, a list of illustrations, and be indexed so that I can find citations rapidly-Cordingly also put in four appendixes, documents supporting his thesis.<br /><br />Pirates have been around since before recorded history.  Pirates prey on society-they cannot exist without prey.  Pirates are still active today-especially in the Far East.  Cordingly mentions them (publication date is 1995)-my personal experience is that pirates are still a problem for security professionals.<br /><br />\\"Under the Black Flag\\" explores both fact and fiction.  The romantic image is examined through books, plays, and movies.  Captain Hook from \\"Peter Pan\\" and Long John Silver from \\"Treasure Island\\" are said to be the two most famous pirates.<br /><br />The historical pirates included the Chinese pirate queen Cheng Shih, Molly Read, Anne Bonny, Henry Morgan, Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and Sir Frances Drake-to name the most notorious and famous.  Some, such as Drake, became national heroes and were made legitimate.  Others, such as Captain Kidd, were railroaded.  The  Blackbeards earned every bit of notoriety.<br /><br />How did the pirates live-and die?  My \\"day job\\" is working as a supply technician for the Nevada Army National Guard, and while on active duty I was an Army intelligence analyst-so details on how the pirate ships were kept in good repair and provisioned were right up my alley.  Most pirate loot was hardware, food, sail cloth, and other such items that kept their ship afloat and their crews alive (if not healthy).  As with pirates and terrorists and other criminals today, pirates survived because there was no concerted effort to eradicate them, because corrupt public officials and governments nurtured them, and because it wasn't really worthwhile for the large commercial corporations to pull the plug.  \\"Under the Black Flag\\" does record instances where piracy suppression operations occurred, and Cordingly expresses surprise at how rapidly the pirate menace abated.  No mystery to me-pirates live a precarious existence.  Any number of things can go wrong.  Pirates are never a match for a real navy-because navies do not have to subsist off of plunder.  Cordingly records that in 1720 there were perhaps 2000 active pirates (a guess-pirates didn't submit to a credible and official census).  Total pirate ships was low, with an average of 80 pirates per crew-so there were about two dozen pirate ships.  The year 1720 was a peak of pirate activity.  When the Royal Navy dispatched a dozen or so warships specifically for pirate suppression, issued amnesty to those who would give up piracy, closed pirate havens, organized merchant convoys, placed bounties on captured pirates, cracked down on corrupt government officials who supported piracy, and cleaned up the privateer system, the pirate menace all but vanished within a few short years.<br /><br />Pirates were cruel and savage-they were \\"macho men\\" in many ways.  Life in the Royal Navy was rough-but I was surprised to learn that life as a merchant seaman was worse.  I didn't know it could get worse!  For example, \\"Under the Black Flag\\" reports that the white crews of slave ships suffered the same rate of fatalities as their black human cargo.  Merchant crews have always been small due to the desire to maximize profits by having low overheard-a pirate crew may have been 80 men, the same size merchant ship would have had perhaps a dozen in the crew.  Wooden sailing ships are labor-intensive.  In port, as with today's over-the-road trucker, the ships would be loaded and unloaded by dock hands.  At sea, the small crew would be doing everything.  If something went wrong (pirate attack, bad weather, accidents), the small crew would be overwhelmed.  John Harrison's chronometer and lunar distance tables were developed in the middle of the 18th Century (page 82 & 83): until then, seamen could never be sure where they were in the east-west direction (longitude)-errors of 600 miles or more were common for poor navigators.  Latitude calculations were usually within 5 or 10 miles-the view from the crows nest of those tall ships would be able to spot land at that distance, so navigators would pick a line of latitude and sail along that line.  Or, they'd follow the coast.  These navigational shortcomings played into the hands of the pirates, who had only to wait along `shipping routes' for fat merchant ships.  Eventually, naval vessels began aggressively patrolling these routes, making life more difficult.  Pirate ships had to be self-sufficient.  Ports and shipyards were often closed to them.  Pirate ships were basically modified merchant vessels-few pirate ships were purpose-built or started life as a warship.  Ordinary merchant seaman life was so terrible that many turned pirate.  Many were also drafted when their merchant ship fell victim to pirates-or so it was claimed at pirate trials.  Deserters from the Royal Navy and escaped slaves became pirates.  Due to lack of a national government and the need for leadership performance, pirate captains ruled at the whim of their crews.<br /><br />I liked this book.

Most of these pages are either illustrated by Ron Volstad or have photographs--many of the photos are from that period.<br /><br />I learned a lot from this little book.  I used to think that the three-cell Mauser rifle pouches held 45 rounds in 9 chargers--Rottman wrote that the M1909 cartridge pouch did, but had been replaced by the M1911.  The latter held just 2 clips (Mauser magazine chargers) of 5 rounds each for a total of 30 rounds.  A rifleman usually was issued a pair of pouches and carried 60 rounds.  The G43-armed rifleman replaced one set of pouches with a two-pocket magazine carrier--with three 10-shot magazines and a M1911 cartridge pouch, the G43 rifleman had the same amount of ammunition as his Kar98k-armed brother.  This makes a difference to war gamers, re-enactors, and museums.<br /><br />What was carried in the bread bag?  Was the mess kit/cook pot carried empty or full of food?  When did the WWI spade get replaced by the folding entrenching tool?  What equipment did a machine gunner carry?

Nazi Germany's fortunes changed radically during the course of World War Two.  Far from being the motorized army of conventional wisdom, most German soldiers were moved to the front by train, then tactically moved on foot.  During the early days of World War Two, the small fraction that was motorized and armored managed great feats--the rest of the German army consolidated gains using field fortifications.  At the end of the war, Germany had run out of everything but the enemy--they had no artillery, no ammunition, few soldiers, insufficient small arms, no food, no fuel, and their most reliable transportation was the bicycle (horses were eaten).  By 1945, German had essentially no mobile striking force and no air force.  \\"German Field Fortifications\\" shows the measures used to stabilize the fronts on all theaters and in varied terrain.<br /><br />I liked seeing the differences between the Russian Front and North African field fortifications.

I first read about this book in a \\"true crime\\" magazine during 1992, but it was a few years before I could obtain a copy--I started working in the Middle East in 1994 and it was a bit hard keeping up with the latest books at the time.  Yup!  Instant gratification takes too long!<br /><br />David Koenig's book answered a lot of my questions about what working at Disneyland was like--he also raised more questions about \\"The Happiest Place On Earth.\\"  I've never been more than a guest at Disneyland: a few friends, a nephew and my sister-in-law worked there.  This is a history book--so I wasn't expecting 1997 ticket prices.  I'm unsure when my 15th printing was published.  A treat was the foreward by Art Linkletter, one of the television hosts who broadcast the opening day show on 17 July 1955.  I had no idea that there had been labor strikes at Disneyland--I didn't know about the Yippie riot that closed the park on 6 August 1970.  The many law suits that \\"Mouse Tales\\" chronicles shows that Disneyland is an American icon--people sue Disneyland in order to sue America?  Was this what Walt had in mind when he designed the place as a playground--and as a force for social change?<br /><br />News media people have a negative world view--they claim it is the only way they stay in business.  Koenig didn't pull any punches on the negative, yet he managed to paint Disneyland in a positive light.  Or it could be that I'm simply obsessed with the place.  Isn't \\"obsession\\" having a longer attention span than the person who labels you \\"obsessed?\\" The feeling of belonging among Disneyland cast members is stronger than in most of corporate America--nearly as strong as in military units, and stronger than the bond felt by most students for their high school or college class.  Part of this is that Walt's spirit still guides--the cast at Disneyland makes every effort to promote the Disney experience for the guests.  The major reason for disappointment at Disneyland is that the guest expected to \\"do it all\\" and is overwhelmed by the selection of attractions (over 60!)--impossible to do in a single day.  I took a friend to Disneyland for Columbus Day, 2002, and we logged 48 attractions, rides, shows, plus both Fantasmic! and the parade--it was a long day, I knew the park well, and severe California wildfires left a pall of smoke that blotted out the sun and kept attendance low.

Training is synthetic experience.  This fake experience is valuable because greater feedback is possible, telling me exactly what happened in the clinical training session.  This \\"play \\" is inexpensive compared to the real thing-nobody is supposed to really die or become crippled, and the safety rules prevent criminal and civil charges when followed.  Training is great stuff because training can focus in on a specific aspect of life, an aspect that happens too rarely to otherwise gain enough real-world experience, such as exchanging gunfire with an armed opponent, and the trainee can experience handling this situation successfully.  Training is great-but it is phony!<br /><br />Ralph Mroz points this out in different words.  His \\"Defensive Shooting for Real-Life Encounters\\" is not a recipe book of handgun techniques, but a yardstick to measure a training program.  This book may go over the head of the casual shooter, someone who is seeking only the minimum training required for professional certification (a majority of our professional police) and most of the private citizens who carry concealed handguns for self-protection.  These casual shooters' needs don't include self-criticism and introspection-they have a specific goal and just want a cheap, simple way to reach the goal.  Mroz is also certain to alienate many because he reminds us that not only is training NOT \\"real-life,\\" but that it cannot be.  As many gun people have invested thousands of dollars and years gaining measurable skills that they can perform upon demand-on a structured shooting range-being told that their skills are not always the right answer is going to hurt their feelings.  Mroz states that most self-defense shootings happen at hand-to-hand combat distances; on page 63 he wrote that 54% of gunfights happen at 5 feet or less and 74% happen at less than 10 feet.  Then he turns around and states in the footnote that some of the shooting data is based upon self-reports and may not be entirely truthful or accurate.<br /><br />For the serious (obsessed?) student of the gun, \\"Defensive Shooting for Real-Life Encounters\\" is a gold mine.  Miners know that a lot of gravel has to be moved to get a handful of nuggets.  This book's information can't really be used directly as a training blueprint or a performance yardstick.  The 74% of gunfights at 10 feet or less figure I quoted above doesn't take into account the dynamics of a lethal force encounter-that the participants don't just stand at a set distance from each other, but they move, sometimes several miles at high speeds.  Ever hear of a freeway shootout between two speeding cars?  Mroz writes of gun-FIGHTING rather than shooting because often, at these close distances, the defender has no chance to use his gun and has to rely on running or empty-hand techniques to create enough space.  Mroz doesn't call the skills imparted by intense competitive shooting useless.  Instead, he points out that the performance envelope for those skilled at these games is limited and that real-life lethal-force encounters take place outside of this envelope.  Here's and example: virtually no shooting schools permit their student shooters to shoot at moving targets or targets closer than 9 feet-in real-life encounters, most \\"targets\\" move (and move AT the shooter with deadly intent, else shooting isn't justified) and there's that 74% of shooting incidents taking place at less than 10 feet figure again.<br /><br />On Page 51, the chapter that includes point shooting is worth the price of the book.  I was introduced to point shooting by Rex Applegate's \\"Kill or Get Killed\\" and I learned to shoot by using a cheap BB gun.  When I read the controversy about point shooting versus \\"aimed fire,\\" I was mildly amused.  Mroz not only settles the issue (use both, depending upon the situation), but he details the strengths and weaknesses of both, discusses the psychological and physiological factors involved, and then in his examination of police departments who successfully use point shooting instruction to better their street shooting results, reveals the real secret of success: lots of realistic practice.  If you train to a performance standard that is related to real-world incidents, you are better prepared for those incidents.<br /><br />Mroz covers subjects including shoes and eyeglasses.  How much detail can you get from 148 pages, anyway?  This book is a primer on THINKING.  One thing which can upset readers is that many of us buy a book to get the answer to questions such as \\"what is the meaning of life?\\"  Since real life isn't a fully-instrumented laboratory, there are going to be a lot of unknowns.  If you don't know the questions, how are you going to find the answers?  \\"Defensive Shooting for Real-Life Encounters\\" is a series of questions that I'm going to use to re-examine my own training programs.  Besides, in my case Mroz validated much of what I've been doing for years.  For example, due to safety concerns and feedback issues I use Air Soft \\"toy guns\\" for close-quarter shooting exercises.  I also insist upon referees for force-on-force training, and when I can, I videotape training.

US	48667725	R2V2XFD7F0O2CB	0936279036	430414861	001: Stressfire, Vol. 1 (Gunfighting for Police: Advanced Tactics and Techniques)	Books	5	20	24	N	N	A complete firearms course	I was lucky enough to get Stressfire when it first appeared.  Ayoob put together a nifty little manual that provides most of the \\"how to\\" needed to become an effective pistol shot.  Much of the current FM 23-35, the Army's manual on pistol shooting, is so close that I wonder if the Army copied Stressfire.  I'd recommend getting this book along with \\"The Truth About Self Protection\\" if you have a gun for self defense, or are considering that option.  You'll still need to review your state and local laws, consult with an attorney, and if you want a concealed firearms permit you must get a training certificate from a licensed firearms instructor, but reading both Ayoob books (this one and \\"The Truth About Self Protection\\") and your handgun's owner's manual and getting familiar with your chosen handgun before class starts will ensure that you get your money's worth from the instructor.  It takes about 60 hours of training to turn someone with zero firearms experience into an acceptable handgun shooter--and some of that training must be under \\"operational conditions.\\"  Training is synthetic experience--structured, inexpensive, and geared for learning.  \\"Stressfire\\" covers the three basics of firearms safety--muzzle control, trigger control, ammunition management.  This same triangle is the basis for gunfighting--if your gun isn't loaded and the bullet exit port properly lined up with your target when you mash the trigger, you won't adequately impress your attacker--he won't stop his deadly and unavoidable assault upon you.  \\"Stressfire\\" tells you how to do it.	2005-08-18

More specifically, my own ignorance can get me killed.  Massad Ayoob's \\"The Truth About Self Protection\\" helped me dispell some of my ignorance.  This book was written more than two decades ago, and even back then it wasn't 100% accurate on the laws in every location worldwide--so check on these laws yourself.  There is only one rule in self defense: SURVIVE.  Ayoob helps with all aspects of surviving a self defense incident: pre-incident (avoiding the situation is nice when you can manage it), the actual attack, and the mental, physical, and legal nightmares afterwards.<br /><br />I liked the coverage of empty-hand and \\"less lethal\\" weaponry--and expedient weapons.  Most of the time, you are prohibited from possessing loaded firearms.  I travel a lot on business, and some of the world's garden spots are dangerous!  Okay, sometimes my employer will issue me a machine gun and 800 rounds of belted ammunition, but that's an exceptional circumstance.  Ayoob detailed options other than a trusty .45 in a shoulder holster.<br /><br />Newton's Law applies to self defense, too.  Every action produces reaction.  \\"The Truth About Self Protection\\" talks about the reaction from the media and the legal system when you use force.  News media exists to entertain--and while you are being entertained, you get bombarded by advertising.  Ayoob's advice, \\"don't talk to the press,\\" is about as good as it gets without your own professional spin doctor to manage your media exposure.  Expect to be arrested when you clobber someone who tried to kill you, even if you are unarmed and your attacker had an automatic weapon.  Institutionally, the law enforcement agencies are geared towards arrest and gathering evidence.  It is their job to get you to make damaging admissions that will result in your conviction.  Besides, the police don't know what happened--the criminal will usually not commit his crime with police around because he will be caught.  Law enforcement officers deal with criminals, politicians, members of the media, legal system professionals, and other people who lie, cheat and steal for a living.  Ayoob tells you what to say, and how to say it--more importantly, you are advised to say as little as possible and talk mostly with the people in your corner--your defense attorney.  Many people are emotionally devastated when they are involved in a confrontation--especially when they had to kill in order to survive.  The primary factor in emotional devastation is failure to prepare in advance.  Ayoob provides some of that preparation and advises seeking professional help to deal with the post-incident trauma.<br /><br />Buy a copy of \\"The Truth About Self Protection.\\"  It is cheap.  Read it.  The time you spend reading this book is less than the time you'll spend in the hospital and in prison when you get vitimized by an uncaring world.  You cannot rely on others to protect you--you have to take responsibility for your own safety.  After you have digested the lessons in Ayoob's book, you have a good foundation to build on.  Some people cannot or will not use firearms.  Good for them!  \\"The Truth About Self Protection\\" is a start for learning to avoid becoming a crime victim in the first place.  You can also learn enough about non-gun defensive tools to recognize the phoney security toys being vended to the ignorant and helpless. \\"The Truth About Self Protection\\" will not make you an expert gunman--you will need to get other training--but it will give you a yardstick to measure that additional training.

Though written decades ago, the major subject of this book, mental conditioning, hasn't changed.  Jeff Cooper revised this book, and other than adding a few stories, couldn't improve it.<br /><br />The basics of alertness, decisiveness, aggressiveness, speed, coolness, ruthlessness, and surprise are detailed concisely.  Don't let the book's brevity fool you.  Jeff Cooper popularized the alertness color code--levels of AWARENESS and READINESS TO ACT.  If more automobile drivers drove in Condition Yellow, we'd have fewer traffic accidents.<br /><br />I even recommend these principles to my pacifist friends.  Decisiveness is selecting a course of action in advance of the emergency and then doing it when hell breaks loose.  A pacifist need not be passive--running away is my first choice when attacked, too.  Ruthlessness in running away means ruthlessly discarding excess baggage--drop everything!  An aggressive pacifist?  Sometimes the only escape route is through the attacker.  Besides, usually escape routes may be across \\"forbidden\\" private property--and screaming for help may be considered aggressive.  Jeff Cooper meant for these principles to be applied to the attacker--\\"anyone who choses physically to attack another human being does so at his peril.\\"  These simple principles are universal.<br /><br />By the way, most criminals chose helpless victims.  It is always a surprise when the victim resists.  It is a bigger surprise when the victim's resistance overwhelms the criminal.  I've been lucky so far.  I avoid trouble when I see it, and my apparent alertness labels me \\"not food\\" to society's predators.  \\"The Principles of Personal Defense\\" can do the same for you.	2005-08-18

I have to disagree with Ellen Snortland's statement that there are no rules in self defense.  There's one, and she mentions it: SURVIVE!  Survive physically.  Survive mentally.  Survive spiritually.  Survive socially.  In \\"Beauty Bites Beast,\\" the author justifies a woman's self defense and outlines resources and techniques.<br /><br />I had several heroines during the 1960's--Joan of Arc, Dale Evans, Mrs. Emma Peel, and Agent 99 were strong women who more than held their own with men.  One was an actual historical figure!  Ellen Snortland had no heroic female role models when she was growing up?<br /><br />On page 151, the author wrote about an unconscious fear of women would subject men to the same cruelty that women have been given--with me, it's not an unconscious fear.  I am very much aware that \\"plumbing\\" (the genitals) does not make one wise or \\"fair\\" -- I have already suffered injustice from women in positions of power over me.  Nothing like Joan of Arc, of course, but enough to demand checks and balances on all power.  \\"Trust me\\" sets off alarm bells.<br /><br />You have to take charge of your own personal safety.  Often, the power structure will prohibit self defense measures.  In England, resisting criminal assault or running from an attacker is a crime that can result in serious jail time for \\"endangering the public.\\"  Mexico does not recognize the right of self defense. In practice, this means the powerless people (includes most women) are disarmed by law, but those with political power and great wealth get to do anything without fear of punishment.  Until September 11, 2001, interfering with a skyjacker was a serious federal crime in the United States--a flaw exploited by Al Qaeda.<br /><br />I applaud programs such as IMPACT and KIDPOWER.  Training starts with baby steps (just say \\"no\\" like you mean it!) and progresses to full-power contact against a live (padded) aggressor.  It is important to produce winners from these programs--criminals \\"interview\\" potential victims.  \\"Are you helpless?  Are you my next meal?\\"  Overcoming opposition breeds confidence--this has to be earned, but trainers that \\"kill\\" their students in training only train them to die.  IMPACT seems to be a full force spectrum, covering everything from bearing, to verbal exchanges and body language, to the grim knock-down and stomp-stomp-stomp of hand to hand combat.  I wish I had KIDPOWER training anytime between 1963 and 1975--but boys of that era \\"didn't need protecting.\\"  I wasn't allowed to fight at all, and when I asked for protection against bullies or worse, I was punished for lying.  As soon as I received my high school diploma, I went someplace safer--Marine Corps boot camp.  There, Vietnam veterans taught me how, when, where, who, what, and why I would fight.

I remember a lot of this equipment from my childhood (I was an Air Force brat and was with my father in Europe during the early 1960's) and some of the World War Two equipment is still in service with today's US Army.  One example, the RL-39 on page 147 hasn't been improved upon.  The vintage canteen cup is still current issue--with a new \\"National Stock Number\\" instead of the WWII \\"Stock Number.\\"  The Browning .50 caliber heavy machine gun, despite many attempted replacements, still soldiers on in Iraq.  Most of the items pictured are now memories, though.  Mr. Enjames has assembled a fine collection between the covers of this book.<br /><br />In \\"real\\" museums, there are often glitches, errors, and substitutions in the displays.  One World War One trench scene was littered with modern 7.62mm NATO brass (adopted by the US Army in 1956, but experimentally available earlier) instead of the correct 8mm Lebel shell casings--the museum was working with limited resources and couldn't get a bucket full of the French brass for the diarama of an American doughboy in action during 1918.  Mr. Enjames appears to have used only vintage stuff in his photos.  Many of the smaller, \\"common\\" items such as the K-rations, C-rations, pamplets, hand tools, communications equipment, sewing and toilet kit contents, and chemical warfare gear won't be found in most museums.<br /><br />I will be using this book as reference when constructing minature World War Two dioramas.

Numbers can be used to describe something that happened, something that SHOULD have happened, or something that could happen--but these numbers are only as good as your assumptions.<br /><br />The success of the theme park industry and its affect on urban planning, the shopping mall, and zoos, museums and other \\"public spaces\\" show that most of the assumptions underlying Disneyland and the number crunching done by Buzz Price and his minions were valid.<br /><br />But \\"Walt's Revolution!: By The Numbers\\" is only partially about theme park math and Disneyland.  It is the story of Harrison Alan Price and the companies he worked for and started.  Buzz writes about six \\"waves\\" of development sparked by Disneyland.  This isn't the end of those effects--\\"WAVE SIX\\" is the effects on the gambling industry, something of importance to us Nevada residents because it keeps our taxes low and our state government solvent.  Oh, \\"Walt's Revolution!\\" has pages of numbers--they seemed more like the pages of photos to me, eye candy.  Not that the math had any flaws I could see (other than the possibility that the wrong numbers were displayed--you have to watch your base assumptions!), but this book is more a text on creative mind set than a manual on statistical analysis.<br /><br />\\"Walt's Revolution!\\" is both history and \\"how to\\"--yet I didn't find it boring to read.

Dr. Bull examines both the theory and practice of British, German, and American armies in Western Europe between 1939 and 1945.  Don't look in here for the latest and greatest cutting-edge infantry tactics--Stephen Bull wrote about what happened in the past.  That's history, folks!  A battallion commander would need about a decade of military education and experience to apply the lessons in this thin little book.<br /><br />Line and block charts dipict the organization of line infantry battalions--one from the three countries.  Germany seemed to have a battalion for every purpose, so the charts are a bit generic--but give a clear picture of the parts if a battalion.  Dr. Bull shows how the different parts worked together through text and pictures.  The color plates on pages 33-40 are easy to understand.  Showing how the British and Germans conducted urban warfare is valuable to understanding why American infantry doctrine until Iraq was to stay out of cities--and blast the cities into rubble.  City fighting can be more costly than taking down a fortified enemy postion.  Dr. Bull didn't mention non-combatant civilians or guerrilla activity--but neither did US Army doctrine of the period, at least not for the line infantry battalion commander.  Bull did cover machine guns, mortars, anti-tank techniques, land mines and booby traps, mototized and \\"armored\\" infantry, and tank-infantry cooperation in detail.  World War Two combat was combined arms--the infantry was never alone (though the World War Two infantry veterans I spoke to swear they were the Army's step children).<br /><br />\\"World War II Infantry Tactics\\" spotlighted that German, British, and American infantry tactics were surprisingly similar.  Surprising, perhaps, to someone who didn't consider that humans were conducting the same sort of activities over the same terrain with similar hardware--but there were significant differences between the three nations.  At the basic squad eqipment level, the Germans had a belt fed light machine gun and severl 5-shot bolt action rifles and one or two submachine guns, the British BREN gun fed from a \\"30-shot\\" box mangazine and was teamed up with several 10-shot bolt action rifles and a submachine gun or two, and the Americans had one or two Browning Automatic Rifles (20-shot magazine) and bunches of the 8-shot semiautomatic Garand M1 rifle (and occassionally .45 caliber submachine guns and semiautomatic M1 carbines).  The basic \\"fire volume\\" was about the same, even though the American Browning Automatic Rifle didn't have a quick-change barrel like the other two squad automatic weapons.  America got into the war about the time that the anti-tank rifle was being retired for being ineffective against tanks, and American infantry generally had the workable 2.36-inch rocket launcher (AKA \\"Bazooka\\") and the M9 and M9A1 anti-tank rifle grenade when they began seeing large-scale combat, so they didn't have to have the elaborate anti-tank teams that the British and Germans were forced to cobble together with improvised anti-tank weapons.  Fighting a tank while armed with just a crowbar--so that your buddy with a can of \\"petrol\\" can heave it atop the engine deck of an enemy tank so that a third man can puncture the can with rifle fire and a fourth can ignite the flammable fuel with a hand grenade or perhaps a bundle of smoldering rags is different from waiting until the enemy tank passes by your Bazooka position until you can get a flank or rear shot!  The early-war infantry 37mm anti-tank guns were not very effective on late-war light tanks--and just about everybody had medium tanks in service during 1942.<br /><br />\\"World War II Infantry Tactics: Company And Battalion\\" is concise and compact.

Want to turn your GI Joe into a museum piece?  The Fort Lewis (Washington state) Military Museum has many 12-inch figures on display to represent soldiers of different eras.  \\"Second World War And 12-Inch Action Figures\\" is a how-to guide on turning 1:6th-scale action figures from Dragon, 21st Century, and Blue Box Toys into museum minatures.  I have a minor complaint about the American soldier shown on pages 64 and 65--the sling on his M1903 Springfield rifle is attached to the stacking swivel instead of the forward sling swivel.  I can't gripe much--the original GI Joe made the same mistake with the M1 rifle!  Another minor glich is calling a 75mm recoiless rifle (page 4) a 57mm recoiless rifle.  Even so, the advice on modelling tools and techniques and the photos and descriptions of the finished figures made for an entertaining read.  I may even be able to use some of these techniques.	2005-07-13

Focus on the sights psychologically removes the shooter from the gun fight and can increase accuracy--but the human eye can focus on only one thing at a time.  Fratricide (shooting brother police officers) is one of the pitfalls of using your sights.  You need target focus if you are to identify your target--and know what your target is doing at the moment you shot.  Sight focus is important beyond 25 feet--this varies between people--and target focus is vital at ten feet or less.  Most gunfights take place at close range because criminal activity is an anti-social social activity.  The book, \\"Body Language\\" explains the distances for social interaction and how you can fool almost anybody at 25 feet, but have a lot of trouble doing so at 4 feet.  Most of the police officers who died from bullet injuries in the line of duty were shot from distances of less than ten feet--often, by other police officers.  Memorizing the grooves in your front sight instead of looking for body language clues when your enemy is close enough to touch is losing situational awareness--you'd have shot already if your target was doing something that justified shooting!  The uncertain nature of close quarter encounters is why point shooting must be part of the skill set possessed by every soldier, law enforcement officer, and armed private citizen.  Today's handguns have better sights--so low light, stress-induced visual impairment, and the effects of getting a face full of tear gas don't have the same effect as when armed with a M1911A1 issued in 1942.  Point shooting is quick to learn, and point shooting skills don't decay as rapidly as using the sights.<br /><br />It's a choice between target focus and front sight focus.  Up close--target focus.  At a distance--front sight focus.<br /><br />Applegate's choice of the Glock automatic may surprise some--he chose that pistol for its grip angle and reliable functioning.  Many ranges won't permit the use of Vector \\"low temperature tracer\\" ammunition because of a perceived fire hazard--in some areas, all tracer ammunition is prohibited.  I don't recall Applegate recommending the use of AirSoft guns (with their low-velocity brightly colored plastic projectiles), but the projectile can be observed and corrections made in grip and trigger control when tracers are impractical.<br /><br />Fairbairn and Sykes taught Applegate to fire \\"bursts\\" in order to make up for the low power of pistol bullets.  The two British police officers were using the .45 automatic with full metal jacketed bullets fighting crime in Shanghai about 80 years ago.  Applegate developed the two-shot burst as a fire discipline tool--there's a tendancy to shoot only one time and gape when the target doesn't fall down.  There's another problem brought on by \\"cold ranges\\" (guns only loaded for a firing string, then loaded and cleared upon command) -- the trainee is trained to empty the magazine each time a target is presented.  This creates two problems: fifteen or sixteen bullets go down range in a gun fight regardless of what the target does (the law enforcement officer is concentrating on keeping front sight on target blur) and the shooter now has an empty gun.<br /><br />Point shooting isn't a cure-all.  Point shooting is an effective answer to a limited tactical problem.  Ignoring point shooting just because you cannot hit a six-inch bull's eye at 500 feet with the technique ignores the fact than most deadly force encounters are within 10 feet and totally ignores the human factors.<br /><br />\\"Bullseyes Don't Shoot Back\\" is an excellent primer for point shooting.

For most Disneyland guests, the nuts-and-bolts details behind the many attractions will ruin their illusions.  Most people who are shown the tricks behind stage magic cannot get over feeling cheated.  If you had to watch the process of making sausages from birth of the meat animal (pig or whatever) to the grilling of your breakfast in the restaurant kitchen, odds are that you'd enjoy your oatmeal instead.<br /><br />But I enjoy seeing projects grow from project to fruition. John Hench's \\"Designing Disney: Imagineering and the Art of the Show\\" in an insiders peek at the Disney theme parks and cruise line.  Concept art is directed at a specific audience.  Usually the task for concept art is to sell the idea to the \\"suits\\"--who are a very different audience than Disneyland guests.  It's been said that executives consider everyone else subhuman--especially their customers and subordinate employees--so what \\"sells\\" a concept to a panel of executives will leave the end customer unimpressed.  Once the project gets the go-ahead, changes will happen.  \\"No plan survives contact with reality!\\"  At Disneyland, \\"finished attractions\\" will continually be changed due to economics or guest feedback until the attraction is replaced.  The Disneyland Monorail is a fine example of this.  On pages 26 and 27 and on page 33 monorail concept art differs significantly from today's Disneyland Monorail.  John Hench wrote about how this occurred.<br /><br />Many ideas don't make it to the concept stage.  Disenyland was very much the experimental community during the 1950's and 1960's.  The Enchanted Tiki Room was originally conceived of as a dinner show.  Around 1960, the South Pacific was considered romantic and adventurous.  Today, the Enchanted Tiki Room is considered ho-hum boring by most--but just try to rid Disneyland of it!  My visits to Disneyland are incomplete if I cannot see the Tiki Birds at least once!<br /><br />Hench wrote about the central theme of the park attractions, how \\"show\\" was the focus.  Some of the rides and attractions at Disneyland (Disney's California Adventure is a worse offender) are just rides or exhibits.  They have little if any tie-in, no synergy, with the rest of the park.  Walt Disney told stories with his park attractions.  The \\"nuts and bolts\\" of telling stories with a walk-in theater and live actors is explained in simple terms.  No math!  Imagine equations for the curve radii and bank on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad!  Color, character, form, space, and time are some of the elements used to tell the story.<br /><br />I like the panaramic photos of Main Street, Disneyland on pages 68 through 71.  Disney theme parks keep changing.  I like to see how the park has changed over time.  Hench explained why these changes occured.<br /><br />This book is a nice addition to my Disney library.how \\"show\\" was the focus.

Rex Applegate wrote this book for offensive combat.  In his chapter on handguns, Applegate wrote that there was no defending with the handgun-he trained his students to ATTACK first.  The chapters on unarmed and improvised weapon fighting were about asymmetrical combat-your enemy might have a knife, and you had a chair.  The sections on riot control may seem to have little bearing on personal defense; Applegate wrote \\"Riot Control Material and Techniques\\" during the turbulent 1960's.<br /><br />\\"Kill or Get Killed\\" is history.  It was cutting-edge stuff in 1943, and will still work today.  I refer to \\"expert systems\\" and \\"idiot systems\\" for personal combat-the former will be very effective, but you need years of training (synthetic experience) under the guidance of a competent instructor and with full school facilities.  \\"Idiot systems\\" have limited effectiveness, but within 40 hours or so of drilling with another student you will be an effective combatant.  \\"Kill or Get Killed\\" is what I call an \\"idiot system\\" and it follows the KISS principle.  If you think you can read a comic book and become a super ninja commando in less than fifteen minutes, reality will soon prove the error of your ways.  On the other hand, if you read \\"Kill or Get Killed,\\" then use it to produce a training program, then actually do the drills involved, within a few weeks of hard work you'll be more dangerous to an attacker than your attacker is to you.  There are better methods of close quarter shooting with pistol and long gun-Rex Applegate produced a video on modern point shooting.  A word about point shooting versus using the sights-you need to do both to be a competent shooter.  For handgun shooting, if you lack the time and other resources to do it right, the \\"Kill or Get Killed\\" technique will work.  The OSS sometimes had only an hour or two of firearms training for its agents before they were dropped behind enemy lines with a .32 automatic pistol for moral support.  Just keep in mind that your effective range will be about ten feet-Applegate claims fifty feet for the handgun, but that is for someone who has first been trained in the traditional \\"target pistol\\" course to 50 yards, then put through the entire OSS shooting school.  I corresponded with the late Colonel Applegate to clear up a few points about his pistol techniques, and I trained some of the Camp Doha Security Force officers in the point shooting techniques in addition to the standard FM 23-35 pistol course during five years on the Camp Doha security force.  These shooters had been trained, but had trouble qualifying-and also were deficient in gun fighting skills.  One of the firing tables took place at 7 meters-the officer was to draw his 9mm, rack the slide, and put 5 shots in the silhouette target in under 12 seconds.  Most of the officers didn't manage to get their M9 pistol out and fire one shot (they would often accidentally engage the safety while racking the slide).  After about 30 minutes of dry fire practice and \\"presentation drills\\" these security officers were able to draw from their M12 duty holsters and hit the target in about three seconds, finishing their five shots in under seven-still slow, but better.  When starting with pistol in a \\"low ready\\" (pioneered by Sykes and Fairbairn and passed on to Applegate) they were able to respond and put two shots into the target almost immediately.  The ITT training officer on the range was impressed, to say the least.<br /><br />The techniques in \\"Kill or Get Killed\\" work.  Some are not court-proof today.  You have to drill to standard, and keep drilling.  There are better products out there, but \\"Kill or Get Killed\\" will work okay.  Point shooting is coming back as part of a competent handgunner's skill set.  The hand-to-hand combat techniques work so long as you get in the best possible physical condition and maintain that, and you practice, practice, practice, and you act firstwhen confronted with force.  I have used \\"Kill or Get Killed\\" as a close combat training manual since 1973, a couple of years before enlisting in the US Marines.<br /><br />One inadvertent by-product is that when I watch war movies, I can tell the difference between vintage techniques and modern-the modern techniques were used in movies such as \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  Be warned-realistic and intensive training may make willing suspension of disbelief difficult!first when confronted with force.

I quibble-5 of those movies covered are mixtures of animation and live action.<br /><br />\\"Mouse Under Glass\\" is divided into ten chapters and examines the Disney movie formula using this outline:<br /><br /> Original Tale<br /><br /> Disney Version<br /><br /> Plot Holes<br /><br /> Attraction Offspring<br /><br /> Bloopers<br /><br /> Cutting Room Floor<br /><br /> Hidden Images<br /><br /> Strange Reactions<br /><br />The Original Tale and the Disney Version barely resemble each other.  This isn't unusual in Hollywood-take a look at \\"The Ten Commandments\\" or \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\\"  Even the Disney Version mutated from initial treatment to finished product.  I found out about this first-hand in 1983 when I made a movie.  I planned for a 45 minute mix of live actors and animated special effects and wound up with 7 minutes of stop-action animation and cheesy narration.  Walt Disney sought the best possible story within the limits imposed by economics and technology-then expanded the technology envelope to make the story better.  Art isn't rocket science-and look at all the mishaps in rocketry!<br /><br />Koenig wrote \\"...the most logical attraction (for a Bambi Ride) would be the shooting gallery.\\"  How about combining elements from other existing Disneyland rides to replicate Bambi's experience?  There's the change of the seasons.  Yes, a \\"shooting gallery\\" would be part of the ride-just like the shooting gallery in the Indiana Jones Adventure at Disneyland, with us guests as the target.  Don't forget the forest fire-if Mr. Toad winds up in Hell and the Pirates of the Caribbean light up the town, a forest fire should be easy!  End with the Great Prince of the Forest leaving Bambi as us guests exit.  Child's play!  Not to be, of course-\\"Bambi\\" is over 60 years old-not fresh enough!<br /><br />Hidden Images and Strange Reactions were two of the most enjoyable parts of the book.  One of the many sidebars explains the Hidden Mickeys.  A Disney Treasures DVD shows a Hidden Mickey in the Enchanted Tiki Room about the year 1964-the practice of inserting images in Disney movies is as old as Mickey Mouse.  Animators are a bunch of overage kids, fun loving kids.  Strange Reactions begins with \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,\\" but the public went ga-ga over a talking mouse and three pigs.  The movie, \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\\" kicked off a series of anti-Disney boycotts by organizations concerned that the Disney Company was following an agenda to corrupt America's children-and Roger Rabbit popularized looking for hidden images in Disney movies and theme parks.  It is almost like looking for Alfred in Hitchcock movies.<br /><br />Throughout \\"Mouse Under Glass\\" Koenig sprinkles sidebars such as Disney Tragedy Trivia Quiz, Top 10 Disney Oddities, and Orphan-O-Meter.  Peter Pan got no sympathy!<br /><br />Crisis has always faced the Disney Animated Features department.  Behind-the-scenes action in the Disney Company has sparked dozens of books such as Koenig's three.  Walt Disney almost left the animation business several times.  If not for the success of Snow White and \\"Cinderella,\\" Walt might have left the field twice.  The failure of \\"Fantasia,\\" \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" and \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" were hard blows to Walt.  Given the success of Walt's television series and Disneyland, it's possible that Walt would have shut down his animation department himself if he had lived.  After Walt's death, Disney animation coasted along.  Stagnation led to a corporate raider bid to take over the company (detailed in \\"Storming the Magic Kingdom\\") and sell off the parts for a quick buck.  Outsiders came in and saved the company-Michael Eisner and his team.  They were in charge during the Golden Age of the 1990's-andbrought new problems to Disney.  \\"Mouse Under Glass\\" ends with the decline of Disney Animation.  Today, Disney no longer has a traditional 2D animation department.<br /><br />Koenig nails the key to Walt's success-audience focus.  Walt Disney didn't always succeed, but he was in the story-telling business to have satisfied customers.

I collect books on \\"defense for women\\" and most of them are trash.  It's a shame, too.  I started collecting books on defensive techniques for women because if they worked for the physically and mentally soft, it would be even more effective for those who were physically and mentally conditioned to deal with the violent, ugly, and brutal parts of \\"civilization.\\" Paxton Quigley's advice on bottom-line security is still first rate.<br /><br />Women have to learn to stomp their own snakes for two reasons: criminals select helpless targets as victims; all too often, the woman's \\"significant other\\" turns out to be an abusive brute.<br /><br />Even if you do not want anything to do with guns, taking a gun safety course and learning their limitations will still give you the information to make yourself safer.  Someone waving a pistol at you from 100 feet away is usually not going to be able to hit you except by accident--so run to a place of safety!  On the other hand, if you're confronted at five feet, you need to pretend to cooperate until you have an opportunity to get away.<br /><br />Quigley evaluates defensive tools available in 1990 and makes recommendations based upon her experience.  I am a large man (6' 3\\") and Paxton Quigley had to stand on an ammo crate in order to see over the sales counter and sign her books.  In her book, she writes of carrying a whippy little steak knife for self protection.  Quigley's idea of self defense is avoiding injury--certainly a worthy goal.  I hang out with America's warriors and their idea of self-defense is hurting the other guy worse.  Quigley achieves her goal, avoiding injury, by being alert to danger.  She uses her handgun as credible deterrance--I have no doubt that she can shut down a hostile male attacker.  Quigley projects this attitude without coming off as a phoney or hard-case.

The sterile world of money-grubbing capitalism provides the funding for production--but sometimes the \\"bottom line\\" people see only green and forget how they got there.  \\"Storming the Magice Kingdom\\" details why and how Roy E. Disney (Roy O.'s son and Walt's nephew) got Michael Eisner to take over as Disney's CEO.  Copyright 1987 means that the book's data ended somewhere in 1986, before the Golden Age of \\"The Lion King\\" and other great animated features of the early 1990's, before Frank Wells died in a helicopter crash, before Michael Eisner fell out with most of his friends and co-workers, before the big anti-Disney boycots...<br /><br />Funny--Walt Disney Productions was going to be bought out when its stock was $47 a share (in 1984 dollars)--I just checked my Disney stock and it's around $25 a share, down $10 from what I paid for it in 1998.  If I was as enamored of money as I am with books and movies, I'd be put out.  Will corporate raiders return?  Who is the next Michael Eisner?<br /><br />I was only ten when Walt Disney died, and only fifteen when Roy O. Disney died.  I'd rather see another Walt and Roy Disney--visionaries.  Roy E.

Today, the Disney Company has gotten out of the traditional hand-drawn 2D animation--the bean counters say \\"too expensive!\\"  Look at the motion picture industry--theater receipts down for the third year in a row.

For me, finding out about these problems made me appreciate how special that place is--that Disneyland manages to function at all is a miracle.  Disneyland manages to operate more smoothly than other theme parks and amusement parks.<br /><br />Here is the human face of Disneyland.  Disney magic is created by people: we humans have our vices.

It's a wonder that the place hasn't fallen off the end of the world!  Like any place else, Disneyland has its share of problems.  Personnel policies disliked at Disneyland are industry standard.

Yet most G.I.'s in West Berlin were ignorant of the threat--despite constant G-2 briefings and sensational newspaper stories.<br /><br />Collins's book is easy to read, well organized, and based on workable personal security procedures.  One warning--Collins puts personal security above obeying local laws.  Collins says that the major threat to Americans overseas is being complacent and arrogant--and that ordinary crime is the next big threat (I think it is motor vehicle traffic!).  Collins talks about assessing your own personal security situation, then addresses specifics: your residence, your office, your automobile, weapons (including firearms), and how to integrate your family into a security plan.  How-to information on surviving being kidnapped and held hostage is relavent even 25 years after Collins wrote \\"Living in Troubled Lands.\\"  At the end of the book is a series of security checklists.  You won't be able to get a better personal security program without spending several thousand dollars.  This book will \\"teach you to fish\\" so that you will be able to provide most of your own security.  Avoiding terrorist attack is mostly a matter of staying out of the terrorists' crosshairs.<br /><br />I used \\"Living in Troubled Lands\\" as my personal security blueprint through two 3-year tours in Germany as an American soldier, through a 5-year and a 2-year contract as an anti-terrorist security officer in the Middle East, and for my mundane anti-crime personal security program in the United States.  Professionally, these principles made me an effective security officer and kept me out of trouble as a soldier in Germany and in the Middle East last year.  I keep handing out copies of Collins's book to friends and coworkers because these procedures work.<br /><br />Individuals must take charge of their own personal security.  No matter how much professional security a person has, that person can derail his own program--\\"his\\" is appropriate, given the number of men killed or kidnapped because they gave their protectors the slip to keep a date with their girlfriends--who just happened to be part of a criminal gang, terrorist group, or in the employ of a hostile government or rival corporation.

Many biographies on famous people fit an agenda.  In the case of Walt Disney, many biographies have axes to grind.  Walter Elias Disney was a complex man.  Douglas Brode illustrates how the conventional wisdom about Walt Disney isn't accurate.  Walt's father was a socialist--in the days of the Red Scare, no less.  \\"From Walt to Woodstock\\" provides ample evidence that Walt Disney was no reactionary--the commonly-held image of the Disney company is of a right-wing conservative corporation promoting an agenda out of the 19th Century.<br /><br />When I ordered this book, I was expecting the thesis to be \\"Walt the Bohemian.\\"  After reading the book, I got the impression that Walt did not set out to create the counterculture, but instead laid the groundwork for it by trying to improve mainstream society.  Not just by making great entertainment, Walt Disney field-tested urban planning, social engineering, and mass media techniques.  I think Walt did improve mainstream American society.  Walt Disney was a progressive man--progress was good!  View his presentation of E.P.C.O.T. --made about six weeks before he died--and see for yourself.  Go back to 1943 and the release of \\"Victory Through Air Power.\\"  Look at Walt Disney's prophetic \\"Man in Space.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed Brode's book.  His viewpoints on Disney movies were fresh and new for me, and now I want to see them again to see the things Brode saw in them.  Usually I get something out of a book even when I don't like it.  Many books on Walt Disney paint a dark picture of an evil, greedy man--if not for the name, I wouldn't know who they were talking about.  Brode's Walt is someone I'd like to have for a friend.<br /><br />I'm happy to add this book to my collection of Walt Disney biographies.	2005-06-23

I initially read this fine book in 1998 while working as an anti-terrorist security officer in the Middle East.  When my National Guard company mobilized and deployed to the Middle East during 2004, I bought three more copies and took them overseas with me so that I could train the company's leadership--and through them, the rest of the company.  My unit had zero firefights, but I felt better prepared because of Dave Grossman.<br /><br />I do think that he overstates the link between violent video games, rap music, and television violence and school yard murders--but I just picked up a copy of his latest book, \\"On Combat.\\"  The school child mass murderers had this in common--they were all products of the public school system.  I don't hear much shouting about closing down public schools!  On the other hand, I can change my mind, given enough time and information.  Overstating a case doesn't mean that Grossman was wrong about violent entertainment.<br /><br />I will argue that today's society is not the most wicked and violent ever.  Teenage mass murders are a constant throughout history.  Ever hear of Alexander the Great?  How about those Romans?  Anybody for a Children's Crusade?  Look at the carnage before, during, and after the American Civil War.  Many of the participants were \\"minors.\\"  Besides, conditions have changed so much that it isn't the same old Planet Earth anymore.  For one thing, more actions are considered murder today than a century ago.  Two examples: alcohol and lynch mobs.  In the old days, claiming that you were drunk when you killed someone was sometimes enough to derail a murder charge--alcohol was an acceptable excuse for murder.  Today, having too much alcohol in your bloodstream is considered attempted murder.  As for lynch mobs, a century ago in America black men were murdered and the people doing the hanging would brag about it--and not be prosecuted.  There are other things that indicate the changes in laws and public attitudes.  We have more laws to break.  How could crime rates drop?<br /><br />But \\"On Killing\\" addresses important issues.  Who kills?  How?  Why?  What is the aftermath for the killer?<br /><br />Grossman references S. L. A. Marshall at length.  In \\"Men Against Fire,\\" Marshall stated that a major factor in failure to fire was that society conditioned men to refrain from killing.  Grossman gave me the impression that this was a genetic restraint.  No matter--\\"on Killing\\" blueprints effective training programs to enable killing.  Note that the diagrams and text give multiple enablers--it isn't a simple one-factor process.  Humans are complex beings living in a complex society.  No one cause will enable or disable killing.<br /><br />How one feels after killing is another subject.  The connection is that one must have killed in order to suffer from the ill effects of killing, but the aftermath of killing another human being is not the same thing as preparing for the killing.  \\"Decent people\\" are supposed to feel guilt and shame after having killed--Grossman examines these society-induced factors and comments that some people do kill without apparent disabling emotional consequences.  Most do not.  Grossman doesn't mention that we are a death-worshiping culture, trying to stave off death by various ineffective magical means.  \\"On Killing\\" does cover the emotional costs paid by many of our military and police protectors for doing what is necessary to protect America, American lives, and our way of life--killing other human beings.<br /><br />This book should be read by everyone who can vote, by all those in the force professions, and most especially by all pacifists.

These wars include and are not limited to Iraq and Afghanistan.  The United States has been targeted by Middle Eastern terrorist since the late 1960's.  As long as any of these exist, the United States will face Islamic warriors on jihad: the existance of corrupt governments in the Middle East, the existance of the state of Israel, failure to convert wholesale to the \\"right flavor\\" of Islam, providing a market for Middle Eastern oil, and lack of a global Islamic empire.  The United States first fought Islamic warriors at the beginning of the 19th Century, when a handful of Marines, Sailors, and mercenaries fought and routed the Barbary Pirates.  Following the Spanish-American War, Filippino Moros (Muslim tribes on Mindinao) proved so fierce that the .38 caliber Colt revolver was replaced by the .45 caliber Colt automatic pistol.  Thus, the Muslim irregular is an old enemy for the United States.  Surviving this foe requires a comprehensive and multi-pronged strategy.  Basic to a viable startegy is understanding who the enemy is, why he fights, and lastly, how.  Poole concentrates on the tactical defeat of the Islamic militant.<br /><br />American military units are poor at the short-range fight.  Hand-to-hand combat has been neglected for reasons ranging from \\"why waste efforts on something of marginal effectiveness\\" to creating a female-friendly military environment.  These lame excuses favored two groups--military careerists, and the enemy.  Close combat training is difficult and dangerous.  A zero-defect mentality coupled with the desire to empower women--without giving women the tools that empower--is being overtaken by current events.  Units going to Iraq or Afghanistan are getting crash courses in city fighting, room-to-room combat, firing from moving vehicles, and reacting to ambush.  Combat units are learning to detect and defuse ambushes before they occur.  The US bases in the Middle East are hard targets, with defense in depth.  Poole alludes to the timidity about sustaining casualties--it does hamper operations.  Also hampering operations is the fear of inflicting collateral damage.  Poole points out that skilled infantry can defeat the enemy with a minimum of casualties.  This has been happening in Iraq, and the new Iraqi forces are taking over the burden of fighting the Iraqi insurgency.  Unlike South Vietnam in 1968, there are not neighbors ready to pounce on Iraq with a large conventional army equipped with lots of tanks, artillery, and aircraft.  And if there were, tanks and artillery and aircraft battles are the United States' strong suite.  The war for Iraq will be won or lost in street battles.  Poole advocates bottom-up squad-focused training and doctrine to defeat the Islamic irregular fighter threat.  Because the United States is fighting a war, many of the careerists now recognize that small arms training, squad tactics, and yes, plain old brawling have to be part of the bag of tricks.  Marines paid at least lip service to this new old doctrine--now the Army, the Navy, and even the Air Force are conducting realistic and rigorous squad-level training to better-prepare American service members for duty in the Middle East.  Trouble is, old habits die hard.  Poole recommends that the US goes further, adopting a bottoms-up tactical doctrine that is \\"circumstantially unique, surprise oriented, and threat compensating.\\"  This will shift a larger burden to junior leaders.  The biggest shift will be to the individual soldier or Marine on patrol--currently, the capability to run each fire-team size patrol (four or five soliders) from the White House exists.  There is a great temptation to do so, even though President Bush was a fighter pilot, not an infantry team leader.  Poole argues that the man on the spot is better able to decide what action to take.  He's correct as long as the man on the spot has both situational awareness (something that is hard or impossible to do by remote control) and has the other information needed to make the dicision.  Plus one more thing--a doctrine that puts decision-making at the lowest possible level.  America's most effieicnt industries do this already--the same high-quality people are in business and in our all-volunteer military.  It takes time and effort to make a well-rounded knowledgable soldier.<br /><br />It will be a difficult task.  Saddam's minions were specifically trained in deception techniques.  The laundry list Poole provides in \\"Tactics of the Crescent Moon\\" read like a James Bond movie: advanced psychological training, mind control techniques, and a ruthlessness not possible if we are to meet American societal norms and what Poole terms \\"moral behavior.\\"  One section of Chapter 11 is titled, \\"Tactics and Morality Are Not Mutually Exclusive.\\"<br /><br />The Islamic warrior can be beaten.  Poole examines the tactical shortcomings of several Islamic jihad groups.  A major problem with the Islamic imperial movement is that the jihadists must play first to the Islamic world.  It isn't that the jihadists are ineffective playing to a Western audience--they are many times more effective at the media game against the West than the West is against the Islamic world.  The guerrilla theater bombing of Madrid did cause the withdrawal of Spanish soldiers.  Kidnapping foreigners and holding them hostage until a Western government complies isn't working out very well now, but held great promise while it was still novel.  More effective is that the kidnappings have slowed down the flood of foreign workers into Iraq--there's more to winning a guerrilla campaign than killing American soldiers.  Guerrilla war is a war of ideas and images.<br /><br />Poole identifies a major weakness of American forces: movement skills.  How can American infantry move through a foreign urban area unseen?  The jihadists do so routinely.  Some elements, such as Al Queda, have recently began losing their \\"invisibility cloak\\" because they're outsiders and don't blend in as well as the insiders.  Al Queda's operations have been increasingly directed at Iraqi civilians--the US forces are bottled up in their fortified bastions and there are fewer foreign workersl  By necessity of having to act, and having driven off most of the targets, Al Queda has to conduct ethnic cleansing, and is alienating Iraq as a result.  The US is not only increasing its mobility when it does patrol, but increasingly the new Iraqi police and Iraqi army are becoming more effective at confronting and destroying Al Queda and other insurgency movements.  The number one problem in Iraq is still criminal gangs.  This fragmented opposition to the new Iraqi government is compartmented by accident and has trouble coordinating large-scale operations, but is resistant to disruption because the many elements are seperated from each other.  In many cases the seperate elements are actualy bitter hereditary enemies--temporarily united to fight the \\"Crusader\\" invaders.  The fragility of this alliance is off-set by the fact that all these insurgency movements are self-contained.  If Al Queda was smashed today, it would be a body blow to the insurgency, but not a knock-out punch.  The insurgents use the Iraqi population as a shield and data bank.  US artillery crews are being used as infantry because the cannon shells are not very useful in this war, but infantry patrols are indespensible.<br /><br />Will the US military establishment finally follow the model of Heinlein's 1956 novel, \\"Starship Trooper?\\"  Heinlein's elite force was the Mobile Infantry, a handful of high-tech troops that applied force surgically in surprise raids that combined speed, stealth, firepower, and intelligence.  When one of these four was missing, the raid came to grief.  In that novel, the most dangerous enemies, the \\"bugs,\\" moved underground unseen (much like the Oriental warriors in Poole's books) and defeated Earth's soldiers in close combat where the humans were at a disadvantage.  The hero of that novel, a sergeant named Zim, used initiative and on-the-spot situational awareness to capture a \\"bug brain,\\" winning a hard-fought campaign.  Heinlein's novels showcased the strengths and weaknesses that Poole's book discusses--both American and Oriental warrior.  The Islamic warrior is not as readily identifiable as Heinlein's bug warriors.  The Islamic terrorist is no hive creature--and the hive in that science fiction novel proved to be crafty and innovative.<br /><br />One last note--suicide warriors are nothing new for American GI's.  The Japanese kamakazi was the most-organized and may be the most famous example, but he wasn't the first.  Many American Indian tribes ritually purified their warrior's souls before battle--the warrior didn't enter battle to die, but was already dead.  This freed him from worrying about death and made him more effective.  The US cavalry was more worried about catching fleeing Indian bands than encountering \\"suicidal\\" Indian braves.  In the Philippines, the Moro ritually prepared himself to enter Paradise prior to running amok with a barong among US troops.  About the same time, the Boxers in China underwent pre-battle preparation that made them \\"immune\\" to bullets and was more or less funeral rites.  Despite being \\"godless communists,\\" the Chinese and North Korean soldiers sometimes used the suicide option, complete with body bomb.  The Viet Cong and NVA were credited with doing this frequently.  My question is why American soldiers are not better-prepared to face this common threat.  Suicide bombers proved to be cost-effective in lives for the PLO--one truck bomb took out the Marine barracks in Beruit and killed over 240 Americans.  One PLO suicide driver died.  The American response was to bomb a refugee camp--two aircraft shot down, two naval aviators killed, and one captured--and zero PLO fighters were in the camp.  Given the disparity in firepower, the suicide bomber seems to be a lifesaver for the insurgency movement.  Non-suicide ambushes between American forces and insurgents in Iraq typically end one of two ways--the insurgents escape inflicting few casualties, or the insurgents get wiped out while inflicting multiple American casualties.  One successful Iraqi tactic is to drive a car bomb into an American convoy.  Because many of the drivers are now contractor personnel, the suicide bomber may only kill some poor kid from Pakistan or another Islamic country--but suicide bombers die so that the insurgency can strike blows with minimal losses.  Sometimes a car bomb will kill four or five American servicemen and make headlines.<br /><br />Poole mentions how the human wave attack seems to disregard human life, but actually is a smart, life-sparing tactic for America's Oriental enemies.  Rather than wasting the lives of the Iraqi insurgency, suicide bombers seem to be a cost-effective way of killing the intended target, and have the bonus of psychological impact on the Western media, and the American soldier.

As with most prophets, he overstates the case.  For example, Poole keeps harping on how America is focused on \\"technology\\" when he means \\"hardware.\\"  Technology is much more than hardware--it is the practical application of knowledge.  The tactics and techniques discussed in \\"Phantom Soldier\\" are knowledge, practically applied.  It is true that American military people brag about \\"American initiative\\" while tightening top-down control over the individual front-line infantryman.  It is also true that infantry training could be better.  The current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are changing the military--with large numbers of Internet-savvy soldiers and Marines on-line, tips and tactical techniques are being swapped with a speed that makes the ossified TRADOC (Training and Doctrine Command) seem AWOL.  Many of Poole's recommendations are being put into practice already.  There's still a lot to be done.<br /><br />The descriptions of how the Oriental warrior thinks and fights are accurate.  As for the details on the battles, there is a lot of room for doubt.  Poole said it himself--the Oriental warrior shows a false face, letting us see only what he wants us to see, which is often merely reinforcing our own false premises.  But saying that the East is behind the West in technology is inaccurate.  Oh, perhaps the hardware in the East isn't as new, but quite often the hardware isn't appropriate to the battlefield.  Displaying a false face is a technology.  Avoiding the use of electronic communications is a technology to defeat our mastery of the air waves.  Hardware always brings new problems to the situation it was supposed to solve--using these new problems to defeat the hardware's advantage is an old technique.<br /><br />The United States infantry has always suffered disadvantages and had advantages over its foes.  In the French and Indian Wars, the colonial militia was famous for adopting Indian techniques and beating the Indian at his own game.  These techniques were wrongly credited with defeating the world's then-finest army, the British Royal Army--not true.  The difference between victory and defeat is often just a matter of perception.  Poole brings this out on the chapters concerning Vietnam.  It was often the case that both the American and communist forces involved in a battle could declare victory--which flies in the face of zero-sum common sense.  Most people would logically conclude that one side would lose and the other would win--and that's that!  A significant minority will concede that perhaps both sides can emerge as losers from the same battle.  Victory in battle is a matter of achieving specific \\"successes,\\" such as the western notions of seizing real estate, capturing weapons and personnel, and counting enemy dead.  By these metrics, the United States lost the Revolutionary War--and the War of 1812.<br /><br />Even during the dark days of World War Two, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, American military units could and did fight the Oriental way and win.  That wasn't the norm, and in fact successful programs that had been developed during America's long war against the Indian nations and the \\"Banana Wars\\" of the 20's and 30's did see some success in the Vietnam War--but these programs were ended from the top.  Marines were exposed to Sun Tsu during the 1930's, and several Marine officers served with Mao.  The problems that led to the termination of these programs were lack of media savvy, lack of \\"success indicators\\" for the innovators, and the sad fact of ego clashes between rather junior innovators and senior leadership.  You cannot \\"win\\" when everyone else thinks that you've lost--and you can still lose when everyone else thought you were winning--winning and losing are often merely a matter of perception.  The Soviet Union was \\"winning\\" the Cold War right up to the moment that the Berlin Wall fell down because the American media had been seduced and the \\"warmonging\\" American administration had little credibility.  A large part of this was the lack of indicators about who was winning and losing in the Cold War.  How could the United States be winning with severe drug problems, rampant crime, unemployment, and widespread poverty?  These problems were successfully concealed by the Soviet Union--until their house of cards collapsed.  Innovators often lack social skills.  Being a little monkey, rather than one of the 500-pound gorillas, also hurts.  Senior leaders define \\"success\\" and \\"failure.\\"  When the little monkeys clash with the big monkeys--or the 500-pound gorilla--the little monkeys lose.  It's a problem that Poole will have getting his ideas accepted as doctrine--he's stepping on senior toes.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Phantom Soldier,\\" warts and all, because the emphasis on deception in war, on decentralized control, on training first-class infantry are the keys to winning the peace in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and the \\"war on crime\\" in the United States.  Poole mentions it in his other books--we've got a homefront war against terrorists from the Middle East who are constantly trying to destroy the Great Satan.  China has a vested interest in harming America.  There are many nations that would like to see the United States knocked down several notches.  Our own news media downplays American successes and Middle Eastern excesses and plays up the \\"underdog\\" Islamic \\"insurgency\\" and American \\"atrocities\\"--the reason is the nature of news as entertainment and the economics of a \\"free press.\\"  Fortunately, Osama bin Laden and his cronies are more interested in winning the hearts and minds of Middle Easterners and Muslims than Americans, so their announcements don't always play well in this country.  They do a better job than Saddam Hussain did!<br /><br />Poole's appendix includes a thoughtful explaination of Sun Tzu's principled of war for practical application.  I liked his index and bibliography--and I am in  the process of checking his sources.  That's the soul of the scientific method--independant verification.<br /><br />Too bad that performance in war games counts for so much careerwise.  In a zero-defect military, the textbook answer is the only right one during military exercises.  This led to poor performance for the American submarine service during the initial part of World War Two, but fortunately, the Japanese practiced Sun Tzu only on the tactical level and not strategically.  With a fixation on warriors (and war ships) the Japanese not only failed to successfully interdict the American logistics system, but failed to protect their own.  The place to make mistakes is in training.  Making them in battle cost lives.  Poole rightfully criticizes the mainstream American military mindset, but doesn't identify its source.  Even so, Poole's insight into the tactical mindset of the Oriental warrior makes this book a valuable addition to our society's force professional's library.ion was \\"winning\\" the Cold War right up to the moment that the Berlin Wall fell down because the American media had been seduced and the \\"warmonging\\" American administration had little credibility.  A large part of this was the lack of indicators about who was winning and losing in the Cold War.  How could the United States be winning with severe drug problems, rampant crime, unemployment, and widespread poverty?  These problems were successfully concealed by the Soviet Union--until their house of cards collapsed.  Innovators often lack social skills.  Being a little monkey, rather than one of the 500-pound gorillas, also hurts.  Senior leaders define \\"success\\" and \\"failure.\\"  When the little monkeys clash with the big monkeys--or the 500-pound gorilla--the little monkeys lose.  It's a problem that Poole will have getting his ideas accepted as doctrine--he's stepping on senior toes.   <br /> <br />I recommend \\"Phantom Soldier,\\" warts and all, because the emphasis on deception in war, on decentralized control, on training first-class infantry are the keys to winning the peace in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and the \\"war on crime\\" in the United States.  Poole mentions it in his other books--we've got a homefront war against terrorists from the Middle East who are constantly trying to destroy the Great Satan.  China has a vested interest in harming America.  There are many nations that would like to see the United States knocked down several notches.  Our own news media downplays American successes and Middle Eastern excesses and plays up the \\"underdog\\" Islamic \\"insurgency\\" and American \\"atrocities\\"--the reason is the nature of news as entertainment and the economics of a \\"free press.\\"  Fortunately, Osama bin Laden and his cronies are more interested in winning the hearts and minds of Middle Easterners and Muslims than Americans, so their announcements don't always play well in this country.  They do a better job than Saddam Hussain did! <br /> <br />Poole's appendixincludes a thoughtful explaination of Sun Tzu's principled of war for practical application.  I liked his index and bibliography--and I am in  the process of checking his sources.  That's the soul of the scientific method--independant verification.   <br /> <br />Too bad that performance in war games counts for so much careerwise.  In a zero-defect military, the textbook answer is the only right one during military exercises.  This led to poor performance for the American submarine service during the initial part of World War Two, but fortunately, the Japanese practiced Sun Tzu only on the tactical level and not strategically.  With a fixation on warriors (and war ships) the Japanese not only failed to successfully interdict the American logistics system, but failed to protect their own.  The place to make mistakes is in training.  Making them in battle cost lives.  Poole rightfully criticizes the mainstream American military mindset, but doesn't identify its source.

World War Two made the modern Marine Corps, and battles such as Iwo Jima still justify the Corps existance today.  Osprey's \\"US Marine Corps 1941-45\\" is quite informative--I have a large number of history books and official and unofficial manuals on the Marine Corps.  I wanted this book to help me build small WWII Marine Corps units in minature for display and to develop accurate war games--Osprey didn't disappoint.  I did note that on page 9 the line and block charts showed 1965 organizations, but I know from personal experience that the official manuals have errors in them and the rest of the book made up for this typo.  First, the detail on Marine units from Defense Battalions to Raider Battalions was amazing in such a thin volume.  The \\"ordinary\\" rifle regiments and BLTs were not neglected.  The period photos showed rare pieces of gear in action, and the famous Opsrey color plates proved valuable for detailing my minature Marine collection.  Where there are Marines, the Navy isn't far behind, and this slim book had color plates of Corpsmen, SeaBees, and the crew of landing craft.  Unique Marine weapons were also pictured--the M1903A1 rifle with Unertl telescopic sight, Johnson Light Machine Gun, the Reising submachine gun--and the British-designed Boys .55 caliber anti-tank rifle.  Order of battle information, too?  Unit histories as well?  The information is a balance between covering most of the subjects and covering those subjects in depth.  I would have liked a book list in the back, but the index is handy.  I recommend getting \\"US World war II Amphibious Tactics, Army and Marine Corps, Pacific Theater,\\" also by Osprey, as a companion volume to this book.	2005-06-15

This volume is concise and won't break the piggy bank, nor will it take up the entire weekend reading.  Covering the development of landing ships and landing craft and detailing crews, passengers, armaments and cargo, this book is great for the scale model builder or the wargamer (I do both).  In addition, the way the boats were lined up for landing on fortified islands and the various beach party operations were explained.  I've been looking for the World War Two editions of what I learned in my amphibious warfare correspondence course while serving as a Marine in Hawaii for years--this is less expensive and easier to use than my other volumes.  I did participate in one amphibious landing in 1979--in Norway, as part of a Marine Reserve rifle company--but my grunt's eye veiw of the practice landing and week-long exercise with the Norwegians and other NATO troops was quite myopic.  This Osprey book took me through all levels from the Marines scrambling down the cargo nets to the planning staffs at the Navy Department.  If you need a guide to American amphibious operations in the Pacific during World War Two, get this book first.	2005-06-15
US	48667725	R73WWUXXY0GGG	1841766623	600690428	1: World War II Infantry Tactics: Squad and Platoon (Elite)	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Excellent graphics, good general introduction	For a 64-page book, this is an outstanding value.  I have several hundred books and manuals on military subjects, including a number of War Department, Department of the Navy, and Department of Defense manuals.  I purchased \\"World War II Infantry Tactics--Squad and Platoon\\" as a guide for building minature World War Two small units.  I already knew quite a bit about US Army and USMC squads and platoons from World War Two--and I am very familiar with the current stuff because of my 23 years of military service--but I don't know everything.  British infantry squads have different assumptions and \\"character\\" than American squads.  They don't fight the same way, they don't look the same in the field, and even if they had the same equipment they'd use it differently.  I'm not as familiar with German infantry squads, but what Dr. Bull wrote is comprehensive and accurate.  If you need more detailed information, you'll have to collect a bigger library.  This book is on the squad and platoon--for order of battle information, go to books dealing with divisions and regiments.  A note about rifle squads and platoons in the US Army and Marines--they usually go into combat with less than their full TO&E allotment of personnel.  During World War Two, the general attitude was that anybody could be cannon-fodder foot soldiers.  Because of this attitude, special soldier units such as Ranger battalions had to be formed to make up for lack of skilled infantry rifle companies.  General McNair trained the average infantry Joe as well as he could, but the emphasis for quality personnel and other investments went to the Army Air Force and then to Engineer, Armor, Artillery, and Airborne units--with the infantry getting low priority.  Audy Murphy, the most-decorated American soldier of the war, was rejected by the Marines and the Paratroopers for being to small, skinny, and lacking education, proving that the metrics used for predicting success weren't perfect.  Dr. Bull didn't cover Marines in this volume, which is okay--the USMC rifle squad differed radically after 1944 from the US Army infantry squad even though the US Army had more soldiers in the Pacific war than there were Marines.  The training, tactics and mind set of Marines and Soldiers from the same nation differed sufficiently that plugging a few into the other service's rifle squad resulted in disaster--they don't interchange well even today.  Organization, equipment, and tactics exist to serve doctrine.  \\"World War II Infantry Tactics\\" details the differences between infantry rifle squads and platoons from three nations.  I'd like to see Dr. Bull write on the squads and platoons from the USSR and Imperial Japan, as well as France, China, and the smaller nations.s in this volume, which is okay--the USMC rifle squad differed radically after 1944 from the US Army infantry squad even though the US Army had more soldiers in the Pacific war than there were Marines.

US	48667725	R1J9E1S1TP5H7G	1574885537	25045263	Through Our Enemies' Eyes: Osama bin Laden, Radical Islam, and the Future of America	Books	5	21	23	N	Y	It's a new/old threat	I read \\"Through Our Enemies' Eyes\\" while on active duty with the Nevada National Guard in the Middle East.  I have spent eight years in this part of the world, and Anonymous has pegged the viewpoint of many people in this region concerning the United States and Osama Bin Laden.  Opinion here isn't uniform--but the United States is seen as an outsider.<br /><br />Osama Bin Laden is not a new type of threat.  The Assassin cult in this area was also a stateless movement promoting religious conformity to an ideal--and may have been the force that ended the Islamic empire.  Then there was another stateless movement of anarchists, the Terrorists, about 100 years ago.  The most successful movement went from stateless to world superpower during the period 1830 to 1990--yes, those Cold War foes of the West, the Communists.  The Communists were very much a stateless organization until after the Russian Revolution. Once they established themselves as a national government, the threat of Communism changed.  That's why Trotsky was murdered in Mexico--he was trying to export revolution the \\"old fashioned way\\" like Bin Laden is doing now.  Problem: having a homeland means being a target.  Stalin had to kill Trotsky in order to save the Soviet Union.<br /><br />I have purchased several copies of this book as gifts for friends and relatives still serving in military and government office because this is an important book for their professional bookshelves.  My one reservation is that the threat posed by Bin Laden's organization (and the greater threat posed by Bin Laden as a symbol) (and the even greater threat of American myopia) is that Bin Laden is not really something new or different.  The author may have chosen to portray Bin Laden as \\"new\\" because the current American government mindset--the one that foundered in Vietnam--blinds us to reality in the modern world.	2004-12-28
