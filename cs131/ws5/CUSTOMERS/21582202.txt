Full of riveting twists and turns you may find yourself rooting for the bad guy with this one.  <br /> <br />Nate Kenny has successfully wooed Monica. Without much convincing she has agreed to become his bride. Although he loves her, his desire to get married is strongly fueled for his obsession to have a child. Unfortunately Monica is not on the baby fast track and feels that they should wait for three years before starting a family. Due to a genetic problem they find that Monica is unable to carry a child to full term. Feeling deceived Nate is desperate to get out of his marriage. The one thing standing in the way of severing ties with his wife is the 60-million dollar pre-nuptial agreement. Much to Nate's chagrin the only way around the pre-nup is if his wife cheats on him, but Monica doesn't have an adulterous bone is her body. Or does she? <br /> <br />If it weren't for bad luck Lewis Waters wouldn't have any. When he accidentally smashes his car into Nate's Bentley his life seemingly takes a turn for the better.

She was indeed the Black Angel of Harlem. <br />  <br />Angel of Harlem is definitely a great novel of worth.  I was truly inspired by the biographical and historical information on this female pioneer's accomplishments.  The sites of the NYC area, the Harlem Renaissance acquaintances (Zora Neale Hurston, Paul Roberson, Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Fats Waller and a host of others) of Dr. Chinn, along with information surrounding her musical mastery were treats within the chronicle. Ms. Haulsey has penned a prized novel regarding a woman with phenomenal integrity and breathtaking compassion.  <br />  <br />Readincolor Reviewer <br />Emily Means Willis	2005-01-07

He Had It Coming is definitely the most hilarious book I've read in quite some time. In the spirit of the movie Misery, Ms. Spencer is telling the tale of fans who aren't pleased with an author's work. But this book is much funnier! Camika Spencer, if I ever meet you I want to shake your hand. Never before has a fiction novel been so damn TRUE.  <br /> <br />Marcus Brooks, (look at his initials) is the author that every woman loves to hate. The air surrounding him is filled with arrogance and his conversation is peppered with attitude. With the impending release of his next novel B-I-T-C-H-E-S he has women everywhere in an uproar. He is being censored everywhere for this misogynistic piece of work and he has turned the whole situation into a man vs. woman battle.  <br /> <br />Well the women of one particular bookclub make a decision that they are not going to take his arrogant, narcissistic, nasty, ugly, crappy, stank azz behaviour anymore. They are going to do something about it. What do they do? They kidnap his arrogant tail to make him rewrite the novel. <br /> <br />Although this novel is too funny for words, the fact that there are many male authors out here who are carbon copies of this fictitious character speaks volumes about the literary industry. Some of these authors are so freaking obnoxious you just want to say, \\"Get over yourself buddy. All you did was write a book, and uhm it ain't all that either.\\" But when people get tired they get TIRED. Consumers are a strange breed, they might not say anything but when they stop buying books, well you know what happens. When enough is enough these super overinflated, egotistical, ignorant book-writing, wonder authors will realize they are just that, OVER! <br /> <br />Readincolor Reviewer  <br />Simone Says	2005-01-07

The story starts off with eight-year old Malena, a daddy's girl dealing with the loss of her father. The concept of death is a difficult thing to wrap her adolescent mind around. In time, she begins to decipher what death is when her father never returns home. With the love of God instilled in her, Malena believes it is her father's voice she hears that guides her on her journey to adulthood. Throughout college and beyond Malena begins to forget her Christian upbringing and becomes someone that even she doesn't even seem to recognize. Her career, material possessions and carefree lifestyle have become the most important things in her life. <br />But her childhood friend and admirer, Grant Carpenter, who told her early on that one day she'd be his wife, suddenly resurfaces in her life. Grant is a devout Christian with a staunch belief in God. Malena isn't certain that she needs to have a relationship with him because of their age difference. Unable to get over her father's death, she manages to push Grant away despite her love for him. It is only when she finds her life is empty and unfulfilled despite her successes that she realizes that she is spiraling out of control. She then realizes that no one can help her except the God that she has turned her back on. Will Malena heed to the voice within her head? If she does, will it be too late for Malena and Grant? Will Grant be able to forgive her for all her transgressions? <br />Author Tanya Marie Lewis does a splendid job of answering all of these questions in this inspirational story. Although short for a typical novel, Misdemeanor, focusing on the important things in Malena's life, omitting unnecessary materialistic descriptions. I thoroughly enjoyed Misdemeanor, and I look forward to reading the second installment, Bloom, by Linda Dominique Grosvenor, in the Cradle Robbers Series. <br />Vanessa A.

Thomas is captivating right from the start. Sasha Borianni is a smart and sexy thirty-eight-year-old woman who is involved with Cole, a married man. After a night of passion, she thinks she hears something and turns toward her bedroom's doorway. Standing there with a loaded gun is Cole's wife Paulette. Cole, who is lying next to Sasha, wakes up and before he can ask any questions, the gun goes off.<br />This scene sets the pace not only for the novel, but also for the rollercoaster ride known as Sasha's life. After the traumatizing shooting, Sasha tries to get her life back on track, but it's difficult. The media will not let the story die plus her bedroom is a constant memory, forcing her to sleep downstairs. <br />When she is offered a dream job opportunity as a personal assistant to Phoenix Carter, one of the NBA's hottest players, Sasha jumps at the chance for a new career and a new beginning. <br />Although Phoenix is engaged to be married, he lives the fast life that many million-dollar making athletes lead. When he's not on the court, it's all about extravagant parties, fancy cars, expensive jewelry, and of course sex, and lots of it. At twenty-three years old, he is barely older than Sasha's son Owen, but she finds Phoenix irresistibly sexy and before long, the two are involved in a torrid affair. Not only is Sasha on-call as his assistant, but also she is at his beck and call in terms of sex. Although she feels guilty about her relationship with Phoenix it definitely has its perks, such as the Lexus SUV she now drives and other fine gifts including a diamond tennis bracelet. However, what she really wants is true love with a man that only she can claim. But does she deserve such a love?<br />Trent seems to think so. Trent, who Sasha meets at her best friend's house, is a handsome electrician who is the same age as Sasha and a romantic at heart. Inevitably, they quickly fall into a whirlwind romance. With political aspirations, Trent appears to be her dream man, but he has issues of his own. Unbeknownst to Trent, Sasha is sexually involved with Phoenix and can't say no. When she finally tries to end the affair, it turns out to be a dangerous decision. <br />Threesome is a page-turner that gives a glimpse of the fast life of professional athletes. At the same time it presents the interesting perspective of \\"the other woman.\\" The biggest plus is the author's characterization of Sasha. Readers will love her or hate her and will certainly question \\"what is going on with this lady?

She evaluates the ?unsuccessful? lives of herself and her friends as her ex comes back to gloat before the woman he never stopped loving and her judgmental friends.<br />Siplin writes in blow-by-blow motion that makes no to attempt to create a world for the reader, but rather states things as-a-matter-of-factly and leaves the rest up to the reader?s imagination.  Her talents are so great that she is able to do this and allow the words and motion to convey strong tensions and emotions between and within the characters.  However, because of this writing style, some of the pivotal characters, namely Amy, Nick, and Gary, do not come off the page and tend to blend into one another or do not come across as uniquely as they possibly could.<br />Such A Girl is a moderately paced thought provoking novel as well as a subtle love story.  This minimal drama story is a great alternative read from a writer with a highly distinctive and enchanting voice in fiction<br />Readincolor Reviewers<BR>Cherlyn Michaels	2004-03-23

Not only is Raymo Queenie's male counterpart, he is hopelessly in love with her, and goes out of his way to show her his affection.

I also found that Kareem's character was not fully developed and thereby a great love story was lost because of this.

Kevin Davis gets beaten to a pulp on more than one occasion, James apologizes, and then Kevin apologizes for saying or doing things to provoke James. After the beatings, James buys Kevin expensive gifts to try and make up for his behavior. Why does Kevin allow James to continually abuse him mentally, physically, and sexually? <br />Kevin Davis met James the day he was planning to commit suicide. James stops him from doing so, and an emotional attachment is formed between the two. Kevin is confused. He is grieving over the loss of his twin brother, Keevan, whom he betrayed in the worst way. But before he has the chance to beg his brother's forgiveness, his brother is found dead, apparently from an asthma attack. Kevin feels responsible for his brother's death, because he forgot to drop off Keevan's medication to him before he leaves town for some fun. <br />The supporting cast in the book add nice touches to Kevin's character. The book is told from the main character's point of view and the other characters never overshadow the main character. There's Darryl, who openly lets it be known he's in love with Kevin, and there's Tony and Danea, who round out the foursome of friends. There's Croix, who shows Kevin there's more to life than what James has to offer, there's RaChelle Roland, Kevin's old college classmate, who manages to seduce Kevin, and then there's LaMont, Tony's love interest.<br />Once Kevin lets his friends know the real deal regarding his abusive relationship, they convince him to leave, but his leaving doesn't make James happy. He vows to get Kevin back at all cost. To make matters worse, Kevin and Darryl get together and this is too much for James to bear. But how far is James willing to go to get Kevin back? Will Kevin be seduced back to James or will he finally take a stand to recapture his life. <br />Hayes takes you on an emotional journey in his debut novel. You laugh at and you laugh with Kevin and of course Tony. You cry with and you cry for Kevin as he struggles to find himself. Will Kevin prevail in his attempt to reclaim his life and find true love or as the saying goes, once a victim always a victim, will Kevin let himself fall victim to James Lancaster over and again? <br />I found the storyline very convincing and real-life. I work in law enforcement, and I have witnessed victims of abuse behave in the same manner as Kevin does; making excuses for the abuser, taking the blame for provoking the act, and/or forgiving the abuser time and again. I also know firsthand when you lose a love one, it can cause you to carry around a lot of misplaced guilt. It's so easy to feel weak and have low self-esteem when you're burdened by life's heartaches. If you have no problem reading about gay relationships, then this book is for you. But be warned, this book is filled with graphic violence and graphic sex acts. I highly recommend Passion Marks to anyone looking for a riveting read. <br />Vanessa Johnson<BR>Readincolor Reviewers	2004-03-05

Dickey's name has become almost synonymous with \\"drama\\" as all of his novels have had the potent ingredient: relationship conflict, a.k.a drama. However, with The Other Woman, Dickey has challenged himself as an author to go beyond his normal recipe for a good book. With this novel, he chose to really stimulate the reader's literary palate with extra spices and several interesting twists.<br />The main character, known only as \\"Freckles\\" works as a television producer and is the epitome of a career woman. She's always \\"on duty\\" working nights and weekends, but loves her husband Charles, a handsome schoolteacher. With the exception of a hectic work schedule, \\"Freckles\\" has a seemingly normal life and a pretty good marriage. However, when a stranger named David Lawrence keeps calling the station and her cell phone in attempts to reach her, the \\"normal life\\" picture becomes cloudy. Finally when she actually speaks to Mr. Lawrence he reveals that his wife Jessica has been having an affair with her husband, Charles. For clarification, Freckles asks, \\"What is your name again?\\"<br />\\"David Lawrence\\"<br />\\"And your wife is...\\"<br />\\"F___ing your husband\\" (page 35)<br />And so begins a really bad day.<br />In a state of shock and disbelief, Freckles immediately leaves work and rushes home to confront her husband. After going from throwing around blame to being remorseful, Charles admits to his \\"mistake\\" and quickly adds that it is over. Although the marriage seems to be unraveling, Charles wants things to go back to the way they once were. Freckles, like an investigative reporter, wants the explicit details.<br />In a fit of rage, she tries to leave, backing her car out of the garage while the garage door is closed. Her best friend Yvette comes to her rescue. After drinking a kamikaze mixture of liquor and smoking\\"magical vegetation\\" Freckles finds herself calling David Lawrence. The next day, on a quest to find out more information about her husband's affair, she agrees to meet with David. Surprised by his good looks and his eclectic artist persona, Freckles is somehow drawn to David. Sooner than later, the two have passionate, revenge sex. But this is not the only twist in this interesting web of deception. How the events transpire will leave readers spellbound.<br />David brings out the musician in Freckles while plans of revenge take their course. Jessica and Charles have a secret between them, but it is a secret that not everyone involved can handle, bringing the novel to a tragic, unpredictable end.<br />With emotionally charged characters and staccato-style passages Dickey has created a deliciously, memorable tale. Some readers may be put off by a nameless character. However, this is simply another one of Dickey's steps away from the normal recipe. If you're not afraid to try something a little different, this novel will leave your reading appetite extremely satisfied. In fact, you'll be wanting dessert.<br />Joan Burke Stanford,<BR>Readincolor Reviewers	2004-02-26

She has an angelic voice, but her battle with the bulge leads her to shy away from her dream of being a professional singer. Reina's life takes a turn when she gets into a fight with her brother, her father slaps her and she moves out of her parents' home and in with Vanessa. After some soul searching, a talk with her grandmother, a blind date and some weight loss, she finds her true self and the man of her dreams.<br />Vanessa eats healthy and exercises to maintain her perfect body. She owns a home and does well in her career. But the one thing she's missing is family. Vanessa grew up in foster homes and desperately wants to find her birth parents. To make matters worse, she cannot seem to land a decent man. In fact, it seems that she looks for Mr. Wrong when Mr. Right might be right beneath her nose. When she gets information that may lead to her birth parents, she excitedly travels cross country to follow up on the lead.

In addition, Harrison sometimes sporadically throws in vocabulary words that do not fit the tone of the dialogue. However, Harrison does a good job of presenting faith-based lessons without being overbearing.<br />With well developed characters and a sprinkle of humor, LIVING ON THE EDGE OF RESPECTABILITY is a solid read.<br />Readincolor Reviewers<BR>Joan	2004-02-05

Morgana is shaken to the core when her mother dies unexpectedly. Calling her husbands uptown apartment to share her grief, she receives another shock as a female answers the phone. <br />In turmoil over the loss of her mother and her husband's adultery, she heads home to Salvation, Georgia. With the help of her uncle, she put her mother's affairs in order. Packing away memories of the past, she stumbles onto her mother's diary, which brings to life secrets from the past. As Morgana reads the diary, her life is turned upside down. Soon Morgana must answer the same question her mother asked: Is her marriage worth fighting for?<br />I enjoyed the novel as a whole, but I did not think it was one of Rochelle's best works. The character of Morgana and especially her husband could have been developed more. At times moving between and present was a bit confusing. The ending was somewhat predictable and could have been developed more. I would recommend the book for the marvelously mature audience. <br />Sylvia	2004-01-16
