I know there was supposed to be a message behind it, about feminism and Christianity, which could be true. But the rest of it, where is that coming from? It's just like some bargain basement historical romance.	2001-11-08

I could never seem to find it anywhere before, but I did and I'm glad, having now read all of Mrs Gaskells novels.  Before I started reading I had a look over the chapter  titles and after reading the first few chapters I had an idea of what would  happen.  There is a chapter called 'Nursing Mr Bellingham' and I began to  suspect the story would be simialr to that of 'Sylvia's Lovers'.  Mr  Bellingham would have some proper excuse (being sick maybe?), then Ruth  would meet up with him again after years of seperation.  He would die, and  then she. Of course I was wrong.  We've had single motherhood in the 19th  century before, with Adam Bede and Tess of the D'Urbervilles, but in  neither of these cases did we see the children surviving.  Although Ruth is  hidden behind a widow's identity we know how people would disown her if her  secret was revealed.  And when it is we see the hypocrisy of those  condemning her. And Mr Donne disappears without any of our sympathy.	2000-07-07

The literary critic (ha!) in me tells me I shouldn't give this 5 stars, but who cares.  this was a sweet, I suppose kind of old-fashioned book.  The story is quite implausible, and the whole Romanov thing is ridiculous,  I think she should have left that out.  but anyway, forgetting all that,  it's a nice happy ever after story, and you just love reading about how  Daisy finds her place with Alex and with everyone else.

I read the first chapter once, found it interesting, but I wasn't compelled to read any more, as there didn't seem to be going anywhere.  But  next time I came across it I read it all at once, and was fascinated.  It  was the first book I've ever read where I immediately began to reread it  right from the beginning.  The more you read of the book, the more falls  into place, and then when you read it again you notice things you didn't  notice properly before.  Every sentence is important, and yet I don't think  it should be read, paying close attention to details, as it can take away  from the whole.  Highly recommended.	2000-07-05

Each girl experiences different hardships and joys and they  are not always able to help each other.  A holiday in Spain brings  everything out in the open. Perhaps it's not of any literary merit, but a  good read nonetheless.	2000-06-29

It and 'The Morning Gift' are Eva's best books.  Unfortunately I haven't found it in English anywhere and have only read it in German, but I think the beauty of the story crosses the language  barrier.

It may sound cheesy, the idea of two people, already married to each other, falling in love.  But it's not.  The book is really romantic and yet not  harlequin.  Other authors try to make their book seem more cultured by  references to famous authors or musicians and fail.  Eva Ibbotson manages  to pull this off effortlessly.  I never wanted to put this book down, and  it seemed to end too soon.	2000-06-29

I did suspect the criminal, as I suspected everyone else in turn.   And it was so superbly written, I had it read in one night.  You don't  have to be a fan of detective novels to read this.

Other authors might not have had the courage to continue and show the realities and the hardships that people  like Kevin and Sadie had to face.

I'm usually a big fan of so-called classics.  I didn't like the three musketeers much, but I hated this.  After TTM I wouldn't  really have been pushed to read any more Dumas, but I saw two film versions  and wondered how they could be so different.  Now I see that it's because  TMITIM doesn't really deal with the king and his brother at all.  Just  another story about those musketeers. And it really is such a good idea.  I  usually never recommend this, but watch one of the films (I love the oldest  one) instead of reading the book. Maybe if I had read it a little slower, I  might have found it more easy to read, but I was eager to get to the end  and find out what happened to Philippe and Louis, and was very disappointed  when they weren't mentioned.	1999-11-24
