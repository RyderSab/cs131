US	52793993	R3OS3RCAUABI9U	1400043085	468189384	Cast of Shadows	Books	3	24	29	N	N	Fabulous Idea, Spotty Execution, But Worth a Look	I'm a sucker for certain types of commercial bait - a review that compares a pop record favorably to a transitional Beatles record like \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper's,\\" or a jazz record to \\"Kind of Blue\\" or \\"Saxophone Colossus,\\" or a novelist to \\"Faulkner\\" or \\"Roth.\\" What got me on to Kevin Guilfoile's Cast of Shadows was a reviewer's approving nod to \\"this modern-day Frankenstein tale\\" - a line that summoned up Ur-resonances within me that have jangled through my neural system since first fired in a movie theater 50 years ago. (That comparison, it turns out, was apparently concocted by a Knopf publicist and eagerly grabbed up by several hook-hungry, imagination-deprived book \\"critics.\\")<br /><br />So that's how I have the book in my hands.<br /><br />For the first 100 pages or so, I found the story of fertility specialist Davis Moore, his murdered daughter, his slipping marriage and slow-fuse relationship with an attractive female  colleague, and his hope-against-hope plan to clone his daughter's murderer slow going but plausible, with cloning, its politics, and its ethical and religious implications interestingly evoked and explored. Strangely, as the pace picked up and little Justin Finn's development is chronicled, the book began gliding into implausibility - in Guilfoile's near-future Chicago, pace and plausibility seem inversely related. There were more key coincidences than a Dickens novel, more than a fair share of character-motivation issues, and an epic 20-year time span that seems disproportionate to the book's preoccupations, which, although weighty, are distinctly less than epic. This is, at bottom, a futuristic murder mystery.<br /><br />By the time I was in the second hundred pages, however, I was not only invested in the story but hooked: I was rooting for Guilfoile, wanting the book to work for its daring to take up difficult ethical and philosophical themes - regardless of the hard time the author had in finding the literary voice for such exposition (sometimes a neat aside, other times a clunky lecture, but generally striking a good rhetorical balance). I thought Justin, the cloned boy, an absorbing, complex, believable character, and I liked the way Guilfoile used the \\"Shadow World\\" computer-game subtext that, with the exponential information-technology advances of the past decade, seemed the least contrived element of a storyline I suspect Guilfoile felt forced to \\"over-contrive.\\"<br /><br />Knowing he had a nice idea, Guilfoile also knew he needed a lengthy fictional timespan to play it out -  at least 300 pages for two decades and a fuller, more populated world. He thus invented a large cast of characters, some of whom do the heavy literary lifting across long spans of time (but who in that long stretch generally undergo little change). Many others comprise a long list of \\"fifth business\\" types who matter very little, and appear very briefly, but whom Guilfoile makes essential in one way or another to advancing his story. With all this, and despite its bursts of energy, Cast of Shadows struck me as a fairly long 320 page book that during my beach week had me flipping back and forth in keeping the Jackies and Joans and Sallies and Marthas straight.<br /><br />Among the book's considerable attractions, however, is Guilfoile's literary deftness. He observes closely, sees things at an odd angle, and turns a handsome descriptive line. For instance, \\"He liked to grip a book with both hands, as if the knowledge were entering through his fingers instead of his eyes\\" to describe the precocious Justin's intense preference for hardcovers over paperbacks. And Guilfoile dares to ruminate on philosophical themes - he has a clear eye for the ethical issues surrounding fertility and abortion, enjoys parsing them, and has a taste for the Great Books and the eternal moral questions, references to which are sprinkled throughout his book. Yes, he's capable of producing a howler or two - how about \\"The words drilled into his heart and uncorked a gusher of rage\\"? And he sometimes likes to overdescribe the inconsequential - \\"He let a sip of Shiraz trickle down the back of his throat.\\" Consider such passages a first-time novelist's entitlement of Mulligans (and hope for a more attentive editor next time around). Guilfoile can write.<br /><br />Cast of Shadows isn't Frankenstein (although The Modern Prometheus theme is front and center), and Guilfoile isn't Mary Shelley, but he's ambitious in much the same way, and his book is worthy: a clear cut above most summer fare - more literary and cerebral than the average thriller, daring to take on large moral and religious themes, leading the reader to weigh serious issues that we may indeed find ourselves grappling with in not too long a time, but still with a measure of thrills and ingenious twists...and a conclusion I found quite satisfying. I don't think Cast of Shadows will haunt my imagination, but I have no difficulty recommending it for late-summer reading lists.nd he sometimes likes to overdescribe the inconsequential - \\"He let a sip of Shiraz trickle down the back of his throat.\\" Consider such passages a first-time novelist's entitlement of Mulligans (and hope for a more attentive editor next time around).

But this strangeness is treated so matter-of-factly that any disorientation we might be experiencing, any intellectual vertigo, must be a result of our simply missing the author's wavelength.  To get onto that wavelength, however, requires only that we persevere, keep reading, and that, with our progress deeper in, as the fat block of pages in our right hand diminishes and become a fact block of pages in the left, we inch into a strange-but-familiar world that recalls - it slowly dawned on me - the matter-of-fact strangeness of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Salman Rushdie, and other writers toiling in the domain of \\"magical realism.\\"  Ms. Clarke does not call attention to the effect she is working; she simply writes, on and on, in a style that alternates between a straightforward, almost reportorial, mid-19th century descriptive clarity reminiscent of Wilkie Collins and an inventive and lapidary beauty that is wholly unique in its power of \\"observation\\" - for it observes things that in our much less strange world cannot be - and strikingly curlicued descriptions of the marvelous.  The great possess such powers as Ms. Clarke displays and, in fairness, we must admit that Ms. Clarke dons greatness here.<br /><br />One has to marvel at the patience Ms. Clarke exhibits. She will not be rushed into her story (and, as a result, many impatient readers and reviewers have flung the dictionary-sized tome across the room, never to be lifted again).  It is a pity that our reading culture no longer supports the serialization of long, segmented novels - except for a rare Tom Wolfe-Rolling Stone collaboration - to be consumed in bite-sized pieces.  I'm surmising that readers who couldn't get through the first 200 pages would tool along nicely at a 40-page-per-month clip.<br /><br />And what would such patience gain?  Above all, Ms. Clarke's marvelous, richly drawn and detailed characters.  And apart from those of the title, whom I found wholly convincing, she has created the formidable John Uskglass, the \\"Raven King\\" who ruled the north of England for 300 during the Middle Ages and who has, in Ms. Clarke's hands, the sheer physical quiddity of a historical personality, whose name sent me and countless others off on library and Google searches for the real Uskglass . . . only to come up empty.  He is purely Ms. Clarke's invention, and one more reason to be in her debt.<br /><br />And she has invented so much more than she had space to use.  Hence the footnotes, and more footnotes, and still more, which one can either love or hate but will skip at peril to their own pleasure.  Because Ms. Clarke is a fabulously funny spinner of yarns, and many of her funniest stories are loaded into long footnotes that sometimes stretch across several pages. The hilarious \\"Story of the Master of Nottingham's Daughter,\\" which begins on p. 240, could have been pulled directly out of Grimm, or an otherworldly Chaucer, but is found in an immense four-page footnote I'll bet many readers passed on. In truth, I found the footnotes exasperating; I read them all; but like the copious footnotes in Gibbon, you don't really need them - that's why they're footnotes. But they create the cumulative effect of an \\"alternate book\\" - in this case, The Great Book of English Magic - that should not be missed.  I did, however, grind my teeth in the last hundred pages, when the story is hurtling toward its conclusion, each time Ms. Clarke throws a log-of-a-footnoted aside or two (or three, or four) into the road, utterly disrupting the momentum.  (At these times, I skipped, and returned at an appropriate caesura in the main text.)<br /><br />But this is but a quibble in the context of the great pleasures this book affords.  I loved Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, its bookish world, its swirling mists and vapours and diffuse light andsoft edges, and I look forward to the sequel(s), resolved to follow Ms. Clarke through whatever door she cares to open for me.e light and soft edges, and I look forward to the sequel(s), resolved to follow Ms. Clarke through whatever door she cares to open for me. <br />	2004-11-25

Ian McEwan freezes our attention on the grotesque, then renders grotesquerie plausible, even \\"normal.\\"  Indeed, what is \\"natural\\" assumes an expanded range of possibility in McEwan's writing, adding fresh dimension to psychological horror. The Cement Garden, his first novel (and better described as a novella), brings these observations graphically to life, in precise, crystalline prose.<br /><br />The Cement Garden has been likened to Golding's Lord of the Flies for its careful evocation of a society of young people, suddenly relieved of adult oversight, that evolves rapidly, opportunistically, organically in response to specific challenges posed by an unusual environment. In McEwan's working of these materials, related in the flat, dispassionate voice of Jack, the 14-year-old narrator, the challenging environment is the solitary house in which Jack, his brother, and two sisters live, set in the midst of a desolate urban landscape cleared for a freeway that never gets built.<br /><br />The book takes its name from the paved-over garden Jack's fussy, acerbic father, a heart patient, envisions as tidier as easier to maintain. The exertions of the project kill the father, to no one's apparent regret, in the first chapter, leaving a sizable inventory of cement behind. With the demise of their long ailing mother shortly thereafter, the orphaned children are forced to recreate the family unit.  Fearful of the split-up of the family, foster care for little Tom, and other worrisome ministrations of an impersonal state, the children decide to tell no one of their mother's death and to entomb her in concrete in the basement.<br /><br />Jack recounts these and other details, and the changes each child undergoes, in his matter-of-fact voice. McEwan charges his tale with an extraordinary measure of sexual tension, primarily between Jack - much more than the stereotypically acne-covered, pubescent, serially self-abusing \\"sullen teen\\" - and his beautiful, athletic older sister Julia, who assumes the maternal role of \\"Wendy\\" to the family's \\"lost children.\\" The movement of the story is aided and abetted by Derek, Julia's \\"bloke,\\" a professional snooker player, aking all the questions the nosey private eye in a Hitchcock picture usually asks. The dreaded resolution of the relentlessly rising tension, carefully withheld until the closing pages, relieves narrative pressure but raises disturbing perspectives on love, the family, the \\"ties that bind.\\"<br /><br />The Cement Garden renews, at least in my mind, the great question of what it is that prompts a lavishly gifted writer to explore so sensitively the wholly bizarre.  Great writing generally works simultaneously at several levels and admits layers of meaning. McEwan writes about familiar characters who before our eyes become something very, very different. He begs us to inquire beneath the surface familiarity into worlds unseen by, or denied to, passing spectators. He compels us to ask ourselves \\"what is `normal'?\\"  \\"What is `natural'?\\" His answers may unsettle, but they are are the product of a novelistic logic that, in its internal workings, is eminently reasonable.<br /><br />The Cement Garden is assuredly not for every taste. More than once, I looked up from the page with an \\"ugh.\\" McEwan's imagination teems with clambering spiders. But as an early example of McEwan's art and his project to redefine, or reinvent, the psychological horror story, this book is a worthy, if unsettling, read.ternal role of \\"Wendy\\" to the family's \\"lost children.\\" The movement of the story is aided and abetted by Derek, Julia's \\"bloke,\\" a professional snooker player, aking all the questions the nosey private eye in a Hitchcock picture usually asks.

US	52793993	R1GOEB1HE2O9SH	1594200092	686377339	Alexander Hamilton	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Hamilton and Political Contingency in the Early Republic	As the 2004 Republican National Convention convenes in the Big Apple, this year has witnessed something of a Hamilton Revival, with a major exhibition by the New York Historical Society - \\"Alexander Hamilton:  The Man Who Made Modern America\\" - and Ron Chernow's compelling biography, which justifies in brilliant strokes the NYHS claim.<br /><br />Let me say at the outset that Chernow writes with a novelist's flair for narrative and language - he aspired to fiction before becoming an honored biographer - and he is able to invest the most arid topics, such as the struggle over federal assumption of state-incurred Revolutionary War debt, with thrilling pace amid the detail necessary to keep the complicated story straight. Chernow's narrative structure is usefully abetted by a full contingent of familiar heroes and villains, with George Washington towering among the former and similarly marble-empillared figures like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison among the latter (in addition, of course, to Aaron Burr).  (Indeed, if Chernow can be called out on any failing, it is that he so wholly assumes the Hamilitonian-Federalist point of view that he risks distorting the case for, and the behavior of, Hamilton's Republican foes, thereby reversing the tables on a generation of Jefferson idolaters.)<br /><br />What makes this biography so gripping is the impression Chernow creates, like so many contemporary historians of The Founding, of the essential fact that \\"it might have been otherwise.\\" He gives us a particularly sharp sense of the contingency of political life and of the stakes for which the founders fought. Hamilton was present at many of the most significant junctures of our early history: in the Revolutionary War (as Washington's trusted aide and ghost-author), in the Constitutional Debate (as participant and author of two-thirds of the Federalist Papers), and in the founding of the Federal Government (as Washington's Secretary of Treasury).  At each step, against significant resistance, Hamilton shapes precedent and then history. In many instances, he fired the first salvoes in a national debate that rages to this day - over urban versus rural economy, the size and servicing of the national debt, broad-based versus narrowly construed taxation schemes, national supremacy versus \\"states rights,\\" and a strong standing army and activist foreign policy in advance of commercial inroads abroad versus a quiescent, isolationist policy.  Hamilton was also an early abolitionist, which helped fix his quarrels with Virginians Jefferson and Madison.<br /><br />Many readers may not share my particular fondness for the ins and outs of Colonial and Federalist period intellectual history, but those who do will find Chernow scrimps on a necessary story: the British wellsprings of the era's politics. Britain appears throughout as either the most promising friend or the demonic monarchical foe of the new American republic, but seldom as the source of ideas that drove the \\"Whiggish\\" Jeffersonian opposition to Hamilton's Federalist designs. Apart from the case of Hamilton's ideas on the regulation of national debt, which Chernow is careful to source to British example, you will have to go to Bernard Bailyn, Gordon Wood, Joseph Ellis, and their followers for the origins of American politics (and particularly for the fondness of 19th Century men for conspiratorial explanations of individual behavior - to me one of the most remarkable and signature perceptions of the era).<br /><br />But insofar as well-wrought biography can capture the man along with his era, Chernow succeeds admirably.  In doing so, he renders Hamilton a tragic figure of classical proportion, ultimately brought down by his pride (in his own rightness, political and moral correctness, and his \\"too-smart-for-his-own-good\\" intellect- and perhaps his assumption that Burr would never really shoot to kill. This of a man who has been  termed \\"the Father of our Government.\\"<br /><br />Chernow has given us full-blooded history, biography, and writing - and a book that simply could not be more timely.biography, and writing - and a book that simply could not be more timely.	2004-09-02
US	52793993	R3N29ADSHPHOIY	0060677015	51378391	The Rise of Christianity: How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries	Books	5	164	172	N	N	Revelatory. Really. Read This.	This is the mystery of two millennia, right?  How does an obscure sect led by an executed convict go from less than 100 adherents to an estimated 6 million on the eve on Constantine's &#34;conversion&#34; in the early fourth century?<br /><br />Social scientist Rodney Stark did more than puzzle: he created a set of testable hypotheses and tried, via secondary literature (he reads no ancient language and disclaims any expertise in the traditional scholarship of early church history), to probe the key issues.  Along the way, he uses contemporary social science findings from demography, the sociology of small groups, the psychology of conversion, medical statistics, and every other conceptual lever he could divine to create a compelling mosaic of findings, arrayed in discrete topical chapters (each of which had a former life as a scholarly article).<br /><br />Others have pointed out, as does Stark himself, that his work is a strictly scientific enterprise: his own religious views are for himself. he is a sociologist of religion.  He gives respectful attention to the historical record of the early church, which consists almost exclusively of the well-known testaments from the early church -New Testament accounts, non-canonic letters and gospels, and works by Eusebius, Tertullian, and their peers. But in the end, the &#34;miracle&#34; of the expansion of the early church seems explicable by a number of readily understandable facts and processes.<br /><br />For example, the forty percent growth rate per decade from 30 CE to 300 CE, which arithmetically gets one from 40 converts to 6 million, seems virtually miraculous - until Stark compares this rate to the growth achieved by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - the Mormons - which in the past century has averaged just over 40 percent per decade.  In separate chapters, Stark also sheds fresh light on the geographic spread of Christianity, the success - rather than the long presumed failure - of &#34;mission to the Hebrews,&#34; the role of plagues and natural disasters as facilitators of the Christian mission, Christian conversion as an urban phenomenon, the comparative socioeconomic advantages of Christianity versus &#34;paganism&#34; in the &#34;religious marketplace&#34; of antiquity, and the &#34;rationality&#34; of martyrdom, the last of which contains more than a few startlingly relevant observations in the current context of terrorist martyrdom.<br /><br />Throughout, the emphasis returns again and again to social networks - friends converting friends, wives converting husbands, former Jewish co-religionists converting other Jews as Christian churches establish themselves in the &#34;Jewish Quarters&#34; of Roman towns and cities, mercy-bound Christians staying to care for plague victims while pagans flee the pandemic.<br /><br />Some chapters, needless to say, are less compelling than others.  Stark's fascinating discussion the allure of Christianity to the wholly disenfranchised women of the Roman empire, and of the advantages conferred to women in the early church, stands at odds with persuasive accounts - say, those of Elaine Pagels in The Gnostic Gospels or Bart Ehrman in Lost Christianities - of the steady hostility toward the role of women in the church and in the canonic New Testament accounts.<br /><br />This is a minor quibble.  Stark has given us a necessary book - for believers, skeptics, pastors, and laypeople - that, in conception alone, is the stuff of genius.  And - whipped cream on top - the author has serious journalistic chops, honed in a former life as a newspaperman, that make him that rare social scientist who can actually communicate his findings crystal-clearly to an intelligent reader.

US	52793993	R2PIZ3SVLM44T0	0174434693	43217624	Hamlet (The Arden Edition of the Works of William Shakespeare)	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Simply Indispensable	When Henry James sat down to write on his Venetian travels for what later became the Italian Hours, he began with a disclaimer: &#34;It is a great pleasure to write the word; but I am not sure there is not a certain impudence in pretending to add anything to it.&#34; Turning to Shakespeare, we might amuse ourselves by writing on, say, Hamlet, but can anything be said that's not already been said, and better, a dozen times, by superior critics and closer readers? In the appropriate spirit of humility (and in utter submission to the Bard and his great gift to civilization), I offer a few thoughts on the Arden 2nd Edition of Hamlet, and not on &#34;the greatest work in the history of literature.&#34;<br /><br />Hamlet is by far the longest of the Ardens at 574 pages. It breaks down thusly: the prefatory material of editor Harold Jenkins - one of the Arden Series general editors and a Hamlet authority of great renown - alone takes up 164 pages. Three-quarters of this is bibliographical and historical. In his 40-page critical introduction, Jenkins addresses many of the plays thorniest problems, with the Talmudic attentiveness of the closest reader. Then comes the play itself, spread over 264 pages (in terms of sheer length relative to the Bard's other plays, the text is a monster, coming in at more than 3800 lines). Each page of the Arden includes an average half-page of Jenkins' detailed, argumentative, authoritative, and uncommonly helpful footnotes. The final 146 pages consist of longer (end)notes that Jenkins simply could not physically fit onto the bottom of a page. Many of these are short essays (including an appendix that glosses an earlier discussion on the dating of the play).<br /><br />Each of the Arden Hamlet's three sections might merit separate publication (after a modest bit of repackaging), but as a totality, Jenkins' edition must be the greatest value on the Shakespeare market. Jenkins' ruminations on the provenance of the story and the many sources Shakespeare might have drawn on, the &#34;Ur-Hamlet&#34; that might have come from the quill of contemporary Thomas Kyd (The Spanish Tragedy), the complexities of determining an authoritative text, the drama's inconsistencies and unanswered questions, the import of the great soliloquy of III.i (which is emphatically NOT, insists Jenkins, a deliberation on whether to commit suicide), Elizabethan revenge dramas in general, and so much more make this a truly indispensable, illuminating, even breathtaking volume.<br /><br />We think we know this play well. We have read it, and seen performed on stage and in memorable or hideously forgettable films. Many of its greatest lines are embedded in our hearts. The beginning of true understanding, however, resides in a superbly annotated scholarly edition. The Arden is one of several choices you can make and is for me the one to own, equally suitable for students, scholars, actors, and mere Bardolators. It will - provided, of course, you are not already a scholarly specialist in Elizabethan drama - knock the scales from your eyes. And until the 3rd edition now in preparation under Ann Thompson is published, this Hamlet will stand as the epitome of the Arden Shakespeare's greatness as a series.rawn on, the &#34;Ur-Hamlet&#34; that might have come from the quill of contemporary Thomas Kyd (The Spanish Tragedy), the complexities of determining an authoritative text, the drama's inconsistencies and unanswered questions, the import of the great soliloquy of III.i (which is emphatically NOT, insists Jenkins, a deliberation on whether to commit suicide), Elizabethan revenge dramas in general, and so much more make this a truly indispensable, illuminating, even breathtaking volume.

US	52793993	R10UXP3TS263XK	0312315732	860060808	Little Children: A Novel	Books	4	1	2	N	N	There's Nothing at the End of the Rainbow	So sings the great contemporary troubadour, Richard Thompson, whose song title rings like a commentary on Tom Perrotta's wry, angular, strangely gripping Little Children, perhaps the most peculiar thriller this side of, oh, Ian McEwan.<br /><br />I say peculiar because Perrotta has assembled a compendium of male, mostly sexual, anxieties, given them names and histories, and melded them into four-fifths of a cracking good novel. And although the McEwan comparison is admittedly a stretch, long passages of Little Children induced physiological effects upon me, in my stomach, in particular, in much the same way McEwan does.<br /><br />But Perrotta's palette is considerably brighter, positively Turneresque: all sunlight, radiant colors and blinding whites. Perrotta is, moreover, a satirist of effortless comic abundance. When I wasn't all knotted up, and even when I was, I smiled . . . and laughed loudly, it seemed, every third or fourth page (at one point, I confess, startling a sleeping spouse). An unusual thriller indeed.<br /><br />Everyone in Perrotta's Boston suburb is afflicted with the American disease: the pursuit of happiness - an American birthright - unfulfilled. Even the toddlers are disgruntled and, as a result, disagreeably demanding. Like Mom and Dad. Because the kids aren't the novel's eponymous \\"little children.\\" These, you had to have known, are the \\"adults\\"--the parents, neighbors, and even new neighbor Ronnie, a convicted and now released child molester, perhaps worse, who adds a jittery element to the local chemistry. No one here can really seem to get any satisfaction in or out of their connubial relations and would-be attachments.<br /><br />Out of this Perrotta devises several paths down which his couples seek to work out their own human salvations. Perrotta has, I'm afraid, got men, their motives, and particularly male narcissism fairly well figured out. And like Nick Hornby, to whom one reviewer has compared him, Perrotta writes women with an observant and sympathetic eye. When the not-so-pretty Sarah scrutinizes every inch of herself in a mirror, wondering if she can be a suitable lover for Todd-the-Sensitive-Prom-King-Blond-Jock-God, you ache for her - and perhaps for your own homely self - in the center of your chest.<br /><br />Little Children, like Perrota's other books, falls between genres. He's not literary but is unusually perceptive, and he gets respectful reviews and spots on the \\"notable books\\" lists, largely for his honest, effortlessly fluent writing, sharp dialogue, and plainly recorded insights into real men and women. He's genuinely funny and knows how to pace a tale.<br /><br />The uncommonly clever patter and elements of tension almost obscure the fact that Perrotta's cast is a tad too carefully assembled from what must be a very conventional set of \\"character notes\\" - or is simply dropped in from central casting: the bombshell, the loudmouth, the tightass, the artist wannabe, the Redford, the creep. (Okay - \\"the creep\\" is very, very good, almost Rothian, a real 21st century type, \\"the horny websurfer,\\" who is the protagonist of one of the book's most hilarious moments.) To Perrotta's credit, there's some overlap, and the characters pick up a measure of complexity. But we remain on familiar--albeit brightly illumined--ground here, and we sense a patness that doesn't have to be.<br /><br />That said, and despite a disappointing sag as Perrotta wraps up over the final 30 pages or so - from which judgment I exclude a fine closing paragraph - I could not set this book aside. It pulled me along like a tractor beam. Thus do I very easily recommend Little Children, and his The Wishbones (a Jersey wedding band! For me, terra cognita), and Election (which many of you will know, if only for the film). Do Sarah and Todd live happily ever after? It's worth an evening to find out.with an observant and sympathetic eye. When the not-so-pretty Sarah scrutinizes every inch of herself in a mirror, wondering if she can be a suitable lover for Todd-the-Sensitive-Prom-King-Blond-Jock-God, you ache for her - and perhaps for your own homely self - in the center of your chest. <br /> <br />Little Children, like Perrota's other books, falls between genres. He's not literary but is unusually perceptive, and he gets respectful reviews and spots on the \\"notable books\\" lists, largely for his honest, effortlessly fluent writing, sharp dialogue, and plainly recorded insights into real men and women. He's genuinely funny and knows how to pace a tale.  <br /> <br />The uncommonly clever patter and elements of tension almost obscure the fact that Perrotta's cast is a tad too carefully assembled from what must be a very conventional set of \\"character notes\\" - or is simply dropped in from central casting: the bombshell, the loudmouth, the tightass, the artist wannabe, the Redford, the creep. (Okay - \\"the creep\\" is very, very good, almost Rothian, a real 21st century type, \\"the horny websurfer,\\" who is the protagonist of one of the book's most hilarious moments.) To Perrotta's credit, there's some overlap, and the characters pick up a measure of complexity. But we remain on familiar--albeit brightly illumined--ground here, and we sense a patness that doesn't have to be. <br /> <br />That said, and despite a disappointing sag as Perrotta wraps up over the final 30 pages or so - from which judgment I exclude a fine closing paragraph - I could not set this book aside. It pulled me along like a tractor beam. Thus do I very easily recommend Little Children, and his The Wishbones (a Jersey wedding band! For me, terra cognita), and Election (which many of you will know, if only for the film). Do Sarah and Todd live happily ever after? It's worth an evening to find out.	2004-05-22

Dickens is, with Victoria, the archetypical Victorian, and he is here fully realized, in all his contradictory dimensions: the best-known and best-loved writer of his day, but perpetually insecure and ashamed of his \\"ungentlemanly\\" background; wealthy yet financially ever insecure and working feverishly for material advancement; outgoing and flamboyantly dramatic, yet profoundly interior and haunted by irrepressible demons; the great celebrator of hearth and home who sired 10 children but who abandoned his wife of 22 years for a curious relationship with an actress less than half his age; the man who toasted Shakespeare's birthday as the anniversary also of the Bard's gallery of immortal characters, who saw himself as a similar progenitor but who would \\"write\\" his friends, compulsively objectifying them, family, and acquaintances into manipulable, construed, understandable \\"characters\\" - indeed, the most capacious literary imagination since Shakespeare but a jittery control addict for whom everything, and everybody, had to be in its right place.<br /><br />Ackroyd has read every word Dickens wrote - the novels, stories, journalism, letters, inscriptions - and apparently, and more astonishingly, everything ever written ABOUT Dickens - by his circle of literary and profession friends, rivals, reviewers and critics, acquaintances, memoirists who encountered him but once, otherwise unknown British, Scottish, Continental, or American diarists who happened to note a Dickens \\"sighting\\" whether or not words were exchanged.  All these gleanings Ackroyd shapes convincingly into cumulative aspects of character, incidents that inform Dickens's work, information about the author's public bearing, mannerisms, speech, likes, dislikes, behavior in almost every imaginable range of situations - \\"in short\\" - to call on Micawber - a full portrait.  And with remarkable efficiency and literary felicity, Ackroyd situates Dickens within his rapidly changing era, as long-distance horse-drawn coaches give way to rail travel, as the stench and filth of pre-Reform London yields to reformist impulses of every stripe, as the Empire advances and London is transformed into a great capital of monuments and squares and Imperial architecture. (And, as with his engrossing biography of Thomas More, Ackroyd introduces London as a major character and influence on his subject, a conceit Ackroyd, himself the author of a knowing, loving \\"biography\\" of London, pulls off beautifully.)<br /><br />Most important for devotees of Charles Dickens - and if you're searching for a 1200 page (scandalously) out-of-print biography, you are surely that - Ackroyd demonstrates convincingly how the work reflects the life, the personality, the influences, the environment, and all the contradictions of Dickens the man.  Ackroyd carefully walks the line between reading too much into the life from the work, but draws careful correspondences between the tensions of the life and their realizations in fiction.  The chapters devoted to Dickens in the throes, or ecstasies, of creation - for so does his creative moods and energies vary - are among the book's most compelling passages.  Scarcely ever has the sinews of literary creativity been laid so believably bare, by a biographer who is himself a prolific, and highly imaginative, writer.  The most powerful impression one draws from Ackroyd's matchless story is the extent to which a protean Dickens embodied to a great degree all his mightiest creations, the dark and the bright, and not merely the plainly autobiographical Nickeby, Pip, and David Copperfield.<br /><br />When I finally closed Ackroyd's Dickens, I was nearly inconsolable at the loss of someone I felt I had come to know so well.  A brilliant life, radiantly told, and a book that deserves to be - and, I pray, will soon be - back in print.literary felicity, Ackroyd situates Dickens within his rapidly changing era, as long-distance horse-drawn coaches give way to rail travel, as the stench and filth of pre-Reform London yields to reformist impulses of every stripe, as the Empire advances and London is transformed into a great capital of monuments and squares and Imperial architecture.

US	52793993	R18LV7UV2GZMDJ	0375706852	127846038	My Name Is Red	Books	5	12	12	N	N	A Haunting, Haunted World, Beautifully Rendered	Pamuk's 16th Century Turkey is a magical world shot through with consciousness - all physical objects, natural and artificial, are invested with self-awareness, fully aroused, senses piqued and perceptively observant. Here we have \\"the mind\\" - the perfectly knowing, self-conscious thoughts - of coins, dogs, horses, painted dervishes, trees, the color Red, Death (personified and unpersonifed), and of an exuberant cast of unforgettable characters, both living and dead, whose insistent voices effortless cross over from the other side in Pamuk's seemingly borderless world of physical and spiritual Being. (Indeed, My Name Is Red begins, like Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, the narrator speaking to us from a watery grave.)<br /><br />A nickel's worth of dime-store aesthetics: one function of art is to elicit - through the creation of representations, the arrangement of symbols, and the like - sensations that might otherwise be impossible. I can never experience Ottoman Istanbul in its 16th Century context. I will never see with the eyes of a court miniaturist or illuminator of manuscripts or a courtier or a rag- or liver-seller. But Pamuk convincingly recreates these myriads of worlds in all their strangeness with the imagination and skill of an ethnologist who has lived among these lives for decades. Here is a unique world, and Orhan Pamuk the ideal tour guide.<br />With immense subtlety, literary nuance, and historical and philosophical erudition, Pamuk has written what, at its most fundamental level, is a literary-scholarly mystery that at times is reminiscent of Eco's The Name of the Rose. Someone is murdering the great miniaturists of the Ottoman court. But why kill an official painter or calligrapher, who works largely from royal commission, and who executes his commissions in a highly formalized manner that idealizes the absence of \\"style\\"? The world of Pamuk's late 16th Century Istanbul is one in which the pace of change is accelerating and colliding with entrenched forces of jealously preserved tradition. That world is nearly as exotic to contemporary Turks as it will be to us, and Pamuk (and his translator, Erdag Goknar) has a lot of explaining to do, which he manages by carefully assembling a painterly, almost pointillistic narrative, dab by dab, stroke by stroke, giving gradual shape to the story, displaying exemplary patience and timing, advancing or withholding plot and subplot with consummate skill.<br />My Name Is Red is also a monumental, and monumentally odd, love story, a tangled tale involving Pamuk's hero, \\"Black,\\" and Shekure, the impossibly beautiful daughter of the Court's \\"Head Illuminator,\\" as well as a host of other characters. My Name Is Red is, moreover, a formidable, forbidding book, filled with strange names and places and embedded tales from esoteric lands in faraway times, requiring considerable readerly patience and attention. In return for the effrontery of have made such demands, however, the author (and publisher) is bound by honor to provide rich rewards. Happily, Pamuk closes the deal. The familiar materials of the epic novel - love, hate, friendship, rivalry, loyalty and betrayal, political machinations, the clash of great ideas, the grinding together of tectonic movements of time, in which one side or the other must give way - are spectacularly worked in the dazzling, winding, dreamlike context of the Ottoman court.<br />For me, one long chapter at the heart of the novel captures perfectly the pervasive sense of the numinous that Orhan Pamuk casts in this beautiful novel. Black and the head illuminator receive extraordinary permission to search for clues within the inner sanctum and holiest of holies, the Royal Treasury. Their guide is an aged dwarf who knows the treasure rooms intimately and can locate any item in the antique clutter of countless conquests, royal gifts, and opulent indulgence. Noting the awe and apprehension on the faces of the two investigators - overwhelmed by the opportunity to caress and examine objects of legendary beauty or notoriety from among the piles of paintings, tapestries, jewels and bejeweled weapons, gold plate, rare oversized books - he asks, \\"Frightened? . . . Everybody is frightened on their first visit. At night the spirits of these objects whisper to each other.\\"<br />With its whispering spirits, sentient paintings, quirky lovers, and a lost world fully realized and recovered, My Name Is Red is an absorbing, gorgeous gift of a novel from a master artist.<br />(And let me conclude by singing a paean in praise of amazon.com. I would never have discovered this book had I not, having read through several non-fiction works on Turkey, gone to the amazon.com web-page of one and seen \\"Customers who bought titles like this one also bought . . .\\" My Name is Red. \\"An intriguing title,\\" I thought.

US	52793993	R25M9E2DHDCC5L	1903436672	43217624	Hamlet (Arden Shakespeare: Second Series)	Books	5	30	34	N	N	Simply Indispensable	When Henry James sat down to write on his Venetian travels for what later became the Italian Hours, he began with a disclaimer: \\"It is a great pleasure to write the word; but I am not sure there is not a certain impudence in pretending to add anything to it.\\" Turning to Shakespeare, we might amuse ourselves by writing on, say, Hamlet, but can anything be said that's not already been said, and better, a dozen times, by superior critics and closer readers? In the appropriate spirit of humility (and in utter submission to the Bard and his great gift to civilization), I offer a few thoughts on the Arden 2nd Edition of Hamlet, and not on &quot;the greatest work in the history of literature.&quot;<br />Hamlet is by far the longest of the Ardens at 574 pages. It breaks down thusly:  the prefatory material of editor Harold Jenkins - one of the Arden Series general editors and a Hamlet authority of great renown - alone takes up 164 pages.  Three-quarters of this is bibliographical and historical. In his 40-page critical introduction, Jenkins addresses many of the plays thorniest problems, with the Talmudic attentiveness of the closest reader. Then comes the play itself, spread over 264 pages (in terms of sheer length relative to the Bard's other plays, the text is a monster, coming in at more than 3800 lines). Each page of the Arden includes an average half-page of Jenkins' detailed, argumentative, authoritative, and uncommonly helpful footnotes. The final 146 pages consist of longer (end)notes that Jenkins simply could not physically fit onto the bottom of a page. Many of these are short essays (including an appendix that glosses an earlier discussion on the dating of the play).<br />Each of the Arden Hamlet's three sections might merit separate publication (after a modest bit of repackaging), but as a totality, Jenkins' edition must be the greatest value on the Shakespeare market.  Jenkins' ruminations on the provenance of the story and the many sources Shakespeare might have drawn on, the \\"Ur-Hamlet\\" that might have come from the quill of contemporary Thomas Kyd (The Spanish Tragedy), the complexities of determining an authoritative text, the drama's inconsistencies and unanswered questions, the import of the great soliloquy of III.i  (which is emphatically NOT, insists Jenkins, a deliberation on whether to commit suicide), Elizabethan revenge dramas in general, and so much more make this a truly indispensable, illuminating, even breathtaking volume.<br />We think we know this play well.  We have read it, and seen performed on stage and in memorable or hideously forgettable films. Many of its greatest lines are embedded in our hearts.  The beginning of true understanding, however, resides in a superbly annotated scholarly edition. The Arden is one of several choices you can make and is for me the one to own, equally suitable for students, scholars, actors, and mere Bardolators. It will - provided, of course, you are not already a scholarly specialist in Elizabethan drama - knock the scales from your eyes. And until the 3rd edition now in preparation under Ann Thompson is published, this Hamlet will stand as the epitome of the Arden Shakespeare's greatness as a series.have drawn on, the \\"Ur-Hamlet\\" that might have come from the quill of contemporary Thomas Kyd (The Spanish Tragedy), the complexities of determining an authoritative text, the drama's inconsistencies and unanswered questions, the import of the great soliloquy of III.i  (which is emphatically NOT, insists Jenkins, a deliberation on whether to commit suicide), Elizabethan revenge dramas in general, and so much more make this a truly indispensable, illuminating, even breathtaking volume.  <br />We think we know this play well.

US	52793993	R3CGSA8WQY2SIW	0393308626	639608055	The Far Side of the World (Vol. Book 10)  (Aubrey/Maturin Novels)	Books	4	23	26	N	N	Exhilarating . . . But Easily the Weakest of the First Ten	Patrick O'Brian himself seemed to recognize, in his prefatory comments, that The Far Side of the World was unequivocally his weakest effort in the series to this point. Plot is virtually non-existent: take command (again) of the HMS Surprise to find, and deal with, the USS Norfolk, which is harassing British whalers in the South Seas. Period. The novel nevertheless has a captivating title, which explains the decision by Universal-Miramax-Fox (which studio DOESN'T have a piece?) to cobble together the titles of the first and the tenth Aubrey-Maturin installments into possibly the single longest film title of the season. (And, judging from the trailer and the promotional materials, the movie will have absolutely nothing to do with The Far Side of the World beyond the appropriation of its title.)<br />What this novel displays amid its linear spareness, however, is O'Brian's particular genius in characterization, his anthropological eye for the details of nautical life during the Regency, and his love of imparting - in impeccably wrought, Austenian prose - the arcane bit of datum, observation, procedure, or lore. Working within a lean plot structure, he fills his customary 300-plus pages with new turns on his by-now signature themes and concerns - friendship, love, betrayal, heroism, integrity, leadership (indeed, a surpassingly good volume on \\"leadership\\" could be compiled from these books) - while continuing to build an encyclopedic account of life at sea in the early 19th Century.<br />The humanity of O'Brian's two principal characters, and the manner in which both they and their relationship develop over the course of the series, is the essence of the literary miracle O'Brian has created. His hero, Captain Jack Aubrey, a lion at sea and a naïf ashore, has by the time of this novel been more than two years at sea, has left his beloved wife to deal with an army of creditors and bad business deals, and must bear the weight of a blustering father who, as a member of Parliament and the Radical anti-government interest, gives Admiralty leadership what justification it requires to disfavor Aubrey. Stephen Maturin - ship's surgeon, \\"natural philosopher,\\" and naval intelligence operative par excellence - is Aubrey's \\"particular friend\\" (and, I presume, O'Brian's idealized literary self, in knee-breeches and smudged silk stockings). A brilliant epitome of the Enlightenment, Maturin, an Irish \\"papist,\\" is uncommonly learned, wise in the ways of human frailty, as cunning ashore as Aubrey is naïve, and hopelessly in love with a woman whose fidelity he can never ensure.<br />On their long voyage around the Horn to the \\"far side of the world,\\" O'Brian has time to develop detailed expositions on aspects of seamanship and life at sea - objects of long research in the naval archives and among his own acquisitions - on which in the course of the series he has yet to comment. He provides discourses on whaling (for the unabridged version, see Moby Dick), the provisioning of ships, the education of \\"squeakers\\" - the young midshipmen who ship with Aubrey - ways to float ships grounded on sandbars at low tide, the society of seaman at sea and their omerta-like rules of conduct, and so much more.<br />Of course, by this 10th Aubrey-Maturin novel, O'Brian knew he was in for the long haul. Here, as throughout the series, he demonstrates a sure mastery of pacing, planting a variety of ticking time bombs - for example, letters that will not be read until subsequent novels - and ties up, wholly or partially, ends left loose from earlier installments. (I would imagine these to be difficult novels to read out of sequence, even though O'Brian is diligent in trying to fill in necessary detail without becoming tedious to devotees.) Secondary characters like Sophie Aubrey, Diana Villiers, Aubrey's steward Killick and other members of ship's company, and assorted friends, heroes, villains, knaves, and simple walk-ons are all etched sharply by O'Brian and, if they're around for more than one tale, show a stable core of personality amid human variableness and growth. As an single example, I point to the development of the disturbing Mr. Andrew Wray - a senior Admiralty official of many sinister attributes who makes a brief but important appearance here - as being particularly impressive over several books.<br />Worthier reviewers than I claim these novels to comprise the finest literary series ever written. I cannot imagine anyone reading more than one and not agreeing. Each book is at once wholly familiar yet entirely different from its predecessors, set in O'Brian's uniquely realized world, as fascinating ashore as at sea - with everything floating in O'Brian's poetic prose. Each book is worth the effort to encounter.<br />But you may need help. I did. As companions to O'Brian's unstintingly accurate period language and settings - and particularly those who will never intuitively understand the meaning of \\"wear ship\\" or \\"haul wind\\" - I recommend the helpful work of Dean King, O'Brian's unauthorized biographer, who has compiled two indispensable reference works, a glossary and a gazetteer.<br />And while I'm at it, permit me to commend the astonishing Recorded Books Unabridged editions of the Aubrey-Maturin novels, narrated by the incomparable Patrick Tull, who, with a myriad of accurate dialects and accents, transforms bare words on a page into spoken dramas of subtle beauty and rare power.they're around for more than one tale, show a stable core of personality amid human variableness and growth.

I am particularly puzzled by the all the laudatory ink that's been spread on behalf of Akunin's protagonist, Erast Fandorin, who after this first outing seems insufficiently interesting to warrant a second look:  his deductions aren't so much deduced as given to him by the narrator out of a magician's hat.  And although Fandorin surely seems plucky enough, the author allows him to escape the consequences of uncalculated recklessness with an inexplicable imperviousness to the rules of chance.  This is a very cinematic book, and Akunin's model may well be \\"007\\" - with a thoroughly unbelievable Bondian bravado born of a series-length immortality -  rather than the Sherlock Holmes who has been invoked in several reviews. Indeed, the movement of the story is reminiscent of Ian Fleming's yarns, with increments of plot and subplot building nicely, until the monster-plot and, behind it, the super-villain make their appearances - and out goes the laws of physics and any semblance of reality.<br />Despite such maddening tendencies, The Winter Queen nevertheless has its charms, which reside primarily in its appealing 19th century Russian (and London) locales.  For Tolstoi-, Dostoyevskii-, and Tugenev-mavens, this is welcome terra cognita; for others, Akunin provides a graceful introduction to a lost world of manners and mores among the Russian aristocracy and near-aristocrats.  The author enjoys his little word games and puzzles - and gamesmanship is one of the book's  running themes - and entertains his readers with such things as a spurious etymology for the phrase \\"Russian Roulette\\" (which sent me, for one, to the reference books).  Some reviewers have commented on the literary quality of the original Russian-language novels, and the translation, by Andrew Bromfield, is lively, colloquial, and prettily wrought.  (The footnoted foreign phrases - Akunin's well-bred Russians were at least bilingual and often had English and German in addition to French - will please some and seem intrusive to others.  I liked them.)<br />Akunin has written another nine Fandorin novels (and, by now, perhaps another).  The Winter Queen itself has a enough loose ends to lay clear the way to several sequels.  I'll probably take a look at the second number in the series, but - despite The Winter Queen's many strengths - I'll be wary.riginal Russian-language novels, and the translation, by Andrew Bromfield, is lively, colloquial, and prettily wrought.

Let us specify a few: it is, first of all, a disturbing tale of obsession - Charles Cleasby's maniacal pursuit of evidence to exonerate Admiral Horatio Nelson of any malfeasance in what history has recorded as Nelson's distinctly unheroic behavior in Naples in 1798.<br />Unsworth has also written a subversive work of biographical art - the author notes in interviews that Losing Nelson in fact began its life as a commissioned biography of the supreme British hero. With vigorous economy Unsworth covers the main biographical bases and provides the reader, almost miraculously, with both sides of the interpretation with which Cleasby and all Nelsonographers must grapple. (Indeed, more plentiful source citations would have been helpful, although Unsworth does a nice job of working some of his documentation into the narrative - several times causing me to smile and shake my head in admiration at his cleverness in doing so.)<br />The book also works as a complexly interwoven meditation on the related themes of fame, heroism, nobility, patriotism, and virtuousness - again, from both sides, but adding another familiar dimension to Unsworth's \\"angel-of-light\\" and \\"angel-of-darkness\\" considerations, recalling the two sides of Henry V - the unabashedly jingoistic view of Prince Hal (Nelson) versus the play's pragmatic Falstaffian overtones that probe unsettlingly into \\"what IS honor?\\" This is a most timely aspect of the book: each era creates its own heroes - think of what we lionize as \\"heroic\\" and those whom we call \\"hero\\" - and Unsworth is as careful in presenting the building blocks of Nelson's fame as he is unsparing in dissecting the dynamic (for it IS a process) of heroism and its perpetuation.<br />Losing Nelson is also a modernist (not postmodern) psychological narrative of considerable virtuosity. Unsworth handles his twin-track materials with breathtaking seamlessness, sometimes moving incrementally through segues from Cleasby to Nelson (almost like the walking Henry Hull changing into the Werewolf of London as he passes behind successive pillars) and sometimes back and forth inside Cleasby-Nelson. One finishes some passages of this book simply to sit back in startled wonder: \\"how did he manage THAT?\\" Unsworth is a flawless craftsman, a master of pacing (the true narrative art) who knows when to divulge a tidbit of information and when to withhold. And he never cheats the reader.<br />Sprinkled throughout the novel are marvelous, beautifully realized characters. We have the astonishing Cleasby himself - what a creation! Brilliant and method-to-his-madness \\"on to something,\\" edgy, obsessive-compulsive, scarred by a domineering father, of bizarrely diffuse sexuality. There are the cleverly written debunkers, including Miss Lily the Avon Services \\"Kelly Girl\\" temp who transcribes Cleasby's handwritten Nelson study, and her sparely but devastatingly drawn son, as well as the expatriate whom Cleasby hopes holds the key to the Naples episode, and the assorted oddballs, cranks, and losers who hang out at the London Nelson Society.<br />Much has been made of the Unsworth's \\"surprise\\" ending. I believe more than a few readers will anticipate some variation of the ending - I did, through no special perspicacity but simply as a hand-wringing reader, wholly enjoying his immersion in the Nelson-Cleasby universe and, riffling through as many unsatisfactory ways the book might end as I could imagine, hitting upon the one - one I had feared - playing it out, and thus feeling slightly let down at the end. As the dust jacket observes, \\"Something has to give way, and give it does - in the most astonishing and entertaining of ways.\\" Having lived so intimately with Charles Cleasby, I wanted something better for him, and certainly something less - well, I'll say it, and I don't think it's a spoiler - hackneyed.

I found myself puzzling over his technical explanations, rummaging through my library for a superior cutaway of the dome to better visualize his wordy exegesis. Oddly, each of the three well-known books I turned to - Murray's Architecture of the Italian Renaissance, Kostof's History of Architecture, and Hartt's History of Italian Renaissance Art - had precisely the same superb cutaway of the dome within a dome, showing Brunelleschi's Gothic vaulting underneath the classically inspired outer dome. \\"Mirabile dictu, so that's it!\\" This is only one of many instances where King created confusion where he might have parted the technical mists, with clearer text or with a better mating of text to illustration.<br />A corollary to this concern: for a book that has a fair number of illustrations, I found these, for the most part, woefully chosen. I appreciated the reproductions of period etchings and drawings, but these should have been supplemented with additional helps for the text. And at the very close, as a veritable punchline to the short book, King provides one small photograph of the dome in middle distance - no angles, no details, no close-up of the lantern, no full-page, no color. For readers who have neither been to Florence and seen the magnificent Santa Maria del Fiore in its urban context nor seen many illustrations or aspects of the dome, these are galling omissions.<br />As for the second term of the contract, King simply walks away from the subtitle's claim. Brunelleschi did indeed reinvent architecture, but not with the magnificent engineering feat of spanning the transept of Santa Maria del Fiore. On page 45, King discusses several commissions Brunelleschi won during the period in which he worked on the dome. Two of these, the Oespedale degli Innocenti and the Basilica of Santo Spiritu, literally did reinvent architecture. By investing these structures with rounded arches, classical columns, domal vaults, and classically derived ornamentation and proportions, Brunelleschi recovered for the Renaissance - before others could beat him to it - the architectural accomplishments of classical Rome. In an interesting chapter on Brunelleschi and Donatello's Roman adventure, King provides necessary background for understanding the Florentine achievement.<br />What happened? Here's my theory: King, a fledgling historian but seasoned novelist, might have submitted a longer draft to his publisher, who may have responded, \\"you've got two stories here. One is really interesting, has a strong narrative line, tension, characters, villains, obstacles - a brilliant story. Tell the tale of il duomo! And lose that BOOORRRRing stuff about the Foundling Hospital and the other churches.\\" And maybe, just maybe, the dutiful novelist cut his manuscript to the lively story before us. That said, the publisher liked the title, or perhaps even composed it to amplify the puzzling phrase \\"Brunelleschi's Dome\\" to novitiates, promising the biggest of the big pictures on the cheap - in well under two hunded profusely illustrated pages.<br />A strong indictment. But I did indeed like this book a great deal and recommend it without difficulty - with the above qualifications. As I was reading it - actually, I went back and forth between the book itself and the Books on Tape edition, narrated much much too quickly by Richard Matthews, a chipper Brit - it struck me as exemplary \\"popular history\\": absolutely compelling as a story, vividly bringing to life Brunelleschi, aspects of his times, his rivals (particularly Lorenzo Ghiberti and his allies), throwing in everything but the kitchen sink - a little bit on war, military engineering, goldsmiths, political skullduggery (actually, King is weak here but provides useful dabs of color: Florence was a boiling pot) - with occasional patches of humor. In the end, this is a sequence of delightfully strung-together anecdotes woven though a book more about engineering - statics, stresses, and lifting machines -than about architecture and design. Filippo may have reinvented site management and construction techniques as well, but that's not the claim of the title, and it's not nearly as sexy as the universal \\"reinvention of an art form.\\" If you're really interested in the topic, you'll have to look elsewhere to resolve the questions that still go begging once you've finished this brisk, enjoyable romp through 15th Century Florence.nk - a little bit on war, military engineering, goldsmiths, political skullduggery (actually, King is weak here but provides useful dabs of color: Florence was a boiling pot) - with occasional patches of humor.

You say, you've never given the \\"Swiss Enlightenment\\" a moment's thought? Surely you knew that Rousseau was native to - and chased from - Geneva? And that Ferney, Voltaire's estate, straddled the Swiss-French border? But there's more! Professor Ulrich Im Hof, the Swiss scholar commissioned to write the Enlightenment volume in Blackwell's The Making of Europe series, is going to make sure you hear about every bit of it. But surreptitiously, when he thinks you'll barely notice. If you would but look, you'll find more index entries under Zurich, Berne, and Geneva EACH than on Paris - yes, THAT Paris: the moral, spiritual, social, and cultural center of the Enlightenment - and Basel gets as many as London (4). Paying careful attention, you'll observe that virtually every chapter includes some type of Swiss counterpoint - the chapter on \\"reading societies,\\" for example, contains two meaty examples, one on the Learned Reading Society of Mainz, Germany, admittedly \\"something of a backwater,\\" and the Reformed Moral Society of Toggenberg, \\"a flourishing centre of rural industries in the foothills of the eastern Swiss Alps.\\" You will also find here everything you may have wanted to know about the Economic Society of Berne, and the Swiss Helvetian Societies, and the 18th century Swiss writer Isaac Iselin (who has three more index entries than Helvetius himself), and other rarities of the age.<br /><br />But enough: The Making of Europe series is, after all, a collaboration between five European publishers and has a pan-European perspective. To his considerable credit, Professor Im Hof does astonishingly well to cram into a very slender volume so much information (and so much of his own original research on, ah, the Swiss Enlightenment), managing to mention every country and most personalities (including America and Ben Franklin, but without a mention in the index). He is determined to say something on everything, and offers useful discussions on aspects of society - in its many parts: kings, courts, aristocracy, clergy, urban dwellers, farmers, all manner of other common folk - states and their interactions, and, most particularly, on institutional structures - reading societies, associations, the salon, charitable and economic societies, Freemasons, etc. - through which enlightened thought was diffused throughout town and country, seeping across borders and covering the continent. Leading ideas are neatly batched and summarized, chapter by chapter, and Im Hof includes a particularly fine, multi-chapter discussion of the dimensions of \\"emancipation,\\" a favored Enlightenment term. The book concludes with useful sections on the anti-Enlightenment and \\"the way ahead\\" into the 19th century, where 18th century ideational continuities and adumbrations play themselves out.<br /><br />The index is lazily compiled and far from comprehensive. The documentation is also thin - many too few endnotes, and often even long quotations go undocumented, although you can generally reconstruct a citation from references in the text.<br /><br />But all in all, this is a useful, unusually well-written, even BRISK, volume that may stimulate in readers a variety of collateral curiosities and add to their understanding of familiar areas. Im Hof's survey of The Enlightenment is well worth having on a medium-sized Enlightenment shelf - particularly one devoid of most Swiss traces of the great 18th Century.parts: kings, courts, aristocracy, clergy, urban dwellers, farmers, all manner of other common folk - states and their interactions, and, most particularly, on institutional structures - reading societies, associations, the salon, charitable and economic societies, Freemasons, etc. - through which enlightened thought was diffused throughout town and country, seeping across borders and covering the continent.

Looking over the previous reviews of Kinzer's book, it's safe to say that, for the Turkey cognoscenti, little that is written about Turkey for a popular audience will please unless written to exacting specifications (by a Turkish author or heavily credentialed scholar). Mere \\"observers,\\" such as journalists, will not do.<br />For the general reader, though, everything beyond his or her national border is a potential revelation, which gives the genre of \\"journalistic account\\" plenty of room to flourish. And it does.<br />I remember enjoying many of Stephen Kinzer's tales of Turkey in the Times. And I'm somewhere in between on Turkey, with some working knowledge of current issues and a some background in the region and its history. I enjoyed and admire this book for its broad brush introduction to the range of issues that American readers will need to understand if they're ever going to \\"get\\" Turkey.  Each chapter isolates a specific topic in contemporary Turkish politics - and this is very defintely a work in which the main concern is politics - and lays out useful background and local commentary. Kinzer is helpful on the Turkish concept of \\"devlet\\" (the State), the Kurdish issue, Armenians, Turkey and Greece, the transforming effect of the Izmit earthquake of 1999, the military and the civilian political elites, and Turkish Islamism. He uses standard journalistic devices - mostly interviews, first hand eyewitness reportage, and personal anecdotes - to bring arid topics to life. The writing is generally vigorous, swiftly moving, and entertaining.<br />Kinzer also provides useful thumbnail introductions to Atat&uuml;rk, Kemalism, and the myriad ways Kemalism continues to course through most walks of Turkish life. For seasoned Turkey hands, pages like these will be brief, dispensable detours; for the ignoranti, it's a present help in need and a cue to \\"find out more\\" if interested. By all means supplement Kinzer with a reputable history - even though most \\"history\\" on the current Turkey lists has also been written by journalists (including one by one of Kinzer's NY Times predecessors in Ankara) - but not as a substitute for Kinzer himself. A history will be likely to omit, for example, a discussion of how all the redlines and taboos that circumscribe public life in Turkey work out in practice. This is the useful province of journalism.<br />One large authorial issue in making of book out of pile of impressionistic pieces written against deadline is in discovering, and imposing, a point of view that leavens the writing and lifts it to a plane more universal that it was in its first, perishable, realization. Here I think Kinzer's publisher, FSG, let him down by permitting him to redundantly opine on the shortcomings of the Turkish political elite, military, and state.  Both author and publisher surely viewed this as permissible \\"analysis,\\" but many readers will find it as cranky, irritating, and preachy as I did. Every single chapter includes a dollop or more of Kinzer's sermonizing injunctions to the Turks, which would best have been factored out and saved for the concluding chapter, which repeats them all.<br />I would not let its shortcomings deter me, though, from picking up Crescent and Star as an introduction to Turkish interests and issues. It is effortless and absorbing reading.ti, it's a present help in need and a cue to \\"find out more\\" if interested.

First reading H.L. Mencken - Prejudices, First Series - way back in grad school, I felt as though I were under rhetorical and ideational assault. Over and over again, ambushed by Mencken's relentless pushing prodding needling stratospheric chthonic ribald mocking joyously playful yet deadly serious language, finding it so jaw-droppingly, startlingly funny that I'd be howling out loud at 2 a.m., waking wife, kids, to whom I'd try to read his inimitable raillery against mountebanks, poltroons, Comstockery, \\"uplift,\\" and the full panoply of the sins and sinners of his age. Mencken's rhetorical excessiveness, his superabundance of sinuous, surprising, jazz-like prose (he wouldn't have liked that simile) thrilled me, made me want more, made me a devotee for life. And after pondering long and hard, the only writer I can today imagine comparing to Mencken is Cintra Wilson - but as a Mencken on a delirious cocktail of speed, acid, extra bile for a less genteel audience, and pther mystery elixirs that may be swirling through the stream of her imagination. But, my God, this is simply startling, uproarious, deadly accurate journalism.<br />It begins with a brilliance of eye. Wilson sees segments of the spectrum that the rest of us are blind to - great journalism begins in great observation. I would quote, extensively, but I don't want to diminish the pleasures of discovery for any who might pick up this book. Let me simply say that Wilson has a long skewer and, impaled like stacked shishkabob, are a long list of deserving (and deservingly easy) victims, icluding Cher, Bruce Willis, Ike Turner, the dancing-singing-boy groups, and Keanu Reeves; surprising appearances by Jack Nicholson, Jack Palance, and others, and, perhaps most unforgettably (and a most timely inclusion), Michael Jackson and \\"the nose.\\" And, no, this isn't a simple case of status envy: Wilson's criticisms are deeply rooted in the behavioral characteristics of the studied species, homo celebricanus, which, as we sadly see in the new reality TV rage (American Idol, etc.), might as well be ANY of us, given a few million dollars and a People Magazine cover. A Massive Swelling makes for immediate, even necessary, reading and deserves a new edition with a prefatory essay that pulls the current mass hysteria/idolatry into perspective.<br />But for all Wilson's long, feverish, and spot-on ranting against the disease of celebrity in the United States and the myriads of ways in which is distorts our culture, society, economy, she also bestows. . . praise. This strikes the reader as oddly as would delicate hands on a Cyclops. It is equally hilarious, pinning the recipient of Wilson's encomia to his or her own unique piece of corkboard for detailed scrutiny. I direct the prospective reader to the peerless portrait of King Hell Mick Jagger for a brilliant sample of Wilsonian tribute.<br />I was tempted to dock Wilson a star for being so wholly oblivious to the many, many things other thoughtful commentators have written on fame, celebrity, and the perversions of both (they ARE different - \\"fame\\" is earned, like Julius Caesar's; \\"celebrity\\" is simply the fact of being celebrated while generally otherwise lacking merit, like the 9 American Idol losers). I couldn't bring myself to do such a thing to a book that, and writer who, so completely transported, entertained, and enlightened me - with an average belly-laugh a page. Mencken assumed room temperature half-a-hundred years ago, but the Menckenesque debunking spirit lives on in Cintra Wilson.

As it is, she is simply the author of stimulating, beautifully conceived and compiled, engagingly written works of revisionist history with a uniquely, appealingly literary twist. Worldly Goods looks at the Renaissance through its material traces and transactions, focusing on the immortal works of art, yes, but using them forensically as primary depictions of a burgeoning material culture that invariably gets lost in our customary focus on \\"humanism\\" and the great \\"humanists.\\" And the artistic evidence Jardine considers includes jewelry, tapestries, books, maps, and the full range of opulent artifacts that, assembled in display, demonstrated the stature of the owner to his or her beholders.<br />In an imaginative preface, Jardine creates a powerful hook, taking the reader across the surface of Carlo Crivelli's lovely \\"Annunciation with St. Emidius,\\" then diving deeply to a close analysis of the imagery. What Jardine calls attention to is not the prayerful Virgin with downcast eyes or the calling Archangel at the point of \\"Ave!\\" but to the contemporary urban Italian setting of the meeting. Here we are not, as you may think, on familiar ground - \\"Oh, I know - Leonardo gives his Annunciation a well-known, but anachronistic, Tuscan background because that's what the era's painters KNEW\\" - because Jardine's analytic eye is on the profusion of lovely objects that literally spills into the street from the marble- and terracotta-clad house in which Mary prays: rugs, vases, hanging tapestries, wall and ceiling paneling, finely tooled books, ornamental plants, a peacock. And among these objects are items contemporary viewers would have immediately recognized as the especially prized and precious products of international commerce: Ottoman rugs, Venetian glass, Spanish tapestry, English broadcloth, and more. This is a commerical civilization in capsule. We are carefully led to join Jardine in concluding that Crivelli, in addition to inspiring a numinous awe in the picture's viewers, almost certainly sought also to create a \\"frisson of desire at the lavishness of (the) surroundings,\\" in the service of a wealthy patron whose munificence was therein on display.<br />The revelatory point, of course, is Jardine's suggestion that \\"the impulses which today we disparage as `consumerism' might occupy a respectable place in the characterization of the new Renaissance mind.\\" She prosecutes this thesis with great vigor, imagination, and thoughtful interweaving of evidence from commercial, artistic, scientific, philosophic, and literary sources (which, sadly, receive NO documentation whatsoever except for a bibliography that does not seem comprehensive). The chapter titles tell much of the story - \\"Conditions for Change: Goods in Profusion,\\" \\"The Price of Magnificence,\\" \\"The Triumph of the Book,\\" \\"New Expertise for Sale,\\" \\"A Culture of Commodities\\" - although each is an absolutely brilliant essay that takes its thematic lead from the title but interweaves collateral evidence from diverse sources and field of endeavor.<br />We always knew the great merchant and banking houses were also the major patrons of the Raphaels, Michaelangelos, and Leonardos and that all the geniuses of artistic beauty worked for commissions. We understood less, however, how thoroughly commercial the era was, how its opulence functioned, and how the spread of learning and beauty was born on commercial wings, for profit, as a series of commercial transactions. In our own time we've debated endlessly the question \\"Can `commercial' also be `art'?\\" And we've taken this issue up with just as much heat when discussing any potential \\"sell-out,\\" high or low, from Julian Schnabel to Green Day. But the answer to this great question, driven home again and again in Lisa Jardine's spectacular book, is \\"of course, dummy.\\"<br />(In addition to the unfortunately lack of scholarly trappings, the book's other failing, which I note parenthetically, is the inclusion of illustrations that from time to time are too small to assist the reader in following Jardine's close visual analysis, an absolutely essential aspect of this work. On the other hand, from time to time, as in her wonderful analysis of Holbein's The Ambassadors, she includes the necessary color plates, plus numerous black and white details, that powerfully advance the analysis. Although beautifully produced, Worldly Goods would be even better in folio - something to hope for - with larger illustrations and many, many more color plates.)<br />Why not bring Professor Jardine to the US of A (the combined Florence, Venice, Rome, and Antwerp of our time) for a few years - which of our major research universities wouldn't like having her on its faculty for a spell? Or how if our own patron creates the position of \\"amazon.com fellow\\" at Harvard, Yale, or Princeton? - and drop a MacArthur on her (she needs to be working here for that to happen), simultaneously certifying her genius and deservedly enriching her.

Jared Diamond combines an almost limitless range of interests - including evolutionary biology, physiology, ornithology, geography, ancient history, anthropology, music, art, literature - and an equally prodigious number of gifts - not the least of which is his penetrating logic, extraordinary ideational fluency, pellucid writing style, and, thankfully, a marvelously open sense of humor. This has all come together in a remarkable trilogy of books culminating in the celebrated Guns, Germs, and Steel. Reading Diamond's The Third Chimpanzee, you can clearly see his formidable mind (recognized by the MacArthur Foundation, which in our day and age of credentials and certifications, makes \\"genius\\" semi-official) at work, pushing his materials to the point where he needed to write GG&S to scratch a particular itch that arose in the researching and writing of Chimpanzee.<br />We humans, Diamond observes at the outset of TTC, share 98 percent of our genetic material with two species of chimpanzees, making us, to an objective observer, merely a third species of chimp. But, oh, do the remaining two percent account for a load: speech, writing, art, culture, and a particularly human proclivity to destroy each other and the things we love, either via fratricidal, often genocidal, war or the degradation of our own environment. Having placed these observations on the table, Diamond then goes on, in gemlike chapters that stand alone as models in the scientific essay genre, to discuss animal and primate precursors of these particularly human behaviors, taking us through the bounty of human developments and the accompanying tragedies. He ends, however, on a hopeful note. Not only are we, as Nietzsche pointed out, \\"the ape that blushes,\\" but also, as Diamond reminds us, the ape that chooses its own future.<br />The net result of Diamond's learned exertions is to render us - me - feeling far more connected to \\"the animal kingdom,\\" to offer compelling food for thought, and to answer the great questions posed in the title of the fabulous Gauguin picture hanging in a Boston gallery: \\"Where Do We Come From? What Are We? We Are We Going?\\"  This is all necessary reading, a scholarly comfort book from one of our most brilliant expositors of evolutionary logic. (And, I should add, happily, that this trilogy will soon be a tetralogy: having addressed the rise of civilizations in GG&S, Diamond is now at work on civilizational, or state, collapse. Something exciting to look forward to.)<br />For a much less hopeful variation on the themes of TTC, see Wrangham and Petersen's Demonic Males, which, like Diamond, documents redundantly the many ways in which we are merely a species of chimpanzees, but which focuses on the manifold facets of higher primate violence inherited by - or imprinted into - homo sapiens sapiens.

I read Saramago's \\"Gospel\\" more than a month ago, and it continues to haunt my imagination. Pick it up. Scan the pages. You'll probably think this is a forbidding work, written in dense, often pages-long, paragraphs, with lengthy stretches of run-together dialogue uninterrupted by paragraph indentations or white space. But begin reading, and all hesitation melts away. The writing is stately, scriptural in diction, careful of every nuance. Saramago's original Portuguese, movingly translated into English by Giovanni Pontiero, creates a convincing \\"gospel voice\\"--rendered from an ambiguous, perhaps \\"omniscient,\\" perspective-to portray Jesus of Nazareth in a startlingly new, and believable, way. And into this narrative Saramago adds credible, plausibly motivated, portraits of Joseph, Mary, James \\"the Brother of Jesus,\\" as well as of both the Deity and the Demon. And, of course, Mary of Magdala.<br />What could a Portuguese atheist (and, perhaps less relevantly, Communist) have to say about the life of Jesus? Don't presume a thing. Simply read, slowly. What will first be apparent is that Saramago respects your intelligence and the sources, and he has done his homework in speculating on how the historical gaps might be filled in: he knows the New Testament, has studied the \\"Gnostic Gospels\\" of NT apocrypha, has read his Josephus and other near-contemporary accounts of the \\"Jewish Wars\\" and first-century Palestine, and seems familiar with the scholarly Jesus Seminar findings. You will then note the expected traces of irony--sometimes fired from unexpected directions--but here deployed surprisingly to draw out the humanity of Jesus's nature and, in my view, to lure the reader into an early misreading of the author's intent. Indeed, the spell Saramago creates throughout the novel's first half issues from what seems a predictably humanistic, psychological point of view. That changes. But I don't feel I can say any more about the direction Saramago takes his story without spoiling for others what was for me a surprising and thrilling narrative transformation, with a string of unexpected, powerful payoffs.<br />Nor can I pretend to say with any confidence that I know which readers Saramago's novel will appeal to most. Each will find Saramago's telling of the Jesus story challenging in his or her own way. What I can do, though, is encourage you-if Saramago's stature as a Nobel laureate is insufficiently encouraging-to keep an open mind, read the book, and ponder the philosophical and theological questions raised in an unforgettable work of literary art.ling for others what was for me a surprising and thrilling narrative transformation, with a string of unexpected, powerful payoffs. <br />Nor can I pretend to say with any confidence that I know which readers Saramago's novel will appeal to most.

The broad contours of the political game have, in the intervening two millennia, acquired several strips of veneer and a few layers of varnish, but they are immediately recognizable in this briskly paced work. Pompey's political ponderousness, Caesar's bright dexterity, and Cicero's conservative deliberateness all find ready parallels in this and every other age. Gain, glory, and fear are here the prime motivators--generalize to politics Thucydides' famous observation that men will go to war for any of these three reasons and you will have neatly summarized all political motive--and Everitt nicely sifts through the ample historical record to relate how the great men of the late Republic clambered for the pinnacle as the challenge of Julius Caesar loomed.<br />For readers not particularly well versed in Roman history, Everitt does particularly well in quickly situating Cicero's life in the great events of his day, the context of an expanding empire, and the daily life of a Rome that had no city government as we would know it--little public security (private guards for the wealthy, nothing for the rest), sanitation, services, or urban administration. An accretion of checks and balances (so admired by our own founders) caused politic to deadlock, with each of the major protagonists offering solutions that either restored, or to circumvented, the formal primacy of the Senate and Rome's great families. Throughout, Everitt renders intelligible a bewildering tangle of events and human interactions. He shows Cicero standing at the center of these great events--with the exception of the plot to kill Caesar, of which he knew nothing (but you who know your Shakespeare will have known this as well...)--or, less charitably, desperately working the Roman public relations apparatus to \\"seem to stand,\\" on firm Republican principals. At those times when when his cause fails--perhaps as a result of words or long harbored grudges that return to haunt him--Everitt's statesman retires to one of his well-appointed villas and the life of the mind, turing to his beloved philosophy and the composition of the writings that comprise his greatest legacy.<br />I dock this commendable biography a star for an insufficiency of documentation and the generally cursory handling of Cicero's ideas. Yes, yes, I recognize this is popular biography, but some particularly quirky looking passages beg for sourcing and don't get it, while other, better known material gets copious sourcing (and with endnotes, by page and passage, rather than with numbered end- or footnotes). As for Cicero's rich store of written ideas, the major works are dutifully listed, their contents for the most part cursorily described. I for one would have appreciated a broader, deeper discussion, but concluded that Everitt viewed his chapters on the works as necessary drudgery required by the life and legacy and as impediments to his narrative design (he does in fact refer to the authoritive scholarly studies in a bibliographic appendix). The author seems too eager to gallop off--perhaps to the cheers of most readers--on his thrilling, often bloody, tale.  And so he does.<br />(And why didn't someone at Random House point out to the design people that the Coliseum, which graces the dustjacket, was erected more than a century after Cicero's death? A particularly shameless attempt to cash in on the Russell Crowe picture.)<br />This is nevertheless a very worthy book and a solid--and solidly entertaining--introduction to the timeless world of Roman politics. Highly recommended.he knew nothing (but you who know your Shakespeare will have known this as well...)--or, less charitably, desperately working the Roman public relations apparatus to \\"seem to stand,\\" on firm Republican principals.

We read these great works and tend to carry our own thoughts and reactions to them inside us. We commit passages to memory because we want to own these words, to be a part of the Great Chain of the English Language, a transgenerational community joined in a common appreciation of the finest, most universal written English yet wrought.<br />But what we really crave is conversation, with a sharing, perceptive interlocutor, with whom we might swap enthusiasms, probe ambiguities, repeat the words, declaim, expound, enact, react. In the end, we remain for the most part solitary enthusiasts. Hence the great and enduring value of the formidable critics and commentators: Johnson, Hazlitt, Pollard, Bradley, Van Doren, Goddard, Mack, Rowse, and, now, Harold Bloom.<br />Of all these, none has provided greater pleasure, or more illuminating argumentation, or profound, quirky observations than Bloom, whom I've come to think of as my wise old Uncle Harold. I go directly from the play to Bloom's Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human, for literary companionship. Taking his leads from Johnson, for whom Shakespeare is the great writer of human nature, and Hegel, who saw Shakespeare's characters as \\"free artists of themselves,\\" Bloom's central teaching is that Shakespeare not only shows us, but literally invents our template for, what it means to be human. He mines this theme throughout, pausing long at the central characters--Falstaff, Rosalind, and Hamlet--who epitomize the lesson. In touching on each of the works, sometimes only briefly but never simply dutifully, Bloom invariably opens up new vistas, adds context, begs controversy, settles old scores and manufactures new ones, leads the reader back to the works for fresh consideration in new dimensions--and all in an avuncular, colloquial voice that I for one find wholly delightful and attractive. The professional lit-crit crowd doesn't share this view--which \\"populizers\\" has it ever easily credited?--but for me, having Bloom on my desk is roughly akin to having the erstwhile \\"brightest grad fellow ever\\" of the most formidable English Department at my beck and call, always willing and ready to sit up late in the Common Room for endless conversations over coffee and cigarettes, until exhaustion sets in, the sun rises, or the tobacco runs out.<br />For all these things and for much else, Bloom's hefty volume joins Schoenbaum's sumptuous, long out of print Documentary Life, Dobson and Wells' Oxford Companion to Shakespeare, and Spevak's similarly OOP Concordance (as well as--pick 'em--your favorite edition of Complete Works: I like the Riverside but am open to other suggestions) on my short desert island shelf, which would occupy me for a lifetime on some God-forsaken atoll. Indeed, I love this indispensable, inexhaustible book and puzzle over those who cannot.is view--which \\"populizers\\" has it ever easily credited?--but for me, having Bloom on my desk is roughly akin to having the erstwhile \\"brightest grad fellow ever\\" of the most formidable English Department at my beck and call, always willing and ready to sit up late in the Common Room for endless conversations over coffee and cigarettes, until exhaustion sets in, the sun rises, or the tobacco runs out. <br />For all these things and for much else, Bloom's hefty volume joins Schoenbaum's sumptuous, long out of print Documentary Life, Dobson and Wells' Oxford Companion to Shakespeare, and Spevak's similarly OOP Concordance (as well as--pick 'em--your favorite edition of Complete Works: I like the Riverside but am open to other suggestions) on my short desert island shelf, which would occupy me for a lifetime on some God-forsaken atoll.

The violence of Sargent's largely paleolithic male society is mitigated only by its loving devotion to \\"The Goddess\\" and her cult, visits to the shrines in which prayer and worshipful communion with the deity transpires, and the occasional \\"callings\\" to the enclaves--simultaneously the preeminent male rite of passage and the sole (blind and thoroughly mediated) interaction with the ruling society that enables both worlds to procreate and persist. Within city walls, the master society is strictly bifurcated into elite and masses, in which the custodians of established order replace themselves, presiding over the bought indifference of commoners.<br /><br />Sargent is a beautifully expressive writer who works out the logic of her story to persuasive conclusions and, along the way, has smart, thoroughly rendered observations to make on societies of women and of men, the humanistic origins of religion, small group interactions under duress, the transformation of nomadic bands into sedentary cultures, the possible retreat of civilization from its points of greatest advancement, a variety of contemporary feminist political ideas, and more. At times, The Shore of Women brought to mind a host of antecedents, including A Canticle for Leibowitz, Lord of the Flies, The Golden Bough, Greek and Roman mythology, captivity stories from 17th and 18th century prisoners of American woodland Indians, the writings of Margaret Meade and other classic anthropologists, and other possible references, but without seeming directly dependent on any. Its principal characters, the inquisitive newly \\"called\\" man Arvil and the cast-out woman Birana, are beautifully developed and pass through punctuated sequences of change and unfolding awareness.

Indeed, with a bit of clever marketing, The School of Night might give Shakespeare's doubters, or at least enthusiasts of Marlovian authorship, the same kind of rhetorical boost Josephine Tey's The Daughter of Time gave to the Ricardians (who maintain crookback Richard III was really all sweetness and light and view Shakespeare's play as based wholly on Tudor propaganda and misinformation).<br /><br />Wall is a subtle writer who moves adeptly, and with economic efficiency, in simultaneously odd, interesting, learned, and tidily interreleated directions. This is literary writing, filled with symbology, scholarly allusion, and deft metaphor, but all in the most unobtrusive and graceful manner. Moreover, books of this sort must be in good part tutorial, and Wall has done his homework. At appropriate moments, he feeds us the essential elements of the authorial controversy, introduces the various contenders to the throne, and ultimately settles on Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare's great contemporary, as the alter-Bard. The novel then unfolds as narrator Sean Tallow seeks to decipher the secret of &#34;The School of Night,&#34; which is at once an obscure reference from the early comedy Love's Labour Lost and, perhaps, a secret society to which Marlowe may have belonged.<br /><br />Principal characters are closely observed and artfully developed. Bibliomaniacs of all stripes will recognize and root for the introspective antiquarian Sean Tallow and his quest, but the parallel story of Tallow's relationship to a boyhood friend and his increasingly complex--and shady--life does more than allow Wall to space out his revelations. Both stories move in surprising directions, interact nicely, and wend their ways to what I found to be a satisfying conclusion. Moreover, it is a conclusion, even a moral, that I surmise the Bard--whoever he was--would wholeheartedly endorse.<br /><br />In short, a very rich, very entertaining, very instructive novel, filled with character, imagery, insight, and narrative tension--not exactly sound and fury, but certainly signifying at the very least an exciting writer whose books I'll eagerly search out.nicely, and wend their ways to what I found to be a satisfying conclusion.

In the course of the tale, the recollection expands, through paths at first dimly remembered but, over time, recovered with increasing clarity. Michael Frayn deploys these Proustian materials brilliantly, detailing with quick strokes a lost world of childhood in wartime London, of proto-suburban enclaves that are more like thatch villages than city neighborhoods, where even hidden lives seem transparent, everyone seems to be watching everyone else, and nothing escapes the attention of the village children, those custodians of every local scandal, romance, adventure, and suspicion.<br />The story begins meekly, as a trip down memory lane, and slowly, like a Ravelian Bolero, gains in intensity and pace. One of Spies' most impressive aspects is, in the interplay between narrator and narration, the way in which Frayn withholds from the reader information that the young Stephen could not yet have figured out or understood. This allows the story, despite the older Stephen's omniscient point of view, to unfold naturally and almost perfectly from a child's-eye view, but blended with adult-perspective hindsight to provide texture and depth and, in some instances, additional layers of ambiguity.<br />Spies will appeal strongly to readers of a certain age, who as children in a pre-television era relied on their own resourcefulness and imagination to entertain themselves, who literally assembled their own universes from found materials. Spies is, moreover, one of the very best depictions of a child's groping to make sense of the adult world from within the conspiratorial know-it-all world of childhood.<br />I must confess, however, that I was tempted to dock Frayn a star for the unsatisfying--for me--way in which he handled aspects of the concluding 20-30 pp (it's no spoiler to mention this--plenty of reviews already have). But the sated sense of satisfaction in which I basked as I closed the book precluded anything other than full credit. With economical prose, vivid characterization, and superbly realized WWII fringe-London mise-en-scene, Michael Frayn has added another small gem to his oeuvre, one you will tear through in a sitting, pausing only, I'll warrant, to reflect on your own lost world of childhood.-plenty of reviews already have).

Kennedy is a brilliant storyteller and thumbnail biographer, and the story he tells is nothing less than the monumental tale of Franklin Roosevelt's &quot;rendezvous with destiny&quot; and how that encounter made us, in most significant dimensions, what we are today. The categories that defined the political debate over the New Deal are with us today, but the United States of 1929, where this narrative begins, although well within living memory, is scarcely recognizable for the revolution that Roosevelt and the 20th century's &quot;thirty years war&quot; wrought.<br />Here is the dramatic story of the &quot;southern problem&quot; -- the proud, intransigent backwardness of the American &quot;mezzogiorno&quot; -- Hoover's and Roosevelt's dogged efforts to remedy the rural woes that are the backdrop for the Great Depression, Hoover's heroic but doomed struggle to cope with economic collapse from within a confining conceptual box out of which he could not imagine his way, the brilliant Hundred Days of inaugural New Deal legislation, the labor wars of the mid-1930s and the rise of homegrown radicalism, the first stirrings of a proto-Civil Rights movement (and the appointment by Roosevelt of the first African-American judges to the Federal bench), the &quot;Court-packing&quot; controversy of 1937 that marked -- but did not cause -- the New Deal's grinding halt, and a brilliant summation of &quot;What the New Deal Meant.&quot; The excellent chapters on WWII, and particularly on the home front, are in my view a solid and useful bonus (and provide an overview of material that many readers are likely to know much better than the 1930s story): the thrilling first half of this book is by itself worth the purchase price.<br />Kennedy writes sparkling prose, is a master of compression and synthesis, gives all significant sides their due (however briefly), offers balanced judgments, and has given us an excellent survey of a time when many roads and options were open, when the stakes were monumental, and when America truly might have become something very diffent from what it ultimately became. Read this, and press it into the hands of your children, and then thank whichever God you may pray to for the events that transpired from 1929 to 1945 and the way they worked out in US history.

Thus did Josephine Tey, near the close of her authorial career, delve into some of the lost nooks and crannies of English history in an effort to recover \\"the real Richard.\\"<br />The well-known hurdle for all would-be Ricardians is, of course, the utter absence of source material contemporary to Richard's reign, and most of all anything that discusses the fate of the \\"princes in the Tower.\\" All that is generally counted as \\"authoritative,\\" it turns out, is the product of Tudor dynasty information factories. Tey, however, very likely had in her possession the writings of Sir Clements Markham, a late Victorian-era civil servant, whose careful revisionist argument is here unfolded in a lively, compelling narrative of incremental discovery.<br />Prompted by a reproduction of a famous portrait of Richard, Tey's laid-up sleuth, with the help of an American researcher, marshalls from his bed an archival assault on the estimable Sir Thomas More, Henry (the VII) Tudor, and the entire phalanx of worthies who have reported, for the last half a millennium, that Richard was the demonic crookback murderer of Shakespeare's characterization. Happily for us, there's more (sic) to the story than the traditional record, and those not already sucked into the revisionist Ricardian argument may very well be converted. Tey's engaging \\"fiction\\" is not only a great boon to all Ricardians--who, with Richard III Societies on both sides of the pond, must surely win hundreds if not thousands of new converts yearly as a result of this 50-year-old work--but the perfect place to begin your own exploration of this great historical proto-conspiracy.	2002-02-11

One laments the death of poetry's ability to move the masses, laments the lost world in which poetry was a master art, in which Longfellow might hold a theater in thrall with tales of Gitchee Gumee.<br /><br />Why doesn't everyone who reads in the English Language know Philip Larkin?<br /><br />Oh, this Larkin is most assuredly not for every taste--he is ugly, rueful, bitter, timorous, and in these he is wholly and perfectly one with his poetic voice. He is a formalist--a large quantity of rhymed iambic pentameter at a time when most &#34;poetry&#34; is indistinguishable from prose except in the way the lines are arranged--who sounds, miraculously, astonishingly, colloquial (the particular mark of his genius). Many of these poems attain a perfection--Aubade, High Windows, This Be The Verse, others, all relatively well known--that literally staggers the imagination. As with the (classic) jazz to which Larkin was so devoted, in which the players continually found &#34;new&#34; notes to blow, and even created new musical vocabularies when the old ones were exhausted, Larkin finds boundless new resources inside the English language and then bursts poetry's integument asunder when his straightlaced, albeit eccentric, formalism seems to hem him in.<br /><br />Unlike most contemporary poets, Larkin creates lines you remember--indeed, cannot shake--and want to memorize for the delight, and mortification, of self and friends.<br /><br />Larkin does not, by the bye, deal in any manner of obscurantism. What he means is clearly on the page. It may not leave you in the sunniest of dispositions, but it will lift you, powerfully, to another level of poetic appreciation.<br /><br />This is a book for life by the major voice of my time.	2001-12-19

(&quot;Bookworm's Delight,&quot; right?)  Indeed. This particular  Bernie Rhodenbarr book--and, I surmise, the series in general--works at two levels, at least: as a rather straightforward genre whodunnit, but one infused with Block's clever writing and--I found--amusing dialogue (with enough lightly-tossed-off literary allusions to satisfy readers attracted by the book's bookish associations), Bernie Rhodenbarr's attractive &quot;honorable thief&quot; persona, the agreeable NY City 12th-and-Broadway book district locale. The Rhodenbarr book is also a gentle send-up of the whole damn genre, which surely needs sending up from time to time. To discuss at length any particular aspect of the fun Block has in doing so would be to deprive readers of their own pleasures of discovery, so I'll say no more.<br />What I most enjoyed, however--but what other readers have found particularly objectionable--is Block's use of the JD Salinger-Joyce Maynard materials. Sensing a kindred perspective, I for one am wholly with Block here, having read Maynard's original NY Sunday Times Magazine piece, wondering what the editor could have been smoking when s/he decided to print it, and rankled at how it came to pass that someone more than a decade younger than me--Maynard was 14--could be designated by the authoritative NY Times as the voice of MY generation!!! The nerve. Given my 35-year-old peeve, I LOVED the way Block has worked the Salinger-Maynard story and would, moreover, love to believe his insights were authentically based in fact. Alas, we--or at least I--will never know, but it's fund to conjure.<br />It's easy to recommend The Burglar in the Rye for the beach, for the airplane, or just as an afternoon's entertainment--yes, it is, in Block's larger oeuvre, an &quot;entertainment&quot; in Graham Greene's sense, as opposed to, say, the Matthew Scudder books, which are darker and more probing--a suitable distraction in a difficult time (exactly my purpose in picking it up), filled with sweetness, light, good cheer, and hardly anything--aside from a chaste lesbian romance--that the Legion of Decency would find objectionable.which are darker and more probing--a suitable distraction in a difficult time (exactly my purpose in picking it up), filled with sweetness, light, good cheer, and hardly anything--aside from a chaste lesbian romance--that the Legion of Decency would find objectionable.	2001-12-02

Rashid has covered Afghanistan for more than 20 years and has put a tremendous amount of information and analysis at the reader's disposal.<br />Apart from the most complete story of the rise of the Taliban--and the special conditions in Afghanistan that facilitated its rise--Rashid includes useful chapters on bin Laden, oil politics in Central Asia (the heart of what will remain the book's main value in the post-Taliban era), the status of women in Afghanistan, and a host of sensible observations about Afghanistan as a landlocked Central Asian state. Rashid's coinage--the &quot;New Great Game&quot;--which harks back to the &quot;tournament of shadows&quot; in which Russia and England sought to outduel the other in Central Asia, seems more than a little justified in light of the Caspian oil and gas finds that lie undeveloped in the ground and under the sea.<br />This book also will continue to be useful as providing a dollop of background information on &quot;all those names&quot; you've been seeing in the press--Gulbuddin Hekymatyr, Ismail Khan, Abdulrashid Dostam, Burhanuddin Rabbani, etc.--the whole pack of which hasn't changed since the war against the Soviets and is unlikely to change any time soon (with the exception of Ahmed Shah Masood, &quot;the Lion of the Panshir,&quot; who was assassinated, probably by bin Laden's &quot;Arab-Afghans,&quot; in September 2001).<br />Coming from a scholarly house--Yale University Press--with a full bibliography and footnotes, the book nevertheless suffers from production flaws that tempted me to subtract a star from my rating. The index is infuriatingly incomplete--the main material on an entry is often located on pages not indicated in the index. It's almost as though the indexer, hitting a name or a place for the third or fourth time, decided, &quot;hey, this looks like it might be pretty important,&quot; and started compiling entries at that point. A few spelling glitches and at least two howling typos in dating specific events seemed simply puzzling--how could Yale's editors have permitted this?<br />On balance, however, such shortcomings do little to distract from the considerable pleasures of discovery and understanding Rashid's excellent work affords.he third or fourth time, decided, &quot;hey, this looks like it might be pretty important,&quot; and started compiling entries at that point.

I'm amused by the observations of &quot;professional meteorologists&quot; and others who take offense at Brian Fagan's science. The Little Ice Age is more a storybook of hypotheses dressed out as plausible narratives than a scientific treatise. More importantly, it's an implicit paean to the sheer ingenuity of climatological researchers in building data sets--from tree rings, ancient ice cores, statisitical studies of cloud cover in European master paintings, and other hard-to-cull sources--to explore historical climate in general, and &quot;the little ice age&quot; in particular. Climatologists and meteorologists know all about the North Atlantic Oscillation (most of us have surely heard of El Ni&ntilde;o, the Southern Oscillation) but few of us understand how the interaction of the NAO, currents, and the secular tendencies of air movements have helped create history. Most readers, I suspect, will be hooked early in the book by the tales of Viking sailors' westward explorations, facilitated by warming that allows them literally to skip along the retreating Arctic ice toward cod fisheries newly abundant in the warmer western waters. These and other stories of climate related history--droughts, famines, disease, conquest, and on and on--give the reader a fresh appreciation for the raw interconnectedness of, well, everything. (The Little Ice Age is, moreover, a useful companion to Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, the admirers of which will find much to admire here.)<br />In addition to an occasional discursiveness that loses the reader in thickets of &quot;climate&quot; but little relationship to &quot;thesis,&quot; Fagan also slips in his final observations on global warming and how it fits into the long pattern of weather from 1300 to the present. Unfortunately for his own argument--the rather conventional one that accepts the abnormality of contemporary variation in warming due to human, as opposed to natural cyclical, activity--Fagan stumbles over the fact that current temperatures are still only APPROACHING those of the period antedating the little ice age, c. 1000-1200. That is, before industrialization, six billion earthly inhabitants, all those carbon emissions, and the rest.<br />These shortcomings are, however, an acceptable price to pay. Fagan is an eminent antropologist, bringing to this book a wealth of cross-disciplinary data and much light on many topics. He is, moreover, a lively and entertaining writer who is, therefore, quite easy to recommend. And I do, heartily.urrent temperatures are still only APPROACHING those of the period antedating the little ice age, c. 1000-1200.

It is, I suppose, a sad commentary on Congo that it is so readily recognizable in all three books, as the host for a succession of extractive, exploitative regimes, colonial and African. Wrong takes the litany of this inhuman expropriation to the present moment (and, if you read the headlines, you'll know the death of Laurent Kabila has resolved nothing...).<br />Happily, many, if not most, of Wrong's human subjects preserve, in her sympathetic account, their humanity. The struggle in so arduous an environment is to do precisely that, and it is the ultimate triumph of humanity that seeps out of the tale of how Congolese survived Mobutuism and, by extension, how Africans under a variety of authoritarian regimes endure from day to day. Not that they are assisted in any serious way by international institutions--Wrong's chapter on the IMF contains among the most damning stories in the book--and Congo's foreign &quot;relations.&quot; Wrong is a brilliant, witty observer, who tastefully disrupts the continual tale of woe with telling, often humorous, anecdotes on the theme of coping in the Congo.<br />Several very fine books on Africa have been published in the past several months, and this, plus Kapuscinski's Shadow of the Sun, are the best.	2001-08-09

Berkeley expressly criticizes popular writers like Robert Kaplan for keeping the conventional--and easily controvertible--wisdom in circulation. In doing so, and in  writing to correct the record, Berkeley deserves a pat on the back.<br />After these introductory passages, the book heads for mostly well worked territory in accounts of African ethnic conflicts Berkeley has, at some point, covered as a reporter (for Atlantic Monthly and other publications). He does this through the lens of six &quot;types&quot;--&quot;the rebel,&quot; &quot;the collaborator,&quot; &quot;the assistant secretary&quot;--each with its own chapter, some of which work better than others (such as the ones on Chester Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African for the entire Reagan Administration and errant practioner of Kissingerian realpolitik, and Gatsho Buthelezi, the Zulu leader who collaborated with South Africa's White Apartheid regime against the Mandela's African National Congress). In other chapters, however, Berkeley is hard-pressed to maintain this focus, especially since he seems determined to cut or stretch his material to give roughly equal attention to each conflict. Still, Berkeley provides reliable, informed overviews, filled out by personal anecdotes, interview material, and occasional gleanings from other scholarly or popular writers.<br />Some things irritate: I found his use of &quot;tribe&quot; and &quot;tribalism&quot; to be inconsistent, at times diffuse, first criticizing these terms as Western categories imposed on subservient peoples, and later using them conventionally (and, I would add, insensitively), without any suggestion that such usage may be in any way objectionable (at a time when &quot;tribe&quot; has been widely abandoned among Africanists in favor of, say, &quot;people&quot; or &quot;ethnic group&quot;). From time to time the text repeats itself, and Berkeley often returns to home themes artlessly (a problem of structure: if each of your chapters has the same basic point, you'll tend to repeat your punchlines unless you factor them into a common front end or conclusion). And Berkeley is at times too much the &quot;new journalist,&quot; gratingly front and center of his own narrative, wearing his progressive credentials and editorial opinions (he's now an editorial writer at the NY Times) on his sleeve, hatband, shoulderbag, and anywhere else he can hang them.<br />This is nevertheless a book that, apart from its other merits, gets its big concerns right, and for that reason alone I would  recommend it as a corrective to a lot of the nonsense on ethnic strife now in circulation.first criticizing these terms as Western categories imposed on subservient peoples, and later using them conventionally (and, I would add, insensitively), without any suggestion that such usage may be in any way objectionable (at a time when &quot;tribe&quot; has been widely abandoned among Africanists in favor of, say, &quot;people&quot; or &quot;ethnic group&quot;).

For these reasons alone, attention must be paid. (This is difficult advice to a nation of &#34;comfort readers,&#34; who--far from being provoked by their nighttime reading--love to curl up with a good Danielle Steele until the Sandman comes.) Whatever other functions a Davis book serves, it's an in-your-face test of the reader's mettle. ...<br /><br />Davis paints what seems to me a more than plausible vision of a Hispanic/Latino future that I'll bet you haven't given much thought to (unless you live in SoCal or along the southern border). One useful thing about demography is that a simple extrapolation will  get the analyst to several plausible hypotheses about things to come. This is one service Davis has performed. One of the useful mental exercises Davis sends you off on once he makes his preliminary case (of a Latino/Hispanic plurality by 2050) prompts you to comtemplate the coming contours of national level politics, immigration policy, relations with Central and Latin America--in other words, this book can rattle your mental universe. And his chapter on &#34;transnational suburbs&#34;--in which he analyzes bilocated Latino communities that, in our internet and cheap-transportation age, retain a deep involvement in both their native and immigrant communities--is, for me, worth the price of the book.<br /><br />This is a useful tutorial about the drift of our demographic destiny in a &#34;globalized&#34; world, but the picture Davis paints is by no means inevitable. Second and third generation immigrant communities tend to assimilate to the dominant culture through a variety of means (although Davis tends to argue that contemporary immigrant communities are driven by walls of discrimination back upon themselves in ways earlier immigrants in the second and third generations were not). The future is seldom, in any significant respect, a straight-line extrapolation of any trend. And Davis's great hope for the mobilization of the heretofore inchoate political might of the new immigrant communities--a revivified labor movement--seems, at best, a pipe dream, but one that more than a few commentators see well within the realm of possibility, as income differentials widen and a pronounced underclass sentiment proliferates among the have-nots.<br /><br />In all, a quick, stimulating, worthy read. And for those parents who wonder which language little Johnny should study in high school, or in his language immersion pre-school, David would probably say--and I'd have to agree--Spanish is a good choice.

Post-modernism didn't discover that &quot;meaning&quot; in &quot;texts&quot; is perfectly subjective. It's a proverbial insight--&quot;one man's meat is another man's...oh, baccala.&quot; But what about when the disposition of the subject--me, in this case--my very attitude toward the text, swings back and forth? I wind up with more than one view, don't I? It's not unusual to enjoy a work of art, an artifice, after all, at different levels or dimensions.<br />Hence a Dickensian prelude: The Dying Animal is the best of books, the worst of books. A fierce book, an insipid book. Visionary, jejune. Universal, hideously particularistic. Thrilling, disgusting. Soaring, gutter-dwelling. The sum of all these dichotomous parts, and more, is that protean art as literature. Roth packs a lot into 156 very tiny pages.<br />Art can be both brilliant and banal. Roth is characteristically, luminously courageous in describing a dark truth lurking in the center of the &quot;demonic male&quot; (pace to Wrangham and Petersen). He borders on banality with the heavy-handed irony of Consuela Castillo's predicament in the final quarter of the story. Moreover, &quot;the dying animal&quot; (pace Yeats, who raises the phrase twice) in an incomplete metaphor for the dirty old man David Kepesh has become. As perceptive as Roth is in having Kepehs identify MEN as in the end but simple denizens of the animal kingdon, the author makes a pointed choice of ducking the biological working out of Kepesh's logic. Roth focuses on animal lust and (the slightly more elevated) longing and IGNORES the procreative evolutionary biological compulsion that makes sense of lust and longing: no lust, no rise, no act, no species. In that light, things like family, responsibility, accommodation, and human empathy--all of which Kepesh pushes away, violently--pose new and compelling dilemmas that don't get treated here. If Roth's antiheroes are going to continue to be primordial alpha males driven by Ur-urges, Roth will have to reflect anew and assume on fresh stance on what makes David (and Nathan and Peter and Alexander and Mickey...and...and...) get up in the morning.<br />Roth would have fun doing it. No writer loads more ideas, unobtrusively, into his work. One of Roth's most cunning devices in The Dying Animal is to have David Kepesh colorfully recount the tale of the Morton-Bradford-Merry Mount controversy, which to Kepesh shows that S-E-X has been woven into the warp and woof of American life since year zero in the New World. In such passages--and also when narrator Kepesh propounds his hedonistic American univeralism--The Dying Animal becomes a short coda to Roth's American Trilogy (like the Prague Orgy is a coda to the Zuckerman books).<br />In all, bravura writing, familiar themes, moral dilemmas, classic  Roth.

You're uncertain that Malcolm Gladwell has been consistent in his exegesis of &quot;tipping&quot;--first it's a combination of three elements that together produce the &quot;tipping,&quot; then it's a mathematical point beyond which a incipient trend or fashion simply &quot;takes off.&quot; Then, no--it's a person who can &quot;tip&quot; a trend. But who cares? The book literally hurtles down its path, from one fascinating, intuitively pleasing, observation to the next.<br />Along the way, not only does Gladwell never raise the word &quot;memetics&quot; or &quot;meme&quot; (pace Richard Dawkins). He also skirts mentioning--and it seems inconceivable that he could write an entire this piece without ever having uttered--the term &quot;complexity&quot; (pace the whole Santa Fe crowd). The Tipping Point is all about emergence, path-dependence, increasing returns...in short, &quot;complexity science.&quot; Not to worry. Beautifully articulated, with page after page of new findings from a broad range of social science disciplines, all fattening the notion of &quot;tipping&quot; in the three key epidemiological dimensions--agent, substance, context--The Tipping Point is a breezy, jazzlike run through the hows and whys of taste, fashion, hipness, and other varieties of social contagion. Never mind that much of this sounds familiar from other contexts. You'll enjoy the ride and wind up with a settled sense of &quot;seeing through&quot; a lot that might have puzzled you just an hour earlier.<br />(And why is it you couldn't remember the content of that article on nutrition your girlfriend showed you just the other night? Gladwell knows. You can too. It'll save your relationshihp.)	2001-05-08

Great writers like Kapucinski--and he IS a very great writer, assisted by a great translator, Klara Glowczewska--teach us how to see, how to find the right context, how to set out the proper perspective. Most of those who read this book will be Westerners in search of a window. As an introduction, as an intimation of the myriads of Africas--because, as Kapucinski freely acknowledges, it's unfair,  and somewhat insulting, to speak simply of &#34;Africa&#34;--and, yes, as an interpretation for Western minds, readers could do no better than The Shadow of the Sun.<br /><br />For all his his vivid prose and artistic control of story elements, Kapucinski is a scholarly observer, a man who sees through the deep ice, seemingly an anthropologist refitted as a journalist--his eye is uncanny, his descriptive powers precise and powerful, and his range of experiences and depth of understanding makes this a uniquely valuable tutorial. He writes with clarity and fresh insight on familiar topics like Amin, Sudan, and the Rwanda genocide--his &#34;lecture&#34; on the events of 1994 is one of the book's many highpoints--but also on the sensations, struggles, and states of being that accompany the simple act of living in so challenging an array of environments as Africa's geography provides.<br /><br />Yes, Kapucinski does include exotica, but without sensationalizing: there are harrowing encounters with flora, fauna, disease, the elements and, again and again, the terrible heat (which he finds as many ways of describing as the proverbial Inuit has of describing snow). But Kapucinski always returns to human dimensions and conditions and, above all, to the patterns and rhythms and variations of human exchange around which life in the many Africas organizes itself. And, always, he seeks to convey and to understand the point of view of his many interlocutors, rather than to make facile attributions or easy generalizations.<br /><br />This is superb reportage and an essential document by a true master. It is to me staggering that, published by the same house as Robert Kaplan (of The Coming Anarchy fame) and sensitively covering the very turf that so alarmed Kaplan, Kapucinski remains comparatively unknown.

Allman's &quot;Miami: City of the Future,&quot; and Didion's book. Yeah, yeah, at the time, Miami was hot hot hot, Crockett and Tubbs were in the middle of their run, but...Iran-Contragate was also playing itself out, and Miami was an  epicenter of Reagan-era, better-dead-than-Red, Contra War intrigue. Didion captures the period beautifully in suitably ominous, conspiratorial tones. She introduces us to a cast of chilling characters--no, wait: she means for us to UNDERSTAND her characters as the driven, chilling, formidable products of &quot;el exilio&quot; and &quot;la lucha&quot;--and leaves no doubt that these are serious men, men who &quot;get things done,&quot; men capable of, well, anything.<br />And my bone? Didion is a wonderful writer who cannot, however, resist long, convoluted, patience-trying Germanic sentences, frontloaded with the universe, embellishing adjective after adjective, wending their way down the page, forestalling all gratification, clarity, or meaning, until finally hitting us between the eyes with the final word-punchline, which invariably leads our eyes to course back up the page in an effort to reconstruct, to rediscover &quot;just where were we going with this.&quot; Small price to pay for so delicious a book.	2001-04-17

I share his concerns. I join in his delight at the comeuppances that from time to time sock Disney in the jaw. (As a resident of Northern Virginia, I was quietly pleased at our qualified victory in beating back Disney's America project.) So let me say first that I'd recommend Team Rodent as sheer, exuberant Hiassen, with its &quot;Peep Land,&quot; &quot;Insane Clown Michael,&quot; odious black buzzards and other hilarious locales and characters.<br />Still, this is a slender book that wants you to believe it's much longer, better developed, and more convincing. It's Hiassen stretching everything he's got for as much as he can get (he's very good at this). He has an an anecdote or two for each short chapter, which he inflates--via the high-pressure air hose of Hiassenian hyperbole and prose--to the bursting point. What we're left with is the story of a large, powerful corporation in Florida behaving like--surprise!--a large, powerful corporation in Florida. That has convinced the broad masses to shovel money into its coffers in alarmingly large quantities. Surely, however, as a muckraker and satirist, Hiassen has divined something sinister, some fundamental filaments of rot eating through the Disney empire.<br />For better or worse, intellectuals are the guilty consciences of their times, and Hiassen performs this necessary service. His are the useful ravings of the &quot;anti-developmentals,&quot; who serve as salutary societal T-cells and, consequently, as needed brakes on hyperdevelopment. (It worked in Northern Virginia!) Hiassen behaves here, however, as though he had much more to work with and as though he didn't have to expend much effort to clinch his case--the &quot;preaching to the choir syndrome&quot;? In the end, Team Rodent seems something Hiassen simply tossed off one morning over coffee from his sanctuary in the Keys. I'd have appreciated a fuller version--with bull alligators, dire prophesies, and smacktalk intact--and a fair chance to judge whether this material's &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;entertaining&quot; quotients equal &quot;ultimately, compelling.&quot; Here it doesn't, not to a dispassionate observer.nce to judge whether this material's &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;entertaining&quot; quotients equal &quot;ultimately, compelling.&quot; Here it doesn't, not to a dispassionate observer.	2001-04-08

Motherless Brooklyn is delirious, overabundant, delightful creativity, with a strong, supple spine of research on Tourette's Syndrome to render palpably the faux detective Lionel Essrog, an unforgettable creation. This is literary jazz of the highest caliber: Lethem blows twelve bars of melody and takes off on soaring feats of improvisation, but always--whether carefully, or harrowingly, or softly, or howlingly humorously--bringing his daring rhetorical flights back home with great (and intuitively \\"fitting\\") imagination.<br /><br />Some reviewers have invoked the name \\"Nabokov\\" with reference to Motherless Brooklyn, praise that is not misplaced. Yes, this novel is squarely in the crime noir genre. Yes, Lethem might have situated his protogonist in any of half a dozen other genres. And, yes, locating a germ of \\"difference\\" and building standard materials around it is precisely what makes a \\"genre.\\" But Lethem's language--and his principal deployer of language, the Tourettic Lionel--is, like Nabokov's in Lolita and Pale Fire, literally miraculous. And the Tourette's difference is, as it must be, integral to the story (which, considered as crime fiction, by the way, is good: populated with believable characters and dialogue, a suitably tangled plot, and honest, satisfying resolutions).<br /><br />Read this novel. Tell your friends. Make Jonathan Lethem's name familiar in their mouths as household words. His is a gifted new voice that should be widely supported.<br /><br />(Thirteen years after - a reader's/movie lover's lament, turned to delight: Edward Norton has held the rights to Motherless Brooklyn since its publication in 1999, and since that time he has wanted to direct and star in the film adaptation.

His prose is pellucid, so much so that it's easy to skim the surface alone and simply glide along from one handsome sentence to the next. He's a &quot;jazzy&quot; writer whose usage is so fresh it sometimes feels improvised on the spot. He's also a playful writer and enjoys getting one (or two) over on his readers (never more so than in the New York Trilogy).<br />In these respects, Timbuktu is pure Auster. If you are among his admirers, you'll be gratified; if you're unfamiliar with him, it's as good a place as any to begin. If you're a doggie person, however, you're in for a particular treat. Unlike other writers who have tried and failed to create believable canine characters--Kristin Bakis and her disappointing Lives of the Monster Dogs comes to mind--Auster's Mr. Bones is convincingly realized (once you surrender to the well-deployed conceit that dogs understand everything we say). Within this bittersweet work are several hilarious scenes--mostly related to food--in which we see our dogs and ourselves as in a very bright light.<br />This is not simply the &quot;Dolorous Adventures of Willy and Mr. Bones,&quot; although it works at that level alone as a wonderfully entertaining, if ultimately bleak, picaresque. But Auster also has a lot to say about relationships, loyalty, loneliness, the quality of modern life, and more. And all in 181 quirky, quickly read pages.<br />In the context of Auster's diverse, unique oeuvre, Timbuktu is yet another sharp turn to new and unusual materials, wrought with the author's characterisitic originality. Woof.	2001-04-01

I say this not because Lent is one of those McCarthy clones who are suddenly populating the literary landscape, or that his writing is precisely reminiscent of anyone, but: the narrative materials are lifted straight out of Yoknapatawpha County, the lovely, lapidary prose sometimes recalls Updike, and the incisive, oblique observation and beautifully wrought violence contains whispers of McCarthy.<br />This, however, is clearly Faulkner country, transposed to New England: broad, dynastic, operatic, with tangled, busted lives,  &quot;sins of the fathers,&quot; thwarted redemption, miscegenation, deeply hatched plotting, and long stretches of psychological discovery. Lent transforms these raw materials into a work of unique beauty: his characters are vivid and memorable. His plotting and pacing strike me as signs of architectonic genius.  And his descriptive powers, directed to familiar objects--dew on a leaf, a sunset, a snowy vista--unscroll utterly unspoiled language in sinuous, carefully wrought sentences, making us &quot;see&quot; with his own keen eye for fresh metaphor, the kind of virtuoso writing that stops us dead--&quot;HOW could he have done that????&quot;--in much the same way as passage after passage of Mozart have overpowered generations of admirers.<br />Stay with this book: The languid beginnings of In the Fall reproduce the numbing routine of Norman Pelham's rural life--not since Cather's My Antonia have I so deeply perceived the sheer, isolated brutality of a 19th century winter--but, in the following section, with the arrival of Norman's son in the dangerous city, the book's pulse picks up, indeed hurtles, forward, and forward, to a harrowing finale.<br />Here is essential American literature, and a name to remember: Jeffrey Lent, Faulkner of the Northlands.	2001-01-26

Coetzee doesn't sensationalize or render in graphic detail the intimate relations of his characters, but he wants you to understand that, at every critical juncture, his story advances as the consequence of biological, mostly male, imperatives. However biology, or genetic inheritance, may predispose behavior or shape character, it does not eliminate the need for choice. Ultimately, Coetzee's all too human principals take matters into their own hands. Moreover, Coetzee masterfully interweaves the eponymous &quot;disgrace&quot; of David Lurie into what becomes a tale of, and despairing comment on, post-apartheid South Africa.<br />The novel moves briskly and, unless we pause from time to time, we're likely to miss the irony that abounds in Coetzee's South Africa. Following the protagonist's disgrace, when he goes to his daughter's farm for an extended sojourn--setting up a city-country juxtaposition in which everything Lurie is has its counterpoint in his daughter's manner of life--the ironies begin to pile upon each other in a way that some may find forced. Moreover, in an otherwise starkly realistic novel, Coetzee tests the boundaries of the &quot;believable&quot; in several plot twists, one that is strictly second order business but another that is absolutely necessary to the outcome.<br />That said, this is compelling fiction by a mesmerizing writer. Coetzee has a particular gift for dropping words and phrases into place that implant not merely an exact thought but a complete mindset or frame of reference. Of course, we're all accustomed to &quot;understanding&quot; an author, but I cannot say, until now, that I've ever felt so strongly that &quot;I literally see exactly what you mean.&quot; Brief, precisely wrought observations on aging or on the relationship between men and their domestic beasts, to take but two examples, unlocked for me not the proverbial &quot;world of meaning&quot; but a seemingly literal reproduction of the author's mind--an eerie, almost mystical effect of words running across a page. For careful readers, there is magic here.e exactly what you mean.&quot; Brief, precisely wrought observations on aging or on the relationship between men and their domestic beasts, to take but two examples, unlocked for me not the proverbial &quot;world of meaning&quot; but a seemingly literal reproduction of the author's mind--an eerie, almost mystical effect of words running across a page.

Fitzgerald presumes the reader knows something, and cares, about the late 18th Century context; she hopes we might be stimulated by imagining contemporaries of Fichte and Kant discussing their ideas; she presumes that, to us, &quot;romanticism&quot; is more than a word or a line from Shelly and that, by recovering, or compiling, everyday details from a time and world long lost, she can help us understand the romantic sensibility and, ultimately, Hardenberg's--and our--ambiguous longing for &quot;the Blue Flower.&quot;<br />I particularly enjoyed Fitzgerald's vignette approach--55 short chapters, each of which is a set piece, generally with a wry punchline--which allows Fitzgerald to view Friedrich von Hardenberg's improbable romance at odd angles. I for one marvel at this choice of subject, a decision by a professional author as seemingly improbable and hopelessly romantic as the subject itself.<br />And yet, despite the author's absolute mastery of her material, her strong cast of winning characters, and the wonderful--although irretrievably high-brow--sense of humor suffusing the entire narrative, I never felt myself emotionally drawn in. One reads on because each page is delightful, and, for many readers (obviously, me included) this is sufficient. But on the basis of slender narrative evidence, we are expected to understand, rather than led toward empathy with, Hardenberg and his inconceivable attachment. Perhaps Fitzgerald's plan was, in writing the simplest of love stories, to avoid cluttering the universe with additional examples of cheap sentimentalism, leaving us with a &quot;mystery of love.&quot; In different hands, the novel clearly might have become just that--dismissively sentimental. Instead, she goes the other way: Fitzgerald is a cool observer keenly attuned, in a very modern sense, to the ironies her story poses, but she never truly enages our hearts.love.&quot; In different hands, the novel clearly might have become just that--dismissively sentimental.

Needless to say, Jin's lives are warped by external political and sociocultural forces, but, to a much greater extent than such works as Chen Jo-hsi's wonderful The Execution of Mayor Yin and whole shelves of memoirs from the Cultural Revolution decade, Waiting underscores the possibility of human relationships during a &quot;scoundrel time.&quot; Although the book's final third moves toward outcomes that are somewhat trite and predictable, Ha Jin is a carefully observant guide who details the mores and folkways of his native society in anthropological detail, using these details in dabs to create a delicately wrought pointillistic tableau. Waiting satisfies at several levels and deserves a broad readership, and not only among admirers of literary fiction but, particularly, in undergraduate sociology and political science courses that now depict the Cultural Revolution, and Chinese society of the Mao period in general, either through horror stories or hagiograhical tales of failed idealism. Ha Jin's book has an honest texture of true lives lived.	2001-01-02

What we have here are images of mutual devotion--dogs and owners--that also neatly capture their respective eras. Ms. Hall's collection is a joy to repeatedly visit and has delighted everyone with whom I've shared it. It is, moreover, not simply for dog lovers; it's enough to have the &quot;old photograph fancy,&quot; because every picture here tells a rich tale and has great period detail. Nevertheless, doggie people--and, in particular, the host of Jack Russell Terrier folk--will cherish this book for a lifetime. (Many of the pictures in this collection are of Jacks of every body type and coat. And one of Ms. Hall's old pictures captures what I am, ah, certain is a British ancestor of my own fuzzy Jack.) I predict &quot;Prince: And Other Dogs...&quot; will be in print for a long, long time; those fortunate enough to discover it will buy numerous copies and hand them out liberally. Finally, Prince and Other Dogs is a fabulous bargain, attractively bound, fitting nicely in the hand, with photographs lovingly reproduced on heavy paper. An ideal gift.	2000-12-10

I have admired Alan Bloom--here thinly disguised as Abe Ravelstein--for many years: preferred his translations, went to hear him when he  came to town, appropriated his views from time to time, tediously lectured my family at table from Closing of the American Mind. Hence, having been seduced by the rolling  waves of publicity that preceded publication--and untroubled by the AIDS/outing question--I took up the book to make a closer  acquaintance with a great man. I suppose I should have waited for the biography. By now it has become  commonplace to observe that the strongest portions of this book are in the reminiscences  of Bellow's alter ego, Chick, on the Ravelsteinian largeness--of being, character, appetite, intellect.  The weakest, occupying some two-thirds of the narrative, are Bellow's  maundering complaints about Chick's love life. For me, these passages all too often conjured the troubling image of the octogenarian author first as puzzled cuckold, then as shameless lecher, slavering over--and a'wooing as he  slavers--his young female assistant. Feh! This fatal imbalance of unappealing to appealing  material made for a disjointed, almost wholly unsatisfying reading experience. Although Ravelstein is not  without traces of the Bellovian wit and penetrating observation, it really must be said that this work is but mere  scratchings compared to Bellow's major fiction. Ordinarily, I would say, &quot;Bad Bellow (or  Roth, e.g.) is better than good almost Anyone Else.&quot; Not here. If you must, read the first  third, then put this book down...in favor of something by Bloom himself.	2000-11-28

No, I plainly adore this short, carefully wrought, multiple-prize winning jewel of a novel. Cunningham inhabits Virginia Woolf, brings her back to us, dives deeply, languorously into character via Woolf's trademark reverie and reflection, gives us in the span of 227 brief pages a clutch of believable women and men, each teetering on the brink of a personal abyss. And yet, and yet. Not many chuckles here save an occasional wryly mordant observation, no hustle-bustle, no wasted energy--only a supremely wise, stately, moving, perfectly balanced and sequenced tableaux of setpieces that might have been subtitled &quot;The Dalloway Variations.&quot; Many have pointed out, with surprise, that this...this MAN...writes female characters that thoroughly convince. Well, so do, of course, Henry James, Wallace Stegner, Brian Moore, Robertson Davies (when he wants), a long list of others--but Cunningham's economy and diamond-hard precision astonishes on every page, free of fluff, shorn of any trace of excess, laserlike and true. Yes, he carefully observes and captures his women, but, you must forgive me for observing, with a left-handed, mathematical elegance that is unmistakably male. All this, and a killer punch line to boot. Yes, heartbreaking. Yes, in the end, staggering. Genius? You judge. Devour this in a sitting, buy copies for friends.<br />(I had originally wanted to dock Cunningham a star for his utter ransacking of Woolf--for plot material, character names and situations, everything but mise en scene. Alas, I could not: unlike his cut and polished prose, I am insufficiently hard.)	2000-11-28

One reason: for white  supremacists, certain strains of &quot;militarist,&quot; and other politically incorrect personalities,  this book has evident appeal (Scribners marketed its 1975 edition as &quot;a chilling novel  about the end of the white world.&quot; Interested?) Or you may have first encountered Raspail as an  interesting citation in readings on global poverty, humanitarian crises,  worldwide food relief, transnational migration. Or you may have turned to Camp of the  Saints because one or more knowledgeable friends have urged you to check it out (as was my case).<br />You should, in any event, know what you're getting into, and consider the source (and the  agenda) of the recommending authority. This is a difficult book to praise: it is among  the longest 300 pp books I've read. To wit: its sustained tone--bitter, sarcastic, polemical--recalls the  worst rhetorical excesses of its rhetorically excessive moment of creation and, ultimately, becomes  unbearable in the final third, competing with, and ultimately overwhelming, its narrative  drive. It is filled with set pieces from knee-jerk conservatism's central-caricature casting  office. It lingers long on the debauchery of its nameless, faceless (with few exceptions) Ganges migrants and of the denizens of the Hobbesian, Clockwork Orange future it paints. Anticipating &quot;multiculturalism&quot; and &quot;diversity,&quot; it asks the reader to approve, with the author and narrator, the phrase &quot;universal mongrelization&quot; as an accurate characterization of the  fate of the &quot;white race.&quot;<br />That said, The Camp of the Saints has undeniable power. Raspail poses uncomfortable  questions on virtually every page. Other reviewers have summarized these, which revolve  around racial affinities and the dilemma of liberal societies, posed--at the same time Raspail was setting his book down--by Harvard political  philosopher Harvey Mansfield: Liberal democracy is that regime which can choose  anything but itself. Over and over again, Raspail confronts the reader: what do you think  about this? And this? And here, this as well? What would YOU do? What then?  The context Raspail is responding to--apparent to readers 25 years ago--is important. Keeping a few contextual details in mind will sensitize today's readers to the fears that animated Raspail's generation and will help them (in particular, those too young to remember the &quot;revolutionary moment&quot; of the late '60s and early '70s) stay with the book: fear of global overpopulation (Erlich's Population Bomb), global starvation (the Club of  Rome), student revolution (Franz Fanon at the sit-in, Daniel  Cohn-Bendit [&quot;Danny the Red&quot;], hippies, yippees), race war (Black Power, guns at Cornell, &quot;Gestapo raiding pigs&quot;), etc. Taken together, this is, of course, the long menagerie of 1960s-1970s  favorite freaks, rolling over us, slowly.<br />Thoughtful people should read and decide.

Wilson composed this towering essay nearly 25 years ago to further develop ideas and relationships proposed in the final pages of his Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. A quarter of a decade later, it continues  to startle: in the clarity of its exposition, the aptness of its metaphors, the range of its learning, and, finally, the monumental power  marshaled in support of its argument--that human behavior is largely controlled by our species' biological heritage.<br />For social scientists, one of Wilson's most provocative, and useful, proposals is that  biology should serve as the &quot;anti-discipline&quot; to the social sciences; that is, evolutionary biology is at an adjacent level of disciplinary  organization, operating underneath the social sciences with the potential for reorganizing the disciplines above it according to its  own principles. To a great extent, in the ensuing quarter decade, largely because Wilson and his colleagues have successfully  defended the perspective of sociobiology, this has become the case in at least two fields: the new discipline of  evolutionary psychology has flourished, and a new generation of anthropologists have also taken up evolutionary biology as part of their  methodological toolbox. On the other hand, economists, political scientists, and sociologists have arguably lagged behind in  making the relevant connections.<br />To understand where the social sciences need to go in the 21st century, On Human  Behavior remains an indispensable key (together with and Mitch Waldrop's Complexity, still the most successful introduction to  complexity science, although the competition is strong). Moreover, this book (and Waldrop's) should be on every undergraduate's reading list. Even if you decide you disagree with Wilson's argument and  conclusions, in toto or in part--and I do (in part), believing, for example, that Wilson lets reproductive strategies overdetermine  human behavior, leading him to undervalue cultural evolution (although I surmise he would deny this)--you should purchase this book  for the elegance of its writing, which will ease you into a confrontation with your own dearly held views about the constituents  of &quot;human nature.&quot;although I surmise he would deny this)--you should purchase this book  for the elegance of its writing, which will ease you into a confrontation with your own dearly held views about the constituents  of &quot;human nature.&quot;	2000-11-11

And Nietzsche, in penetrating the master and slave mentalities of the classical world and in identifying Christianity as Platonism for the Masses, captured and unfolded the martial side of the classical mind with great sensitivity. In an epic context of great empires and desperate battles, Stephen Pressfield has made palpable this psychological universe, that of glory-bound warrior Spartans and their stolid, silently suffering women, at a more popular and accessible--albeit still &quot;literary&quot;--level. Those who have done any mucking about in the sources will find this an almost wholly plausible rendition of the Spartan mind. Apart from his hyper-romanticization of Sparta (in an effort, I surmise, to correct a historical record that consistently points to the cruel, overregimented &quot;Spartan&quot; life) and from seeming to extend, anachronistically, the humanity of Periclean Athens' to Sparta, Pressfield wonderfully evokes a world long lost and provides a long, thrilling--and, in the end, moving--account of the famed, hopeless battle between the Spartan 300 (and allied cities) and Xerxes irresistible Persian might. If you've ever wondered what happens to the surface of a dry-baked battlefield when it is traversed by thousands of warriors, flooded by freshets of blood and piss and guts, for days, you've probably been waiting for this one. Pressfield's writing continually surprises and illuminates, at several levels, in its crisp diction, historical reconstructions, deep characterizations, sharp and unhacknied descriptions of action, and in its overall psychological perceptiveness. Creative history instructors would be well advised to assign Gates of Fire, thereby rousing their students' imaginations and animating their classroom discussions.	2000-07-15

Earth is not only a spectacularly readable novel. It gets things  &quot;right,&quot; in the sense that the extrapolations are plausible (some  might say &quot;conservative&quot;), the science (even the fictional  &quot;cavitronics&quot;) seems, to this layman, sound, the social milieux  are eminently reasonable and closely observed. Importantly for this work,  Brin more than a decade ago had a clear picture of the internet's potential  power, and the web is here a central character. So too is Earth itself, in  many guises--in fact, the novel can double as a delightful tutorial on  various &quot;green&quot; topics. Moreover, Brin's theme of  &quot;competition and cooperation&quot; as the engine of evolution and of  complex emergent behaviors, human and otherwise, is brilliantly worked  throughout the narrative. (And I've said nothing about the lucidly wrought,  believable characters that thickly inhabit this long, ambitious, and  carefully plotted work.) Some readers may complain the climax contains a  touch of deus ex machina, but, in the story's context, it all works.  Indeed, at the conclusion, you feel &quot;everything fits, everything  matters, everything affects everything else.&quot; Bravo, bravo, bravo.	2000-06-30

Books	5	9	10	N	N	Provocatively Entertaining	David Brin has a lot to say and says it discursively, but he's done his homework--dipping into an impressive range of social science, philosophical, crytographic, and technical literature--thought carefully,  marshalled compelling arguments seasoned with humor and bright metaphors,  and, as a result, is worth listening to, arguing with, or simply pondering.  The Transparent Society works out, with much supporting detail, ideas about  secrecy and privacy first raised in Brin's magisterial novel, Earth, and  does so in a civilizational context. I risk doing Brin and his book grave  injustice by oversimplifying, but let me say Brin views  &quot;accountability&quot; and &quot;criticism&quot; as central to the  progress of neo-Western civilization (fight the power!) and further posits  that criticism works very like T-cells in an immune system, providing (to a  greater and greater extent as the collective grows in knowledge) autonomous  and impersonal correctives against all manner of &quot;error.&quot; Brin  argues for greater informational transparency--almost total  disclosure--observing that, if universal surveillance cameras and other  snoop technologies are inevitable (and they almost certainly are), then a  generalized oversight capability, or a mutual surveillance capacity (in  other words, my ability to watch the government with the same technologies  that the government can watch me) is the answer to the classic question,  quis custodiet ipsos custodes (who shall guard the guardians?)?  In short,  we all will.  Brin's ingenious argumentation may strike some readers as  cavalier or reductionist. It's not. It's serious and is, moreover,  and a  serious response to flamewar proponents of &quot;encryption as the  answer&quot; to the privacy dilemmas of the wired age.	2000-06-30

A brave undertaking, to be sure, and the first two  chapters in which this story unfolds--first through an account of a budding  friendship between Silk and Roth's alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, then in a  flashback to Silk's youth in East Orange, New Jersey--are typically  brilliant Roth: acerbic social commentary, mordantly incisive confessional  observations, engaging ideas cloaked in simply beautiful writing. The  second chapter is itself a powerful, finely wrought tale. For me, however,  the book looses its way and its power, in two dimensions:  in the narrative  choices Roth makes--repeatedly chopping up Silk's story into multiple,  shifting points of view, that seemingly &quot;pad&quot; the narrative with  the doings of less consequential characters--and in the characters  themselves: unsympathetic, at times simply unbelievable, and motivated  implausibly, or, alternatively, all too predictably. Although I welcome  Roth's continued attention to the American social scene, and to the  particularly American pathologies that in Roth's recent work derange worthy  Americans, if one more inhabitant of the Rothian universe pitches Nathan  Zuckerman with a story that needs telling, that only Nathan can tell, I  swear, I won't buy the resulting book. (But of course I will. Because  Roth's our great master and chronicler, and because mediocre Roth surpasses  very good anything else.)	2000-06-30

Now having  read the thing, I can see what all the fuss is about; by the final chapter,  the counterintuitive idea that (under clearly specified conditions)  &quot;rigorous pursuit of your customer's interest can indeed sink your  firm&quot; seems as inevitable as the sunrise. Moreover, reading  Christenson now, as Wall Street lurches through the Era of Dot.Com/Madness,  it's easy to believe the book, and Chapter Nine in particular, has served a  hefty percentage of recent internet start-ups as a template for mapping the  market and assessing whether the technology offered is sufficiently  disruptive. (Christenson's use of the term &quot;technology&quot; is  process-related and more than just the latest widget).  As a public sector  drone, I was further impressed that Christenson's analytic approach is  broadly, if metaphorically, applicable to a range of  organizations--non-profit, non-commercial, public--trying to keep from  being overrun by the forces of change. Some critics have pooh-poohed  Christenson's analysis as old wine in a new bottle--&quot;what's the big  deal about successful firms having difficulty dealing with the low end of  their markets?&quot; etc.--but the lucid writing, clear plan, well-sprung  analytic framework (particularly the integration of &quot;value  networks&quot; and &quot;technology trajectories&quot;), and compelling  marshaling of case material make this an enjoyable, often revelatory, and,  yes, innovative dissection of how great firms become undone by new  technologies.	2000-05-08

Don't be put off by the author's undisguised, unvarnished, old-fashioned Marxist biases--Chairman Mao once  observed, &quot;we Marxists disdain to conceal our views,&quot; and Davis  makes his clear--because he's spot on:  this is a city built by scoundrels  on a foundation of perfidy and  despoliation. Not a novel observation,  true; mainstream historians, scores of journalists of every persuasion,  and, yes, Roman Polanski also point this out, but Davis's narrative has far  splashier colors and a high entertainment quotient. Alas, the book drops  one star for what I judge to be its  unevenness--the first two chapters are  brilliant, the concluding chapter on Fontana is very fine, the remainder  simply less so but still worthy. (Another, minor, beef--the excellent  photographs, and there are many, are not given very respectful  reproduction.) That said, City of Quartz is an indispensible tour of some  of the darker corners of LA's famous story and an informative guide for  those who have long looked for help in articulating precisely &quot;why I  really, really don't like Los Angeles.&quot;	2000-03-30

He correctly views each side's waxing and  waning influence as a function of situational strategic advantage--first in  the US-Chinese-Soviet &quot;strategic triangle&quot; and, later,  bilaterally--and shows how changes in global politics affect mutual  perceptions of interest and thus drive changes in policy. Lucid,  well-researched (although Ross's frequent use of Chinese  &quot;scholarly&quot; sources--which are often little more than official  documents under the imprimatur of the Beijing bishopric--has its periodic  down-side), and convincingly argued, this is the essential title on the  topic.	1999-04-25

Critics will call his subject matter what they will--Wright's characteristic &quot;issues,&quot; &quot;concerns,&quot; obsessions,&quot;  &quot;interests,&quot; &quot;passions&quot;--and will either praise or damn  him for working/reworking/rerereworking related materials.  I found many  powerful images powerfully rendered, and instances of beautiful writing.  Wright is, moreover, a fine aphorist and a cunning dialectician--&quot;What  we refuse defines us&quot;--who will appeal to those who toiled to master  those difficult authors. That said, overall, Black Zodiac in my estimation  falls well short of meriting the almost universal acclaim accorded by the  professional poetry fraternity/sorority (it is wholly unoriginal of me to  observe that this is a customary rewark bestowed on the work of long  persevering colleagues).  Wright gives us entirely too much on his personal  sacrifice:  the impossibility of poetry, the indescribability of a nature  and landscapes that surpass our small rhetorical ability to encompass, the  hackneyed insistence that &quot;a line of poetry's a line of blood&quot;  (Yes, YES! Fight on, regardless of the toll one's fragile psyche must  endure), on custodianship of The Word, on the meaninglessness of it all,  despite...and still.  Come on.  I'd like to read more of Charles Wright's  work, and will--if only to try to get to the place where Helen Vendler,  Harold Bloom, and others of his admirers view him--and I expect to  encounter his &quot;characteristic subject matter&quot;: landscapes,  clouds, ash (and lots of it), -wash,  Chinoiserie, light/dark  juxtapositions, recollection and loss, and ruminations on meaninglessness  and mortality that come knee-high to Philip Larkin's second best writing.  But I also expect a payoff in beautifully sculpted phrases and a few  aphoristic nuggets.	1999-01-04
US	52793993	R24CHYL0MNQQ7Y	0395933463	870258224	I Married a Communist	Books	5	40	47	N	Y	The Zuckerman Project II--A Superb New Novel	&quot;All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&quot;  In many respects, the two most recent novels of Philip Roth represent a long meditation on Tolstoi's famous observation  and suggest a common wellspring of the unhappy family narratives.  Roth  goes as far as to put Tolstoi's words into the mouth of Murray Ringold, the  high school English teacher who taught Roth's alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman,  the virtues of &quot;cri-ti-cal thinking&quot; and who, near the end of his  life some fifty years later, unfolds the fate of his brother Ira, the radio  personality &quot;Iron Rinn&quot; and young Nathan's boyhood mentor.  Forget what you have read about I Married a Communist as Roth's roman a  clef payback for Claire Bloom's recent memoire of her difficult life with  the novelist. It is much, much more and is of a thematic and emotional  fabric with Roth's great American Pastoral.  Roth's project, of which this  is the second installment, now seems to be &quot;Nathan Zuckerman's  America,&quot; thickly textured stories of lives collectively deranged and  rendered  dysfunctional by America and its political demons, now  the  MacCarthy era, Red-hunting, and the blacklist.  Along the way we have  countless carefully observed digressions on, among other things, taxidermy,  how to make &quot;literature,&quot; New Jersey's geology, the power of  &quot;the word,&quot; the triumph of lowbrow, and (of course) Newark in the  'forties and 'fifties.  One remains in awe of Roth's undiminished ability  to mine his own experience, augmented by prodigious research, to turn out  superb, universal novels like I Married a Communist. Is he our greatest  novelist?  Consider the oeuvre--Portnoy, The Zuckerman tetralogy (which  includes the magical The Ghost Writer), The Counterlife, Sabbath's Theater,  American Pastoral, and now this--and compare his accomplishment to that of  any living American writer.  It isn't even close.	1999-01-01

History resonates deeply thoughout Harwell's encounters  with the variety of Balkan types.  After a few pithy exchanges like,  &quot;Where is Serbia?&quot;  &quot;Whereever Serbians live,&quot;  contemporary events begin to drop clearly into place.  Rich  characterizations, authentic locales and landscapes, dense, almost  anthropological observations, and the most chaste of romantic entanglements  make this a rewarding, agreeably languorous, novel.	1998-09-11

Some historians and journalists, like John Keegan or Cornelius Ryan, get inside this frame to write wholly satisfying accounts of battle, but in my view, nothing succeeds quite like Thomas Flanagan in his astonishing debut as a novelist.  Next month in fact marks the 200 anniversary of that fateful year, which Flanagan has salvaged from history's footnotes to render as a perfect work of historical fiction.  In his hands, Humbert's &quot;invasion&quot; of Ireland, the United Irish army, its men, their stories, and their destiny at the hands of Cornwallis--yes, that Cornwallis, beautifully brought to life--and Lake make the most compelling reading.	1998-07-28

If falling in love with a whore and avenging her death on her pimp make for trite material, no one is capable of working this out like McCarthy.  His dialogue is spot on, the southwestern argot authentic (I lived in El Paso late in the '60s; I know these by God voices), the characters--especially the world-weary pimp Eduardo--superbly written.  (Love that &quot;She is whore to the bone.&quot;)  That said, the descent into a murky, quasi-Jungian/crypto-Berkeleyan idealism, in which dreams are real and history is created anew and ends over and over--I was listening for the philosopher's tree falling in the remote forest to come crashing down on these solipsistic passages--marked a sappy and ponderous finale.  Still, don't miss this novel--with Philip Roth, McCarthy's our best and is worthy of your support--but expect neither Blood Meridian nor All the Pretty Horses, both great great American novels.	1998-06-05

Terrific premise, title, cover art, and a natural hook for all doggie people, but, apart from an occasional sniff or switch of the ears, these aren't dogs--one wonders if the author has spent any time with any dog at all--and this isn't very good writing.  Indeed, Bakis writes the absolutely worst dialogue I've read in a published work by a major house; she has her heroine, Cleo, dining with the dogs, at which time they bore themselves with inane, contrived, wooden, conversation.  On at least three separate such instances, I wanted to fling Lives across the room.  Almost unbearable.  Skip this book.  Spend your book dollars on Philip Roth's masterful American Pastoral	1997-06-22
