This is a fascinating reshaping of the academic discussion [or to use the current jargon, \\"discourse\\"]on Latin American literature. To read Gonzalez Echevarria is to be dazzled by erudition and his true passion for Latin American letters and culture.  Aficionados of Latin American literature who study this work will undoubtedly be humbled by Gonzalez Echevarria's scholarly stamina and provoked by his insights. <br /> <br />The insights themselves are worth careful consideration.  Distancing himself from the traditional, chronological approach to Latin American narrative, and expressly by-passing a few \\"milestone works\\" that are perhaps less significant to the development of Latin American letters than is traditionally posited (e.g \\"Amalia\\", \\"Maria\\"), Gonzalez argues that the greatest shapers of Latin American narrative have been a few key works that in form and rhetoric embody the trends of the \\"hegemonic discourse\\" that dominated Latin America at different periods in the region's history.  During the colonial era, Gonzalez argues, the predominant form of writing in the region was the legal document.  Correspondingly, he argues, the salient literary texts of the period took on the forms, rhetoric and tones of legal discourse (e.g Bernal Diaz' \\"Historia Verdadera de La Conquista de Nueva Espana,\\" El Inca Garcialaso's \\"Commentarios Reales,\\").  During the 19th Century--his so-called 2nd Conquest of Latin America--the \\"hegemonic discourse\\" was scientific observation;  more specifically, the travel writings of Europeans and Americans who viewed Latin American flora, fauna, and customs through a scientific lense.  Correspondingly, Gonzalez argues, the salient Latin American works of the period (e.g. Sarmiento's \\"Facundo,\\" or Euclides da Cunha's \\"Os sertoes\\")seek to define phenomena in their respective societies while using the structures, form and rhetoric of the predominant scientific-travel writing.  In the 20th Century, he argues, works are shaped by the concerns and observations made by anthropology and ethnography.  Here he cites Gallego's \\"Dona Barbara\\" and Carpentier's  \\"Los Pasos Perdidos\\", as well as Miguel Barnet's testimonial novels. <br /> <br />Gonzalez suggests that thematically Latin American narrative has consistantly sought the region's cultural legitimacy and ownership of a mythic origin, a source of Latin America's true identity.  This search for a mythic origin has generally been conducted through the hegemonic discourses that he describes.  Gonzalez illustrates his point through key modern works by Borges, Carpentier, and Garcia Marquez--works which he shows are entirely conscious of the shifts in hegemonic discourse and the search for origins/identity. <br /> <br />The work is generally a joy to read, and makes the lone, lay  reader long for an animated discussion of Gonzalez' ideas around a seminar table.  There are times, however, when the author lapses into the worst forms of academic obfuscation and post-modern excess, and when he does so he undermines the goodwill that his work engenders.  A case in point-- in a discussion of Facundo, Gonzalez states:  \\"What Sarmiento has found in his voyage of discovery and self-discovery is a present origin, one that speaks through him, hollowing out the voice of his scientific language.  His authority will not be attained by it, but by the tragic sacrifice of his protagonist, which he re-enacts in the text.  This tragic fusion is a reflection of the linear time introduced by the evolution of nature, which brings everything to an end, inexorably, so that it will be reborn in a different guise.\\"  This passage, while not representative of the whole book, is simply preposterous, wound as it is in obscurity and the solipsism of contemporary academic criticism.  Passages such as this are particularly frustrating given that, in this instance,  Sarmiento's \\"protagonist\\" is a historical figure, and the notion that Sarmiento is \\"reenacting\\" Facundo's fate is entirely a construction of the critic.  Such analysis plays well in academia, but it is entirely removed from probable \\"authorial intent.\\"  [And yes, I acknowledge that the concept of \\"authorial intent\\" is now considered antiquated and naive in literary circles.  But historians who have studied Facundo would be maddened by this passage.]  In other works (i.e. \\"Celestina's Brood\\"), Gonzalez has argued that the Baroque is the most suitable mode for Latin American cultural expression. Perhaps in keeping with this conclusion, he himself occasionally engages in \\"gongorismo\\" that, while arguably culturally consistant, adds little to a sense of understanding. <br /> <br />Ultimately, however, these lapses are only intermittent, and they do not spoil the insightful treasures and the intellectual thrills that Gonzalez provides.  This book is a joy.	2005-02-18

He is entitled to his therapy, but we should all stop calling this repetitive formula literature.	2004-06-30

This novel is fascinating for the insights that it provides on Argentine life and thought in the early and mid 19th century.  The supporting characters are all fascinating and cleverly depicted.  The lead characters, however, are ciphers.  They are wooden figures bearing the weight of 19th century romanticism and the burden is too much for them.<br />If you love Argentina or are fascinated by 19th century Latin American historical developments, then this is a good book for you.  If you are a student of Latin American literature you probably ought to read the book, as many claim that it is the first &quot;novel&quot; written in South America.  Either way, you will see theories expounded as to why dictatorship took over the recently independent Argentina;  perspectives on what Marmol thought should constitute the Argentine nation ( and what should not); and portraits of a society living in fear of a brutal political regime.<br />If none of the above is germane for you, then you may be better off skipping this novel, as you will also have to deal with occasional digressions, overwrought prose, and annoyingly idealized lead characters.  If you are not a fan of Romantic literature, by-pass this one.	2004-06-29

This book is actually a collection of very short essays and snippets from newspaper articles.  There are opinions put forth but very little analysis that is grounded in theory.  Furthermore, some of the essays, while offering interesting insights, also present their respective authors' mistaken understandings of some of the history of Harvard and Racliffe, and the mistakes undermine the articles' cogency.  One also wonders how the editor went about selecting which essays/ remembrances to include and whether others were conveniently left out.<br />All in all, this book comes across as both cheap and weak intellectually.

Superficially, the work is a murder mystery that focuses on a jaded cop's transformation as he interacts with a mysterious individual whom he meets while investigating the murder of a transvestite.  Along the way, the novel raises interesting points about the various faces/masks that individuals wear depending upon given situations and the people with whom the individuals are interacting.  The novel explores the need to create, zeros in on the thin line between friendship and romantic love, and teases the reader with notions of sexual ambiguity.<br />\\"Mascaras\\" is a quick and easy read.  Unfortunately, it also raises issues in an off-handed mannaer without exploring them in any great depth.  This superficiality is a disappointment, for the issues are interesting and Padura clearly has ideas that are worth the reader;s though.  But without deeper exploration, the reader is left with unanswered questions and the prosaic and easily predictable police narrative.	2003-01-07

When Carlos Fuentes writes well, he is a joy to read.  When, however, he wants to demonstrate how learned he is, his writing is insufferable.  This novel falls into the latter category.  It is ostentatiously erudite and belches Fuentes' obsessions with highly esoteric questions.  It is a cold, inhuman novel, devoid of warmth, fascinated by the process of narration itself and ultimately overly intellectual.

A few centuries ago, when I was in college, I was assigned this novel in a course but never completed it.

The portrait of a parochial, socially and sexually repressed Mexican town \\"on the edge of the storm\\" of the Revolution is searing.  Images from the novel have stayed with me long after plot details have been forgotten, and I remain impressed with Yanez' prose.<br />The novel very deliberately incorporates the stream of consciousness techniques introduced by Joyce, and may be offputting to people who have little pacience with this narrative structure.  On the other hand, the structure works well in providing snapshots of the tensions, needs, resentments, and pain of various villagers in isolated rural Jalisco.  This is a work that is generally overlooked by people who have the Latin American literature bug.  It shouldn't be, as it is one of the best novels from the region that I have read.	2002-09-13

There were two books on the Seven Sister Colleges that came out in the 1970s, &quot;Peculiar Institutions&quot; and &quot;I'm Radcliffe, Fly me!&quot;.  Of the two, &quot;I'm Radcliffe&quot; is the more scholarly and ultimately the more informative book.  Baker approaches her topic with the perspective of an early 70s feminist and criticizes the Sister Colleges for excessive passivity and gentility, attributes that in some ways betrayed the feminist impulses that gave birth to the schools in the first place.  The histories of each school's---Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Mt. Holyoke, Radcliffe, Smith, Vassar, and Wellesley-- founding and early struggles are presented and analyzed, and Baker presents her case that the energy and dynamism of the schools' early years was superceded by a desire to educate but not &quot;rock any boats&quot;  politically or socially. The book is a bit didactic, however, and in some ways Baker may overplay her hand.<br />&quot;Peculiar Institutions&quot; is an interesting companion piece.  It is more anecdotal, more gossipy, more fun.  Yet it also offers intelligent analysis of the Sister schools and the ambivalence that many educated women might have toward the colleges.	2002-02-22

The subsequent chapters are full of random observations and anecdotes that do not cohere to any particular perspective or point.  Certain colleges get decidedly more coverage than others.  As the subtitle suggests, the book is more gossipy than academic.  But even a gossipy book ought to have *some* structure and some point.

With ample photos and text this book faithfully records the development of  Radcliffe from an abstraction to a full fledged institution.  It also  captures the beginnings of the College's dismantling in the 1970s.

The material here might have worked better as a novel, a la Mary McCarthy's The Group (1930s Vassar Grads) or Alice Adam's Superior Women (1950s Radcliffe Grads). Surely there is room for a coming of age story about bright, privileged women of the 1960s generation. The Brearley class of 1968 could have been the focus of such a work, and through narrative license the author could have provided more insight as to what motivated and in some cases tormented the individuals. <br />Instead, this non-fictional work presents girls/women whose personal demons are described through veiled references and through class and historical cliches. The ellipsis may be necessary to protect the women's privacy, but in practice it leaves many of the individuals looking like ciphers on to whom the author projects her pocket psychological interpretations. This projection pattern is particularly disconcerting when the author discusses the girls in elementary and high school; she provides too many pithy insights that can only be derived from (possibly romanticized) memory and not from contemporaneous observation. Why not protect the women by writing fiction, and then using the psychobabble to enrich fictitious characters based on actual acquaintances? At present, some of the portraits lack credibility.<br />Furthermore, the pat historical name and place dropping also hinder the work, as the women's personal struggles seem reduced to easy references to external political developments and pop culture. With overwrought prose the author states repeatedly that her classmates were caught between two Americas, the conformist old order and the tumultuous late 60s. More direct quotes from her classmates and less of the author's florid description of context would better illuminate this conflict. Instead readers are left with cardboard characters and jejune, melodramatic generational angst. The Brearley girls deserve better.	2000-03-17

I am a University School alumnus and attended the school when many of the people described in this book (including Richard Hawley) were there.  Ruhlman has definitely caputured the ethos of the place.  I question,  though, whether the portrait makes a compelling case for boys' schools.  In  reading the book, I was reminded of undercurrents of intolerance and  &quot;group thinking&quot; that may be part of all adolescents but which  seem particularly pronounced when boys are amongst themselves.  The book  also reminded me of how a provincial, almost smug muscular Episcopalianism  is the school's unofficial culture  (the school is theoretically  non-sectarian). While these negatives came out, there was nothing presented  that suggested anything positive about an all-male environment. We are  given a case study with little analysis of the importance of the all male  culture. As a result, one sees the merits of prep-school, i.e. resources,  small classes and attentive faculty, but is left with no sense of why being  all male is relevant.

The gay community often praises this book for its treatment of a man coming to terms with himself and his sexuality.  Yet in writing this work, Baldwin deliberately ignored one aspect of himself---blackness.  The  protagonist here is free to espouse his sexuality, but this freedom stems  in part from the fact that he is white and does not suffer the burdens that  being black *and* gay would create for him.  Baldwin's protagonist can roam  around Europe with his educated and affluent friends, and he doesn't suffer  the condemnation for betraying his race that many black gays face from the  black community.  He doesn't face rejection from families versed in  intolerant Southern Baptist traditions.  He doesn't face the racism within  the overwhelmingly white gay community that often leaves black gays out as  undesireables.  In writing a book that gets praised by the (white) gay  world, Baldwin chose to ignore the very different pains that confront black  gays.  In a work thatis purportedly about freedom to be oneself, Baldwin's  wilfull ommission of the race issue is dishonest.	1999-08-03

I grew up in the environment that Graham describes.  However, I am not impressed with the book.  The author  has  great material for a study and botches his effort by offering little analysis.  He drops names and places,  letting us know that he knows this world, but he does not offer much  critical insight.  He confuses time periods, talking about the  Palmer  Institute, or Camp Atwater or the importance of certain historically black  colleges (Spelman, Howard), without volunteering key facts, such as that  Palmer doesn't even exist any more.  He doesn't touch on or analyze the  tensions between Northern and Southern black elites.  Ultimately, the book  reads like a show and tell exhibit for white people and blacks who are not  part of this world.  It doesn't tell insiders anything they don't already  know, and it doesn't offer the world at large any coherent ideas other than  &quot;See, these people exist.&quot;  This simple notion does not sustain  a whole book.	1999-06-16

Levy rightly criticizes Exeter for a degree of insularity and smugness that the school ought to examine.  (Yet other studies, e.g Preparing for Power,  suggest that this is a flaw of all boarding schools.)  He is also  on fair ground when he underscores a rigid culture amongst the faculty or a   gap between rhetoric and practice with regard to the school's outreach to  disadvantaged minority populations. However, this case study is seriously  flawed by Levy's use of Exeter as a &quot;straw man&quot;  set up for  attack, often with specious arguments.  His suggestion that many students  routinely pull the wool over faculty members' eyes with regard to class  preparation or intellectual honesty is completely off the mark and suggests  wishful thinking on his part and on that of the few students that he chose  to highlight.  In another instance, he insinuates that Exeter's aversion to  hirring PhDs leads to an undereducated faculty that is removed from current  developments in their field.  Yet an &quot;aversion&quot;  (which may make  sense for a high school as opposed to a college) is not an absolute rule,  and he ignores the rather high percentage of Exeter faculty who do indeed  have doctorates---for whatever that is worth.  Indeed, the fact that so  many people with PhDs are willing to teach at Exeter or other boarding  schools but not necessarily other American high schools speaks to a  perception of excellence at these schools that Levy does not address.  He  also makes comparisons between prep schools when it suits his purposes and  fails to do so in situations that would undermine his arguments  (e.g. He  compares Exeter unfavorably to Andover with regard to the number of  adjunct--and thus not cloistered--- faculty the two institutions employ.   But in another instance, he rightfully critiques some Exeter faculty  members' discomfort with growing numbers of Asian/Asian American students,  but fails to acknowlege this racism at other major institutions (secondary  and postsecondary) or the positive reality that in comparison to most peer  schools Exeter has a much greater percentage of Asian and Asian American  students. His discussion of the drug culture is comically hyperbolic.   He  relies on extreme and at times lurid examples in order to make a point, but  fails to acknowledge that his examples are not representative of culture at  Exeter or any other boarding school. (He cites the Eddie Perry story, but  does not acknowlege the many other students who do not suffer as Perry did  but who in fact have thrived.  He also makes simplistic claims about  black-white relations without acknowleging that not all Exeter blacks are  from indigent urban backgrounds;  indeed,   some of Exeter's black students  are from highly afluent families and thus give different (not necessarily  untroubled) nuances to race relations. Ultimately, the case study  demonstrates a cursory familiarity with Exeter, Exeter students,  or other  American boarding schools.  (At the time of printing the book was  embarassingly out of date in its discussion of science education or  Exeter's endowment. Given that the endowment now hovers around $300  million, and given the infusion of new pedagogies and facilities in the  sciences, that discussion is even more painfully dated.)) Levy targets  &quot;arrogance&quot;, but &quot;excellence&quot; is barely acknowleged or  explored. Having conducted many educational case studies, I was dismayed to  see his work.	1999-06-11
