This is one of those books. <br /> <br />The author takes a very exciting, almost thriller-story style, to the exploration of possibilities about the location of the Ark of the Covenant.  He leaves few stones unturned, and ha a nice balance where he does not get caught up too much in wild, un-provable conjectures.  He follows the facts, interviews the experts, and is a refreshing breath of fresh air on the subject. <br /> <br />He is very careful to separate myth and legend from fact.  Yet he does this in a way that if someone like Michael Creighton (author of Jurassic Park) wrote this book.  It is a real page turner, and you might forget that this is a scholarly treatise.  It is similar in style to other books he has written such as \\"The Stones Cry Out\\" (which I also highly recommend). <br /> <br />Dr. Price also provides a wealth of information from Jewish writings that prove quite useful.  For example, he researches the Talmud and the apocryphal writings for clues.  He is careful not to exalt these documents above the Scripture itself, but uses them to see how the idea of the location of the Ark and its function has developed over history.  This is a unique strength of the book, and I would like to see more Christian authors make use of these Jewish writings such as the Talmud. <br /> <br />In addition, Dr. Price also gives serious academic rebuttals to popular theories about the location of the Ark (such as the Ethiopia conjecture) or the careless claims of those who claim to have seen the Ark (such as the late Ron Wyatt).  Dr. Price offers sound Biblical evidence as to why these theories are improbable, and backs it up with detailed historical facts. <br /> <br />In all I think you will find this to be a very readable and pleasant romp through the history of a topic very important to Christians and Jews alike.Messianic believers in particular might find this very interesting because of the use of Talmudic sources.  And Dr. Price is also a refreshing breath of fresh air in that he does not support \\"Replacement Theology\\", which is a theory that somehow the Church ahs replaced Israel.  This theory has sometimes led to wild conjectures about the ark, which can be shown Biblically to be a strained interpretation at best.  But in general anyone who has asked the question, from a religious or historical perspective, \\"What happened to the Ark of the Covenant,\\" will not be disappointed. <br />	2005-10-02

The primer breaks down the Aleph-Bet (alphabet), presents stories, and also conversations.  The book stresses the Sephardic pronunciation used in Israel, and even has an introduction to script.  The final section of the book is very helpful, with a listing of the vowels (including the dangerous diphthongs), some Bible verses, and even songs to help you read and speak the language.    We are using this book in a college class, and I will be using this book to teach a beginning Hebrew Conversation class.  Note that is not Biblical Hebrew (for that, see \\"The First Hebrew Primer\\"), but the emphasis is on conversation and reading.  You won't find detailed discussions of fine points in the language here, such as the use of a patach versus of a kamats, because these are technical issues that really don't affect comprehension of the language as it is currently spoken and written.    Some reviewers have complained that the book is not useful for individual study.  It is not hard to see why at first glance.  However, these reviewers were probably unaware that there is a tape set that can be purchased with the book (although I had to look around to find it; some Messianic sites have the tapes, such as HaKesher).  In the text the authors have a series of sounds using combinations of letters (some are actually words) to stress certain sounds.  In the tape, one of the authors reads the sounds, and also reads the stories and dialogues.  Without the tape, yes it would be difficult to use this book on your own.  With the tape, the task is much easier.  And the book is very good for a class setting.  it is easy to follow, and not a complicated as other texts (it is a PRIMER after all).    And I don't know the authors either ...    So for a classroom book Id give it something like 4 or 5 stars.  But for an individual who uses the tapes, something like a 4 so for this reason Illgo with 4 stars.	2005-10-02

Many other authors have of course done this, but Doukhan has a nice summary here.  Especially relevant is a debunking of the concept that grace was \\"invented\\" by Christianity. Even a casual reading if the Torah shows this was a concept long instilled within the Jewish Scriptures. <br /> <br />I was happy to see that Doukhan does a good job to explain how both Jews and Christians have faulted each other.  He explains, in more ways than I have seen, how the original Jewish believers eventually moved away from their Jewish roots and how this influenced Jewish-Christian relations.  And such a book would not be complete without the customary discussion of replacement theology and the Christian rejection of the Jewish Scriptures.  I think even those who have studied these topics will find some new insights here. <br /> <br />But the book is not without problems.  The author seems to ignore critical evidence to support his opinion sometimes.  For example, he states that Yeshua was well received in the synagogue, citing Luke 4.  But he forgets to mention, that in the very next verse, that those who heard him in the synagogue rushed to throw him out shortly thereafter.  He downplays the significance of the Jewish revolts and the strains this placed on Jewish-Christian relations.  Too often he generalizes that \\"a majority\\" of Jews followed Yeshua ... although many Christian commentators forget that some Jews (and even Rabbi's) did follow the Messiah.  His assertion that violence against the original Jewish believers (i.e., Acts) was \\"not common\\" is unconvincing.  There is not a clear understanding of Acts 15.  And he never does explain what he mans that Jews and Christians are \\"two voices for the same God.\\" <br /> <br />In summary, this book does a good job of setting the record straight about a history of conflict between Christianity and Judaism (Rabbinic).  I applaud the author for offering some fresh, thought-provoking perspectives on the topic.  Doukhan does a great job to present little-known facts that tent to get downplayed, both in the Church and in the Synagogue.  But sometimes the author swings too far in his attempts to balance the scales and marches into error.  Still, the book has great use if one is careful. As a leader in a Messianic Congregation, I do recommend the book.	2005-09-17

Todd Duncan has been there and offers some help as to how to stop the bleeding.  This book was recommended to me by a Pastor who put the points of this book to good use in his own life with very positive results.    This book isn't really a strict time management text as the title suggests.  As the author points out, there are many books for this.  Rather, Time Traps tells you how to be more efficient by freeing up time to do what you do best (in this case, making sales).  So rather than be a slave to email or the phone, the author offers practical suggestions as to limit tasks that are not really that important to the bottom line.  For example, if you have necessary paperwork, find someone else to do it by hiring an assistant or seeing what resources your company has to offer.  Don't spend your time filling out paperwork, spend the time doing what really matters, the task for which you were hired.  As a research faculty member, who seems to have to spend more time doing academic busywork than actual science sometimes, the themes of this book ring frighteningly true to me.    Although the book is marketed towards salespeople, there are important efficiency improvement techniques that can be learned by people of all professions.  The book quotes stats that the majority of salespeople spend 43% of their time managing problems and administrative tasks (it could be worse in academia!).  There is a discussion on how salespeople say yes too often ... the same applies to researchers who sometimes take on too many projects and thus devote to little time to actually doing the projects well.    Some of the items here aren't immediately applicable to other professions.  For example, as a research faculty member I have a responsibility to train students, which is a inefficient but rewarding task.  It is not something that can be completely delegated, although after reading this book I see how what I am doing can be improved.  And research is a highly non-linear process.  In other fields the concepts taught here might be more exactly on the money, so I would definitely invest time to read the book.  But the idea that we define ourselves by our work is right on for all professions; how many times do we think that 80 hour work weeks sound impressive ... only to see the effects this has on marriages, health, and children.  This book will help in at least some ways to keep that output but require less hours to do it.    The book has a slight Christian theme, but the author has a lot of neutral \\"live life to the full\\" concepts that should not be too offensive to non-Christians.  The book is a quick read, and easily accessible with many modern-day references.  In all I think you will find a lot of uplifting and helpful information here that just might improve your life.	2005-08-28

I got this book thinking there wasn't much I'd learn, but I was quite mistaken. <br /> <br />As most who cherish Biblical values know, there is something deeply wrong in our society.  Only, as the author describes it in the context of \\"The Matrix\\", you didn't know what it was.  David Kupelian tells you what that \\"what\\" is. <br /> <br />As I started to read the book, I was frightened.  Frightened to see how the issues of \\"gay rights\\" became such a hotbed topic.  According to the author, this wasn't about rights, but it was the calculated subversion of culture.  When you read about the deliberate and downright misleading campaigns designed to make us accept homosexuality, you start to get nervous.  Just how much of this campaign have we swallowed? <br /> <br />As I read more, and the topics grew into the myth of Church-State separation, the assault on marriage, and the promotion of planned child murder (abortion), I became very angry.  Not at the fact that these things exist, because I knew of these things already.  But it was how these concepts were \\"sold\\" to us that really fumed me.  How due to calculated ad campaigns, abortion stopped being an issue about murder, and became an issue of choice.  Why marriage became less of a contract of love and more about women's \\"liberation.\\"  And you will be shocked at how much of the \\"facts\\" that have fueled our obsessions with sex in this country was based upon fraudulent (and even criminal) research.  The chapter on Kinsey and the selling of sex in America is a true eye opener, and worth the price of the book by itself. <br /> <br />The book is a quick read, but it sort of lacks a certain scholarly element I was seeking.  The book is not unscholarly, but it could use more in some places.  There are so many facts etc that each chapter could be an entire book itself.  Virtually impossible would be the task to try and keep up with each factthe author presents.  But on the topics of which I have a fair amount of knowledge, such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, abortion, marketing teen sexuality, and education, I found the author to be very insightful and accurate.  Some of the topics in this book are future considerations for discussion in our Congregation's youth group.  The author uses the last chapter as an appeal in the spirit of Francis Schaeffer for Christians to \\"stop the insanity.\\"  It is a plea we ignore at the peril of our entire culture. <br />	2005-08-24

This could be one of the most important books of the last decade that will help you understand the times.  The authors, two brothers who were raised Muslim and became Christian, are now professors at Christian schools.  Their backgrounds make them uniquely qualified to address questions such as what does Islam teach, and how does this relate to Christianity.  They have produced a very readable, informative, and respectful survey of many of the most important aspects of the Islamic faith system.  You don't want to miss reading this work. <br /> <br />I was especially happy to see that the book is not just a long lament about how bad Muslims are, or how foul Muhammad is and so on.  The authors present the teachings of Islam in the best way possible; from the Qur'an and the Hadith themselves.  Some Christian apologists often quote secondary sources, and haven't really studied the primary ones themselves.  This leaves them open to criticism in debates, and often misinterpretations.   <br /> <br />I was also especially happy to see the authors evaluate the teachings of Islam against a conservative and evangelical perspective of the Scripture.  They compared very well, for example, the Biblical accounts of the birth of the Messiah (Jesus) and the Akidah (sacrifice of Isaac) with the accounts of the Qur'an.  The ethics of the Qur'am and the Hadith are also sharply contrasted with the teachings of the Bible.  I found many things useful, but in particular the list of surahs from Mecca and Medina (there is a huge difference between them) was priceless. <br /> <br />The authors also did a very good job of dispelling many myths.  Think that Islam is peaceful at its core (at least as taught by the Qur'an and Hadith)?  Think that Islam worships the same God as the Christians?  Think that Islam expresses tolerance or equality for women?  Think Jihad is only \\"allegorical\\" or that is has ceased?  The authors show why these myths are untrue, using Muslim primary sources. <br /> <br />The Caner brothers do an excellent job of explaining the Muslim mind because, quite frankly, they were Muslims.  They aren't passing along things they heard on the radio.  There is also a nice summary chapter that serves to make bridges towards Muslims by understanding things that are culturally offensive in Muslim circles. <br /> <br />Probably the only thing the book is really missing is a discussion of the nation of Israel and the promises God made to them in terms of the land (i.e., the Abrahamic Covenant).  The authors recommend that in conversation with Muslims, one should likely dance around this topic.  But if true dialogue is to be made with the Muslim world, one must come to grips with the biblical promises God made to Israel.  We should approach this topic with love and respect, but in the same way we cannot skip who is Jesus, neither can we skip the promises God made to Israel. <br /> <br />Finally, I liked this book because the authors are respectful.  All too often it is easier to just mock the Muslim beliefs.  The authors have a deep concern that Muslims come to faith, similar in Spirit to Paul lamenting that his countrymen be saved.  These authors give a lot of information so that you might understand the Muslim mind.  As a leader of a Messianic congregation, which is very concerned with Islam and its relationship with Israel, I highly recommend this book.  You may not find a better one on the topic. <br />	2005-08-08

What I found was a very practical, Biblically-centered, and informative approach on how both men and women can tackle the immense problem of lust.  I quickly found myself realizing that this book was not only good enough for our youth group, but for me, and even for our entire congregation.  This will definitely be a future topic in our ministry, both to the teens and to the adults. <br /> <br />I like this book.  Harris is not afraid to say what needs to be said.  You know that he is like the \\"rest of us\\" because as you read the book, you find yourself thinking .. yes I've thought that before ... oh my I did that too ... good grief, is he reading my mind? <br /> <br />Mr. Harris offers some very simple ideas (but not necessarily easy ones) for combating lust in our lives.  For example, he asks the reader to take stock as to when and where lust strikes so that we can understand how the problem occurs and how to take steps to fight it.  He uses the Bible to show not only the dangers of lust, but also to show solutions to the problem.  The book does not offer a \\"formula\\" that will help you win the fight.  But Mr. Harris expertly points out just how society is permeated with lustful images and innuendos.  And like it or not, these things influence and de-sensitize us to the real problems of lust. <br /> <br />The book is a very light read; you could put this one away in one sitting.  But you might just find yourself going through it many times because there is a lot of practical advice and strategy to be learned.  The book is highly recommended for both men and women, married or single alike.  It could just be one of the most important books you will read for a long time. <br />	2005-08-07

The book is meant for new faculty, but anyone interested in learning practical lab management issues is encouraged to read this book.  There is something useful in this book for both green rookies and experienced veterans.  <br /> <br />There is nothing in the book that is earth-scattering information; most of it is common sense.  But nowhere else have I seen such a variety of practical information on lab management compressed into one book.  There are even a variety of quotes from other professors about specific situations that are quite enlightening. <br /> <br />The author includes many topics such as conflict resolution, time and management, recruitment skills, and general management skills.  Of course none of these topics are covered in dramatic detail (and likely don't need to be) but each one is broken down into very manageable, independent sections.  I found myself applying immediately the things I had learned, realizing ways I can supervise my students better than I had before. <br /> <br />The text is also geared more towards academic life sciences, but even as a physicist I found this book invaluable.  Highly recommended to anyone working in a lab, and in particular to anyone charged with management responsibilities in a laboratory setting.  The author is to be congratulated! <br /> <br />	2005-08-03

The main premise of the position, as presented by the author, is that a person's view of self is essentially the most important thing imaginable.  People need to have good feelings about themselves. If anything makes people \\"feel bad,\\" such as being told they are a sinner by the Bible, then the Bible needs to change (or our understanding of the Bible). <br /> <br />Although the books I dated in the mid-80's, the problem is still with us more than ever, thus I suppose the importance of the topic stressed by the author was quite appropriate.  The initial chapter of the book is a hodge-podge survey of popular psychology literature in the 80's, showing clearly the dangerous pattern of how self became the most important word. <br /> <br />I was especially happy to see the author resort to the Scriptures for answers about how to find their value to the Lord.  He does cite many verses, and points out a lot of useful insights.  But the book does lack a little Scriptural rigor.  It is really meant more as an apologetic against the self-esteem movement, and it is not really designed to teach from the Scriptures the really view of self one should derive from the scriptures.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is to see how some Christians have twisted the Scriptures to make it fit to secular man-centered theories.  Some of these \\"Christian\\" authors have a very poor command of the Scriptures, and Adams should be commended for calling out their errors.  This section of the book is a good reminder of the need for sound exegetical principles, and how almost anything can be made to sound palatable if you twist it enough. <br /> <br />This is a quick read and has some helpful points, so for that reason and the treatment of Scripture-twisting I'd recommend it.  But I'm still going to search for other books on the topic. <br />	2005-07-31

There are no overly academic descriptions here; Dr. Longman successfully promotes sound exegetical ideas into very simple-sounding English.  But don't let the simplicity fool you; there is a lot of important information here that will save you a lot of pain in the future if you heed the author's advice.  If you are reading this I'm assuming you have an interest in studying the book of Proverbs, so I won't try to convince you of the value of Proverbs. <br /> <br />Dr. Longman gives the reader plenty of background information in three informative sections.  The first section deals with background on the nature of the proverb; what it is and what it is not.  Knowing the historical setting is stressed.  Exegetical principles are established by looking for patterns such as parallelism, and numerical parallelism, imagery and others.  The second section deals with the context of wisdom in the Bible; how the comments in Proverbs relate to other Bible books such as Job and Ecclesiastes.  On this topic, Tremper Longman may be one of the best because he has written extensively on the Hebrew wisdom literature, and his Biblical and historical insights are quite valuable.  The final section is a list of a few special studies in proverbs, such as the topic of money and marriage.  Although not exhaustive, they are insightful and help the reader to see how to put the ideas of the previous sections into practice. <br /> <br />The author deals with practical issues such as \\"Are proverbs always true?\\"  This chapter is worth the price of the book, because in my experience Christians tend to take proverbs as always true when in fact they are reflections on life that are generally true.  Why some proverbs seem to contradict each other is also discussed very well.  Dr. Longman treats with integrity and thoughtfulness the topic of is Jesus/Yeshua referred to as the \\"wisdom\\" in Proverbs 8.  And the comparison of proverbs to other forms of ancient literature was a real treat. <br /> <br />In short, this is a great first-stop shopping book that I recommend prior to a study of Proverbs.  The book is not overly Jewish, but you will gain some insight into ancient Jewish culture from this study of wisdom literature.  Advanced scholarly types might not find the book as useful, but Longman's explanations are pretty thoughtful and would be very useful for teaching purposes.  I think regardless of training, you will still find some helpful insights.  The book could also be the topic of a Bible study, since there are a series of group-discussion questions at the end of each chapter.  There are also lots of suggestions for further reading, and a list of useful commentaries.  A delightful book overall that will enhance your walk with God! <br />	2005-07-31

Overall it is a very concise treatment of a lot of important topics in the Messianic movement. <br /> <br />The theology section is fantastic.  For example, Walter Kaiser (who has written extensively on the Tanach, or \\"Old Testament\\") contributed a fantastic survey of the Messianic prophecies.  This is required reading for all who take the Bible seriously, weather Christian, Jew, or Messianic Jew.  John Fisher's section on the covenant aspect of the Scripture is also very informative, especially for those new to Messianic Jewish thinking.  Schiffman does as nice job discussing the nature of God, Father Son and Spirit, into a Jewish context (but is very brief ... a shame!). <br /> <br />The section about Israel is also very good.  Elliot Klayman's brief survey of the Israeli law of return is very relevant.  David Stern, who has also written extensively on Messianic Issues, also contributes two very nice articles on how the land and in particular Jerusalem is vital to the promised of God.  These essays, and in particular the one on Jerusalem, should be required reading for Christians who don not understand \\"the fascination\\" with the land of Israel.   <br /> <br />The practical issues section was also very helpful, but there were a few warning flags.  I found the essay by Patrice Fisher on the assimilation of Jews in America to be very helpful, especially in terms of outreach to the Jewish community.  But another article by Patrice is very weak, by saying some Gentiles \\"may wish to formally convert to Judaism.\\"  This is not only a clear violation of Scripture, but will further enrage the Jewish community against Messianic Jews with what may turn out to be deception.  Patrice also walks a fine line saying that Gentiles can be members of Messianic fellowships provided they \\"maintain Torah practices like biblical God-fearing gentiles.\\"  Not enough discussion is really devoted to what that means because for example, not all Messianic congregations keep kosher, and some who claim to really don't.  In addition, John Fischer has a good essay about rabbinic tradition.  I loved his article in the sense he explains that not everything the Rabbis said was bad, a point many Christians fail to realize.  But Fischer dramatically oversimplifies the problem, because the Talmud for example has many things in it that Yeshua (Jesus) condemned and Fischer magically omits these issues from his essay.  The Talmud is what it is; it is like a commentary and in commentary some are bad and some are good. <br /> <br />Overall this is a very insightful book that Messianic Jews will find helpful in their walk with God.  There is a lot of Scripture in it and as such it might be useful for Christians to understand the Messianic position, for example to deal with issues of \\"Replacement Theology.\\"  When appropriate, the authors point out mistakes in Christianity without mocking their Christian brothers; I found this tone very mature and loving.  I would give it 5 stars but those odd comments in Patrice Fisher's essays make me consider it a 4.5 stars or so book.  <br />	2005-07-10

Professor Kaiser outlines each type of literature found in the Tanach.  He gives valuable insights into how to read and teach, for example, poetry, as opposed to historical narrative.  I was amazed at how application-oriented the book is the author is not interested in weighting you down with hermeneutical jargon.  Yet he manages to convey important hermeneutical principles and even provides examples. <br /> <br />I was also very happy to see a defense if you will of why the Tanach is important for Christians.  Too often Churches ignore the incredible importance of the Tanach; it is the basis of the New Testament.  While most do not go to the level of the heretic of Marcion, as Christians we rob ourselves of our rich Biblical history by not taking the time to dig deep into the origins of our faith. <br /> <br />If you have ever felt intimidated about the Tanach, and thought it was too complicated or antiquated to read and understand and apply to your life, I encourage you to read this book.  Professor Kaiser has an uncanny ability to explain how to handle the books of the Tanach.  The text is not exhaustive, but gives some very helpful principles that is sure to strengthen your faith because you will be able to learn more from the Tanach.  I would also strongly suggest that Messianic believers take a serious look at this book; there is a lot of information in here too. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled into thinking this work should be enjoyed only by teachers/preachers.  Anyone who has a desire to better understand the Bible will find this a very helpful book.  There are sections that discuss how to expound upon the Scriptures, but the majority of the book is still applicable. <br />	2005-07-03

By Morris's stratification, miracles can be divided into two main categories: those that break the laws of nature and those that do not.  By the laws of nature, the author refers to the first two laws of thermodynamics, which is about as secure of a natural law as you can get.  Generally, laws that create (such as the creation) are in the first class of miracles whereas the fall of Jericho (which could have been from a timely earthquake) might be considered a miracle in the second class. <br /> <br />There are a lot of nuggets in here.  For example, the section on false miracles was actually quite good, and a solid reminder to the believer that not all seemingly miraculous things are in reality performed by God.  For those not familiar with thermodynamics, you will get a refresher course here in layman's terms.  It was also somewhat interesting to hear about some testimonies that are laced throughout the book. <br /> <br />But this was not a book to be anecdotal: I was expecting some hard-core science and philosophy and it just never materialized.  Coming from a man of the stature of Henry Morris I expected a lot more.  Don't get me wrong: the categorization of miracles in terms of the laws of thermodynamics was useful, but it wasn't enough. <br /> <br />The book is pretty simple to read and does have Scriptural support.  The author seems to constantly repeat himself, so the book in content is actually quite a bit shorter than the length suggests.  I was also disappointed in that the recommended reading list is essentially from books in the 1950's; surely something more modern must exist?  His hermeneutical description of the gifts of the Spirit is tenuous at best. <br /> <br />This is an OK book to thumb through, but it is not the sort of scholarship you might expect or desire from Henry Morris.  There is enough to keep some marginal interest, but Ill keep looking for a better text on the miracles of the Bible. <br />	2005-05-07

The conversations are classified into categories such as those whose faith Messiah praised, those who Messiah healed, and those who opposed Messiah.  Each section gives appropriate Scripture references, flowing narrative, and short applications.  The book is pretty light reading, with each conversation not more than a few pages.<br /><br />The conversations of the Messiah make for an interesting study but this book falls a bit short, in my opinion.  The author gives the origins of each of the important names in the conversations, something which I found helpful.  But some of the comments in the application section left me wondering, such as \\"Yeshua (Jesus) continues to heal through medicine etc.\\" Now does he man that God only or sometimes heals through modern medicine?  I couldn't tell.  In some ways, the application section should have been built up more.<br /><br />Personally I found the book to be somewhat useful as a devotional.  The outline of the book (i.e. looking at all of the people Messiah healed, etc) makes for a useful jumping point in a Bible study, but I think the Bible itself would be a better choice than the conversation summaries.<br /><br />The analysis of the conversations is often grossly oversimplified.  It was nice for the author to try to make the conversations \\"more real\\" by adding some comments to fill in the text.  But many of the added comments are many times either not obvious or gross assumptions.  I frequently found myself asking \\"now why does he think that?\\"  It detracted me from the flow of the book.<br /><br />Thus if you are new to the gospel, and are seeking a devotional-style look at the conversations of the Messiah, this is a good book and I would give it 4 stars.  But for someone who has studied the gospels, this book won't add much and I would give it 3 stars.	2005-04-23

In short, the authors clearly demonstrate that Harold Camping is a false prophet.  Camping is a date-setter for the end of the world (who was clearly wrong!), and with his \\"leave the churches\\" diatribe, Camping has placed his prophetic utterances above the written Word of God.  This is a shame because he appears to teach the Gospel on his website. <br /> <br />The authors make short work of Camping's ridiculous claims.  In fact, Camping's claims are so outrageous that isn't very hard to do!  But Duncan and Talbot do it with both logic and Scripture.  Their arguments are sound, easy to follow, and don't resort to name calling.  There are even some nice lessons about the function of the church that could be useful for a Bible study. <br /> <br />The book is obviously not for everyone since it is focused upon a singular topic.  I found the book researching the Family Radio School of the Bible, which has an outreach into prisons. <br /> <br />The only complaint I have with the book is what I perceive to be replacement theology; somehow the church has replaced Israel.  The authors are very knowledgeable but don't seem to have a strong foundation in the Jewish roots of Christianity.  Still the book has uses because it provides some good teaching on the Church and a good (overall) response to a heretical teaching. <br />	2005-04-23

By historical, I mean a survey of the evidence of the church father's writings.  While these works themselves are not inspired, they do paint a pretty consistent picture about the order of the Gospels according to Black.  The first chapter is a survey of sorts, where little evidence is given.  The next sections defend why he claims the books were written in the order he selects.  The final chapter is a massive summary of sorts, proposing almost a CSI-style assembly of the puzzle via historical events. <br /> <br />What I found most interesting is the simplicity of the arguments.  I for one do not believe the textual arguments of the so-called Markian Priority position (ie Mark came first), because all of the arguments I see are reversible and don't prove anything.  The order he presents makes perfect sense in light of the historical arguments he proposes.  Of course we may never know the exact order, but Professor Black makes a pretty good case in a short amount of space.  He doesn't really talk about textual criticism, so for that information I would look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Why Four Gospels presents an alternative view to the main opinion of scholars, and comes with a massive bibliography.  The book will give you confidence that we have all of the Gospels God intended for us to have.  And he tells a great story about how the gospels came together in the Canon and gives us a great book for spring-boarding into the synoptic problem. <br />	2005-03-21

If you are new to Messianic studies or to the Jewish background to the Brit Chadashah (New Testament) this is a good book with which to start.  Knowledge of Hebrew is not required. <br /> <br />The book takes you on a journey through some of the conflicts between Christianity and Judaism by analyzing the Jewish roots of Christianity.  For example, there is a detailed analysis about the Pharisees that most Christians likely have not studied.  Most Christians assume a Pharisee is the epitome of hypocrisy; some were but not all, as we learn from the Scripture.  Dr. Moseley also uses Josephus and Talmudic sources to show what the Pharisees believed and gives a brief outline about how believers in Yeshua began their dangerous departure from their Jewish roots. <br /> <br />There is also a nice description about 10 hard to understand comments of Yeshua that make a lot of sense in light of His Jewish roots.  Personally, I found Dr. Moseley's descriptions better than those of Bivin (Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus).  It is a shame he only discusses ten of these. <br /> <br />The most serious flaw in the book is that the author divides up the Torah into parts, and reasons that some Laws are \\"active\\" and the others are fulfilled (such as those related to the temple).  Such a division is helpful, but unscriptural.  He also makes some serious assumptions about the adherence beyond the Noachide Laws; more detail (instead of a reference) would have been helpful..  Dr. Moseley's discussion about Yeshua's and Paul's reaction to the Law, however, are quite good. <br /> <br />What I found especially helpful is the analysis of the Scripture in light of other Jewish sources.  Although the Talmud is not inspired, it is helpful for understanding some of what people believed when Yeshua was on the Earth.  The chapters are brief, digestible, and come with study questions. <br /> <br />In summary this is a good starter book that will enlighten those new to the Jewish roots of Christianity, but it will also give some food for thought to those more experienced <br />	2005-03-07

This is not an exhaustive treatment, but enough to demonstrate the principles.  The author also includes a number of helpful tools, such as a dance step glossary, and few examples of dances. <br /> <br />The book is a pretty light read, and has a respectful and joyful style.  There aren't a lot of references and notes, but when you stop to think about it when was the last time you saw lots of stuffy on this topic?  Hopefully this book will encourage more of that. <br /> <br />Dance worship is a pretty distinctive and integral part of Messianic Jewish Congregations; this is the perspective from which the book was written.  For those who want to get an idea about Messianic dance, and perhaps integrate it inot your congregation, this is a great book.  If you have doubts that dance and worship (Godly) can coexist, this is also an excellent starting point. <br /> <br />In summary this is a delightful book that gives a helpful picture of what congregational dance can be.  May you use dance in your worship of the Lord! <br />	2005-03-06

The book is dated to be sure, and Dickson is certainly \\"old school.\\" <br /> <br />But this was such a thrilling example of what elders in the service of Yeshua should be doing that I couldn't put it down.  The book consists of 13 easy to read chapters that contain many gems of service to the flock of Messiah.  There is no \\"deep theology\\" here, only a leading by example that James himself would make James proud.  I found there were dozens of wonderful ideas about how to encourage God's people.  Im not sure you can read this book and not see how God touched the life of David Dickson. <br /> <br />The text is actually a re-publish of David Dickson's classic work.  The new editors have done a nice job of \\"translating\\" several customs that are not in practice anymore, as well as some Scottish \\"slang.\\"  This is needed because the book is pretty dated (for example, using \\"tokens\\" for communion).  But the editor's real contribution is the study questions at the end of each chapter.  They drip with the fruit of the Spirit.  And they will make you think hard and deep about what it means to be an elder or a leader. <br /> <br />This book is easy to read and seems destined for a perfect application Bible study, a training course for elders, or general knowledge those who are called to leadership in the service of the Messiah.  Highly edifying, the way ministry should be. <br />	2005-03-04

Many Believers in Yeshua (Jesus) will say that the tithe is valid today but ignore the rest of the Torah commandments.  Dr. Martin outlines why this is inconsistent, and ignores the commands of the New Testament. <br /> <br />The author explains some little known Biblical facts and modern misconceptions about the Biblical tithe.  The book is worth the price just for that analysis.  He also does a simple analysis as to how ministry is supported in the New Testament.  As do I, the author subscribes to the New Testament principle of being a cheerful giver of free will offerings under God's direction.  <br /> <br />The book is easy to read and could be read completely in a good quite moment.  The book is critical at times of Christianity, but in some cases his scorn is warranted. <br /> <br />One word of earning; Ernest Martin is an interesting historian but he is not a Trinitarian.  At the least he denies that the Holy Spirit is God.  This however does not get into the way of his conclusions. <br /> <br />Unfortunately Amazon doesn't have the book in print as of this writing.  But you can get this book at the Associates for Scriptural Knowledge website (ASK). <br />	2005-02-15

Dr. Morey outlines briefly many questions that young adults should ask about their understanding of their personality/character, faith, and world view.  It is very important to have thought about this BEFORE college because once you get there a battle will have started for your minds and the opposition doesn't always fight fair. <br /> <br />The book in some ways is very simple and very complex in others.  I liked the fact that Dr. Morey asks many practical questions.  For example, how does one determine their self worth?  How do we know we are saved?  Are all religions the same?  Is truth relative?  Although this tiny book cannot possibly cover all of these topics in detail, the collection of such questions is very helpful.  On the other hand there is a long discussion about cults, existentialism and the like.  When I was a teenager I had no idea about these things, so reading them for the first time in a book like this is confusing.  But making sure that a young adult is aware of these things is very critical because students will be exposed to relativism, even if it is never called this. <br /> <br />This might not be the best book for the teenager to read; for this reason I feel reluctant to give 5 stars.  But the topics covered are without question essential for the college-bound young adult.  College has become a battleground for the hearts and minds of young adults.  Reading and discussing this book with your youth-group and/or parents is a great way to make sure that these same young adults are not taken captive by vain philosophy. <br /> <br />Morey has written extensively on the topics of apologetics and practical theology, and serves as a good candidate to write a book such as this.  The book is a quick read for an adult, but could be a little bouncy for young adults.  However, the material in this book should be standard in youth groups!  Young adults would do well to study this book. <br />	2005-02-14

Starting from important historical considerations, such as the methods of writing during the gospel period, the author develops a consistent story of (1) how the New Testament (NT) canon developed, and (2) how the knowledge of Yeshua (or Jesus) grew in gospel times.  I highly recommend this book because of the amazing way the author ties together ALL of the NT books, while keeping a consistent Jewish and historical perspective. <br /> <br />In some ways Prof. Witherington is an ideal candidate to write this text. He has written a many commentaries about important books in the NT; you will find a sampling of his work on these documents (Mark. Acts, Romans, and Revelation, just to name a few).  In addition, Prof. Witherington has also done extensive \\"historical Yeshua\\" research. <br /> <br />The book is divided into two parts.  The first part is a survey of the documents of the NT.  The first chapter, which discusses writing in gospel times, is required reading.  Prof. Witherington then discusses each NT scroll in chronological order.  Generally he has early dates, and does provide reasons for all of them.  Major themes for each scroll are given, as well as intended audience.  The second part of the book builds a picture of major themes in NT stories.  There is a large and useful chapter about how the NT writers and Yeshua used stories and concepts from the Tanach (or Old Testament).  There is a large discussion about Peter and Paul.  The book closes with major discussions about how both non-gospel (ie Paul, Acts) sources describe Yeshua and also how gospel sources describe Yeshua. <br /> <br />The strength of this book is the way Prof. Witherington ties everything together.  Rather than just looking at how one author wrote about the Messiah, we can see how all of them did.  You can really see how the message of the Messiah develops because the documents are discussed in chronological order.  Prof. Witherington does asuperlative job of linking all the documents together.  Additionally, because he is a good historian, Prof. Witherington is well aware of the Jewish context of the Scriptures. <br /> <br />I was especially happy that the author chose to take a high view of Scripture.  By this I mean that whenever a \\"problem\\" seems to manifest, he doesn't chicken out and say the Scripture erred.  Rather, the author simply looks deeper, and resolves several problem passages.  This is a good source of \\"Bible difficulties,\\" although it is hardly encyclopedic. <br /> <br />You might not agree with all of his assertions.  For example, I'm not so certain that Mark was really the first gospel.  And people can argue all day about exact dates.  But you will find that this is a solid conservative, historical, and biblically accurate description of the corpus of literature we call the NT.  It is not a detailed NT introduction such as the excellent work by Cason, Moo, and Morris.  But for a good handle on the historical background of the NT and how it ties into the entire canon, this is one of the best books around.  I highly recommend this work for the beginner as well as the scholar. <br />	2005-02-13

He provides a lot of interesting facts, but offers a conclusion that misses the mark.  His book is pretty light reading, and his writing style easy to follow.  Some of the book is supported by statistics (which are not explained, but references are given), but the bulk of the conclusions are derived from the author's personal experience (which is extensive, but hardly complete).  As a point of reference, I am a Gentile believer in Yeshua (Jesus), I have attended Messianic Congregations since 1999, and I have helped lead one since 2003.<br /><br />Stan Telchin offers a valid Biblical analysis of how some people interpret Messianic Judaism.  By Messianic Judaism, the author seems to refer to anyone who practices Christianity in a Jewish way.  The main critique he discusses, and one with which I agree, is that too many Messianic Jews/Gentiles try so hard to be accepted by mainstream Judaism that they begin to sacrifice the Gospel.  As Telchin points out, some in Messianic Congregations emphasize Talmudic adherence to the Torah, which is something that even Yeshua Himself did not do.  He points out how some groups divide based upon Jewish and Gentile heritage, and this is of course wrong, but just because in his experience some groups do this by no means characterizes the entire movement.  He points out that some believers felt peer pressure to keep a kosher diet, but then again does this type of scenario happen in other groups as well?  Messianic Congregations may not be for everyone, but just because a few people have had problems is no reason to conclude that all of them are unnecessary..<br /><br />Although Mr. Telchin does admit that there may be congregations that do not fit this profile (and yes there are), he seems to throw out the baby with the bathwater, as it were.  What I found disturbing is how quickly Telchin turns his facts into his main thesis, that there is really no need for Messianic Congregations.  One example of how he reaches this conclusion is that issues can be so divisive, lets get rid of them.  I find this to be a very myopic conclusion.  Should we should disband all Baptist and Charismatic Congregations because they cannot agree on Tongues?  Of course not.  He also cites as evidence that very few Jews today are in touch with their ancestral traditions, so why use these traditions to reach them?<br /><br />Telchin cites as a reason to disband Messianic Congregations that only 4% of Jewish people became believers because of Messianic Congregations.  Again by this logic, why not close up all evangelistic outreaches to say the Muslim world because only a few percent convert?  I sense the frustration in Telchin's words, but to close up Messianic Congregations based upon statistics seems to be following business models and not necessarily the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />In all, I think Mr. Telchin provides a very important analysis about some types of Messianic Congregations.  His message, though harsh, was delivered in love, and in this manner I have great respect for his words.  These groups, which over-emphasize Jewishness at the expense of the Gospel, should take note.  But to conclude that Messianic groups are themselves therefore a divisive force is unfair, and un-Biblical.  The book is important to read for some good facts, but be wary of the conclusion.<br /><br />For those who were angered at the conclusions, Telchin does provide a good message that we as the body of Messiah should not seek to be divisive.  To those who have not been a part of Messianic groups, and might not want to based upon this book, rest assured that not all Messianic groups behave this way.  Telchin's analysis represents a kind of \\"worst case scenario\\" that should be avoided at all costs.

Sinai	Books	4	14	14	N	N	Exciting read, low scholarship, high on Bible integrity	This is an exciting tale told from the perspective of \\"hands on\\" explorers who read the Bible as accurate in matters of history.  Written as an easy read, the book is very interesting but weak from a scholarship perspective.  Still, the excitement captured by the authors makes this a good book to read, particularly if you are interested in lands of the Bible. <br /> <br />Mr. Cornuke is a dedicated Christian believer, as evidenced from his writings and the way he uses Scripture to guide his searches.  He has a background in forensics, which makes for an interesting view from which to handle archaeological evidence.  His conclusions are in disagreement with the traditional route of the Exodus, which places the Israelites wandering around in the Sinai Peninsula.  The problem with the traditional assertion is the lack of evidence and common sense.  I give Mr. Cornuke a lot of credit for breaking with the tradition, especially since the tradition is not based upon Biblical information.  <br /> <br />Mr. Cornuke places the crossing of the Red Sea on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula (straits of Tiran), offering as evidence Bible verses and an underwater land bridge.  He attempts to excavate drowned chariots, but claimed that water was too deep.  As for Mt. Sinai, Mr. Cornuke places it in Saudi Arabia.  He offers some photographic evidence, for example, pictures of an altar with c calf inscribed on it.  Of course such evidence by itself is not conclusive.  But his assertions fit the known geography of the land a lot better than the Sinai  Peninsula.  I'm convinced that Mt. Sinai is not in the Sinai Peninsula, and is located likely in Saudi Arabia,  although I disagree with the mountain Mr. Cornuke chose. <br /> <br />The book is written from the perspective of an explorer and is a fast, exciting read.  Although the level of scholarship in this book is a little weak, the book makes up for this somewhat because of the \\"take you there with me\\" mentality of the authors.You really feel as if you are along with them, making the discoveries as you go through the ancient lands.  If you would like a more detailed work that comes to similar conclusions (ie Sinai is located in Arabia), I would recommend the book \\"The Miracles of Exodus\\" by Colin Humphreys.  This book offers a lot more scholarship, and retains the \\"take you there with me\\" mentality. <br />	2005-01-02

Dr. Witherington destroys with relative ease the arguments used by the Da Vinci and similar desparate attempts to perverse Christianity with Gnostic thought. <br /> <br />The book is generally readable, but there are a few technical discussions (such as a detailed history of the theology on the divinity of Jesus).  I was especially impressed with the author's use of the documents in question, the gnostic literature.  He goes to great length to demonstrate why the Bible and history eaily label the Mr. Brown (the author of the Da Vinci Code) as a liar or a careless historian (your choice).  The author even points out how ignorant Mr. Brown is of history since Mr. Brown does not even seem to know the language of the Nag Hammadi books (shame on you Mr. Brown!). <br /> <br />The Gospel Code lists seven lapses in reason displayed by the \\"experts\\" in the Da Vinci Code fable.  Dr. Witherington demonstrates conclusively that the Gnostic ideas involved in literature such as the \\"Gospel of Thomas\\" and the \\"Gospel of Mary\\" and so on are in complete contradiction with the literature found in the New Testament.  He proves convincingly that historically these gnostic documents are dated much later than the New Testament documents, and far less reliable too (ie, copy errors, omissions, etc).  Thus not only are \\"missing\\" these documents unreliable, but they were never considered as part of the cannon because they appeared after the Scriptures were being assembled.  In addition, he refutes the arguments of the Da Vinci code using the documents themselves, and thus his use of logic is justified. <br /> <br />And before you try to label the author as a \\"hater of women,\\" I suggest you read the book to see his view of women in ministry.  The author also has a nice discussion as to why Jesus was not married, and then explains why it would not be a problem even if He were. <br /> <br />Interestingly, the author also shows that these gnostic documents are very anti-Jewish, making it impossible to believe that the early chruch (composed mostly of Jews) would believe them to be inspired texts.  Amazing what a little knowledge of history can do ... <br /> <br />He also recounts the theories of people who feel that the gnostic gospels were \\"unfairly' rejected from the cannon.  But what is amazing is that from their own writings Dr. Witherington reveals the true reason these \\"scholars\\" want to add gnostic thought to the Bible (read the book to find out why!). <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is a very readable, scholarly work that will answer conclusively the false claims of Mr. Browns Da Vinci Code.  To anyone who loves the Scriptures, or who seriously want to know if the claims of the Da Vinci Code are true, I suggest you read this book.	2004-08-08

The end of the book also contains a series of useful charts and tables that were very helpful; chronologies of Israel, outlines of archeological eras, lists of museums, you name it.<br /><br /> I also found that the author did not oversell the facts. That is, he used the evidence wisely and did not try to go beyond the facts to prove his theories. When he speculates it is clearly mentioned. He is academically honest.	2004-07-28
US	52763694	R3IA0BULJFWQEJ	0683306049	385798595	All You Really Need to Know to Interpret Arterial Blood Gases (Includes ABC Quik Course)	Books	5	9	9	N	Y	Very helpful discussion of an important medical topic	If you could only read one book on blood gasses this would have to be the one.<br />This book covers the nitty-gritty about Arterial blood gasses (ABG).  As a PhD who performs biomedical research, I have come across &quot;experts&quot; who resort to physiological babble because they dont know what arterial saturation is really all about.  You will if you read this book.  <br />The book centers around four classic expresssions: (1) partial pressure of co2, (2) pH (3) alveolar gas equation, and (4) o2 content.  From these four expressions, and a little knowledge of clinical medicine, you will understand just about everything you need to know about ABG.  Dont let the equations scare you off; you know them already.<br />The book is simple to read, and has example problems.  The real-world examples/problems really help in applying the knowledge, which I found to be quite useful.  The author does not go into deep biochemical details.  But if you need a good solid introduction to blood chemistry, or have to review how to read an ABG report this is a great book.	2004-07-17

Janie Warner has put together a pretty good intro to web design using dreamweaver.  The book is a bit wordy, but then again all of the Dummies Books are.  Dont let the Dummies title scare you.  This book has a lot of detail and scope; it just takes her a while to get through it.<br />The book is well written in an easy to understand style.  I especially appreciated her advice on compatability; all too often people new to web design get carried away with effects and bells and whistles .. only to find it takes forever to load or the format gets messed up on other computers.  She has a &quot;keep it simple&quot; attitude that I have found very helpful in my own designs.<br />There are many examples from webpages she has done and observed.  I also found that really helpful in deciding how to layout my own sites.  She also has a good discussion of CSS (cascading style sheets), and even covers Flash and Shockwave too.<br />In short the book is not incredibly detailed but it has quite a broad array of information for you to set up a pretty nice web site in very little time.  If you have enough familiarity with computers, you can read through the book easily in a weekend and come out armed with lots of good ideas for web page designs.  By using the advice in her book, I have gotten great reviews on sites I have done.	2004-07-15

This item doe sthe job although it does take a little effort to get the quarters in the slots.  Has space for all 50 states including the D and P series.  And it even has a little history of the US presidents on the insert.<br />This product is nothing to get excited about, but then again what did you want from a folder that holds quarters?  It does fine if all you want is a place to stash your state quarters so that they dont wind up in the laundry machine instead.	2004-07-12

And the scary thing is that the story is true.  This page-turner will grip you from the onset and leave you will a chill down yor spine when you realize the nature of the world of virology.<br />Preston makes the story flow well from beginning to end.

It wont take you long to read this book, and it is written in a comfortable style.<br />Anyone with an interest in viruses, microbiology, public health, or who just want a good reality thriller should read this book.  You will not be disappointed!	2004-07-12

If you think that Bill Cosby's recent speeches have any validity then this is the book for you.  It has statistics that are absolutely frightening.  If you think Bill Cosby's recent speeches are a myth, then this is also the book for you because you have been deceived.  I know many Americans who blame their current problems on whites ... this book explains why that view is nonsense.  <br />The out-of wedlock birthrate of black americans is over 70%,  yet never a word about this from the NAACP or Mr. Jackson.  This book gets a little emotive at times but is backed by many facts and statistics from a man who has been active to live what he preaches.  A quick, informative read.	2004-07-12

Larry Burkett's book shows the clear value of managing your money in your marriage.  He sites many examples from consulting where families were unprepared for financial situations that arose in their lives (for example, purchasing a home based upon on two incomes and then one of them becomes pregnant ...).  Other examples include communication breakdown and unrealistic expenditure patterns.  Most importantly, Mr. Burkett emphasizes the use of a budget in order to avoid these pitfalls and take teh stress out of your marriage.<br />I found the book to be a simple and interesting read.  There are many practical guidelines about establishing a budget.  The percentages in the proposed budget are backed up with numbers and consultation experience. You can modify the budget to fit your own needs.  There is also a lot of discussion about debt reduction.<br />My wife and I read this book about 6 months prior to our wedding; it allowed us time to put into practice the very principles of good money management that Mr. Burkett teaches.  Now these ideas are second nature and easily implimented into our marriage.  Our finances are under control and do not control us!	2002-03-13
US	52763694	R1A847KRMCB3BF	1576737330	89800612	The Prayer of Jabez:  Breaking Through to the Blessed Life	Books	1	9	12	N	N	A dangerous little book	The author unveils in this book some interesting insights into prayer.  He provides a breakdown of his so-called &quot;prayer of Jabez&quot; and how there are some Godly principles that we can glean from the text.<br />However, the author goes way too far.  He seems to indicate that if you pray this prayer then God will bless you.  This sort of cosmic santa claus stuff is one step ahead of the infamous &quot;name-it-and-claim-it&quot; gospel.  The author places way too much emphasis on this prayer and the words inside of it. The &quot;prayer of Jabez&quot; is a classic case of over-reading into the  Scriptures.  Believers in Jesus who read this book should view it with caution.<br />This caution is a shame because there are some good concepts contained within the book.  For example, the author stresses that we should ask the Lord to keep us from sin (as does Jesus!).  With all due respect to the author, anytime someone promises that &quot;repeating some formula&quot; will get you closer to God, it sounds like someone selling something rather than pointing to God.	2001-07-11

You will be amazed at how key experiments throughout the years have forever changed out feelings towards the tissue we call blood.  You will root &quot;for the good guys&quot; as they pioneer medical research! But then you will cry when you see what modern business do once they got a hold of blood as a &quot;product.&quot;  You will see how greed,jealosy, and denial killed thousands and ruined the lives of many others.  All because companies and some doctors would not listen to reason.  Truly heartbreaking indeed.<br />The author composes a beautiful symphony of history which is very easy to read and very difficult to put down.  This book has certainly changed the way I think about business and medicine.	2001-06-25

If CSI is your thing then you will want to read this book to understand the facts and the history of forensics.<br />The book does not go into tremendous detail about criminiology or its techniques.  But if you would like some working knowledge about forensics this book is a good start.  <br />The book is easy to read and will definately peak your interest.	2001-06-17

First, to see the absolute brutality infliced upon a young boy by his mother will bring you to tears.  You will ask &quot;How was this possible?&quot;  Yet it happens.  Secondly, Dave's persistence and eventual freedom from his torture serves as a keen reminder to all of us that we must never give up.  But a warning to potential readers: if you get upset reading testimony of Holocoust survivors and the like, this book will disturb you.  But it is still a must read.	2001-06-09

The author, a Messianiac Jew (believer in Yeshua, or Jesus), delivers a powerful message about the relationship between God and His chosen people, the Jews.  The book dispells a number of commonly held misconceptions about the Jewish people and Christian views of Israel.  He does this through historical writings and Biblical references.  You will be amazed at the number of anti-semitic comments a number of &quot;promminent christians' have made, including popes and Martin Luther.  There is a detailed discussion about some incredible bias from the media; it is all in there.  The author also has many Scriptures to explain those who believe (in error) that the Church has somehow replaced Israel.  All of this is done in a loving, and non-arrogant tone which I appreciated.<br />I would recommend this book to any Christian.  To see the hideous statements/actions made by christians towards the Jews will break you heart, and help you understand God's heart a little better.  I would also recommend this book to any Jew.   You will begin to understand what Yeshua (Jesus) and Rabbi Saul (Paul) really said, and to see that the Christianity in the Bible is not what has been on display in the anti-semitic 'church'.	2001-06-09

The author provides simple descriptions of the concepts of radioactive decay (although sometimes too simple).  The main strength of the text is to make the reader aware that the RMD method is far from perfect by pointing out several key (and often unrealistic) assumptions forced upon the method.<br />He does not provide rigorous science (which was not his point), but rather adequate examples of errors in RMD.  The book is remotely humorous, and is a light read.  Much of the geological data in the book is a bit old (1960's,70's); I don't know if newer data is availible.  If you are looking for a general layman's-terms description of problems in RMD, this is a great place to start. If you want a detailed scientific treatise, this is not for you.	2001-06-07
