For anyone who has followed Tanizaki's work, the stories are ostensibly by a younger Tanizaki; the stories capture hints of the perverse and psychological drama, which he has mastered in his later work.  I must admit, having read many of his later novels first, I found the stories in the collection a bit slow.  Nonetheless, as admier of Tanizaki's literature, I felt the collection gave me a better understanding of his progression and maturity as a writer.  His attention to the psychology of the women characters vis-&agrave;-vis the male protagonist in the title story, \\"A Cat, a Man, and Two Women,\\" reminded me of his novel _Quicksand_, written much later.  The story \\"Professor Rado\\" is arguably a nascent version of _A Diary of a Mad Old Man_, which centralizes trans-generational desire and foot fetishes.  Out of the three stories, \\"The Little Kingdom\\" was my favorite -- it gives the impression that Tanizaki is both an astute and creative social critic.  The story reminded me of the novel _Nip the Buds, Shoot the Children_, by another notable Japanese author, Kenzaburo Oe, where children rule the adult world around them.  The collection is worth a read.	2002-01-29

Each story seems to remark on the fragility and transience of human life.  From the first story, Miserere, centered around aborted fetuses and religion, to the last, Bear &amp; His Daughter, about the renuinion of alcoholic father and daughter, readers will perhaps not see a flicker of optimism in each of Robert Stone's stories.  Despite the dark themes in Stone's stories, reader's will notice the beauty of Stone's narratives.  He is a master crafter, and his words flow with beautiful consistency and intellect.  His sentences were a treat for me to read.  All the stories are particulary strong, my favorite being the title story, Bear &amp; His Daughter.	2001-07-23

I must admit, I first became aware of Nicholas Christopher's fiction with A Trip to the Stars, which I loved and, for obvious reasons, compelled me to read more of his work.  Veronica, however, didn't move me as much as Christopher's follow-up novel.  Veronica is a story that challengers readers to stretch their imaginations and experience a surreal trip through time and space with the main character, Leo.  Christopher's prose is heavily influenced by mysticism, magic, astromony, fantasy and so forth, and makes the dense narrative, at times, a bit cumbersome to navigate through; as one other reviewer noted, it leaves readers feeling &quot;oddly cold.&quot;  Christopher, however, should be commended for how detailed Veronica is, a definite precursor to his, I believe, &quot;breakthrough&quot; novel, A Trip to the Stars. Out of his two novels, I recommend A Trip to the Stars, a more mature and cohesive novel.	2001-07-16

I had bought this book on whim (it was on sale) not knowing what to expect, and I quickly devoured the book like I would a delicious chocolate chip cookie.  The stories are smartly crafted and introspective, but not so introspective as to diminish the irony and often subtle humor of the stories.  Particular highlights of the collection: &quot;Cool Moss,&quot; &quot;Remote Feed,&quot; &quot;Graffiti,&quot; and &quot;Still in Motion.&quot;  I liked &quot;Girl with Large Foot Jumping Rope&quot; the best (the little boy reminded me of myself at that age).  I think what makes this a great collection is that readers will have an easy time empathizing with Gilbert's characters--he writes in the different voices effortlessly.  I anxiously await his next installment.	2001-07-13

As part of the Malinke community in Upper Guinea, Laye captures the layered tradition and culture of his community, deemed, perhaps by most, to be simplistic or primitive compared to today's modern standards.  Yet it is exactly from Layes descriptions of the traditions of his community that we can begin to understand the psychology of the author.  Each chapter is rich with imagery, and his words smack of sincerity and innocence, bringing about an effortless quality and flow to his work--it is as if we are there with Laye experiencing his many transitions, from boyhood to manhood. His descriptions of the communal lifestyle of his people is remarkable. Laye's works like other modern African authors reveal the realities of colonization, and help readers to appreciate and celebrate indigenous African traditions.	2001-07-06

During my read, I felt like I was missing the essence of Kawabata's words (obviously).  A tale of an old man, Shingo, and his immediate family--wife, daughter-in-law, daughter and son--the novel captures the twists and turns of familial bonds.  Shingo narrates this wonderful story, and we learn from his thoughts that age certainly carries with it a yearning for the past, an apathetic outlook for the future, yet, curiously, an appreciation for what is situated in the present.  Kawabata's descriptions of Shingo's thoughts are existential in nature; the narrative is calculated, yet poetic--minimal, yet suffuse with meaning.  I highly recommend.	2001-06-13

It's not surprising that people are left confused after reading Hagedorn's _The Gangster of Love_.  In many ways, it embellishes the postcolonial nightmare of Filipinos, embodied in Rocky Riveras's family, that non-Filipinos may not understand.  As a Filipino American, I must confess, there were parts of the novel that confused me as well.  The read felt cumbersome at times, almost contrived, and cliche.  Rocky Rivera's journey into the American landscape seemed too incredible for a first generation Filipino American to experience.  The novel excels in destabilizing boundaries--ethnic, racial, gender, and sexual--and challenging convential narrative schema.  If her unorthodox construction of chapters and narrative structure was meant to symbolize the dystopic, fragmented, or neocolonial mindset of Filipinos, I don't think Hagedorn was successful.  I don't doubt Hagedorn's innovative talents as an artist and writer.  Her novel _Dogeaters_, is brilliant.  _The Gangster of Love_, unfortunately doesn't compare.	2001-06-12

The translation of Reage's novel is bumpy and broken, and often it is difficult to follow thought patterns and dialogue of the characters.  If readers do manage to make sense of the prose, they will find a story of whips and chains, S/M, bondage, and so forth--actions still considered taboo in most social circles.  Readers will find the central character, O, enigmatic, confounding, and ambivalent: Why would anyone submit themselves to such emotional and phyiscal pain?  Love would be the most obvious answer, but surely Reage was thinking of something more postmodern ... Of course these are purely subjective thoughts of mine.  One must remember, while reading this book, that one's dislike of pain is another's passion.	2001-06-01

Yet, within the space of close to 200 pages, POMOSEXUALS touched upon issues most of us either ignore (because we can) or lack the words to discuss.  And indeed the essays within the anthology managed to challenge assumptions of gender and sexuality, creating, hopefully, words and spaces to talk about the unspeakable.  As the collection proved, gender and sexuality can no longer be thought of in binary notions, rather a full-range of transgressive possibilities exist--which I think is the root of pomosexuality (postmodern sexuality problematizes our assumptions of gender/sexuality). And in my opinion it is exactly those possibilities that make life exciting; such an opinion as shown in several of the essays is threatening even to 'the lesbian and gay community' and especially to society as a whole. I found all the essays well written, provocative, and honest; each of the essays moved me in one sense or another.  This is a collection not to be missed.  It is a quick and enriching read.  My only criticism would be that it wasn't long enough.  I wanted to read more.	2001-01-11

Seventh grade...What a year that was...&quot;  Thirteen was one of those years that only now I can begin to appreciate and laugh at.  I don't know if I'd like to relive  it though.  And this is perhaps why I was so hesitant to pick this book up.  But I'm glad that I did.  The stories are all beautiful.  There isn't one  that stands out the most because they are all so good (most are  bittersweet--prepare yourself).

A HOME AT THE END OF THE WORLD introduced me to Michael Cunningham--someone who I now consider one of my favorite contemporary authors.  He manages to write honestly about friendship, love, sexuality,  and life; and even though the story is told in different voices, there's  hardly a break in the narrative--the novel flows beautifully and keeps  readers turning pages; Cunningham is a master of words.  I found Jonathon's  friendship with Bobby very compelling.  In fact, the chapters in Part I of  the novel are, I think, the best chapters; they reveal the innocence of  youth between Jonathon and Bobby and captures their friendship so  beautifully.  I liked this book a lot because I found it easy to relate to  many of the events and experiences in Jonathon and Bobby's life.  It was  like reading a mirror image of my own life. Novels that are able to draw up  those memories and connections in readers are the best ones. One reading of  this novel isn't enough; it's a novel to be read over and over again.	2000-06-13

The narrative is excellent and quite ambitious, since most of it takes place in colonial America (before &quot;gay,&quot; &quot;queer,&quot;  or &quot;homosexuality,&quot; were constructed); Michael Jensen obviously  did his research.  Because the imagery and setting is so real, readers can  easily empathize with the experiences of the main character, John Chapman.  This isn't a cheap, get-off-quickly dime novel; it's actual literature  that places gay sensibility and eroticism to the forefront.  FRONTIERS, I  think, sets the precedent for other gay novels to come.  I anxiously await  Jensen's next installment. (The cover for the paperback version is hot!)	2000-06-11

Watch Rosie obsession progress from GB's  inauguration, through the Persion Gulf War, and finally to GB's last days  in office.  Her slightly demented logic and determination won me over  instantly.  This novel is all laughs.  Millet's narrative flows from one  chapter to the next, never missing a beat. The way Millet uses the events  occuring during GB's term in ofice to construct Rosie's life is sheer  brilliance and fun.  Lover's of George will most likely hate this book.  But those who had secretly hated him in office will appreciate this book,  no doubt.  Can't wait for the next installment. Watch out Bill, Rosie's  eyeing you.	2000-06-06

It had been a while since I  read any DH, until I picked up SELECTED SHORT STORIES.

It's quite a homoerotic story  about a Captain and his subordinate, telling of DH and his other work in  many ways. The story is compelling, yet tragic, which I liked.

And I suppose when we think of Beats, we automatically think of Jack Kerouac (or Ginsberg or Borroughs)--I know I think of Jack.  JACK KEROUAC: ANGELHEADED HIPSTER was a great find on my  part.  It's a rich visual biography of Kerouac.  The book houses a montage  of beautiful pictures of Jack, et. al, and is designed in a very aesthetic  way--the typeface is supposed to remind us that typewriters did exist back  then (I guess they still do, but their not as popular).  I liked the book  best for it's the photographs Kerouac. The text is not that hard to read,  but if you're looking for more substance about Jack, I recommend you buy  another Kerouac biography.  The book does give you a sense, nonetheless, of  who this legendary man was. For folks that want to see the man the book  calls &quot;The James Dean of the Typewriter,&quot; this book is the one  for you.  I found myself flipping through the book day-dreaming about being  with him during such a revolutionary, exciting, and historic period.

I think it's definitely an  interesting read (or listen) for people who love the study of weather  (though I think the Weather Channel is at times more exciting than this  book), and I highly suggest if you do decide to buy his book, you should  buy the auido version--it's a lot easier to digest.	2000-06-02

The photographs are visually pleasing and very erotic.  This is a unique  collection that certainly merits review.  Roffman's photographs captures  the male form in various stages of passion, as well as in mundane moments;  each definitely tells a story of the men and leaves the viewer to conjure  up stories to fill in the narrative blanks (no pun intended).<br />I highly  recommend THREE.

Add This One to Your Collection	BEEKCAKE: THE MUSCLE MAGAZINES OF AMERICA ought to be reprinted.  It is an essential read for those interested in the contruction of the gay male form/ideal.  BEEFCAKE takes a look at the history of &quot;the  beefcake.&quot;  Simply defined, the beefcake is a male who is physically  built--a bodybuilder or perhaps an Abercrombie and Fitch male model.  What  I found interesting is the beefcake ideal emerged alongside photography,  the most popular mode of getting beefcake images to the masses.  Also  interesting is the how the homoerotic images of the male beefcake form in  the early 1900s weren't automatically linked to homosexuality.  Yes, the  images were homoerotic, but the target audience were straight men.  It was  only later that the gay factor came into play in such publications such as  Physique Pictorial and Tomorrow's Man, which still targeted straight men,  yet pushed the homosocial/erotic boundaries of the men being photographed.  The strength of this book not only lies in the history and research of the  beefcake, but also the photographs included.  The beefcake is everywhere in  popular culture today (in GQ, Mens Health, and other body-building  magazines); he's everywhere in gay male culture too.  BEEFCAKE offers  readers an invaluable insight to the standards of male beauty through the  eyes of both straight and gay men as seen in print/visual media.	2000-05-23

GIOVANNI's  ROOM has established itself as an important queer novel.  First published  over 40 years ago, it captures the life of an expatriate, David, in Paris,  and reveals his transformation.  His transformation is multilayered, a  complex and dynaic affair, yet the most obvious, and arguably, important  one, is his sexual metamorphosis--brought about by Giovanni.  The relevance  of this novel is that most of us can empathize with David's struggle. How  could we not? Balwin's words are rich and compelling.  It lifted me from my  reality into David's, and by the end of the novel (the last two sentences,  I've read 1000 times), I felt like I knew exactly what David had gone  through, because I was there with him, and because I'd been there in my own  life as well.	2000-05-15

MISADVENTURES cracked me up so much, I couldn' put  the book down, and at one point I felt like a fool trying to hold back my  guffaw on the subway--feeling like a bigger fool missing my stop (yet  again).

I enjoyed the movie so much that after the third time, I ran out and bought the book.  The book is absolutely beautiful.  I  remember sitting on the subway reading Maurice and forgetting where I was,  ingnoring everyone around me, and letting the book whisk me away to a time  and place obviously different, yet unfortunately similar in attitude  towards same-sex relationships (I missed my stop).  I couldn't believe  Maurice was written over 80 years ago.  The subject matter seems too  contemporary to be written about during that time, and I suppose that's why  E.M. Forster's novel is so great.  He manages to capture effortlessly the  relationship of Maurice and Clive, as well as to paint a picture of what  life was like back then for gay folk.  Readers can easily transpose many of  the events and experiences in the novel to the present day, which makes  empathizing with Maurice so much easier.  This novel should no doubt be a  required read.  It shares many of the complexities as Forster's other work,  yet perhaps it is glossed over more because of its subject matter--which,  if true, is such a shame.	2000-04-27

But I did like _The End of Alice_, enough to write this review and recommend the book to my circle of friends.  The novel is written with a lot of attention to details; it is as though you can hear the him (the narrator) talking directly to you.  There's one chapter that threw my head  for a spin as I read Chappy's words, his explanation of everything that I  had been thinking prior to that part of the book.  Those who have read the  novel, know what part I'm talking about.  _The End of Alice_ deals with a  slate of issues that most of us would rather shun.  The novel puts it in  our faces, forces us to look at the darker sides of society and life, makes  us question what we really know and feel, and leaves us questioning  ourselves.	2000-04-26

After I read it, I found myself repeating Louis Bowman's name in my head--there's definitely a ring to his name.  Wright captures wonderfully the coming of  age of Louis Bowman through his descriptions of Louis's family life and  life within the projects, as well as Harlem.  It's a dynamic world that  Louis live in and Wright captures every nuance of it perfectly. The novel  was a treat to read, and hopefully we'll see more novels to come from Bil  Wright.	2000-04-25

The narrative is flawless from beginning to end; it lures readers into the world of Einar and Greta, capturing our curiosity and imagination.  Einar's  transformation into Lily is so compelling and real that at times it is as  though both are two separate bodies, independent of each other.  We also  witness the transformation of those within Einar's life, such as Greta,  whose love and support laid the foundation for Einar to become Lily.  Ebershoff's writing is sensitive and honest and is an overall treat for  anyone seeking to read an outstanding novel.  THE DANISH GIRL is by far one  of the best novels that I've read this year.	2000-03-30

I kept thinking that something &quot;more&quot; would happen with Paul, but was let down when I got to the final page of the novel.  The  novel ended abruptly, which left me upset that I had spent the weekend  reading the novel.  I liked Leavitt's collection of short stories,  ARKANSAS, and thought this novel would be similar read.  Unfortunately, it  just left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.	2000-03-26

The narrative is as flawless as the fresh white now that covers the Crell's lawn.  The imagery is rich with emotion and draws  readers into the struggle and survival of the Crell family, drawing us  further into the mind of Danny, the young boy at the heart of the novel.  For most of us, domestic abuse is something unfathomable, that we know only  through TV.  Winter Birds paints an honest, yet disturbing, picture of a  family enduring such pain and surviving till the next day as winter birds  often do.	2000-03-22

From start to finish, Dream Boy capitivated me; the eloquence of the narrative snared me in; and for the short amount of time it took for me to finish it,  I felt I was part of Nathan and Roy's world: breathing the air, feeling the  touches, sensing the love and fear.  It's rare to find a story so  compelling and honest, a story that can move its readers word by word.  Grimsley has written a beautiful novel.	2000-01-24
