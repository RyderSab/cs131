But it wasn't. It turns out that annoying, sarcastic, spoiled brat heroines are MacAlister's stock in trade. What a pity since she writes generally yummy heroes, their only fault being that they actually fall in love with the ditzes MacAlister pairs them up with. Raphael, the hero of The Girl's Guide to Vampires, is as hunky a hero as a romance reader could want, but come on. Any man this intelligent couldn't possible fall for a brat like Joy. One of MacAlister's favorite plot devices is for the &quot;heroine&quot; (and I hesitate to call Joy a heroine) to blow up at the hero and whine like a kid because he's got some secret he can't tell her. Never mind that he's professed his love and has shown tenderness and intensity as a lover, never mind that he wants to protect her. No, instead we're treated to Joy's temper tantrums and crying binges. <br />Another thing MacAlister doesn't make me believe for one minute is that Joy and Roxy are best friends. If any so-called friend sold me out as often as Roxy did Joy in this book, I'd have ditched her long ago. They bicker and snipe at each other so much that I can't buy into the idea of their being acquaintances, let alone friends. Roxy is an even bigger brat that Joy. Maybe they deserve each other. All I know is that I don't deserve another read as unsatisfying as The Girl's Guide to Vampires.	2003-12-14

In Fallen From Grace, Laura Leone has created a completely out-of-the-ordinary romance. It isn't safe, it isn't conventional, and it isn't cliched. In short, it's the most refreshing romance I've read in ages and I wish publishers would encourage more authors to write &quot;outside the box&quot; like this. In Fallen From Grace, Leone pairs up Sara Diamond, a smart, sassy Jewish writer heroine who has recently been dumped by her publisher, with younger man Ryan Kinsmore, a complex hero with a horrific past that has led him to an unlikely career for a romance novel hero...that of expensive prostitute. Instantly smitten when Sara moves in next door, Ryan lies to Sara because he's sure that if she knew the truth about his job that would be the end of any relationship between them. How they work out their obstacles is a treat to be savored. The dialogue is snappy, the pace is brisk, and the romance is touching. I can't recommend it enough.	2003-11-03

Set in an eerie future world where magic and monsters co-exist with reality as we know it (more or less), Sunshine by Robin McKinley is the tale of Rae Seddon, a.k.a. Sunshine, baker extraordinaire at Charlie's Coffeehouse. Her predictable life changes forever when one night she abandons her family's popcorn night for a drive to the lake where she spent time as a child. She ends up being captured by vampires and left as the main meal for powerful vampire, Constantine, who has also been captured and is in shackles. His choice not to feed on Sunshine leads her to make the choice of saving his life come daybreak. Their mutual choices create an unlikely bond between them that together makes them stronger and able to take on the enemy who would destroy them both.<br />The book is fascinating, if not perfect. Far too much time is spent on Sunshine's ruminations at the cost of a pace better suited to the last 60 or so pages of the book. At first, the time spent in Sunshine's head was interesting; after a while it got tedious and I often thought, &quot;Get on with it!&quot; But if you're into atmosphere and funky visions of the future and what might be hiding in the shadows, Sunshine might be up your alley.	2003-11-03

Tolkien's achievement ranges from the epic to the intimate, painting a canvas which draws the reader in and makes us feel deeply for the characters. It is difficult to sum up in a few words what LoTR is about: the struggle between the forces of good and evil certainly, but it's also about loyalty and friendship and honor and difficult choices and sacrifice and hope...woven in a rich tapestry involving the creation of beings and languages that came solely from Tolkien's imagination. You will laugh, you will cry, you will never forget experiencing Middle Earth for the first time. If your first exposure to Tolkien is through Peter Jackson's movies, now treat yourself to the whole story. Middle Earth awaits!	2003-01-15

It is very nearly superfluous to comment on The Lord of the Rings. No other work of fantasy fiction comes close to the depth and breadth realized by Tolkien in this master work. Yes, it's about the age-old conflict between good and evil set in a world populated by men, elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards, and orcs. But at the heart of The Lord of the Rings is a moving tale of loyalty and friendship that reminds us how the relationships we forge in life can sustain us through our darkest hours. This is fiction at its finest -- fiction meant to savor and to return to again and again. It has the power to frighten, to uplift, and to break your heart.	2002-01-08

While Ronsard is certainly a complex, fascinating &quot;villain,&quot; Linda Howard in no way skimped on the characterization of her black ops hero, Medina. Coupled with a strong, feisty heroine in Niema Burdock, Medina is introduced to the reader in wonderful scenes -- escaping from Iran following a mission gone wrong, training with Niema for a mission to bring down arms dealer Ronsard, pursuing her with single-minded intensity at Ronsard's villa. It's a fascinating world of shadows Medina lives in and Howard's gift is showing us the importance of Niema to him, how her spirit and love of adventure provides the light and warmth this strong man needs. I have read just about everything Linda Howard has written and in my estimation, she has successfully moved from romance to romantic suspense without losing the ability to pair terrific men and women. She also writes some of the best sex in the business, and if there's less of it in her more recent works, well, trust me, what she does write is guaranteed to scorch!	2001-04-07

Even more impressive, she makes the reader care about each sub-plot. The book starts off with a bang when Meg Moore is informed that her daughter and grandmother have been kidnapped by Kazbekistani extremists. They want Meg to kill or bring them a K-stani terrorist in exchange for the lives of her family. Faced with impossible choices, Meg asks for help from Navy SEAL John Nilsson, a man with whom she has a complicated past. At the same time, Meg's grandmother, Eve, keeps her granddaughter, Amy, from being afraid by telling her about the first love of her life in the days before Britain's involvement in WWII. Adding spice to the mix, Brockmann reintroduces Navy SEAL Sam Starrett and once Navy now FBI agent, Alyssa Locke, two adversaries who are wildly attracted despite tremendous differences. The book is fast-paced, the dialogue is crisp and resonates with authenticity, the characters all compelling. Bring on the next one in this fantastic series, Suzanne!	2001-03-21

The plot is straightforward: on behalf of Louis, who is still guilt-ridden over child-vampire Claudia, David Talbot approaches his former pupil and enamorata, Merrick Mayfair, with a request to raise Claudia's ghost. A relative of the poweful Mayfair witches, Merrick joined the Talamasca at the age of 14 and has tremendous powers. As she has in other books, Rice employs a great deal of recollection. Much of this book involves David recounting his relationship with Merrick for Louis. Fortunately, these recollections are interesting and inform the reader, as much as Louis, what forces have shaped Merrick. When the action settles into the present and Merrick raises Claudia from the dead, it's a great rollercoaster ride to the finish, full of surprises. I hadn't read a Vampire Chronicle since I threw MEMNOCH THE DEVIL against the wall in frustration. If you've been waiting for Rice to return to form, MERRICK is for you. I closed this book with a smile on my face!	2001-02-21

Every time I saw that I always found myself saying, &quot;Hey, I'll go!&quot; If you've ever fantasized about gorgeous aliens landing on Earth, extending their hands and saying, &quot;Come with me to the stars,&quot; this book is for you. The heroine and hero, Jas and Rom, meet on a sort of dream plane when she's a young fighter pilot during the Gulf War and he's the heir to a powerful alien family who has gone against his family's wishes to eradicate a powerful cult leader. Their encounter destroys both of their lives. When they meet 20 years later, Rom's race has just made first contact with Earth. Jas sees Rom on television and recognizes him as the man who has haunted her dreams. She sneaks her way on to Andrews Air Force Base and cons her way on board Rom's vessel. At that point, sparks fly, because of course, Rom recognizes Jas as the woman who has haunted *his* dreams. Lest this sound very angst-ridden, I must hasten to say it is not. THE STAR KING is a delightful, humor-filled romance about two intelligent, mature people who discover that love the second time around is the best.	2001-02-09

Due to one man's destructive obsession, the heroine, Belinda Hamilton, is ruined. Seeing no alternative, she becomes a courtesan, a course of action she hopes will give her a measure of revenge against the man who destroyed her life. Robert Knight, the &quot;Paragon Duke,&quot; has his own reasons for seeking revenge against the same man. Seeing Belinda as Dolph Breckinridge's major weak spot, Robert makes her his mistress in name only. Happily for the reader, sparks fly immediately, and the ensuing love story is both charming and emotional. Belinda brings joy and unconventionality into Robert's life while his love heals the hurt she suffered at the hands of a brutal attacker. Interesting secondary characters, including Belinda's bookish father and Robert's headstrong little sister add richness to the story. If Foley's plans include books for each of Robert's brothers, I hope she hurries! She knows how to write a to-die-for hero. Robert is principled, yet passionate; intelligent, sensitive, and witty.

Zachary Bronson, like Grant Morgan and Derek Craven before him, fought his way out of poverty. Using his intellect and ambition, he has made himself wealthy and powerful. All he lacks is respect and manners. To this end, he hires Lady Holland Taylor, a beautiful widow who literally stumbles into his arms at a ball. Neither Zach nor Holly can forget their magical embrace. Zach, used to getting what he wants, invites Holly to his home and convinces her to bring her adorable daughter and live with him and his family -- for 30,000 pounds she will teach them how to behave among the haute ton. Unlike so many widows in romance novels, Holly genuinely loved her husband, George, so much so that she is shocked and frightened by her growing feelings for Zach. For Zach, an unapologetic rake, finding himself falling in love with Holly is heartbreaking. Sure that he will never be worthy of her, he fights his attraction while wondering how he will survive without her. Many things stand in the way of a future for them, including a deathbed promise Holly made to George. It's a hard road for Zach and Holly. But hard won happy endings make for deeply satisfying romance reads. Bravo, Lisa Kleypas.	2000-09-29

Tom Paoletti is a Navy SEAL in  trouble. After sustaining a life-threatening head injury he's ordered to  take 30 days off to rest. One small problem: at the airport he spots a  terrorist thought dead. The brass all think he has a screw loose. Luckily  his Uncle Joe and Joe's best friend, Charles, two WWII vets, are willing to  believe Tom and help him. Charles is dying and mad as hell at Joe for  wanting to talk to an author about their time with the French Resistance.  Tom's immediate need forces the friends into a truce and not a moment too  soon. Tom's other problem is his overwhelming attraction to Charles's  daughter Kelly. He's always loved her. She's always loved him. But can a  SEAL commit? Can a woman afraid of failing at marriage twice commit? A  third thread adds to the rich tapestry of THE UNSUNG HERO in Tom's troubled  niece, Mallory, and her burgeoning relationship with a loveable geek.  Believe it or not, Suzanne Brockman weaves all these stories into a  satisfying whole, combining not one, but three love stories, including one  told in flashbacks to WWII. The flashbacks are never distracting and  provide a powerful setup for one of the most dramatic finishes to a book  I've read in a long, long time.	2000-08-22

Combining his logic with her quirky intuition, the pair take off for  Martha's Vineyard with Blooey the chef and Hambone the cat in tow, to  investigate a B&amp;B's culinary-based haunting. Joy treats us to sparkling  dialogue and as amusing a supporting cast of characters as you'll find  anywhere. As if investigating a ghost wasn't enough fun, we also get to  witness Tyber's hilarious challenge to Zanita to prove that marriage would  kill the passion in their relationship.

Feehan's Carpathians are an interesting twist to the  vampire legend and over the course of the first four books in the Dark  Saga, her world-building has been excellent. She writes taut action  sequences and does a lovely job with description. But her uneven pacing and  overuse of certain phrases -- in DARK MAGIC it's &quot;molten mercury&quot;  when describing Gregori's eyes -- really bog down each book and keep them  from being 5-star reads. As in the previous books, the couple's challenge  is to bond while hunting vampires and/or human members of the secret  society of vampire killers. Some variation on this theme in future Dark  Saga releases needs to happen to keep the series fresh.	2000-08-14

After all, the heroine is a breast cancer survivor. As a fan of Kathleen Eagle, I was looking forward to her treatment of a sensitive issue, for the people who have/had breast cancer  and those who love them. But Savannah Stephens, the heroine in question,  very nearly deep sixes all Ms. Eagle's good intentions. Self-involved to  the point of pathetic, she spends 95% of the book so prickly and unkind to  Clay, the wonderful hero, a man who has always loved her, that she becomes  very nearly irredeemable. She has a wonderful, intelligent daughter who  adores her, so her reluctance to get out of bed in the morning at the  beginning of the book is mind-boggling. She marries her best friend for the  sake of her daughter's security, then refuses to share his bed or let him  touch her. Clay, meanwhile, suffers a wealth of hurt and dismay as he  learns that simply having this woman in his life is not enough. He needs  her trust him with her pain, and her withholding of that trust makes this  book one of the saddest I have ever read. In the end, as you would expect,  Savannah comes around, and when she does it's like all the ice she was  buried under melts away to reveal a woman who knows she'd be a fool to let  go of such a fantastic man. The finaly chapter saved this book for me and  brought it up to a 4-star, as opposed to 3-star, read.	2000-07-25

In the case of Jonet, A WOMAN SCORNED's heroine, it's Capt. Cole Amherst she wants. Despite the fact that he seems to have been sent by her worst enemy  to spy on her following the mysterious circumstances surrounding her  husband's death, and despite the fact that the pair couldn't be more  different, Jonet realizes that she needs Cole. She needs his decency, she  needs his friendship, she needs the security she feels with him...and, oh  yes, it doesn't hurt that he's gorgeous! Liz Carlyle turns the usual  romance plot upside down by having the heroine doing the pursuing. Cole is  a fascinating hero -- orphaned at 12, he was raised by a manipulative  uncle. Destined to be a vicar, Cole abandoned that ambition to join the  Army, in part to escape from a loveless marriage. In Jonet, he finds  passion and real love. That she has two wonderful sons he was sent to  tutor, but soon comes to care for deeply just makes Jonet's attraction that  much harder to ignore. There's a nifty mystery in this book as well. While  seasoned mystery readers may identify the culprit early on, I did not, and  greatly appreciated the building tension, sexual and otherwise! Fans of MY  FALSE HEART will be happy to learn that Ms. Carlyle is not a &quot;one hit  wonder.&quot; If you like your romances sweet, A WOMAN SCORNED is probably  not for you.

After years of working from France, she is called to the small  village of WINTER GARDEN in southern England, to work in concert with  fellow spy, Thomas Blackwood. Together they pose as scholar and translator  as they work to uncover an opium smuggling operation. The heart of this  fine novel, however, is the relationship between Thomas and Madeleine.

For her part, Madeleine cannot  imagine any other life but the one she's lead. Fearful of love, she wants  only an affair with Thomas, physically satisfying, yet something she will  be able to walk away from at the end of their assignment. In addition to  the strong dialogue there are gorgeous, sizzling love scenes that are not  in the least gratuitous; in fact, they are absolutely integral to advancing  the relationship between Thomas and Madeleine.

Pious, self-righteous Serena  means to refuse, but after being rescued from Lucien, Marquess of  Clayborne, she finds she can't resist him. They make love, she conceives,  the duke is murdered. At this point you might expect Serena to be grateful  for Lucien's insistence that they marry. He wishes to protect her, but  fearful ad nauseum ad infinitum of being perceived as wanton as her mother,  Serena balks. I didn't like Serena. In addition to acting &quot;too stupid  to live&quot; on more than one occasion, her over-the-top moral stand  becomes old in a hurry.

By the end of SECRETS OF THE NIGHT, I'd finally begun to see a human behind all the glamour and power. In DEVILISH, Jo Beverley does a masterful job of chipping away at Rothgar's carefully constructed walls, breaking her readers' hearts a little along the way.  Diana is the perfect heroine for Rothgar -- strong, intelligent, not afraid to take risks for the man she loves, and utterly determined to save him from himself for both their sakes. Rothgar and Diana's adventures on the way to London and then amidst the court of King George III were exciting, amusing, and filled with wonderful dialogue. No one knows the Georgian era better than Jo Beverley, and her portrayal of the king and queen brought them alive as no history book ever could.

Anne, a  middle-aged spinster has spent her life caring for her elderly parents. Now  that they are dead she has the money to spend on Michel des Anges, the male  prostitute she's fancied since her coming out at age 18 and has purchased  to fulfill all her womanly desires for one month. Michel/ Michael has a  deadly secret. Scarred in a fire, he has spent the last five years  celibate, lonely, and hungry for the unflinching touch of a woman. Upon  discovering that Anne desires him despite the scars, he wants more -- one  month as her lover, not as a whore...assuming his secret won't kill her  first. While I found Anne and Michael as sympathetic as Elizabeth and  Ramiel  from THE LADY'S TUTOR, I didn't get to know them. THE LOVER happens  over a period of days, not months, during which time Anne and Michael are  having sex more than talking. Thus, at the end I felt cheated of the  emotional connection between them that would guarantee a &quot;happily ever  after.&quot; I also felt cheated by the price. Even with Amazon's generous  discount, paying this much for a 310 page novel is robbery. Still, the  mystery here is gripping, disturbing, and well-executed and, upon reading  THE LOVER a second time, I felt Ms. Schone did almost as fine a job at  dropping clues as did M. Night Shyamalan with &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot;	2000-04-10

It's not especially well-written and the love story barely intersects with the Scottish history circa Bruce/Wallace. Also, based on previous reviews I  expected a much sexier story. Instead, the so-called erotic interludes  frequently had me rolling my eyes. The idea of Lynx wanting Jane as little  more than a brood mare gets the romance off to a decidedly unromantic  start. Henley is a better writer than this; TEMPTED remains a favorite of  mine. But while she did an admirable job with the history, much of the  character and plot development suffered. Jane's sister had a part to play  in an attempt on the life of Jane and Lynx's unborn child, yet once the  scheme is laid bare, the sister is never mentioned again. Same goes with  Jane's brothers; after Jane is kidnapped, they get tossed in the dungeon  and are never mentioned again. Henley should have used her word count more  wisely -- instead of mentioning Lynx's tawny hair and Jane's lush breasts  ad nauseum ad infinitum, she should have tied up all the loose ends.	2000-03-22

Within pages of the beginning of the book she separates Elizabeth and Nathaniel, the heroine and hero she brought to life in INTO THE WILDERNESS. In the middle of winter Elizabeth  delivers twins, but when the couple learns that Nathaniel's father,  Hawkeye, and their friend Robbie MacLachlan are in prison in Canada,  Nathaniel sets off to free them. He ends up being arrested, and this  triggers a thrilling chain of events that leads the Bonner family and their  friend, Curiosity Freeman, all the way to Scotland where they become the  unwilling participants in age old political and religious conflict. Donati  continues to explore the evolving relationship between Elizabeth and  Nathaniel while bringing Nathaniel's daughter from his first marriage,  Hannah, front and center. The end leaves open the possibility of further  additions to Donati's saga. This is very good news, indeed, for her many  readers who have come to care about this marvelous cast of characters. (And  any book which cleverly manages to give Scottish poet Robert Burns a cameo  is a winner in this reviewer's estimation!)	2000-03-20

When a writer creates a compelling hero and heroine, brings the reader into the world of those characters and  makes us care about them...why not bring them back? Thankfully, Nora  Roberts (as JD Robb) continues to do just this with NYPSD homicide  detective Eve Dallas and her gabillionaire husband, Roarke. Over the course  of the In Death series, we have watched their fascinating relationship  begin, bloom and grow. As a married couple they are even more exciting than  they were in the beginning. Surrounded by a strong supporting cast, Eve and  Roarke are two of the most fully realized characters in all of fiction. In  WITNESS IN DEATH, a murder takes place on stage during a live theatre  performance in front of an audience of thousands. Following Eve's  relentless pursuit of the truth, while continuing to battle her personal  demons, is fascinating as always. Roberts continues to flesh out Peabody  and MacNab while keeping the focus on Eve and Roarke. Romantic suspense,  heck, fiction doesn't get much better than this.	2000-03-15

Despite the fact that the politics are idealistic and the plot somewhat far-fetched, this is a highly entertaining read. Cornelia Case, widow of an assassinated president, forced to continue in the role of First Lady,  escapes the White House and watchful eyes of the Secret Service to begin a  road trip to ordinary life. Along the way her car is stolen and she meets  ex-journalist-looking-for-a-story Mat Jorik and the two children his  ex-wife claimed were his on their birth certificates. The girls, Lucy and  Button, are wonderful characters, Mat makes a perfect tough guy with a soft  heart hero. And Nealy makes an appealing heroine. Don't take this one too  seriously and you'll enjoy yourself immensely. I would have given it 5  stars, but the corny epilogue ruined it for me. The novel should have ended  in Mabel the Winnebago where the love story began.	2000-03-06

There he meets the Queen of the Clink, beautiful and dangerous Vivian Swift, a woman full of  contradictions, a woman he cannot help but love. Loaded with intrigue,  HEART OF DECEPTION is intelligent, dark, and sexy. The plot is  labyrinthine, but so well developed, and the characters so finely detailed,  that the reader cannot help but be drawn into the endlessly fascinating web  of deceit surrounding Rafe and Vivian's relationship. And what a  relationship! Anger and passion are rarely so well blended. Don't miss this  outstanding novel.	2000-03-01

I like the idea of modern women finding themselves in some distant past, trying to cope with the necessary changes in lifestyle, and certainly  Lisa Cach did a fine job of writing heroine Elle's dilemmas. But the story  never really took off for me. I liked the hero, Henry, a lot more than Elle  did for most of the book, and while I sympathized with her dilemma, I found  her actions and words too often cruel. Mainly, though, I just couldn't get  behind the idea of a trip to the past courtesy of a fairy coupon for a free  husband.	2000-02-24

What you will find, however, are some of the most gorgeously realized illustrations ever.  Cherif Fortin is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful humans on the  face of the planet and since he's featured in the majority of the images,  what you have in PASSION'S BLOOD is a feast for the visual sense...not to  mention fodder for fantasies galore! PASSION'S BLOOD is an illustrated  erotic fairy tale for adult women -- no more than that, but certainly no  less.	2000-02-24

Edwards calls in his favor and Anita hightails it to New Mexico to assist the police in solving a series of horrific mutilations/murders. Good news for Edward fans, unless unmasking Death takes away all the mystery. Bad  news for Jean-Claude and Richard fans. Our resident Master of the City and  Ulfric make what amounts to cameo appearances in OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY. Which  isn't to say it's a bad book, no, not at all. It's engrossing,  action-packed, gory, funny...entertaining. But looking at the larger  picture, one can't help but wonder: *Has* Hamilton written herself into a  corner with regard to the Anita/Jean-Claude/Richard triumvirate? In  OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY, we find Anita still fighting against the threesome,  still waffling over what to do. So Anita's adventure in NM feels more like  an evasive manuever on Hamilton's part than an attempt to satisfy Edward  fans. We could have found out more about Edward in a story set in St.  Louis, along with Anita and the local vamps and werewolves. Edward's  backups, Olaf and Bernardo, could have just as easily shown up in St.  Louis. Bottom line: while this is an entertaining standalone read, one  can't help but wonder why Laurell K. doesn't go for it and make Anita, J-C,  and Richard a fully-functioning triumvirate. Surely J-C is seductive enough  to convince Richard to share!	2000-01-21

Josie Baum -- cook, housekeeper, mother to 15 brothers -- is dumped at a brothel by her stepfather, then kidnapped by Long Belly, a Cheyenne native as a gift for his ailing brother-in-law,  Daniel. Josie had the misfortune of seeing her brother and father killed by  Indians and because of this, some rancor toward Long Belly was to be  expected. But it lasted far too long and was far too mean-spirited. It  should not have taken thickheaded Josie as long as it did to let go of her  hatred toward all Indians, especially not in the face of overwhelming  evidence against her prejudices. That her racism was couched in weak  attempts at humor made UNTAMED that much more unpalatable. If you have any  concern or love for Native Americans, don't bother with this offensive  book.	1999-12-30

Her charming retelling of The Ugly Duckling takes intelligent, but socially awkward  Isadora Peabody aboard the aptly named Silver Swan, where her adventures as  Captain Ryan Calhoun's translator, allow her to blossom. Dashing rake Ryan  has never met a woman like stubborn Isadora, the first woman to ever make  him feel his worth. Together, they are magic. Don't miss this wonderful  book.

In it, two conniving brothers with an agenda of their own, arrange for linguist and philologist, Edwina Bollash,  to make a gentleman out of ratcatcher, Mick Tremore, in just six weeks.  Mick may be impoverished in circumstance, but Edwina soon learns that he is  rich with the sheer joy of living. Through him Edwina, tall and in her  mind, unattractive, learns to appreciate herself and learn to love life as  much as the man she cannot help but love. This novel is full of smiles,  laughs, a bit of intrigue, redemption, and joy. Treat yourself to THE  PROPOSITION.	1999-12-30

Eve Duncan, the forensic sculptor obsessed with  bringing &quot;the lost ones&quot; (including her own daughter) home,  should have been an enormously sympathetic character. Instead, her  prickliness and wariness wore thin in a hurry. I never felt any sort of  real connection between Eve and her men, Logan and Joe. I barely felt a  connection between Eve and her mother. In short, Johansen couldn't make me  care for any of the so-called protagonists. As a result, I won't be reading  anymore Eve Duncan novels or anymore Johansen for that matter. If you want  to read excellent serializations with strong female protagonists, I  recommend J.D. Robb's In Death series, Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum  series, or Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series.	1999-11-29

It spends far too much time in the heads of the protagonists as they rehash the same thoughts over and over again: Colin thinking how brave, strong and stubborn Seana  is; Seana thinking what a heart breaking rogue Colin is. Yeah, I got it the  first time. And while Crosby makes lame attempts to convince the reader  that these two people belong together, she drags in a subplot involving  characters from THE MACKINNON'S BRIDE that completely lacks in tension and  takes time away from Colin and Seana. Another beef: Crosby's horrible  Scottish dialogue which lacks continuity and is so overdone as to be  virtually unreadable at times. (For a good example of Scottish dialect,  read Gabaldon.) Finally, for a romance novel there is surprisingly little  sexual tension and the one and only consummated sex scene is interrupted by  an out-of-place attempt at humor. If you want to read a decent romance set  in medieval times, read anything by Patricia Ryan. Not a single aspect of  Crosby's book makes it impossible to set at any other time in history.	1999-08-19

Buy this book, but save Robin Schone's &quot;A Lady's Pleasure&quot; for last. If only it were a full-length novel! &quot;Captivated&quot; by Beatrice Small seems to suggest that erotica is  best served in a fantasy setting. It didn't take long before the incessant  focus on the Prince's manhood became laughable. The &quot;hero&quot; of  Susan Johnson's &quot;Bound and Determined&quot; was so vulgar at the  beginning of the story that I never came to care for him. If you like lots  of bondage and what amounts to mental abuse, you may enjoy Thea Devine's  &quot;Dark Desires.&quot; Too bad the &quot;hero&quot; couldn't figure out  a more romantic way than keeping his unwilling wife naked and in a thrall  collar to make her love him. I won't deny that the first three stories lack  in plenty of sex. They're just completely devoid of heart. Robin Schone  proves time and again that erotic tales can have emotional depth, that the  two people involved can truly care for each other and increase the depth of  that caring even as they satisfy each other sexually. In &quot;A Lady's  Pleasure,&quot; Robert Coally is a true hero and Abigail a true heroine.  Their happy ending was the only one that brought me a sense of joy. Thank  you, Robin.	1999-08-18

Olivia Bond feels unworthy of love because of the year she spent as Darcy Lankanal's sex toy. Reclusive Noah LaCroix feels unworthy of love because  of his severe facial scars. When Noah rescues Olivia after she gets lost in  the swamp while on the run from Darcy, they begin to care for each other.  Wonderful idea, yet two things bothered me. First, two such appealing  characters in a romance novel deserve far more in the way of a sexual  pay-off. More should have been made of Noah's loss of virginity. The  build-up in tension between Olivia and Noah was never given a decent  outlet. Second, and more serious, the last part of the book spent way too  much time on Darcy and a shaky attempt to clean up his image in preparation  for a novel of his own. I'm sorry, Jill, but Darcy is no hero.	1999-08-18

Never mind the frank discussions of sex and anatomy. Put all that aside and what you have is a poignant, beautiful love story about two lonely people who find each other. Elizabeth has been stuck  in a loveless, passionless marriage for 16 years. Half Arab and Half  English, Ramiel, Lord Safyre, the Bastard Sheik, has been running from his  past. When Elizabeth asks Ramiel to tutor her in the art of seduction so  that she can woo her husband from his mistress, not only do sparks fly, but  their mutual healing begins as well. Much of this book is sad enough to  make you want to cry. The frank eroticism is absolutely justified as Ramiel  teaches Elizabeth that she is beautiful and desirable and that there is  nothing sinful about a woman's passion. If there's a prudish bone in your  body, you won't be comfortable with this story. If a stronger erotic  element doesn't offend you, you will love this book.	1999-07-08

Adultery is often a tough sell to fans of the genre, but in Beverley's deft hands, the adultery is not only  understandable, but both hero and heroine are made to suffer for an  arrangement that becomes a love match. The wonderful hero, Brand Malloren,  is very different than his siblings. If this is your first Malloren novel,  don't worry, you do not need to have read the others to enjoy this one. But  I'm betting you'll want to know more, especially about the intriguing  Marquess of Rothgar, Brand's oldest brother. One of Jo Beverley's strengths  is her heroines who are reliably feisty and capable. Rosamunde is no  different. Scarred from an accident during adolescence and married to a  much older man, you can't help but forgive her for falling in love with  Brand, the man she needs to father her child for the sake of others. Jo  puts a lot of obstacles in Brand and Rosa's path, which makes their ending  all the sweeter.	1999-07-06

Rio and Carlie spend so much of this novel disliking and  distrusting each other that their whiz-bang gee-I-love-you revelations at  the end left me shaking my head. Rio is an appealing, if somewhat  unbelievable, hero. Carlie has enough back story issues for two tortured  heroines. They needed to spend a lot more time together on the page  communicating calmly and rationally instead of hurling accusations at one  another. That time should have come from the excessive amount of time  allotted to secondary characters such as Danny and Jo Ellen (both of whom  had enough issues to fill an entire novel). Forster starts with an  interesting premise, but the execution could have been a lot smoother.	1999-07-06

SILKEN THREADS is a clever, well-plotted, sexy tale inspired by the Hitchcock film &quot;Read Window.&quot; Graeham Fox is in  London to fetch home the daughter of his master who suspects she is being  abused by her husband, Rolf le Fever. But before Graeham can spirit her  away, he is brutally attacked. Rescued by a stranger, he is taken to the  home of the man's sister, Joanna Chapman, a merchant's wife. Close to being  destitute, Joanna agrees to let Graeham rent her storeroom while his broken  leg heals. The storeroom just happens to have a perfect view of le Fever's  home, allowing Graeham to observe all manner of comings and goings, as well  as his beautiful landlady whom he can't help but fall in love with.  Hitchcock's movie is fun, but Patricia Ryan's SILKEN THREADS is fun and  sexy.	1999-07-06
