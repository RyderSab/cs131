I also liked the sequence of events, like Jack and Annie going into the schoolhouse, the grasshopper attack started, and then Jack an Annie left, and then came back because of the tornado, and then they went in to the storm cellar just in time, and then the tornado hit, and they were still safe.  So overall, it was one fascinating, scary, and wonderful book.  If you miss this one, you won't know what you're missing.  So take my advice and read this book.	2002-02-01

It's a good book with lots of facts, details, and information about the Revolutionary War.  Also, why I feel heartbroken was that when General George Washington read the scroll written by Thomas Paine, those words gave me a sort of feeling, maybe not a heartbroken feeling, but it seemed like a heartbraking feeling for a moment.  Oh well, I don't care what feeling it was.  I just am happy I read this book, and if you read it you'll know why I like this Magic Tree House book, and many others in the series, like paradise.  Happy Reading!	2002-01-30

So the only choice being to follow the black cat, they follow him into a pyramid, and the fun begins.  What happens next?  You'll have to read the exciting book, &quot;Mummies In The Morning&quot;.

First of all, Peanut is acting strange, and running back and forth on the letter &quot;M&quot;.  So Jack and Annie leave him in the tree house and go on the moon to find the M thing.  When they find a moon buggy, they go exploring, and later find an American flag with a note by it.  Jack and Annie make their own note, then are about to go back when they see a moon man.  Jack tries to communicate with him by notes, and then the moon man draws a map of stars.  When they go back to the tree house, they can't go home for some reason.  You'll have to read the rest for yourself.  <br />There's one thing I want to say.  What makes this book neat is that they are transported to the future instead of being transported back in time.  That can really make the book way more interesting.  So if I were you, I wouldn't miss this one, which is my 3rd best.	2001-11-13

But still, this book was tremendously good.  Why it was good was because of what happened in the end.  Also, it's a cool idea to have Mary Pope Osborne (Aunt Mary, as said in the story) and her two sons, Andrew and Peter, with her.  I just think that there's nothing like it.  There are some really neat parts at the end, as well, like visiting Morgan's library.  Well, this book was the best and I'm not telling you anymore.  It's too good to spoil, except I can tell you that this is such a great learning book it could be a documentary movie.  This is undoubtley one of Mrs. Osborne's best, and it will be your best, too.

But not for long, because there's a wet dog smell and snoring, which confirms that there's a cave bear in there!  Well, read the rest for yourself.  Also, if you want my opinion of the book, this is undoubtley one of Mrs. Osborne's best.  <br />Also, there's something I want to tell all the people who read this book.  On Encarta, I found out that the first Humans lived in the epoch that's the beginning of the Ice Age, namely the Pliestocene Epoch.  I thought that it would be impossible for humans to live way back then, but this book showed me that Encarta was right, and gave me additional information.  If you're doing research on the Ice Age, this will be a book you don't want to miss.  Enjoy!	2001-11-07

Besides, they leave out a lot on the book, like when Izzy said, &quot;If I'm not mistaken, that noise precedes an eruption.&quot;  On the video, is was an exclamation point, or his voice seemed like the sentence needed an exclamation point.

I'm not sure they call it a kids series, but it sure seems like one.  Anyway, back to the book.  The Pet is where Jake and Nog make friends with a pet that they call Babe.  It's been a while since I've read this book, but the end is where an alien ship (as good, and slightly better than the Borg) comes to the space station and does a tiny attack, and the masked commander claims that a &quot;prince&quot; is aboard DS9.  I knew who that prince was right away.  However, the crew and Jake and Nog don't.  Even though Sisko sounds innocent and dosen't know where the prince is, they still attack.  I can't remember when or how, but later Jake and Nog find out who the prince is, and go to Ops (I like to say the bridge) with Dr. Bashir, and Babe does something incredible...  I'm not telling you any more, except that unless it was a very good story I wouldn't be writing this much.  So if you see this book, get it no matter what.  Enjoy it.	2001-10-17

It's also a great book on genetic engineering and science.  It's amazing about Rhee doing his tricks, and the action is normal, but wonderfully done.  So take the time to read this book, and you won't think there's any better Hardy Boys book (and it's true, you'll believe me).  Bon Reading it! (Enjoy reading it)!	2001-10-17

This also contained some exciting events, such as Chet and Cap capturing Willie, all the captures of the criminals, the Hardys, and Harry.  Also, it was weird of how the plane accident was caused at the beginning, because it all happened too quick.  But too fast or not, you can't miss this one.	2001-10-16

Also, in one way this book can be sort of hilarious near the middle.  It's where Senor Segovia says, &quot;I'm sure I know where Carson Drew is, because of a source of information I have.&quot;  Yeah right, like they can get him that easily!  But still, it's funny and later Segovia is correct.  So it's a good book, even though that part may have been the author's big mistake.	2001-10-10

Otherwise, I don't know what else to say about this book, and I'm glad because I don't want to spoil a single surprise.	2001-10-10

I mean, it's still tremendous, but the action isn't the best, but good enough.  My favorite part is the part where Jack and Annie face a terrible time getting back to the tree house.  Also, the funny part is at the time mentioned above, and at the beginning of the story.  It's where Jack and Annie discover lions dislike giraffes.  I get the reason, but it was still very funny.  Also, I didn't know that giraffes could give a big kick like that.  Well, I'm not going to spoil the book, so read it for yourself, and I guarantee you'll love it even though it may not be the best.	2001-10-10

I like buffalo and Indians, especially because of what fun they cause on good western movies, like \\"How The West Was Won\\", and the Indians got of to a good start in \\"Stagecoach\\", \\"The War Wagon\\", and especially \\"The Pony Express.  Another reason why this book exceeds 5,000 stars is because of all the fun there is, it seems like a Hardy Boys book rather than a learning book.  But for some reason I'm starting to think that the more action there is in a Magic Tree House book, the more learning topics the book has.  Definitely one of the Top Five, too good to say Top Ten.	2001-10-10

It's probably the best, not because of the plot, action, and its contents, but because of its extrordinary learning power. I know so much about the Titanic because I saw the movie, but this gave me tons of additional information. I don't know how Mrs. Osborne does it, because it seems that it's just a book with more action than imaginable, but it turns out to be the best way of learning. So whoever reads this review, I think that you would more than love this book.	2001-10-10
