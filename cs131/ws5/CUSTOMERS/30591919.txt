But what drove Jenny Weaver to such an extent has Sara Linton, Jeffrey Tolliver and Lena Adams on the trail. Like in Blindsighted, Lena was the most believable, likeable character. Jeffrey was too \\"woe is me\\", and Sara was bitchy towards her sister Tessa and Lena. A highly disturbing read but well worth your time. (A+)	2003-08-23
US	30591919	RJD9IT9XXWIU5	0689851790	516343537	Super Edition: Before Gaia	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Thrilling	This book was brilliant. This young adult action/mystery series is about Gaia Moore, a New Yorker born without the fear gene. This book goes back to explain about how troubled and dangerous her parents' lives were. While some questions were answered, one still remains - how did Katia Moore end up dead? Slow to start, but built up dramatically into an absolute thriller. (A+)	2003-08-23

Amongst the letters of boy troubles is thirteen-year-old Nicola O'Connell's letter declaring that Dave is her father, and it's true. And while the newfound relationship between father and daughter is going great, Dave hurts his wife with the truth. An insightful and entertaining look on the modern man, and I really enjoyed this.

Here, violence isn't described in graphic detail - instead are words of endless encouragement, support and inspiration.<br />A calming, relaxing read for a lazy day, there is nothing here to harm your soul. One message continually shows up within the numerous poems - turn darkness into light, and no longer sit around waiting for something that may never come. Take the future in your own hands and make a difference.<br />\\"The House That Was Alive\\" is clearly inspired from many a Gothic novel... and maybe a taste of a novel to come from the pen of Renée Bagley? This reader certainly hopes so!<br />\\"He is Safe\\" is a sweet tribute to a now-deceased treasure, while \\"Seeker of Light\\" is vivid in its imagery, as is \\"Midnight's Children\\". \\"Alive\\" is interesting because of its structure, while \\"A Portrait\\" has the fascinating vision, \\"The even colours of a scattered rainbow / like spectrums of emotions lying in the snow.\\" And \\"Find Your Dreams\\" is the ultimate in inspirational, motivational poetry, without being condescending.<br />Even the most reluctant poetry reader can find something worthy inside this first collection from a poet who has the wisdom of a woman twice older. One can only look ahead now to the forthcoming second collection, Break the Chain.	2003-05-25
