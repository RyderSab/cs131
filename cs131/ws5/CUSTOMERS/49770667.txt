Although I concur with some of the criticism from some of my fellow reviewers below, and would not claim that its merit lay in either great writing or a fascinating plot, I found it reasonably balanced, thoughtful and stirring. The tale of modern day Afghanistan is not a pretty one, but it is one we need to hear. It is especially poignant when you consider the shift that has taken place there in so short a space of time. Hosseini deals with this aspect of his story effectively. In fact, I could translate the image of Afghanistan's awful political situation to the world stage: we are probably closer to our own Afghanization than we might like to think. <br /> <br />However, the true reason for liking the book, for enjoying it with hardly a hitch all the way through, is for its characterization. The main characters are all highly stereotyped - Assef the bully, Baba the heroic male, Amir the coward - except for Hassan. Hassan is a very fine portrait of what I might call \\"a beautiful soul.\\" This is very hard to achieve - a portrait of a character who is somehow reaching out from within, attempting whether consciously or unconsciously, to touch those around him and be at peace with the world, just as he finds it. If my hunch is right, Hosseini deliberately made the other characters stereotypical in order to highlight this one character. I think he has succeeded and it is very fine writing. There are also other levels working along with the more obvious main story. Who and what is the kite-runner? Is he not an evolving character with his own personality which develops throughout the book. What was Baba's point in going against established thinking and befriending an Hazara family, and \\"pissing on the beards\\" of the mullahs and so on? What was the point of describing Soroya's incursion into pre-marital sex? All of these and many other details seem to combine so that we are always, like the main character in the book, being forced to askquestions. And as in all good writing, the questions we have to answer are not about the book, but about ourselves.	2005-10-14

I don't think I have ever read a book that has offered so much initial frustration, which has ended up turning out quite so well. In the first couple of chapters I was sure I was not going to be able to finish it. I put this down largely to poor editing, but I think there may be the added factor that this edition involved a major revision of an earlier work and that the two were not married very happily together. Yet the book soon strikes out on a new path, and on another level, as we leave the Manx and Cumbrian origins of Fletcher Christian behind, and begin to learn some of the details of that murky event known to history as the \\"Mutiny on the Bounty.\\" One thing is obvious and it is to the author's credit, as he is a direct descendent of Fletcher Christian (and, something which will appear obvious given the nature of life on Pitcairn at the time of the first settlement, of several of the other mutineers): he makes a very bold attempt not to hoist Bligh on too high a yardarm, in spite of the man's obvious and well-established shortcomings. Indeed, he allows Bligh to hang himself in the book, which is something he seems to have tried very hard to accomplish in real life. <br />The book's last section of three concerns the personal odyssey by author Glynn Christian back to Pitcairn in search of traces of Fletcher and a greater understanding of some of the legend which grew up around him and his fellow conspirators of over 200 years ago. It is well done, and if we are a bit frustrated by the results, it's not because the author didn't try hard enough. In fact, this is a very successful project from every point of view, even if I did think at first that it was going to be \\"another island book,\\" like the one on St-Kilda I read many years ago and still haven't digested to this day. Anyone interested in the Bounty story mustread this and all those interested in the history of the Pacific, or even just plain family history, will probably enjoy this very much. After initially wanting to almost burn it, I now find myself giving it my highest recommendation. It's quite unique. By the by, it's interesting to reflect on the book's title. Ordinarily, one would think it referred to Pitcairn, the ancestral home as it were; but I rather fancy it refers to Tahiti instead, that fabled place from which some of Glynn Christian's other ancestors sprang.	2002-10-02

I suppose I'm always on the lookout for new ways of  doing things and new ways of thinking. \\"Compassionate Capitalism\\" provides  some real meat for a hungry world in need of just that - new ideas.  Economics is a complicated field (so I've been told - I'm no expert), yet  Rich de Vos has managed to demystify it, at least as far as this reader is  concerned. His ideas seem to be free of any real political ties or  religious taints (religion doesn't enter into the book at all) - he seems  just to be genuinely interested in people (I wish I couldn't hear the  sneers, but unfortunately I do). I also admire him as an American. Goodness  knows America has the driving force and energy to influence the whole of  this world one way or another, but it doesn't really seem to have the will  (nor, perhaps, the imagination) to do anything really creative (sure they  have introduced fuel efficient motors - a relative concept at the best of  times - but have you seen the size of the 1999 and 2000 models? ). So  learning that there are ideas out there which do not just mean more of the  same, and bigger and meaner (whether from the auto industry or the rest of  the military-industrial complex) is somewhat reassuring. <br />One thing I'm  sure of: every American (those who can read) should digest this book. It  doesn't try to convert. It simply tries (very well) to make sense out of  the current madness.	2000-07-27

Over the years he has published a number of collections of short stories, a genre in which he excels. His  stories are not always macabre, but they invariably have a twist, making  them unforgettable many years later.     Some of them, it is true, may have  you writhing slightly, but even so, you will appreciate the intention, as  well as the finesse. There are so many good writers around, it's hard to  get to them all, but it's worth finding \\"Someone Like You\\" for a  number of reasons. First of all, you might like Dahl, in which case you'll  be set for quite a while (as long as you can find his books). Secondly, he  is a technical wizard (in one of his stories, concerning a wordsmith, he  discusses some of the aspects of the very wizardry he practices) and you  should have a look at that side of him. He should not be out of print - he  deserves better. There's no doubt in my mind that we'll be reading Dahl for  many years to come, if we've got any sense.	2000-07-27

Since then, it has attracted the unbelievable number of soi-disant negative or unhelpful votes of 152 (June 2004)(and now, in November 2007, the count is 10 Useful and only 102 Not Useful - stranger and stranger!). I suppose it is the work of one person, as one scarcely imagines there are so many people out there who would care enough about this particular work (or about this particular writer - me). Nevertheless it is a fascinating statistic and it adds a little more colour to our understanding of a world which is already malfunctioning in numerous other ways.<br /><br />Here's the original review:<br />I guess if Dale Carnegie was writing today, he would be quite a star author, since the subject which he helped to develop has become one of the most popular of all those to be found on bookshop shelves. How surprising  is it then, to consider that Carnegie had such tremendous success in an  epoch where a great many people would have had difficulty just coming to  terms with his ideas, let alone embracing them. It seems simplistic to say  that most of Carnegie's text is just plain common sense: it certainly is  that. His prose is also delivered in an unequivocal fashion, but with  humour. He knows what he's talking about, and he knows probably, that you  or me or the next guy is going to be sceptical anyway. So he just tells it  like he sees it and hopes the reader will catch the vision. Since he really  hasn't got a hobbyhorse to ride, we do catch the drift (at least the  millions of copies sold suggest that we do). I believe if you read this  book and don't have a thoroughly enjoyable time (as you straighten out a  lot of your own thinking), then it will only be because you need to come  back to it in two or perhaps five years time. In addition to the above, let  me say that Carnegie is also a fine writer, which helps.	2000-07-27

Whether the old characters she met in those days are gone or not (they are not all gone -  it's still possible to find some of them out in the mulga), the stories she  tells about them and this extraordinary land are still worth reading,  perhaps more than ever. The Territory is still off the beaten track (except  perhaps for Darwin and Kakadu) and the colour you get from a book written  forty or fifty years ago is still vivid and impressive. At the time she  wrote it (if memory serves me, she was a journalist working in Sydney or  Melbourne, who was taking time off to travel Australia), the outback was  still extremely remote and unknown even to most Australians. She was  criticised by some of the people she wrote about, as having no idea what  the place \\"was really like\\" and for being \\"a Southerner\\" who knew nothing  about the north. Yet I for one, who lived for four years in the Top End,  appreciated her text very much and I think we can be extremely happy today  that she managed to get it published. It will take you back to a world,  much of which is gone forever. Yet if you get the chance to stop a bit in  the north, you'll be surprised what you find, and Hill's book might just  put you on the trail of discovery.<br />Ernestine Hill wrote a number of  books about northern Australia, one other of which I've read. \\"Australian  Frontier\\" is her story of a trip around the coast from Perth to Darwin in  the 40s and it is also well worth reading. In particular she tells some  stories of the pearling days in Broome and Darwin, which are worth having a  look at. I just hope books like these won't remain out of print forever.	2000-07-27

There are a number of writers I have come across who could benefit from having it  handy as well. The 1996 revised and expanded edition is the fruit of a  great deal of experience, as well as practice in the making of this unique  kind of reference tool. At first sight, it's not that easy to find your way  around such a book. However, once you've used it for a month or two, you'll  find that you can go to the right section fairly quickly: it is well set  out. Among the myriad problems that it covers, there's a useful section on  Canadian geographical names and a quick look at French typographical rules.  Whilst you may or may not find this last section of use, it indicates the  degree of thoroughness that the book is attempting. All wordsmiths on the  upper (slightly colder) side of the border should own it.	2000-07-24

His themes may not always appeal to a broad readership, since they are sometimes fairly parochial in nature, giving him a wide claim to being a  genuine &quot;Canadian&quot; author (rather than North-American). However,  he is a truly international writer as well, of a calibre I've not often  encountered. Perhaps his career didn't quite have the impact of Ernest  Hemingway's (with whom he was quite friendly in the thirties) or Graham  Greene's, but the quality of his work puts him very much in their class.  &quot;A Time for Judas&quot; is a good example of this. Callaghan takes us,  in a Gore Vidal-like fashion, back to the time of Christ and recounts a  marvellous tale set in and around Jerusalem. It is not only well-written  and exciting, but as a purported account of the &quot;true&quot; events of  the time (left to be discovered on papyrus centuries later), it falls into  a sort of mystery tradition which is very hard to pull off, from a writing  point of view. With complete confidence, Callaghan tells a tale which will  thrill and perhaps even enlighten you, and have you seeking out more of his  work. Fortunately, there is a relative abundance so find this one if you  can.	2000-07-24

Compton Mackenzie might have been an equally obvious choice - he had  already written one book about Charles Edward Louis Philippe Casimir  Stuart. However, regardless of the choice of author, the style of the text  was somewhat fixed from the start, since it was meant to back up a  documentary film (as a published book) and so was not an individual  writer's earnest appraisal of either the history or the  legend.<br />Nevertheless, settling upon Linklater ensured a certain native  expertise and charm, so to speak, since by the time he wrote this, he was a  very able writer with numerous books to his credit. So &quot;The Prince in  the Heather&quot; followed its predicted path and became a sort of odyssey,  as Linklater and a film crew revisited the major haunts of the Prince  during his lengthy (and often recounted) escape through the islands off  Scotland's west coast. It is not a book that can be read as history so much  as a story of now and then. The author intrudes (somewhat apologetically)  from time to time, in order to periodically give the story a modern angle.  Most of the text is devoted to the doings of 250 years ago, however, and  under the competent pen of this first-rate Scottish writer, the Bonnie  Prince once more comes out from the shadows. It is not an original work,  and I do not think it is mandatory reading for historians. Yet it is a  perfectly good read (a bonnie book shall we say) and if you pick up the  original edition from somewhere, as I did, you'll find it is a well  presented volume complete with a number of pertinent photographs.	2000-07-24

Michael Larsen's suitably thin volume has this and many other qualities, making it a very useful tool for the writer who seriously wishes  to publish. I can't say whether it actually works or not, as I have not yet  sent off a proposal based on this work. However, I have laboriously put  together one proposal (for a book which missed its deadline and has become,  at least for the moment, rather defunct) using this work as a guide. I can  affirm that its wisdom is distilled in sufficiently short order so that it  is possible to find your way about in it all, as you are trying to come to  grips with the finer details (and not forget anything). A larger book  would, in contrast, have you wallowing. In any case, Larsen has built this  text from his own experience: he knows it works and he manages to convey  that sort of confidence to the reader of \\"How to Write a Book Proposal.\\"  Anyone thinking of writing something publishable would do well to get this  beforehand - much of the roadwork can be done on the way and it helps  enormously to know what your chances are, before coughing up 200,000 words  or more on a subject that no-one will publish anyway.<br />To anyone trying to  publish a book in the future, I therefore say: good luck, and you can  increase your chances by reading and understanding this book first.	2000-07-19

Like his contemporary, William Shirer, Leonard Mosley brings  a professional eye to the major events of the period leading up to the  start of the war, and the fact that he was often sur place, gives the book  a most authentic ring. The book raises a number of seemingly minor but  possibly vital questions such as: would Hitler's attitude to Chamberlain  have been different had the British P.M. not turned up in Berchtesgarden  with a staff of only four people? Certainly he began to develop a degree of  contempt for Chamberlain from that meeting onward, and when it came time  for the fateful meeting on the Rhine some months later, Hitler was openly  contemptuous of the British P.M. <br />Would things have also been different  had the Czechoslovakian President, Eduard Benes, had more sleep just prior  to the events of September 1938? Would he have seen things more clearly and  called in the Russians, as he probably should have done (and, it is  believed, nearly did do)? And would it not have been much more favourable  for the British and French to fight Germany with Czechoslovakia in 1938,  than without her in 1939? Mosley is very good at asking these sorts of  questions, which, so many years later, may prove to have been very decisive  indeed.<br />How many odd events seemed to influence the mood of the leaders  of that time. How many messages failed to get through to the right place.  Sometimes they were inexplicably held up en route (Mosley suggests it may  have been due, on occasions, to Communist spies in the British Secret  Service - like Donald McLean). At other times, well placed people (like  Paul Stehlin, the French Air Attaché in Berlin), tried to warn their  governments repeatedly that things were hotting up, but were not taken  seriously. As for the extraordinary series of errors committed by the  Anglo-French military and political delegations to Moscow just prior to the  invasion of Poland, Mosley covers them in detail and highlights many points  hitherto overlooked. <br />These and many other forgotten issues probably  exerted a far greater influence at the time than has been thought since.  Yet in the end, it was the personality of Adolf Hitler himself, although  set off and to some extent complemented in exactly the wrong way by the  French and British leaders of the period (and one might add, the Italian),  which proved decisive. From the very start, it was undoubtedly Hitler's  war, and Mosley brings this historical imperative more firmly into the  light of day than ever. It nevertheless leaves one quite breathless, to see  in detail how it all came about.	2000-07-17
US	49770667	R263SB7P5EJKIF	0345308239	162225088	The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam	Books	3	34	47	N	N	Not up to the usual standard	Barbara Tuchman is a first-rate writer and historian whose books I have much enjoyed. For some years now I have been meaning to get a copy of \\"The March of Folly,\\" since it is a book which greatly appeals to me in its  concept. To look at the history of modern man (since about 1,000 BC) and  take examples of real foolishness on the part of a number of key  governments, and try to see why they so acted, strikes me as a wonderful  idea for a book. However, I can now say, somewhat reluctantly, that \\"The  March of Folly\\" is not up to the standard of Tuchman's earlier books. I  find this curious indeed and have been wondering for some time why it is  so.<br />Firstly, the writing is not up to par and I can only put this down to  sloppy editing. Some of the oddest phrases in the book are so un-Tuchman  like, that I imagine they have been written by a researcher and, for  whatever reason, have managed to sneak by both the author and her editors.  Tuchman is usually crisp and succinct. Some of this text is laborious and  redundant; it's most surprising. Perhaps this first fault leads to the  second, although not entirely. In \\"The Guns of August\\" and \\"The Proud  Tower,\\" Tuchman seems to be in very complete command of both her history  and her sources. In \\"The March of Folly,\\" one begins to wonder if she has  not strayed too far afield and is rather unsure of her ground. So it  appears to me, especially with reference to the beginning of the book,  where she discusses both the siege of Troy and then the Papacy during the  Renaissance, when she seems very shaky indeed. Or it may be that this  apparent instability is founded on limited research and that that has been  allowed to come through in the book. Whatever the reason, I find that the  book does not live up to its promise, either conceptually or authorially.  <br />The sections on the American Revolution and the Vietnam War are  interesting in themselves, but one wonders at times, given the detail  involved in both cases,if Tuchman is not actually off the rails. The fact  that there is no stated plan at the beginning of the book (chapters and  sub-headings and synopses, I mean) makes me wonder indeed, just how much of  a plan she had. So I think you can read this book for its individual  content (i.e., if you happen to be interested in the particular periods  covered), but the disappointment overall is that the really first-rate text  that one might have expected, does not materialise. I will say that the  essay at the end is very Tuchmanesque and is a brave attempt, quand même,  to tie the threads of the book together. Yet I'm unsure of just how far she  can get away with a text that smacks so readily of invention and  understudy, and in my opinion, the epilogue is hardly sufficient, by  itself, to save the whole. I suppose it is just possible that she and I  both got carried away by the title.	2000-06-30

It's one of those situations in which you thank the Lord, or somebody, that this particular person decided to go ahead in this particular direction. I don't know if  just anyone will enjoy &quot;The Proud Tower,&quot; since it deals with a  very precise period in history, the Victorian Age in Britain, or the time  leading up to the First World War. However, for me Tuchman's book, while  not actually revelatory (her book on the origins of W. W. I - &quot;The  Guns of August&quot; - definitely was), proved well worth reading. She  tends to deal a lot in anecdotes, making you wonder if some of the remarks  she attributes to others have been taken out of context. But if this is a  weakness, it also lends strength to the book by making it eminently  readable. The period of world and particularly European history leading up  to those August guns is endlessly interesting, since here was a world which  in many ways, was closer to that of the 10th century, than the 20th.  Aristocracy was fading, labour movements were slowly but surely making  themselves felt, and the lights were, as we now know, slowly going out all  over Europe. If you haven't read Tuchman yet, you are missing a very  serious investigator who has the added charm of authorial integrity, but  doesn't ram anything down your throat. It's intelligent, often  perspicacious writing, which really freshens up our notions of what a  history book should be.	2000-06-20

After the war he returned to the North, and began a career as an author which has continued for half a century. At the same time, he developed a deep  attachment to the Canadian wilderness which has led him on a long and  extraordinary voyage of personal discovery. In the late fifties, after a  decade of Arctic activity, Mowat conceived the idea of writing a history of  the major explorations which had taken place there. His purpose was  twofold: firstly, there was no other complete history available, although a  great deal of excellent material lay hidden away in out-of-print books and  the dusty corners of libraries.  Secondly, he wanted to pay a tribute to  the men who first went into those sometimes inhospitable lands and as he  says, \\"...demonstrate the magnitude and grandeur of human endeavour in that  hard environment.\\"<br />\\"Ordeal by Ice\\" is the first of the three books in  the \\"Top of the World\\" series. It tells of a number of early expeditions to  the frozen north, starting with Henry Hudson's early 17th century voyage,  which ended in tragedy and mystery. Indeed, tragedy of the most appalling  kind awaited many of those who attempted to make their way through the  \\"Icie Seas,\\" and it is the attempt to progress against the fantastic odds  of the northern winter which makes the stories Mowat has collected so  compelling. This is invigorating history, of a kind which Mowat has made  his own (see also \\"Sea of Slaughter,\\" \\"People of the Deer,\\" \\"The Desperate  People\\" etc.). Not only has he done us a great service by bringing it out  of its mothballs, so to speak, but he has also created a vital and highly  readable saga of northern exploration that can be read for its own sake.	2000-06-14

In this formidable historical series, Mowat retraces the steps of the early explorers into Canada's northern realms. Volume one,  \\"Ordeal by Ice\\" told us of some of the earliest expeditions into Hudson's  Bay and of the difficulties faced by inexperienced men in ill-equipped  ships. Indeed, those who set out were frequently never heard from again and  their stories have been pieced together, often many years later, by the  discovery of diaries under rocky cairns and from information gleaned from  Eskimos who came across the men at some stage during their struggles. The  stories are quite fantastic and there is an atmosphere of outlandish  adventure throughout these books, making them difficult to put down. Volume  two, \\"The Polar Passion,\\" recounts the fascination exerted by the idea of  reaching the North Pole, and the results of some of the early expeditions.  Drawing from primary sources, Mowat lets the expedition members tell the  story themselves, as much as possible. He contents himself with drawing  them all together and setting them against an historical background that  allows us to have a wider perspective of the events. It has obviously been  a long labour of love for Mowat and I feel as though a considerable debt is  owing to him, for having made this material available to us in such a  readable and coherent form.	2000-06-12

In what soon proved to be a run of bad luck, one of the largest of the sea mammals, a  Fin whale, found itself trapped in a huge body of water near the town of  Burgeo. It had managed to just slide over a rocky underwater escarpment and  get into the bay, but try as it might it could not get out again.<br />Farley  Mowat's part in the story is rather extraordinary and I won't go into it in  detail here, for fear of spoiling it. Suffice it to say that he becomes, as  far as such a thing is possible, the trapped whale's guardian and  broadcasts the story of its plight throughout the world. His relationship  with the mammal develops in conjunction with his relationship with the  townspeople of Burgeo and the local and provincial authorities. I would not  like to call this a thrilling story, because that seems hardly appropriate,  but it is a dramatic one whichever way you look at it. In the process of  attempting to rescue the whale, Mowat (and now, through the book, us)  learns a great deal more about human nature than he might have imagined he  would, beforehand.<br />Farley Mowat has written innumerable books about  wildlife, the environment and the Canadian wilderness in general. This is a  book he scarcely planned to write but he brings to it all the skills of the  writer who has practised his art over many years. It is a first-rate story  about living on Earth in the twentieth century, and it should be widely  read for the message it contains about the frailty of all existence.	2000-05-31

Although many of his best books are almost unplanned, coming to fruition after some sort of initial spontaneous  combustion (I'm thinking of \\"People of the Deer\\" especially), the fictional  elements in \\"The Snow Walker\\" indicate a methodical mind capable of forming  well crafted prose. All these stories take place in the Arctic, or have to  do with it. Many are based on people Mowat met on his travels or heard  about from others. They contain the grains of ideas and don't attempt to do  more than expand that one notion, as I think short stories should. Hence  the stories are focussed and the issue at hand is brought into sharp  relief, sometimes in only a few pages. Like a number of Mowat's works, this  one has been used in schools for many years, and deservedly so, as it is  some of the best Canadian short fiction of its kind (i.e., about the  Arctic).	2000-05-31

Yet Mowat is just as fun-loving as the next person and it comes out in this collection of stories about his  youth in Ontario and Manitoba. Mutt, the dog of the book's title, is a dog  who very reasonably refuses to act like one. So he won't hunt ducks  properly or do much else that is reckoned too dog-like, at least while  anyone's watching. Mutt was Mowat's constant companion throughout many  boyhood forays into the wild country around wherever he happened to be  living. On the prairies in the 1920s and 30s, he says, it was easy to get  out in the bush, because it started right where the town stopped. You just  had to walk out. So began Farley Mowat's lifelong love of the natural  world. Indeed, he made a pretty good naturalist by the age of ten and  earned himself a minor living for a time, through the dubious activity of  collecting birds' eggs. This is an easy book to get along with and one that  would probably be enjoyed by children. Indeed, I assume it may well have  been intended for Mowat's own children. I thoroughly recommend it.	2000-05-31

Farley Mowat is not well known as a sailor perhaps, but as someone who has skippered his way along the Newfoundland coast and  survived, he must be reasonably authentic. Like many inland-born Canadians,  Mowat had not sailed a small boat at sea before arriving in Newfoundland  after the war. However, he had done a lot of sailing on Lake Superior in  his boyhood and youth, on a yacht his father owned and sailed for many  years. And sailing appears to have been in his blood.<br />The tale of how he  acquires this particular boat, then sails along the coast for the summer  and finally brings it up the St-Lawrence Seaway all the way to Montreal,  will please any lover of maritime fare. Among his many books, Mowat wrote a  number of autobiographical ones, some of which are lighter in tone. \\"The  Boat Who Wouldn't Float\\" is delightfully easy to read and, along with \\"The  Dog Who Wouldn't Be\\"(the story of Mowat's childhood), gives interesting  insights into the life of one of Canada's foremost writers.	2000-05-31

His love of detail and the pains he goes to make sure of what he is stating are characteristics that I enjoy in his texts.  Sometimes, he goes to an almost ridiculous extent to flesh out the reality  of his background, when it probably would not be missed. Yet just as he  does this, you can see him entering a truly fictional world in which,  whoops, his characters suddenly do resemble real people and his narrative  suddenly comes to life. It might be the extra effort Donald Ross goes to  get the wireless to work, something banal and silly like that, but we know,  almost without realising it that Shute is suddenly expanding a fictional  context to include the all too likely possibility of future danger, and we  realise just how much care is being taken. The work is not sloppy; it is  methodical and I admit, at times a little dry. Yet when Shute's work really  fires, it is because of this attention to the right kind of detail.<br />\\"An  Old Captivity\\" has long been one of my favourite Shute novels. In a way  it's an experimental sort of book: it takes the long wide arc of a journey  from Britain to Canada via Iceland and Greenland, as its background. The  path of a small seaplane is traced with infinite pains to capture the  solitariness and the arduous nature of the voyage. Its three passengers are  linked together in interesting and diverse ways. Slowly, against the  further background of the Icelandic sagas, the tale emerges and, as usual  with Nevil Shute, it is not what we are expecting. Just when the clean,  crisp, almost mechanical prose has us thinking one thing, Shute leaps off  into a void composed of history and imagination. It's an extremely  disciplined piece of writing and I hope you'll enjoy the ride.	2000-05-30

But that all lies in the misty past, and Keneally has done a  first-rate job of bringing much of this truculent history out into the  light. <br />This is an epic journey, just as the formation of the Irish  diaspora needs it to be. You never quite know where you are you going to go  next, as ships sail back and forth from Ireland to Australia and from  Australia to the Americas. It is the roaring days of sail just before  steam, and gold is being discovered right and left on both sides of the  Pacific, sufficient to lend impetus to various Fenian schemes through  goldfields' fundraising. <br />One of the characters involved in the 50s was a  man destined to become an American Civil War hero with the rank of general.  He fought on the Union side while another Irishman who had fought the same  battle as he had at home in Ireland, and had also been transported for it,  fought with the Confederates. Such were the fortunes of war at that time.  <br />The book also recounts how the Fenian forces tried on three occasions,  prior to Confederation, to invade Canada in order to hurt the British in  North America. They also had the long-term plan of mounting an invasion of  Ireland from a Canadian base. It was all a bit pathetic in the end, but for  a time, it was in deadly earnest and who could have said what the result  might not have been had the Fenian forces succeeded.<br />Perhaps the most  interesting part of a very entertaining book is the retelling of an  attempted rescue from Western Australia of the last group of Fenian  \\"lifers,\\" all soldiers who had been cashiered from the British Armyfor  their part in Fenian plots in England and Ireland. These men had little  hope of ever leaving their prison, and were mostly ailing by the time  American Fenians had raised the enormous sum needed to buy a ship to go to  their rescue. The hair-raising tale of what happened is one of the  nineteenth century's best adventure stories, and Keneally relishes the  telling of it.<br />So this is a book which has everything an Irishman, or an  Irishman at heart, could wish for. I wonder what the reaction of the  English might be to such a tale. The evidence is somewhat damning, to the  effect that political repression of the most odious kind was used during  and after the famine. Of course, this is only referring to the nineteenth  century and does not go back in any detail to the awful story of Cromwell's  men or even earlier, which might lead one to think that the English, when  they came to Ireland, only did so to practice. <br />If you've got any Irish  blood in you, (and if you didn't previously know one way or the other, this  may prove to be a glorious occasion for finding out) you'll fairly quickly  be learning to say the old war cry, Erin go bragh. Ireland forever! It's a  strange tale and one that should make us reflect about the nature of power  and its misuse. It all seems so long ago now but that's just a mirage of  sorts, for it was really only just the other day. <br />Lastly I should point  out that writing a book like this must have been a sheer delight. Keneally  seems to have visited many of the sites he talks about and they are often  in out of the way places. I imagine that it was an absolute pleasure for  him to write a book like this and I look forward to the day when he finds  time to do it again. I can't recommend \\"The Great Shame\\" highly enough.	2000-05-27

In the latter part of 1988, he saw his last and perhaps most accomplished work brought to bed at his publishers in New York. The author of many highly controversial works of fiction and  non-fiction, best known for his seemingly solitary stand against the  ecological destruction of the western American deserts, Abbey's last book  effectively completed a cycle. At the same time it was a very close  foretelling of his own probable doom.<br />Abbey was an environmentalist from  the beginning. In the East of his youth, he saw strip mines close in on his  father's mountain acres. Out West, he witnessed the early preparations  being made to dam the Colorado and its tributaries. He rafted down Glen  Canyon and saw the hidden valleys filled with a beauty that was soon after  to be engulfed. He smelt out the tricky political deals being woven by  senators and landowners in the forgotten tracts of the butte country and  did his best to expose them. Against all of the attempts to tame this  corner of the American wilderness, Abbey railed. <br />In books ranging from  \\"Desert Solitaire\\" (1967), a journal of a season in the desert, to \\"The  Monkey Wrench Gang\\" (1975), an explosive novel of saboteurs versus  dambuilders, Abbey argues his points in favour of preserving the canyon  country. Having been there \\"before\\" and \\"after,\\" his voice has a compelling  authority. To read his account of Glen Canyon before the dam is to be  filled with regret at the later spoliation. <br />In \\"The Fool's Progress,\\"  Abbey gives us something of a summing up of his own life. The book is like  a reverse history of Kerouac's \\"On the Road.\\" Instead of youth rushing out  through the length of America to meet its new and cosmic identity on the  West Coast, here is a life which is wearing down, attacked from within,  going back from the desert to the Appalachian hills of birth and ancestry.  In the chronicle of the winding down, as the truck begins to fail and a  mortal pain begins to rise, boyhood is measured against the actual  experience of the now hard-bitten adult. <br />\\"The Fool's Progress\\" is the  work of a now accomplished writer in his prime. We might have expected much  more from Edward Abbey and his early death is a great loss. Nevertheless,  his completed works stand on their own and I can recommend them to anyone  who is intrigued by the workings of an original mind as it tackles the  problems of our age.	2000-05-25

I read it very quickly and thoroughly enjoyed it and was even a little peeved that I hadn't  thought of it myself. (Fancy missing the opportunity of a book with a title  like that!) There are a number of similar walks one can do, especially in  Britain; I'm thinking of the walk along Hadrian's Wall in particular. Yet  the notion of walking the old trench-lined area and no-man's land of  Flanders is a terrific one. What an education! Fortunately for the reader,  O'Shea has a competent writing hand as well, and I enjoyed the ramble he  took me on. <br />O'Shea takes risks which, as far as this reader is  concerned, nearly always come off. I was confident enough, reading the  prose, to be willing to skip over any minor problems. Certainly there are  no gaping wounds and nothing requiring major surgery. It seems to me I have  read writing similar to this, which attempts to cut a swathe (and a  swagger) through the language, while mistaking a pair of rather blunt  pruning shears for a well-sharpened scythe. I congratulate this author on  his use of the stone.<br />I can't say that it's much of a book when it comes  to the war itself, but O'Shea never pretends it to be otherwise than a view  at field level of what's left. If he gets a bit cross at times about some  of the former silliness that took place there, who can blame him. I believe  this is a first effort by the author and in that case, for my money, it's  worth every one of those five available stars. I'd be very proud to have  written this.	2000-05-24

Lethbridge is the author of numerous books, ranging from pre-history and archaeology to witchcraft and I suppose what we could call the paranormal. I first came across his work in the writings of Colin Wilson  (an English author who introduced me to many obscure writings such as  these), in connection with the paranormal, and I managed to find a copy of  \\"The Essential T. C. Lethbridge\\" over time. I think this book, which was  released posthumously as a sort of tribute to the writer, is an interesting  indication of the man's depth, which was considerable, yet the original  works are far more interesting still.<br />Two of my favourites are \\"Herdsmen  and Hermits\\" and \\"The Painted Men\\" and for anyone interested in the  pre-history of the British Isles, up until the Viking age in about 1000 AD,  they are wonderful reading. Lethbridge was recognised as an archaeologist  but he always had the most difficult time getting on with the  establishment, since he refused to tow the line on accepted history.  Therefore he was always working somewhat on his own, without the support of  a major institution and its a wonder he managed to make his way as he did,  and publish so much.<br />The other Lethbridge connection which has been of  interest to me, is with the Canadian writer Farley Mowat. Although they  never met, they were contemporaries and one wonders what the result might  have been had they worked on projects jointly. In any case, Mowat  eventually discovered Lethbridge's writing and found support for some of  his own rather contentious theories about the maritime movements of peoples  in northern Britain toward the Americas, before the Viking age. Mowat's  book on the subject, \\"The Farfarers,\\" in which he draws on Lethbridge's  \\"Herdsmen and Hermits,\\" is one of the most interesting books about early  North American exploration I've come across. However, there is no doubt  that the scientific community views both writers as being outside the pale.<br />All that is to say that Lethbridge is well worth finding. He reads very  well today, although his subject matter is naturally specialised and it is  not, I suppose for the general reader. One hopes one day that the important  works of writers like T. C. Lethbridge will be brought back into print. In  the meantime, good hunting.at is to say that Lethbridge is well worth finding.

With very little attempt at disguise, it tells the story of an Australian mobster who ruled a network of criminal activity for several decades before  the Second World War. It is a brutal story and one that somehow touches on  an aspect of Australian history which is hardly ever expressed in print.  European Australia has always been a hard land. With communities originally  based on convict labour, it seems as though a certain amount of violence  came to be taken almost for granted. In a country that long had an  oversupply of men, it is perhaps not so surprising that they spent much of  their time trying to dominate both the land, its original inhabitants and  each other. A sometimes brutal Army Corps looked after convicts for the  first fifty years or so. Later, law enforcement was taken over by a police  force which has often had to face charges of similar brutality and  deep-rooted corruption, up to the present day. Aussie politics has always  had a particularly nasty underbelly, and it seems as though social  conditions were ripe in the 1920s for the rise of just such a personage as  is depicted here.<br />Frank Hardy had to fight (the mob) hard to get this  novel published and once he had succeeded, he had to go to court to defend  it against a defamation order. The book's main character, even though he  tried hard in later life to attain a position of legitimacy, always found  himself caught up in the web of underworld intrigue that he had created.  Even so, it is probably true to say that most ordinary people didn't want  to know about the activities imputed to a man who was, superficially, a  pillar of the community. So Hardy was right to expose the ruthless nature  of the beast underlying the ostensibly honest sports promoter and family  man. And perhaps all Australia, or those who remember this particular  episode (and its ongoing media life through film and television) did well  to note what sort of man lay behind the mask. <br />Australia has taken a long  time to come out of this period of its history, when personal might could  be displayed almost with impunity, even in public affairs. This book,  perhaps neglected today, serves to remind us of the imposing structure of  organised crime that Australia has had to grow up with. In addition, it is  a fine literary achievement and worthy of being read on that basis alone.	2000-05-24

Lillian Beckwith's real strength lies in being able to  recreate the atmosphere of those unique island environments on paper. Like  an artist working away with a fairly stiff brush, she paints the people,  architecture and wildlife of this Scottish island (to which, she claims,  she was only going for a holiday), with firmness and purpose. One wonders  how long the holiday really lasted and one suspects a lifetime. These are  indeed places to fall in love with: cut off from mainland life to the  extent that, even today, forty years after the publication of \\"The Sea for  Breakfast,\\" one can still find a world that is not subjected to the strains  and odours of our industrial society.

By stages, he managed to go  right up into latter day Nunavut, some of the highest inhabited Arctic  territory in Canada's north. Yet he didn't stop there. Putting himself into  the hands of an Eskimo hunter who happened to be heading off onto the sea  ice, he underwent an extraordinary odyssey lasting the winter through, in  which he camped with the Eskimos in their winter igloos. <br />de Poncins  takes us into the very private, very communal world of these northern  people. Private because, for Europeans, entering this strangely illuminated  landscape was even then almost an impossibility. de Poncins admits that his  initial impression was overshadowed by the nausea which sprang immediately  into being as he tried to deal with the strange mixture of smells in the  igloos. Most Europeans would not pass that first test and many an estimate  of Eskimo culture has been biased by just such an affront to a sensitive  olfactory centre. Yet once he had passed this initial barrier, a process  which he says took some time, he found himself in a world unlike any other  he had experienced or imagined. It is into this ageless community that he  takes us for a very privileged glimpse of the last of the true  ice-dwellers. <br />Although a French national, de Poncins chose to remain in  North America and he wrote his text about the Inuit in English, in  collaboration with a friend. Not much is known about the author's life  thereafter, as he did not publish much other work, but like G. B. Edwards's  solitary yet wonderful book about life on Guernsey, \\"The Book of Ebenezer  Le Page,\\" this one book by de Poncins is a major accomplishment.	2000-05-24

First published in 1941, not long after America's entry into the war, it acted as a crucial means of informing the American public of the  state of affairs in Germany up until the start of the war. Shirer spent the  years from 1934 to 1940 in Europe as a foreign correspondent, and was  mostly posted in Berlin during that time. As such, he witnessed the rise of  Nazi fanaticism from a privileged position, often being given access to  Nazi functions that the public could not attend. Shirer's better known  work, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" is more exhaustive and  examines the subject from a slightly more detached point of view. \\"Berlin  Diary\\" is the pithy, day-by-day account of what it was really like on the  ground in Berlin, including all the personal difficulties and aggravations  that occurred as the end of 1940 approached.

At  the same time, this may be an opportunity for some people to discover  Morley Callaghan, who is a very fine writer in his own right. His life ran  parallel to Hemingway's for some time, as they met in Toronto and later in  Paris and remained friends thereafter, even if they saw each other only  rarely. In a sense, he is just the person to give us a penetrating look  behind the legends that were being created in the caf&eacute;s and bars of the  ville lumi&egrave;re at the end of the thirties. This is a delightful book as  well; Callaghan is nobody's fool, which means he's not writing for the  mundane reasons that might otherwise be expected, and you can trust him. He  is painting a portrait of a world teetering on the very brink (it is the  summer of 1929), and in his own artful way, he has succeeded in giving us a  rare glimpse into the ill-lit streets and nightclubs just before it all  fades away into the decade of hopelessness that followed.

The book is like  a reverse history of Kerouac's \\"On the Road.\\" Instead of youth rushing out  through the length of America to meet its new and cosmic identity on the  West Coast, here is a life which is wearing down, attacked from within,  going back from the desert to the Appalachian hills of birth and ancestry.  In the chronicle of the winding down, as the truck begins to fail and a  mortal pain begins to rise, boyhood is measured against the actual  experience of the now hard-bitten adult. <br />\\"The Fool's Progress\\" is the  work of a now accomplished writer in his prime. We might have expected much  more from Edward Abbey and his early death is a great loss. Nevertheless,  his completed works stand on their own and I can recommend them to anyone  who is intrigued by the workings of an original mind as it tackles the  problems of our age.	2000-05-16

Yet \\"The Book of Ebenezer Le Page\\" continues to enjoy a sort of  charmed life and I'm very glad of it. The story unfolds on the island of  Guernsey, in the Channel between Britain and France. Its character are  therefore subjected to the influences of both countries, giving rise to  such quaint observations as, \\"in 1066, when we (the Guernseymen) conquered  Great Britain....\\" The island's patois is used throughout the book and there  is a sense of locality which can only be gained (apart from having lived  there) by those intimate with the small change of French argot.<br />Some  marvellous things about this first and only novel include the voice of the  narrator and the obscure life of its author. A Guernseyman who left the  island to live in England, G. B. Edwards remained unknown in literature  despite having earned a small income from play writing for many years.  During his years outside Guernsey, he lived in a series of small English  seaside towns, finishing in Weymouth where he died. Weymouth is the nearest  place one can be to Guernsey on the English mainland. Some great sadness  kept him from returning to his homeland but scarcely ever, it seems, from  thinking about it. Such is the quality of the narrative voice in the novel,  which contains always a trace of lament. <br />Yet it is very much a joyful  book, in a typically dour, island sort of way. It is essentially a  celebration of life and we, removed from the times by fifty to a hundred  years, are given a privileged view of a corner of the world we would hardly  expect to know at first hand. In any case, it is a world now passed. In his  1981 introduction to the book, John Fowles remarks, \\"There may have been  stranger recent literary events, but I rather doubt it.\\" It is just this  oddness which makes me suspect that the book will one day slip into the  mist. In the meantime, while it continues to be published, I can only  recommend that readers continue to pay the small price for this unique yet  hardly provincial masterpiece.	2000-05-16

Part of his personal tragedy was to suddenly discover, not long after the fall of Berlin but before the bombs fell on Hiroshima and  Nagasaki, that he was no longer wanted by the British electorate. That is  how \\"Triumph and Tragedy\\" ends, with a personal note of sourness, although  with little explanation as to the why and wherefore of his own political  demise. The truth lay perhaps in the real nature of the man. Recognised as  the bulldog who could do a lot more than bark in a War Cabinet, he was  called for at once when it was clear that Britain was in danger. Yet so  well-known were his qualities as a fighter of men that, once peace was  about to return, he was despatched back to political oblivion as being  obviously the wrong man to continue. Such is democracy. I've no doubt he  felt a little twinge, as many a soldier at the front also paradoxically  felt, that his war was over. <br />Churchill was probably without equal during  his own lifetime and, by the curious twists of fate which manage men, was  one of the most extraordinary players on the world stage, throughout  recorded history. The last sentence in the book nevertheless shows the true  heart of a man who, whatever else may be said about him, gave so  much:<br />\\"It only remains for me to express to the British people, for whom  I have acted in these perilous years, my profound gratitude for the  unflinching, unswerving support which they have given me during my task,  and for the many expressions of kindness which they have shown towards  their servant.\\"	2000-05-15

Many a retired politician has written his personal memoirs-few  of them have ever done so quite as completely. In the war, Churchill used  secretaries to help him cover the multitude of daily tasks he needed to get  through and afterwards, when living at Chartwell, his home in Kent, he kept  up the practise of using an amanuensis instead of writing himself. This  allowed him to get far more work done, since he could literally do it with  his eyes closed. Nevertheless, we may feel sure that the text is his own.  Proud man that he surely was, there is little chance that he indulged  anyone in much editing. When we see his virtually unedited copy sent from  the field from India, the Sudan and South Africa at the end of the last  century, we can feel sure that by the 1950s, he was a competent composer of  text indeed. <br />\\"Closing the Ring\\" is the story of the climax of the Second  World War. Although he refused to admit it, Hitler probably knew deep down  what everybody else could see very clearly after Stalingrad. The once  mighty armies of the Third Reich were being forced to withdraw; some of the  best divisions had by then been so savaged that little remained. Berlin was  being mercilessly ground down to rubble by legions of British and American  heavy bombers that ended up attacking their targets almost unopposed. It  was the time when madness reigned in the Fuhrerbunker and when the Allies  could see the fruit of their careful planning starting to ripen. Churchill  was at once rewarded by the knowledge that he had been right in thinking  America invincible, and at the same time he was sadly aware that an era was  passing and the British Empire was fading away in front of his eyes.  <br />This is a long sustained narrative, written by a man in full command of  his enormous personal resources. In addition, Churchill had access to a  vast quantity of documentation concerning the period, because he had  written much of that too! Frankly, this is an admirable work of history,  told with a writer's gift for spinning a yarn and I enjoyed every word of  it.	2000-05-15

In a long life, during which he was often preoccupied by both family matters (he had four children) and matters  of state, he nevertheless found the time to compose an inordinate number of  books. I say compose, because he perfected a system during the first war,  which revealed its efficacy more than ever in the second, of working  through secretaries. There are many odd anecdotes told about Churchill, not  the least of which is that his secretaries, sometimes working in rotation  throughout much of the night, were obliged to attend to him and take down  what he said, even in the bath. This way of getting the material down in  print proved to be very effective, as the tens of thousands of published  pages of his work amply demonstrates. <br />His long history of the Second  World War continues with \\"The Hinge of Fate.\\" Although he was personally  assured that the American entry into the war meant the ultimate defeat of  Germany, he still had to see to the day to day running of the war machine,  and counter the perverse effects of both German victories and British  pessimism. Now began, as well, the long battle with Stalin about opening up  a second front in France, to take some of the heat off the Russian armies  in the East. In fact, his relationship with the Russian leader is one of  the most interesting sources of anecdotal references throughout this  series. <br />This is history being well told by a man who was, while perhaps  not a trained historian as such, so steeped in the history of his family  and his country, that he an utterly unique point of view. The fact that he  was also a central figure in the war itself, means that we have, if you  like, a one in a million chance victory on our hands, as though we had just  won a lottery of sorts, by being able to read him.	2000-05-15
US	49770667	RY0QTQDCSV4EJ	0395075378	243604121	001: The Gathering Storm	Books	5	36	38	N	N	Don�t forget that Churchill could write, as well	Winston Churchill may slowly be being forgotten as one of the twentieth century's most prolific writers. Those who learn about him today, if they hear his name at all, usually discover that he was a British Prime  Minister, and little more. Even the fact that it was he who put the War  Cabinet together in 1940, which managed to hold out both strategically and  psychologically against Hitler, is slowly fading. \\"We will fight them on  the beaches...\\" is slowly becoming merged with the sounds of popular music,  and the original sense being lost. Whether that is a good thing or not, I  hardly know. Yet there was so much more to this long-lived British soldier,  journalist, novelist, parliamentarian, artist, statesman and historian,  than mere good generalship.<br />In \\"The Gathering Storm,\\" we are evidently  preparing for the disaster of 1939. Churchill was not in office during  those years, and indeed, although it is probably becoming a more obscure  fact than ever as time goes on, he was something of a political pariah. The  trend of British politics in the thirties, and to some extent within the  influential part of British society, was toward pacifism and a consequent  reduction in armaments and defence expenditure. Churchill was on the  outside, voicing his concern from time to time as a private Member of  Parliament, but unable to make himself heard. So this is the background to  the book, a time of political intrigue at the international level, and of  unwillingness to face up to the facts of the rise of fascism, in Britain.  Perhaps it may be said, in fairness, that until Czechoslovakia turned ugly,  war with Germany was not to be thought of, for all sorts of reasons. The  decisions that were perhaps ill made in those dying days at the end of the  30s, were nevertheless of the tallest order. <br />It is perhaps true that  Churchill is unable to give us a completely unbiased version of events.  However, in the main he sticks to history and what is coloured in thetext  is probably what is left out rather than anything reported as fact. One of  the interesting snippets in the book (and of course, there are many), is  the fact that Churchill, while still out of office, was invited to meet  Hitler in the Rhineland in 1937, declined to do so, and subsequently never  met him at all. His son Randolph, on the other hand, did meet him in Berlin  in the 30s.<br />This is history, first and foremost, and as it intends to  cover the war and not just Churchill's part in it, it strays into all sorts  of odd corners of international foreign policy. Yet none of it is tedious  in the hands of such a gifted writer, and when it becomes a question of the  central facts touching upon the lives of so many millions, this point of  view is a critical one indeed.	2000-05-15

Fortunately for us he does not read as such. There is very little archaic about the expressions he uses or the grammar he  employs, in volume after volume after volume. It remains immensely  readable, and this is the strength of a good writer, it seems to me. As a  boy, Churchill was held up to me as an example of a person with a very full  command of English. I was told, although I have never been able to verify  it, that Churchill employed one of the largest vocabularies of any  individual writing in English. It is ironic to think that, although the use  of English is becoming ever more widespread, it is not generally being put  to anything like the kind of use a man like Churchill made of it. <br />\\"The  Grand Alliance\\" takes us to the point in the Second World War when the  Americans finally declared their intentions. In a sense, it announced the  end to hesitation, the end to British doubts about whether they could  possibly win out against Hitler alone. Of course, America had participated  in the war to a very large extent already, having agreed to set up the  famous \\"Lend-Lease\\" program, whereby first Britain, and later Russia, were  given material support in a way which satisfied the neutral and  isolationist U.S. congress. It was also something of a victory for  Churchill at the same time, since he had worked doggedly at bringing the  Americans around, and although Pearl harbour did tip the balance, it was  partly due to Churchill having prepared the ground. <br />Churchill himself  states that, from the moment of the U.S. entry into the conflict, no matter  how long it might take, he was certain of victory. From his point of view  at the top, he could see that the sheer weight of numbers (tonnage,  armament production etc.,), added to the geographical reality of Germany,  meant they could never hope to win against the combined industrial might of  Britain and theU.S. It was this absolute faith which sustained him during  the reverses of 1941 and 1942.	2000-05-15

The effect was immediate. Although it took me over a year to read  all of it, that was only because I have long had the habit of reading a  number of books concurrently. I simply couldn't put Churchill down. To say  that the story of World War II is a gripping one, is to put it mildly. How  much more gripping do you think it might be in the hands of that one unique  individual who was both one of the central players and the recorder of the  events themselves. At times, I found myself actually wanting certain  historical events to go in favour of the Allies although, naturally, I  already knew the outcome! Such is the effect of Churchill's writing.<br />In  the second volume \\"Their Finest Hour,\\" Britain was holding the fort against  Hitler alone. After Dunkirk, spirits were low all over the place and the  value of Dr Goebells's secret weapon was able to come into play with great  effect. One can imagine the feeling of the citizenry of Britain at that  time, trapped as they felt themselves to be in that little island, with an  unbeaten army just across the channel snarling at them. The whys and  wherefores of the actions of both Hitler and the German General Staff at  that time, can be discussed until you are blue in the face. The fact is  that, although most people on both sides of the Atlantic thought they were  about to hop across and finish the job, the Germans hesitated, mainly for  lack of a plan, and lost the chance. I don't know for sure if Churchill  also thought the British might have been defeated in July, August or  September of 1940, but from the end of that odd period of stalemate, he  never looked back. <br />This is fine writing by a, dare I say, highly  experienced writer who was right in the thick of things almost from the  word go. What a stroke of luck it was that Churchill, like Caesar but  unlikeNapoleon, both lived it and wrote it.	2000-05-15

This is the classic volume on the art of walking (well, not really the art: Hillaby thought it was a natural function). For those who cannot remember the last time they walked to a corner store, the prospect of  actually walking the length of England (not one of the world's longer  islands!) may be somewhat daunting. So sit back and let Hillaby tell you  what you are missing. <br />I suppose if there is one thing to lament about  North America, it's the culture of the automobile with its concomitant  health situation deriving from flabby calves. The English, in particular,  are great walkers and have allowed a place of importance for this national  pastime, in their towns, villages and countryside. Walking is something one  can do in most of Europe, along organised ways, but in England it is  something one does do, and both the ways and byways are, in the main, very  structured. The old straight track is a term coming from the distant past  which refers to a well-trammelled path, usually between the smaller towns.  At one time they might have been drove roads for sheep or cattle. At  others, Roman legions may have tramped down them widely. In the main,  however, the paths across England taken by Hillaby are through farmer's  fields and across the high points of various heaths. Go with him for a  while and you may just be bitten by a bug which will take you (one hopes it  will be on foot) to some of Britain's loveliest spots. They certainly  abound.	2000-05-05

Since they were written at decent intervals and to some extent, for different purposes, there is a degree of repetition. Nevertheless, as  there is hardly ever a dull moment in a text by Mowat, we can forgive him  for telling the same story twice. To be honest, I'm no longer certain where  the overlap occurs, although in \\"Aftermath,\\" a book written comparatively  recently, he certainly revisits some parts of the Italian theatre in which  he served, and refers to the same events he has recounted in detail  elsewhere (\\"And No Birds Sang\\"). But \\"Aftermath\\" doesn't dwell particularly  on war, and there are a number of stories in this ongoing narrative which  are worth reading by themselves. Scenes such as that where the author and  his wife visit the Black Eagle somewhere in Kent and procure some of the  Queen's Brew are classic Mowat. Their visit to Amalfi and tour of its  ancient potteries, and their final return to England where they visit with  Peter Scott, son of the Antarctic explorer, and learn all about the Severn  Wild Fowl Trust, are just a couple of the highlights of this rather unusual  journey.<br />This is not your ordinary Mowat, but then I'm wondering if there  really is such a thing.

It recounts the story of one of the most successful frauds in modern science, and takes a look at the group of men who were behind the initial \\"discovery\\" and who supported it. The culprit has never been found,  but it is supposed that it must have been one of this group who first put  the elements in place, and triggered the find. <br />At the same time, this is  an interesting look at the state of palaeontology in the early part of the  twentieth century. It was due in part to the need for just such a \\"missing  link\\" that science found the so-called Piltdown Man so plausible. In  addition, the fact that \\"he\\" happened to turn up on British soil was  especially pleasing to the English school, which quickly took the  fragmentary evidence under its wing, and proclaimed it loudly. There are a  number of incidents related in the book, which make us wonder just how the  fraud could have continued for nearly fifty years, as it did. It gives us  pause to wonder about the veracity of any scientific assertion whatever,  given the interplay of human pride and greed that may be involved. One of  the participants in the initial story, who verified it and then supported  it to some extent, was the French philosopher and theologian, Teilhard de  Chardin. He was just one of several interesting characters who became  involved in the story, and probably helped to give it credence. <br />A very  good account by a writer who has also given us one of the most interesting  modern books about the King Arthur legend, although it seems to have been  completely overlooked.

It seems obvious that George Orwell the writer and George Orwell the down-and-out are two different people. After all, one had considerably more resources than the other, including a somewhat wider knowledge of society  than your average clochard. However, regardless of whether it was for the  sake of a writer's experience, George Orwell did survive the gruelling  experience of working near the bottom of the Parisian hotel/restaurant  trade as a plongeur. Most of us would have caught the first train home with  funds stolen or otherwise procured in a jiffy. <br />Naturally, working down  in the airless depths of a hotel meant meeting many odd bods that were  otherwise out of Orwell's orbit and this is part of the delight of this  excursion into the subterranean world of the servant classes. The book was  written in the 30s, at a time when European society was about to undergo  the transformations caused by its second bloodletting in three decades.  Orwell takes us back to a period when men sweated freely at their work, in  almost impossible conditions, and considered themselves to be among those  who were better off! It makes one wonder today that road gangs (the workers  were called \\"navvies\\" in Britain) used to do all the work by hand, which is  now done by enormous machines with a little group of workers standing  around looking, waiting to tidy up. Backbreaking work is a thing of the  past for most of us, but it lingers on in the memory of our grandfathers  and comes to life in Orwell's fine text about a forgotten lifestyle of  yesteryear.  <br />His further excursion into the shelters for the homeless in  England is also of interest. There was a way of life, of people always on  the move, occasionally finding seasonal work, (represented by the hobo in  America and the swaggy in Australia), which was well known to many people  but was, even then, coming to an end. Interesting portraits ofan age from  a writer who led a far from sheltered life himself.	2000-04-24

(A Chronicle of Lower Canada)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A fine history of early Québec	In the late 1980s, Jan Henry Morgan embarked on a series of novels relating the story of an Irish immigrant's journey to Québec in what was then Lower Canada. She has completed three volumes of a projected 4-book series, taking her hero Niall O'Donell from his arrival in the 1820s, through the years leading up to and immediately following the Quebec patriots' rebellion to the British crown. <br />This is a very well written history of early Québec, and one which serves to remind us, in many ways, of how little things have changed in 200 years. Morgan draws on a multitude of archival material, some of which she reprints directly in the book, and weaves this original matter in with a finely wrought narrative. Fortunately she points out to us which of the very large cast of characters is real and which invented, otherwise we would have little chance of detecting the inventions. I marvelled at the continuity of the text, which at times sticks so closely to history (especially in reference to the political goings on), and then branches off into a fictional reconstruction of the period which is just as compelling. The line between the two is indiscernible. <br />This is a book which will appeal to a wide audience; it has the researcher's love of detail and the historian's interest in people, places and dates, both combined with the storyteller's gift of narration.  All those interested in nineteenth century history, whether English, American or Canadian, should read it. Those interested particularly in the history of the Patriots should definitely not miss it. Whilst it doesn't have the panorama of a book like Keneally's \\"The Great Shame,\\" it nevertheless has similar depth and interest. It is excellent writing, prepared with flair and originality. Those who find and enjoy the first book will be glad that more volumes follow.	2000-04-24

The Arthurian cycle has inspired and engendered any number of books this century, both fiction and non-fiction. However, very few of them have taken such an original approach to the subject of the \\"real\\" Arthur, nor have many of them been quite so completely overlooked at the same time. In all my reading on the subject over thirty years, I have never once heard or seen this book mentioned anywhere. Yet it is a very good addition to this mighty body of literature, whether it be, as some are no doubt inclined to think, completely fictitious or not. It certainly deserves to come out of its present obscurity.<br />It seems as though Millar stumbled on his theory pretty much by accident. He was living in Brittany for the purpose of writing a book about the Breton tunnymen (or tuna fishermen), when it occurred to him that some of the local place names could be mistaken for those, long argued about, relating to the legendary battles of King Arthur.  Indeed, one of the book's strengths is that, basing his enquiry on information coming down from a ninth century  monk named Nennius, he has been able to completely override the arguments which have sought to place the battle sites in various parts of England, Scotland and Wales. It has been the great weakness all along, that nobody has succeeded in naming all the sites and when they have identified one of them, someone else has insisted that it is some hundreds of miles distant, instead. Everyone wants Arthur for his own. And so it goes on. So Millar decided to investigate and, if he could, to try and place all nine sites into the Breton landscape. The story of his bus ride around the province doing just that, makes terrific reading. Of course, taking Arthur right out of Britain is hardly politically correct, but.... Whether you agree with him or not, this is great detective work and, if you have been interested in Arthur for any length of time, it will certainly leave you wondering.	2000-04-24

To mix this invented family saga in  with that of the war, means that we have a novel of another order  altogether.<br />In this first novel, we are taken inside Hitler's Berlin and  allowed to see the inner workings of the regime, as experienced by Victor  `Pug' Henry, a senior American naval attaché and the story's main hero.  Slowly we are introduced to his family and we follow them as they become  dispersed in different corners of the planet in preparation for the coming  conflict. At the same time, we are given the necessary background to the  American political arena of the period, as Pug becomes drawn into the  unique role as the President's unnamed (and therefore secret) military  aide. He is subsequently sent to all the major scenes of political  influence in the Allied Command, a device which not only works well for the  plot, but gives the reader a very wide reach, beyond what one feels is the  normal grip of propaganda. It's another reason I like the book: it is about  a war in which the truth was continuously bent during and afterwards by all  and sundry (albeit for different reasons). It is good do be able to feel  such confidence in the integrity of Wouk the author, as he reports to us  through the eyes of Pug Henry.<br />In addition to the ordinary (some would  say, far from ordinary) events occurring in the lives of his characters,  Wouk sets the stage for the second book's main story, which is that of the  Jewish ghetto known as Theresienstadt. <br />This is a major work of fiction  and, I would argue, a major work of history as well. Our understanding of a  period in which so much false information was produced, can only be  enhanced by a work in which, right from the beginning, we are not asked to  believe that everything stated is true. We are then left to see for  ourselves what sort of world this was half a century ago, and the clarity  and openness of the text leaves us in no doubt.	2000-04-21

Once you get used to the (odd) style, you can follow an authoritative account of the U.S. Third Army through its training days and then its arrival in the  European theatre, with the spectacular results that ensued. It is, as it  should be, a rollicking sort of book, that recounts the events in mannish  fashion. It's quick and (relatively) easy to read and adds something to our  knowledge of this American hero of the Second World War who, had he had his  way, might have started a third immediately! Four stars because it's worth  reading.	2000-04-21
US	49770667	R1Y061SSV85VN8	0316955159	47347911	War and Remembrance	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A major achievement	This is the second of two books relating the history of the Henry family as they make their various ways through the Second World War. The main character, Victor `Pug' Henry, is an American naval captain who is called  upon to act in an unofficial capacity for the President, and who therefore  sees the war from an extraordinary angle. Such a device creates the  potential for marvellous fiction and Wouk does not let us down.<br />Who knows  what makes a writer write just such a story, and no other. Who can tell how  the balance is achieved in a novel, that keeps us thoroughly in its grip  and leaves us so satisfied at the end. Wouk has achieved these ends  marvellously, and in my opinion, has done so by taking risks with both the  plot and his characters, which, by being successful, raise the work to a  very high level of historical fiction indeed. <br />\\"War and Rembrance\\"  continues the threads of all the family members, starting off with the  events surrounding the attack on Pearl Harbour. The main story in this book  is, however, that of the Jewish ghetto of Theresienstadt, to which, as the  war advances, three of the book's characters are inexorably drawn. It is a  chilling tale and one that deserves to continue being read around the  world.	2000-04-21

In some cases this can be seen as stepping out of the frying pan into the fire. In Lord Russell's case, it just may have helped. <br />Apart from stating the obvious,  that Bertrand Russell needs or should need little introduction, it is as  well to say that his long life was spent, as far as it was public, in  defending or promoting causes. Having gone to prison at a young age because  he could not stomach the Kaiser's war (at least not quietly), he later  returned, if only briefly, way off in the 1960s, defending the cause of CND  in Trafalgar Square. That's quite a bit of history to cover, all from the  same angle. It seems he never regretted the stand he took, nor altered his  views substantially over the decades. He either had to condemn war openly  and publicly, or condemn man privately, which meant taking his own life,  something he says he thought about very seriously and decided against. For  all his faults, whatever they were, it's quite hard to fault him!<br />The  autobiography allows us to accompany him through the bulk of the twentieth  century and see the development of various movements worldwide, in which he  was always involved, at least at the level of the heart, but often  actively. He uses letters a good deal in this text, and these throw light  on that outer world which was so often pulling in an almost opposite  direction. Yet he had his friends and in the bad years when he was a  political outcast, a pariah of sorts in his own college (Trinity College,  Cambridge) there were always those who could see his point of view and  respect it. He was a stubborn man and his stubbornness allowed him to hang  on for much longer than most people would have bothered. In fact, it seems  that he remained true to himself right to the end, and in the end, that is  what gave him life. An interesting book about a lively intelligence,  sometimes brilliantly displayed.	2000-04-19

His father, Eric Linklater (&quot;Magnus Merriman,&quot; &quot;A Prince in the Heather&quot; etc.,) was a well-known writer and friend of  Mackenzie throughout much of his life. It was just a coincidence that Andro  could and would write.<br />A complex man (whoever met a simple Scot?),  Mackenzie was in his prime in the early part of this century and much of  what he wrote all those years ago is slowly fading into the mists of time.  Perhaps he is best remembered for &quot;Whiskey Galore,&quot; a comedy  about a boatload of Scotch washing up on the shore of an island in the  Hebrides, and the fun which ensued. In a sense, it was his moment of glory  (perhaps his &quot;15 minutes&quot;), since the 1948 film made from the  book was popular for many years. Yet he wrote a formidable number of other  good novels (sometimes set in Scotland itself, but not always) such as  &quot;Sinister Street,&quot; and numerous essays and the odd memoir. Like  his books, Mackenzie was a colourful character and makes a good subject for  biography, which Linklater has competently provided.	2000-04-19

Books	5	14	20	N	N	Essential reading for understanding what went on in Germany	I have to say that this isn't a 5-star work because of the writing, the criterion I normally use when dishing out parts of galaxies. It's because I think the book should be read by anyone wanting to gain a glimmer of  understanding into what became one of the most powerfully focused minds in  the last century. Regardless of the pros and cons of Goebells being allowed  to retain even honorary posthumous citizenship of an Earth he seemed bent  on destroying, it is enlightening to read the words he set down. Obviously  they were never intended to be seen by the likes of you or me, let alone  those in power, who later had a chance to peruse them at their leisure. If  only the good (sic) doctor had known.<br />Anyway, following this gentleman of  uncertain disposition down the path to what must have been close to madness  (he must have had to stave madness off quite madly) and what was, an  untimely death (in more ways than one), is an exercise that all students of  human nature will finally be glad they chose to do. After all, he was only  a man, like you and me, and I think that comes through quite plainly in his  own words.	2000-04-19

Besides being a remarkable admission, it is a fine tribute to the translator who, quite  frankly, deserves it. This is a tremendous book but might not be  discernible as such to us English types, without the translation. Knowing  friends have told me that the French version is also excellent.<br />Still  that is not to detract (and how could one?) from the original work. It is a  wonderful story told with supreme control by an author in his prime. One  could go on about the &quot;magical realism&quot; so dear to certain  schools of thought about South American literature, but enough has been  said elsewhere. Yet it is a unique writing style and the book is all the  better for having this advantage. There is a landscape to explore and a  cultural background to examine with which we northerners are not familiar.  For some reason, the book reminds me partly of Castaneda - there's a  dryness to the text as there is on the ground and the houses seem to be  earth-floored dwellings needing a good broom to keep in them in order. Yet  these are just vague impressions gleaned from a wider reading. <br />I don't  think anyone who enjoys reading should miss this. On a list of my favourite  100 books, this would be very high up.	2000-04-18

(English and French Edition)	Books	5	17	20	N	N	Here's another good book out of print	Georges Simenon, as everybody knows, was a Belgian who went to live in Switzerland. Well, that's about what I knew of the fellow before reading this interesting partial autobiography. I think it says somewhere at the beginning that he had intended not to write about himself ever, but that some event involving a child of his changed his mind. Whatever the reason, this look at part of a writer's hectic life is not without interest. <br />Simenon lived in a mist of rumour and legend. Of course, this was largely of his own making and he does little to correct matters in the book. Although known as something of a, to put it politely, lover of women's company, he does not go into this Paris Match side of things at all. Instead, he lets us see a bit of the inner man, or what a clever writer may be selling to us as such, and, all the criticism of him after his death notwithstanding, I for one felt that I got somewhat closer to the enigma. It was almost as if he was saying (in about 1963) that he wasn't such a bad fellow after all. <br />There is much of interest to anyone wondering about the author of Maigret, but precious little about Maigret himself. Just some tedious details of how he could write a novel a week and live rather handsomely without even getting tendinitis. It's hard to know how you can take Georges Simenon seriously. He led a charmed life in many ways, and his famous temper (like that of Peter Sellers) and love of womankind if not mankind, made him a force to be reckoned with. In \\"When I Was Old,\\" we get a glimpse of the man who held millions in thrall for so many years. It's worth the look.	2000-04-17

Morton's books I've read, although I own one or two others. I suppose I must be slow on the uptake or too busy reading other things, not to have read further. This book was five stars all the  way. I've still got the taste of the dust in my mouth.<br />Being something of  a neophyte in matters pertaining to modern day Israel or ancient Palestine,  or vice versa, I was thrilled to find myself in the hands of a gifted  travel writer on this first armchair journey to the Holy Land. Morton knows  how to, how shall I say it, maintain a religious sense in his work without  allowing the reader to detect just how religious (or irreligious) he is.  It's quite clever. Anyway, there is much biblical reference, almost always  referring to the geography through which we pass, or the local  architecture. For instance, his description of the Temple fascinated me. I  must say it gave me a hankering to go to that part of the world, which is  partly what a good travel book ought to do, methinks. Otherwise, I just  enjoyed the writing. Very rhythmic, fluid text which is easy to read and  tends to sweep one along, almost inexorably. I really shall have to dig out  my other Mortons (on the British Isles) and have a go at them. Great read  if you can find it, which shouldn't be too hard: he was a very popular and  widely published author in his day.	2000-04-17

I confess that not all his writing has pleased me as greatly as this and the Goat Boy did. Yet Barth is certainly one of America's finest writers and who are we to say that he should not concoct the odd experiment?<br />What to say about The Sotweed Factor? What to say about any sort of factor indeed, for the title lends a key by itself, in that Barth has managed to use outdated language in the most charming, even disarming fashion. Where our reading of Walter Scott might trip us up a bit today, with his curious references to scenes long past, Barth has been able to provide remarkable clarity within a text tinctured by an old-fashioned way of speaking.<br />Apart from the ups and downs of one Ebenezer Cooke, whose adventures form the novel's main thread, there is a marvellous character, the like of which I've not encountered elsewhere in literature, unless it was in Chris Scott's forgotten but not-to-be-despised, \\"Bartleby.\\" Burlingame is an unknown quantity in the text who pops up time and time again, and shows a mastery on the part of Barth which one feels is beyond mere words. It is both an ingenious and magical novel, with added historical interest for those who know aught about this period in America's colonisation. As someone once wrote about \\"Bartleby,\\" \\"The Sotweed Factor\\" is a comic monsterpiece as well as being a finely crafted and even, possibly, elegant novel from a consummate artist.	2000-04-16

Both books tell the story of a youth who is orphaned and sent to be with his trapper/outdoorsman uncle up in the far north of Canada. In  this volume, the southern authorities appear on the scene, wishing to  remove the still underage central character back to the south, for \\"his own  good.\\" In company with an Indian girl and an Eskimo lad, our hero sets off  into the northern wilderness, trying to keep one step ahead of the police.  Mowat then brings in the story of an old Viking grave which he had already  woven into the first volume. What follows is a voyage of discovery during  which the three members of the team help each other to overcome the  hardship of the land, as they travel down a river road known only in the  folk lore of the northern tribes, and not used in generations. The story  hangs finally on this question: will they make it?<br />It is a thrilling  journey and a fine novel and if your children don't appreciate it, I'm sure  you will. It's a fascinating journey into native cultures as well, although  I believe there is some debate about what right a man like Farley Mowat has  to even get involved with \\"their\\" culture. For me, the sensitivity of books  like this one, whether towards man or the environment, speaks volumes by  itself.	2000-04-16

(Although \\"The Regiment\\" does not specifically concern Mowat's adventures, much of its path is common to his own.) \\"My Father's Son\\" is also a tribute to his father Angus, and acknowledges the contribution made by him to Mowat's progress as a writer.  Mowat senior was also a published author, but never achieved the pre-eminence of his son. <br />Most of the book is concerned with the military details of Mowat's own experience, starting with his failed attempt to be inducted into the army due to his youthful appearance! He eventually succeeded in getting into the Hasty Ps, his father's regiment. So father and son were able to salute each other in uniform for a time, the one as a major, the other as a private. From there we are taken through the lengthy process of training, embarkation, arrival and billeting in England and the further long wait to go to war. Those who know Mowat's writing will enjoy this book for the usual reasons; there is an urgency to his writing and a singular facility for finding the right words, even for conveying the mundane. Those who are interested in Mowat the person, will as usual, find him hesitant to completely open up about his personal life. Never mind; he tells us a great deal about himself by leaving certain things unsaid. This is a good read if you can find it.	2000-04-16

The other thing I like about it is that it proves  that Farley Mowat can write just about anything he sets his mind to.  <br />With an historical background that is not negligible (nor does it matter  much to the actual plot), the book Mowat has set out to write is ostensibly  for children. It follows a classic \\"Boys Own\\" formula of putting the action  safely into the hands of a pair of enterprising youngsters who then have to  deal as well as they can with the baddies. It is really an excellent story  of the sea; readers of maritime literature will love the boat that lends  its name to the book, and bewail its apparent fate near the end. I suppose  children will also like this book, although it seems so old-fashioned in  many ways. Nevertheless, if you can convince a 12-year-old to have a look  at it, you may make another convert, both to Mowat and the art of reading.  Just don't forget to read it yourself!<br />Mowat seems to have tried an  experiment with this book and I am confounded a bit to know why he didn't  try and take it a bit further with other volumes. He had already written  one of his Arctic stories for children, \\"Lost in the Barrens,\\" by the time  he wrote this one, and he subsequently wrote a sequel to it. But \\"The Black  Joke\\" has to stand alone and I suppose all one can say is that, based on  his output since its 1962 publication, it has nothing to do with fearing  the hard work of writing. Excellent and underrated book.	2000-04-16

Cut off from normal communication by road for the three or four months of the annual wet season, Darwin used to  go into a winter hibernation unlike anything known to North Americans or  Europeans. This is the tropical setting of a fine novel by the writer Peter  Goldsworthy. <br />I used to think that Darwin was the sort of place in which  anything might happen. With its transient population of seasonal workers  and government servants on 2-year postings, its tropical growing season  which can transform a vacant block into a jungle-like garden in under two  years, it is not your typical Australian town. So it is the perfect setting  in some ways for a meeting of minds, a crossing of roads, which require a  certain fecundity of spirit to infuse them. This is a story about  mentorship, about discovery, about the old world and the new. It is a short  novel, but an extremely satisfactory one.	2000-04-14

One wonders what he must have been thinking as much of it was bombed into oblivion in the 1940s. It is certainly a very  idyllic place, and one in which it might have been, under certain  conditions, pleasant to live. Social politics is not Hesse's strong point;  he is more concerned with the individual. In this novel Hesse takes us into  the Europe of the Middle Ages to explore the relationship between student  and master.  I think it is really my favourite, but then, there are so many  trying to lay claim to the title, it's hard to be sure. It is a book about  youth, about enquiry and about travelling, all at once. Hesse's writing, or  the very fine translation of it, has a poetic quality that is unsurpassed  for me in modern literature. It seems to help the reader form a deeper  impression of the very countryside through which this pair of travellers  passes. At the same time, there is a landscape of the mind to which one  wishes to return, time and again. For me, Narcissus and Goldmund is a  voyage into a time lost, where the very air is somehow rarefied and the  colours of grassy fields are at once, soft and vibrant. Tremendous writing;  timeless literature.	2000-04-14

This is the classic volume on the art of walking (well, not really the  art: Hillaby thought it was a natural function). For those who cannot  remember the last time they walked to a corner store, the prospect of  actually walking the length of England (not one of the world's longer  islands!) may be somewhat daunting. So sit back and let Hillaby tell you  what you are missing. <br />I suppose if there is one thing to lament about  North America, it's the culture of the automobile with its concomitant  health situation deriving from flabby calves. The English, in particular,  are great walkers and have allowed a place of importance for this national  pastime, in their towns, villages and countryside. Walking is something one  can do in most of Europe, along organised ways, but in England it is  something one does do, and both the ways and byways are, in the main, very  structured. The old straight track is a term coming from the distant past  which refers to a well-trammelled path, usually between the smaller towns.  At one time they might have been drove roads for sheep or cattle. At  others, Roman legions may have tramped down them widely. In the main,  however, the paths across England taken by Hillaby are through farmer's  fields and across the high points of various heaths. Go with him for a  while and you may just be bitten by a bug which will take you (one hopes it  will be on foot) to some of Britain's loveliest spots. They certainly  abound.	2000-04-13

There is a dry quality to it, as though the writer is being very  sparing of his words and a sort of inflammability in the prose so that you  never quite know what's likely to happen next. This sparse writing,  although it may use masses of text at the same time, creates a tension  which holds the reader in thrall to some extent. I can imagine that not  everyone will like it. <br />The end result is a dramatic situation which is  rendered imminently plausible by this technique of keeping the reader off  guard. I found myself admiring it the more I read. The novel is not an easy  one to accept. The proposition involved has one squirming, though at no  time did I think of giving the book up. On the contrary, the increasing  uneasiness engendered by the plot was being masterfully counterbalanced by  the tight control of the writer. At the end, I could only take my hat off  to a fine, possibly a great accomplishment. Having read Ireland before with  considerable pleasure (\\"The Glass Canoe,\\" \\"The Chantic Bird\\"), \\"The  Flesheaters\\" confirmed to me that I was in the hands of a first-class  Australian author. I must say that was a relief, since there has been quite  a bit of published work from Down Under in the last decade or two that has  left me utterly cold.	2000-04-12

However, whenever I am asked what is the finest piece of literature  to come out of Australia, I unhesitatingly reply that this is it. It has  everything that an Australian could wish for that is representative of that  very eccentric land, and much more besides. <br />The name alone should give  the alert reader something to think about. Isn't it odd? It is the starting  point and central theme around which the whole turns and part of the  majesty of this novel lies in that cardinal simplicity. It never gets lost.  No matter into what dreamtime corner or shady southern political deal the  author takes us, we understand that one central thing. And beyond that,  where every truly giant novel must go (\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\\" \\"Under  the Volcano\\"), there is an underpinning of universal truth that makes us  aware that this is no mere provincial affair, that Herbert is not just idly  lamenting in some forgotten corner of the globe. <br />The other  characteristic that makes it truly incomparable on the Australian scene, is  that it can be read at so many levels. Herbert may be taking a hard look at  many issues unresolved in the Australia of the forties and fifties, but  have we come to terms with them today? And are the political shenanigans  that take place in the land of Auz, so very different from those elsewhere?   Whether you are interested in Australian history, or in learning something  about the aborigines, or seeing the outback in all its glory, this is the  book. And as for it being too long, I can almost guarantee that the reader  who once gets a head of steam up, will be still be puffing like billy-o at  page 1,463. And if you are still ready for more by then, well you're in  luck, because Herbert wrote a further volume about life innorthern  Australia, \\"Capricornia.\\" It is not a sequel and it is not, in my opinion,  of exactly the same calibre, but it is a very fine book nonetheless. \\"Poor  Fellow, My Country\\" should not be out of print, ever. It is one of those  books that will endure, because it goes beyond the run of everyday  storytelling into the realm of great literature.	2000-04-12

Captured during the desert campaign, he was taken into Italian hands (from which he almost escaped), before being moved to Germany and a much more serious sort of  imprisonment at the hands of the Nazis. Yet he managed to escape, jumping  from a train on the final leg of a transfer and then making his way from  the heart of Germany into France. There he undergoes still further  adventures with all sorts of folk that he hopes are in the Resistance, but  is never quite sure. It's a mad tale, that only a war could provide, and it  is well told by this future writer who went on, in the latter stages of the  war, to act as an agent for the Maquis, the much-feared French underground  movement based in the south of France. He has written a number of novels  recounting his wartime experiences and several of them, notably this one  and \\"Road to Resistance,\\" tend to repeat the same story overmuch.

Very few of us lived through it and overshadowed as it was by other events soon afterwards, the passions it aroused, though  virulent and enduring in both art and literature, have become dimmed over  time. I imagine that in the generation under thirty-five today, those who  have the vaguest notion of what took place then, would hardly form a  legion. Of course, it is better known that a number of major figures from  the literary and artistic world of the twenties went to fight (some on  either side) in Spain. It is also probably well known that the Germans,  Russians and Italians all sent troops or technical specialists to sharpen  their own wares for the conflict to which this one proved but a prelude.  Yet the extraordinary passions that were aroused in Spain and that reached  out and infected so many of the foreign volunteers, have to be experienced  by individuals and perhaps the best way I know of coming close to the  tremulous heart of that ugly story is through Malraux. The book has been  written as fiction by a master storyteller. The action, all of which is  real and much of which was witnessed at first hand, is simply gripping. The  tears it should properly evoke will also, I have no doubt, be real ones. In  a way, Malraux, who also wrote a similar and equally fine book about  revolution in China, is offering us a lament for all that died in those  years, for crushed spirits and youth spent as fodder for cannons. It is a  magnificent human story; regrettably it is one of tragedy. But if we are to  remember the Holocaust of the Nazis, why should we forget the deadly  internecine warfare of Spain? Indeed, how could we.<br />This review concerns  the translation by Stuart Gilbert and Alastair Macdonald, which was  excellent. Once again, there are so many books in the world, I know, but  this one should not be out of print.	2000-04-11

Set in outlandish places in all corners of the Earth, they all have a sort of question mark attached to them, perhaps asking: Now, what's going on here?  \\"On the Black Hill,\\" is, I maintain, set in as outlandish a spot as any of  them. The Welsh countryside has bred just as odd examples of humanity as  the green hills of Kentucky or the wide veldt of South Africa. Yet Chatwin  sees through them all, down to some sort of common denominator, and what we  have in this book is the most human story to issue from this pen. The story  of the twins will not only delight for its old-fashioned setting and  eccentric but somehow so British behaviour, it will also draw you into  Chatwin's elegant prose with its remarkable tempo (you might almost call it  metre) and ability to colour scenes with gouache-like softness and light.  In fact, coming to Chatwin through \\"On the Black Hill\\" may not be such a  good idea. Read \\"The Songlines\\" first, and failing that, read \\"Utz\\" either  before or after. In any case, although this short-lived modern writer has  not left us the overwhelming legacy we might normally have expected, there  is sufficient material to keep you occupied and thinking about your own and  Chatwin's world, for some time to come. And in the end you'll see that  Bruce Chatwin's not provincial at all.	2000-04-11

This particular journey into Eastern literature and mysticism lacks a strong foundation and I do not feel that Hesse is comfortable at all on such distant terrain. Siddhartha  is a lacklustre figure by comparison with his European models and I do not  think that we (nor Hesse for that matter) can come away from the book with  much sense of discovery. There should be the right kind of scene available  here for Hesse to show us his ineffable poetic qualities.  Somehow he  misses the beat, I don't know why, and we are left with a sense of his not  having quite established the meaning (that seems nonetheless, to be all  around him), in a way for readers to understand. It may be that I fell in  love with a Western Hesse too soon, which I did, but I do not see the  magic, and certainly not the Hesse magic, in this, of all his novels.	2000-04-11

Well, part of it is supposed to be improved, Ecotopia being a breakaway republic which decides to leave the bulk of mainland U.S.A. choking in its  pollution and squabbling with foreigners. In fact, the thesis for  Ecotopia's origin is that things are going so badly in middle America, that  the once omnipresent state has no time to react to its own remote  dissidents. <br />With that, and a communications blackout strictly enforced  in the northern Californian, Washington state and Oregon zone which forms  the new independent state, Ecotopia goes its own way. What it does during  the first years of its experimental nationhood, becomes subject matter for  a reporter from the East who is allowed in to have a look-see. And what he  sees blows his mind. Callenbach has taken all the roadblocks away from  modern science and let them go for it. You want free solar energy - it's  down this road; you want non-polluting technologies that work, they're over  here. Suddenly liberated from the weight of autocratic state and industrial  institutions, the new science that is intended to create a pollution-free  society of responsible citizens devoted to living on the Earth, not off of  it, takes off and starts providing the answers that are now being sought. A  trifle idealistic you say? Not a bit of it. Callenbach pretends that he  believes every word of it, so why shouldn't we! <br />Yet the main point of  Ecotopia, besides being, dare I say it, worthwhile fiction (!), is to ask  that simple question: What if? What if indeed. This book will remain a  classic of its kind and be referred to wonderingly in aeons to come, as one  of the first attempts to nail down a possible alternative future for the  monolithic U. S. of A. And what works for America...	2000-04-11

Anyone with an appetite for Arctic literature or northern sailing stories will enjoy this one. Apart from giving us some fine writing and a simple, vivid story,  Adlard takes us back to the last days of sail and the hunting of whales in  Greenland waters. The timbers creak on board ship and the whalers somehow  engage our entire attention and sympathy, simple poor men that they are,  even though in our so much more developed world, we shun the very notion of  their trade. But for generations they had to do this job, leaving for  months at a time, frequently falling victim to the ice. In seaport towns on  both sides of the Atlantic and in parts of the Southern Hemisphere as well,  there are rich traditions associated with the ghastly ritual of the  harpoon. It is just as well that their stories be preserved; it is a  vanished way of life and one that needs to be more carefully documented.  <br />I don't know any more about Mark Adlard, but it is indeed a pity that he  seems not to have published much other work. &quot;The Greenlander&quot;  whether as history or as fiction, is very good quality material.	2000-04-10

Beyond the more obvious impediments to clear understanding such as language, there lies a world of hidden signs and meanings that only reveal  themselves slowly, and only then to the sure-footed. Castaneda has written  about such experiences, and others have tried with varying degrees of  success. Harvey Arden has, all in all, written a remarkable book about the  Australian aborigine and his attempt to find a means of expression after  the drab interlude of cultural effacement that followed colonisation.  <br />Are we really surprised that these folk have voices of their own? Some  of the more remarkable native or aboriginal people of the late twentieth  century, are former alcoholics and derelicts. Seen in another life, just a  few years ago, most of Western humanity would have found it degrading to  even go near them. And yet these were just superficial aspects of the  person, which can be seen past if the intention to look is there. Mr. Arden  is such a seeker, obviously. I remember thinking at the time I read  &quot;The Dreamkeepers,&quot; what an amazing thing it was for this to have  been written by an American visitor to Australia. The author seemed to have  such a grasp of the people and their environment that I felt, surely it  must have taken a local writer to develop this degree of understanding. But  no, relative stranger to Australia that he was, Mr. Arden had the human  touch required and succeeded where, in my opinion, few others would have.  This is a fine book and yet another that does not deserve, at all, to be  out of print.	2000-04-10

Until things had settled down, and let's not forget that they only ever partially settled  down (Patton's cry of \\"Let's push on to Moscow,\\" still rings in one's  ears), little or no information was available to the Western press about  the successful Russian attack against the German capital. John Toland's  \\"The Last 100 Days,\\" first published in 1966, was therefore a welcome  addition to the growing literature on the end of the regime. Perhaps the  most interesting sections of the book deal with the taking of Berlin and  the stubborn defence offered by the citizenry (both old men and boys were  killed at the barricades). For American readers, there is no doubt that the  race for Berlin is of greater interest still. With the fastidious Bernard  Montgomery apparently holding up the progress of U.S. army corps, it was a  time of grand confusion. No one wanted to be restrained from the final  fruits of victory. Impatient army commanders resented every delay, while at  home, political leaders tried to balance the final thrust to victory  against the prospect of further warfare in Europe, once the Germans were  beaten. And of course, beyond the first difficulties in East/West  relations, there remained Japan to be beaten in the Pacific.<br />All the main  characters have their turn on Toland's stage, whether they be American and  Russian generals calculating the mileage separating them from their goal,  or high-ranking Nazis twisting and turning in the net that is slowly  closing around them. A fast-paced book, matching the tempo of the times,  \\"The Last 100 Days\\" is one of the best books about the end of the Second  World War to be published so far.	2000-04-10

Being  stationed as a reporter in Berlin from the mid-thirties until just before  America entered the war, certainly helped when the time came to take a deep  breath and begin this work. However, what really spurred him on was the  enormous, much too voluminous amount in fact, of material left behind by  the German general staff and almost all government ministries, presumably  in their panic to escape the Russians. In fact, Russian units entering the  centre of the city found a few desultory piles of classified material  burning behind the Reichstag and were even able to save much of that.<br />This is a work that falls between two categories. It is hardly light  enough reading to be easily packaged as an ordinary paperback (although  paperback editions abound); nor is it a scholarly work trying to be  complete in every detail, with all the antics of the vast assemblage of  characters carefully foot-noted, cross-referenced and indexed. It is a  solid book, but fortunately, immensely readable and I wonder how you could  really get around an understanding of the Third Reich without it (or why  you would want to). In addition, its writer is an American and for some  reason, that seems to make it more dependable. Shirer is no fool; he treats  the subject with openness and honesty, giving us what I feel is a better,  more reliable view than certain European sources might do. This is in spite  of a certain tendency he has to view the main protagonists with a jaundiced  eye. But who could really view the von Ribbentrops and Goerings of this  world with extreme fairness, much after 1940?<br />There is nothing like  having been there, and Shirer has recorded his experiences in diary form in  \\"Berlin Diary,\\" which is also well worth reading. But if you are going to  read just one main book about the history of the Third Reich, you won't go  far wrong with this one.

Reconstituting the final weeks, he takes us into the pit in which Hitler  finally withdrew, after having lived much of the war in a series of other  bunkers (or lairs) on the different fronts. All the ordinary comings and  goings of the (mostly) elite Nazis with, in some cases, their spouses and  children, and the occasional dentist, serve to remind us of the banality of  Hitler's life even as he lived it in the midst of a hell largely of his own  creation. The death of Roosevelt and the momentary delusion, enhanced by  the now straw-grasping Dr. Goebells, that the tide had turned and that  Germany's enemies would assuredly be swept from the plains over which they  were then unstoppably advancing, brings home to us the tenuous nature of  Hitler's hold on reality. Hitler appears very frail and human at the end,  let down by everyone \\"he trusted.\\" His dreams of German lebensraum  defeated, his armies scattered, his own days numbered, we can almost come  to some sort of empathetic understanding in the presence of this  all-too-human shortcoming, of pride going before the fall.<br />This is a good  contribution to the literature on the end of the Third Reich and to some  extent, on Hitler himself. Written only just after the end of the war,  (this review refers to the 1947 edition, which I believe has since been  revised and updated by the author) it has perhaps been superseded today by  other, longer works (Alan Bullock's \\"Hitler\\" is the main one that comes to  mind). On the other hand, it is of interest to focus mainly on the end of  this long and ghastly reign, and Mr. Trevor-Roper has confided it to us  with clarity and precision.	2000-04-10

He was alone amongst those high-ranking Nazis who were closest to Hitler, to escape execution. To say  that for a certain amount of time, his life hung very much in the balance  would be putting it mildly. Yet thanks to the failure of the Russians, who  wanted him dead, Speer lived on and produced this remarkable memoir of a  world gone mad. One hardly thinks that any other single Nazi could have  produced a document as worthy of our attention. How curious the fates  are.<br />Part of what kept Speer alive at the end of the war was a certain  identifiable integrity, which comes through in the book. Perhaps he is also  masking certain people and shielding us from the absolute truth of certain  events, but in the main, one senses he is concerned with the truth and is  not afraid of it being revealed. It may be a small thing to say that his  greatest accomplishment as a Reich minister was to prevent Hitler from  completely paralysing Germany in the final months and weeks.  Yet I think  it is indicative of his character, which therefore reassures us about the  worth of this book, that he bit the bullet at the end, and refused to  participate any further in what had clearly become the final ranting of his  erstwhile belovèd Führer. One should definitely read Speer for a further  appreciation of the subject matter, to round out any non-German sources. I  think we can be quite happy that he did not, in the end, get the chop.	2000-04-10

At least it shows my own prejudice in favour of a novel which is probably out of favour today, and not sufficiently read by a new generation in search of, or besieged by, a devil within. A novel that can be read on many levels, it also contains pungent writing that carries the odours of a world that has been all but banished from North America today. It is, if you like, an unclean world, in which much is to be expected, little obtained. Whether from the religious rites, with all their devotions and ecstasies, or the characters who are more familiar to us (and who are sometimes smiling shyly to us from the edges of other novels by Graham Greene or Gabriel Garcia Marquez), much is promised, little given. But, as for the characters themselves, the disappointment that may greet us is only transitory, leaving us to march the march of faith on our own terms, and carry whatever remnant of the garment of civilisation we have managed to save to the last, on our voyage into the heart of this epic novel. And there lies its great strength; it is a novel with a beating, living, enervating heart and those who remain for the journey will surely be marked by it, as by all literature of this calibre.	2000-04-09

A. Henty. Henty died in 1902 or  thereabouts, having written his last books about the actions which took  place in the war opposing English troops and Boer commandos. And that was  his formula, first and foremost to record in print the historical events  associated with any British military venture from the early Middle Ages  onwards. The other characteristic of his writing was, that it was intended  for consumption by boys and as such it was typical of a genre that was well  developed in the late Victorian period. Henty's prefaces invariably start,  \\"My Dear Boys,\\" and he developed a sort of intimacy with his youthful  audience that eventually made him something of a best selling author at the  end of last century. It is interesting to note that he is still in print,  or was until very recently.<br />Most of his books have a two-fold purpose  therefore; recounting (mainly) military history and inculcating a certain  notion of the standard of behaviour to be expected from a future young  subaltern. No doubt, of the thousands of officers from British and colonial  regiments who went to the front in 1915 and dashed themselves bravely  against the German wall, a great many had had this form of early Henty  training. Having read so many of them, one can scarcely recall the actual  details of plots and sub-plots. Yet on the details of the history involved,  there is much to learn, as Henty was a meticulous man who recorded as fully  as possible (and some times too fully, it must be admitted, with respect to  the endless movements of particular regiments into the line) the events he  describes. He is equally good at sea as on land and has written some  classics of maritime literature, particularly \\"Under Drake's Flag,\\" and   \\"Cochrane the Dauntless.\\" So while Henty can hardly be expected to have a  wide audience today, for those who find him to their taste, it must be said  that the material, most of which will have to be located second hand, is  not wanting.	2000-04-09

There were many aspects of this life which were unusual certainly,  and a number of pointers exist that can give us insight into just how he  ended the way he did. At the very end, when finally having to give himself  up to the Americans (as he and many other Nazi staffers were suddenly so  eager to do, since the Russians were in Berlin), it appeared for a moment  that the whole thing (the war) had just been a bad joke that had gone  slightly sour. Goering thought, for just a while, that he would be accorded  the rights normally associated with high-ranking prisoners in his  circumstances; being able to give his parole and so on. The awful truth  only dawned on him as he was brought back slowly but certainly for trial,  and we know in the end that he (quite cleverly) avoided the worst, by  crunching down on a cyanide capsule. Thus ended the career of this First  World War ace, a man who had no doubt suffered from some extraordinary  delusions in his time, who had probably failed in his duty to his own  people (by allowing the Luftwaffe to stagnate) and who had been the staunch  supporter of the man later to wear the not so thorny crown of history's  worst felon.<br />It is an easy read, and for students of the period, or for  anyone wanting to glean the details without having to go through the  transcripts of the Nuremberg trials or other voluminous works, it is to be  highly recommended.	2000-04-09

The trick, or real art, which  they demonstrate, is in showing us a slice of that ordinary world we think  we all know, as though it were the most normal thing in the world, and then  bringing out the oddity that is never far below the surface. So \\"In the  Wet,\\" one of his more imaginative novels, takes us bit by bit into the  remote parts of tropical northern Australia, building up tiny details from  characters and race days and scraps of conversation, until the real story,  hidden just below the surface, begins to emerge. Shute, whose background is  very much that of an experimental scientist with oil on his hands, is never  more impressive than when he leads the unsuspecting reader through the  mundane material world that we think we see, onto another plane altogether.  Not afraid in the least of exploring spirituality, Shute acts as an  intelligent, well-informed guide for the reader on a voyage of discovery.  Never intruding on the narrative, yet masterfully keeping it in rein, he is  an author whose novels have long been considered merely \\"popular,\\" when in  fact they are often penetrating inquiries into the meaning of life. <br />One  other characteristic of Shute's writing that is perhaps more apparent today  than it was in the fifties and sixties is that his work is always set in  the contemporary period of a world undergoing vast change. He lived and  served and worked through two world wars and the effects of these  cataclysmic events were such as to shake up the foundations of the very  science which had made so many people feel so secure for a time. Therefore,  his texts today also provide interesting excursions into that world, from  1920 to 1960, which was not only metamorphosing into the more colourful  world of the Beatles, Vietnam and Tricky Dicky Nixon, but which has since  very completely disappeared from the ken of anyone much under fifty. Of  course, if all you are after is a good story told by a competent  storyteller, you won't be disappointed either.	2000-04-09

Looking further afield, toward its potential readership, one wonders how far it can go. Without doubt destined to become a classic piece of  twentieth century literature, it is nevertheless a very troublesome tome  for a readership not yet convinced of its own vulnerability.<br />Bret Easton  Ellis holds nothing back - it is perhaps the real strength of the book,  beyond the impeccable writing. Dealing with the very worm twisting itself  around in the depths of the human soul, Ellis has exposed the beast's  progress to some extent, in a way carefully avoided by almost all other  modern writers (exceptions would be Chris Scott, \\"Bartleby;\\" Colin Wilson,  a number of novels, particularly \\"Lingard\\"). In so doing, he has given us a  finely grained exposé of just how life in the late twentieth century is  progressing. Is it fair to say that all of society is reflected in the  mechanical rituals of the zombie-like Patrick Batemen? That is hardly the  point. Ellis is taking us to a place which, as a society, we have not  reached yet. But at the same time, he is carefully exploding the myth of  late twentieth century materialism, and serving us an extremely graphic  warning of what is to come. I for one, respect what I take to be the  intentions of this skilful portrayal of a society starting to consume  itself, almost like the worm that eats its own body, starting at the tail  and working relentlessly back towards the very mouth that is doing the  feeding. Troublesome indeed, but needs to be read.	2000-04-08

Firstly, it is about South Africa and, to the extent that outsiders know anything about that troubled country, it serves as a lesson to what the future might hold for any nation which falls into  the grip of a race war. From this point of view it is a very ugly novel.  Happily, it has some highly redeeming features which make us want to read  through all the trouble and strife. <br />Bryce Courtenay is a good writer. He  is able to involve us in the story from the beginning with well-drawn  characters. The central character starts the book off as a small boy,  living in South Africa during the Second World War. As if the black/white  race problems are not enough, we find out (those of us who didn't know)  that there is also extremely bad blood `twixt English and Boer. So when  young Peekay is sent to be the lone Englishman attending an Afrikaner  boarding school, he is really in hot water. Thus begins one of the most  unusual educations you could wish for and how Peekay eventually manages to  turn every disadvantage to his favour is part of the delight of this  chronicle.<br />Besides being a good yarn, this book has considerable depth  and we can follow Peekay quite closely as he learns all about Latin and  Greek, cacti, boxing and especially, human nature. By the age of twelve, he  is so well versed in these matters, not to mention the machinations of the  Pentecostal Church and the workings of the South African Prison system,  that he is clearly a boy apart, who may be destined for stranger things  still. <br />If you have the slightest interest in South Africa, you will  enjoy this book from many angles. It is a story about the twentieth century  and one of its most pressing problems, which we have now brought forward  into this one. In any case, most readers will have trouble putting it down,  as it is the story of an unusual life told with passion and honesty.	2000-04-08

At the same time, \\"Trinity\\" enabled me to discover something about my own Irish background, and put the perspective of history into a new position for me altogether. In fact, so tainted were we, some of us, by the version of the other protagonists in that ghastly story, that we had a curious emotion, verging on shame, when it came to being part-Irish and perhaps more importantly, not sufficiently English. I imagine that a great many people know what I mean. It is through books like \\"Trinity,\\" Keneally's \\"The Great Shame\\" and McCourt's \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" that we are starting, many of us who were not born in Ireland but who have solid links of former ownership (however tenuous they might have appeared), to finally get the gist. I know one person who really had almost a prejudice against their own Irish family of last century, who came away from \\"Trinity\\" with a very different perspective indeed.<br />It's really an awful story, and if you wonder any longer why the troubles have continued so long and so bitterly into the last century and, quite possibly, into this one, you must be reading it upside down. At the same time, it's a great Uris yarn, if one may be permitted to say so. And it doesn't make me ashamed at all, after reading this, to be doing some proper wearing of the green.	2000-04-08

Indeed, the book had been sitting handy for years before I took the plunge. Now I have to ask myself if it is not my favourite of all. It is such a good book, such an unusual one, that I shudder to think that I might have missed it. I thought Mary Stewart told a pretty good Arthurian tale, in which the good earth of the sixth century clung to Ambrosius' leather sandals and the ground was damp and musty behind the stone walls of the little hamlet where Arthur lay... and so on.  Yes they were great books, well worth reading. I thought T.H. White magnificent; I loved Arthur being an ant or whatever he was at one stage in the \\"Once and Future King.\\" I bought all of it and marveled at the spirit it invoked, of that faraway time. I enjoyed Chopra as well; thought it was excellent in fact. And many others...<br />But Bradley. Oh it is an outstanding book, in every sense. I am in Glastonbury, I am in faerie, I am in the Celtic lands for certain; and I do not want to come back. There is a woman's touch, no doubt, but I don't think it's a womanish book. It is a very human story, told with a women's gift, that of enhanced intuition,  and without male bluntness perhaps.  But why go on: just start reading. It is priceless.	2000-04-08

Told with humour and verve and a tongue very much in the cheek, it is nevertheless a serious inquiry into what motivates man to do the things he does. One can see Mowat sitting up there in the ice and snow of the Arctic, scratching away at what was then a healthy head of hair and the beginnings of a very respectable beard, wondering, \\"what on earth can they be thinking of,\\" as he tries to deal with the odd behaviour of government machinery thousands of miles away to the south. Further, and this is I suppose the point of the book, what is he to do about this animal he has been sent, not to study, but to convict, who simply won't behave like the awful predator he is alleged to be? Why is man disposed to decide upon things first, and then learn the truth afterwards (often when it is too late)? And having found out the truth of the matter for himself, what should Mowat do about it? Well, I think the subsequent career of this ardent defender of natural causes speaks for itself. In fact, just before you read his environmental masterpiece, \\"Sea of Slaughter,\\" you should read this. It's the tip of the iceberg, but it will perhaps soften the blow.	2000-04-07

It is of a sandy ocean beach, miles and miles long, where tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of morse came to socialize every summer until the middle of last century. The morse, or northern walrus, was a stupendous animal, of impressive bearing: a veritable lion of the sea. Yet it comes no more to those grounds, once the largest colony of its kind, out on Canada's Magdalene Islands, off the coast of Québec. <br />To think that the morse were just a side-show to it all. To think that eventually, with the same energy and relentless mechanical force, we would come to decimate the northern fishery more or less entirely, leaving thousands of perplexed fisher folk stranded in coastal villages, wondering perhaps, just where that many fish could possibly have gone.<br />On land, as in the water, nature's bounty was scarcely less prolific, the European's first reaction, scarcely less horrendous. Could this be the true, unknown history of North America, lying behind and directly concerning those early pilots and navigators like Cabot and Columbus. 400 or more years of unbelievably short-sighted culling of mighty herds, whether they were whales or bison or a hundred other species of birds and mammals known to have been hunted to the last. This is Mowat's sad chronicle. This is his portrait of what one day perhaps, will generally be known and accepted as history. And the only thing that may stop us is that we find we really don't want to ever learn this sort of truth. <br />Besides being a remarkable contribution to the literature of ecology and environment, this is also one of Mowat's finest personal efforts. You can see by the very nature of the material that it took a being of remarkable strength just to tackle a project like this, let alone bring it to a conclusion. It's probably true that one can prepare all one's life for just one event. In Mowat's case, without negatingany other part of his remarkable uvre, this may just be it.	2000-04-07

Leaving &quot;On the Beach&quot; to one side, Nevil Shute is a writer who does a tradesman-like job, and can normally be counted on for a good story with an interesting  background to it. This book must have been suggested to him by his  publisher or something of the kind. Perhaps he was obliged to write it, for  some contractual reason or other. It does not even come close to his other  books, some of which are minor classics of mid-twentieth century literature  (although usually disdained by the intelligentsia as not being literature  of any kind).<br />I suppose the subject matter is such that the book is worth  reading anyway. If you are willing to fumble and stumble along with the ups  and downs of the writing, the story is not, historically, without interest.  Yet I don't think many readers will be terribly convinced by the poor plot  and simplistic characters. It's a facile book that I can't imagine Shute  himself being very proud of, in spite of its relative success (due no  doubt, to the film).	2000-04-07

Why architecture is important and what makes it so is the subject matter here, brought to us by a very competent  writer. Delightfully so, in fact, as Rybczynski has the storyteller's  ability to weft and weave. <br />The stories he has chosen here are a mixed  bunch and we are asked to think about such diverse constructions as the  American bungalow, the Grow Home and public buildings like the Canadian  Centre for Architecture. He has stories to tell about all of them, the  people who live in or use them and the odd trends which are sometimes  responsible for a particular design. As he points out, although we use  architecture every day of our lives and are clearly affected by it (whether  we know it or not), we are more than prone to take it for granted. Should  we not be more aware of what's around us, in general? This book offers up  some thoughtful ideas on the subject.	2000-04-06

In addition, who are you (or who am I) to think that we have just the right way to impart just the right information to other writers. It's a ticklish subject altogether and I expect there may be those who think Blackburn has gone out on the proverbial limb. Well, he has, but for my money, he's still up there swaying. This is a fine book, written by a fine, experienced writer who has somehow managed to avoid becoming jaundiced by his years of professional journalism. I won't say I didn't at least think that I detected some flaws, but my reading of it really made me feel that it was flawless. Blackburn uses a tone which manages to avoid silly witticisms and harsh or overt criticism in a book which is, and ought to be, critical enough of the trade. He's not settling any old scores with former editors as far as I can see, either. No, he obviously had this book inside him and we may be very glad that it found its way out.

Although one feels that he is  never more than a heartbeat away from the action, he does not intrude upon  it. It is the People's story; he is just the teller. As for the story he  tells, it is not a pretty one.<br />In the book, he evokes a scene in a  coastal town of the Arctic, in which a supply ship is making a stopover.  Excitement runs through the townspeople as the ship's crew and passengers  are brought to shore. It is a very bright moment in an otherwise dull,  monotonous routine. One of the passengers detaches himself from the crowds  leaving the vessel and makes his way through the town to an encampment on  its edge. Tents are struck there and as he approaches, it happens that one  of the occupants is outside and sees him approaching. It is an Eskimo  dressed in rags and wearing an unmistakable air of dejection. Suddenly the  visitor recognizes the man and hails him, but is not answered.<br />The  visitor is Mowat and the Eskimo is Ohoto, a member of the Ihalmiut, one of  the People. The two have not set eyes on each other for more than ten  years. From that last meeting, looking backwards, Farley Mowat reconstructs  the life of this little-known inland tribe as they prepare, unknowingly, to  meet their doom. The story has grandeur as well as the appalling odour of  decay. It has the sensitivity to show us that the fragility of the Ihalmiut  may well turn out to be our own. It is also a finely written work, which  had me yearning for some of the places described within and it may affect  you that way too. At any rate, this second and perhaps final book about the  People is so plainly filled with human understanding that one has to be  very indifferent indeed, to take nothing from it.	2000-04-06

Firstly, it is about South Africa and, to the extent that outsiders know anything about that troubled country, it serves as a lesson to what the future might hold for any nation which falls into  the grip of a race war. From this point of view it is a very ugly novel.  Happily, it has some highly redeeming features which make us want to read  through all the trouble and strife. <br />Bryce Courtenay is a good writer. He  is able to involve us in the story from the beginning with well-drawn  characters. The central character starts the book off as a small boy,  living in South Africa during the Second World War. As if the black/white  race problems are not enough, we find out (those of us who didn't know)  that there is also extremely bad blood `twixt English and Boer. So when  young Peekay is sent to be the lone Englishman attending an Afrikaner  boarding school, he is really in hot water. Thus begins one of the most  unusual educations you could wish for and how Peekay eventually manages to  turn every disadvantage to his favour is part of the delight of this  chronicle.<br />Besides being a good yarn, this book has considerable depth  and we can follow Peekay quite closely as he learns all about Latin and  Greek, cacti, boxing and especially, human nature. By the age of twelve, he  is so well versed in these matters, not to mention the machinations of the  Pentecostal Church and the workings of the South African Prison system,  that he is clearly a boy apart, who may be destined for stranger things  still. <br />If you have the slightest interest in South Africa, you will  enjoy this book from many angles. It is a story about the twentieth century  and one of its most pressing problems, which we have now brought forward  into this one. In any case, most readers will have trouble putting it down,  as it is the story of an unusual life told with passion and honesty.	2000-04-06

Fervent admirers of the Abbey oeuvre will not have doubted this contention for a moment. For those who are only just coming across this rascally desert rat for the first time, I should perhaps  note that George Hayduke has appeared in a sister volume, the now infamous  \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang.\\" At the conclusion of that earlier work, George  Hayduke's fate seemed to be hanging rather desperately in the balance.  However, not even the untimely death of Edward Abbey, in March 1989, could  deprive us of all news of this most obstinate of heroes.<br />It would be an  easy thing to say that \\"Hayduke Lives!\\" is an unpolished novel. It does  seem to fall short of the demands which Abbey made of himself in \\"The  Fool's Progress,\\" the last volume he published prior to his death. Yet the  craft is certainly there and the willingness to create is as strong as  ever. Mountains motivated Edward Abbey; mountains and everything natural  (and even some things man-made, it has to be said) that lay around them.  His actual landscape at the last, which was also the landscape of \\"Hayduke  Lives!\\", was the canyon lands and desert country of Arizona and Utah (and  everywhere). So his imagery is likewise grandiose and well suited to the  theme of environmental vengeance which prods this plot along. Knowing  Abbey, one can sense that he is willing the earth itself to open up and  swallow the machines of man that make its surface tremble. Yet he contains  himself, just, to the story in hand and lets George do the dirty work in  his own inimitable style.<br />Abbey's long fight was unrelenting and  unapologetic. He seemed to sense that people need to be shocked awake in  order to react to the troubles of the world. Therefore his books have a  hard edge, and are often full of disagreeable people and unpleasant events.  His heroes are not pretty, they are bellicose and belligerent, and given to  much cussing and ill-talk. They bewail the fate of man and his planet in  new ways for us, like lonesome cowboys sitting up on far ridges crying to a  full moon. They are both modern, like the industrial society they do battle  with, and ancient, like the landscape which surrounds them and succors them  when they've lost their faith in man. Along with Callenbach and Mowat,  Edward Abbey surely takes his place in that wooded and hopefully sheltered  pantheon that has come down from Thoreau.et in  new ways for us, like lonesome cowboys sitting up on far ridges crying to a  full moon.

Nevertheless, it is a pleasure to be able to confirm the abilities of a truly great author. This example of his work is in some ways  a peculiar one since it was written during a turning point in modern  history, namely the Second World War, and was inevitably a turning point in  Miller's own life as well.<br />Henry Miller has not always had kind things to  say about his native U. S. A. Here, in \\"The Colossus of Maroussi,\\" he uses  the American state as a kind of false backdrop for his discoveries in  Greece. For Greece is the central geographical landscape on which he  builds. Far from being a travelogue, however, it is a story of that ancient  land and some of its people; Miller uses the fabric of Greek life to weave  a story of mankind.<br />His writing is distinctly dated today, but  delightfully so. It is full of a poetic imagery that is almost entirely  absent from the main stream of post-modern literature. As such, it is very  complex writing which occasionally seems to be almost self-serving, as if  the author was writing for no one but himself. In the main, it is a very  accessible book that tries to reach out in pure, non-political terms to  touch the essential core of what is man. At the present time, we could do  well to review our own situation in life, and one way of doing so is by  simply reviewing the literature on the subject. I recommend \\"The Colossus  of Maroussi\\" as a place to start. Besides being the work of a truly  formidable writer, it will take you to places you probably never dreamed  existed.	2000-04-05

First published in 1947 and available in a wide variety of editions since then, Farley Mowat's first and most distant book is still remarkably readable in the world of the 21st century.  It concerns one of the stranger human sagas of the last century, that of the discovery and destruction of a  remote Inuit society, the Ihalmiut, in Canada's north. The setting of the  book is far enough away in time for us to marvel at how little things have  changed since.  The contemptuous attitude of European man for the aborigine  seems hardly to have altered over the years.  We are still hard put to  understand the needs of the first peoples and how to answer them.<br />Farley  Mowat has combined a fine sensitivity for the natural environment with a  sharp eye for the details of man's place within it.  It must be exceedingly  rare in the history of anthropology that such an inexperienced investigator  has taken such pains to get to the source of his information.  Mowat lived  among the Ihalmiut for over a year to write the book.  During that time he  witnessed the rapid deterioration of the small group which remained, and  tried to examine the causes of their decline.  With very deft prose for  such a young writer, he points out the difference between the intentions  and the actions of the European discoverers of The People (as they refer to  themselves) and the consequences of such disparity.  The Ihalmiut were  exploited in much the same way as any other tribal band found wandering by  the early explorers.  However, as Mowat points out, this was an exceptional  group which had survived the extreme rigours of a barren land (known to us  simply as The Barrens) for so many generations, only to be felled by  contact with the very race which might have provided them with so much  assistance.<br />The Ihalmiut are long gone from their homeland but their  story serves to remind us of our often difficult relationship with the land  and the people on it.  Perhaps, as a race of city-dwellers, we need to  consider our place in the natural environment more than ever.  Mowat's work  is a just accounting of where we stand in relationship to nature.  Nor does  he suggest that we should all go and live in the tundra.  Yet People of the  Deer is a source of considerable inspiration for those now ready to reflect  on the unbalancing effect of contemporary values.ellers, we need to  consider our place in the natural environment more than ever.

She is (or was) apparently just as happy as I am about the fact that she is not a \\"real\\" historian. Of course the niceties of that argument may be fought  about for hours. But like Farley Mowat and T.C. Lethbridge, among others,  Tuchman is an attacking, uninhibited sort of individual who doesn't care a  fig for what a scholarly establishment may or may not think about a  particular subject (and like Mowat and Lethbridge, she gets away with it).  This is a very good beginning to a work about history which has to fall  into line with ten thousand others on the same subject (there may have been  more books written about the American Civil War, but I doubt it).<br />To tell  history in story form, and still have it remain non-fiction, is an art.  What to include? What to leave out? Why focus on this aspect, when so many  others are clamouring for our attention? Tuchman answers these and many  other questions even as she writes, by creating a panorama for us, so that  we may dwell on an individual aspect for a time, but not lose sight of the  whole. With this kind of confidence around, brought to bear by the sheer  mastery of the prose as well as understanding of the subject, writer and  reader get on very well together. Another Tuchman touch is to maintain  authorial integrity without annoying the hell out of us at the same time.  Even when she is commenting in no uncertain terms about a particular event,  we can accept it as reasoned and therefore coherent, rather than simply  intrusive or even sarcastic. She usually gets a laugh out of us - we both  know she's right - and goodness knows there is so much matter available, so  much silliness going on. <br />It's a book that is both easy to read, and  immensely pleasurable (even though it includes a grimness at times, that  one might expect), and it is difficult to see how you could come away from  it without a much better idea of why the guns of August spoke.	2000-04-02

It just seems to have everything, including Viking girth, humor and robustness. However, if your interest in the Vikings is only superficial,  and your mastery of English is not quite up to it, you won't read very far.  Gwyn Jones has written a densely-packed narrative (for, in spite of being  very much non-fiction, he manages to keep us in a narrative stream) which  requires only so many mouthfuls at a sitting. For my money, only the  experienced or very persistent reader of Norse history will get along with  this work, but oh what a ride he or she will have. Jones is, oh happy day,  the sort of writer whose scholarly leanings have not over-reached  themselves so far that he cannot take risks, sometimes in the most  delightful fashion. The text abounds in marvellous one-liners, so that it  is possible to imagine the writer acting the fool to some sixth century  prince of a Northern realm, and having to be very quick on his feet to stay  alive. There is much history here, no doubt, yet Jones has taken it and  presented it all with a very large grain of salt, such that I for one, am   very confident about the skipper on this particular voyage.

There is something  splendid about the British army maintaining its traditions in the heat and  dust of the Sudan. No wonder they were conquerors, for a time. If one could  put up with conditions like that, one could do just about anything in the  fighting way. <br />Perhaps the most remarkable thing to come out of this  book, is the way Kitchener planned his laborious advance, building the  railway as he went.

Certainly, when it came to Uncle Adolf's turn in 1940,  Churchill (as stated in his later memoirs) knew that once the U.S. came on  board with its unlimited industrial capacity, the war was as good as won.  It was just a question of tonnage, U-boats or no U-boats, blitz or no  blitz. So it was in the Sudan: the methodical Kitchener really never gave  the tribes a chance. <br />This is a book which can be read as history or as a  ripping good story. Fortunately for those of us who couldn't care a whit  for W.S.C.'s talent as a politician (though one cares somewhat more for his  talent as a statesman), his talent as a writer was never really in doubt,  as this second published work amply proves. Although I don't think it's  quite a five star book today, it would have been in 1896. Lastly, there are  some interesting subplots here, including some insight into how this part  of the world worked at all, up until the end of the last century. Even more  interesting possibly, is the story of Gordon of Khartoum, which is an  eccentric tale if ever there was one, and the relating of the Fashoda  incident gives us much insight into the workings of the political mind at a  time just prior to the formation of the various ententes, which were, in a  way, to have such a deadly effect two decades later. Most enjoyable read.	2000-04-02

For a start, Lewis had no right to survive the war over which he flew so many times, let alone live until 1993 or so,  and a very advanced age. Nor is it about the war we think we know  ourselves, down there in the awful trenches of the Somme. It is a silvery,  unreal sort of war, much of the time. A thread-like clinging to existence  pervades the story at times, as though Lewis knows, even years afterwards,  that he had been asking for too much, and having won it, should now keep a  low profile lest the fates remember him suddenly and deal him a mortal  blow. Just as our own knowledge of what really happened in that faraway war  is fairly murky (in spite of the immense amount of documentation), so  Lewis, coming back to it via his log books many years later, has no clear  memory of particular events. Just of flying, flying ever onwards, one  sortie after another, with the occasional scare marking the passing of  months, but little else. Except for the empty seats in the Mess, one  suspects that it was all fairly dreamy for this 18 or 19-year-old lad, of  whom much was indeed being asked too soon.<br />I enjoyed the book. I liked  its ups and downs. I was very impressed about finding such writing coming  from one who had every reason to shut up altogether, as so many of his  contemporaries did. It has been called (by whom? - Shaw perhaps) one of the  six best books to come out of World War I. I haven't read them all, but I'd  have to agree that it is a fine book, even though it shudders at times, on  the wing. It scarcely matters - what is good about it is in fact remarkable  - the poetry of the air, particularly. I'm just grateful that one who had  that very unique viewpoint, at a time when aircraft were going slow enough  for their human passengers to be able to think, survived to share it with  us. It couldn't have been written about any other period and, probably, by  any other writer. That may just make it unique.	2000-04-02

Combining the skills of seamanship, navigation and amateur  anthropology with those of the historian and trained scientist (he is a  biologist), this unique writer has brought a very fine light to bear in  this 1965 work which is just as relevant today as it was over 30 years  ago.<br />Amongst the more remarkable attributes of this lengthy examination  of the old Icelandic and Norwegian sagas, is the locating of the probable  sites for the major voyages of Eric the Red and Leif Ericsson and the  well-argued contention that neither of them was the first man to make a  documented voyage to the New World. According to Mowat, that honour goes to  the little-known Norwegian trader, Barnji Herjolfsson, who probably gave  Eric the Red his sailing directions.<br />Mowat doesn't take kindly to many  other conceptions about this period of Norse history and spends  considerable time debunking what he believes are myths created by scholars  who had no first-hand knowledge of either sailing or the particular  coastlines (Greenland, Newfoundland and Labrador) involved in the sagas.  Indeed, his close examination of the available descriptions serves to point  very much to the real sites as they might have been and show that many of  the old theories (particularly to do with New England) have no value at  all.<br />Sailing enthusiasts who love to read will come readily aboard this  vessel and perhaps pitch their own knowledge against or alongside Mowat and  the various Newfoundland schooner captains whom he interviewed to find out  their opinions about prevailing winds and currents. All in all, it's a  delightful book, not too difficult to read, even for non-nautical types  (Mowat chose to create quite a number of appendixes to hold all the very  detailed information and make the main text easier to read - they work verywell) and anyone even remotely interested in finding out who, as far as we  know, actually did discover America (or thinks they may have had Viking  ancestors), should pick this up. As an added bonus, if you enjoy this book,  there are several more by Mowat on the same theme, and dozens more by him  on a wide range of associated subjects (the Arctic, the environment,  sailing, whales etc.).	1998-12-10
