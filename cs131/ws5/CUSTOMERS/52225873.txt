The &quot;Quantitative Analysis&quot; course is an introductory course in statistics, with a focus on business applications. This text is perfect, as the examples used are directly relevant to businesspeople. There are also many questions and exercises, with the answers provided in the back of the book for all the odd-numbered questions. This allows students to practice and check their answers, while still allowing the professor to assign even-numbered questions as practice work to be checked by her later. The text starts with basic statistics, moves into probability, and continues all the way into multiple regression and non-parametric statistics. Real data sets are used liberally, and there are tutorials for SAS, SPSS, Minitab and ASP. Each section clearly defines critical terms offset from the body of the text, and the over 1000 exercises use data from real-world examples. Each chapter has exercises divided into &quot;Learning the Mechanics&quot; (straightforward applications of new concepts) and &quot;Applying the Concepts&quot; (applications of concepts to the solution of real-world problems). If you're a business student having difficulty with statistics, I'd recommend this book as an excellent primary or companion text.	2001-09-08

Starting with the foundations of the city and the Romulus and Remus myth, and continuing through the days of empire, the barbarian onslaught, the rise of the church, the medieval era, and the city in more modern times, he links location, biography and history in a way that continually excites.  Well illustrated, with maps, diagrams, paintings and photos, this book should be essential preparatory reading before visiting the Eternal City.  (For a modern guide including information on restaurants, etc, to act as a good counterpart to this historical book, I recommend looking at Let's Go Rome.  I used both these books on my two week trip in 1999, and didn't require any other references.)	2000-10-18

This book continues his excellence in the field.  His focus on marketing from a strategic management perspective would be sufficient to make this book worth the price.  However, he also includes significant sections on internet marketing, which add a tremendous amount of value for the modern manager or business student.  This is the core text for marketing in the Athabasca University distance MBA program.  Highly recommended.	2000-10-18

From the more conservative case-management approaches through the learning organization to the multiple-approach configuration school, they present business philosophy in a consistent and well-developed format.  Particularly valuable are the charts in the final sections of the book that compare the different schools, where they are most commonly found, and how to recognize them.  The perspective gained from considering ten different approaches to management is invaluable.  This book is a recommended reading in the Athabasca University (Canada) MBA program I am enrolled in, but it fact it has essentially summarized the content of the Strategic Management course entirely.  Highly recommended reading for any manager who would like a broader prespective on business strategy.	2000-09-29

He argues that the new Capitalism of the global economy  of change doesn't provide us with a satisfactory model for living.   Deeply-rooted core values like loyalty, sacrifice, authority, community,  and dependence on others are chipped away bit by bit through the actions,  attitudes, and machinations of the &quot;flexible corporation&quot;.   Loyalty is outmoded, generosity outdated, long-term vision outmaneuvered.   Drawing on his experiences, direct and indirect, with IBM, New York  advertising agencies, and the upper echelons of the Business elite, he  paints a disturbing and thought-provoking portrait of work gone awry.  In  his words, the critical question of character is &quot;Who needs me?&quot;   While this question may appear trite at first, consider how irrelevant it  is to the modern workplace, or even to society today.  Now consider how  relevant it should be.  Whether you agree with him or not, reading this  book will challenge you to clarify your own thoughts on what work means,  and should mean, both to the individual and to society as a whole.	2000-08-31

Instead, I was surprised to find that while it covered this  angle admirably, it was in actuality a travel book summarizing Selby's tour  of the Holy Land on her bicycle.  The stories she tells of her journey  really bring home the scale of human suffering caused by the conflict  between Israel and its neighbours.  The stories surrounding her travels  through the settlement camps in the occupied territories are particularly  moving.  I recommend this book for anyone interested in the Middle East,  peace and conflict studies, or for those who enjoy their travel books  written with a strong dose of reality by a razor-sharp wit.	2000-08-20

However, while the 20 volume set is  quite thorough, to say the least, it isn't the sort of thing you'd want to  keep on your desk at work.  (Unless you're employed as an English  professor.)  This &quot;Shorter&quot; two volume set is an excellent and  more compact version of the full dictionary.  While it lacks many of the  historical word usage references (try looking up &quot;apprehend&quot; in  the 20 volume set and compare it to this one, and you'll see what I mean),  it is more than adequate for almost anyone.  The thumb index tabs are very  useful, and the books are bound beautifully.  Along with the Oxford  Canadian Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, and Strunk and White's  &quot;Elements of Style&quot;, this dictionary is one of the core reference  books I use on a daily basis.  Certainly costlier than many dictionaries,  but in this case you really do get what you pay for.	2000-08-11

One of the positives about the book is that it  assumes people want their work, and the time they spend at work, to mean  something.  The dialogue in the book is based around this optimistic  foundation, and is refreshing reading for any individual or team working in  today's business world.  I recommend getting a copy for yourself, and  talking your manager into buying one for each member of your workplace.   The idea of shared values discussed in this quick read can strengthen the  bonds between members of a workgroup, and make work an enjoyable experience  rather than drudgery.	2000-08-10

Plus, every step is explained visually, right down to showing  which menu option to select, by showing the menu with the mouse hovering  over the correct option.  If you're looking for an in-depth description of  every command in Publisher 2000, this book shouldn't be your first choice.

Features are much easier to learn when presented visually.  I  didn't think full colour would have much of an impact, but it seems to make  commands easier to learn and remember.  I'd especially like to draw  attention to the way the guide shows the menus just as they appear, and  walks you through the menu selections with a picture for each menu option  you need to select.  No more &quot;Insert - Picture - Clipart&quot;.  Every  step is shown in full colour.  While this guide doesn't have every command  listed, it does provide people with the opportunity to learn the more  useful commands, like formatting tables, and including pictures with  documents.  If you're looking for a full reference of every command, this  book won't be for you.  However, if you want to learn the more useful  features of Word 2000 using an easy to understand step by step tutorial, I  highly recommend this book!	2000-08-08

While the guide thoroughly covers all of Italy, it doesn't do justice to a city like Rome.  (Nor should it be expected to...  that's what  Let's Go Rome is for!)  If you're planning to focus on cities like  Florence, Venice or Rome, make sure you bring along a guide specific to the  city if you're going to be spending more than a few days there.  The wealth  of information contained in these specialized city guides makes it worth  the extra cost.  If you're planning to see many cities on your trip to  Italy, and only have a day or two in each one, this might be the best guide  for you.  Either way, the Let's Go series is excellent!	2000-07-31

I've also had a chance to review this one.  I was quite happy with the recommendations of restaurants and sights.   Except for a single case, all the restaurants were enjoyable and  reasonably priced.  Make sure you go to Margutta Vegetariano RistorArte  (sic), close to the Spanish Steps.  This vegetarian restaurant has the most  stunning foor imaginable.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I could be after that  experience.  (And I'm not even being paid to say this!)  Just one of the  treasures the guidebook pointed out.  Also, if you're going for a week or  two, I'd stay in the city.  I spent four days in the Vatican Museum alone,  and saw about half of it.  There's more than enough to do and see without  spending your time on a train going somewhere else in Italy.  You might  want to save Florence, Venice and other cities for another trip!  I highly  recommend this book as a thorough guide to the city, rather than the 10  pages you'll find in some &quot;Visit Europe&quot; compendium.	2000-07-31

While the title of the review sounds a bit narrow in focus, you'll probably be spending most of your time in Italy doing one of these things - navigating or eating.  Don't even try going to a restaurant without a  phrasebook with a thorough section of food like this Berlitz guide has.   North Americans may think they have a grasp of Italian dishes, but go to  Italy and you'll find out how little we know!  I also brought along two  other phrasebooks.  One of them was written for British tourists, where  you'll find eggplant translated as aubergine, and all sorts of other lovely  surprises.  If you buy one of these phrasebooks, you'd better bring one  along that translates dialects of English.  :)  I highly recommend the  Berlitz book for its thoroughness and usefulness.

It was very useful for navigating through the city, and a wonder at restaurants.  Also, while many phrasebooks are similar, the Lonely Planet  phrasebooks are thoughtful enough to include phrases on sex (Was it good  for you?), common pickup lines (Do you come here often?) and polite  rejections for same (You're not my type.), and specific phrases for  technology issues (I'd like to surf the Internet), disabled people (Is  there wheelchair access?) and gay people (Where are the gay hangouts?).   There's also a section called &quot;Traveller's Latin&quot;, which will  help you translate all the inscriptions you find on arches and tombs.

A lot of the people who sit in churches and preach from pulpits have forgotten the kind of man Jesus was.  The man who loved the prostitutes, healed the sick on the Sabbath, and went on a rampage in the Temple isn't  the kind of person who would sit quietly by while gay and lesbian people  were beaten and hated.  Robert Goss recaptures the essence of Jesus in this  book - his love for the downtrodden and the fire for equality that burned  within him.  Based upon concepts of Liberation Theology, Goss studies the  language of hatred, violence against Gay and Lesbian people, coming out,  and the blessing of same-sex unions.  Interested yet?  How about the title  of one of the sections:  Deconstructing Biblical Terrorism. Or another: The  Politics of the Cross.  Anyone interested in Liberation Theology, Gay and  Lesbian studies, or issues around homophobia will find this book an  enlightening experience.	2000-06-30

I'm so impressed with this book I intend to purchase more in the series.  While it doesn't have the depth of a 400 page reference guide, I'm sure most people will be much happier with the results from it.  By being able  to see, in colour, exactly what you're supposed to be doing, you'll learn  things much faster.  The book even shows pictures of the menus, and which  option you need to choose in order to proceed with the desired function.  I  also liked the way the book picked the topics most people would want to  understand better about Frontpage.  Most people don't want to sell product  and track inventory from their personal website.  This book focuses on what  beginners want to be able to do.  For example, it shows you how to create a  home page, how to make navigation buttons appear on top and different  navigation buttons appear on the left of your page, and how to use photos  and other objects in your web page.  It also helps you understand the  built-in wizards, and how you can use them to create web pages simply and  quickly.  Highly recommended!	2000-06-30

This volume documents the history of the Gay and Lesbian movement from 1945-1990 in great detail.  From the initial grasping  at identity after WWII through the Mattachine Society and Stonewall, this  book tells the story of our struggle for freedom.  From the bashings  throughout the decades to the loving way our community cared for those with  AIDS, this book tells the story of our spirit.  Making History invites you  to meet the people who made us who we are today.  An example?  The  psychologist - Dr. Evelyn Hooker - challenged by her gay friend and student  Sammy to prove gay people were not ill.  At first hesitant, she picked up  the gauntlet, but hadn't finished her groundbreaking research before Sammy  died in a car accident in 1945.  These are just two of the many people in  this book.

The scholarship is, of course, thorough and brilliant, but the refined irony and humour found in her  &quot;Calamitous 14th Century&quot; is somewhat lacking.  (Of course,  practice does make perfect, and this is a fine early work.)<br />With this  said, her thorough coverage of the Balfour mandate starts not in the 19th  century, but far back in the past, even before Britain first began to  recognize the Christian debt to the Jews.  Starting in the Bronze age,  continuing through the Crusades, exploring Victorian ideals, and finishing  with a thorough review of the events leading up to the formation of Israel,  this book is nothing if not thorough.<br />For anyone who enjoys Tuchman's  work, this book is no disappointment.  For anyone curious about the  convoluted and intricate relationship between Britain and Palestine,  between Christian and Jew, this book is essential reading.	2000-06-21

(The first five books of the bible - the books of the law.)   According to Rosenberg, J, the brilliant woman writer and poet of Solomon's  court, most likely acted as mentor and mother-figure to the young male  prodigy S.  Many of the Psalms and stories of David seem to reverberate  with this close relationship.<br />As well, Rosenberg studies the indigenous  or &quot;Shamanistic&quot; nature of S's relationship with the land, as  reflected in his poetry, which provides new insight into the intense  yearning for Israel experienced by Jews through the ages.<br />I highly  recommend this book both for its scholarship and its artistic qualities.   Anyone with any interest in David, the Jewish experience, Biblical studies,  or poetry in general, will find this book a delight.	2000-06-21

Perhaps the highest example of a crumbling ideal - chivalry - he shows the  fatal flaws in an oppressive system beginning to decay before his birth,  leading to some of the greatest excesses within his lifetime, and finishing  with the fall of the French monarchy in the 18th century.  <br />Parts of  Tuchman's tale are more gripping than an adventure novel, more humourous  than a comedy, and more unbelievable than fiction.  In fact, her story is  so engaging because of its truth.<br />Anyone intersted in the Avignon Papacy,  the Great Schism in the Church, Popes and Antipopes, the Black Plague,  Feudalism, Protestantism, the persecution of witches and sorcery, the  prelude to the Renaissance, Italian banking, Antisemitism, and the Medieval  in general should adore it.  <br />I must admit, my jaw dropped several times  while reading this book, particularly during the chapters focusing on the  schism in the church.  It is not easy to escape the image of a furious Pope  screaming anathema and excommunication from the walls of the Castel  Sant'Angelo upon the beseigers below.  Unbelievable arrogance and  mercilessness seem the hallmark of the times, and Tuchman captures the  essence of these with great alacrity.<br />Following de Coucy lets us  experience life through the attitudes of someone placed firmly in the time.   While many of his attitudes may seem foreign to us, his more modern  qualities allow us to identify, if perhaps not sympathize, with him.<br />I  highly recommend this book both as an introduction to the study of the 14th  century, and as fascinating reading for anyone interested in the human  condition.	2000-05-16

The translation strives for both accuracy and clarity, and the result is a modern English translation that never stoops to colloquial  abstraction.  The short introductory essay provides a helpful start for  exploration of a complex work.  The index of proper names, and the glossary  (providing the translated Italian word beside the English) is thorough and  very useful.  In addition, the print quality of this book is delightful,  particularly the visually appealing layout and typesetting, which makes the  volume a pleasure to read, and a wonderful change from the paucity of  visual design that goes into many versions of classics.  This is a quality  edition you'll want to add to your library, in either the hardcover or  paperback versions.  Recommended for anyone who would like to broaden their  understanding of Machiavelli beyond The Prince.	1999-04-18
