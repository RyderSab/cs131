Maybe we could include Ann Coulter, <br />Rush Limbaugh, and Hannity also, but I am not sure if they are <br />screwing up America or if they are popular because America is <br />already screwed up.  One of the 100 is actually a group of people <br />he calls the Sex Warriors.  All of the women he quotes and their <br />ideas go back to the 70's.  If he wants to get retro, why not <br />bring up a group of people who believe that myth should be taught <br />as science and that we should have our educational standards set <br />accordingly.  (I am a Christian.  I believe God is the Creator. <br />But 6000 years ago!  Get serious).  And these ideas didn't fade <br />out in the 80's.  They are just as strong today.   <br /> <br />A large portion of his listed people are entertainers of some <br />sort, and unfortunately, that includes newscasters.  Entertainers <br />only have power over us if we decide to pay attention to them. <br />It's the politicos and the money men who have <br />the real power, whether we like it or not.   <br /> <br />I did agree with some of his choices, like gansta rappers, and <br />the Enron, Tyco, etc. guys, Jerry Springer, Howard Stern.  But <br />for the most part there is just a lot of liberal bashing, with <br />many examples of how the liberals hate the conservatives and <br />for that matter, how they hate America.  And while he is doing it, he uses a whole lot of name-calling himself.  Goldberg is <br />just about as fair and balanced as the Fox Network that uses <br />that phrase as their motto.  It doesn't fit either one.	2005-09-07

In my opinion, this is the best one of them all.  He has a lovely map on the end papers, he brings <br />Emerson and the Alcotts into the story, his townscape is enchanting, the colors once again provide the perfect feel to <br />the illustrations. <br /> <br />Johnson illustrative style is not like any other I have found. <br />And I am so grateful.  First, I don't think anyone could do it <br />better.  Second, I haven't gotten tired of it because no one <br />else is doing it.  Third, why hasn't this man won a Caldecott <br />yet?	2004-11-15

Unlike Mr. Artley and<BR>probably nearly all girls who live on farms today, my mother did<BR>not do chores connected with the farm. That was a guy-thing.<BR>Girls worked in the house. Period. But she certainly had<BR>brothers a-plenty who did those very same things in very similar<BR>ways as did Mr. Artley. The illustrations are wonderful,<BR>so realistic you can almost smell the hay, and other things<BR>not quite so fragrant connected with farms.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever lived on a farm, lived near a farm, driven by a farm. It is a document of<BR>a way of life that is swiftly leaving the scene, more's the<BR>pity. It should also be in school libraries. <BR>Even very young children can get a real sense of what it was like<BR>to live on a farm through the marvelous illustrations	2004-07-14

Probably both.  There is a tendency in everyone to abuse their power.  Unions were absolutely essential way back in the days when the robber barons had to answer to no one, including their workers and the government.  Unfortunatly, in the hey day of unions, they were nearly as abusive and destructive as were the capitalist barons of the previous era.<br />Then unions, many headed by thugs, priced their members out of a job, and now the power is back in the hands of the billionaire capitalists while the middle class is shrinking. Also, the<BR>the government is now, at least temporarily, in the hands of the party who believes that the government is for business, by business, of business rather than for the people, by the people, of the people.  Both of these things lead me to believe that<BR>the guy on tv (sorry, can't remember his name except that it was<BR>a Jewish one) is closer to the truth TODAY rather than Ms. <BR>Chavez.

But I am a collector<BR>of children's books and I collect with the quality of llustrations in mind.

It is a great coming together  of story, illustration, & printing that makes collecting children's books fun and satisfying.  <br />The illustrations are vivid, lush, and provide a real sense of<BR>place.

My problem with the book stems from the fact<BR>that the lesson to be learned comes from some sort of heroics on<BR>the sissy duck's part.  <br />Within my extended family and within the family of my best friend<BR>there are kids who are very different - one physically, one<BR>mentally.  The chances of their doing something really heroic is<BR>as slim as it is for the rest of us.

Everything is black and white.  And her side of course is white.<BR>What she never acknowledges, at least in print, is what feminists have done for the good of women (which I really don't think is that important to her as long as she is doing well), the good of families, and of our society.<br />She is not alone in blaming all of the ills on the world on<BR>feminists, but in my era (which is roughly hers, though I'm somewhat younger) she was the pre-eminent one and from which everyone else took their cues. <br />Some of the things that have taken place since the era of <BR>feminism - 1960's and on:  We can expect the police to come if<BR>there is domestic violence; a rape victim can take the perpetrator to trial even if her life has not been perfect; she can get a job without being asked if she is married, or engaged, or taking birth control, ( and trust me, you younger readers, this was standard procedure back when I was starting out, as was lower pay even for very trackable jobs like teaching the same subject in the same town at the same grade level), you can now get your own credit card and your bank loans under the same conditions as men, you can make the decision on whether you<BR>will use birth control rather than your doctor whose sensibilities may not be the same (or as one doctor told my<BR>sister, &quot;but you only have two children so far; the answer is<BR>no.&quot;)  I can guarantee you that Schlafly did not fight any of<br />those battles.  She was too busy telling OTHER women to get back<BR>into the home during her high-profile, often-away-from home<BR>career.<br />Schlafy declares that by mid-1980's radical feminism was over,<BR>and she cites women who say &quot;all I want is a husband&quot; and things<BR>of nature.  Actually, I think that nothing is more telling of<BR>victory.  If you asked any of those women if they would like to<BR>go back to any of the situations mentioned above, there would<BR>be a resounding &quot;no.&quot;  Yes of course they want a husband and<BR>probably kids too.  15 years into the revolution they have<BR>forgotten or are too young to realize the battles that had to<BR>be fought on their behalf.<br />The bottom line for Schafley and her ilk is that women's value<BR>lies in the home.  And for those who are not married or are<BR>widowed or the children are grown are essentially people who<BR>can be sacrificed for the good of the idea.  Never mind that <BR>that group of people is now  over half of us. Never mind those <br />who aren't part of  any of that group but who break out in a sweat every time the insurance bill or the utilities bill arrives or who have to say no to piano lessons or swimming lessons or even a movie because there is no money.  Never mind that at no time in the history of either the U.S. or the world have we had anything like a perfect world.  We have always had problems and will continue to have them until the end of time. If you think that until the 2nd half of last century, kids' lot was pretty much like &quot;Little House on the Prairie,&quot; you might read some of the social history of 18th and 19th C. Great Britain. The horrors<BR>were not limited to Great Britain, but the Brits  seemed to be particularly adept at writing about them. <br />Think about it - if everything was so wonderful, why did we have this huge social revolution in the 60's and 70's.   Was it because we women were selfish, terrible people.  Or was it because there were people out there (Schlafly included) who <br />knew what was best for the rest of the world.  Something like,<BR>you may be equal in the sight of God, but you ain't equal here.<br />I've worked all of my adult life (except for 4 years when <BR>we were moving from place to place because of my husband's job).<BR>My children are all grown, never any trouble with the law,<BR>all except one out of four were honor students in high school,<BR>and all are college graduates orstudents, one is an-ex marine.<BR>No one is on the dole, all attend church, there are no illigitmate babies, no shacking up.  We are a very close knit family that gets together every Sunday for dinner<BR>along with the spouses and the kids.  What went wrong!  How<BR>can this be!  Maybe the answers are not quite so simple as<BR>Ms. Schlafly would like to imply.	2004-02-09

I have never actually read anything by this author before, but I know she is in the romance genre, which I do not read.  But this has to be the bottom of the barrel even for this genre.  <br />Everyone is gorgeous, a fact that we are told nearly every time a particular character comes onto the scene; everyone is<BR>highly successful; even though Maria had been fat, she lost 38<BR>pounds in 3 months, and kept it off (everyone who has had that experience, please raise your hand!), a feud that broke up the<BR>friendship of the four women seven years previous was mended<BR>after a bitchy screaming match that lasted about 15 minutes and<BR>then they all became great pals again.  <br />I often had the impression that this book was written primarily<BR>for 1) money, and 2) to show off the knowledge of Ms. Bradford<BR>in all things &quot;cultured&quot; from clothes to art to cuisine to wine.<BR>Unfortunately Ms. Bradford does not believe that her readership<BR>are members of the culturally elite because she finds it necessary to explain to them (for instance) who Gainsborough and Turner are.

We have for too long given our total<BR>unwavering support to the Israeli regime and it really needs to<BR>stop.  That idea has always fallen on deaf ears and even more<BR>so since 9/11.  But there is a very legitimate reason why the<BR>Palestinians (both Muslim and Christian) are angry.  Their land<BR>was taken away from them with the stroke of a United Nations<BR>pen.  (I think we can all agree that this would not happen today).  The land of Israel came about because of the West's <BR>sympathy for what the Jews went through during WWII, and it<BR>certainly was horrible.  We also felt guilt about coming in so<BR>late to their aid, and perhaps rightly so though I am assuming<BR>that we really had no idea of the magnitude of what was going on.<br />Sennott points out what has happened since then.  As a journalist<BR>he had been to Israel on many occasions, but he concentrates on the Year 2000, the time of the new Millennium &amp; the time that the Pope made his historic journey to Jerusalem.  According to <BR>Sennott, opportunities were lost because the Pope was so <BR>determined to atone for the Catholic Church's lack of concern<BR>for the Jews during WWII, that he did not address the plight of<BR>the Christians in that land today while he was there, much to<BR>their great disappointment.<br />Sennott points out that Fundamentalist Christians are the Jews <BR>strongest allies, due to &quot;last days&quot; prophecies in the Bible. (I am not quite sure why the Fundamentalists are so sure that we <BR>are now in the &quot;last days,&quot; but perhaps they know God's time<BR>table better than I.) He also points out that very few of them are aware that there are many Christians among the Palestinians and they are being driven out just as surely as are the Muslims.  <br />What Sennott most clearly does is to show how time after time<BR>the Israelis treat the Palestinians as second-class citizens,<BR>which they in fact are.  The Israelis tell them where they can<BR>live, where they can send their children to school, where they<BR>can work.  They can forbid all of the above when they choose.<BR>They have confiscated Palestinian land, both in general and with individual properties, while at the same time demanding that the property stolen from them during the war should be returned to them.  And we continue to give our support in part because they are a &quot;democracy&quot; within a sea of non-democratic societies.  <br />Sennott's emphasis is on the Christian Palestinians, but he also<BR>points out that what has happened to the Christian Palestinians<BR>has happened to almost everyone in Israel who is not a Jew.<br />For a number of reasons, some of which would sound bigoted,<BR>Sennott's side of the story gets no air time and very little<BR>press.  This is most unfortunate, particularly now when times<BR>are so volatile.  If we hear only one side of the story, nothing<BR>is ever going to change.<br />So that people who read this review don't get the wrong idea,<BR>Sennott does not appear to be solely out to make a case against<BR>Israel, but rather that the &quot;other&quot; side gets an opportunity<BR>to be heard.	2003-12-16

Not only do I think that such a book is important but Hague also happens to be one of my favorite illustrators.  So on breaks at work I would read it.  It is not all that I had hoped it would be,  but it is good. <BR> <BR>However, Bennett's bias politically drives me nuts which has made<BR>me biased against purchasing this book.   Added to that, his<BR>decision to not only preach against sin but to name the names of<BR>the sinners (in another venue) makes him something less than an<BR>effective moralist and something more like just another loud-mouthed commentator on tv.   And then to put the nail in the coffin, there is the recent revelation of his own particular downfall (gambling).   Talk about people who live in glass houses!!<br />None of my own biases against this man has to do with the intrinsic value or lack thereof of the book.  But, I have decided that I would find someone more personally worthy of informing me and my grandchild about virtues.	2003-09-10

The plot was the kind I like, with a nice<BR>Agatha Christie type venue &amp; almost no violence.  But my one<BR>ongoing annoyance with the book (I haven't read any others in<BR>this series) was the boyfriend.  Somehow he didn't fit in,<BR>&amp; I would have much preferred to have more of the women in the<BR>book club (who seem to almost disappear) and less of the boyfriend who was as unappealing as he believed himself to be.	2003-06-08

US	52621016	R3RPWE6TJSCAQI	0684825546	688704432	Zorba the Greek	Books	2	12	48	N	N	A big disappointment	In preparing for a trip to Greece, I decided to read some novels<BR>of Greek origin.  I think perhaps this book is too dated to<BR>get the feel of present day Greece, at least for those areas where I will be going, but that was not the big problem.  The book is about a self-absorbed lecherous hedonist (am I being redundant here?) that for the most part is utterly boring.  One of Zorba's oft repeated ideas is that, while he didn't believe in God, if such an entity did exist the only reason why he would condemn a man to hell was if the  man did not bed all the women <BR>who wanted bedding.  And of course, there was the assumption (repeated ad nauseum) that woman's primary source of joy and <BR>solace is to be bedded.   I don't know about God, but this woman would be more likely to condemn a man to hell if he didn't help out around the house. Self-proclaimed &quot;God's gifts to women&quot; are nearly as boring in literature as they are in real life.  The advantage of<BR>the literary type is that you can get rid of them in a moment's notice by just closing the book.<br />The reason for the 2nd star is for the fact that the author does<BR>have some literary talent.	2003-04-23
US	52621016	R2J8HHP709QE6T	1556524323	397985120	The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations	Books	4	9	14	N	N	A FUN BOOK, BUT WITH THE SLANT TILTED THE WRONG WAY	I would imagine that this book was written primarily for movie<BR>lovers who love a movie so much that they would like to see the<BR>place where it was filmed and walk the streets that the stars<BR>had walked.  At least, the indexing would indicate this.  <BR>The entries are listed by movie, rather than by location.<br />However, I am a traveller.  And the information that I seek is<BR>to find a movie that will show the scenery of a place that I have<BR>been or will be going to soon or to which I take a fantasy <BR>journey.  This book does a pretty good job of relating, <BR>indirectly, how much of the landscape you can expect to see, by<BR>telling just what locations are used.  Some of them are really<BR>very sparse.  <br />What I am still waiting for is a book which will rate the movie<BR>by use of landscape, along with other things such as culture<BR>and cuisine,things that might really give you a feel for the country <BR>or the region or the state or the city that is being <BR>filmed.  One that I expect would fit the bill is &quot;Frida&quot; <BR>but this book was written before the release of the movie, so I<BR>am trying to get feedback elsewhere.  One of my favorite travelogue <BR>movies (it hits nearly every major tourist spot in Rome)is <BR>&quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; But if the movie is mentioned in this book,<BR> I could not find it.  Also missing - &quot;Tea with<BR>Mousellini.&quot;  I am passionate about Italy.  I resent absences<BR>in this category.<br />So, I gave this book 4 stars because I think that it has <BR>accomplished quite well what it set out to do.  However, for<BR>my own personal usage, I would give it only 3.	2003-03-23

And I am going to presume<BR>that this &quot;award-winning journalist&quot; did her homework well<BR>enough so that I was informed, rather than misinformed, about<BR>life, customs, and culture of Biblical times.  However, time and<BR>again I wanted to throw this book down in disgust. I could find<BR>this kind of writing on the daily soaps.  One of the first clues<BR>I ever learned about whether a piece of work was soap opera or<BR>not is this sentence - &quot;I am going to have your baby.&quot; In the <BR>real world, we say &quot;I am pregnant,&quot; &quot;I am going to have a baby,&quot;<BR>&quot;We are going to have a baby.&quot;  In this book - &quot;I am going to have your baby.&quot;  I should have taken my clue then.<br />I found enough references to body parts and bodily functions<BR>to last a life time.  I have come to learn that Ms.Diamant's<BR>favorite word must be blood, in its various forms and meanings,<BR>because it is on nearly every page once the book gets going.<BR>But I would say that the worst is the romanticizing of the<BR>plight of women under subjugation.<br />If all of the above is what you like, then this is definitely<BR>the book for you. Until I saw the review just previous to mine<BR>I despaired for finding nothing but rave reviews for something<BR>so &quot;not literature.&quot;  I'll bet Diamant could write a really<BR>fine book if she set her mind and talents to it.  I hope next<BR>time she tries it.	2002-06-17

I really enjoyed<BR>most of the book.  It lived up to its billing.  The dust jacket<BR>calls it \\"a big, dramatic novel - roaringly human, comic, serious.  It is about war, love, laughter, and intrigue....\\"<BR>While this description was a bit overblown, it was close enough.<br />In a book that is largely comedic, you expect to have to overlook<BR>certain things.  In this case, it is the rather outrageous<BR>stereotypes of both the Italians and the Germans.  I happen to<BR>be of German descent, so I could have worked up a beef about<BR>this aspect.  But comedy usually depends on exaggeration.  So be<BR>it.  <br />What caused my anger was the end of the book.  I wanted a funny<BR>book, I wanted a heroic book.  And in the end I was given <BR>the very worst in people - murder, knifing an unfaithful girlfriend, torture, misguided honor.  If I want to learn about these things, I can pick up the newspaper, I can watch the endless cable tv \\"justice\\" programs on people who make misery in this world.  Perhaps I would not have been so sensitive<BR>to this before 9/11.  But I certainly am now.  I don't want to<BR>see the mean side of people coupled with comedy in any shape or<BR>form.  Not ever.  And if someone can actually put the two together and make some meaning of it all, find some salvation in it all, this author did not do it.	2002-04-06

His father, the wolf, dies when WF is still cave-bound.<BR>Much description is written about WF's feelings for his mother (intense devotion) and the world around him as he begins to explore it.  Along the way, by trial and error, he becomes a wily hunter &amp; survivor.<br />He and his mother Kiche are eventually taken in by a group of<BR>Indians and Gray Beaver becomes his master/god.  He trains <BR>WF to be one of his sled dogs and a hunter. The way he trains<BR>him is with ferocious beatings any time WF disobeys or slacks off<BR>or does anything wrong.  WF sees him as a god.  Not one that he<BR>loves, but one he must obey to avoid beatings and to receive<BR>food.<br />Gray Beaver eventually sells him to another god, Beauty Smith,<BR>who is truly evil.  Beauty is training WF to be a fighter dog,<BR>and his beatings are even more ferocious.  WF is pitted against<BR>other dogs on a daily basis, while his master takes bets.  WF <BR>never looses.  Then one day, WF is pitted against a bull dog.<BR>The fight is like none he had ever experienced before, and it<BR>is one that almost cost him his life.<br />It is through the fight with the bull dog that WF comes to know<BR>his newest and last master/god, Weedon Scott.  And it is<BR>through Weedon that WF learns how to love his god.  And in the<BR>end, love is rewarded on both sides.<br />It is a book that would be most appealing to the intermediate<BR>reader and young adult, especially adventuring types, and animal<BR>lovers.  The edition I read was from the Whole Story Series<BR>and their additions to each of the books they publish are very<BR>noteworthy.  Besides the complete text of the original book<BR>they also include many photos, illustrations, and enlightening<BR>notes about the history, culture, etc. of the place &amp; era. Even if a person is not crazy about the story (&amp; WF in not my &quot;type&quot; of story,) the information in the margin alone is worth the reading.	2001-10-10

US	52621016	R3RZOQZ8X6H79W	0786117710	870015800	The Tunnel of Love	Books	4	11	11	N	N	A BLAST FROM THE PAST	Tunnel of Love was first written in 1949 and is in several ways dated - women wear gloves, the men wear homburgs, the cocktail hour is firmly in place.  As I was reading this witty, urbane story, I could very easily envision it on a 1940's/1950's movie screen, with Cary Grant &amp; David Niven.  But the themes and messages are timeless. <br />The narrator who is a magazine art editor and given to wise- cracking is also in the embarrassing position of having to reject his neighbor &amp; best friend's work.  He also becomes entangled in the same friend's messy amorous affairs, and once or twice tries to have an affair himself without much luck.<br />The plot thickens as friend Augie and his wife decide to adopt a child.  The narrator does not see Augie as real parent material, but in spite of that has agreed to give a recommendation to the adoption agency.  When he is interviewed by the agency, he loses his voice.  The couple are rejected by the first agency, they go to another with no luck, so they return to the first.  They finally receive the baby of their  dreams, but shortly afterwards Augie's wife Isolde learns of Augie's past affairs and kicks him out of the house.  They do get back together again in &quot;happy ending&quot; style.<br />Author Peter de Vries, who often wrote for &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; condemns gently.  There is a definite recognition of the turmoil and hurt that bad behavior causes, but de Vries also sees people as very human and more often in need of persuasion &amp; understand- ing than in need of a swat over the head with a baseball bat. Add to the mix his wry humor and you have a really enjoyable &amp; wonderful book.	2001-08-20

It really needs a pronunciation guide.  Even adults will have difficulty pronouncing some of the unfamiliar animals' names. That said, all else is wonderful.  The illustrations give a real feel for the forest habitat and its inhabitants.  The story  line describes typical activities of the various animals.  It is like watching a PBS documentary on wildlife!  In the back of the book there is a globe of the world, with the appropriate area spotlighted, and a one page blurb about the Virunga Mountains  which is directed towards adults.  Then there is a beautiful four page spread of the rain forest.  On the fold-over pages to the four page spread are 32 different illustrations of plants and animals that live in the forest.  A beautiful &amp; informative book.  I am eager to also read the other books in this series.	2001-06-07

I have been buying cookbooks for 30  years and I know I should  have been more careful up front.   BUT there are two huge problems with  this cookbook.  The first - the recipes for one pound loaves are almost  non-existent.  Presently, I have only a 1 pound machine.  I am planning to  buy a new machine, and it will probably be bigger, but in a two-person  household, I don't need more than one pound loaves except on special  occasions.  I doubt that I am the rare exception here.<br />The second problem  - even more irritating than the first - the index is inadequate. I wanted  to make a bread with coconut.  I looked up in the  Recipe Index to find  recipes with coconut in it.  All I found was &quot;Coconut Milk White  Bread.&quot;   Then I went to the General Index which gave me a page  number. &quot;Toasted Coconut Bread&quot; was there.  I suspect that I was  really being directed to information about coconut rather than to a recipe  including coconut as one of its main ingredients. &quot;Hawaiian Sweet  Loaf&quot; was not listed in either place.<br />My experience with other  ingredients was the same.  For aniseed I could find &quot;Anise Christmas  Bread&quot; but not &quot;Moroccan Bread with Sesame and Aniseed.&quot;  I  love macadamia nuts, but could find no recipes listed under that entry.  I  did, however, find two recipes that have the nuts in it.<br />The three stars  I did give to this book are for the breadth of it.  There is a wonderful  assortment here.  Just wish they were in one-pound recipes so I could try  them.  There are great appendices also.<br />It almost makes me weep that a  book so grand is also so unusable for me.  Maybe in the next edition they  will get it really right.	2000-08-14

I do most of my &quot;reading&quot; on audio cassettes because I have a long commute each day.  Not only did I love this poignant love  story, and the author's superb way with words, but the reader, David  Rintoul, gave one of the best readings I have ever heard. He captured the  ache, the passion, the delight, the stuffiness, the ordinariness of Norris.  And each of the other characters, with their <br />wonderfully distinctive  accents, came very much  alive for me.  I felt as though I knew each one of  them by mid-book.  <br />I have &quot;re-visited&quot; the village and its  folk twice now, and probably will again.  I will be very much disappointed  if there is not another Norris/Vida/ Manford novel.  And if there is one, I  do hope Rintoul will be the reader.  There can be no better one!	2000-05-12
