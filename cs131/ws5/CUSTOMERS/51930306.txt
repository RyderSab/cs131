Peter Levi does a wonderful job following the poetry and language of Shakespeare as it develops over his lifetime, in the context of the other writers of his era.  Harold Bloom, of course, finds in Shakespeare both a mirror and an impulse for a leap forward in literature and therefore in society.  Bloom has fallen in love with certain of Shakespeare's characters (Falstaff, Hamlet, etc.) and uses them as a yardstick for all others.   <br /> <br />Asimov takes a more historical view.  He has done impressive research into the characters and times.  His \\"Guide to Shakespeare\\" is useful for its insights into all of the plays, but I found it most useful for the English histories.  In the eight plays of the Wars of the Roses --from Richard II, through the Henrys, and culminating in Richard III--  Asimov tracks the family trees and politics of the nobility, spots anachronisms, and does a wonderful job of simplifying the sometimes bewildering array of characters and historical references.  Of course, even uneducated audiences in Shakespeare's day would have understood some of these arcane references without a guidebook, much as a modern US audience would easily understand references to Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln.  With his research and clear writing, Asimov brings the history plays --and indeed all of the plays-- back to life.	2005-06-04

The only reason Detective Milo Sturgis is along is to provide a foil for Delaware's powerful intellect and psychological acumen.  Here's Delaware explaining to the experienced detective how men eat in prison.  Here he is schooling Sturgis in proper interrogation techniques, or helping Sturgis to run down leads.  Author Kellerman is a psychologist himself, so it must have been an attractive affectation to develop a psychologist character who can solve crimes.  But it doesn't really work.  He should have made Delaware a full-time detective, since that's what he has evolved into -- an LAPD detective with a background in psychology.<br /><br />Yet, while \\"Therapy\\" strains credibility, it's still kind of fun. Kellerman's prose is well-crafted.  He can write, but sometimes one wishes he would plot better.  Delaware's character is out-of-place and the novel's twist (some wacko stuff about Rwanda and snipers) is half-baked and feels like even the author got bored halfway through, but it's still a fun read.  I don't think Kellerman's work is of a quality that one needs to bother reading all his books, but if you find this one in the airport lounge, well, you could do worse.	2005-05-16

They take as their inspiration the notion by economist John Kenneth Galbreath that convenient answers, those that seem to make sense at first glance, often crumble under greater scrutiny.  Thus the book's mission is to look more closely at some conventional assumptions.<br /><br />Levitt raises provocative ideas, notably the one that has won the greatest press attention: that the legalization of abortion in the U.S. in the 1970s --and the consequent reduction in the number of unwanted children who would have grown up in troubled environments-- was the single most important factor in the dramatic fall in the US crime rate in the mid-1990s, when those kids would have become young adults.  It is more important, Levitt suggests after viewing the regression analysis, than even community policing, handgun laws, or the expanding economy.  Interesting, provocative, and right on-point to a major issue of the day.<br /><br />But the more interesting chapters are the last two, dealing with child-rearing.  Levitt looks at reasons why some kids are more successful than others:  he examines the effect of schools, race, names, parents' education, and the programs and events that \\"obsessive parents\\" pack into their youngsters' lives.  His conclusion?  Having educated concerned parents is more important to early success than anything else.  Or as Levitt notes, \\"What parents are is more important than what they do.\\"<br /><br />The book is a light read, quick and accessible, but it intentionally avoids detailed discussion of the underlying data, so it is impossible to replicate or criticize the conclusions from a scientific standpoint.  But that's okay.  It's a pop book designed to stimulate discussion rather than an academic paper.  It's not exactly revolutionary, but it's fun and interesting.	2005-05-14

It's a good read, but won't be of much interest to a non-baseball fan.  Bissinger clearly read Daniel Okrent's \\"Nine Innings\\" before he sat down to write, for Okrent's book is a detailed look at a single 1982 game, with analysis of personalities, baseball lore, tactics, and psychology sprinkled in as the game goes along.  Fortunately, and unlike \\"Nine Innings\\", this book lets a few pitches go by in the name of a smooth and lively narrative.  So readers don't get bogged down in too many details but can get through the three-game series in 250 pages.  Bissinger clearly knows his audience, since the Cardinals big year wasn't 2003 and the season covered by this narrative, but rather 2004 when the team went to the World Series.  So the author apends a few pages at the end describing the fates of some of the key players and the 2004 season -- certain to satisfy any Cardinal fan.<br /><br />The most interesting sections are the discussions of the personalities of the players.  Even La Russa, driven and manic and oblivious to the damage he is doing to his own marriage, is not quite as interesting as some of the athletes.  There is Cal Eldred's journey from New York phenomenon to effective elder statesman; there is Kerry Robinson, who over-estimates his own talents and squeaks by with the occasional ability to have startling success; there is Yoda-like pitching coach Dave Duncan; the frustrating wasted talents of JD Drew and Garret Stephenson.  And of course, there is the great Albert Pujols, with a talent so majestic and sublime that he may eventually rank among the handful of greatest players ever.<br /><br />\\"3 Nights in August\\" is a fun read for baseball fans, and particularly Cardinal fans.  Bissinger is a bit rah-rah in his devotion to La Russa, who paid him to write this book, but the cheering --like the book-- is all in fun.cheering --like the book-- is all in fun.	2005-04-09

British spy David Jardine saves the world by stopping a couple of disaffected spies --Israeli and Russian-- who turned to large-scale financial fraud.  The plot is pretty good, as Jardine runs around in Beirut and Moscow and New York and lots of moving parts and loose threads get neatly tied up in the end.  The problem is that Smith sometimes gets out ahead of himself and loses touch with reality.  He uses all the old tried and true catch-phrases --writing about the \\"spy game\\" (can you imagine any spy calling it that? ) and calling the CIA \\"the Company\\".  He also has some research breakdowns, saying \\"the Croatian Army\\" shelled Dubrovnik when it was the Serbs; having Led Zeppelin blaring during the 1968 Tet Offensive (Led Zep's first album came out in 1969).  Just small stuff like that to make you feel like the author was just sort of wingin' it.  He also tries too hard with the protagonist, David Jardine, who is alternately world-weary, a one-man army, a fantastic lover, a quoter of Shakespeare, getting too old for the \\"spy game\\", more clever by half than his bosses... well, you get the picture.  Finally, the author, a British military man by background, stumbles when he tries to use American dialect and phrases, with the result being an odd mixture of British-Americanisms that makes you feel like you're watching an Austin Powers movie.<br /><br />Not really a bad book, just sort of hastily written. Par for the course for the espionage genre, a good read but not lasting litereature.<br /><br />Not sure why Amazon insists on listing the author as \\"Tom\\" Smith.  Hello !!

My first objection is just a pet peeve.  The authors have that strange affectation you hear sometimes from people tryin' to fancy up their vocabulary:  they use the word \\"monies\\" all the time when they mean \\"money\\".  Granted, that's just me, but the repeated use of a gimmicky word made the whole book feel sort of cheesy.<br /><br />My other complaints are substantive.  The book is really designed for folks with bad credit or other \\"qualification hurdles\\".  There's a whole chapter on \\"If You Don't Fit the Mold\\", i.e., if you don't qualify for ordinary mortgages and have to be a bit more creative.  Plus this same material is repeated in most of the other chapters as well.  Fair enough, I'm sure lots of folks out there have credit \\"hurdles\\" and need some good advice.  But by reaching for this niche market, the authors have made a choice to include 20 or 30 pages that aren't useful to the majority of home-buyers who do Fit the Mold.  I riffed through all this extraneous material but was disappointed to find there simply wasn't much of use to me.<br /><br />When I was looking for real, concrete tips, I found little more than bland generalizations.  With the complicated and articulated mortgage market these days, it would be great to get some advice on how to identify, solicit, and sift through all the dozens or hundreds of mortgage lenders out there.  Instead, Chapter 2 merely tells me that there are several types of lenders out there (um, yes, I could tell that by the several types of spam that hit my e-mail account every day), and that I should interview lenders before selecting one.  Well, that's not real helpful.<br /><br />The book feels hastily-written.  The authors seem competent.  They eagerly explain all about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and try, in their haphazard way, to describe some of the details of the loan process.  But at the end of the book, I still have dozens of unanswered questions about my own case.<br /><br />My recommendation:  take a pass on this book.  A better and more informative buy is Ilyce Glink's \\"100 Questions Every First-Time Home Buyer Should Ask\\".  Glink provides more comprehensive, more recent, and more useful information, as well as websites and other background materials.ns of unanswered questions about my own case. <br /> <br />My recommendation:  take a pass on this book.

The Pecota projections give a sense of how the player might perform THIS year, and whether he's more likely to improve or decline from last year.  The little analytical paragraph on each player is priceless, and often very funny.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are a couple of problems...<br />The first is the authors' theological insistence on not allowing the stats for Runs Scored, RBIs, Wins-Losses, or Saves to show up anywhere.  We all get it, these stats are problematic and subjective and don't always reveal the true contribution of a player to his team.  But hey, those are all stats that every single fantasy league in the country counts.  So the tens of thousands of guys with fantasy teams who are looking for some insights into some of the key statistical categories will be disappointed.  This book, open alongside of the Bill James Handbook, should give you all the data you need.<br /><br />The second problem is really about the format.  The Bill James Handbook lists all the players alphabetically, and that makes sense for fantasy coaches.  The Baseball Prospectus, however, lists the players by team.  But even where a player has changed teams and the authors note that fact, the Prospectus insists on listing him with his old team.<br /><br />I think the Bill James Handbook --because it uses the stats and format most convenient to fantasy owners-- will be a better buy if you're only getting one book.  Fantasy owners are less interested in the collection of talent on any particular real-life team than in being able to assess the whole universe of players.  So the Bill James book is better-suited to fantasy owners.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Prospectus --because it groups players by team and doesn't bother with some of the key fantasy stats-- is probably more suited to the guy watching a game on TV who wants to read about the specific players on one team.  The Prospectus's statistical analysis showing the value of a particular player to the team and park he plays for, and vice versa, also support the notion that this book is better-suited to someone focused on one team or game.<br /><br />In short, both books have strengths and weakneeses.  I bought them both and enjoy them side-by-side.  But it depends on what is your primary interest.owing the value of a particular player to the team and park he plays for, and vice versa, also support the notion that this book is better-suited to someone focused on one team or game.

Milwaukee against Baltimore.  Nothing to set it apart from the other dozen games played that day, but Okrent breaks it down so we can watch the strategies play out.  Righty versus lefty, old hand versus young kid.  A nice slow-paced trip through nine innings.  More, he looks at the bigger picture.  The background of each player, coach, and executive on the teams.  How they got to where they were in June 1982.<br /><br />It's a nice book, and if you remember those teams, with Ripken and Ted Simmons and a young Robin Yount, then it's fun to go back and see them again in action.  But while the book is ostensibly about baseball, or rather Baseball, in a timeless and transcendent way, it does suffer from being... dated.  It's been over 20 years since this game was played, all the players are long gone.  It's interesting as far as it goes, but it would be even more interesting if there were an updated edition.  Maybe a game from 1998 or something, so we could relate a bit more to the players, issues, and controversies of the day.  In fact, it would be interesting if Okrent or a copycat would write a new edition of this book every generation, and the resulting series would be a wonderful history of what changes --and doesn't-- in the game over time.<br /><br />This is a nice book.  As slow but interesting as the game itself.	2005-03-11

The author seems to wear his own preconceptions a little too close to the surface when he repeatedly reveals his own latent racism and fear of the poor.

Forsyth is a good writer, able to pace a story, but he is better in the longer formats.  Short stories by any author often feel contrived and forced, and these are no exception.

In the final pages we finally learn about Jack's career move --though the answer is given away by the book's title-- and this is something he has fretted over for several books now.  But many other plot threads remain hanging, most notably that of Stephen's marital status.  The previous book involved the sudden, unexpected and unmourned deaths of several key characters, and this one leaves a dozen or two other secondary characters wholly unfinished.  It feels as though the elderly O'Brian had meant to write another book or two to bring Aubrey and Maturin back to England for the final denouement, but perhaps his energy failed him.<br /><br />In any case, this is another excellent story.  With Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo, the \\"Surprise\\" must refit after suffering damage in a collision before making her way on her long-delayed voyage to Chile.  The action and intrigue in Portugal and Chile are wonderful.  As always, Stephen Maturin's wry humor, brought out by the author's sublime prose, leaves the reader smiling.

Whatever.  He does it again in this book, so you'll have to skip past that.  The book doubled as the exhibit catalog for a showing of Watterson's works at Ohio State a few years ago.  The interesting pages are dozens of Sunday strips with his personal comments under most of them.  They appear in both the original draft and the final colored form (though personally, I didn't see much value added in running the same strip twice --in black-and-white and then in color).

I take the point of some reviewers that they could have done with a few more maps and a bit more historical and technical material instead of the plot summaries, but I disagree.  Because I chose not to rush through the series in a couple of months, but instead read them slowly over several years, I enjoyed going back and reading through the summaries before I began each installment.  \\"Harbors and High Seas\\"  added immeasurably to my enjoyment of the Aubrey/Maturin series.

It's certainly not a revelation that Macbeth was influenced by the Gunpowder Plot and King James' interest in the occult, but Wills' exploration goes deeper.  His point of departure is the well-known difficulty in staging Macbeth, a play that bounces from the witch-infested battlefield to an intensely private murder and the interplay between Macbeth and his wife.  But all of that is finished a third of the way through the play, to be followed by seemingly disjointed scenes with Malcolm in England, with Hecate and the witches, and other bits that many modern productions simply omit.<br /><br />Wills argues that the environment in England after the 1605 Gunpowder Plot --an attempt by a band of Jesuits to blow up the King, the crown prince, all the senior judges and the entire Parliament-- was not unlike the grave national mood in the US after Pearl Harbor (or perhaps after 9-11, one might add).  Macbeth was written the following year, and, Wills believes, is one of many \\"Gunpowder\\" plays that showed the Jesuits as satanic, clever liars who made pacts with the devil and sought to overturn the natural political order.  In this context, the witch scenes in the play, as well as several other scenes (the porter pretending to be Hell's gatekeeper, Malcolm's verbal testing of Macduff in England) take on a new light.  They are not extraneous to the closet murder story, but are themselves key to understanding Macbeth's motives.  Macbeth was seduced by the devil and eventually becomes a witch himself.

True to form, the \\"Yellow Admiral\\" finds Captain Jack and sidekick Stephen Maturin on shore in England, where they have domestic troubles, win and lose their fortunes, and finally set to sea in the Bellona.  Assigned to duty on the blockade of the French city of Brest, Jack Aubrey manages to capture a French privateer while Stephen carries out his usual intelligence activities after a nighttime landing in France.  But peace breaks out.  Napoleon is defeated on the continent and exiled to Elba, meaning that the British Navy will be demobilized and Jack's prospects for promotion to Rear Admiral are diminished.  Just as Jack and Stephen are about to set sail for an intelligence mission in Chile, word comes that Napoleon is again on the loose.  A cliffhanger ending that builds towards Napoleon's last hurrah --the Hundred Days.  O'Brian's prose is as spare and intelligent as ever.  The Yellow Admiral is a wonderful book.	2004-11-14

The first part of the book is taken up with their shore visits, something we haven't seen in several volumes.  These turn out to be bittersweet, as Sophie and Jack have a spat and Stephen's home life is even more confused.  When they finally set to sea, Jack is the commodore of a squadron with a double-mission: to interdict the slave trade off the African coast and then to confront one of Napoleon's invasion fleets.<br /><br />As always, O'Brian serves up nautical detail, a wry sense of humor, deeply developed characters, and minimalist prose.  \\"The Commodore\\", like the first sixteen volumes in this series, is simply excellent.	2004-11-06

Books	1	16	69	N	Y	Unbalanced Little Pamphlet	This pamphlet makes up with fire-n-brimstone passion what it lacks in cogent arguments.  If you're already a gun-nut, this piece will give you some one-liners to use in chat room debates.  If you're undecided on the issue of handgun regulation and looking for thoughtful arguments, it won't be your best source.  It's not balanced, and it doesn't pretend to be, but it's pretty entertaining.  Crime statistics are fumbled, court decisions are misinterpreted, history is wrapped around the axle.  You get a sense of the author's agenda from the subtitle:  \\"What the American aristocracy (sic) Doesn't Want You To Know\\".  It comes across as one of those militia tracts downloaded from wacky websites -- everything is a conspiracy.  The government, academics, newspapers, business owners, everyone is involved in some murky plot (with motives unexplained) to deny the author and his sympathizers what they believe is a constitutional right (and he even asserts as a \\"natural right\\") to own firearms.  Lots of kooky fantasies are stuffed into the poor overburdened twenty-seven words of the Second Amendment.  The world is full of Elite Rulers and Oligarchs and whatnot.  Unsourced, poorly edited (there is a strange recurring fetish to put certain words \\"in quotations\\" for no clear reason, such as \\"the people\\", \\"scholars\\", and \\"court decisions\\"), and internally contradictory in its arguments (should we look to the text of the constitution for our guidance or to supporting materials or to interpretive court cases?  Well, it depends on which one supports the author's views the best).  Guaranteed to raise a smile.	2004-11-05
US	51930306	R5WT0GXCY2RU2	0156029588	735890843	The Flanders Panel	Books	4	1	2	N	Y	Interesting Premise	In modern Madrid, Julia the art restorer prepares a Flemish masterpiece for auction.  The painting depicts two men playing chess, watched by a woman in black.  But beneath the varnish lies a hidden message alluding to the centuries'-old murder of one of the chess players.  Julia brings historians and chess experts into the mix trying to unravel the old mystery, but sets off a new round of murders and thefts.  It's an interesting plot device, that the real chess game depicted in a classic painting would yield clues to both the old and the new murders.  Perez-Reverte is a good writer, though he tends to over-write by repeating the same idea three or four times in a paragraph or explaining at length what is blindingly obvious.  Other reviewers have noted that the chess game itself is not expert-level and that it makes the plot drag a bit.  Fair enough.  Readers who played chess in high school will be able to follow the game.<br /><br />One quibble:  even though the painting and the artist in question are fictional, it would have been useful to have a reproduction of whatever painting the author referred to as he wrote the book.  Maybe a reproduction on the cover. It's a fun book, an easy read.  A definite cut above the typical mystery dreck available these days.	2004-10-09

But, of course, it is far more than a typical romantic comedy.  Shakespeare ostensibly intended to write about the complicated theme of exterior versus interior.  The value of gold and money against the value of friendship and loyalty.  Shylock, the Jewish moneylender is portrayed as greedy and more concerned about his money than he is about his own daughter.<br /><br />But modern readers have a hard time sympathizing with Antonio the Merchant and his superficial and hateful friends, Bassanio, Gratiano, et al.  They are racist, quick to judge, wasteful, and unconcerned about others. They are delighted to treat Shylock like a dog and to invent phony excuses for their own nasty behavior.  Shylock is no innocent victim.  Indeed, he brings about his own ruin.  But in a play whose key passage is Portia's courtroom discourse on the quality of mercy, mercy and justice are hard to find in any character.  Shakespeare's language is as powerful as ever in this play, but the unlikeable Shylock and the venom doled out to him by his sordid persecutors makes this play a stomach-churning challenge.	2004-09-27

That's something of a stretch, as he's more akin to James Michener, turning out a series of overlong, overwritten, and lightweight page-turners with more physical than literary weight.  \\"Dona Flor\\" was made into a top-rated Brazilian soap opera, and that's about how one should approach it as literature -- fun, sexy, sweaty, and improbable -- for those who prefer their novels sunny-side-up.<br /><br />Dona Flor is a modest woman whose bon vivant husband dies suddenly, leaving her to marry a staid suitor who doesn't quite satisfy her desires.  Her passion brings the ghost of her first husband back into her bed.  Hijinks follow.  A fun read, over 600 pages in this edition, so if you choose to pick it up, you'll be stuck with it for a while.	2004-09-26

Perez-Reverte has done his homework and packs in lots of fun nautical and historical details.  Lovers of sea stories will enjoy.  He's an intelligent writer and doesn't underestimate his reader.  On the other hand, the prose tends to be a bit flabby.  With long paragraphs in which, quite literally, the same sentence can be rephrased and repeated three or four times.  Ideas (particularly about the personalities of the main characters and about the sea) can be repackaged and rewritten a half a dozen times.  The author (or translator) has inexplicably fallen in love with the word \\"chimera\\", using it over and over.  The writing is often self-conscious, and late in the book, the \\"narrator\\" suddenly introduces himself and interferes in the plot, though he admits that he knew nothing about the characters and didn't meet them until late in the game -- making a reader wonder how he knew the information he ostensibly narrates early on.  The characters, despite the long passages devoted to drawing them out, still come across as a bit thin and undeveloped.  The reason is that they aren't exposed to many different situations, so readers can't see how they respond to the range of experiences in a real person's life.  Finally, the ending is a bit of a disappointment.  Predictable --no twists here-- and over in a flash.<br /><br />So, this is hardly the perfect novel, but it's fun and engaging and written for the educated reader.	2004-09-16

Because of his reputation as a first-class story-teller, over the years, an entire industry developed creating, rewriting, and embellishing Lincoln stories.  In putting together this collection, Zall has endeavored to select stories that Lincoln himself told, even when he himself took them from earlier sources.  This is not a joke book, but a collection of colorful, and mostly clean, jokes and anecdotes.  Together they offer a glimpse into the psyche of an interesting man who was a master in using simple humor to political purpose.	2004-08-26

William Marlowe is a professor of Shakespeare at Columbia University, with a wife named Anne and a couple of kids.  While immersed in a seminar on the sonnets, he meets a Dark Lady and a handsome and pale young man.  Hijinks follow in New York City.  Readers of Shakespeare will recognize the parallels with Shakespeare's own life.  Professor Marlowe unselfconsciously, in both senses, follows the trajectory of the narrative of the sonnets.

Well, it's really just bad in one way... it's badly written.  The conceit is that it is a confessional Shakespeare wrote in his final years, so it is written in this precious pseudo-Shakespeare jargon that comes across as creepy and convoluted.  Probably will be unintelligible to someone who doesn't enjoy Shakespeare, but then, someone who does enjoy Shakespeare wouldn't waste time on a book that can't get out of its own way.  There are plenty of fun, and well-written, novels and stories set in the Shakespearean era.  No need to waste time on this one.	2004-08-16

The curator of the Louvre is murdered and intrepid Harvard scholar Robert Langdon (you met him in Brown's last book) meets up with another European girl (this time she's French instead of Italian).  Hijinks follow.  The historical research is wide, without ever being deep. But it adds a fun veneer of deep mystical somesuch to the plot. Leonardo da Vinci, secret Vatican cabals, Opus Dei, mystical this-and-that.  It makes for a fun read.<br />As other critics have pointed out, the facts of the book are often muddled and inaccurate, suggesting the research may have been done by one of those credulous sorts who always believes the last thing he reads. The characters are paper-thin cutouts, mere devices who grab hold of the plot early on and cling to it for dear life. The dialogue is silly and predictable. The author's irritating penchant for hanging on to clues and half-clues, doling them out slowly is a device of the B-grade pop mystery novel.  Like its predecesors, this book is sort of a middleweight version of Umberto Eco's towering novels.  Not too challenging, but it keeps the pop public entranced, sells a bunch of copies, and lets us all feel like we're initiates into some secret society. Bravo -- a lot of fun !	2004-07-18

Well, I'm convinced.  Grisham can write.  He can put together dialogue and local color that's not in a Chicago courthouse, and he can pace a slow story with an evolving plot.  &quot;A Painted House&quot; is sort of a Steinbeck tale, following a rural Arkansas farm family for a few months in 1952 as they pick their cotton crop, endure the elements, and move among their neighbors and hired hands.  It's a nice story, dark and sometimes forbidding, but always inviting.  Seven year-old Luke's yearning for matinee cowboy movies and a red Cardinals baseball jacket ring true and bring a smile.  Grisham's attention to detail, the small-town gossip, the back-lot garden, the annual ballgame, all create a deep and satisfying rural tale.  It's not real Steinbeck, but it's not bad, and it's a huge step up for Grisham.	2004-07-13

She was delighted in 1981 when Ronald Reagan selected her husband, Jim Brady, as his Press Secretary.  But she admits she was in over her head, wearing the wrong clothes and star-gazing at Washington's elite.  Within three months, the dream was over.  Jim Brady was gravely injured during the March 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan.  Sarah Brady's life changed and she became a passionate advocate for sensible gun laws.  Her hard work and name were instrumental in passing two laws over the objections of the NRA:  the Brady Law that mandated a waiting period for handgun purchases, and the Assault Rifle Ban.<br />For those interested in the give-and-take of the firearms battles in Washington, the book may drift a bit too often into asides about Jim's medical difficulties or the doings of a family maid or longtime friend, while not revealing all you might wish to know about the legislative tussles.

In the end, the personal material reveals Mrs. Brady as a compassionate, strong woman who struggles with family, trauma, and self-doubt, and earns her every victory.

But, despite the fact that this book is a 1992 reprint, it will be a tough and largely academic read for all but the most hard-core baseball or Angell fans.  It chronicles the 1977-1981 seasons:  an era of Reggie Jackson, George Brett, and Tom Seaver; an era when newly-won free agency brought gasps with contracts worth half a million dollars.<br />Those days are long gone.

But this, the fifteenth in the brilliant twenty-volume series by Patrick O'Brian, is not the strongest of the bunch.  It is different from the others in that there are no scenes of naval warfare and only a trivial, and somewhat belabored, battle for a Polynesian island.  The true action lies in the long voyage across the Pacific with a young woman stowaway.  Clarissa's own personality is quirky and shaped by a childhood of abuse, which causes no end of consequences on a ship of men starved for female companionship.  Jack and Stephen, as always, deliver wonderful dialogue and a subtle interplay.  Jack's shipboard authority and management style offer a different side fo the man.  Patrick O'Brian could write.  Even when he wasn't at his best, he could write.  Five stars for The Truelove.	2004-03-22
US	51930306	R134WH9I2PR0MJ	0345367650	641383212	Polar Star	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Excellent Sequel	The second in Martin Cruz Smith's wonderful Russian-themed detective series, Polar Star lives up to the promise of the first book, Gorky Park.  Polar Star is a Russian fishing ship off the coast of Alaska, working in conjunction with a team of US trawlers.  Moscow detective Arkady Renko is being rehabilited after the events in Gorky Park and finds himself on board when a murder takes place.  The setting, on a freezing fishing ship in the icy Bering Sea, lends a heavy pressurized feeling to every page.  Smith has done the research, his writing is self-assured but not self-conscious.  He doesn't show off, but casts plot and dialogue and characters and scenery with the true ring of authenticity.  Renko's self-deprecating honesty and Columbo-like detective style brings a smile.  Smith is a good writer and this is a good book.	2004-03-08

Smith's writing rises far above the typical spy / thriller genre.  His characters are fully developed, flawed and nuanced.  The dialogue is wonderful, down to Renko's self-effacing honesty and Irina's protective lies.  Moscow detective Renko is heroic in a underdog sort of way.  Here he confronts Russian mobsters in Moscow and Germany after the murder of an underworld financier and a fellow cop.  It's simply good writing, good research, and a good plot.  And Arkady's fans will be happy to see Irina again.	2004-02-28

It turned out to be a pretty good --if overlong-- read.  The title refers not only to the court case that forms the core of the book: a defense attorney's attempt to get a condemned man off death row where he was sent for a triple homicide a decade earlier.  It also refers to the lives of the protagonists:  the judge in the original case returning from her own setbacks and unhappy past, and the prosecutor and detective who are trying to salvage their reputations and put past mistakes to bed.<br />The characters are surprisingly nuanced, the dialogue credible.  Sometimes the characters tendency to engage in internal dialogue gets a bit tiresome and as a result, the book runs 550 pages in the paperback edition.  But it's a good book, better than your average legal thriller.	2004-02-10

Arkady Renko is a Soviet cop called in to solve a triple murder, with the bodies left under the snow in a Moscow park.  As he probes deeper, he bumps into the KGB, a wealthy American fur trader, and a high-level conspiracy dating back to World War II.  Cruz Smith spent eight years writing the text, and it shows.  The eye for detail, the Moscow street scenes, the historical research and the multi-layered characters all feel first-hand and urgent.

US	51930306	R1EHNELSC1N5H8	1566630568	733206591	Shakespeare	Books	5	16	17	N	Y	Fresh and Engaging	Anthony Burgess, perhaps best known as author of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", wrote this engaging biography of Shakespeare in 1970.  As more than one critic has noted, all the Shakespeare biographies that have come out over the centuries are bound by one common thread:  they all must work from the same finite set of information.  Much is known about Shakespeare, but much is not known.  And what is known grows no larger.  We know a bit about his Stratford origins, his move to London, his life and business, and his brief retirement back home.  And of course, we have Shakespeare's writings.  Or as Burgess puts it, \\"Infuriatingly, whenever Shakespeare does something other than buy a lease or write a play, history shuts her jaws with a snap.\\"<br />The challenge to a biographer is to present the material in such a way as to be informative to those who've never read a biography, interesting to those who have, and true to the set of known facts.  Burgess meets the challenge and then some  -- Burgess was, of course, a fine writer, and he was also an erudite scholar and a fan, though a sharp-eyed one, of his subject.  Careful to qualify his guesswork, he jumps to many credible and a few incredible though amusing conclusions --for example about Shakespeare's family and home life-- that set a fertile context for the known facts.  Burgess has done his homework on the royals and nobles in Britain, describing the climate change after Elizabeth's death, Southampton's eclipse and Essex's treason.  He has read the contemporaries, Marlow and Jonson and Philip Sidney (who wrote of writer's block: \\"Thus, great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes, Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite; 'Fool,' said my Muse to me, 'look in the heart, and write.'\\")<br />The analysis of the plays is strong (particularly the flesh vs. gold themes in \\"Merchant\\", not new yet well put).  And the final lines are wonderful, the Shakespeare-as-us theme written so as to leave us with a smile.  Burgess was a true writer, and his biography of Shakespeare has the virtue of being fresh and witty and insightful, it stands out from the others.was a true writer, and his biography of Shakespeare has the virtue of being fresh and witty and insightful, it stands out from the others.	2004-01-17

He offers a surprisingly complimentary view of President Bush, sketching him as decisive, even if not always sure what he is being decisive about.  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld is depicted as screechy and infantile -- territorial to a fault (once churlishly refusing to offer Air Force One a military escort until a few minutes before takeoff).  NSA Condi Rice is conciliatory --personally the closest to Bush, but this book suggests that she probably deserves some of the criticisms she receives in the press for being unable to control a cabinet full of loose cannons and huge egos.  Secretary of State Colin Powell takes his lumps from Bush and the rest of the cabinet.  His moderation and diplomatic skills are viewed with suspicion by Bush as well as war-hawks Cheney and Rumsfeld, and they often drop leaks to the press and work behind his back to undermine and embarrass him.<br />Woodward got good access to people and documents, and the fact that Bush gave him lengthy and private interviews probably accounts for the book's kid-glove treatment of the president.  That was likely Bush's strategy in giving the interviews:  co-opt Woodward into saying nice things.  The book does provide some useful chronological accounting, from the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US to the December 7 final victory in Afghanistan.  There are details of conversations and White House meetings among the administration principals as the anti-Taliban and Osama strategy took shape and played out.  There is also some 'epilogue' material on the rush to war in Iraq that emphasizes the precarious position of Powell in the policy-making process.  A good book, interesting without being groundbreaking.	2004-01-10

The 1994 Penguin Popular Classic edition is interesting because it includes twenty-two pages of introductory material about Shakespeare, his times, and the play itself, all written by an unnamed editor who uses the first-person and discusses editorial choices made in this version.  The editor emphasizes the fact that there are weaknesses and holes in the text, caused by Shakespeare's writing on a short deadline in 1606 and by the fact that later editors and actors and compilers probably cut-and-pasted large sections.  The result, counsels the editor, is that some scenes (including Hecat's speech in III-v, and the witches' appearance in IV-i) is &quot;probably not by Shakespeare&quot;.<br />This is rather a large leap.  It may be true, but we have no way to know for sure.  Other credible scholars (Levi, Bloom) note that these sections are unique, but do not aver that they are not by Shakespeare.  In any event, it is rather interesting that this editor devotes so much space to this notion, and misses the opportunity to discuss other --more important-- elements of the play, such as the subtle poetry of Macbeth's speeches, the &quot;post-Christian&quot; religious significance, the blood-darkness-water themes, the parallels to Lear, or the political connections between Scottish Thanes and British Earls.<br />Another quibble is with the notes:  all the text notes and vocabulary are at the end of the book, so an interested reader is constantly riffling back and forth.  Penguin should have followed Folger's admirable lead and put the text notes on the same pages as the text itself.	2004-01-04

His work contains seeds of typical Latin magic realism, but it is also unique to Brazil and to Scliar's own heritage.  &quot;The Gods of Raquel&quot; is a quick read, 107 pages in this edition, that tracks the coming-of-age of a young Jewish girl in southern Brazil:  her struggles with her religious identity create conflicts with her parents, lead to an affair and ultimately a transfiguration with a man who may either be a lunatic or divinely inspired.  It's a mildly interesting book for its questions about religious confusion, but is ultimately unmemorable.  The linear plot feels a bit contrived and predictable -as most magic realist works do.  Not a bad way to spend an afternoon, but not a towering work of Brazilian literature.	2004-01-03

The war was not nearly as one-sided as it might seem on first glance, for at the time, Paraguay's army was larger than its combined enemies.  Paraguay struck first, invading Brazil and Argentina, but was ultimately beaten back and ground down.  By war's end in 1870, Paraguay had lost huge tracts of territory, its President and its entire army, and an astonishing 60 percent of its population.<br />Leuchars' account of the war is well-documented and readable.  The opening chapters analyze the political climate in each country.  Paraguay's erratic dictator, Francisco Solano Lopez, is generally blamed for the war.  He had a large army (70,000 strong), a shrewd sense of military tactics, and he enjoyed a fanatical devotion from the public, yet his strategic aims were never clear --we simply do not know what Lopez hoped to get out of the war.  Argentina's President Mitre was a modernizer who presided over an unstable country still gripped by conflict over whether to be a centralized or federated state.  Brazilian Emperor Pedro II, also a modernizer, similarly faced challenges from regional warlords, as well as slavery and a shockingly unequal distribution of land and income.  Uruguay was in the throes of civil war between its modernizing Colorado and oligarchic Blanco parties.  Against this backdrop, Paraguay's Lopez deserves most --but not all-- of the blame for the war.  The conflict began when the various countries took different sides in Uruguay's civil war, but that was quickly subsumed by each country's territorial aspirations rooted in the region's still-unfixed borders.<br />Leuchars does an excellent job of sorting out the motives of each government and reexamining established historical conclusions.  The maps are frequent and excellent.  The &quot;big picture&quot; analysis of the war's impact on the region, and particularly on Paraguay's future, is persuasive.  Ultimately, Paraguay's population was reduced to 125,000, less than half of its prewar number through military losses and the extreme hardship endured by the citizens.  Brazil lost an estimated 100,000 troops and civilians and Argentina another 25,000.  These numbers, given the rural nature of the societies, are unimaginable in today's wars.<br />&quot;To The Bitter End&quot; is timely.  There is simply not much recent writing in English about the War of the Triple Alliance.  And apart from Paraguay, where the consequences remain an indelible part of the national character, it is a war in danger of being forgotten even in South America.

In this book Wills does not reach the profound insights found in his longer works on the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address, nor does he try to.  Instead he describes the aging Jefferson's artistic vision and his determination to found a seat of higher learning -an academic village in central Virginia- to compete with Harvard and Princeton and the other northern schools.  Jefferson was challenged, notes Wills, by religious disputes in Virginia, financial limitations from the state legislature, and petty jealousies among the state's small elite.  Relying on guidance from various architects and planners, Jefferson laid out the grounds and designed the buildings while fighting continuous political battles over funding and staff.<br />This little book can be read in an afternoon, but it provides wonderful detail to the academic and architectural legacy of Thomas Jefferson.  The only failing is the shortage of illustrations -photos and architectural sketches.  If a dozen more photos of the site were included, it would be a perfect book for Jefferson fans.	2003-12-22

From Pericles to Aegospotami, the Peloponnesian War matched the Spartan and Athenian empires in twenty-seven years of unrelenting struggle in the fifth century BC.  Kagan does a good job of recounting the events, but the book is far from an unqualified success.  Among the high points are the excellent maps --two dozen of them sprinkled liberally through the text showing key battlefields from Sicily to Asia Minor.  Kagan does not make the typical scholar's mistake of forgetting maps.  The prose is simple and clear, with periodic references to source material (mostly Thucydides), but without cryptic footnotes or other academic fetishes.  The narrative smoothly makes sense of complicated events, referring to alternative theories, and offering sensible explanations for controversial decisions by generals and rulers.  Descriptions of leading Athenians like Alcibiades and Pericles (who noted the four characteristics necessary to a statesman: &quot;To know what must be done and to be able to explain it; to love one's country; and to be incorruptible.&quot;) are nuanced and interesting.<br />On the other hand, there are two related downsides to the book.  First, in a text aimed at an audience unfamiliar with ancient Greece, it does a surprisingly poor job of describing anything BUT the war.  In addition to the maps, Kagan could usefully have sprinkled short &quot;box texts&quot; throughout to describe items of interest such as the  culture and architecture of the Greeks, their lifestyles, food, population, and economy.  Further, in a 500-page book about a war --predominantly a naval war--  it is disappointing to find no description of the weapons used, tactics employed, and especially the workings of the trireme ship with which Athens ruled the seas.  Further, nine-tenths of the work is based on Athenian sources and is heavily Athens-centric.  Presumably this is because there are simply fewer good sources about Sparta and the other cities, but a reader never has any idea about how life and society in those cities functioned.<br />Ultimately, these failures make the book a tough slog.  Halfway through, it becomes little more than a tedious chronological march to war's end.  Dates and names and battles pile up until, abruptly, the Battle of Aegospotami brings the text to a quick end.  But long before, this reader was struggling with the decision of whether to plod forward.  The author could usefully have trimmed about a hundred pages (though no doubt he felt he edited mercilessly to bring the book in at 500 pages), and added about fifty pages of background material on Greek society.  Finally, the book needs a &quot;big picture&quot; conclusion.  Readers are periodically assured that the war had a huge impact on the ancient world, and presumably on the course of history.  Yet these ideas are not drawn out in the six-page conclusion, but only hinted at.

The book provides background on the movement and seeks to illustrate the conflicts it caused by giving a blow-by-blow account of a dispute in the Morro neighborhood of Recife, a poor city on Brazil's northeastern coast.  However, the best sections are the introductory chapters (1 and 2), the conclusion (6), and the endnotes, where readers will find useful history, insightful analysis, and well-written prose.  On the other hand, the book's centerpiece, the chapters (3-5) about the Morro neighborhood, are uninteresting.<br />Liberation Theology wasn't quite born in Recife, but some of its best-known proponents were there.  It thrived there because of the region's impoverished feudalistic society, rooted in centuries of sugar culture and patron-client &quot;colonelism&quot;.  Liberationism's roots are in the &quot;Catholic Action Groups&quot; of  the 1940s that were precursors to &quot;Ecclesial Base Communities&quot; (CEBs): the tens of thousands of bible study groups with overt political agendas organized throughout Brazil's vast northeast by leftist clerics.  This approach to community organization was endorsed by Vatican II in 1965.  Liberationist leaders and their allies in Recife, including Bishop Dom Helder Camera, pedagogue Paulo Freire, Peasant League leader Francisco Juliao, and Governor Miguel Arraes were exiled in the 1960s after a military dictatorship seized power in Brazil.  It was this charged political environment, not unlike those in much of Latin America, that allowed the movement to thrive.<br />Liberation Theology was not simply politics hijacking religion, as some critics charge.  Its adherents were truly people of god for whom &quot;activism and politics were not inimical to church teaching but rather a way of expressing one's faith.  Jesus himself sought to overthrow a corrupt government, they pointed out, thus signaling God's approval of similar work.&quot;  But ultimately the movement faded, and Nagle's insight is that this was a function of the movement itself, that Liberationists &quot;wanted to move quickly to address poverty, using the Church as a vehicle.  They sought to modernize the Church too fast and link it to political causes.&quot;  Thus, she holds, it failed after the dictatorships and political crises that sustained it were resolved, principally because it never put down deep roots in the Catholic communities nor did it embrace the reasons why miserable people took solace in the Church.  Its messages were often more reflective of its educated leaders than the peasants; and it failed to appreciate the weight of Catholic tradition on the congregation.  In short, it addressed people's worldly needs but not their spiritual needs.  In 1984, the Vatican formally condemned liberation theology.<br />For all of its weaknesses, the movement was not an utter failure.  Times and circumstances changed, but Liberationism was instrumental in energizing thousands of activists in Brazil.  People who became involved in politics and took control over pieces of their own lives.  They were key to the founding of the Workers' Party, to the peaceful end of the military regime, and to the  election of Lula da Silva in 2002 as Brazil's first working-class President.  Liberationism, and the network of CEBs, have exerted a powerful influence on modern Brazil.<br />All of these interesting insights can be found without reading the central chapters on the struggles in the Morro neighborhood between conservative Bishop Dom Jose Cardoso and Liberationist priest Reginaldo Veloso.  For the record, Dom Jose fired Reginaldo in 1990, using police to face down unhappy residents and install his own parish priest.  This tale was probably gripping to someone who lived there, but to an outsider it comes across as mere small town gossip.  It doesn't really live up to the author's thesis that it is a window on the larger debate.  Sections of Nagle's book are a fascinating success.  This is not the final word on Liberationism, but it's a useful introduction.t really live up to the author's thesis that it is a window on the larger debate.

It's not a bad book, just a bit overwritten in that hyper-enthusiastic way of first novelists.  Soares has done his research on Sarah Bernhardt, Sherlock Holmes, and the emperor's court in 1886 Rio de Janeiro.  He's crafted a reasonably well-structured novel and thought through the different pieces of the plot so that they fit together at the edges.  The problems, of course, are with the greatest challenges for fiction writers:  character and dialogue, and &quot;Sherlock&quot; fails at both.  The characters are all buffoons, every one of them.  This makes for some lighthearted humor at the characters' own expense, but it also means that in the end none of them have any depth or nuance.  They are just cardboard caricatures that the author has set up in order to knock them down, mere plot devices.  Similarly, the dialogue is cute and sometimes clever, but never really deep or revealing of subtlety.  Finally, the research itself sometimes gets in the way as the author fills pages of text with details culled from history books that do not drive the story forward but only distract a reader's attention and break the spell of the story.  &quot;Sherlock&quot; is a fair novel, a good first attempt.  I may pick up another Jo Soares novel in the future, but I won't run breathlessly to the bookstore to find it.	2003-10-28

Just the name causes dread among those who have any idea what it is.  Preston has traced the four strains of Ebola (three of them intensely fatal to humans) to their source in the Great Lakes region of central Africa --the same area that gave birth to the AIDS virus.  He has done his homework, chronicling the periodic outbreaks, including one in a monkey research center in Virginia in 1989.  Ebola's gruesome symptoms and high mortality rate mean that it does not reside naturally in human hosts, but lurks in some other -as yet unidentified- host species in Africa.  It could be living peacefully in elephants or lizards, and then periodically it crosses species and creates horrifying killer epidemics.  It never goes away, it just goes back into hiding.  Preston demonstrates that Ebola is both capable of becoming airborne (i.e. can be transmitted in the breath of a victim) and of killing humans quickly.  There is nothing to say that its next mutation -perhaps next year- won't wipe out 90% of human life.  Ouch.<br />A terrifying page-turner.  Even at 400 pages in the paperback edition, you'll read it in a weekend.	2003-09-21

The Roles of Planter and Slave in a Plantation Society (Studies in Moral, Political, and Legal Philosophy)	Books	4	4	5	N	Y	Useful	This is the updated and reissued 1985 edition of Stein's seminal 1957 book, \\"Vassouras\\", an academic study of a 19th century coffee plantation in Brazil.  It is interesting for the Brazil scholar, accessible, and thoroughly-researched.  This edition has photos that give readers a bit more sense of time and place than the original book.<br />Vassouras is a town in the interior of Rio de Janeiro state.  From about 1820 to 1900, it arced from backwater to a cradle of fabulous nouveau wealth based on monoculture coffee production, and back again.  Its rise and fall were based on two elements:  access to virgin forest land which could be cleared to plant coffee bushes and access to slave labor to work the enormous plantations.  Both land and laborer were brutally abused, and by 1888, when Brazil became the last country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery, Vassouras's farmland was nearly sterile for lack proper farming techniques.  In the years to come, neighboring Sao Paulo state became the next (and still) coffee king of Brazil, as it adapted modern agriculture and wage labor.<br />Stein's classic work remains fresh today, a fascinating look at slavery-era plantations and shortsighted farm management.  Explanations of an ossified and polarized society that reproduced patterns of colonial plantations --a farm model that continues to skew Brazilian land patterns today-- are insightful.  As Vassouras planters saw their assets evaporate as their labor force and acreage plummeted in value, the foundation for an entire economy collapsed.  Their choices brought about this collapse, and Stein is able to chronicle them in detail.<br />The work is strong, but suffers from a grating failure common to academic works that are converted into mass publications:  maps.  The book has no good maps.  The sole map is a near-useless rendering of the hills around Vassouras.  But the book deals at length with roads and railways and the annual odyssey of transporting crops to Rio, with immigration from Minas and Sao Paulo states.  A dozen clear maps would have made this book much better.ith immigration from Minas and Sao Paulo states.  A dozen clear maps would have made this book much better.	2003-08-23

Brazil's rural poor began organizing in the late 1970s, during the military regime, occupying unused farmlands and agitating for ownership of family-size plots.  MST was founded in 1984 and has grown larger and stronger in the years since.  Branford and Rocha have no pretense of academic objectivity:  they are perfectly up-front about their leftist ideology and sympathy for their subject.  This is occasionally annoying, because all of the assessments are skewed in one direction, but it is manageable for the critical reader.  This perspective becomes particularly unsuitable in the final chapters, which give an overview and a look forward.  But the accounts of MST are interesting.  Interviews with peasants and leaders, discussions of well-known land invasions and demonstrations in Para and Sao Paulo states.  These make the book worthwhile.  At least they have done their research, talked to the principals, and got their dates and facts mostly in order.<br />This is far stronger than Branford's previous work, &quot;Carnival of the Oppressed&quot;, a stilted under-researched account of Brazil's Workers' Party, and it is certainly more comprehensive than Rocha's &quot;In Focus Brazil&quot;, a strange little cultural travel-guide.  &quot;Cutting the Wire&quot; is far from perfect, not at all even-handed, but is nevertheless a useful contribution to understanding modern Brazilian history.	2003-08-01

The Grateful Dead, the Clash, John Hurt, and dozens of others told a story about the night Stagolee shot Billy in a bar fight. The words may have varied, and the story may have seemed archetypical, but there was something going on here. Cecil Brown has traced the story to its origins: a bar in St. Louis's red light district in 1895, when Lee Shelton gunned down Billy Lyons because Lyons had touched his hat. Brown has done the research and provides interesting insights into urban culture and race relations in a time and place not far removed from slavery. He reviews different variations of the song, looks into the lives of the real-life protagonists, and discusses why the story made such a good source for songs for the next hundred years.	2003-07-31

A little scrubby horse with a crooked leg and a funny gait who teamed up with a taciturn trainer and a half-blind jockey to win dozens of races and the hearts of millions of fans.  It's not surprising that the book has been made into a movie, it's perfect grist for the big screen.  The book is as good as the story.  Hillebrand, whose personal challenges have been widely reported, has done the research.  In fact, the Acknowledgments and Notes sections are as fun to read as the body of the book.  Hillebrand tracked down sources, both written and oral and put a nearly-lost story back together.  In the process, she clearly fell in love with the horse and his little team.  I imagine she lost some objectivity along the way, but her passion for the subject shines through.  It's a good story, a sweet story, a real-life tear-jerker.	2003-07-01

How do teams select players, which players will be most effective over their careers, and what player traits lead to victories?  These are the questions that Billy Beane has considered and reconsidered since he took over the helm of the low-budget Oakland team and found himself competing against teams like the New York Yankees, who could spend three times as much on player salaries.<br />Through heresies like reading the number-crunching of Bill James drafting fat ballplayers, and worrying more about On Base Average than fielding skills, Beane both outrages the baseball establishment and builds successful teams that make the playoffs and stay on budget.<br />This is a good book.  You may not agree with Beane's strategy -in fact, that's precisely the point- but the book is well-researched and well-written.  Lewis has done his homework.  I only wish he'd talked to more people who disagree with Beane's approach.  Over and over we read that Beane is an innovative genius with a Midas touch, but we never read any of the arguments against his strategy.  A bit more balance would have been nice.

Books	4	3	4	N	Y	Interesting, but a Grating Style	\\"Stupid White Men\\" is a liberal screed, skewering the Bush family, Republicans, whites, and the wealthy and blaming them for many of the modern world's ills. Ok, that seems pretty fun, and it is... for a while. Moore has done enough research from secondary sources and media websites that he's not making stuff up, but he's more of a savvy hobbyist than an expert in the fields he covers. And he covers a lot of ground: the eleven chapters are divided thematically into discussions about things like the Bush family, lames whites, lame men, American parochialism, etc. He even helpfully documents his research in the \\"Notes and Sources\\" section, but it all comes from mainstream newspaper articles. That doesn't make it untrue, just underresearched, more of a college term paper than a serious look at the American system. When he offers advice, a la Thomas Friedman, on how to resolve the problems in the middle east or the former Yugoslavia, he's way out of his league.<br />The book is fun, it's cute, and it may give voice to some of the same outrage that you've felt from time to time. Moore unapologetically only provides one side of the story, coming off as more of a wiseacre who spends a lot of time trying to crack the code of modern political rhetoric. And that's ultimately the part of the book that gets tiring. The tone of voice just grates, until this reader was skimming through the paragraphs of breathless outrage in order to get to the substance of the arguments. Moore's writing style hovers somewhere between the apoplectic college sophomore writing for the school paper and the sarcastic talking heads who blow steam on Sunday morning political shows.<br />It's an interesting book, a fun weekend read, and some of the anecdotes are eye-opening. But it's not terribly serious or groundbreaking. A book to pass around to your friends without worrying about whether they ever return it to you.	2003-06-05

A New York kid whose taste for adventure was sparked in his boyhood by a dead seal for sale on a Broadway sidewalk. Harvard student, soldier, Rough Rider, youngest President ever and one who survived the assassin's bullet, maverick politician, Nobel Prize winner, hunter and conservationist, and finally the man who, at 55 years old, explored an unknown region of the Amazon river basin. Imagine one of today's former-Presidents undertaking a similar adventure. For six weeks, in 1914, Roosevelt and his party paddled and carried their canoes down a previously unexplored 950-mile river now called the Rio Roosevelt. Men died, boats were lost, food became scarce, dangerous animals and natives were about, fever borne by insects sickened many in the party (and led to Roosevelt's own death five years later). This is the stuff of \\"Through the Brazilian Wilderness\\".<br />Roosevelt's other works, including \\"The Rough Riders\\", are better known, and this one is not great literature. Instead, it is a remarkable adventure story by an interesting man. The book is essentially Roosevelt's trip diary, colored by his great enthusiasm for adventure and the natural world. Even before reaching the Amazon, Roosevelt stops at a Brazilian snake research lab that so captures his attention that he writes seventeen pages about it. At all times, he makes careful note of the wildlife he encounters, not quite with the depth of a professional scientist, but with the trained eye of a dedicated and experienced hobbyist. He squeezes in some amusing stories about piranha fish that he heard --and apparently believed. Naturalists of the day killed animals in the name of science, which places in context Roosevelt's joy in hunting and his comments: first on alligators (\\"They are often dangerous and are always destructive to fish, and it is good to shoot them\\") and later on conservation (\\"There is every reason why the good people of South America should waken... to the duty of preserving from extinction the wildlife which is an asset of such interest.\\"). The book is most poetic in its description of animal life, and particularly in registering surprise that the myriad insects are far more pernicious than any of the better-known dangers such as alligators, big cats, or piranhas.<br />The book's is not perfect, and Roosevelt is not a great author in a literary sense, rather making up in enthusiasm what he lacks in prose and penetrating insight. There is no attempt at political analysis, he simply praises Brazilians as good hosts who have started down the road to democracy. He sees the land he travels through as like the United States of perhaps a hundred years earlier, so there are frequent predictions that a promising location is ripe for development. The limited foray into politics is to praise Positivism, the ideology of the Brazilian military class that emphasized modernity and structure, and that not incidentally justified the many instances of military intervention in Brazilian politics over the years. Finally, the one annoyance is the recurring theme (perhaps a dozen times in all) of the true danger of the journey. Over and over we read that the river has never been charted, that it is truly dangerous, that the explorers are not your armchair-adventurer variety, and that such voyages will necessarily be easier for those who follow in the future.

The captain of a naval ship goes overboard in a storm, and it is the job of protagonist, blind magistrate Sir John Fielding to discover whether it is murder or misadventure.  After the cardboard plotting of his first book, and the overly-convenient plot twists of the second, \\"Watery Grave\\" shows that the author is capable of more complicated plotting and characterization.  The conflict between naval and civil justice is developed, and the underlying theme of homosexuality provides a dark motive.<br />While it is true that, as some critics point out, Patrick O'Brien's British nautical series, set a few decades after this series, is far superior in characterization, dialogue, and historical research, perhaps that sets the standard too high.  This series is not brilliant or deeply-researched, it is simply a string of fun, readable whodunits.  The interest is provided by the Fielding and his young assistant, Jeremy Proctor, and by the historical color of 18th century London.  The greatest flaw in these books, I believe, is not the thin historical research, but the weakness of the courtroom scenes.  After spending chapters exposing lies and hunting down witnesses, readers should rightfully expect better and more dramatic trial scenes.  It's far from perfect, but it's pretty enjoyable all the same.	2003-03-29

But it suffers from serious deficiencies.<br />First, it provides no deep analysis, even of seminal events in the life of Lula and the development of the PT party.  Key events are just mentioned in passing, sort of a chronological narrative, but never placed into context.  For example, the death of Lula's first wife in childbirth in 1970, considered crucial to his views on public health care is noted in one sentence.  His current wife is named, but her key role in Lula's life is never described.  Similarly, there is not a single mention of Jose Dirceu, a Sao Paulo revolutionary turned politician who emerged as the PT's savviest politician and is now Lula's most trusted advisor.  There is no discussion about the internal debates in the labor movement that led up to the founding of the PT in 1980.  The assessment of President Fernando Collor's political problems is head-shakingly weak: \\"Collor it seemed, had alienated the traditional centers of power and patronage.\\"<br />The second deficiency is the book's overt leftist agenda.  That's fine, we might suppose, nothing wrong with an author having an axe to grind.  The problem is that the leftist propaganda here gets in the way of accuracy.  Over and over we learn about the perfidious Brazilian right (sometimes emphasized by spelling it \\"Right\\") and its links to the press and other forces aligned against the PT good guys.  This is especially grating when it comes to the 1994 elections.  We read several strange diatribes blaming neoliberalism (and even \\"USA fashions\\") for Fernando Henrique Cardoso's come from behind victory over Lula.  The author seems to believe that Lula deserved to be elected, but that the sneaky Cardoso used a tricky political strategy to win.  Similarly, the Brazilian press (\\"Few ordinary Brazilian knew what the word 'scruples' meant, and the mass media were not about to enlighten them.\\") and conservative evangelicals (\\"[evangelicals] set up self-help networks just as the Muslim fundamentalists do.\\") come in for a beating because they do not support the PT.<br />There are a few inaccuracies and oversights that further weaken the text:  the map fails to show the state of Tocantins, although it was founded seven years before the book was published; on p.48 we read that the PT was \\"officially founded in August 1980\\", when in fact it was founded six months earlier.  There is but one photo of Lula, and none of any other PT leaders, even in the six little sections giving profiles of notable PT members.

It is a period mystery set in 18th-century London.  Blind magistrate Sir John Fielding and his young sidekick Jeremy, who narrates the story, solves a mass murder case in London's publishing district.  It's a good tale, but some of the weaknesses of the first book are still here:  Fielding does things no blind person -no matter how gifted- can do; young Jeremy speaks like an educated adult, and his occasional forays into childhood speech sound just like an adult-trying-to-write-like-a-child wrote them.  The plot is carefully constructed but hinges on some artificial twists that must leave readers shaking their heads:  Jeremy narrowly escapes from a building that blows down in the wind, not once but twice; a poor street urchin pops up conveniently every few pages to provide important clues.  The most interesting thing about Alexander's mystery series is the local color and language of historical London.  They're fun and easy to read, but as mystery novels go, these first two are strictly average.	2003-03-17

It comes across as style over substance.  Torres' is among the generation of Brazilian authors whose voice was forged during the 1964-1985 military regime.  Self-censorship, obliqueness, wry observation, and double-meanings were their stock in trade. The most interesting element in \\"Blues for a Lost Childhood\\" is the strange construction:  a nameless self-pitying narrator in a drunken stupor recalling the decline and death of his best friend.  Part Hunter S. Thompson and part Dostoevsky.  Poems, memories, newspaper articles, dreams, and hallucinations are braided together, the timeline jumping abruptly from sentence to sentence, challenging the reader and setting up a mosaic of... of what?  The problem is that, at bottom, there's not much to look at.  A pathetic drunken sot wallowing in self-pity and guilt, remembering his childhood, his family (\\"My father won't help me ever again.\\"), and his dead friend.  It's just not very interesting material to build a story around<br />There are lots of wonderful quotes (\\"Until I was twenty I believed in Holy Mother Church.  Between twenty and thirty, I believed in the Communist Party.  From thirty to forty, I believed in Psychoanalysis.  Now all I believe in is a full line on a bingo card.\\"), pieces of songs, and half-remembered references to other works.  There are interesting observations about Brazil and Brazilians and a fascinating introduction to modern Brazilian literature by translator John Parker.  It's all interesting enough, lots of modernistic flash, but ultimately not a great novel.	2003-03-09

While it provides readers with some useful background, it fails at critical balance.  It is further undermined by serious factual errors and an overall lack of depth.<br />Fernando Henrique Cardoso grew up in Sao Paulo, Brazil where he studied sociology and Marxism.  He went into exile after Brazil's 1964 military coup, living in Chile and France, before returning to Brazil to found a leftist think tank.  Cardoso's 1969 book, \\"Dependency and Development in Latin America\\", was a seminal work that established his reputation as a world-class sociologist.  Joining the opposition party in the 1970s, Cardoso eventually became a Senator and a key drafter of the 1988 constitution.  He captured the Brazilian imagination in 1994 as Finance Minister when his \\"Real Plan\\" tamed hyperinflation.  Launched by this success, he was elected President that same year.<br />As the book's analysis demonstrates, Cardoso's greatest asset was his flexibility.  For, unlike many of his contemporary intellectuals, Cardoso was not a doctrinaire Marxist who insisted on squeezing modern realities into the mold of his pre-conceived ideology.  Instead, he used Marxism and his own dependency theory as working models to identify solutions to real problems.  He was, in this sense, a pragmatic and effective applied social scientist.  For those readers familiar with Cardoso as president, this book provides useful background demonstrating how he --like the president who followed him, Lula da Silva-- moved from the far left toward the center over his career.  This evolution allowed Cardoso, and Lula, to gain the confidence of the financial classes and win national elections.<br />The book is strongest, not surprisingly, in explaining sociological principles.  Author Goertzel is a sociology professor at home describing academic environments and Marxist minutiae.  But it is weakest on the economic and political analyses that are critical to understanding Cardoso's terms as president.  There are many factual errors whose cumulative effect undermines the credibility of the entire book.  Thus the Planalto Palace is incorrectly described as a \\"two-story office building\\" (it has four stories); Cardoso ally Antonio Carlos Magalhaes is termed a \\"distinguished senator\\" (he is a thoroughly corrupt machine politician).  We learn (p.164) that a two-thirds congressional majority is required to amend the constitution (a three-fifths majority is required); and that the 1997 global economic crisis began in Hong Kong (it began in Thailand).  The book refers (p.193)  to Brazil's congressional districts (Brazil has no congressional districts, all candidates run statewide); and confuses the Bank of Brazil with the government Central Bank.<br />Even more serious is the inability to balance affection for Cardoso with insightful criticism.  From a pointless description of Cardoso's first college term paper to its overuse of the word \\"brilliant\\" to describe the subject, the book never rises beyond the level of highbrow fanzine.  Though he spent some time in Brazil in the 1960s, the author is no Brazilianist and his analysis of events often slips into facile generalizations (\\"Many Brazilians of humble means do not want their president to be a common person like themselves.\\").  The worst analysis occurs where complicated events call for critical review, there is just no attempt to criticize Cardoso.  Thus readers get apologizes, rather than serious analysis, of Cardoso's failure to implement land reform and intellectual flip-flops that pre-load conclusions most flattering to Cardoso.  For example on p.162, readers learn that the constitution limits the powers of the presidency, yet two paragraphs later we read that the president has \\"formidable powers\\".  There is a similar about-face on the views of economist Rudiger Dornbusch.  Overall, the economic analysis is particularly shallow (the author refers on p.164 to alleged \\"international guidelines\\" on a country's deficit spending).<br />The concluding paragraph is so weak that readers who have made it to the end can only shake their heads.  For after describing how Brazil in the 1990s failed to implement fundamental reforms, the last page tells us \\"Congress was rapidly passing much needed reforms\\", and lamely concludes \\"If the new commitment to reform can be sustained, the country's long-term prospects are good.\\"  The book is not a total failure, but it has serious weaknesses and a grating pro-Cardoso bias that suggests it is the Cardoso fans' attempt to get in the first word on his historical legacy.

The book is certainly darker and grittier, but most importantly, if makes sense.  Where the TV show invents a nonsensical character who is part physical therapist and part sidekick, as well as a weird three-way relationship among Smith, his former fiancee, and her new husband; the book is far better written and has none of this.  People make sense in this novel.<br />Johnny Smith is a New England schoolteacher, the reluctant recipient of strange visionary powers after he emerges from a car-crash induced coma.  He gains a momentary celebrity when he uses these visions to solve crimes and avert disasters.  But Smith himself is unhappy, floundering in the question of why he was given such a strange gift/curse.  His angst is resolved when he begins to realize that he bears the responsibility to stop a young, charismatic politician who, he sees, will evolve in the coming years into a major force of evil - a new Hitler.  Smith faces a set of personal and moral decisions as he grapples with how to deal with this nemesis.  \\"The Dead Zone\\" delivers on the promise of all of Stephen King's novels:  an entertaining supernatural page turner that can be read in a weekend without unduly challenging a reader.

Vargas Llosa's book is as long (over 500 pages) and as dense as the seminal Canudos book \\"Rebellion in the Backlands\\" by Euclides da Cunha, and those fascinated by the story will want to read both.  This book takes da Cunha's as its point of departure, for where da Cunha was a military engineer who accompanied the military campaigns against Canudos and wrote about the event's impact on the Brazilian identity, Vargas Llosa is a novelist captivated by the human element.  \\"The War of the End of the World\\" is the massive story of four successive military campaigns against a religious sect (part-Waco, part-Masada) that killed about 10,000 people on both sides.  It is built on the lives of many key personalities.  By threading together the life stories of several real Canudos inhabitants who included criminals, castoffs, and misfits with the lives of landowners, journalists, and military officers, including the famously brutal general Moreira Cesar, Vargas Llosa both chronicles the Canudos tale and creates a powerful human novel.<br />Da Cunha was intrigued by the \\"why\\" of Canudos.  What fostered a fanatical religious sect in Brazil's interior, allowed it thrive and grow, and why was it the subject of such national fear that the fourth campaign against the village involved fully half of the Brazilian army?  Da Cunha spent dozens of pages writing about Antonio the Counselor, Canudos messianic leader.  Vargas Llosa is less sympathetic to the military's point of view, depicting Canudos as a safe haven for those rejected by society, by sweethearts, employers, or the church.  An island of broken toys.  Vargas Llosa writes very little about Antonio himself, casting a reflected light by describing him mostly through the words and actions of his devoted followers. (\\"Death was more important to these people than life.  They had lived in utter dereliction and their one ambition was to be given a decent burial\\".)  Where da Cunha concludes that Canudos was a result of a failure by the Brazilian society and government to embrace all of its citizens -a conclusion that led to a reexamination of Brazil's national identity- Vargas Llosa is less sure.  He raises a lot of explanations that have gone before (monarchist conspiracies, racial inferiority, lack of education, \\"something to do with religion\\", even a lunatic European communist who tries to make Canudos fit his notions of class warfare ) without settling firmly on any one.  Finally, he concludes uneasily, \\"the explanation of Canudos lies in ignorance\\".<br />This is a gripping novel, a powerful tale of warfare, an exploration of intriguing individuals who met in the atavistic isolation of Brazil's parched interior.

This is a challenging book, over 500 pages in this edition, dense and probably unsuitable to those who need the stimulation of a pop novel.  Da Cunha was present at the 1896-97 military assaults on the rebellious village of Canudos in the arid Brazilian interior.  A gifted writer with a background as a military engineer, Da Cunha brings a precise experts eye to the military campaigns, never failing at such details as order of battle, casualties, supply lines, and tactics.  The campaigns themselves were stirring and bloody affairs:  four separate military campaigns, each larger than the last that met increasingly stiff resistance from the Canudos villagers.  In the end, 10,000 souls may have perished on both sides.  The end, of course, is well known to all Brazilians.  Canudos did not surrender.  The only case of its kind in history, it held out to the last man.  Conquered inch by inch, in the literal meaning of the words, it fell on October 5, toward dusk  when the last defenders fell, dying every man of them.  There were only four of them left: an old man, two other grown men, and a child, facing a furiously raging army of five thousand soldiers.<br />If the book were merely a military history, it would be successful.  But it is far more, for Da Cunha is more than just a military observer.  He is geologist, geographer, anthropologist, sociologist, and historian.  This book literally defines the still-nascent nation of Brazil.  The backwoods villagers of Canudos were inspired by a religious fervor cultivated by a heretical evangelist named Antonio the Counselor.  Their story is part Masada and part Waco.  Da Cunha places Antonio in the context of his own life and the development of Brazils interior.  While sometimes indulging in unfortunate racial generalities, Da Cunha takes an incredible interest in the geography of the region, describing how it shapes people.  How the society that emerges in such a poor and desiccated land can yield the lawlessness and anomie suitable for the development of an Antonio.  Da Cunha both despises and respects the villagers, jaguncos, in Canudos.  He hates their illiteracy, superstition and backwardness while grudgingly praising their bravery, loyalty, and cunning.<br />Canudos, in his view, is a time warp, Brazilian society spun back to a primitive time, and for that all Brazilians share guilt.  He blames urbanites and elites, the generals and craven politicians, the recently deposed monarchy and the addiction to European styles for the evolution of a Canudos.  Two Brazils have developed, he writes, one is built on the European and Portuguese model and necessarily fails to address the second Brazil, the one populated by millions of rural souls in the impoverished interior, for Portugal was never faced with such a community.<br />Da Cunhas genius is demonstrating that Canudos is a consequence of the failure to develop a unified national identity that incorporates all Brazilians.  It is a battle between old poor Brazil and progressive modern Brazil.  Thus his book was the first step to defining the true Brazilian nationality, one that survives to today  a nationality that blends European, African, and native traditions.  A nationality to which all Brazilians now belong.  Canudos was a wrenching experience in many ways.  There was immediate and widespread shock over the year of military disasters and thousands of casualties inflicted by a ragtag band of backlanders.  Then there was the deeper self-analysis that accompanied the publication of this book.  Like other American states, Brazil could never survive until it stopped looking to the Old World and developed its own identity, one shaped by its own people and circumstances, and one that acknowledged the existence and worth of every citizen.<br />The enduring testament to Da Cunha is that he was among the first to recognize the need for such a national self-criticism, and his work is one of the efforts that launched it.  Brazil is what it is today in part because of the clarity of Da Cunhas vision of Brazil as set out in this monumental work.

He doesn't have to.  The bulk of \\"Longitudes & Attitudes\\" is a collection of his regular New York Times columns from December 2000 until July 2002.  Friedman regulars will have read most or all of these columns, and even his occasional readers will be familiar with the handful of pieces that have gained fame for the clarity of their vision and their new insights into old problems.  Friedman's message is simple.  Anti-democratic Arab regimes conspire with radical Muslim clerics throughout the Middle East in an unholy alliance to maintain the illegitimate governments in power with the support of religious leaders spewing medieval backwardness and hatred.  The U.S. props up many of these regimes in the name of an expedient short-term stability aimed at milking them of their oil reserves.  Who suffers?  Everyone.  Arab societies are trapped in a backward-looking anti-modernist world of illiteracy, intolerance, repression of women, and censorship.  A foreseeable by-product are hate-filled xenophobic young men who would rather kill themselves and thousands of innocents than search for creative solutions to this seemingly intractable impasse.  Against this backdrop always looms the Israeli/Palestinian conflict which fuels the flames of anti-Western rhetoric while simultaneously distracting Arab societies from the pressing need to reform themselves.  And this conflict can not be resolved until Israelis withdraw from their settlements in Palestinian areas and until Yasir Arafat is no longer a player.<br />Friedman sounds this drumbeat over and over, with anecdotes, insights, analysis, and ruminations.  His language is as simple as his message and has won him three Pulitzer Prizes.  He is an unabashed American patriot with excellent contacts throughout the region.  He is not an academic, but someone who has a heart, passion, skill, and is gifted with the ability to make sense of chaos and to find threads of music in cacophony.

Alencar was nothing if not prolific, he wrote dozens of novels, plays, and poetry, and worked as a journalist and politician.  &quot;Senhora&quot; is interesting because it came out during a period when so little serious fiction featured strong women as protagonists.  Aurelia, the title character, is a beautiful young woman who comes into a huge inheritance in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro and overturns social conventions by buying the husband of her choice.  So the story's real depth and primary point of discussion revolves around Brazil's upper class norms, women's social roles, and the power of wealth.  It is interesting in this regard.  Alencar's Romanticism is rooted in a sort of pre-revolutionary distaste (if not disgust) for established social conventions.  He was a wealthy intellectual criticizing his own milieu.<br />Perhaps his descriptions of wealth --pages dedicated to the delicate inlays in a single piece of furniture or the passion of a waltz-- are overwrought, and may strike some readers as being born of Alencar's lust for upper class pursuits, rather than of any detached criticism of them.  Readers must be prepared for these careful descriptions of wealthy follies, for by modern standards very little happens in the story.  Alencar was a Romanticist, meaning that he cultivated in his writing elements of anti-classicism, of free-form emotion, and of descriptions of settings rather than tracing the chronology of a plot.  This is a story driven on one level by its complicated prose and on another by its social criticism and the depth of its characters.  Modern readers looking for plot and action may not have the patience for this book, and may also find the ending (called a &quot;surprising twist&quot; by some critics) to be a bit of a cop-out.  It's as though Alencar didn't want to write any longer or didn't want to disappoint what he imagined to be a primarily female audience thirsting for romantic closure.any longer or didn't want to disappoint what he imagined to be a primarily female audience thirsting for romantic closure.	2002-10-24

Wilder richly deserved the Pulitzer that this book earned.  Short, at 133 pages in this edition, it is uniformly excellent.  Wilder's sharp wit and turn of phrase are unmatched.  The book's theme is powerful and resolved in an unexpected and profound way.  Brother Juniper, a thoughtful friar, witnesses the collapse of a rope bridge over a gorge in rural Peru in 1714 and the death of the five people walking along it.  He views this event as an opportunity to prove the existence of god and, finally, to elevate theology to the rank of the hard sciences.  Juniper instinctively believes that there must be a divine reason for those five to have been chosen for death.  He senses god's powerful, latent hand in the bridge's collapse and commits himself to learning all there is to know about the victims in order to discern the plan and prove god's existence.  Who were the victims?  What were their lives like?  Why did they die?<br />Juniper's conclusions are, of course, inconclusive.  He never found the pattern, but remained convinced that it was there, just that he was too poor an intellect to see it.  Such questions, naturally, were anathema to the church of the age and Juniper and his book were destroyed for heresy.  Readers who focus on the same questions as Juniper are doomed to be just as frustrated.  Wilder is far too insightful to let Juniper have the last word, for ultimately, it is not Juniper who stumbles upon the meaning of the five deaths, but the survivors -those who loved the victims- as well as the reader.  What the five had in common was that they were human beings, with tender sides and flaws and significant unrequited loves.  There is nothing remarkable here, we are all built that way.  After their deaths, the Abbess whose orphanage was home to two of the victims realizes that the meaning lies in the lives themselves, in the love the victims shared with those near to them.  That there is no immortality, not even memory or good works, so that what matters is the fleeting existence of goodness, and therein lies god's grace.  Love is a powerful and immediate force, not a point for theological debate.  \\"Many who have spent a lifetime in passion can tell us less of love than the child that lost a dog yesterday.\\"<br />Wilder's prose is smooth and polished and yielding of aphorisms:  the six attributes of the adventurer (a memory for names and faces, the gift of tongues, inexhaustible invention, secrecy, a talent for chatting with strangers, and a freedom from conscience); or an observation that \\"the public for which masterpieces are intended is not on this earth.\\"  Every line is adept, every page a wonder.<br />While Wilder wrote the book in 1927, it  is perhaps a perfect inquiry into 17th century baroque worldviews and the rationalist philosophies they spawned.  The baroque had reached Spain, if not Peru, by 1714.  Its fascination with death and the brevity of life (\\"carpe diem\\" and countless reminders of the inevitabiity of death) resound her, as do its emphasis on vanity, and theater as a metaphor for life.  Lima's theatre, its actresses and audiences, are central to the book.  And it is only when the beautiful actress is struck by tragedies that she reaches her resolution in grace.  Juniper himself embodies that strange blend of baroque scientific materialism and divine idealism of an age in which Descartes could prove the existence of god while Newton demonstrated god's machinery in motion.<br />Wilder's solution is much more satisfying than Descartes' or Juniper's.  Wilder may have been baroque in his cynicism, but he was decidedly 20th century american in his hopefulness.  \\"The Bridge of San Luis Rey\\" is a stunning book.that what matters is the fleeting existence of goodness, and therein lies god's grace.

He's been through Britain's wars in India and he leaves his wife in Pennsylvania to enlist in the Union army just in time for First Bull Run.  He is a wonderfully eccentric character, limping from a war wound, a complaining stoic, morally rigid yet warm-hearted, courageous and obstinate.  And he speaks, even to himself, in a pleasant Welsh burr.  It's fun to follow him as he unravels the murder of a young abolitionist Union officer.<br />Owen Parry kicks off his Civil War mystery series with \\"Faded Coat of Blue\\".  He writes in the postscript of his passion for the period, his research and his trips to the places that he writes about.  He's done a good job getting the period right, with lots of wry observations (the Fowler's Philadelphia mansion is \\"Haversham House\\" after the batty recluse in Dickens' 'Great Expectations'), he just comments on the building on the Virginia ridge overlooking Washington's Mall, without adding that it was Robert E. Lee's home and now the center of Arlington Cemetery.  Of course, in a strained final scene, President Lincoln himself makes an appearance.  Parry didn't want to waste either his sympathy for or his knowledge of Lincoln.  But the research is right, the details, the streets of Washington, and the history provide a wonderful context for a murder mystery.<br />With one small exception:  the book's final scenes culminate in the 1861 Thanksgiving holiday.  Alas, Lincoln didn't declare Thanksgiving a holiday until 1863.	2002-09-28
US	51930306	R1P122P7TYD2DX	0449911632	194654736	Brazil: A Novel	Books	3	5	9	N	Y	Occasionally Interesting but Predictable	Everyone knows and loves Updike.  His own worst enemy is himself.  In choosing to set his \\"Tristan and Isolde\\" love story in Brazil, the author has overextended himself.  He simply doesn't know enough about Brazil, doesn't have that visceral sense of the country that would make this book a success.  As a result, the characters often explain things at length in their dialogue that any Brazilian already knows.  Thus, while the author strives for a sort of magical realist effect in fantastical dialogue and plotting, the words that come out of the characters' mouths are things that no Brazilian would ever say.  Case in point: the poor favela-dwellers speak some bizarre inner-city U.S. ghetto lingo that just makes no sense in a Brazilian context.<br />The plot is straightforward and linear, black/white, racial tension.  Nothing new there.  The denouement is utterly predictable.  When his own attention lags, the author tosses in a gratuitous sex scene.  The sex, ostensibly designed to demonstrate the fiery heat of the lovers' passion, is a strange blend of tawdry and clinically kinky... it carries no heat.  And frankly, by the twentieth sex scene, a reader can be forgiven for skipping ahead a few paragraphs to pick up the story again.<br />Despite the occasional pithy gem, (\\"Women and men occupy two different realms, and their mating is like the moment when a bird seizes a fish\\"), the regular attempts to stir in some profundity generally dissolve into mere banality.  This is not a deep book, it was not carefully thought-through.  It is just a linear tale.  Even Updike is getting a little bored by the end, as he completes one of the final chapters:  \\"Though this chapter covers the greatest stretch of time, let it be no longer than it is!\\"  Bleary-eyed readers will agree with this sentiment.	2002-09-16

Twins Yaqub and Omar are each other's mortal enemies and mirror opposites.  The story reeks of jungle noises, river smells, and the crowded, complicated family lives of a working class family with secrets and betrayals.  Hatoum's structure -the narrator's identity is revealed only slowly, and the narrator himself evolves just as the family and the city itself- is successful.  The prose never rises off the page, perhaps a function of the translation or Hatoum's own deliberate style, but the story is a good one.  A family and a story whose birth and development bear the seeds of their own tragedy and fall.	2002-09-08

The book is weakly constructed as a philosophy course taught to 14-year old Sophie by a mysterious stranger.  But it is this &quot;novel&quot; side of the book that is the thinnest, for Sophie and the other characters in the novel are mere cardboard cutouts tacked on to the margins of the chapters to provide context for the the real book:  the philosophy course.<br />The course chronologically covers thirty major periods, schools of thought, and philosophers from the pre-Socratics through Aristotle, Aquinas, and Hegel to the Big Bang.  Each is presented in an accessible chapter of a dozen pages, with the philosophy teacher simplifying and clarifying points for Sophie.  With the philosophers presented in chronological order, readers can track the trends of thought as each builds on those who came before.  &quot;Sophie's World&quot; is not a great novel, but it is an excellent review of philosophy, and a quick 500 pages.	2002-09-02

While it's often fun to tune in to their wonder and amazement at the  things they discover, there are occasional disappointments.  The stories range in quality from the very strong (Alma Guillermoprieto discussing evangelism, Bill McKibben on the orderly city of Curitiba, Alexander Shankland on Canudos); to the so-so (Downs Matthews on the nineteenth century flight of American confederate sympathizers to Brazil - a good topic but written in a silly sappy prose); to the downright unreadable (Christopher Hall on Candomble, Rachel C. Derrick searching for Africa in Salvador, John Krich on Ipanema, and Gilbert Phelps' pointless and themeless final chapter).<br />Predictably, most of the stories discuss Rio, the Amazon, and Salvador.  Useful and colorful, no doubt, but the gems are those that get off these well-chronicled paths and surprise a reader with something really new.  Like most travel-style writers, many here offer their own novice attempts at Portuguese words, often amusingly wrong, but earnest.  Brazil is a vast, shocking, wonderful country.  This book is fairly successful at presenting different facets and different perspectives.  Perhaps it's not the only book you'd want to read if you were going to spend some time in Brazil, but it's among the handful that would help you understand the people and the place.	2002-08-23

They have purposely simplified the concepts and eliminated elements that might provide richer historical detail but would also serve to confuse a reader without a legal background.  &quot;In Our Defense&quot; succeeds as an introduction to the Bill of Rights.  It does not go into great detail about the framers' intent, although there is some background in several of the cases.  It does not explain how appelate courts or the Supreme Court operate, how precedents accumulate, or define legal concepts (concurring, dissenting, etc.).  It does, however, detail each of the ten amendments, and provide a case study for each, demonstrating how the rights are interpreted, how they are limited, and how the law evolves over time.<br />A good book, particularly with issues such as abortion, handgun control, and flag burning on the front pages of the newspapers.

This is the most comprehensive recent history of Brazil by a Brazilian to be translated into English.  Its having been written by a Brazilian academic makes it a useful read for those who are also reading books by Americans (Skidmore, Eakin, etc.)  But this book founders on Fausto's deep historical understanding and thorough research.  There was no factoid too minute or political movement too mundane to leave out.  Result:  only the most tenacious reader will be able to plod through this leaden work.<br />Arthur Brakel's translation is mediocre, particularly in the early pages.  The prose gets clunky and uses a lot of academic words oddly out of place (\\"insure\\" vice \\"ensure\\", a situation always \\"obtains\\" rather than exists).  The maps are a major failure, as the first one is on page 86 and is outdated and inaccurate (failing to show either the country's capital, Brasilia, or states such as Toncatins) yet showing useless details of railway spurs.  The next edition needs a dozen strong historical maps, showing the progression from colonial captaincies to modern state.  Maps on the conflicts with Uruguay and Paraguay are particularly lacking.<br />The overabundance of detail about obscure 18th and 19th century political movements merely bogs down the reader.  For despite the author's disclaimer in the Preface, this work is really is a chronological narrative only thinly based on underlying themes (such as slavery and regionalism).  While Fausto claims to reject \\"inertia theory\\" of Brazilian history, the book is really a testament to those ideas.  The book is not a complete failure, there are strong and detailed discussions of the coffee economy, a good (though mapless) description of the war with Paraguay, and a particularly insightful discussion of Brazil's long-term, complicated relationship with Great Britain.<br />The author deliberately made the arbitrary and unhelpful decision to eschew discussion of cultural themes because, he claims, they deserve their own book.  Thus readers are deprived of essential material on art, sexuality, family, and sport that are integral to understanding Brazil.  These themes are more usefully described in Eakin's book.  Sao Paulo's \\"Modern Art Week\\", one of the crucial events in Brazil's modern history, is not mentioned even once.  The author is excessively Sao Paulo-centric.  Most of the text focuses on minor details of Sao Paulo's development to the exclusion of other regions.<br />While Fausto provides more detail, clarification, and insight than Eakin or Skidmore on many topics, such as the impact of positivism on military thinking, the book gets bogged down in dry recitiation of economic statistics without real analysis and in discussion of minor historical events without real import.  It is finally defeated by its dry, uninspired prose, by a parade of chronological details and economic data that make great watershed events and minor political hiccups seem equally (un)important..

Ondaatje only writes two novels per decade, so it is both interesting and relatively easy to track his progress as an author.  \\"Coming Through Slaughter\\" draws heavily on Ondaatje's poetic roots, as rhythmic sections of smooth unself-conscious dialogue alternate with straight narrative and passages of syncopated poetry.  It is far shorter and contains more poetry than his later works -and this works well in a book about jazz.  In this, it is less mature than \\"The English Patient\\", more rooted in a young man's poetic freeform and less in the disciplined construction of a novel.  Perspectives shift from Bolden to his New Orleans friends, prostitutes, and the musicians around him who literally created jazz.  Ondaatje has a unique style of piecing a novel together from disparate pieces like a jigsaw puzzle, pieces that don't always meet at the edges -at least until the whole is complete and the details slowly merge into a profound and intricate mosaic.  This style, in its early stages, is on display here.  Characters and themes emerge slowly.  Ondaatje is a challenging author.  You may be two pages into a scene and still not know quite who is talking, or about what, or when.  But finally the rush of understanding as the scene fits logically into another that comes pages later.<br />Buddy Bolden, New Orleans cornet player, early jazz genius who dropped out of sight for two years and then made a triumphant if short-lived return, before dying in an asylum.  This is the source.  The facts about Bolden remain murky, and Ondaatje has created a life around him.  It is a story as much about jazz, New Orleans, and decay as it is about the sad life of a single horn player.	2002-07-02

Eakin is a historian who understands Brazil.  The book is not perfect, but it is solid, useful, and interesting.  First, it is well-organized:  before offering thematic chapters of deeper insight, Eakin provides a quick 60-page history from the fifteenth century to 1997.  This is useful both for newcomers to become familiar with the Brazilian context and for others to review the legacies of colonization and peaceful independence, the strange tales of Kings Joao and Pedro, slavery and abolition, the tragi-comic Vargas, and the military regimes.  Brazil has a rich and fascinating history, and Eakin does well to place its recent iterations in a long-term context.<br />Next come four thematic chapters on the land, people, politics, and economics, each  divided into useful essays so a reader can quickly read about topics from soccer and carnaval to the convoluted political machinations of the 1980s.  Broad themes underlie the discussion:  the sheer magnitude of the slave trade (that dwarfed that in the U.S.) and how it shaped society, the social trends that created the most unequal distribution of wealth in the world, and the series of export products (gold, sugar, rubber, and coffee) that contributed in waves to social development.<br />On the other hand, readers will occasionally stumble over clunkers, particularly when comparisons are drawn with the U.S:  \\"Much like New York City, Rio is a city whose era has passed\\";  \\"To be considered white in the United States, one cannot have any non-white ancestors\\"; the claim that an \\"estimated\\" 90 percent of Brazilian adults play the lottery.  The economic analysis is helpful, but never profound, and there are occasional head-shakers:  \\"In both [Brazil and the U.S.] deficit spending and foreign debt have made it difficult to marshal the resources to address fundamental social ills.\\"<br />The discussion of race relations -a deeply complicated subject that Eakin navigates with some success-  is thoughtful.  \\"Brazilians discriminated, but on the basis of color, and there were many shades.  North Americans discriminated on the basis of race, and there were but two\\";  \\"How is it possible to build a movement around consciousness of being black when most non-whites do not see themselves as black and do not wish to be considered black?\\"<br />As other reviewers have noted, the book is in need of a real update.  Most of the research ends about 1995, although there are a few references to events as late as 1997.  The decade of the 1990s has been a fascinating period for Brazilians, with the FHC administration, the Real Plan, the Argentine collapse, and the effects of globalization.  A good book, in need of a some new text.  It could also benefit from a few more maps and some historical photos.e success-  is thoughtful.  \\"Brazilians discriminated, but on the basis of color, and there were many shades.

That doesn't set the bar very high but would make for a good baseball book.  \\"That's A Winner\\" doesn't deliver on even these modest expectations.  First, Buck himself doesn't come across as a very likeable guy.  Free with his back-handed criticisms, judgmental of others, once slamming the door in the face of a desperate pregnant woman, and generally keeping his head down as the inveterate corporate guy trying to keep his job.  Second, he doesn't really have much to offer.  Less than half the book is about baseball, so the reader has to wade through chapters on Buck's youth aboard a boat, in World War II, going to school, reciting names of family and friends as though reading a phone book.  There are futile discussions of Castro and the death penalty and Vietnam, issues to which Buck brings no insight and that merely serve to distract the reader looking for some sports.  Third, when the baseball finally comes, it's feeble and fleeting.  A few thoughts on drugs use in the late 1970s, praise for Whitey Herzog and Ozzie Smith, and that's about it.  For a guy who's been around some of the greatest players in the history of the game and become famous for his steady deep-voiced announcing, Buck has written a book that manages to suck the life out of the games and players.  No stories, no funny anecdotes, nothing to interest a fan.  If you're researching Buck's life and need to know about his military service, this is the book for you.  If you want to pass a weekend with a good baseball book, pick up Roger Angell instead.	2002-05-25

She was shipping cases full of silver and jewels to be traded for Asian spices at incredible profit.  She was also shipping a weak-willed skipper, a psychopathic commercial officer named Jeronimus Cornelius, and a gang of disgruntled sailors before the mast.  After long months at sea, a mutiny was already brewing when the ship ran aground on deserted islands off Australia.  The next few months became an infamous page in naval history as Cornelius embarked on a rampage of torture, murder, and rape of hundreds of shipwrecked crew and passengers.  The Batavia Affair that horrified 17th century Amsterdam has lost none of its power.<br />More than a real-life \\"Lord of the Flies\\", the saga is a thoroughly-researched piece of Dutch history.  Author Mike Dash has poked among the historical boneyards not only on remote coral islands, but among the civic and commercial records of the long-ago United Provinces of the Netherlands.  He is a careful scholar, making educated guesses, pointing out which conclusions are supported by the evidence and which are mere speculation.  His stories of heretical sects in northern Europe, the awful life aboard a merchant ship, and the operation of the East India Company are certain to be new and fascinating reading.  Dash's careful work, gripping prose, and dry wit need no further embellishment.  The truth of the Batavia is stranger than fiction.	2002-05-20

Ondaatje's genius is to reveal characters as people are revealed in life - not in linear chronological narratives, but in glimpes, flashes of lightning, disconnected anecdotes.  Sometimes contradictory, always fascinating. The book takes the shape of these disparate images and recollections slowly coalescing to form four protagonists:  Hana the Canadian nurse, Almasy the English Patient, Caravaggio the thief, and Kip the Sikh deminer.  They are isolated from the world in a postwar Italian villa, each with subtle motives defined by Ondaatje's profound attention to detail.<br />The prose is evocative, like Almasy's comment on Kipling:  to be read slowly and then reread.  Images and scenes slowly take shape like a jigsaw puzzle.  It is not until the final few pages that we finally learn what compels Hana to tend so devotedly to the mortally-burned English Patient, it is not until the final pages that Kip reviews his dedication to the British war cause.  The characters' evolutions come slowly and naturally as Almasy's stories of the desert catalyze the entire book.<br />The movie is not this book.  Read the book - it's brilliant.	2002-05-19

Famous for his monumental buildings in Brasilia, for the U.N. complex in New York, and his reputation for failed social engineering based on a convenient sort of elitist communism.  Underwood's book is a strong introduction to Niemeyer's work, but like Niemeyer's buildings, it has flaws both in design and execution.  Niemeyer was born in 1907, and combined a Rio de Janeiro sensibility (deriving inspiration from waves, women's figures, and palm trees) with an assertively modernist approach to architecture.  Underwood points out that he went through several distinct periods: his early assimilation of architectural trends including a passion for Le Corbusier's then-revolutionary ideals; a period of introspective critical review that led to a more disciplined style (and Brasilia); followed by years of exile during the military regimes; and finally a return home as the leftist granddaddy of Brazilian modernism.<br />Niemeyer struggled with what Underwood calls the \\"Brazilian dilemma,\\" the fact that he sympathized with the poor workingman but designed for and was paid by the wealthy elite.  In fact, there really is no dilemma at all.  He was a brilliant architectural innovator, but his work contributed next to nothing to the lives of ordinary Brazilians..  He changed forever views on architecture, he breathed life into formal Corbusian structures, but his works never realized his vision of making cities more livable and egalitarian.  And the more he tried, the more uncomfortable were his creations.  He was forever dependent on the elites and politicos who commissioned his works and bent the rules to get them built.  \\"Modern architectural innovation in Brazil was the stepchild of authoritarian politics and the jeito brasileiro.\\"<br />The book is good.  The large format and excellent photos make it easy to follow the trajectory of his career (although one flaw is the lack of a useful city map or aerial photo of Brasilia).  Underwood has a good grasp of the architect's jargon, occasionally spinning off..., but generally staying on course.  Yet, [I feel] the title is a misnomer.

Fortunes can reverse in many ways, and Aristotle recognized the literary and moral value of each.<br />In the twelfth of Patrick O'Brian's wonderful series of twenty naval adventures, a combination of luck, adherence to honor, and determination turn Jack Aubrey's fortunes.  The HMS Surprise is sold out of the service - to Maturin, whose intelligence activities continue in Britain and promise a voyage to South America.  First, though, Aubrey undertakes two voyages as a privateer, under a \\"letter of marque\\", which combined with Maturin's unmasking of a spy, restore his reputation.  Maturin's private reputation has similarly suffered from false gossip about his doings in Malta (in \\"Treason's Harbour\\"), and he must similarly seek redemption in a typically private way.  So, Maturin travels to Sweden to reconcile with his wife.  This gives occasion for the reappearance of the Blue Peter diamond, and further exploration of Maturin's complicated relationship with Diana.<br />\\"The Letter of Marque\\" closes the book on many of setbacks that Aubrey and Maturin suffered recently, leaving them reunited, restored, and with their decks otherwise cleared for action in succeeding volumes.  As always, O'Brian's writing is intelligent, informed, and full of wonderful historical nuance.	2002-03-03

Aubrey, always a minnow among land sharks when he has money in his pocket, finds himself innocently ensnared in a complicated stock exchange scam that may have been set up by Maturin's enemies in the intelligence game.  The complex case and courtroom scene, O'Brian assures us in a note, are based on a real case.  The pillory scene is powerful, as Bonden gruffly clears the square of all but sailors, and officers and seamen of all stripes come to show Jack their love and respect.<br />After several books at sea, \\"The Reverse of the Medal\\" brings readers back to the Admiralty in London with its complicated and layered intrigues, back to Ashgrove and Sophie, and back to Maturin's espionage machinations.  As always, O'Brian's wonderfully intelligent prose and satisfying grasp of historical nuance captures the reader in little pockets of 18th-century Britain.  The entire Aubrey/Maturin series is great, and this installment is no exception.	2002-02-25

Their mission is to track an American ship down the Atlantic and on to the largely uncharted Pacific whaling grounds.  While \\"Far Side of the World\\" contains none of the heart-pounding muzzle-to-muzzle naval battles that readers have come to expect in O'Brian's stories, it contains lots of imaginative plot twists nonetheless.  A strange and tragic love triangle, a raft full of primitive lesbians, Maturin's disappointing visit to the Galapagos, and an oddly gripping denouement as the Surprises confront their American nemeses.  The book is entirely afloat, with pit stops to refit, but no extended periods ashore with family or engaged in intelligence affairs.  Maturin's friendship with Dr. Martin, a naturalist parson, provides comic relief at every turn.<br />O'Brian never fails to please.  This book smoothly picks up where the last one left off, and leaves a thread or two dangling to launch the next volume.  As always, the writing is brilliant and spare, the characters complex and developed, and the adventures well-researched, founded in British naval histories.  Another great voyage.	2002-02-20

It follows the fortunes of Joao Romao as he expands his business interests from small-time shopowner to upwardly striving slumlord.  Dozens of neighborhood denizens wander in and out of the story, fighting, singing, working, copulating, and dying.  The characters, dialogue, and scenery are vivid -- the slum comes alive as blacks and mulattos scramble with Portuguese and Italian immigrants to climb off the bottom of the social food chain.  Women's roles are fascinating:  virgin/prostitute, submissive head of family, object and subject.  Race relations are critically examined.  For modern readers seeking a developed plot line, the story might seem to slip off the rails.  Identified with the Realist/Naturalist literary schools, Azevedo's slum seeks to broadly describe and illuminate a social setting rather than the stories of particular characters.  Even so, the imagery is colorful and the language powerful.  Brazil's slums don't seem to have changed much in the century since Azevedo wrote about them.	2002-02-14

She and her mother and siblings are sophisticated, wealthy, and attractive when they are locked away, which helps to kindle the young reader's sympathy.  This book was written after Oufkir fled to France and told her story to co-writer Michele Fitoussi.  The story is compelling enough, filled with fantasy worlds of unimaginable wealth, it is tragic enough as a beautiful family is tossed into jail for no legal reason, and there is the redemptive conclusion as they escape and reflect on the strength of the human spirit. It's all perfect grist for a storybook for adolescent girls.  Fitoussi's prose is as breathless as any romance novel.  The plotting is a thin chronology with facts quickly forgotten and no pesky political explanations to set up the context.  The characters are all transcendently beautiful.  Not much substance for a critical reader -certainly not enough to merit a book club discussion- but lots of faraway starry-eyed romance for a teenager.	2002-01-19

This book was enthusiastically recommended to me as a modern masterpiece, but I got bored halfway through and plodded through the rest.  Written in 1939 by Russian writer Bulgakov, the notion is that the devil visits communist Moscow in the guise of a strange professor along with two cohorts.  Moscow, the center of communist xenophobia towards oursiders, is where state-sanctioned athiesm should preclude the devil's very existence.  It's cute, and ultimately touches on themes of the purpose of evil, the duality of good and evil, and political hypocrisy.  But it's written in that maddening Russian style, full of little references to obscure 19th-century literary gazettes, minor Soviet functionaries, and Goethe.  These reference, of course, are coded by self-censorship.  As a result, there are pages and entire chapters where nothing seems to happen - a guy walks around the streets, but the commentary pages in the back of the book patiently explain how the names of the streets and apartment numbers carry important, obscure references.  The commentary is good and insightful, but ultimately it really demonstrates how far the book is from its readers.  You need the commentary just to understand what's going on.  I'm told this is a great book that gets better with subsequent readings.  Maybe so.  Maybe I'll pick it up again later and give it another try.	2002-01-06

Not because they are great writers who create interesting, complex characters within compelling plots, but because they write linear, page-turning pop novels that neither require the reader to remember what was in the pages she read last night nor to think deeply about what is in the pages before her.<br />\\"The Last Jew\\" is Yonah Toledano, a [Jewish man] in fifteenth century Spain, a time of Inquisition and expulsion by Queen Isabella.  After the murders of his father and brother, Yonah avoids the expulsion, wandering the Spanish countryside until he marries, solves the crime and, um, meets a lot of people.  That's pretty much it.  Gordon has at least been to Spain and done some rudimentary research, but his grasp of the history of the society is neither deep nor nuanced.  He sets a story in a fascinating historical period, yet fails to capture any of its essence, fails to use the amazing color around his characters.  His prose is plodding with occasional clunks.  The handful of characters are sincerely drawn without being complicated.  Gordon is a technician.  He writes pedestrian novels.  If you're scheduled for a long flight or a long wait at the supermarket checkout, this would be a good book to kill the time.  If you don't like it, don't worry, you won't remember a thing about it tomorrow.	2001-12-31

Anil is a young Sri Lankan woman, a forensic scientist, educated in Britain and the U.S. who returns to Sri Lanka on a project to exhume victims of the brutal three-way civil war that randomly slaughtered civilians there in the 1980s and 90s.  Chaos, fear, and anarchy hang ominously over the story - a truck driver nailed to the road, assassinations by suicide bombers, a human rights worker who quits her job because she can no longer keep straight the details of all the massacres.  The prose is penetrating, Ondaatje's imagination is vivid.  The book is constructed as a series of anecdotes, sometimes teasingly out of order, some breathtakingly powerful, some happily trivial, that explore and illuminate Anil and the Sri Lankan brothers she befriends:  Sareth the mystical and forbearing archaeologist, Gamini the obsessively self-contained physician who thrives in apocalyptic emergency rooms.<br />\\"Anil's Ghost\\" is luminous, a book to be read slowly.  The texture of the prose is liquid on the tongue.  Anil is a powerfully-drawn complicated character.  Westernized and introspective, she resents the utter lack of privacy throughout Sri Lanka and the sympathy she feels for its people.  Self-possessed, in one of the most amazing scenes as a schoolgirl she insists on buying her brother's name and remains \\"Anil\\" ever after.  She will make you think about many things:  the insidious power of history, the gravitational pull of family and place, the futility of violence without cause,  the corrosiveness of fear, and the fatal consequences of secrecy.  Ondaatje is quite simply a great writer and this is a magnificent book, powerful, evocative, and brilliantly-written.	2001-12-30

That's a shame, because &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot; is both accessible and important, but its 420 pages may be too much for those preferring quickie books to a modest challenge.<br />Diamond, a physiology professor at UCLA, writes about the rise of civilization, or more precisely, he asks why European civilization became so advanced that it was able to conquer other continents, rather than vice versa.  The guns, germs, and steel of the title are the tools of conquest used the by the europeans, but they aren't the answer.  The question goes back even further:  assuming that humanity arose from common African ancestors several million years ago, what set of factors allowed certain european and asian societies to develop the advanced weapons, virulent germs, and modern technology they used to subdue the other continents, rather than the other way around.  Diamond jumps off from the 1532 capture of the Inca emperor Atahuallpa by Pizarro and his tiny band of Spaniards, asking, &quot;Why did Pizarro capture Atahuallpa instead of Atahuallpa capturing or killing Pizarro?... How did Pizarro come to be there to capture him, instead of Atahuallpa's coming to Spain to capture King Charles I?&quot;.<br />The answer, as Diamond patiently and capably demonstrates, has nothing to do with racist notions of intelligence but comes down to the fact that prehistoric societies in the Fertile Crescent area of the middle east were blessed with a variety of plants and animals that could be domesticated and that eurasia is blessed with a long east-west axis.  That's pretty much it.  Sounds simple?  Well, it is and it isn't.  Cogently reviewing tools, agriculture, language, ecology, and a host of other scientific fields, Diamond shows how societies that produced food surpluses became large and sedentary and developed specialized classes of bureaucrats, priests, and craftspeople who created modern civilization and all the technologies and ideologies that supported exploration and conquest.<br />The book is not a scientific thesis full of academic jargon, but is a clear historical outline for the educated layperson.  It is designed to make the reader's job easy, with chapter summaries in the prologue and wrap-up paragraphs at the end of each chapter.  One quibble:  it could be shortened by one-third without sacrificing substance.  Diamond's patient explications can occasionally be repetitive or overlong.  Readers are constantly reminded of simple truths developed in earlier chapters, so that new ideas are slow in developing.  However, the thesis itself is thought-provokingly simple and probably unique for many readers.  Quite simply, it is a new and persuasive way of looking at the world.

Henry were writing humorous and thoughtful short stories in the U.S.  In style and quality, he is closer to the simple homilies and narrow scenery of O.Henry than the pointed wit of Twain.  And like O.Henry, Maupassant died sick and dissolute in his forties. Maupassant's stories are often set in his native Normandy in northern France and populated with greedy and cunning peasants, whom Maupassant portrays alternately with affection or disdain.<br />The stories themselves vary enormously in quality, generally the longer ones are better.  In &quot;Boule de Suif&quot;, &quot;Olive Grove&quot; and &quot;Madame Tellier's Establishment&quot;, he has the time and space to patiently and subtly develop themes that paint his characters in hues of real humanity:  the prostitute manipulated, the priest with a past, the giddy hookers attending a child's first communion.  The lampoon of the rah-rah small-town booster in &quot;Madame Husson's May King&quot; [in the 1995 edition] brings a smile - the character sounds just like someone we've all met, a provincial yokel always over-eager to talk about the glories of his backwater hometown and the &quot;famous&quot; people who grew up there.  But the shorter stories in this collection are the weakest.  Some are mere trifles that must have popped into Maupassant's head and were then transcribed with no real development.  Most are wholly predictable (none of O.Henry's twists) and written in flat workaday prose.  Maupassant was a good writer, he penned a few gems, but these stories are not uniformly strong.	2001-12-11
US	51930306	RGSTJLWUAD7NQ	0880331224	509271583	The Triple Myth	Books	5	12	13	N	Y	Seminal, Balanced, and Thorough	&quot;The Triple Myth&quot; is Stella Alexander's seminal 1987 biography of Croatia's World War II-era Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac.  A difficult subject, as anyone familiar with Yugoslavia knows, precisely because he has been shrouded in myths for decades, myths that are rooted in the same conflicts that made the fighting of World War II and the 1991-95 wars in Yugoslavia so atrocious.  &quot;The Triple Myth&quot; is not pro- or anti- Croat or Serb, but a careful study of a controversial figure.  Alexander's Stepinac is neither saint nor monster, but a &quot;brave man, of piety and intelligence but with a blinkered world view&quot;.  Stepinac's story, and the myths it evoked, have been fundamental to the development of modern Croatia.  The book was recommended to this reader by both Croat and Jewish scholars in Zagreb as the most balanced examination of his life.<br /><br />The &quot;triple myth&quot; of the title conveys the fact that Stepinac was manipulated to a variety of ends.  There was the communist myth (that he was a separatist Croat who sought to undermine Tito with allegiance to the Vatican and fascism), the Serb myth (that he was responsible for the slaughter and expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Serbs), and the Croat myth (that he was a saint who championed Croatian independence and saved thousands from death at the hands of the fascists).  Like all effective myths, these are blends of fact, fiction, and propaganda.  They appeal to those predisposed to believe them and have metastisized into &quot;facts&quot; for those who still fight these battles.  Thus the myths, and the prejudices that underlie them, continue to wield tremendous power.<br />Stepinac was born to a prosperous farming family in 1898 and was once engaged, but his fiancee called it off due to his excessive piety.  He studied at the Vatican and returned to Croatia in 1931, a time of turmoil as the democratic experiment in Yugoslavia was failing and nationalists, labor unions, and Serbian royalty vied for support.  Though young and reluctant, Stepinac became archbishop of Zagreb in 1937 while the Belgrade government vainly sought to balance the  Orthodox Serbian church against the Catholic church in Croatia.  Alexander's description of the maneuvering behind the unsigned concordat in 1937 and how it stoked Serb/Croat tensions are fascinating.  Stepinac was devoted to the church and to Croatia, which he conceived as tightly linked.  These passions, and his visceral hatred for communism, left him tragically myopic about broader world affairs.  When the fascist Ustashe regime entered Zagreb in 1941 and declared an independent Croatia allied with Nazi Germany, Stepinac rejoiced both for Croatia's independence and for the regime's militant anti-communism, as well as the fact that they, like him, viewed the church as an integral element of Croatian identity.<br />The Ustashe quickly began to brutalize Serbs and Jews, organizing death camps and mass deportations to ethnically-cleanse Croatia.  Some Catholic clerics participated in these atrocities, though Stepinac's role was more ambiguous.  During the first year, he not only failed to object to the atrocities but suggested ways to make them more efficient.  In a July 1941 letter to the government he wrote: &quot;The measures undertaken would have their full effect if they were carried out in a more humane and considerate way&quot;.  By contrast, he opposed measures targetting Jews and Serbs who had converted to Catholicism, for once they became Catholics (and thus Croats), they were members of his flock.  By mid-1942, Stepinac had split with the regime, no longer believing Croatia was truly independent -it was a vassal of Nazi Germany- nor that the church benefitted from the slaughter of Serbs and Jews.  Yet he was slow to denounce the regime, feeling he would be more effective if he retained some influence and remained in Zagreb, trying to &quot;save what could be saved&quot;.<br />Tito's communiststook power in post-war Yugoslavia, beginning a relationship of mutual distrust with Stepinac that played out over many years, as each side needed but despised the other.  In his 1946 show trial Stepinac was convicted of collaborating with the Ustashe.  Noting that Tito was most interested in controlling the Catholics as all other institutions, Alexander comments that there would have been no trial had Stepinac been willing to sever ties with Rome and set up an independent Croatian Catholic church.  Sentenced to sixteen years in prison, he was released into house arrest in 1951.  The prosecution raised some valid questions that emphasized how differently Stepinac welcomed the fascists in 1941 and the communists in 1945.  Stepinac had been seduced by the fact that the fascists were Catholics.  His narrow worldview, focusing only on the church and Croatian independence, blinded him to the evils of the Ustashe until too late.  In 1952, Stepinac was elevated to cardinal, remaining a symbol of obstinate opposition to the communists until his death, still under house arrest, in 1960.<br />Stepinac's legacy is complicated.  Alexander's book does not end the debate but helps us sort facts from myths.  Perhaps history can be no kinder, nor more cruel, than to conclude that Stepinac was devoted to the church and to Croatia but was tragically flawed, a victim of his own naivete and narrow-mindedness.  He failed to be great, and his failing at such a critical historical moment makes that failure so much more tragic.ook power in post-war Yugoslavia, beginning a relationship of mutual distrust with Stepinac that played out over many years, as each side needed but despised the other.

It's not a literary masterpiece, but a quick and funny satire.  In style, it reads something like Swift's &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;, but its humor is more pointed and its satire more trenchant.<br />Candide is an illegitimate boy expelled from his adoptive home for kissing the Baron's daughter.  A simple and candid man, he resolutely adheres to his tutor's absurd theory that &quot;all is for the best&quot;.  In coming years, Candide and everyone he meets suffer tortures, rapes, slavery, and death.  Yet Candide remains ever the silly optimist, chasing the Baron's daughter around the world and giving Voltaire space to vent against the happy feel-good philosophers with their buzzwords, tautological reasoning, and empty aphorisms.  The tutor, for example, demonstrates the &quot;necessity&quot; of syphillus, as having brought chocolate to Europe though &quot;it is to be observed that this malady is, like religious controversy, peculiar to our continent&quot;.<br />Candide is a quick satire, silly and contrived, but we can read it with pleasure 250 later, long after the targets of Voltaire's wit have faded away.	2001-12-04

Many placed it among the best books they'd ever read, myself included.  A reread, fifteen years later yields a different, more muted, reaction.  The book is good, very good.  But it is not great.<br />&quot;Perfume&quot; succeeds so well because the premise is so startlingly novel.  An olfactory genius in 18th-century Paris who can make a fortune creating perfumes more complicated and subtle than any ever made, is a sociopathic monster.  Or as Suskind describes him, a &quot;tick&quot; who can roll up into a defensive ball or periodically drop himself into society.  Grenouille is a compelling and disturbing character because Suskind has painted him in such realistic tones.  Each effort to capture a new scent impels him farther, taking more chances and testing his limits, exploiting new techniques and his own criminal daring.  This is true criminal pattern and makes Grenouille terrifyingly believable.<br />But the book can not be a great one, because Suskind's prose tends toward the overdone.  Perhaps it reads better in the original German, but his maddening penchant for rephrasing and repeating the same notion and turning a sentence into a paragraph finally dulls the senses and sets the reader skimming along searching for the next important point.<br />The plot is so unique that it is brilliant.  The execution is powerful, not only in Grenouille's characterization, but also because Suskind has done his homework and is smoothly at ease with 18th century mores and the science of perfume.  But the squishy repetitive prose and unfocused paragraphs keep &quot;Perfume&quot; from joining the ranks of literary masterpieces.	2001-12-04

He followed that book with this one, the story of the hunt for mega-narco-trafficker Pablo Escobar.  \\"Killing Pablo\\" fails to measure up to the previous book.<br />Pablo Escobar was the leader of Colombia's Medellin drug cartel, brutal and uncultured, he was responsible for literally thousands of murders including senior Colombian politicians, judges, and hundreds of police officers.  He ordered a commercial airliner blown out of the air and an armed assault on the Supreme Court.  There was no crime he would not commit.  Bowden's book tracks his rise to power, his casual and ham-fisted use of violence and terror, even where more subtle means would have been more effective, and his bloody demise.<br />The problem is, at bottom, Escobar is a scuzzy little murdering drug pusher.  He's not an interesting man, and after just a few pages the awful spectacle of his cocaine empire begins to seem squalid and boring.  Bowden does a fair job of putting the reader in Medellin during the final hunt for Escobar in 1993, when a vigilante group called \\"Los Pepes\\", perhaps supported by the U.S. slaughtered hundreds of Escobar's people.  We see Colombian police and U.S. officials track Escobar to his final hideout.  But there is none of the minute-to-minute drama of \\"Black Hawk Down\\" that grabbed the reader by the throat.  This is just a story of a police operation, larger than most, but ultimately it's about cops and criminals, diverting but not particularly interesting or enlightening.	2001-11-25

Readers will imagine themselves sitting around a campfire with some grizzled Canadian soldiers grumbling about the bad food and the careerist officers and the idiot politicians, and then getting outraged at the thought that it would all be okay if only the press would write about these injustices.  Taylor sounds like a fellow who once had his name in the paper and now believes his every act and thought are newsworthy. Basically he writes about the sorry state of the small, demoralized, poorly-equipped Canadian army on a number of peacekeeping missions and then complains a half dozen times per chapter that the press hasn't covered these \\"scandals\\".  The thinking here is definitely small-bore, as there is no discussion of broader political events underlying the conflicts.  A reader drops in on several small-scale events, skirmishes, bunkers, and hillsides, in Bosnia, Croatia and Africa.<br />Taylor is unabashedly pro-Canadian, or more to the point, pro-common guy Canadian soldier (diplomacy is \\"precious and privileged\\".)  On a couple of occasions he needs to portray Americans as cowardly in order to contrast the brave Canadians who leap into the fray and save the Yanks' bacon.  On one occasion, the heroic Canadian bravely orders some Bosnians to clean up some medical waste.  While it's all for effect, it does color the text.<br />The \\"scandals\\" come fast and furious.  There is the \\"screening\\" scandal, when the effort to expand the Canadian services for the Korean conflict causes unfit persons to be accepted into the army.  There is the \\"cough syrup and coffin\\" scandal when Canadian forces in Suez were supplied with too much cough medicine and bought cheap coffins from an Egyptian vendor.  There is the \\"batteries and oil\\" scandal that Taylor calls a \\"major political embarrassment\\" when the batteries and fluids were removed from Canadian vehicles because they were due to be shipped home when the order came to deploy to Yugoslavia. Lots of funding scandals and scandals about ill-trained soldiers, useless armored vehicles, duplicitous officers, and self-serving politicians.  All are accompanied by outraged pleas for more press attention.  Ironically, on one occasion when the press covers one of Taylor's little scandals, the Canadian public couldn't care less: \\"The story [of funding shortages to the Canadian military] made national headlines but generated little public outcry\\".  Taylor is amazed that nobody but him cares about his little heartaches.  He could benefit from some perspective.<br />And readers could benefit from some maps, but the only one is a laughably inaccurate hand-drawn comic-style sketch of Croatia and Bosnia that wrongly places Bihac in Croatia, Erdut in Baranja, and generously donates Dubrovnik and southern Dalmatia to Bosnia.  If this book makes it to another edition, it could use a serious set of maps that don't look like they were drawn on a placemat.  The frequent typos and mistakes in usage don't really impact the overall text, except to suggest that the book was written by a first-time author and shoddily-edited.  \\"Palatable\\" vice \\"palpable\\";  \\"Casey Stengle\\" vice \\"Stengel\\"; \\"cap-toothed\\" vice \\"gap-toothed\\"; \\"recently sewn minefields\\" vice \\"sown\\", etc. suggest to a reader that nobody bothered to look over the proofs and leave us wondering what other mistakes may have crept in.<br />On the plus side, the descriptions of the Medak Pocket and Operation Storm attacks by the Croatian army are well-written.  While offering no perspective on the wider implications of these operations, Taylor's account does give a useful ground-level picture, particularly of the atrocities and war-crimes carried out either by or with the knowledge of the Croatian military.  Croatian commanders are now on trial both in Croatia and at the Hague Tribunal for these events.<br />Unfortunately, Taylor's apparent aim -to champion the Canadian soldier while slamming his superiors- is all for naught.  The impression left by \\"Tested Mettle\\" is that the Canadian army is badly recruited, badly trained, badly led, badly organized, in short - bad. With all of the hyperbole and Canadian rah-rah, this book is likely to appeal to the blue-collar Canadian male military wannabe demographic.  If that's you, buy it.- is all for naught.

For three months, crewmen survived in open boats, until a handful of survivors finally washed up in Chile.  &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot; is a fascinating introduction to the nineteenth century whaling industry and a peek at the clannish Quaker community that was Nantucket island.<br />The story of the Essex inspired Herman Melville to write &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, and perhaps the elements that Melville magnified are the most powerful part of the tale - the personalities of the officers.  Philbrick carefully explains the social significance attached to being a Nantucketer versus an off-islander as well as the importance of intricate old-family ties in the whaling industry.  Set against this context we have Captain Pollard, a courageous if weak commander, and first mate Owen Chase, a daring officer whose command skills improved as he shared the suffering of the men in the small whaleboats - though he was the one to convince Pollard to make the disastrous mistake of sailing eastward in the tiny boats.<br />As much as this is an introduction to whaling and a rousing sea tale, it is a story of contrasting personalities.  Men at sea live and die by the quality of their commanders, and in the story of the Essex we see them do just that.	2001-09-23

This is a great edition, the Alan Lee drawings and paintings are gorgeous, and he appeals to the Tolkien-phile with incredible attention to the details of the story. Two quibbles: one map is in the beginning of the book and the other at the end - how odd, it keeps the reader flipping back and forth. Why not just put them both up front together.

Reading it won't give you a master's degree in Shakespearean studies, but it will give you a quick and interesting overview of many different subjects.  The chapters are brief and topical: a discussion of Shakespeare's origins in Stratford, life and politics in Elizabethan England and London's theatres offer a fascinating glimpse into Shakespeare's world and works.  The second section of the book, &quot;Documents&quot;, looks at some of the primary sources for our understanding of Shakespeare, both documents from Shakespeare's life (a contract, his will, the First Folio), but also writings by those who saw the original plays, discussions of theatrical productions through the ages, and criticism by centuries of academics from John Dryden's 17th century analysis to modern feminist approaches.<br />The Age of Shakespeare is the perfect weekend read for those who want a bit of context about the plays and their origins.

Don't let the subtitle, \\"Understanding Globalization\\", cause your eyelids to droop.  The thesis is that globalization is neither inherently good or bad, nor is it a murky notion that sprang from the minds of computer nerds and investment bankers.  Instead, it is an organizing principle, a system and not just a phenomenon.  In fact it is THE organizing principle of the now and future.  A system spawned by the erosion of the political and technological walls of the Cold War. Unlike the wave of globalization a century ago that was predicated on improvements in transportation, this one is based on information technology.  Computers and the internet revolutionize everything because decisions can be made at light speed, information is freely available to all, inefficiencies are exposed, and non-democratic systems are punished.<br />In many ways, globalization is pure democracy.  Friedman persuasively argues that democratization of information, technology, and investment capital destroyed all economic models save free market capitalism.  The result is that countries find themselves in a `golden straitjacket', where the must adhere to free market capitalism, and profit handsomely from it, or whither.  Further, as more countries develop the capitalist structure, their points of competition will be their \\"software\\": effective political systems, judiciaries, schools, etc.  The corollary is that states that fail to don the golden straitjacket are making decisions against their own self-interest, and in this unpredictability lies instability and danger from states that refuse to join.<br />The book is interesting, it is certainly useful in organizing thoughts about globalization, but it is overlong.  The 475 pages in this edition could easily have been trimmed by one-third.  The problem is that Friedman's engaging anecdotal style makes the material accessible and boils complicated ideas down to simple examples; it makes the book easy to pick up and page through.  But at the same time, the folksiness makes it run on and on.  Sometimes one story blends into the next, without much thought given to the overall point of the chapter, and after a few hundred pages, the chapters seem all alike.  I enjoyed it, but too often I found myself skimming to move on and get to the next topic.and page through.  But at the same time, the folksiness makes it run on and on.

Poetic and introspective, a nose-to-nose look at the seductive horrors of the Bosnian war.  Loyd, a British kickabout backs into a job as a correspondent in Bosnia, and finds addiction, terror, and brutality that leave him discovering himself as much as he examines the warring Bosnian tribes. Loyd is a cynic, not a gee-whiz war journalist, impelled to explore the crevices in the war where the people live and eschew the cozy journalists' tables at the Holiday Inn in Sarajevo.  This is a \\"Heart of Darkness\\" account, dark and introspective, as much about his own soul and those of the people he encounters as about the depravities of the war itself.  Loyd went to Bosnia posing as a photo-journalist, but there are no photos in this book.  He later submitted newspaper stories, but there is nothing here about the causes of the war, the historical forces that created it or the policies of the various leaders who kept the coals hot.  Save war criminals like Fikret Abdic and Ivica Rajic, there are few characters here known to the outside world.  Instead, there is just Loyd watching himself voyeuristically as he descends through concentric circles of hell, \\"I wanted to reach a human extreme in order to cleanse myself of my sense of fear, and saw war as the ultimate frontier of human experience\\".  He is haunted by the supreme horrors of the Stupni Do massacre, present at the collapse of the Bihac pocket, where he articulates clearly his no-longer-guilty love of the adrenaline thrill and immediacy of combat.  The next step is a worse war, Chechnya, an unspeakable place of round-the-clock fear and destruction where even Loyd burns out in a matter of days.<br />This is a wrenching story of drugs, god, fate, and fear.  Of Loyd's struggle with his father, and his search for resolution and peace in the turmoil and chaos of war.  It is sad and powerful, awful and seductive.  An amazing book.	2001-07-22

Carkeet knows baseball, writing easily about nuance and detail of the game - to the point where a casual fan or non-fan will probably be at a loss.  The problem is with the structure.  The premise is that every member of a contending professional baseball team simultaneously falls into depression.  Hijinks follow.  Unfortunately, the narrative clicks so quickly from one character to the next, and there are nine protagonists, that it eventually becomes impossible to sort out one character from another.  I found myself paging along, not remembering which character had which peculiarity, waiting for something to happen.  Very little happened.<br />Carkeet's prose is cute, and occasionally powerful.  But the book is not particularly strong.	2001-07-21

Then, it seemed to plumb the depths of a youthful soul confronting his own fears, probing his insecurities, and testing his courage.  Now it seems like an over-written book from the pen of someone who wasn't in a war.<br />The three days of the 1863 Battle of Chancellorsville is the unnamed backdrop to the story.  Crane wrote it when he himself was only 22 years old, but that was thirty years after the battle.  His prose is the complicated verbosity of a young man with more vocabulary than ideas to fill it.  He goes on and on about things he knows nothing about and misses what he should have seen.  Had Crane been in combat, he would have found a way to articulate the inchoate images, disconnected flashes, the panicked silences shot through with deafening thunders.  He also would have captured the heart-pounding immediacy of chaos.  Instead, Henry Fleming thinks through his choices and then thinks them through again.  He rationalizes his cowardice in long complicated self-examinations.  Crane's battles are coherent things, described in orderly detail by one who has read of them and imagined them, but not experienced them.  The battle is marginal to Fleming's passage.<br />Had Crane been in battle he would have recognized that courage often has less to do with self-examination or a sudden passage to manhood than it does with camaraderie.  It is often a simple disinclination to let one's friends down.  In the story, Fleming only makes the acquaintance of two or three other soldiers, none by name.  His passage to courage is entirely anomic, individual, and alienated from the rest of his unit.  The traditional interpretation of these characters as `any men' populating the universe of Fleming's `any youth' is disingenuous.  Youths have friends, soldiers have comrades.  These define the subject as surely as his own introspection, and they do so in individualized detail.<br />Fleming's understandable fear in his first battle is somehow belittled by the extravagant cowardice of his wordy explanations.  He is a selfish whiner who, at one point, hopes the battle will be lost and justify his cowardice.  Crane no doubt chose to portray Fleming's boyish fear in stark and easy labels, so that his later passage to courage would be the more striking.  But rather than a dramatic effect, the story is merely simplistic.  The conclusion is fable-like, not credible, and therefore not of great interest to adults.  Combat fear doesn't  fade in three days, it goes on forever.  This isn't a bad book, just a simple one.  It is the story of a boy who learns to be brave.  Perhaps it's not nearly as interesting to an adult as to a teenager grappling with the same issues, but as a nineteenth century fairy tale, it may be instructive to youths.t battle is somehow belittled by the extravagant cowardice of his wordy explanations.

These maps are very useful as aids for the student, or to accompany the serious reader of any historical text.  Each map has a facing page of detailed explanatory material, which is uniformly strong throughout.  Of particular value, with exceptional text, are the depiction of the Roman Empire (#5) and the various maps of Istanbul and the Ottomans (#11, 22, 24, 25).  The Balkan Wars and First World War are explained with particular clarity, making sense of these complicated affairs in brief paragraphs.<br />Two quibbles:  the book misplaces the Croatian/Serbian border, giving a piece of Croatia along the Danube (the Baranja region) to the Serbs.  I'm sure this is a mere oversight, but the fact that this territory was the subject of a brutal war within the past decade should have given the authors reason to be more careful.  Also, while the book was published in late 1996, the final map is dated 1991, thus there is no discussion of the complicated series of wars that attended the breakup of Yugoslavia.  Certainly a second edition would be of more use to readers with a map or two on these events.	2001-07-07

On the one hand, Truman seems to be overcoming her irritating limitation in the earlier books to do little real research about Washington's institutions, but to spend too much time writing about restaurants and cocktail bars.  On the other, she shows no signs of overcoming her other, more serious, limitations.  Namely, her inability to develop credible male characters  -a debilitating handicap in a detective novelist- and thin plotting.<br />Truman clearly has done some homework about the State Department.  \\"Murder in Foggy Bottom\\" begins with the death of a Canadian diplomat in Foggy Bottom, the Washington neighborhood where the State Department is headquartered.  However, it could have used an editorial review by someone with more familiarity with the federal government.  The State Department does not have \\"divisions\\" as Truman writes, but rather bureaus.  Likewise, overseas embassies don't have divisions either, but sections.  Nobody except dime-store novelists call CIA \\"the Company\\", there are no Trade Representatives at embassies, but Commercial Officers who are employees not of the State Department, but the Commerce Department. On and on.  Truman just doesn't get the details of the federal bureaucracy right.  The denouement, where contradictions between information provided by an FBI agent and by a Russian criminal, fails miserably. No president would stake his administration on whether an FBI agent provides better information than any other source.  No, a real president would respond with caution, not hot-headed vanity to start another Waco.<br />Truman is weak at \\"guy stuff\\".  She just doesn't draw credible male characters.  This was less of a problem in the earlier books where the lead characters were women, but now the male leads are just cardboard cutouts.

They could measure their north-south latitude easily enough with simple astronomical observations, but even with all of the scientific advances of Ptolemy and Da Vinci and Galileo and Newton, there was no reliable, simple, replicable way to measure longitude.  As the Age of Exploration increased the volume of maritime commerce with vastly larger merchant and military fleets to bear it, the longitude problem became more acute.  Horrific shipwrecks in 1707 spurred Britain's parliament to establish a £20,000 prize ($12 million today) for the person who could devise a way to measure longitude accurately.<br />A decades-long race was on, and (aside from the innumerable charlatans' schemes, such as the `wounded dog' system) serious scientists soon understood that the problem boiled down to one of keeping time, precisely and regularly.  The mariner who knew the precise time in, say, London would always be able to calculate his longitude.  Thus the competition devolved into a race between astronomical systems requiring comprehensive star charts and lunar observations, and John Harrison -a working-class self-taught watchmaker with a passion for precision and a genius for invention.<br />Sobel, a science writer for the New York Times turned a series of articles into this small book, and it is a delight to read.  Harrison spent his life building four clocks, each better than the last, but the preference among the contest's judges for astronomical systems, and a nemesis named Reverend Maskelyne, undermined him at every turn.  Finally, in 1773,  King George III personally stepped in to bring some finality to the issue.  Sobel's prose keeps the pages turning, perhaps the first science book that will keep you up all night.  She explains enough science so the reader understands both the enormity of the problem and the complexity of watch making, but without burdening a reader with excessive detail or jargon. Her passion for the history of science and the precision of watchmaking is infectious.  In the final pages, Sobel describes how she cried when she finally saw Harrison's famous \\"H-4\\" clock in the museum.  When you've read the book, you'll understand why.and the complexity of watch making, but without burdening a reader with excessive detail or jargon.

US	51930306	R8OFGBHETANSE	0393037096	214446983	Treason's Harbour	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Unfinished Business	The ninth of twenty volumes in O'Brian's classic nautical series, \\"Treason's Harbour\\" ties together some of the plot threads from the previous book, \\"Ionian Mission\\", but leaves some of its own questions unanswered.  Ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin is back in the intelligence game in Malta, battling French agents and feeding them false information until he and Captain Aubrey are sent to the Red Sea.  Their mission is disappointing, though, because of a mole in the British command whose identity is unknown but who also apparently foils the mission to Algeria that ends this book.<br />Two-thirds of the way into \\"Treason's Harbour\\", readers will finally hear about the capitulation of the town of Marga, which Aubrey's crew was besieging in \\"Ionian Mission\\".  Similarly, in this book we never learn the fate of the Fieldings, he a naval officer escaped from a French prison to return to his wife and she with reputation ruined by Maturin's espionage machinations.  This is a letdown, because we've spent so much time learning about them and watching Maturin considering their fates.  We never learn the denouement of the Zambra mission but are left hanging after Aubrey has confronted three French vessels, this too is disappointing because the naval actions in this book are subdued, far less gripping than in other installments.<br />\\"Treason's Harbour\\" is a good book, skipping along with O'Brian's intelligent prose and complete ease with maritime matters, but is not wholly self-contained.  The diving bell is fun, but this reader is still wishing to know about the Fieldings.  The plot bobs and eddies but never quite runs out before the pages do.	2001-06-23

Not least because of his revolutionary inventions, insights, and discoveries, but because he was a scientist in the professional sense.  He  refused blindly to accept received wisdom, he championed the experimental approach of laboriously testing theories against observations and keeping meticulous records.  While this made him great, it also made him controversial.  Galileo's enemies were legion within academia and in the church hierarchy. Galileo scorned one nemesis, Grassi and his reliance on majority votes to arrive at truth, noting, \\"Even in conclusions which can be known only by reasoning, I say that the testimony of many has little more value than that of few, since the number of people who reason well in complicated matters is much smaller than that of those who reason badly.\\"  Today's sophists stacking opinions atop each other seeking truth about, say, global warming or AIDS could usefully read these words.  He adds, \\"I believe that good philosophers fly alone, like eagles, and not in flocks like starlings.  It is true that because eagles are rare birds they are little seen and less heard, while birds that fly like starlings fill the sky with shrieks and cries, and wherever they settle befoul the earth beneath them.\\"<br />Sobel's research and excellent story-telling skills, her smooth blending of Maria Celeste's letters with accounts of Medicean Florence throw a light on Galileo's life and times.  Caught between rigid church doctrine, expanding scientific knowledge, terrors of the plague, great dynasties, and cataclysmic wars, Galileo not only stood at an intersection of western history, but in many ways he created it.  Galileo was ambitious (cunningly plotting for a place in the Medici court), sickly (missing months and years of research and writing because of his ailments), and bored with intellectual lightweights.  He was a brilliant writer and a precise logician.  His explanations of his discoveries were as powerful as the science itself.<br />The description of Galileo's trial clarifies an event we thought we knew about.  Galileo is tired, timid, and chastened.  At 70, is is simply old.  It is unlikely that he muttered, or even thought, the words \\"Still it moves\\" as some revisionists suggest.  His book, \\"Dialogue\\", was previously twice approved by church censors, yet he was convicted at his 1634 inquisition trial for its contents. (\\"Dialogue\\" remained banned by the church for 200 years.)  He recanted, but not from falsity or cowardice, the case is more complicated than that.  The Galileo in these pages is a good Catholic who does his utmost to follow doctrine.  He seeks and abides by church rulings, knowing that his work is at the limits of its teachings.  He never mocks nor criticizes the church but venerates it.  His science becomes a tragedy as his developing understanding of the universe, based on his reading of Copernicus and his own observations and reflections, place him in an awkward position.  For what he realizes is true is different from what he wants to be true.  It is no longer enough for him to hold Copernicus' model as \\"supposition\\", he knows it to be fact.<br />This book only touches upon the more difficult question of why the Catholic church insists on clinging to obsolete theories and disproved models, undermining its own authority and turning its wisest adherents into enemies.  Or why the church should take a position in a scientific debate at all.  The church's position was one of gripping rigidly to the teachings of two non-Christians, Aristotle and Ptolemy, as well as a few isolated lines of scripture, because the hierarchy apparently decided, wrongly as it is now obvious, that Ptolemy's views were integral to the verities of Christianity.<br />\\"Galileo's Daughter\\" is wonderful.  It is a biography of a filial relationship drawn from a daughter's loving letters.  It is a window looking in on the impoverished day to day life of a 17th century convent with its concerns for lemons and pillowcases, and a far larger window looking out on 17th century Europe.with its concerns for lemons and pillowcases, and a far larger window looking out on 17th century Europe.	2001-06-22

He has interviewed dozens of Army Rangers, Delta force operators, pilots, and Somalis, combed through the archives and pieced together the battle in a running minute-by-minute chronology that puts the reader in harm's way.  This is a tough book to put down.  The soldiers are put into context, their lives, their training, their camaraderie, but are yanked out of any political picture.  They are soldiers, doing their jobs and trying to stay alive and complete a mission.  Aside from a brief epilogue, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" does not seek to characterize the broader mission in Somalia from start to finish nor frame the reason for these troops' presence in Mogadishu, nor engage in any real post-mortem.  This is the story of  a brief and now nearly-forgotten battle.  It is gory and heart-wrenching and full of chaos and noise.  It is a powerful book.  Not a political analysis but a true story of war.	2001-06-05

His account is a highly-readable thrilling adventure story - climbing snowy mountains with the Germans in pursuit, crossing streams in the night, directing parachute drops, organizing Allied supplies to the Partisans.  Lindsay's matter-of-fact prose is effective and adds credibility. He disdains the frequent Allied advisors who are overly pro-Partisan, never losing his distrust of communism.  But he clearly has a lot of respect for the Partisans' organizational skills, intelligence, courier lines, and tactics.<br />Some of the most interesting material discusses the inability of the US, UK, or Soviets to either create or find or support any indigenous resistance groups in Austria.  Why?  Several reasons, including the inescapable fact that Austrians were not so dissatisfied with the Nazi government, were less courageous than their counterparts in Yugoslavia, and were far more willing to lay low and wait for liberation rather than risk anything at all to hasten it.<br />The strongest chapters are the early ones, with Lindsay in the mountains of Slovenia, where he participates in the events he discusses.  The book becomes noticeably weaker as the war winds down and Lindsay moves to Belgrade and is kept isolated by Tito and is unable to witness much of what he reports on.  He does a game job of reconstructing events from other sources, but much of the immediacy and some of the credibility of the early material is lost.<br />The postwar political struggle for the (now-Italian) city of Trieste is fascinating.  Tito coveted the city and its Adriatic access.  The Yugoslavs were dogged, single-minded, and happily willing to engage in deceit to seize the city in the postwar settlements. Finally, Lindsay is entirely plausible in presenting the view that only the U.S.'s 1950 intervention in Korea prevented Stalin from attacking and subjugating Yugoslavia in the wake of Tito's break with the Soviet Union.<br />This is a strong book, not without flaws, but certainly enlightening and useful to scholars of the Balkans and World War II as well as to those who just enjoy a fascinating war adventure.wake of Tito's break with the Soviet Union.<br />This is a strong book, not without flaws, but certainly enlightening and useful to scholars of the Balkans and World War II as well as to those who just enjoy a fascinating war adventure.	2001-05-27

Captain Aubrey and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin return to the Mediteranean for the first time since the third book (&quot;HMS Surprise&quot;) and even have a chance to sail again in the Surprise.  Ionian Mission is really the first of two in a mini-series in which the British and Ottoman empires meet on the waves and the towns of the Med.  It is as much about diplomacy, though of a twisted devious sort, as straightforward naval action.  The Kirkus Review, above, incorrectly states that &quot;fickle westerlies&quot; take them to the Aegean (they are never in the Aegean, and the only fickle winds are the levanter that prevents their passage of Gibralter for a few days).  The book is a lively fictionalized view of the Barbary States and the tedium of the blockade of Toulon - indeed this blockade was underway five books ago.<br />O'Brian once again delivers.  Ionian Mission is a fun read, a worthy addition to the Aubrey/Maturin series.	2001-05-26

He failed to graduate from his French medical school but, rather than admit this, he spent decades pretending to be a successful doctor.  He married, had kids, bought houses, socialized with friends, travelled widely, took a lover, and lived the outwardly-normal life of a successful European yuppie.  In 1994 it all came crashing down and Romand murdered his family.  Carrere grew interested in Romand's story and the hows and whys of the &quot;monstrous deception&quot;.  However, the resulting book is far less compelling than the headlines orginally generated by Romand's lifelong lie.  Romand, it turns out, is a boring, shallow coward.  He lies about lying, even while admitting he has no reason to lie.  The reason for his deception is simple - he is a narcissistic coward too vain to face truth.  The book would be better if Romand were more interesting, but after reading his attempts to explain and defend himself, one simply grows bored with the tawdriness of it all.<br />Carrere's approach to the project begins with a sort of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; chronological reconstruction of Romand's life, but eventually Carrere injects anecodotes from his own life, assorted tangents and personal observations about Romand.  Even so, the book is slim both in size and resonance.  Romand's tale merely confirms the banal nature of evil.	2001-05-21

David McCumber - pool devotee and writer with some money to spare.  These two go on the road across North America hustling games and looking for action.  Annigoni plays and generally wins.  McCumber bankrolls his bets and sweats on the sidelines taking the notes that turned into this book.  McCumber's writing is strong, sometimes a bit too Hunter Thompsonish, but he loves the game and has a visceral sense of humor about the odyssey that could cost him a bundle.  Annigoni is a great player, but the opponents are world class and life on the road in cheap hotels, late trains, and all night pool halls is a tiring exercise.  This is a good book.  Those who play a little pool will enjoy the tense action and will be able to follow the games closely.  Those who just enjoy a book about a little-known facet of America's underbelly will be swept along.  Those who liked &quot;The Color of Money&quot; will appreciate the reality check.	2001-05-20

The idea is a good one, focus on the tourists who go to the Croatian coast.  Few tourists, after all, will visit any other part of Croatia aside from Zagreb.  But the execution needs a lot of work.  First, the ubiquitous and annoying spelling typos and awkward phrasing indicate that the book was translated into English without the benefit of an english-speaking editor.  It reads like a cheesy web page.  Second, it doesn't really have any information that the Lonely Planet Croatia guide doesn't have, and in many areas this one is inferior.  For example the maps are awful.  The map of Rijeka, for example, (Croatia's third largest city) is about four inches square and shows just a handful of sites.  It is nearly useless for someone driving into the city (notoriously tricky for non-local drivers).  Similarly, the map of Pula (a beautiful and historic must-see in Istria) is about two inches square and shows the names of about four streets and a few attractions.  The accompanying text is no more illuminating.<br />There may be room for a comprehensive guide to Croatia's beautiful coast, but without an awful lot of updates, clarifications, expansion, and improved translation, this guide can never hope to overtake the Lonely Planet guide.

It follows the now well-established formula, as Captain Jack Aubrey and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin sail smoothly from one book to the next.  This book is really two tales, two unconnected sea voyages, split by an interlude in England that feels more like an intermission.  Picking up where the previous volume left off, the two find themselves in Canada where Aubrey's behavior may surprise you.  The first voyage brings them home for the first time in many months (and three volumes).  The heart of the story is the second voyage that takes them to the Baltic for the first time (both for them and for readers) on an intelligence mission.  As the voyage ends, they find themselves in France and Maturin at his most interesting in extricating them from a dilemma and in reconnecting with Diana Villiers.<br />O'Brian is simply a great writer.  This series is not for everyone, for the prose is spare and sophisticated, the plotting both delicate enough to sustain readers for many volumes on end, yet bold enough to satisfy fans of adventure tales.  The nautical terms are easily mastered, this is not a book for sailors, but for readers who enjoy good adventure stories.	2001-04-01

So she brings a devotee's spirit of enthusiasm to her study of Branagh's treatment of Shakespeare in three movie adaptations:  Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, and Hamlet.  Like a good fan, she's obviously watched these movies a dozen times, as well as every other film Branagh has done.  Like a good academic, she lists in the bibliography every review, book, and snippet ever written about the movies from either side of the Atlantic.  The book is a light read, never profound or deeply analytical, it probes Branagh's choices of imagery and camera angle and text, much of which are related to his mission to make the plays accessible to the public.  This is a fun read, and even useful if you've just seen the movies or are about to see them again.  But it's also a bit repetitive.  Hatchuel explains the book's outline and choice of themes in the Introduction, but the chapters read like a series of somewhat disconnected observations, so that it's difficult to discern the functional difference between the last chapter and the first.  The absence of any conclusion leaves the reader hanging a bit.  The conclusions are in the Introduction, so the book's squishy organization is felt most acutely on the last page when the expected concluding remarks never materialize.  This is an interesting and quick little book for those who enjoy Shakespeare and Branagh, but it's a lot of trees without much forest.	2001-03-17

It does cover some useful intermediate material, like buying your own cue or table, how to apply english, and some useful practice drills.  But it is a curious mix of material for beginners also.  It spends too much time explaining things (for idiots, I suppose).  Explaining that balls are round and what 'cue' and 'scratch' mean.  This may be useful for someone who's never ever played a game of pool before and decides to buy a book to learn, but most readers will have to flip over lots of rudimentary explanations to get to something useful.  So, it's got all the really basic material that intermediates don't need, and lots of good intermediate material that beginners can't use.  It's also a bit repetitive, you'll find identical explanations of 8-ball and 9-ball breaks in two different chapters.  And sometimes it's contradictory, Mataya explains twice that if you miscue on the break that you can grab the cueball because the game doesn't start till the cueball hits the rack.  But in the official rules in the appendix, it seems that the game starts when your stick hits the cueball.  I couldn't figure this out.<br />Having said all this, it's not a bad book at all.  It's simple, the layout is engaging.  You can read a few pages and come back later.  You can flip around easily, the index is ample so you can quickly find what you need.  So it may be a bit schizophrenic, and it could seriously use some re-organization in the next edition, but it's not too bad at all.	2001-03-08

It is full of energy, as Captain Jack Aubrey and best friend Stephen Maturin limp into port in HMS Leopard, after their adventures from the previous book.  Aubrey learns that he is to be given a fine new ship, but must take a transport to Britain to meet her.  He never makes it.  He suffers shipwreck, two burnings, and two of the epic sea battles that O'Brian depicts so keenly that a reader is torn between reading them apace and pausing to catch some breath.  The War of 1812 with the United States has begun and the American frigate USS Constitution is building what will become an enduring historical legacy.  In Boston, Maturin meets Diana Villiers, his long-time love, and confronts shadows from his past of espionage.<br />Once again, O'Brian has combed the historical records and offered up an engaging blend of fiction and fact.  These ships did exist, the spirit of 1812 Boston is faithful and evocative.  Odd as it sounds, Aubrey and Maturin have evolved in something of a Kirk-and-Spock team.  Aubrey is all action, sometimes a bit shallow, but always gregarious and outgoing.  Maturin is stoic, deep and introspective, and always pulling strings that others can not even see but that often reach across seas and years in their reach.  They are a well-matched team, they make us smile.  This is a good book.	2001-02-24

I wanted to be impressed by the man thought to embody American probity and good sense.  But he's just another the inside-the-beltway politico, needy for praise and quick to pass blame.  Insecure, he crams in every compliment he's ever received, from a university job offer to a comment that he'd make a good vice-president.<br />Vindictive, he avenges old grudges.  He smears General John Hudachek and then Les Aspin, lacing his insults with just enough compliments to tell us he knows it's a hack-job but wants to seem fair. He comes across as a clever lawyer when he writes about Iran-Contra: \\"When the [Walsh] report came out, it said that I, too, `was privy to detailed information regarding arms shipments to Iran' during 1985.  Dead wrong.  I knew of proposals to ship missiles at the time.  I did not know that shipments had actually been made until sometime in 1986.\\"  This after he's explained how he ordered missiles transferred to Iran by the CIA.  He sounds like a word-smithing slickster trying to stay out of the independent counsel's gunsights.<br />Powell convincingly assesses the military force required to invade Panama but is out of his depth discussing politics.  His analysis of Bosnia is just intellectually lazy:  \\"What I saw from the Pentagon was America sticking its hand into a thousand-year-old hornet's nest with the expectation that our presence might pacify the hornets.  When ancient ethnic hatreds reignited in the former Yugoslavia and Americans thought we should `do something' in Bosnia, the bodies of Marines in Beirut were never far from my mind.\\"  No serious analyst would ever refer to `ancient ethnic hatreds'.  Not only is the notion thoroughly debunked by the facts, but it also displays a singular failure to educate oneself that is irresponsible in a senior policy-maker.  Worse, this excuse for inaction led to the pointless deaths of thousands of Bosnian civilians.  He adds, \\"The West has wrung its hands over Bosnia, but has not been able to find its vital interests.  No president could defend the heavy sacrifice of lives it would cost to resolve this baffling conflict.\\"  Powell is just wrong, he hasn't taken the time to understand the conflict.  After six years of U.S. peacekeeping in Bosnia, there have been precisely zero American combat deaths, the genocidal slaughter has ended, and the U.S. involvement is down to 4,000 troops.  Bosnia may have baffled Powell, but it proved susceptible to limited engagement all the same.<br />Powell never defines \\"vital interests\\", but his inability to identify any in Bosnia implies a belief that humanitarian issues aren't national interests  - a notion that might surprise the founding fathers creating a state dedicated individual rights, as well as to an American public that consistently supports overseas disaster relief and war crimes tribunals, and proud that the U.S. is respected as much for its democratic values as its military might.  The citizenry appears to have a broader view of its own `national interests' than does Powell.<br />He summarizes the Powell Doctrine:  \\"Is the national interest at stake?  If the answer is yes, go in, and go in to win.  Otherwise, stay out.\\"  The problem is that he never finds an occasion where the national interest is at stake, even when everybody else does.  After Iraq invaded Kuwait, Powell counseled inaction saying, \\"Americans do not want their young dying for $1.50-a-gallon oil.  We can't make a case for losing lives in Kuwait.\\"  He must have been the only one who could deny that U.S. national interests were at stake when Saddam was poised to control 40% of the world's oil supply.  Once the war was won, Powell decided that oil was in the national interest after all, later writing about the \\"vital interest such as we had after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the resulting threat to Saudi Arabia and the free flow of oil.\\"<br />Powell reverts to lawyering in justifying the decision to end the Gulf War after four days, repeatedly noting that everyone agreed.  Now, as Secretary of State, he'll have the opportunity to clean up his own Iraqi mess.  The gratuitous crack that even if Saddam were deposed,  he would not have been replaced \\"by a Jeffersonian a desert democracy where people read The Federalist Papers\\", is borderline obscene.  The Bush administration encouraged the Iraqi rebels, then, having done so, Powell jokes about abandoning them to die.  If he didn't find their Jeffersonian credentials up to snuff, he could have done them the favor of advising them before inciting them to revolt.<br />The Colin Powell in this book is a shadow, self-absorbed, eager to convince us he was right -even where the record is ambiguous, to avenge grudges and to bask in weak praise.

This may be the most powerful testament yet writtenabout the war in Bosnia.  Gorazde was a \\"safe area\\" in easternBosnia, much like the ill-fated Srebrenica nearby.  It was nearly -butnot quite- overrun by Serb forces, and Sacco's four visits to the townyielded up this amazing comic-style account of the war from thenarrow, pained perspective of a town under siege.  The story fits withthe format so well because it's not a chronology (like Honig's`Srebrenica'), nor a political review of the disintegration ofYugoslavia, nor a journalist's travelogue.  It's just a day-to-dayaccount -conversations with soldiers, teachers, teenage girls,refugees, with their friends and families- all the folks who madeup wartime Gorazde.  They witnessed unspeakable brutalities, attackson civilians, burning of houses, murders, rapes, gratuitous violenceby wicked men.  Cut off from the world they are bored, hungry for newsand diversion.  Sacco details these scenes and their terrible effectson the otherwise normal people of a nondescript Balkan town.  Theunforgettable man who made hours of home video of carnage and bodyparts, achieving almost sexual pleasure from watching it and screeningit for visitors; the girls in search of bluejeans and boyfriends; thesoldiers who just want to go back to the university.  Sacco placesGorazde in its historical context by reviewing the broader war, eventsin Sarajevo and Srebrenica and Dayton.  He points fingers, this is notan even-handed piece of jurisprudence, but a visit to one of the ringsof hell, whose inhabitants know precisely who is guilty for visitingthis carnage on innocents.  They know, because they were all neighborsjust months before.<br />Sacco's illustrations pack a punch.  Readerswill by turns grow tense as a group walks all night in the snow forsupplies, as a handful of men hold off a Serb column supported bytanks.  Or sad as young people describe their terrors in terms thatshow unmistakable signs of trauma and mental illness.  Or smile asSacco's new friends show courage and humanity despite their suffering.These are enduring images.  The book can be read in a few hours, andreaders will not be able to put it down.smile asSacco's new friends show courage and humanity despite their suffering.These are enduring images.

The stories are chronological picking up when the narrator arrives in country and ending with a letter he writes as he departs.  The expatriate society, with its clubby Brits, drunken eccentrics, casual racism, missionaries, and scoffing credulity of local beliefs will be recognizable to readers of Graham Greene, John LeCarre, and Joseph Conrad, but Theroux's descriptions are typically evocative: characters draw themselves (among the most memorable are the chameleon novelist in \\"The Coconut Gatherer\\", the Japanese tennis player in \\"The Tennis Court, and the medicine man in \\"The Tiger's Suit\\").  The tropical air provides a uniform backdrop of heat, jungle smells, and exotic strangenes.  The narrator neither condescends to the locals nor judges the expatriates, he merely observes in a dry prose that can sometimes be the most powerful criticism of all.  Finally, in the last chapter's private letter (perhaps the book's strongest pages) he comments at length on Squibb, the club bore, \\"He had failed at being a person, so he tried to succeed at being a character\\".  Squibb is not alone.<br />Theroux, perhaps best known for \\"The Mosquito Coast\\" and a host of wonderful travel journals, displays in these early stories a sincere voice, non-judgmental and full of wonder at seeing the new and exotic.  \\"The Consul's File\\" is short and insightful.  Worthwhile.	2001-01-02

The early books were made compelling by the science of the medical examiner, solving crimes based on clues found on the bodies - trace fibers and hairs and intriguing wounds.  However, the series has devolved into a Kay Scarpetta pity-party.  This seems like about the fourth or fifth book in a row where Kay's deep and traumatic emotional life pretty much drives the story.  The monstrous villain with the one-in-a-billion medical disorder is not new, nor are the attacks on Kay's house and office.  But her constant whining about her emotional distress, the erosion of the Lucy character to nothing but a gun-and-an-attitude, and the cut-and-paste story line make for pretty tedious reading.  Worst of all, the autopsy scenes around which the early stories pivoted have now become mere sidelines, tasks that Kay must perform between her breathless rasslin' matches with the bad guy and her teary memories of Benton.  The Scarpetta series is stale, Cornwell needs to move on to a new theme.  I've read my final Kay Scarpetta story.	2001-01-01

However, their mission is interrupted by the appearance of a nemesis, the Dutch ship Waakzaamheid, more powerful in guns and men than the Leopard, whose captain seems to read Aubrey's mind and stays one move ahead in a long-running tensely-scripted chase through the south Atlantic and into the frigid `forties'.  As usual, O'Brian's spare prose and mature style effortlessly summon the sense and spirit of life aboard a British man o'war in the early nineteenth century.  The characters, all of them, are fully drawn with human weaknesses and occasional bursts of greatness.  Like many of O'Brian's tales, \\"Desolation Island\\" is rooted in true nautical history.

O'Brian does not disappoint as Captain Aubrey and Stephen Maturin do battle against the French in the Indian Ocean.  Here the plot turns on psychological profiles.  Aubrey commands a squadron of ships, and each captain is a different study:  Pym steady but unimaginative;  Clonfert vainglorious, insecure, and unpredictable; Corbett daring but brutal; and Colonel Keating steady and brave.  And there are Aubrey and Maturin, separately and together, musing upon the different elements in each of the captain's characters.  As the action progresses, each captain is led into crisis, and each benefits and suffers by his particular choices.<br />In some respects \\"The Mauritius Command\\", at 348 pages in the Norton edition, may be too short.  Clonfert is the captain we come to know best, the others are not as fully drawn because we spend no time aboard their ships.  Also, the final assault on Mauritius is reduced to a few throw-away lines on the last page, as though O'Brian turned away from the book, unfinished, and simply chose not to write the last two chapters.  The book is a good one, O'Brian's intentions are clear.  The captains' stark choices are grounded more in their personalities than the circumstances of the struggle.  Their fates are sealed long before they join Aubrey in the Indian Ocean.  \\"The Mauritius Command\\" is a thrilling psychological study.	2000-12-13

Turkey is a great travel destination, with so much to see and so many different regions that it is difficult for one travel guide to do it all justice.  This guide does a pretty good job.  Those wanting a bit more on Istanbul would do well to check out the Eyewitness Guide or John Freely's book, especially for more historical depth and more detailed coverage of restaurants and hotels.  But this Lonely Planet guide crams in an impressive amount of useful information.  The chapters on the Adriatic coast sites (Ephesus, Kusadasi, etc.) are brief but comprehensive.  The only suggestions I would have for the next edition of this guide would be a better section on buying carpets - there are four pages here, but frankly they aren't that helpful, and most visitors to Turkey could use some do's and don'ts on the subject.  Also, many of the country maps are too small-gauge to be useful, dark and difficult to read.  The maps should be greatly expanded, both in size and number, and made brighter and easier to read.  But overall, the Lonely Planet guide is thorough and will likely be more than enough for most travelers.	2000-11-26

He suggests that the animals we know best, the cats and dogs who live in our homes, can teach us the most.  He looks closely at several categories of oft-reported -but sometimes disregarded- types of animal behavior:  predicting when their owners will return home, empathy, telepathy, sense of direction, and premonitions.  Using replicable and rigorous experimental methods he demonstrates that something indeed is going on here, something they can not be easily described by conventional explanations.  Sheldrake posits psychic connections that he calls \\"morphic bonds\\" exist among some creatures, including bees in a hive and schools of fish, and may well exist between some animals and the humans closest to them.  Sheldrake clearly explains that such bonds do not occur among all pets or even among the same pets in all situations, but they definitely do seem to exist.<br />This is a fun book for animal-lovers, full of engaging anecdotes about dogs, cats, horses, and birds who enjoy strong emotional bonds with their owners that allow them to accomplish seemingly-unbelievable feats.  But it is also an eye-opening book, for Sheldrake has applied some scientific techniques to both debunk fraudulent claims and to confirm those that have no conventional explanation.  His \\"morphic bonds\\" are persuasive, especially to those who have lived closely with animals and observed their behavior in close quarters.	2000-11-22

An easy read, it follows the trajectory of the city's fabled history in a smooth chronological rhythm with each period captured in quickie chapters of fifteen pages.  It works as an introductory history with 300 pages of chronology, and it works as a travel guide with 60 cross-referenced pages on monuments and museums.  A great primer for anyone planning a trip to the city and interested in its history, presented in a readable format somewhere between quick overview and master's degree.  The city maps in the early pages are excellently designed, and frequent illustrations are used to good effect.  Nevertheless, while the brevity of the chronology makes it an easy read, it also precludes the development of any real historical themes.  There is no deep thought here, no new views or insightful analysis, and after several dozen emperors and sultans emerge and die in repetitive procession, they begin to blur a bit one into the next.  While the birth and paroxysms of the Ottoman Empire are well-presented from Istanbul's perspective, this reader could have used a few maps of southeast Europe and the Levant to better understand the empire's development.  At the same time, events in Istanbul are not presented in the context of contemporary European events.  While this certainly helps to keep the chapters quick and readable, it also ignores the huge impact of European events on Istanbul:  the Great Schism and massive changes in Rome, conflicts with Austro-Hungary, the crusades, etc. are simply not presented even to frame events in Istanbul.  The history and research are excellent (with one tiny quibble: the battle of Kosovo Polje occurred on June 28, not June 15) but broad rather than deep.  Freely is clearly at home in the city and with the source material.<br />A great travel guide and quickie history, readable and accessible.	2000-11-20

Here she's gone beyond the limiting format (that was getting annoying in her previous books) of having a tough-as-nails but cuddly-as-a-kitten heroine solve the crimes.  The plotting in &quot;Embassy Row&quot; is much more carefully crafted, as British Ambassador Geoffrey James dies after his own party under mysterious circumstances.  This is the first of Truman's books where you won't have guessed the villain by about 50 pages in.  The characters are a bit better, but Truman's efforts at cop-talk and cop-walk still fall woefully short.  Hero Sal Morizio makes lots of dumb naive mistakes for a veteran big city detective.  He's the least credible of all the characters.  Truman also plays some of the same riffs as in her previous books:  she spends a lot of time describing D.C. cafes and restaurants, but is woefully uninformed about how government offices actually operate.  For example, there is no &quot;British Liaison office at the State Department&quot;, and CIA isn't called &quot;the Company&quot; by anyone but callow writers.  But the very worst and most annoying mistake in the book is Truman's repeated and insistent assertion that Iranians are Arabs.  They aren't, they're Muslim but not Arab.<br />Overall, &quot;Embassy Row&quot; is better than &quot;Supreme Court&quot; or &quot;White House&quot;, but there's still lots of room for improvement.	2000-09-27

It is not going to be useful to  those seeking a broad or introductory overview of the Roma.  It is  essentially a series of academic theses on sometimes obscure elements of  Roma studies. The first article is about wagon painting in England and the  second about Gypsy folktales (and it is strictly ABOUT folktales without  actually telling any folktales, but rather discussing the oral vs. written  traditions, variants, genres, etc.)  Pretty dry academic material..  The  book is narrowly confined by geographic area, with most of its articles  discussing only British Roma without useful extrapolation to Roma  communities in other countries.  If you're an advanced Roma scholar seeking  copies of colleagues' works, this may be right for you.  If you're  interested in broader information about Roma society, better to read a  different book.	2000-08-14

Captain Jack Aubrey, who made and lost a  fortune in the first book, spends this book on the run.  On the run from  France as war comes, from debtor's prison throughout, and from the  entanglements of romance.  His shotgun-approach to courtship leads to a  near-disastrous conflict with his best friend, the ship's surgeon Stephen  Maturin, whose own secret life slowly unfolds behind Aubrey's back.<br />This is a wonderful book, not a typical novel in the sense that it does  not open questions in the beginning and then answer them by the end.  Instead, it is a linear narrative that ends on a cliff-hanger just begging  for a sequel.  O'Brian's writing is crisp and spare.  The characters are  fully-developed human beings, the action is exciting.  The book is hard to  put down, but the best thing is that there are eighteen more to follow.	2000-08-10

In the first decade of the nineteenth century,  British naval officer Jack Aubrey is promoted to his first command of a  warship, the sloop \\"Sophie\\".  He befriends an eccentric physician, Stephen  Maturin, and convinces him to sail as ship's surgeon.  What follows is a  sort of odyssey, a linear narrative as the Sophie cruises the  Mediterranean, capturing cargo ships and fighting French and Spanish  warships.  O'Brian has a wonderful, mature prose, a spare style that omits  repetitious detail while allowing characters and events to describe  themselves and leaving the minutiae to the reader's imagination.  His  complete ease with nineteenth century maritime affairs, from the idiom to  the equipment is wholly convincing, yet never patronizing.  Readers  familiar with neither the sea nor the era will be swept along for the ride.  Aubrey is heroic, but three-dimensional.  He is flawed and sometimes  unlikable, courageous yet occasionally frustratingly inept.  Other  characters are drawn with equal attention to detail and humanity.  This is  a fine book, a wonderful sea story.  Norton's newly-released edition of the  entire series is attractive, and the books continue to please.	2000-07-29

Among its many  flaws:<br />Research:  the bibliography lists eight works, none less than  twenty years old, none apparently in Italian, and none primary sources.  Its seems LiPira read a handful of biographies and decided to try his hand  at it.<br />Tone: It reads like some misbegotten 1940s communist propaganda.  Garibaldi is a \\"noble leader\\" who \\"must fulfill his destiny\\".  Alternately  the \\"true messiah\\", \\"megahero\\", \\"demigod\\" and, laughably, a \\"guru of  libertarianism, so to speak\\".  We read that a \\"swell of adoration built to  a tidal wave of idolatry\\" and \\"The Neapolitans were awed by his  invincibility\\".  He is a great lover whose \\"wiry constitution enamored him  to all in the boudoir\\".  His troops were \\"feverish in their passion to  begin this momentous invasion\\" and \\"follow their glorified hero to higher  levels of achievement\\".  Pretty steamy stuff.<br />Bad guys are \\"imperialists\\"  and \\"royalists\\".  Interesting since Garibaldi renounced republicanism in  1851 and spent his career fighting for a king and for a time was dictator  of Sicily.  LiPira resorts to marxy prose to demonstrate Garibaldi's appeal  to &quot;the masses&quot;, even criticizing merchants who disliked  Garibaldi because he \\"impounds\\" their goods to feed his troops.  Garibaldi  was a brilliant general, but it's not necessary to disguise the fact that  he was also an ambitious mercenary.  One annoying riff is LiPira's strange  failure to grasp the relationship between military and political power. He  mewls about &quot;political interference&quot; and how \\"politics once again  nullified the noble sacrifice of so many gallant men\\", without considering  the political ends for which they were sacrificed. When Garibaldi once  persisted in fighting after a war had ended, LiPira acts as though he was  abandoned by conniving politicos.  Perhaps the fact that Garibaldi  disguised his lust for adventure with contradictory ideologies explains his  pathological distrust for politicians.  The book fails to engage in any  real political analysis.<br />And it is often inaccurate:  \\"Millions [in  Marseilles] were dying each year\\" of cholera; \\"Guerrilla warfare was born  in the nineteenth century\\"; characterizing ancient Rome as a society of  \\"liberated people, ennobled men, and guardians of human rights\\".  Italy  \\"failed in its first attempt to join the League of Nations\\" in 1866.  Once  LiPira has Garibaldi retreating so as not to \\"pit Italians against Italians  and lead to a civil war\\", while for fifteen years he has been fomenting  civil war by leading his Italian troops against other Italians.  The French  had \\"forty cannons, forty-eight artillery pieces, and various howitzers\\"  (howitzers are a type of cannon, and cannon a type of artillery - an odd  error in a military biography).  San Marino is \\"a small old republic\\",  without comprehending that its tactical value to Garibaldi and the very  reason that this small republic got to be an old republic is that it sits  atop a mountain without good road access.<br />Grammar: apparently English  syntax and usage aren't a part of the dental school curriculum.  LiPira  can't seem to get the hang of matching subject to verb: \\"weakness and  fragility was evident\\".  Readers will enjoy the inventive usages:  \\"abstract poverty\\" (vice abject), \\"offshore\\" (vice onshore),  \\"reactionaries\\" (vice revolutionaries), and \\"lie\\" as the past tense of  \\"lie\\", as in \\"Garibaldi lie in a stupor\\".<br />Some phrases are nearly  incomprehensible:  \\"ethereal personification\\",  \\"obvious casualties\\", \\"It  took until June for the sailing of the Neapolitan army to depart\\", \\"his  talented saber in hand\\", \\"Garibaldi presented the taking of Venice via  Dalmatia and the Balkans but with governmental ties.\\" in a battle, his  \\"ammunition dwindled to an embarrassing minimum\\", \\"He was adamant in his  belief that life is not for the privileged\\", \\"each town they passed was  more friendly than the next\\".  The death of Garibaldi's beloved wife's is  described as \\"unwelcome\\".  For good measure there are ethnic slurs:  \\"subtle\\" Sicilians and \\"warlike Prussians\\".<br />Readers will get a kick out  of the redundancies:  \\"freedom and liberty\\", \\"violent battle\\", \\"due to his  recuperative powers, he recovered.\\", his biography included an \\"episode  from his life\\", \\"more incessant\\", \\"a ditch that served as a trench\\", \\"long  two month voyage\\",  \\"both fear-inspiring and terrifying\\", \\"aggressively  attacked\\",  those killed are \\"lost forever\\", \\"raves and adulation\\", \\"the  royalist king\\", \\"disarray and disorder\\", and \\"prior history\\".  LiPira is  compelled to state the obvious:  \\"Little did he know what the future had in  store\\", an attack was \\"designed to disable the enemy and bring victory\\", he  patiently explains that computers did not exist in 1807, and later that the  Statue of Liberty (not yet built) \\"had not gained [its] place in history,  as yet\\".<br />e.e. cummings once teased Warren Harding for writing a sentence  with seven grammatical errors.  LiPira has created the biographical  equivalent, cramming all this into a mere 120 pages.  So, while it reads  like a vanity book published by a hobbyist writing in his den, at least it  doesn't take very long.

Because there is no shortage of material, Wilson has focused on ten themes,  including how he educated himself, how he entered politics, his relations  with women, and particularly with Mary Todd, etc.<br />The problem is that  it's not clear for whom Wilson is writing.  Wilson himself declares that  the book is not for academics, but who else would be interested in a work  that is less about Lincoln than about stories about Lincoln?  Few of the  legion Lincoln fans, save scholars, would have the interest or the patience  for a tedious historiography and word-by-word analysis of obscure letters  and notes about the life of their subject.  For example, the first chapter  examines a wrestling match Lincoln had at age 22, and fully describes the  match and its significance in three interesting pages.  The problem is the  chapter goes of for 33 pages, citing dozens of sources, including  eyewitnesses as well as later biographers, analyzes differences in their  accounts of the match, and weighs them against each other for credibility.  This approach may be a useful \\"how to\\" for amateur historians, but most  readers would likely prefer more history and less  methodology.<br />Fortunately, the first chapter is the toughest sledding.  The subsequent ones follow the same pattern, but are far more readable,  relying less on Wilson's interior dialogues on reliability and veracity.  Lincoln's character slowly and arduously emerges, and Lincoln fans with the  patience to wade through will find loads of interesting detail, such as on  his surveying and early political careers.  Wilson also excerpts snatches  of Lincoln's favorite poems (Burns, Byron, etc.) to excellent effect in  demonstrating both source and reflection of Lincoln's state of mind.  The  speculation on his melancholy and on his tragic romance with Ann Rutledge  are well worthwhile, if a bit tedious.<br />The book is a good one, but could  be much better.  Perhaps Wilson will follow up with a book of half the  length giving a detailed and straightforward history of this fascinating  period in Lincoln's life based on the conclusions from this work, but  omitting the tedium and repetitionrating both source and reflection of Lincoln's state of mind.

Most Americans' grasp of  the battle boils down to a few factoids:  Andy Jackson won, pirate Jean  Lafitte helped, and the battle was fought after the treaty marking its end  (the Treaty of Ghent) was signed, but before news of the treaty reached the  new world.  Remini's success is in providing a wonderful and interesting  background for the events of the battle:  the polyglot and stratified  society of New Orleans; continued British designs in North America even  after the American colonies won their independence; and most starkly, the  stalwart, near fanatical patriotism of Andrew Jackson.<br />The British  campaigning is well recounted, from attacks at Mobile Bay to the laborious  transfer of troops through the Louisiana bayous, to the final disastrous  assaults on entrenched American lines.  This book is informative without  being overly-dense to a newcomer to the material.  A must-read for  Americans who've let the battle and its significance slip from the national  consciousness.  Remini does pay a bit of lip service to the British by  doing some research on their commanders and setting them in the context of  their career paths.  He also wraps up by noting that the Battle of New  Orleans was, for decades, seen as a defining coming-of-age moment for the  young American republic, it launched Jackson to the White House and was the  final and true declaration of independence for newly-empowered  Americans.<br />However, Remini's unabashed flag-waving and affection for his  hero create some awkward passages.  Time and again he gnashes teeth at  British arrogance and nearly weeps at the ragtag nature of the American  army, held together by the immense will of great Jackson.  At times the  book borders on hero worship and veers away from analytical  political/military history.  So that in the end, this is a readable and  interesting history, but a flawed one.  An informative ride to the gates of  New Orleans, but one taken from the American side.hero worship and veers away from analytical  political/military history.

US	51930306	R39AECYX825M4	2831506751	971278237	Discover Italy	Books	1	1	2	N	N	A Failure	This is a weak travel guide, and you'll probably find yourself in mid-trip  buying some other guidebook, plus a fistful of maps.  The information in  the book is organized inefficiently, keeping the reader fluttering this way  and that trying to find restaurants and historical information.  The hotel  listings are abysmal, consisting of one or two places for most cities, some  with information that was dated at publication time.  The restaurant  listings are worse, author Altman is, at best, a peculiar and reluctant  gourmand.  For example the Notai restaurant in Bologna that Altman calls  \\"elegant, serving excellent regional cuisine\\" is strictly average, with the  same menu as dozens of other good, but undistinguished, places in the area.  The only other restaurant he mentions in Bologna is a trattoria,  indicating to this reader that he only spent one day in the city, had lunch  and dinner, and left us with these two meagre entries for the center of  Bolognese cuisine.<br />On the other hand, the best restaurant in Genova, as  any taxi driver or concierge can tell you, is a seafood house in the port  area called Vittorio's - a fun and popular place with amazing food.  The  only restaurants Altman mentions are one nice place outside of town  (unappealing since driving in and around Genova is a nightmare), and, of  course, a trattoria.  Sounds like Altman had one lunch and one dinner in  Genova also.  The book simply fails to mention the wonderful Aquarium that  is Genova's best tourist attraction, although it may not have been open  when Altman visited.<br />Beyond these critical failures in restaurants and  hotels, Altman fails to provide important information about parking, mass  transit, store and restaurant hours, etc.  There are no useful road maps or  city maps, so it is often impossible to get to a desired location within a  city without another guidebook.  Even when describing attractions, his  prose is sodden and self-important, as when he argues with Napoleon's  characterization of Venice's St.Mark's square as Europe's \\"finest drawing  room\\".  No, says, Altman, \\"this is no drawing room, Bonaparte, it's a great  piece of Italian theatre\\".  Give me a break.  Speaking of Venice, imagine a  guidebook that fails to explain how to park a car and catch a water taxi in  a city famous for banning land vehicles.<br />Guide books cost so much money,  and there are so many out there on Italy, do yourself a favor and buy  another one.

In fact,  you can buy the guide for the restaurants alone and not be disappointed.  Each is described in detail with suggested dishes and pithy comments, and  each is marked on the map.  Marking restaurants on the street map is not  usually done in travel guides, but is so helpful, because as you find  yourself in a particular neighborhood yearning for a good meal you can  simply turn to the page and locate a number of nearby eateries.  This  avoids the awkward and time-consuming ordeal of locating restaurants by  street address.  I fully concur with editor Kahn's priorities in mentioning  the touristy Spanish Steps in a few lines, but spending six insightful  pages on the stunning Borghese art gallery.<br />This is not a stand-alone  guide, as it lacks information on hotels and other important travel  information (transportation, embassies, currencies, etc.), but it is a  brilliant and useful tool for those who already have a standard guide book  and would like a bit more, or for those who are already familiar with Rome.	2000-07-09

Fortunately, this companion is delightful  for longtime fans as well.  Epstein discusses twenty-three of Shakespeare's  thirty-six plays (unaccountably skipping `Julius Caesar' because, she says,  \\"I don't like it and felt it was time to give the play a rest\\".  She offers  the most insights into the best-known tragedies (35 pp. on Hamlet, 24pp. on  `Othello', and useful thoughts on the difficult `Tempest'), and discusses  film adaptations, actors, the cult of Shakespeare, puns, sex, and the  Elizabethan era.  In short, she provides wonderful, readable color to  enhance plays that many have read over and over and others have avoided all  their lives.  Divided into a series of accessible articles of a few pages  each, the book need not be read in any particular order.  Thumb through and  you'll find something to catch your fancy.  Thumb through again tomorrow,  and you'll find something else.  Epstein is a great place to start before  seeing or reading a play, and if you don't have tickets for a nearby  production, reading this book will induce you to fall in love with  Shakespeare or remind you why you fell in love the first time.	2000-06-18

A fellow who tries too hard to be a tough-guy New York scribe, a hard-boiled Jimmy Breslin been-there badge-out type, who uses too many gratuitous obscenities and throwaway racist insults.  A guy  who writes in his own cover-blurb bio that he was \\"schooled in his father's  bar...and his poetry readings are legend.\\"  Give me a break.  He wastes a lot  of over-research trying to set a dark mystical ambience for this Liston  bio, so we get pages of pseudo-Joseph Conrad stuff about Dahomey slavery  and Mississippi Choctaw, boll weevils and a 5th century bishop.  Show-off  meaningless riffs on Janus the god and Aristotle on slavery.  Of course,  this from a guy who thinks Aristotle is a \\"pillar of Judeo-Christian  thought\\".  Who gives us three pages on the history of slavery as he  contemplates Liston's condition like he would his own navel.  Yawn.  And  then a bunch of hard-guy talk about God's \\"white a**\\" and racist nonsense  from an oh-too-black white guy, despite his comment that Liston was  remarkably free of racial prejudice.<br />Finally, about fifty pages in, we  get to Liston and his boxing career.  If you've made it this far, you can  make it to the end.  Tosches' research has yielded infinitely more about  dozens of long-forgotten hoods than about Liston himself, what he thinks,  what he says.  The fights are barely mentioned at all.  But just when  Liston's life gets interesting, Tosches lapses into another unreadable  passage about wind and blood and incomprehensible tough-guy jargon that  must pass for profundity at Toshche's `legendary' poetry readings.  He  twice mentions, apropos of absolutely nothing, that Joe Kennedy earned  dirty money, calling JFK \\"the brat offspring of a criminal fortune\\".  Wha?  Why is that here?  It doesn't even rhyme with the line before it.<br />He has  lots of unsupported conspiracy theories.  \\"America did not want Sonny as  her champion\\", the Black Muslims \\"got to Sonny\\", this after earnestly  explaining that \\"Islam was a religion of slavery\\" (p.217).  Finally, with  no evidence except his own attitude, he opines that \\"to accept the premise  that Sonny was murdered is, by necessity, to accept the involvement and the  malfeasance of cops in that murder.\\"  Um, ok, Nick.<br />Strangely enough, the  book is not an utter failure.  Sonny Liston as a character is so outsized  and compelling that he manages to seize the reader's interest in spite of  Tosches' very best efforts to reduce the story to nonsense.

In \\"Murder on Capitol Hill\\" Truman has a surer grasp of character and plot than in \\"Murder in the White House\\", but her research is  still done from memory and the story is predictable.  Senator Cale Caldwell  is murdered at a party, leaving readers a finite number of suspects as  heroine lawyer Lydia James leads the investigation.  Truman gives us an  interesting and well-drawn array of suspects, but most readers will have  worked out the plot halfway through.<br />As in \\"White House\\", Truman relies  heavily on her Washington memories rather than researching new ones.  So  instead of interesting and detailed insights into the Senate's back rooms,  we get a lot of chats in restaurants and bars.  Despite its title, there is  very little description of Capitol Hill.  Readers interested in juicy  insider insights will be disappointed.  With a few pen strokes, the book  could be set in any city.  A quick read, not bad, but lots of room for  improvement.	2000-06-13

The cries of a madwoman on an Auschwitz-bound cattle car are just one of many portents shepherding doomed souls on their way to Nazi furnaces.  In \\"Night\\", the first of three books in this collection, Elie Wiesel recounts  his deportation to the death camps where the rest of his family perished.  The tragic weight of his witness to this obscene cruelty burdens the reader  with the fates of the inmates and his reflections on the meaning of evil.  Wiesel questions his god and his faith.  He sees sons kill fathers:  \\"Meir.  Meir, my boy! Don't you recognize me? I'm your father... you're hurting me...  you're killing your father!  I've got some bread... for you too... for you  too...\\" (p.106), and becomes intimate with death.<br />In \\"Dawn\\", Wiesel has  migrated to Palestine and faces the duty to execute a captured prisoner.  His long night of contemplation and uncertainty exposes his preoccupation  with killing and killers and again with death: \\"Death,\\" Kalman, the  grizzled master, told me, \\"is a being without arms or legs or mouth or  head; it is all eyes. If ever you meet a creature with eyes everywhere, you  can be sure that it is death.\\" (p.140).  It is a preoccupation to be  squeezed only from one who has not fully lost his faith or his humanity.  A  beggar explains the face of the night:  \\"Listen,\\" he said, digging his  fingers into my arm.  \\"I'm going to teach you the art of distinguishing  between day and night.  Always look at a window, and failing that look into  the eyes of a man.  If you see a face, any face, then you can be sure that  night has succeeded day.  For, believe me, night has a face.\\" (p.126)  Fear, night, suffering, and evil are his companions, and he explores them  constantly.  \\"Being afraid is nothing.  Fear is only a color, a backdrop, a  landscape.\\" (p.174).<br />Until, in \\"Day\\", he survives a terrible accident  and is faced with his own complacent acceptance of mortality.  He struggles  with the urge to explain to his talented young doctor the futility of  fighting against  death, and reaches an epiphany when he understands the  tragedy of splashing others with his suffering.  \\"Suffering brings out the  lowest, the most cowardly in man.  There is a phase of suffering you reach  beyond which you become a brute:  beyond it you sell your soul - and worse,  the souls of your friends - for a piece of bread, for some warmth, for a  moment of oblivion, of sleep.\\" (p.247).<br />These stories are powerful and  frightening,.

Larner explains why Polo's book is an extraordinary achievement, not  because it is a great diary, nor because Polo was a particularly perceptive  observer, but simply because it was written at all when so little hard data  was coming from the East, and thus the broad influence it had on the West.<br />In one passage (p.85),  that could usefully have come earlier, Larner  explains, \\"...Who is Marco Polo?  He is not an adventurer, a merchant, or a  Christian missionary; he is rather a minor Mongolian civil servant who  during his years in the East has been an observer or student of the  topography and human geography of Asia, of its customs and folklore, of,  above all, the authority and court of the Great Khan, all seen from a  Mongol point of view.  Then, having taken early retirement, he has sought  an audience for his memories.  Marco left Venice in 1271 at the age of  seventeen.  He returned in 1295, twenty-four years later, aged forty-one.  Take these facts, together with a truly remarkable feature of the Book:  that in describing the eastern world there is no evidence of culture  shock.\\"<br />This is a book for scholars, for those who have read Polo's work.  The endnotes and bibliography extend for almost fifty pages, revealing to  the novice the existence of an entire academic sub-stratum devoted to the  study, debunking, and defense of Marco Polo.  Larner analyses Polo's book  and its importance, rather than Polo himself or the importance of his  voyage.  Readers interested in a voyage almost unimaginable in today's  small, well-charted world should start with Polo's book itself, whose very  simplicity and dryness inspired Larner but may put off newcomers.<br />Several  years after returning from the East,  Polo dictated the book to a cellmate  in a Genoese prison.  Thereafter it was translated and copied dozens of  times, with each subsequent interpreter adding his own biases atop Polo's  simple prose.  Illustrators drew fantastic creatures of the East that Polo  never mentioned.  As a result, many scholars grew convinced that Polo never  made it past the Black Sea and the book was a pack of lies.  Larner does a  credible job debunking these ideas, although he tends to fall so in love  with Marco that his own defenses can appear  manufactured, as on p.64 when  he ascribes an obvious falsehood in Polo's book to his co-writer's attempts  to spice up the text.  Perhaps Polo lied, or forgot, or the co-writer  misheard, but we have no way to know; there is no evidence one way or the  other, and this reader wondered whether Larner's attempts to excuse Polo  indicated that he had surrendered his objectivity.  On another occasion  (p.102), he explains away Polo's virulent anti-Muslim prejudices by  suggesting these views are not really so extreme and, in any case, were  part of the contemporary worldview.<br />The book is a good one, not without  flaws, but instructive, interesting, and eye-opening.  The maps and color  illustrations are gorgeous, and Marco Polo himself is such a compelling  figure that it is simply interesting to read more about him than he reveals  in his own wordsGenoese prison.

Truman hasn't yet shown her best chops.  Relying mostly on her personal recollections of White House, she crafts a  reasonably good story, albeit with a predictable solution.  Most readers  will have guessed the President's big 'secret' fifty pages before the  protagonists do.  The inside scoop on White House is, not surprisingly, the  strongest element.  The rest is sodden and a bit weak.  Truman shows no  knowledge at all of the State Dept, guessing that the Secretary of State  has a receptionist and a telephone log, as though the Department is run  like a high school principal's office.  Other agency heads, the Director of  the FBI, CIA, etc. seem to be go-fers.  Even our hero Ron, the President's  Special Counsel, fails to spark much interest.  He seems to be an okay guy,  but is flat and undeveloped as a character.  Truman didn't do her homework  for this book, and she hasn't yet developed as a solid writer - either for  plot or characterization.  As a first effort in a series that gets much  stronger over the years, Murder in the White House is not too bad.	2000-05-14

The accounts of race relations in the sport, the maintenance and collapse of the Yankees dynasty, scouting, and the  minor leagues are windows into baseball's past and its legacy to America.  The stories of Mickey Mantle's decline, Bob Gibson's intensity, and Lou  Brock's focus are compelling and personal.  The pennant race and world  series are told in clinical detail, but are surprisingly devoid of passion  given the long sweet windup of the early chapters.  The book is a must for  baseball fans, but optional for all others.  It runs along slow and easy,  like a Sunday double-header, with elongated prose and steady pace.  It  could be a hundred pages shorter and appeal to a broader audience, but  perhaps the book is like baseball itself, that the man once said is only as  boring as the person watching it.	2000-05-10

Therefore its brevity must be considered a virtue, as most readers would not have the  patience nor the interest to wade through hundreds of pages on medieval  Balkan history.  However, it does not provide anything more than a series  of dates and vaguely connected events until hitting its stride in the 20th  century.  Left largely untold are the fascinating stories of Croatia's more  distant past.  Tomislav, the first Croatian king who ushered in early  westernizing influences merits but six vague lines, while Jelacic, the  tragic nineteenth-century hero gets more attention but Goldstein fails to  describe either his military campaigns or the fascinating story of his  decline and death.  Readers who know nothing of Croatia will find little in  the first hundred pages to capture their attention, and readers with some  background will find nothing new to pique their interest.<br />The chapters on  the twentieth century are the strongest.  The spare descriptions of World  War II, post-war politics, and the recent wars in Croatia and Bosnia are  clear and unclouded by gratuitous political partisanship.  A passage  (p.187) debunking the popular myth that Tito somehow 'solved' Yugoslavia's  ethnic problems is particularly insightful.  Goldstein is clearly a  Croatian patriot, but he is no nationalist and no apologist for Tudjman's  corrupt and hateful brand of politics.  He criticizes Tudjman and Milosevic  and the Krajina Serbs equally.  The book would be stronger had the first  hundred pages been reduced to a quick overview, and the subsequent chapters  on the 20th century expanded and strengthened.<br />The book is a good one,  more pointed and less partisan than Marcus Tanner's.  The maps are  generally good (a county chart showing Serb minority populations in 1991,  and a map explaining Operation Storm are excellent), with the exception  that there is no map on the Bosnian war, although there is a chapter  devoted to it.  The translation is generally strong, but the book is filled  with typos and editorial oversights (&quot;till&quot; to mean  &quot;until&quot;, awkward sentences, and frequent misspellings).  The  strength of this history is its balance, the weakness is its lack of  anecdote or interesting color.at there is no map on the Bosnian war, although there is a chapter  devoted to it.

The plot turns on a blockbuster Caravaggio exhibition at the National and bounces  from Italy to Washington and the underground world of stolen masterpieces.  Truman's series of crime novels set in Washington ring true to anyone who  has spent time there.  She knows the neighborhoods, the restaurants, the  atmosphere, and the attitude.  But the novel is only average.  The pages  keep turning, the characters are thinly-drawn, and the plot is adequate.  The story is overlong.

In the cover blurbs and the author's note and the bio page, her greatest credential is the five years she spent as a junior officer in the U.S.  foreign service,.  What she doesn't reveal is that as a junior officer, she  spent two years in San Salvador stamping visas into passports, dozens each  day, the bureaucratic equivalent of flipping burgers.  As a junior  personnel officer in Poland, she spent two years reading regulations about  sick leave and salary grade levels.  She brings all of this talent and  experience to bear in Twelve Drummers Drumming.  Her purported detailed  understanding of the inner workings of the State Department in Washington  (where she never worked) consist of two facts:  that S/CT is the name of  the counter-terrorism office and INR is the name of the intelligence  bureau.  These are tidbits anyone can get out of the phone book.  Beyond  that she really has no insights at all about what goes on behind the scenes  in Washington or in overseas embassies.<br />However, her puffing up her  resume is nothing new in publishing or any other field.  It would all be  quite excusable if only the book was a good one.  Unfortunately, it's not.  Casey Collins, the herone, shares many of the author's resume bullet  points:  El Salvador, Poland, Denmark.  We can only hope that the Collins  character didn't also inherit her creator's personality.  For Collins is a  whiny self-absorbed bore.  She thinks in puerile simplicities, she is  breathlessly in love or dangerously heartbroken.  Childishly shocked by  this or that perceived insult, convinced by the heavenly purity of her  love, mewling about how difficult are her life and her mission, getting  into ridiculous situations like a blind kitten and then pouting that she  has no way out of her predicament.  The premise of the book is promising,  but the writing is unimaginative, the characters uninteresting, and the  plot unconvincing.

Levi capitalizes on earlier research, debunks many of the more fanciful theories about the bard, sorts through the legends (who really wrote the plays; Shakespeare's  gay lover; etc.) and provides a balanced, lively, and readable account of  the Elizabethan period, life on the stage, and the origins of his writings.  The latter is where Levi shines.  He examines dozens upon dozens of texts,  contemporaneous, ancient, obscure, and well-known to identify the sources  of the works.  He goes through the plays one by one with pithy comments on  sources, themes, and the social and historical context for each.  He has a  tactile understanding of poetry and what makes Shakespeare great.  His is a  patient scholarship, respectful but not reverent.  The biography is  engrossing.

For Lincoln was an out-of-size character whose  personality and achievements were instrumental to the shaping of modern  American society.  This book is part breezy travelogue and part  under-researched biography.  It is not a great book, it contains too many  factual errors, and the author's understanding of nineteenth century  American history is too shallow for this effort to find a place on the  shelf of the serious Lincoln scholar.  For example, Ms. Morris writes that  the Mason-Dixon line came about in the 1820s as a product of the Missouri  Compromise, whereas in reality it was surveyed sixty years earlier.  She  cites well-known and easily-verified quotations inaccurately, she accepts  discredited Lincoln legends at face value, and perhaps worst of all she  misunderstands the fundamental meaning of the Gettysburg Address.  Yet, for  all that, the book is a likeable one.  Morris is up-front about her  prejudices, airily unconcerned about her lazy research methods, and  frequently contradictory in her opinions and conclusions.  By the end, she  must admit that she doesn't quite know what to make of Lincoln, although  she frequently evinces affection and respect for him.  This is not a  serious book, but it is fun, particularly for the many readers whose  understanding of Lincoln is greater than Morris's, and who will enjoy  revisiting him with fresh eyes.	2000-03-15

But this book is no Hamlet.  This is a light and quick read, a stray speculation revolving  around Gertrude and her affair with her husband's brother that precedes the  action in Hamlet and culminates with Claudius's telling of the play's early  scenes.  It is fun because it illustrates just how fully do Shakespeare's  moral perspectives on Claudius's treachery, Gertrude's perfidy, and  Hamlet's callow innocence color our interpretation of the events in  Elsinore.  Updike shows us that there is another way to accept the  characters.  \\"Putting aside the murder being covered up, Claudius seems a  capable king, Gertrude a noble queen, Ophelia a treasure of sweetness,  Polonius a tedious but not evil counsellor, Laertes a generic young man.  Hamlet pulls them all into death\\".<br />Of course, the murder and its  cover-up are precisely what Shakespeare refuses to \\"put aside\\", and resorts  to the stratagem of the talking ghost to reveal the otherwise perfect  crime.  Shakespeare's story of unnatural deceit and its cleansing through  the shedding of the blood of both guilty and innocent is thrilling and  profound precisely because of the weight of its moral judgements and the  depth of its characters.  Updike gives us the latter without the former.  He deftly and patiently draws the characters of Hamlet senior, Claudius,  Polonius, and Gertrude so we can plainly see their motivations and, by  default, we may accept their choices as natural, if not honorable, ones.  It's a not terribly seductive game, to excuse fratricide because the victim  is a bore whose wife deserves better.  In the end, Shakespeare got the  moral compass about right.  Updike's Claudius and Gertrude are pathetic,  but hardly sympathetic.  The book is a fun read, because it turns Hamlet's  characters on their heads and lets us examine them from a new angle, but  I'll reread Hamlet before I reread Updike.ad Hamlet before I reread Updike.	2000-03-12

The overall theme, that voluntary migration - including for purposes of prostitution -  is inextricably linked to, and sometimes indistinguishable from, traffic in persons, is  powerfully presented with case studies gleaned from field research  conducted in Thailand.  Rural Thai women are engaged in sex work in  Bangkok, Singapore, Japan, and Germany.  The difficulty in addressing this  phenomenon is that some are trafficked against their will and suffer from  the most appalling conditions of fear, abuse, and inhumanity, while others  voluntarily enlist as prostitutes, driven by a combination of poverty and  lack of opportunity at home and greed fueled by misinformation for what  lies before them.  The book is wholly successful with this thesis.<br />But  the problems are two-fold.  First, there simply is not enough depth to  warrant even 116 pages.  While the material is divided thematically, many  stories are repetitive and do not add to the reader's understanding.  The  second, and more serious, problem is the authors' political agenda.  While  not oppressive, the anti-western theology is certainly intrusive.  There is  the use of 1970s-era jargon, referring to developed nations as \\"North\\" and  the rest as \\"South\\", and predicating these labels with the assumption that  South is good and North bad.  There is the subtext that traffic in persons  is essentially an economic problem - a migration issue - caused by unfair  \\"Northern\\" economic exploitation and by discriminatory immigration laws  that prevent citizens of the \\"South\\" from travelling at will to developed  countries to seek their fortune.  There is the imperfect understanding of  economics compounded by a sort of pseudo-socialist template that yields  incorrect statements like: \\"The need to import foreign labour into  industrialized economies has now vanished\\" (p21); or callow outrage: \\"In an  era of allegedly free markets, to permit goods, capital and rich people to  move freely around the world, while preventing labour from doing so,  appears both hypocritical and unjust\\" (p22).  Japan is criticized because  its standard of living serves as a \\"magnet\\" to those who live in poor  countries.  As though Japan is at fault, and the girls, even the willing  prostitutes, are sad victims of Japanese success.  This book is not the  best forum to discuss uneven economic development, and the authors should  have left it alone.  Instead, there are odd statements like, \\"migrants  represent the commitment of the nation to participate in the international  economy\\" (p23), which suggests illegal migration and prostitution are  positive economic policies of source countries, rather than the recognition  that illegal migration represents a failure by these countries to provide  for the needs of all their citizens.<br />Some phrases are ill-chosen,  \\"Trafficking in women not only breaches the criminal and many other laws,...\\"  (p66).  Others are simply bizarre, such as the discussion of wives living  abroad as prostitutes.  The authors aver that when husbands of the  prostitutes date other women and waste the proceeds of their wives' labors,  that \\"such behavior contributes to the high divorce rate\\" (p75).  It is  just odd to blame the husband of a prostitute for the marriage's failure.<br />Overall, the book is a success.  Its thesis is powerful, but the  language is sometimes disingenuous.

It is a chronology with, at its core, a blow-by-blow and sometimes hour-by-hour description of the summer and  autumn of 1995 when the Dayton accords took shape.  The book is  oft-criticized as Holbrooke's attempts to win back the swarms of people he  alienated with his abrasive personality during his return to public  service.  If that was his intent, he probably failed, because his  much-publicized anti-social behavior continues unabated to this day.  In  the unlikely event that any of his enemies were gullible enough to be  flattered by the book, Holbrooke has no doubt subsequently given them fresh  reason to dislike him.  However, the book is still important, and, while  self-aggrandizing, Holbrooke is possessed of a certain clarity of vision  regarding the balkan wars.  His list of five reasons, in chapter 2, for the  West's failure to intervene in Yugoslavia is perceptive, especially his  remarks about \\"Bad History, or the Rebecca West factor\\".  The depiction of  Milosevic is consistently interesting.  Milosevic's own sorry history of  losing four wars in the space of nine years, and the undeniable ruin he has  visited on his own people, tend to paint him in broad and inaccurate  colors. Holbrooke's account of his many sessions with Milosevic show the  Serbian dictator as ruthless and cunning, and ultimately without any  passion or vision.  Milosevic was never interested in \\"greater Serbia\\", he  sold the Croatian Serbs in a heartbeat.  His betrayal of the Bosnain Serbs  at Dayton, and the utter contempt he felt for them, marks him as a ruthless  machiavelli rather than a true Serb nationalist.  The book is useful, but  not without minor blemishes:  some explanations reek of hindsight, such as  the decision (p.166) not to allow Croatian forces to conquer Banja Luka in  1995.  Holbrooke's pasted-on humanitarian concerns ring hollow.  The  strategic implications of such an attack, and its effect on Dayton, are  much more credible as reasons to insist that the Croatian offensive stop  short of the city.  Holbrooke's attempts at concern for humanitarian  principles and his constant pats on the back for his colleagues often sound  over-done and smarmy.  He did a good job at Dayton, but he ain't gonna be  canonized.

The sack of the eastern Croatian town of  Vukovar in 1991 by Serb forces, and the subsequent mass murder of over 200  patients and staff from the local hospital is still a powerful and pivotal  event, not only because of the sheer magnitude of the atrocity, but also  because it was the first.  Vukovar came before the siege of Sarajevo, the  rape and torture camps in Prijedor and Foca and elsewhere, before the  destruction of Mostar bridge, and the massacre at Srebrenica.  Vukovar set  the standard for the atrocities that were to come, and eight years after  its destruction, the town is still a hollowed-out ruin with weeds poking  through shattered buildings and one-fourth of its prewar population  clinging precariously to subsistence in a destroyed economy. The siege and  fall of Bosnia's Srebrenica in 1995, engineered by indicted war criminal  Ratko Mladic has been amply documented elsewhere, but this book is not a  military history or the reconstruction of the crime.  Rather it is about  the search for the missing and the identification of bodies pulled from  mass graves.  The authors follow the forensic specialists, the  anthropologists and physicians who have created a sad but necessary  specialty in this field.  The exhumations are part of the search for the  truth, not only for the half-grieving, half-hopeful survivors who cling to  rumors about their loved ones, but for all people of compassion who hope  that finding some finality, and perhaps some justice, at the bottom of  these graves will serve both the living and the dead. The exhumations and  identifications are carried out according to strict forensic standards so  the results can be used as evidence at the Hague war crimes tribunal.  If  we are to forge any positive legacy from these atrocities, it may lie in  allowing the children of both the victims and the executioners to lead  normal lives, free from fear and revenge and poisonous hatred.  Memories  are long in this region, and vengeance can take decades.  The woman who  runs an orphanage for young Srebrenica survivors observes, \\"What is  important now is the message the international community sends to these  boys and what they then tell their own children.  If you say to a child,  `Look, that man there killed your father, and now he lives in your house.'  What kind of message is that going to send?  But if you say, `That man  killed your father and that is why he is in prison.'  The message is very  different.  So, for now, there might not be a lot of hatred or revenge, but  if we don't find a way to punish those responsible for these crimes, it  will surely be something we can count on in the future.\\"  To date, neither  Mladic nor the \\"Vukovar Three\\" are in the tribunal's custody.

In this collection he reveals his love  for stories.  There are stories about stories, stories told through  internal stories, stories about story-telling and stories about  story-tellers.  Here are recurring elements of Andric's work, a fine eye  for earthy detail, a profound understanding of life under the Ottomans, and  a reflexive rejection of generalization.<br />Ethnic tension ripples under  the surface of all the tales, most of which occur under Ottoman rule.  The  description of the uniquely powerful Bosnian hatred in The Story of the  Vizier's Elephant, &quot;the object becomes secondary, only its name  remains, and the hatred crystallizes, grows out of itself, according to its  own laws and needs...&quot; is a theme reinforced in A Letter from 1920,  &quot;Hatred which sets man against man and casts both alike into misery  and misfortune, or drives both opponents to the grave; hatred like a cancer  in an organism, consuming and eating up everything around it, only to die  itself at the last.&quot;  Bosnia was never a cultural melting-pot of  understanding and harmony; intolerance and fear have always been palpable  backdrops to everyday life.<br />Other striking images: the depiction of the  Vizier's evolving superstition in The Bridge on the Zepa, &quot;The  triumphant Vizier had come to know the fear of life.  So, unawares, he  entered the stage which is the first phase of dying, when a man comes to be  absorbed more in the shadows of things than in the things themselves&quot;.  The description of a craftsman in The Climbers: &quot;To be a craftsman is  to be able to separate the work one is doing at the time from everything  else, to know exactly and to hold before one's eyes one thing only: what  should be done and how...&quot;  And finally, the title novella The Damned  Yard, which refers to an Istanbul prison and the story-tellers incarcerated  there.  It is a curious narrative, reminiscent of &quot;1001 Arabian  Nights&quot; where every tale draws us seamlessly into the next until we  forget where we started.

The simple fact is that we don't know very much  about the Illyrians, especially in the pre-Christian periods.  The result  is that the first 180 pages of this chronological survey are extremely thin  on sociology, politics, organization, religion, etc... in short all of the  things we wish to learn from a history.  Instead, the text is an overly  detailed log of dig sites and types of implements found there, without any  broader analysis.  This is not Wilkes' fault, there simply hasn't been  enough scholarship, or enough breakthroughs in understanding the Illyrians  to satisfactorily fill these pages.<br />The book becomes much more useful,  and more interesting as we reach the Roman/Christian era, simply because  there is enough historical evidence to fill in a few more of the gaps.  Unfortunately, there still is not really enough grist.  Perhaps the next  tome on the Illyrians, in twenty years time, will reflect much more  fieldwork and understanding of their society.  Until then, this is a useful  jumping-off point, but hardly a comprehensive review of Illyrian  history.<br />For a nitpick:  the maps are a disaster.  The four maps in the  introduction simply do not carry enough information to the reader.  I found  myself frequently flipping to these maps, scouring them in vain for a place  name mentioned in the text, looking through a large atlas, wondering if the  name itself had changed over time, and ultimately being frustrated that I  couldn't locate events.  Author and editor should design dozens more maps,  relevant to nearby text, and sprinkle them liberally throughout the book.	1999-08-08

It is not a dry recitation of dates and historical facts, nor is it a complex analysis of causes and effects in the Ottoman empire.  Instead it is a brief and fascinating look  at certain specific scenes:  the fall of Constantinople, the harem, the  janissaries, Abdul Hamid &quot;The Red Sultan&quot;, the seige of Vienna.  Using these elements as jumping off points, Wheatcroft exposes western  myths about the Ottomans and with broad strokes traces the rise and fall of  the empire.  This book may not provide enough grist for committed scholars  but it is wonderfully readable, well-researched, and colorful.  It is an  excellent first or second book on the subject for those interested in a  vivid and balanced overview of the Ottoman empire.	1999-08-01

The scene is 1908, just before three successive wars sweep through the Balkans.  It is a time of palpable tension between the Habsburg and Ottoman empires, between Serb and Muslim  families on the ground.  It is a time of great change in Montenegro.  Auberon Harwell, a young British botanist stumbles into the mountains and  becomes a catalyst for events great and small.  He witnesses both the  unstable dance of dying empires and the clash of generations as Toma, the  Serb boy, is caught between his nationalist father and his mother who will  sacrifice anything to spirit her son away from an early Balkan death.  The  book's greatest achievement is its detailed eye for the terrain, the  people, and the atmosphere of Montenegro.  It is a wonderfully evocative  diary, a slice of Balkan life that rings true.	1999-06-20

Some accuse Kaplan of bias, but there is no consensus on just what he is biased for or against.  He may hate Turks, or Communists, or Serbs, or Greeks.  I suppose  if Kaplan has managed to offend all of the groups in the region, he has  probably done a good job of maintaining his integrity.  If he has an  agenda, it may be his human outrage against stubborn blindness and  barbarism.  He locates the Serbs and their sometimes primitive ways in the  mysticism and eastern aesthetic of the Orthodox church.  But he doesn't  fail to note that even a mayor of urbane Vienna can be a vicious  anti-Semite who provided inspiration to Hitler.<br />The portrait of Croatian  Archbishop Stepinac is nuanced and enlightening.  It may outrage both Croat  and Serb, but he identifies Stepinac's failing as an almost monstrous  combination of political naivet&eacute; and narrow-minded piety.  Stepinac was  perhaps a fool, and perhaps a coward.  His legacy is controversial because  the positions he took in life were confusing and contradictory.<br />Similarly, the bleak depictions of Albania, the eternal victim; of  Macedonia, the eternal battleground; and Bulgaria, whose strategic  decisions are distinguished for being uncommonly calamitous, offer deep and  bitter insights into the Balkan tragedy.  That this century is ending much  as it began in these countries is a cold condemnation of all parties.  In a  sense it is remote and irrelevant to criticize Kaplan for the lens he uses  to focus on these issues when the true problem is precisely the  short-sightedness that makes it too easy for people in the region to accuse  others of hatreds and bias without a shred of self-awareness.  It is these  people who perpetuate the disaster, not Kaplan and his book.<br />Kaplan is  an effectual writer; he summons the muse of Rebecca West to good effect.  His images, such as the introductory pre-dawn scene in the Kosovo monastery  and the conversation with Milovan Djilas, are deep and powerful.  In one  fascinating passage he follows a thread from the 1878 Congress of Berlin  all the way through World War I and beyond.  History is immediate and  accessible in the Balkans.

This  \\"outlook on life\\" as the nameless protagonist calls it, depicts the  individual struggling against the oppressive corruption of the folly of  urban society, which relentlessly grinds him until he succumbs.  The  protagonist in \\"On the Edge of Reason\\" is a fascinating study.  At a dinner  party he makes an unguardedly honest statement about an important  industrialist who years earlier had killed four burglars.  He soon finds  himself tried and jailed for slander.  We watch as he watches his life  spiral down into self-induced chaos that he defiantly chooses not to stop,  in the name of moral superiority.<br />In the hands of a lesser writer, the  story would be a two-dimensional struggle between a heroic and morally  attractive individual versus the insidious corrosion of society.  Krleza's  character is far more nuanced.  Convinced of the soundness of his own  views, he argues logic and moral righteousness, arguing most stridently  when his position is least logical.  As his monologue unfolds we more and  more doubt his sanity and the reliability of his judgment.  The protagonist  is not a nice fellow, he has ready excuses for every one of his own  reprehensible acts, including a fistfight in the Sistine Chapel, yet he  harshly condemns all of the \\"top-hatted men\\" who disagree with him.<br />The  oppressive and conspiratorial nature of the legal proceedings brings to  mind Kafka's \\"The Trial\\", except that Krleza's character is fully aware of  the runaway nature of events, yet he obstinately chooses to let his own  life fall to ruin.  The character recalls the nameless protagonist in  Dostoevsky's \\"Notes from Underground\\", except that Dostoevsky's man was  wickedly self-aware, as when he opens that book, \\"I am a sick man. I am a  spiteful man.  An unattractive man.  I think my liver hurts.\\"  Krleza's  character could never see himself in such an unflatteringly honest light.  He thinks himself well-liked and reasonable, so that when he learns others  despise him and his wife has had a lover for years, he is convinced that  this is just a sudden bout of hypocrisy by his neighbors, rather than  confronting the truth of his own lifelong disagreeableness.  He is  paranoid, delusional, self-important, and hypercritical of others.  And for  all that, he hits on some fundamental truths about the cynicism and the  dark heart of a civil society that jails him for slander while Domacinski  is lionized for multiple murders.<br />This is an excellent book.

In \\"Caf&eacute; Europa\\", the reader is carried from Croatia across western Europe during the few short years since  Croatia emerged from war as an independent state, caught somewhere between  its Balkan history and its European ambitions.  She ruminates on subjects  as far afield as her distaste for the word \\"we\\" because of its communist  overtones, which leads to the verdict that the western concept of \\"I\\", of  self-reliance and modernity in a civil state, is a notion still to be  embraced in eastern Europe.  It is for precisely the same reason that she  admires Americans their fetish for perfect teeth, because they represent  self-respect and independence from shoddy state-sponsored dental care.<br />Many of the essays in the book deal with the peculiar talent in eastern  Europe for hiding and forgetting the past, thereby evading responsibility  and missing the opportunity to learn from it.  This flair for forgetfulness  causes Drakulic's mother to fear for the sanctity of her husband's grave,  marked by a communist star vulnerable to those who would destroy symbols of  forty years of communism.  It is this same talent that allows fascist  \\"Ustasha\\" symbols from the 1940s to be revived in the 1990s under the guise  of nationalism.  The same phenomenon that impels each generation of  politicians to rename streets and plazas in order to avoid any public  recognition of historical figures whose views place them, at least  temporarily, on the wrong side of today's political fences.  It is this  same failure of history that forces a Croatian journalist to mince words  and ask facile questions during an exclusive interview with Dinko Sakic,  the notorious concentration camp commander.<br />Drakulic is a bit  exasperated when, on a visit to Israel, she is barraged with questions  about Croatia's fascist role during World War II.  \\"To grow up under  communism means to live forever in the present.  Once the final social  order had been established, there was no need to look backwards - or  forwards, for that matter.... Perhaps this is the reason why we are now, with  this recent war, sentenced to live in the past.  Sometimes I ask myself  whether this is the punishment for our lack of interest in history, for our  fear, silence and irresponsibility towards ourselves.  For our ingnorance.\\"  She realizes that Croatia as a society has failed to examine and integrate  the lessons of its fascist period, and this failure, this willful  forgetfulness, is itself a type of evil complicity perpetually spawning new  crises, including the high-tension ethnic conflicts that yielded the  1991-1995 wars.<br />The only jarring note is the essay titled \\"Why I Never  Visited Moscow\\", in which Drakulic bemoans the fact that she has been  categorized as an eastern European writer.  This seems a bit hypocritical  given that all of \\"Caf&eacute; Europa\\" including the very cover blurbs, much like  her previous books, is premised on the fact that she is a particularly  talented eastern European writer and astute social critic who has  interesting and insightful things to say about the region.

She kept appearing, day after day, to the same children for years.  She answered  questions, gave blessings and advice, and some say she healed the sick.  From the very beginning, the apparitions have aroused controversy within  and beyond the Catholic church.  While the town has become a major  attraction to pilgrims, and a series of scientists and experts have found  no reason to doubt the veracity or sanity of the children, others are not  so sure.<br />At the time of the visions, the church in Bosnia was undergoing  fundamental change as diocesan authorities sought to consolidate their  control over rural parishes traditionally operated by the Franciscans.  That the Virgin consistently supported the Franciscans and criticized  Bishop Zanic of Mostar to some people indicates the rightness of the  Franciscan position, but to others is a suspicious intervention in petty  church politics and undermines the credibility of the Meðugorje  apparitions.<br />Father O'Carroll, a member of the Pontifical Marian  Academy and the French Society for Marian Studies, quite obviously believes  in the Virgin apparitions.  The book is well organized to provide some  background to the political context and the personal disputes at play in  the controversy.  O'Carroll reprints Bishop Zanic's 24-page rebuttal to the  apparitions and gives full play to both sides.  However, he goes out of his  way to praise the scholarly and Christian attributes of those supporting  the apparitions, while being substantially less charitable to Zanic and  other skeptics.  Thus believer Ren&eacute; Laurentin has \\"established competence\\",  is \\"scrupulously honest, and \\"can be trusted in research and in loyalty to  the Church\\", while Bishop Zanic is \\"a tough Croatian\\", \\"strong-willed\\", and  \\"uninhibited to the point of recklessness\\".  The good Father O'Carroll  appears to take seriously his responsibility to make sure readers draw the  correct conclusions.<br />It is interesting to read as the ecclesiastical  and scientific experts marshal logic and empirical science to explain or  debunk the apparitions.  Ultimately, the book can help illuminate the  topic, but despite O'Carroll's best persuasive efforts, it can not decide  the issue conclusively one way or another.  That can only be done, one by  one, in the hearts of those interested in Meðugorje.e seriously his responsibility to make sure readers draw the  correct conclusions.  <br />It is interesting to read as the ecclesiastical  and scientific experts marshal logic and empirical science to explain or  debunk the apparitions.

The novel is a good one, winning prizes in  Yugoslavia when it was first published in 1988.  But it is not a great one.  It weaves together smartly the stories of sundry writers and critics, each  with idiosyncrasies and human foibles.  It ruminates on the contrasts  between westerners and eastern Europeans, a theme that provides grist for  both insightful humor and sad cynicism.<br />Ultimately, the book answers  Voltaire's question.  It is senseless, but it is amusing and has plenty of  clever scenes.  Pra explaining how he sprained his finger while giving a  silly artistic performance and had to go on half-pay and accept a larger  state-subsidized apartment; the Russian Troshin's scathing musings about  western visitors to eastern Europe, \\"What was the lure of Moscow?  A love  of fear?... How quickly they adapted to paranoia as a way of life.\\"; the  Croatian critic sizing up an American and concluding, \\"America's out.  Has  been for ages.... Europe is in!  Mitteleuropa!\\"; the Czech writer of a stolen  manuscript who struggles when the police ask him for a description of the  stolen goods, because he can't possibly give a good plot summary in a few  lines on a police report.<br />There are some fun plot twists at the end as  the role of the Flagus the pompous Frenchman is clarified. The British  sensibility of Michael Henry Heim's translation occasionally jars an  American reader, particularly when Marc, the prototypical American, speaks  with British usages.  Ugreic opens and closes the book with a series of  real-life journal entries, chronicling her back problems, her travels, and  her struggle with writer's block.  She is interesting, and she seems to  love writers and being a writer.

People who fled the wars in Bosnia and Croatia are scattered in Missouri and  Ontario, Germany and Austria, Israel and Pakistan, and they are displaced to other towns within their own countries.  They are not voluntary emigrants whose bags are packed with hopes in  search of a dream.  They may be wealthy, or at least they may once have  been.  The refugee cleaning floors for minimum wage may have been a surgeon  in her own life.  The eight-year old girl may be the only one in her family  who has learned English, so it is only she who can speak with government  officials and store clerks.  Refugees are anyone and everyone.  They are  professionals and farmers and little boys and criminals and poets, but  mostly they are women and children and the elderly.<br />The Suitcase gives  voice to the people &quot;without context&quot;.  They speak of their  dreams and their losses.  Their poems are here and sad scenes of small  things washed away forever by tides of war.  &quot;War taught us a lot.  How the fear makes people irrationally greedy.  It is difficult to resist  becoming greedy.  It is almost like an instinct.  To possess, to hold on to  something.  In shelters, to hold on to somebody.  To hold on to your  prayer, even if you never prayed before&quot;.  Some refugees long only for  the day when they can return to their hometowns to begin to reglue the  shards of their old lives.  Some can speak only of Bosnia's beauty or the  pleasures of a cup of coffee with friends.<br />Others close and lock the  door on the past with determination.  &quot;We arrived here safely.  Everyone is fine.  Please do not write us or try to contact us.  We do not  want to be reminded of anything&quot;, reads the postcard sent by a Bosnian  family after they arrived in Canada in 1994.<br />The book is well-edited and  well-organized along five broad themes.  These are followed by three  powerful afterwords, of which Dubravka Ugresic's is the strongest as she  muses on the fact that the people of the Balkans are one people.  Divided  by the same language, they look alike, and yet &quot;not one generation in  the Balkans manages to escape war, in every family there is at least one  killer and one killed, new life only begins on somebody else's dead  head.&quot;  There is one minor error  (p.11, Vukovar was attacked in 1991,  not 1992).<br />The Suitcase rings powerfully and true.

It is a communal society, purposely without women, a fact which allows property to  be shared and men to coexist harmoniously.  Into this world steps Jan  Smeeks, a boy kidnapped from Flanders, who embodies both male and female  characteristics.  Smeeks is astounded by the roving, plundering, male  &quot;pig&quot; characteristics of the Brethren, but he learns to despise  the sedentary, civilized, female &quot;cow&quot; characteristics of the  colonists and settlers.<br />Boullosa's characterization of Smeeks is  particularly sensitive.  His little-boy wonder when he touches his first  female breast, his comment that he always seems to notice the little  details of a situation while missing the larger picture (a trait which  makes him an interesting narrator), his fascination with Dr.Pineau's  existential pontifications, all mark him as something apart from the other  freebooters.<br />The book is a good one, it is interesting to think about  the ideal communal society predicated on the most appalling slaughter, on  the role played by the presence and absence of women - Eve in the Garden.  However, I wished the book were longer.  No characters beyond Smeeks are  fully drawn, and the abbreviated narrative leaves many gaps which the  reader is left to fill with imagination.  There are strong images:  the  Jamaican brothel, and the monks and nuns who refuse to be used as human  shields.  There are weak images:  the hurricane that kills dozens is not  described at all.  We just wake up the next day.  The translation is  occasionally jerky: &quot;L'Olonnais had the injured Spaniards who remained  on the path finished off after he asked them for what he wanted.&quot;  (p.164).

However he found he could not  do so without locating the seeds of the conflict in the 1940s, which are  rooted in the politics of the 1920s, which were engendered by the  nationalism of the 1840s, and so on.  What he ultimately produced is a  useful 300-page overview of Croatian history.  And he still managed to  write about the recent war, devoting 80 pages to events since 1990.<br />The  common view that Tanner is not sufficiently critical of unsavory elements  in Croatia's past is justified.  His discussion of the horrors of the World  War II-era Jasenovac concentration camp is cursory; he comments on the main  political football - the debate about the numbers and identities of the  victims - but fails to describe the political context surrounding the camp  or the lives of the people within it.  His praise for Tudjman as a noble,  if overzealous, nationalist who successfully steered his country to the  fruition of the `thousand-year-dream' is insufficiently honest about his  neo-fascist and sometimes nonsensical policies.  Today Tudjman's HDZ party  is a quasi-democratic regime rooted in corruption and repression.  The war  is over, the Croats won.  Now is the time for nurturing democratic  institutions.<br />From a journalist with such a tactile understanding of  the region, &quot;Croatia&quot; includes few of the primary source  interviews and observations that were so interesting and enlightening in  other recent books about the Balkans by British journalists (Misha Glenny,  Laura Silber).  Instead Tanner weaves together secondary sources and  analyses by other experts.  While this approach sacrifices visceral  understanding, it allows him to explain fluidly centuries of tangled  events.  This ultimately proves to be the work's strongest feature.<br />Tanner compresses dense material into smooth prose where each paragraph  fairly begs for its own chapter of elucidation.  Readers may not come away  with a deep feeling for what makes a Croat tick, but they will certainly  come away with a broad knowledge of the historical underpinnings of today's  twisted conflicts.  Tanner has something of a pro-Croat perspective, but  this is not disastrous.  Careful readers seeking understanding still rely  on multiple sources with varied viewpoints.  But for all the dilettantes  who throw up their hands and mutter about &quot;historical hatreds&quot;  and &quot;centuries of fighting&quot;, there is no longer any excuse for  ignorance.<br />A nitpick:  the book's maps are a failure.  The few maps are  haphazard and only loosely correspond to the events in the nearby text.  Many locations whose importance Tanner carefully explains appear nowhere on  the maps.  Perhaps a good editor can remedy this in the next edition.esses dense material into smooth prose where each paragraph  fairly begs for its own chapter of elucidation.

He wrote &quot;Conversations With  Stalin&quot; in 1961, between arrests.  The book is a diary of Djilas'  three voyages to Moscow in 1943, 44, and 48.  Djilas, his memories no doubt  leavened by hindsight, titles the three meetings &quot;Raptures&quot;,  &quot;Doubts&quot;, and &quot;Disappointments&quot;, and as these names  indicate, the book chronicles his growing disillusionment with Soviet-led  socialism.<br />Djilas was an educated man, a sophisticated thinker and a  writer.  So that when we read passages in the &quot;Raptures&quot; section  such as, &quot;My entire being quivered from the joyous anticipation of an  imminent encounter with the Soviet Union&quot;, it seems clear that he was  not the naïf that he makes himself out to be.  Rather, given his  circumstances at the time that he was writing, he was heightening the sense  of his early fascination with all things Soviet so that his later  disenchantment is all the more palpable.<br />The book fascinates with its  detail.  Djilas travels to Moscow as a foreign dignitary to discuss  Yugoslav-Soviet policies.  He must cool his heels for days before he is  finally summoned to meet Stalin, and then the meetings are typically all  night dinners with copious drinking and byzantine political subtext to the  conversation.  Stalin dominates the discussion so thoroughly that when he  insists that the Netherlands was not a member of the Benelux union, nobody  dares correct him.  Djilas recognizes traits of greatness in Stalin, his  ruthlessness and far-sightedness.  He describes these not out of regard or  respect, but because they are precisely the qualities which make Stalin  evil.  &quot;Every crime was possible to Stalin, for there was not one he  had not committed.&quot;<br />As doubts begin to creep in for Djilas, he  records the development of his own cynicism.  &quot;In politics, more than  in anything else, the beginning of everything lies in moral indignation and  in doubt of the good intentions of others&quot;.  His portraits of  Krushchev, open-minded and clever; of Molotov, Stalin's taciturn  lieutenant; Dimitrov, the powerful Bulgarian kept on Stalin's string;  Beria, sinister and drunk; and a host of other prominent figures make this  book required reading for those interested in the era.  The descriptions of  machinations surrounding Yugoslav-Albanian-Bulgarian politics and his  unflattering characterization of Croatian hero Andrija Hebrang are of great  interest to students of Balkan history.the development of his own cynicism.  &quot;In politics, more than  in anything else, the beginning of everything lies in moral indignation and  in doubt of the good intentions of others&quot;.

Their detailed accounts of UN policy debates and genocidal Serb attacks on the  civilian population leading to the expulsion of over 20,000 women and  children and the murder of 6,000 Bosnian Muslim men clearly demonstrate the  failure of the international community's tepid approach to peace-keeping  and the responsibility of the military and political leaders involved.  There were no heroes at Srebrenica, only variable levels of guilt.  The  book is dispassionate and slightly distanced from the moral implications of  the massacre.  It is indeed a `record of a war crime'.<br />The Bosnian Serbs,  commanded by General Ratko Mladic and led politically by Radovan Karadzic  (both indicted for war crimes by the Hague tribunal), carefully planned for  weeks and months the reduction of the Srebrenica enclave.  They had  calculated the number of buses needed to transport the Muslim men to their  killing fields, and they ordered the victims to remove their shoes before  being shot in order to thwart identification.<br />The book is divided into  three sections, describing the actual fall of Srebrenica; the slow slide of  the international community into the &quot;safe area&quot; concept as a  sort of least common denominator; and the months of military and political  deterioration leading up to the massacre.  There is criticism for everyone:  the UN which viewed the safe areas as an interim solution and came to  endorse them because Security Council members were unwilling and unable to  agree on anything more substantive.  For their defense, the Bosnians in  Srebrenica relied on the goodwill and the hesitation of their enemy Serbs  and on an undersupplied battalion of Dutch soldiers.  The US which  abandoned the Vance-Owen peace plan without a viable alternative and then  endorsed the creation of &quot;safe areas&quot; without the will to defend  them.  The authors also point out that policy disputes in Washington  prevented the pursuit of a &quot;Frasure Deal&quot;, a negotiating track  between US Ambassador Robert Frasure and Serb President Slobodan Milosevic.  The Bosnian Muslim leadership which refused to evacuate its civilians from  Srebrenica long after it recognized the enclave as indefensible.  The Dutch  government which ostentatiously placed its troops in harm's way in order to  satisfy domestic humanitarian demands, but then allowed them to become  little more than underfed hostages unable to defend themselves, much less a  large civilian population.<br />But most of all, final and criminal  culpability falls to Mladic and Karadzic and the Bosnian Serbs with murder  in their hearts who achieved military conquest through genocide.  For while  the authors demonstrate that any number of international players may have  been able to stop the massacre of Srebrenica, only one side actually  started it, the Serbs.<br />The book is excellently researched and clearly  organized.  By allowing the facts to speak for themselves and eschewing  vociferous moral censures, Honig and Both have indicted us all for our  roles in the worst European massacre since World War Two.defend  them.

When it was written in 1993 the conflict still raged and disclosures of systematic government-ordered rapes primarily against Muslim  women by Serbs were new and shocking to most readers.  Now five years later  the crimes still shock, but by their magnitude and not their novelty.  This  book is still a powerful witness to the rapes, but more importantly it  provides a legal, psychological, and historic framework for coming to an  understanding which is necessary if we are to try to prevent more such  horrors in the future, or at least to provide a timely intervention and  vigorous prosecution of the perpetrators.<br />Stiglmayer's own pair of  essays are the most useful and interesting.  Her first piece is an  absorbing history of the Balkans that concisely untangles the web of  hatreds and violence which have plagued the area for millennia and which  are still powerfully germane.  Her second piece constitutes the heart of  the book.  In it she dramatically and persuasively demonstrates that the  rapes in Bosnia are not &quot;typical&quot; rapes, even by wartime  standards, but are a tool systematically employed by the Serb leadership to  pursue its genocidal campaign of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;.  Her  interviews illustrate that the rapes are about the humiliation of women,  but they are also directed at the Bosnian Muslim population as a whole as a  tactical means to accomplish the evacuation by the Muslims of large swaths  of Bosnian territory.<br />In other essays, Paul Parin offers some ideas on  the psychology of the rapes.  He doesn't claim to have all the answers, but  his essay is thought-provoking.  Rhonda Copelon provides a considered  analysis of the state of international law and its applicability to the  Bosnian horrors.  Her otherwise sound piece is marred by her  lawyerly/academic tendency to misuse words (&quot;surface&quot; as a  transitive verb meaning &quot;bring to light&quot;;  &quot;intersectional&quot; where she means &quot;intersecting&quot;) and  her occasional unlawyerly hyperbole (she notes on p.198 that a midday  women's talk show opened with the script, &quot;In Bosnia, they are raping  the enemy's women&quot;.  Two pages later this has turned into the  assertion that the media &quot;often refer to the mass rape in Bosnia as  the rape of the `enemy's women'&quot;).<br />Surprisingly, the most  disappointing essays are those by the best-known authors.  The first of  Catharine MacKinnon's two pieces is a reprint of a 1993 Ms. Magazine  article.  She gets in some obligatory feminist chops, pokes at Gloria  Steinem, equates the Third Reich with Penthouse, and moans about American  women in porn films, in brothels, and in slavery.  She slips in a couple of  gratuitous anecdotes, and that's it.  No analysis, no nothing.  It reads as  though she wrote it on a train with a short deadline and did her research  by cell-phone.  Her second piece is marginally better, but her point is a  weak one.  She is horrified by the crimes against women, yet she wants to  pile every insult and irritation ever suffered by woman under the umbrella  of human rights violation.  In one breathless sentence (p.185) she says  &quot;...UN troops were targeting women: `In the streets of Zagreb, UN  troops often ask local women how much they cost'&quot;.  Her whining about  merely boorish behavior undermines her credibility and belittles the plight  of women who suffered grievously in the wars.  MacKinnon is exasperating,  yet passionate, but ultimately her pieces fail because of her unsupported  allegations and the scattered and distracting nature of her attacks on  anything that pops into her head.<br />Similarly, Susan Brownmiller spends her  essay slamming men as warrior animals.  So much so that she entirely misses  the point that these rapists were not beasts out of control, but were  entirely under control and following their leaders' war plans to a tee.  Brownmiller is not a scholar of Balkan history with any depth or  understanding.  She doesn't have Stiglmayer's innovative perceptions of the  war.  The Brownmiller piece offers no value added, it is mere  filler.<br />Overall the book is excellent.  Although, now, five years later,  Stiglmayer could well give it another update, in addition to the changes  she has made for this English edition.  The wars have reached a precarious  end, the ICTY war crimes trials are underway.

It would be better subtitled:  &quot;How I Feel about Rape, Women, and my Own Interesting Self&quot;.  It  is a silly narcissistic, self-referential volume.  It is a pathetic excuse  for academic scholarship, where feelings substitute for research, where  emotions are facts, and where accusations constitute reality.  To call  Allen a lazy researcher would not be accurate, she appears to possess  abundant energy but doesn't appear inclined to expend any of it in the  pursuit of accuracy or substance.  She does seem to organize a number of  conferences and then shares their details with us, including one  particularly ghastly Alpine fantasy in Slovenia.  The book is so absurd  that I finished it only as one might watch a slow-motion train wreck -  appalled at myself for continuing to turn the pages, yet unable to tear  myself away from its awfulness.  To quote the Critic:  this book fills a  much-needed gap on the bookshelf.<br />The faults in this book would  constitute a book in themselves.  Here is an abbreviated list, in no  particular order:<br />Allen spends the FIRST FORTY PAGES of the book  discussing how she feels about this topic, and how she plans to approach  it.  It is not until the third chapter (she indulges in the conceit of  calling her chapters `themes' to account for their lack of continuity) that  she finally begins a discussion of the substantive issue at hand.<br />At  least she lets us know in the introduction that the book will be tough  sledding, when she states that the atrocities in Bosnia are a cognitive  problem for her, i.e., she can't believe it because it's so bad.  This  perspective of the author's feelings and how the war makes her feel is the  dominant theme of the book.  To say that Allen gets in the way of the book  would be inaccurate, since she IS the book.<br />Allen blithely confesses to  her lack of concern for factual accuracy, as in the endnote where she  admits that a UN investigator has been unable to confirm the existence of  pornographic videotapes of Bosnian rapes.  Undeterred, Allen notes  &quot;whether they exist in fact or simply as rumor, even the rumor of such  tapes is a chilling aspect of this genocide&quot;.<br />In another endnote,  she bemoans her inability to find a suitable definition of the word  &quot;ethnicity&quot; because she chooses to define it in cultural rather  than genetic terms.  At the same time, she falls in love with the word  &quot;toposcape&quot; which she has invented, using variations of it five  times before you finish the first chapter.  &quot;Toposcape&quot; doesn't  appear in any of my standard dictionaries, but Allen doesn't offer us a  definition.  It appears to mean alternately `region' or `demographics', or  something.<br />She makes obvious factual errors, on page 15 mistaking the  city of Vukovar for the region of Voyvodina, and on page 105 confusing  Panama for Nicaragua.  She has a shallow understanding of Balkan history,  her full and complete explanation for the recent wars is contained in a few  lines which read, &quot;Decades of dictatorship created sectors of  privilege and oppression that are now being renegotiated by means of war  and genocide&quot;.  This is simply sloppy scholarship.  However she needs  to be brief in explaining the conflict, because the more space she devotes  to politics and history, the less she is able to talk about herself.<br />In  the chapter entitled &quot;Identity&quot;, she feels compelled to offer us  four pages of background about her Swedish roots, Oakland, and her trip to  Sweden.  She follows this with a quick paragraph about &quot;M&quot;, her  Croatian-American interlocutor.  It's not difficult to discern the relative  importance of characters in this book.<br />The chapter entitled  &quot;Analysis&quot; is little more than an inter-feminist catfight.  She  spends six pages attacking a1975 work by Susan Brownmiller, and then  another five slamming Croatian feminist Slavenka Drakulic in surprisingly  personal terms, referring to her in a note as a &quot;rank  opportunist&quot;.  It's all pretty unseemly, this material would have been  better sent in a personal letter to Drakulic.<br />This is only a partial list  of this book's dozens of shortcomings, both of substance and style. Feel  free to compile your own list.  Allen's explanations are often internally  contradictory, and her thesis seems to change from chapter to chapter.  In  short, this book is junk, self-absorbed nonsense.  It has nothing to  recommend it, although the cover art is sort of catchy.  If you don't read  any other books about the Balkans this year, don't read this one either.1975 work by Susan Brownmiller, and then  another five slamming Croatian feminist Slavenka Drakulic in surprisingly  personal terms, referring to her in a note as a &quot;rank  opportunist&quot;.

Readers looking for insight into the labyrinth of Balkan  history will find here a useful starting point.  At heart, this is a book  about civilization and its changes.  It pivots upon the contrast between  the small parochial existence of the quiet Bosnian town where the bridge is  the central and everlasting feature versus the wider world of Balkan  politics where Ottoman Turkey, Orthodox Serbia, and Catholic  Austria-Hungary wage a centuries-long battle for political domination.<br />The book chronicles the bridge and the town for over three centuries.  It is filled with memorable characters, soldiers, lovers, saloon-keepers,  priests, and town leaders.  There is the 19th-century schoolmaster who  embodies the parochial village so perfectly.  He is better-educated than  most of the townspeople, but only slightly.  This reputed wisdom gives him  the arrogance to act as the town historian, a duty he fulfills by keeping a  small notebook in which he fails to record historical events.  Even the  seminal affairs of 1878, when the region was transferred from the Ottomans  to the Habsburgs, merits only a few lines in his notebook because he judges  that these events are simply not terribly important.  And that captures the  essence of the book: events in the wider world are deemed unimportant in  the village until they come, like the flood in the early pages, in a  torrent of change and surprise.<br />Thus does the town evolve, isolated from,  yet thoroughly buffeted by, the great historical affairs of the centuries.  In the end Pavle the merchant finds that this myopic approach has led him  to ruin.  Alihodja, whose unique ability to articulate the impact of world  politics on the lives of the town's provincials earns him an injured ear  and a reputation as an eccentric, never quite realizes how closely his  vision entwines his fate with that of the bridge itself.<br />The standard  interpretation holds that the bridge is the symbol for the Ottoman Empire,  resolute and everlasting, welcoming yet exotic, and built to standards far  higher than any to which this little town can aspire.  In the original  title Andric uses the word for a Turkish bridge (cuprija) and not the  standard Serbo-Croatian word for bridge (most).  Yet at the same time, the  bridge resists this symbolism.  It is not a bridge from the past to the  future, or from the village to the wider world, or between Christian Europe  and Muslim Turkey.  It is simply a sturdy stone bridge.  While the  uncomplicated lives of the townsfolk dip and yaw in full color, and while  the ponderous events of the outside world roll on in inscrutable ways, the  bridge remains unchanged.  The true symbols in the book are the rich and  detailed characters who live and die by the Drina river.  Each has  something to tell us, and none is superfluous.  These characters describe  for us the consequences of conflict and cooperation in a comfortable little  town caught in uncomprehending suffering by its location along one of  history's great fault lines.

This is a pretty good book.  It is an  interesting book, but not an important book.  Slavenka Drakulic, itinerant  Croatian writer, gives us communism on the ground.  There are no  ideological struggles here, no discussions of the finer points of Marxist  theology.  Instead Drakulic demonstrates clearly that communism is empty,  that it failed its citizens, its leaders, and itself.  Forty-five years of  communist leadership in Yugoslavia failed to produce livable apartments,  affordable telephones, sanitary products for women, dolls for children.  In  short, communism failed because all along it was a massive shell game where  the party members were haves and everyone else were have-nots.  It failed  because it generated fear instead of happiness.<br />Worse, communism  continues.  We in the West like to use 1990 as a pushpin year for  &quot;the end of communism&quot;, but Drakulic demonstrates that communism  thrives, if not in the government ministries of eastern Europe, then in the  hearts and minds and habits and fears of its inhabitants.  The funereal  atmosphere in Zagreb as Croatia held its first democratic elections in  decades, the compulsive hoarding by a populace made wary by the  unreliability of supplies of staples and everyday products, the resignation  to lives no better than those of parents and grandparents.  These  sensibilities endure in eastern Europe, and they probably will go on for  decades until a younger generation with no memory of communist economic  planning and political oversight steps to the fore.  &quot;The end of  communism is still remote because communism, more than a political ideology  or a method of government, is a state of mind.&quot;<br />Finally, Drakulic  shows us that the &quot;trivial is political&quot;.  That communism has  successfully achieved it aim of raising the political consciousness of the  masses, for when trivial acts such as buying toilet paper and making a  phone call are made contingent on political decisions by faceless, scary  bureaucrats in forbidding buildings, then every act and every person  becomes politicized.  Politicized in silent yielding opposition to  authority, but not politicized to challenge the legitimacy of such an  illegitimate regime.<br />Drakulic's essays are touching and humorous.  They  are as sad as the story of half the women in Poland suddenly sprouting red  hair, because red was the only color of hair dye available.  These essays  bring us nose-to-nose with the unfortunates forced to endure in a political  system whose strong point was always in theory and whose weak points were  generation after generation of misery for millions of people in dozens of  countries.ntingent on political decisions by faceless, scary  bureaucrats in forbidding buildings, then every act and every person  becomes politicized.

Greedy, corrupt leaders vaulted to the fore by  tapping into a subconscious vein of popular nationalism.  They were  followed over the edge by unthinking adherents characterized by a uniquely  Balkan combination of ruthlessness, self-righteousness, and utter  inhumanity.  It is good to ride with  Glenny as he travels through a  country in the process of explosive suicide if only to remind ourselves  that even in Europe civilization is but a thin facade masking deep hatreds  and combustive violence.<br />Glenny's central thesis, that Serb hegemony over  Croats in a united Yugoslavia and Croat hegemony over Serbs in an  independent Croatia will always lead to tensions is incontrovertible.  His  corollary, that wicked self-serving leaders are able to exploit these  tensions and turn them to violence in the absence of a reasoned political  debate and vigorous interest by the international communtiy, is an  indictment of the Slavs' chronic inability to compromise.<br />Could  Yugoslavia have split up peacefully?  Probably, but not after popular  elections gave power to leaders such as Tudjman and Milosevic.  It is a  fantastical jump to posit that Yugoslavs could have engaged in a peaceful  separation on the Czech/Slovak model, because the first criterion for such  a process is enlightened leadership in Zagreb and Belgrade.  This does not  exist.  There was nothing inevitable about the Third Balkan War, we all saw  it coming like a train wreck and it happened all the same.  Glenny's  first-hand account written in an engaging prose that combines journalism  and historical analysis is an excellent guide to these tragic events.tten in an engaging prose that combines journalism  and historical analysis is an excellent guide to these tragic events.	1998-10-04

Pavlowitch's 110-page overview gives an excellent account of Tito's early  life, the development of his political acumen in the crucible of Comintern  machinations in the 1920s and 30s, his slavish devotion to Stalinist  ideals, and his stubborn adherence to his own closely-held vision for  Yugoslavia.  This vision was the integrating theme that maintained Yugoslav  unity during his long rule, but it also contained the seeds of its own ruin  in that Tito's inability to respond effectively to economic crises  beginning in the mid-1960s and the subsequent societal disaffection with  the Communist program gave sustenance to the nationalist fever which  exploded in Croatia and Bosnia in 1992 and Kosovo in 1998.<br />Had Tito been  a truly effective unifier, he would have done more than postpone the day of  nationalist reckoning until ten years after his death, he would have  addressed the fundamental forces underpinning nationalist yearnings.<br />This  book provides an excellent look at Tito and his contributions to  Yugoslavia.  Pavlowitch is especially strong in his analysis of Communist  party politics and Tito's schizophrenic relations with the Soviet Union.  I  only wish the author had provided a more detailed explanation of Tito's  economic planning.  The &quot;self-management&quot; economy receives only a  dozen words of attention.  It is difficult to fault Pavlowitch on this  point after he heroically struggled to compress a mass of dense material  into this fine short volume, but a cursory understanding of Yugoslav  economic dynamics would be invaluable to a reader who might not buy another  volume about the country.  Surely a few paragraphs on economics would not  stretch the book unreasonably.<br />On the nitpicking side, the book seems to  have both British and American editors, as financial figures are given  alternately in the British &quot;$3,400 million&quot; (p.77) and the  American &quot;$20-21 billion&quot; (p.91).  Also he sometimes assumes the  reader has significant pre-knowledge, as when he introduces Tito's three  senior lieutenants by last name only, &quot;In the spring of 1938... he set  up a provisional leadership around Djilas, Kardelj and Rankovic&quot;  (p.23) without providing further background on these individuals.  I can  only assume the relevant background material was left on the editing-room  floor.  However, these are quibbles, the book is excellent.der has significant pre-knowledge, as when he introduces Tito's three  senior lieutenants by last name only, &quot;In the spring of 1938... he set  up a provisional leadership around Djilas, Kardelj and Rankovic&quot;  (p.23) without providing further background on these individuals.
