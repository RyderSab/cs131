US	52765756	R14K63A9V5OVCR	0312342985	376889311	Never Call Retreat: Lee and Grant: The Final Victory	Books	5	12	15	N	Y	Great finish.	The final installment of the trilogy does not disappoint. The first volume began with the fictionalized second day of Gettysburg, which had Lee accepting Longstreet's advice to flank the Union positions rather than to attack Cemetery Hill again. That was in fact Longstreet's advice and hindsight tells us he was absolutely correct.  <br />That decision would have put Lee's army in a commanding position in the north. The second volume then deals with how that advantage might have been parlayed into battlefield victories. It also brings to the fore General Grant and develops his role as a leader in a manner not too inconsistent with the facts.  <br /> <br />In the third and final volume the authors continue to weave their alternate history of the Civil War in a manner that does not distort the true character of any of the men involved, only the events. The question to be settled then was whether a Confederate army operating in the north could sustain itself in the way Grant and then Sherman were able to sustain their westerners in the deep south during that same period. It is a wonderfully complex premise and the authors do a masterful job of developing it.  <br />All told, the trilogy is an enjoyable journey of \\"what ifs\\" that while fictional nonetheless serves up a lot of faithful history and leaves the reader satisfied with the blend.  <br />	2005-07-11

I generally stay away from historical fiction, but Vidal is pretty straight about telling the reader beforehand what is invented and what is fact. <br />Burr is a pivotal figure in American history but unfortunately he is one whose role is rarely understood beyond the incident with Hamilton and the accusation of his planned western uprising. He was a man who lead a fascinating life, a life of his own choosing. As a result of this, he never \\"fit\\" into any group (or political party) and was thus easy prey for political and legal rivals of any stripe.  <br />He was fond of very few men (but of very many women) and counted such polar opposites as Jefferson and Hamilton among his enemies. Nonetheless, he was able to work with both of them whenever the need arose. <br />Vidal's book illuminates Burr in a generally positive light and as a result many of our usual heroes become rather more like villains. Personally, I found the character quite believable and actually quite sympathetic. The book is, like all Gore Vidal's work, well written and devoid of pretentiousness. This one I think is his second best work, \\"Lincoln\\" being my personal favorite.	2005-07-03

I enjoyed this second book in what promises to be a series of fictionalizations of the Civil War from Messrs Gingrich and Forstchen. As with the first, the writing is fairly crisp and the flow very nice, making the book an easy and enjoyable weekend read.<br />The first volume, Gettysburg, left us with Lee giving in and allowing Longstreet to attempt an outflanking maneuver of the Union supply base southeast of Gettysburg rather than charging up Cemetery Ridge again. The outcome for the Confederates was, as well it might have been, rather better in the former scenario.<br />This volume picks up after the Gettysburg (&amp; Union Mills) debacle and has Mr Lincoln calling for the hero of Vicksburg to take control of all Union armies in the field, especially of what then remained of the famed, fabled and oft-misused Army of the Potomac.<br />It may be fiction, but of course we know so much about Grant as a soldier and commander that it really takes very little in the way of imagination to simply have painted him into the picture at this critical (fictional) juncture. How he responds is of course the stuff of the book, the contents of which I won't divulge here, save to say the ending leaves little doubt as to the issuance of a third volume, which (in my opinion) might just see what chess players term &quot;exchanging&quot;.	2004-07-18

Doris Kearns Goodwin's book &quot;No Ordinary Time&quot; about FDR &amp; Eleanor is a fine piece of writing that certainly belongs in anyone's American History library. Of course it is World History, but it is written from a very American perspective and thereby  manages to relegate even Churchill to the wings. <br />There is a degree of nearly strident feminism in the writing, not quite what one would call shrill, but the author's sympathies seem to lean decidedly toward Mrs. Roosevelt, often based on issues of sexual inequality. To be fair, Ms. Kearns Goodwin is about as harsh in her handling of racial prejudice<BR>and anti-semitism, both cases where FDR used Eleanor as a lightening rod. <br />What emerges is nonetheless what most sources reveal: he was the instinctive politician who happened to be in the right place at the right time to make magic happen while she was a tireless social activist more in tune with the masses than with any one person. He could bend his principles when needed (either for the greater good of the whole or on occasion for his own selfish indulgences) whereas she was quite rigid and nearly incapable of intimacy.<br />One can (or should) hardly judge them. It is enough to appreciate their complexity and their contrasts and to see how they played off one another so well. The real beauty of this book is that it allows us to do just that quite completely.	2004-06-28

The book is a beautiful blend of a dual biography and of world history in the first half of the last century. Naturally, the protagonists are Roosevelt & Churchill, and the backdrop is World War II.  The author leads up to the outbreak of the conflict with just the right amount of background on both men, as well as with a bit of the politics of the era. Interestingly, (and actually a point that was lost on the President but not on the Prime Minister), they had briefly met as underlings during the Great War. No fast friendship was to be theirs however.  Politics and circumstance drew them together twenty years hence, and while they initially approached one another with caution and with great reserve, they were to become not only allies but truly brothers-in-arms. Their meetings were warm and their friendship made the alliance more efficient than any other of its day.  This is not to say there weren't differences; there were indeed many important ones and they not infrequently led to serious strains on their friendship. Among such issues detailed nicely in this book were Churchill's hard-line dedication to the British empire (and all the strategic & political implications of keeping the Empire intact) and Roosevelt's reflexive, inner politician, a personality that could be cold, hurtful and quite disingenuous.   In the end, it certainly seems that Churchill was not only the more forthright of the two, but also the more prescient. He perceived Stalin's intentions and the coming Cold War perhaps before anyone else. His warnings however made little impression on Roosevelt or on anyone else in a position to make a difference. Unlike his ally, however, Churchill would survive long enough to see the Cold War he had predicted become our reality, to see the Russians turned back from Cuba, and to receive an honorary American citizenship from President Kennedy. Knowing Churchill just a bit leaves one with the feeling that this last honor was one he most sincerely cherished.	2004-02-14

The author is the son of a flag-raiser on Iwo Jima who returns to the scene of his medic father's enshrinement in photographic immortality to seek \\"the truth\\".   What he discovers is that the Japanese were cannibals, eating the livers and other bodily parts of their captured POWs. However, he is able to forgive this as a part of the \\"fog of war\\", citing the U.S. firebombing of Japanese cities as equally barbaric. The author even makes  friends with an Imperial Japanese Army veteran who beheaded a downed American flyer. This fellow, a Mr. Watanabe, was an American citizen (!) who returned to Japan just prior to the outbreak of the war and served as an interpreter and signal corps member of the IJA.   The author's (and Watanabe's) big break comes when former President G. H. W. Bush, peripherally featured in the book, learns of the author's effort to discover the fate of the lost flyers. The former president decided to visit him on Chichi Jima to see if he could put his own ghosts to rest (Mr. Bush it seems suffers 'survivor's guilt' over his narrow escape off Chichi Jima after his Avenger was shot down).    Anyway, the President meets Watanabe near the spot where the latter was standing when he watched Mr. Bush crash and then get rescued by a U.S. submarine standing by for just such a mission. Watanabe tells the President that the Japanese soldier standing next to him at that moment had commented that the \\"Americans must care a great deal about their pilots to use a submarine to rescue them\\". Yes indeed!   Mr. Bush may of course forgive his former enemies, but it would seem foolish for anyone to forget the lesson: The Japanese sowed the whirlwind; we were not responsible for the harvest they reaped.	2004-01-04

I am generally afraid that sources of information are forgotten, but that the information may be retained and taken for fact.<br />Now, assuming you're not going to fall into that trap, this is a piece of great historical fiction. Whether it was Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Forstchen who actually put pen to paper I do not know, but the writing is wonderful and flows beautifully.<br />The history is basically accurate through day 1 at Gettysburg, when Confederate forces made the error of attacking fixed and fortified Union positions on the high ground around the town.<br />This was almost the mirror image of the error Burnside had made previously at Fredericksburg. No doubt the rules of how to wage war were fast changing. What these professionally trained leaders on both sides (almost all West Pointers) had learned from their texts and from the Mexican War 20 years earlier needed to be updated by the recent changes introduced by the rifle and by the trench, not to mention by the improvements in artillery. (the same lessons were still taught for decades after the Civil War and explain in part the horrific losses in WWI caused by the storming of trenches whose occupants were now armed with machine guns)<br />It is on the fateful second day the book largely departs from the history. It has Longstreet convincing Lee of the wisdom of not attacking uphill again, but instead of making a great flanking march behind the Union left and into their base of supplies, inserting themselves in the process between the Army of the Potomac and Washington. The outcome, while fictional, seems in fact quite plausible. Would newly appointed commander Meade have reacted quickly enough to counter such a move, especially in the presence of a feint from Confederate cavalry General Stuart coming from the opposite quarter of the battlefield? The answer is unknown, but it is certainly an intriguing proposition.<br />I am absolutely certain that anyone who enjoys the study of our second national immersion into a great crucible of fire will find this bit of fiction irresistible.

I enjoyed the writing style of the author but his inability to separate the historical facts from his own conjecture is annoying at times.  That he has a rather flawed protagonist is obvious from the start, and to Mr. Thomas's credit, he does not try to do the impossible with JPJ's character.  I was interested in the subject and in the period and was lead to read C.S. Forester's \\"Lord Nelson\\" immediately afterwards.   Call me an Anglophile if you must, but I'm afraid that aside from some pettiness and their shared awkwardness with women, they had little in common. Nelson was a consistently good leader of men and a great naval tactician on a large scale, whereas Jones seems to have been at least as lucky as he was good and never really commanded much beyond his own ship.  That notwithstanding, this is a good read and a worthwhile investment of a weekend.	2003-12-08

I also give Mr. Vincent credit for almost never passing moral judgment on an individual whose morals were certainly flawed (oh poor Fanny!).<BR>In any case, it's entertaining and informative and flows quite well. Nelson is so \\"human\\", so many foibles, but he truly deserves the sobriquet \\"Father of Modern Royal Navy\\". <BR>Large scale tactical planning as well as \\"modern\\" command and control structure were instinctive to him.

This is the best war diary I have read, and for many reasons. Elisha Rhodes has an excellent, straightforward writing style with very good grammatical structure. This makes the diary easy to follow. He was involved in virtually the entire war fought by the Army of the Potomac, and so it is pretty much a complete history in that sense. <BR>At the same time, this private who ultimately became a colonel (in his early 20s!) remains about as unaffected as a man could be. Nothing good or bad really changes his simple and honest view of the war's ultimate justice, and many times he refers to the sacrifices as being easily justified by the gain of saving the union and of freeing the slaves.<BR>He is religious but not judgmental, and never does he develop any real hatred of the enemy. He does his duty with a minimum of fuss. He enjoys his army life, but is quite happy to return to civilian life at the end.<BR>Maybe most interesting to me was his innocent myopia. He never really knew the &quot;big picture&quot; of how the overall war was being fought, or even what the importance of many of the battles he was involved in might have been. He was content to leave that to the generals, and especially to Grant, in whom he had a great deal of trust. <BR>This is a great weekend read for any civil war buff.	2003-09-13

I admit I spent nearly 3 months reading this trilogy, but at least it was three months well spent. I first became aware of the author while watching Ken Burns' excellent PBS series, during which time it seemed to me that he was used as an advocate for the southern cause. Being a Yankee in the Deep South myself, I find myself drawn to both &quot;sides&quot; and to neither, alternatively.<BR>I had just finished Bruce Catton's most excellent Army of the Potomac trilogy, and feeling I had allowed that Michiganer to infuse me with his views, it seemed only fair to expose myself to Mr. Foote's as well.<BR>Neither author is anything but American, and as a result, both books tell the story with compassion for all the men who fought the battles that lingered on for four incredible years. In fact, both seem vaguely sympathetic to the south, but that too seems to be an American trait, that tendency to side with the underdog. Nonetheless, he is balanced and fair in his approach to all of the principle players on both sides.<BR>Mr. Foote's research is excellent and his fund of knowledge is simply breathtaking (I realize he wrote from his notes). While his literary style is a half step behind that of Mr. Catton, his scholarship is not. I think no one would read this without having more than a casual interest in the conflict, and of these people, none will be disappointed with the work.	2003-08-03

This is a nicely told narrative of the journey of Lewis &amp; Clark, including both the preparations prior to their departure and their lives after they returned from the Pacific.

Bruce Catton is, in my opinion, the most readable author of American Civil War history. Whenever I've labored through some book I wanted to read but have struggled with, I reward myself with something he has written. <BR>This trilogy is, as all his work is, thoroughly researched and very balanced. It would be hard to detect any bias in this native Michiganer of the first half of the 20th century, though I vaguely suspect he had more sympathy for the South, if only for the \\"pluck\\" (he likes that word in fact) of their \\"David vs. Goliath\\" undertaking. <BR>This 2nd volume is perhaps the best. It describes what is in some ways is the most tragic period of the war, that period too long after Bull Run for the Confederates to still believe the North wouldn't or couldn't fight, and too long before Appomattox to allow the Northerners to see that they would prevail. It is particularly sad to think of the brave men who fought for the Union and died senselessly because they were lead by Generals of so little military talent (Pope, Burnside and even Hooker). <BR>The book does a wonderful job in detailing the battle of Gettysburg and it is clear that this is a favorite topic of the author. While Catton does not give much credit for the battle to Meade, he does point out that Meade at least stabilized the Army from the time he took over until Grant would come along (read Volume 3!). <BR>In any case, the real beauty of any of Catton's works is his insight not so much into the Generals and the politicians, but into the common soldier of both sides; what made them fight so savagely one moment, but embrace one another so fully the next? (Of particular fascination to me, and Catton brings this up frequently, is the unending custom of the pickets on both sides of a stable front to make informal [and unauthorized] truces and then to trade jibes, coffee, tobacco, newspapers, & even vital information with their enemy; these men did their duty when called upon to do so, but there was littleif any ingrained, knee-jerk hatred of the enemy in this war) <BR>The answer lies in the strange brotherhood that developed between the men of the Army of Northern Virginia and those of the Army of the Potomac. These men, after many years of hardship and privation and death, were a bit more likely to see their generals as the cause of their suffering and a lot more likely to see the tens and hundreds of thousands on both sides who stayed home while they fought as the real enemy. In this common bond of men doing their duty and doing it admirably lay the seed which made reunification at least palatable in the minds of so many men from so many distant places.	2003-02-08

It worked great for me, and while the &quot;mini-Robbins&quot; was loved by many, I never really used mine, finding the above system more than adequate. Robbins remains a great book that you must digest. Good luck!	2003-01-07

Harrison's is the standard textbook for Internal Medicine and has been the standard for many years. It has done an admirable job of staying fresh, though I'm not sure the addition of an \\"alternative medicine\\" chapter belongs there any more than a chapter on atheism belongs in a new King James Bible, but whatever. The companion website is quite nice, though I have not figured out exactly how it will help me yet. The bottom line here is that if you are an Internist, you need Harrisons.	2003-01-07

This was one of the most useful little books a med student could hope for, a really concise look into a single subject area. I used it for my 4th year elective, then the next edition for my Rheum rotation as a PGY-II, and then throughout Fellowship. I give the latest edition to each med student who rotates through our Rheum clinic, but I find they are less and less impressed by it as the size of the Primer approaches that of a textbook. The information is still excellent, but I think it's getting too big for the niche it has always occupied. If you really want that much info, buy the latest Kelley.	2003-01-05

This book offers no real secrets and in no small part, it's not fully accurate. The author \\"borrows\\" liberally from elsewhere*, and much of what is original is flawed. He has a strong dislike of Harvard and Princeton and this is overly obvious all too often. Also, suggestions such as not applying to colleges that \\"stoop\\" to asking you whether you had help in preparing your essay (such as Duke) are self-serving; in this instance, the author knows the colleges are checking not to see if the work has been reviewed by parents, teachers or friends (which they assume it has been), but rather to see whether you have hired a \\"professional college counselor\\" to do your work for you (the author is one of these). We bought this book as we prepared our 2nd child's application on the off chance that some hidden pearl would be worth the price of admission; none was present. Instead, I suggest the original (*) \\"A is for Admission\\", written by someone who has actually been on the AdComm at an Ivy.	2003-01-04

Bruce Catton is, in my opinion, the most readable author of American Civil War history. Whenever I've labored through some book I wanted to read but have struggled with, I reward myself with something he has written. This trilogy is, as all his work is, thoroughly researched and very balanced. It would be hard to detect any bias in this native Michiganer of the first half of the 20th century, though I vaguely suspect he had more sympathy for the South, if only for the \\"pluck\\" (he likes that word in fact) of their \\"David vs. Goliath\\" undertaking. This 3rd volume is the Pulitzer Prize winner, and with good reason. Essentially, Catton deals here with the classic struggle of Grant vs. Lee, but he does so in such a way that illuminates Grant in a light that is not only pleasing, but obviously genuine. This fine Army of the Potomac, so thoroughly identified with McClellan, was in fact a sharp instrument waiting for a leader like Grant to come along and put it to good use. Grant implicitly understood the assignment and the way to carry it out in the shortest time possible, which argues for his humanity, not his cruelty as other authors have intimated. Proof of his character is clear in the Instrument of Surrender, which was as far-sighted as any such document could have been (Sherman's, just a bit later, may have been a bit too generous for the politicians; it had to be revised in order to be accepted by Washington and to prevent the renewal of hostilities with Johnston). In any case, the real beauty of any of Catton's works is his insight not so much into the Grants and Lees, but into the common soldier of both sides; what made them fight so savagely one moment, but embrace one another so fully the next? The answer lay in the strange brotherhood that developed between the men of the Army of Northern Virginia and those of the Army of the Potomac. These men, after many years of hardship and privation and death, were a bit more likely to see their generals as the cause of their suffering and a lot more likely to see the tens and hundreds of thousands on both sides who stayed home while they fought as the real enemy. In this common bond, Catton intimates, lay the seed which made reunification at least palatable in the minds of so many men from so many distant places.	2002-12-07

I have never panned a book about Lincoln before, but there's a time and a place for everything it seems. This book is well researched, insightful, and in some places even illuminating, but it reads like a doleful college thesis, lacking a cohesive focus and existing without any tempo or cadence or rhythm whatsoever. Lincoln himself is not exactly the central figure, nor is the Gettysburg Address. For a while it seems Edward Everett is the focus, then the history of ancient cemeteries looms largest, with rambling discussions of Greek and Roman resting places and their evolution from urban to rural, etc. etc. etc. I suppose in all fairness, I should mention that Gettysburg, the place, is the subject. Do yourself a favor: visit the Memorial, skip the book.	2002-12-06

Whenever I've labored through some book I wanted to read but have struggled with, I reward myself with something he has written.

In any case, this first volume delivers a very important message in a very complete way, and it's a message I had never before considered: The Army of the Potomac's loyalty to the government was never compromised, but it was fretted about in some pretty high places, perhaps not the least important of which was in the White House. So completely was this Grand Army made in the image of its creator, McClellan, that his removal gave cause for many to hold their collective breath and pray that it would remain intact and loyal to the Union once stripped of its beloved leader. That it did, and the rest, as they say, is history. McClellan is thoroughly understood by the reader of this work. He is a man of some complexity and some sympathy, diminished by his ego perhaps. Despite many lost opportunities that would have made the war much shorter and correspondingly less bloody, he was a good soldier caught between military logic and political caution. In fact, Catton points out to us that never before had there been a general of a great army of a democracy, and that that arrangement itself is tenuous at best. In the end, we understand that the Army of the Potomac was Lincoln's Army for just as long as he remained the Commander-in-Chief, and despite their love for McClellan, they always stood ready to do what was asked of them.	2002-12-05

To a Civil War buff, the story of the Hunley is irresistable. The book begins with the conception and execution of the \\"fish boat\\" in Mobile and continues with its introduction into service in Charleston. The book then interweaves the distant past with the very recent past, telling the tale of the boat's crews (3 crews, none who answered to 'Lucky') and the tale of the multiple personalities involved in raising her some 135 years later. The writing is only adequate; the story of the boat and her design is more interesting reading than that of her crew and her salvagers. Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable book that can easily be read in one (pleasant) day.	2002-11-21

I was given this book by my daughter, and I had read from it from time to time. It is in fact a book that very much lends itself to that sort of intermittent reading, as the letters stand well enough on their own and are not part of any particular plot or developing idea. However, when my audiobook account had a balance on it that had to be used, I decided to download this book and have the letters read to me. With more than a dozen readers of excellent quality, and given the wonderful selection of the letters themselves, the narration occupied several days of my commute in a bittersweet but overall pleasant manner.	2002-11-02

This is a look at the tragedy that not only took nearly 1,200 innocent lives, but almost certainly sealed Germany's fate in WWI. It is told from many perspectives and with a balanced and non judgmental approach by this excellent author. Included are looks at such diverse characters as Alfred Vanderbilt, who as it turns out was quite the hero in the ships' final minutes (Vanderbilt and many others can be seen at the website that serves as a virtual companion to this book: ... and U-20  Kapitnleutnant Walter Schweiger, whom I suppose would argue \\"he was just following orders\\". ...Also included is a rather balanced indictment of the U.S., British and German governments' roles in failing to prevent or in causing this senseless disaster, as well as a much more modern look at efforts to recover the remains of Lusitania ...

If you're interested in 20th century history, this book is an essential read. The author reviews the world between the wars from the perspective of each major player, explaining their internal struggles and their adopted creed (Imperialism, Fascism &amp; Nazism, Communism, etc.), the understanding of which makes the tragedy that ensued seem almost inevitable. To be sure, this is a heavy-weight book that requires the reader's full attention. The author is a gifted writer with an expansive vocabulary and a clear understanding of the subject matter.

Nonetheless, the book itself was not an easy read, in part I think because Caro's portrait of LBJ is of a man so offensive that I think I would not have wanted to have been in the same room with him for more than 10 minutes. The book really begins with LBJ's election to the House, glosses over his war years and picks up with his election to the Senate in a race that earned him the facetious moniker \\"Landslide Lyndon\\". He was certainly a master of the workings of government, using whatever means were necessary to get his way. There are ample examples of his dishonesty, cruelty, coarseness and plain mean-spiritedness. In addition, his pitiful treatment of LadyBird and his near total disregard of his daughters are also well documented. In point of fact, it was difficult to find any redeeming qualities at all in LBJ, and the so-called Great Society husbanded by this long-time racist can only be explained in political terms, not in any humanistic epiphany he might have experienced. In any case, the book is well executed, but like a well thought out horror house, the effect is unsettling.	2002-09-06

Brands has done a splendid job researching Franklin for this engrossing biography about the most influential American of his time. (I suppose it would be wise to add that 'his time' was just slightly before Washington's, a fact that no doubt prevented him from becoming the first President. Insofar as 'most influential' goes, he was, at least in terms of European matters, the only American of great influence during the Revolutionary period. But I digress....). What makes the book so readable, aside from the subject himself, is the wry wit of the author, deftly inserted so as not to intrude upon the readers' relationship with Mr. Franklin. Lastly, I must tell you that the book is not filled with only worship and praise; it is quite evenhanded and certainly points out some of the (dare I say) weaknesses in Franklin's character. All in all, this is one of those books you'll be glad you bought in hardcover.	2002-09-05

This excerpted work is a light summary of American History from the perspective of a good friend and ally. It is not, however, a book that would have been taken seriously had it not been written by Churchill. To students of U.S. history, it will seem too superficial in most places (eg. Industrialization), too romantic in others (eg. the Civil War), and downright misleading in still others (imagine anyone describing Jefferson as 'frugal'!!). Having said all that, I enjoyed it precisely because it is our cousin's celebration of his own American roots.	2002-08-14

The evacuation in 1942 and subsequent return in 1944 of General MacArthur to the Philippines is certainly emblazoned in most American minds. One of his two most famous utterances, \\"I shall return\\", places a set of brackets around the years he was in Australia, as though nothing much happened until the cameras immortalized that return. Unfortunately, the war didn't stop for the tens of thousands of Americans and Filipinos left behind under Generals Wainwright and King. Their story was one of decimation on the battlefield, humiliation in surrender, and torture and death in captivity. The book is very readable, well researched and truly a page turner. The real heroes come to the fore, beginning with the bravery of General King (himself the grandson of a Confederate General) in not sacrificing his men needlessly, and continuing with figures such as Captain James C. Fisher, M.D. (KIA) and M/SGT Abie Abraham, the former Army boxing champion who survived whatever the Japanese threw at him along the Death March from Bataan and in Cabanatuan camp. The mission of the Army Rangers (Hooah!) is beautifully detailed, and their daring rescue attempt is far more exciting than anything Hollywood could ever dream up. Read the book and set the record straight; the real heroes never left.	2002-07-27

The book nearly seems suspended in mid air, starting as it does at the close of a long-evolving, complex story. I found it readable and entertaining, with ample research and little  bias detectable on the part of the author (to be more honest, I'd have to call his mildly pro-Yank view refreshing). I suppose it shouldn't have surprised me that the story is about 80% Soviet; the French, Brits, Americans &amp; even the Germans are relegated to supporting roles in this story. Clearly, the Russians (i.e. Stalin) knew that getting to Berlin first would be their best defense in claiming it as a base for the post-WWII Europe they hoped to master. I read the book as a last chapter in my review of WWII. Instead, it should be read as the opening work on the Cold War.	2002-07-26

I had some misgivings about delving so deeply into the foreboding world of Adolph Hitler, fearing perhaps that knowing about all the minutiae of a protagonist whose legacy still conjures up such dreadful revulsion might imbue him with qualities that could make him seem \\"regular\\", or God forbid, even sympathetic. The book is an exhaustive work of nearly 1,000 pages, though it is thoroughly engrossing and the time passed quickly thanks to Toland's great literary talent. <BR>What emerges is a rather non-editorialized look at an improbable man who happened to have been endowed with some talents and considerable single-mindedness at exactly the right (or wrong) time and place to \\"blossom\\". The reader comes away with an understanding of Germany between the wars and hopefully with an appreciation of the great importance that must be placed on treaties not as a means to end one conflict but rather to avoid another. Of course, I do not excuse what happened, but it is clear that National Socialism grew all too well in the bitter agar of Versailles. <BR>Aside from Hitler, his most intimate circle is well developed, including Himmler, Goebbels, Goring & Eva Braun. Occasional glances at Mussolini, Franco and others add more depth. His conflicts with the General Staff progress throughout the book, and they are the mirror into which Corporal Hitler cannot stand to gaze. The more things go astray, the more grotesque the image he sees becomes, and naturally he is sure it is the looking glass, not himself, that is responsible. <BR>This book did not make me see Hitler as more or less of a human being; he remains what he was, a destroyer of people, most especially of his own people. It is no small irony that his last dictation in the bunker makes no apologies for the 6 million Jews he murdered, but rather predicts that he will one day be celebrated for it throughout the world. Instead, his acts brought down the German state and spawned the Jewish state that without him might not yet have come into being.	2002-07-12

I used to ride horses myself, and every now and then you find a horse whose gait is rocking-horse smooth and the feeling is awesome. McCullough's writing is much the same, and when the subject is T.R., well, you just can't miss. This book looks at T.R.'s early life, from his childhood to his unsuccessful run for Mayor of New York. It is a book then of roughly &quot;the first half&quot;, and as such it does an admirable job of reporting his amazing accomplishments, while setting the stage for his incredible &quot;second half&quot;. As is the author's habit, peripheral characters are brought to life vividly and their influence on T.R. is made clear. I particularly enjoyed the understanding of the vital roles his father and his elder sister played. McCullough obviously likes Roosevelt, but he doesn't allow his opinion to color the writing too much. The book is, as expected, a gem.	2002-06-13

This one volume biography of FDR is probably the best distillate possible, though the task is daunting and the result is less than perfect. At times, the book 'drags' a bit, particularly through the 30s. Explanations of New Deal politics perhaps don't lend themselves to the kind of exciting story-telling that wartime meetings at places such as Tehran and Yalta do. In fact, I sometimes felt the book lapsed into an economics textbook, but it is still mostly quite readable.

McCullough is a master of the English language. This was my first non-biography of his and though it was very entertaining, it was not quite as captivating as his John Adams or Truman. The book is divided naturally into the French effort and the American effort, with ample interlocking references. Fleshing out the individual principal characters is McCullough's strong suit, and as always, they seem to come alive in this book. Research is complete and lends just enough detail without becoming too tedious. The book seems to end rather abruptly, but then again that seems to be historically accurate, as much of the fanfare was lost in the European conflict that had erupted just as the Canal was opened. In any case, this is a job well done and a book worth reading.	2002-03-18

Nonetheless, Professor Joseph Ellis makes an effort to make sense out of a man whose own life was such a riddle. <BR>Perhaps the first thing to understand when reading a book by this author is that it is scholarly, not light reading. There are facts and allegories, to be sure, but mostly there is a philosophical attempt to distill the essence of Jefferson. This is not for the faint-hearted, and Ellis shrinks from nothing.<BR>The very core of the distillate, he argues, is American individualism, the unwillingness to be governed except when faced by a common (unifying) threat. In the absence of such a unifier, Americans inherently distrust government and give their consent only grudgingly. Ellis argues convincingly that this is exactly what Jefferson himself would have wanted, a people who remain possessive about their individuality and who adjust their government as their changing needs may require.<BR>The epilogue of the book, however, strikes me as a bit too pedantic. The author in effect belittles not only the continuous political co-opting of Jeffersonianisms, but he actually names the Internet and chat rooms on AOL (!) as tools which Jefferson would have very much approved of, but which are mostly (entirely?) filled with comments and conversations about Jefferson that are complete and utter nonsense. <BR>Personally, I agree with the former premise and take exception to the latter. Jefferson belongs to us all and no one, not even Professor Ellis, has cornered the market on Jeffersonian Truth.	2002-02-15

US	52765756	R2X32X67YADUNB	0671456547	680068737	Truman	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	A Masterpiece.	McCullough is the finest writer of his genre today. If the amazing popularity of his John Adams' biography wasn't enough to convince you of his skill, this book certainly will. The research is impeccable, the detail intricate and the style so readable that the nearly 1,000 pages go by in far too short a time. I had read Hamby's Truman and nearly choked on it, but I am glad I gave HST another look, because his story, as told by (an admiring but balanced) McCullough makes a great case for the comment that Harry Truman was exactly the man the Founding Fathers had in mind when they put their faith in the future of our popular government.	2002-01-11

I enjoyed this well-documented and largely sympathetic work on Longstreet. It certainly makes a good case for his having been unfairly cast as the scapegoat for several debacles, such as at Gettysburg. However, there is also presented excellent evidence of his &quot;lapses&quot; at other battles which at first seem so uncharacteristic, but then become part of an obvious pattern throughout his life of inconsistency, military and otherwise. <BR>In any case, the book makes good reading and supports Longstreet as having been, overall, the South's best Corps commander.	2001-10-17

Bruce Catton's Grant Takes Command is a wonderful look into the role U.S.G. played in reversing the fortunes of the Union. Operating quite independently in the West, Grant's career was not always in ascendency, but his tenacity in the seige and capture of Vicksburg certainly earned him an opportunity to command at a higher level (though this was not necessarily what he had in mind). That meant a transfer east to the politically charged world of wartime Washington, as well as a 3rd star, placing Grant in the position of General-in-Chief of the Union Armies. How he mastered the assignment that so overwhelmed those who came before him is beautifully retold in this book. In the end, there can be no doubt that the humble General Grant was a man of remarkable political and military judgment, without whom it is almost certain the Confederacy would have prevailed.	2001-08-04

Jay Winik writes with great style and substance from a perspective many may overlook. The United States was an entirely unique experiment in spontaneous self-government, and while the mold may have been cast in 1776-1787, the nation would take many decades to cure. In one crucial month, April, 1865, the as-yet fragile vase could well have cracked and crumbled into dust. Instead, as the author points out, a group of men, including Lincoln, Lee, Grant &amp; Johnston, made careful decisions that would preserve the Nation for posterity. Winik details the deeds and animates the men with great literary light, and one cannot help but marvel at how a second unique event, a true National healing, enveloped the United States as a result of their wisdom.	2001-06-25

Having said that, it's not an engrossing book that's hard to put down either. Nonetheless, I plodded through it over a month and I am glad I did. Jefferson Davis remains an enigma to most Americans; how could someone who had studied at West Point, served in our military, been a Senator and a Cabinet officer lead a rebellion against the very nation he professed to love for so long? The book reveals the answer and makes a convincing argument that Davis neither hated The United States of America nor loved the vile institution of slavery. In his view, and perhaps in the view of many if not most of his Southern contemporaries, the largest viable sovereign political entity was the State, not the Union. Put simply, Davis was a Mississippian, and as long as Mississippi chose to associate itself with the other states of the Union, so too would Davis. But he believed very deeply in the Jeffersonian principle of decentralized government, and Federal mandates were an affront to his interpretation of the Constitution. The book makes his case admirably and tells the story of that period from an interesting perspective. It will not disappoint the reader whose views may be different than those of Mr. Davis.	2001-03-31

George Washington's War was my first book by Robt Leckie, who has since become one of my favorite authors. The book looks at a fairly long period in our history, and in that sense the title is misleading. Nonetheless, Washington is the pivotal character in the story that begins with the French-British struggle for North America and ends with the British expulsion to the north. The story is told even-handedly, and while Washington himself is beyond reproach, American policy making and execution will make most citizens squirm rather frequently. I have a strong feeling I'll re-read this book somewhere down the road.	2001-02-06

No doubt the case of Benedict Arnold gets short shrift in most elemental high school text books. As a result, Arnold is seen as a murky figure (Dark Eagle?) who betrayed his country at the very moment of its birth in order to improve his own lot. This is a partial truth. In fact, Arnold was America's greatest fighting General throughout the early years of the Revolutionary War (as Washington was the greatest retreating General in that same conflict....no disrepect intended), and for multiple, purely political reasons dealing with the different states' insecurities, he was perhaps the least recognized. In fact, he financed his entire army, and never received adequate recognition or reimbursement from the Congress. In any event, the book makes a compelling case for Arnold. It is wonderfully written, hard to put down. The reader is mesmerized by the injustices done to General Arnold, and saddened by his ultimate treason. Brought sharply into focus are many other players on that stage, including Washington, Major John Andre and a host of mediocre Generals who were green with envy at Arnold's prowess. There is a reason for such books to be written: we must learn from our errors and see that they are not repeated.	2000-12-14

Mr. Ambrose tells the story of the last year of the war in Europe in a workman-like manner. His style is unpretentious, not unlike the men (and women) of the WWII generation. Weaving the personal stories of the hundreds of men he (and his son) has interviewed from both sides, the book is a tapestry that moves steadily eastward from Normandy to Berlin. By the end of the book, the author has told the VE story almost completely from the perspective of the GI, not the 'brass'. It is a refreshing change, and a reminder that wars are fought in foxholes by men, not in smoke-filled rooms by politicians.	2000-12-07

Brands has done a splendid job researching Franklin for this engrossing biography about the most influential American of his time. (I suppose it would be wise to add that 'his time' was just slightly before Washington's, a fact that no doubt prevented him from becoming the first President. Insofar as 'most influential' goes, he was, at least in terms of European matters, the only American of great influence during the Revolutionary period. But I digress....). What makes the book so readable, aside from the subject himself, is the wry wit of the author, deftly inserted so as not to intrude upon the readers' relationship with Mr. Franklin. Lastly, I must tell you that the book is not filled with only worship and praise; it is quite evenhanded and certainly points out some of the (dare I say) weaknesses in Franklin's character. All in all, this is one of those books you'll be glad you bought in hardcover.	2000-10-16

In fact, the author has a splendid awareness  of the history and of the times, and has obviously read and researched each  character so extensively that they truly 'come alive' by virtue of the  technique. While no one recorded the private conversations of James and  Dolly Madison (et al), I felt the text was probably an excellent  approximation of what their dialogue must have been. Many other characters  of the period come alive and interact, and the entire feeling is one of  great delight in having 'been there' to hear them speak. The period itself  is nicely covered as well. This is a great lesiurely read and would be a  wonderful way to read history for those who hate the textbook approach.	2000-09-08

Joshua L Chamberlain seems to be  one of the least likely men of his era to have become a war hero; he was  gentle, unassuming and almost academically cloistered. His decision to join  the Army was of course patriotic, but JLC gave up more than many men who  joined. He had just been promoted to a prestigious and newly created  European Studies Chair at Bowdoin, the acceptance of which not only carried  with it tenure, but an all-expense paid, 2 year tour of Europe. He saw his  duty elsewhere, and took part in raising the 20th Maine, which became a  legend under his and others' leadership. The book magnificently details  their deeds and JLC's rise to General Officer in the U.S. Army. At the end  of this great story, regardless of ones preconceived notions about Blue or  Gray, the reader will be pleased to have 'known' General Chamberlain.	2000-08-31

It was the first New Years Day of his Presidency, and the feeling was one of great goodwill; he was obviously at ease and well-liked. I was afraid, however, that the book would carry on from there, leaving out his rise to power. I was not then disappointed when the book flashed back to his early life and developed his character in a slow, methodical and often very entertaining manner, leading up to that New Years Day. T.R. was a man who had special gifts coupled with boundless energy. He was possessed of a number of qualities that might not endear him to many readers, but his sheer power, unbridled patriotism and the broad spectrum of his accomplishments is nothing short of humbling. The book is well-written and the protagonist is probably the most exciting figure in the American 19th century.	2000-08-25

I enjoy reading about people who achieve high office, fame or fortune,  probably because I want to find a link among them that predated their  successes. In reading this excellent and very balanced biography, I came  away with at least 3 lessons: 1) That blind luck can be the key ingredient  in a man's success, for the early life and times of Chester Arthur no more  predicted greatness than did those of Harry Truman (Truman, at least, was  essentially honorable), 2) that is indeed possible for the Office to make  the man, for once he became President, Arthur overcame many of his moral  inadequacies, and 3) that for all we complain about American politics  today, the state of the State in the late 19th century was more corrupt  than most 21st century Americans would ever imagine possible.

I was left with a clear understanding of how Grant got to his zenith in the Civil War, but I was left wondering what insights he had into his failed Presidency. As the book was finished 20 years after the war, this seems a curious oversight. It is, of course, an autobiography, so it is necessarily an unobjective view of things. Nonetheless, one message is clear: Grant was truly a man who met with a moment, but who clearly might easily have spent his life as an anonymous merchant in Ohio or as a mathematics instructor at West Point. Once assuming command of the Union Army, he was an efficient leader, but perhaps not a brilliant tactician. What he brought to the table was tenacity, a will to fight, something his predecessors lacked. He latched onto Lee and never let go, understanding that attrition would favor the wealthier and more populous Union. The result was victory, but at an awful toll. Grant's memoirs paints a picture of an honest, unassuming and sometimes sentimental man who was designed for this one mission.
