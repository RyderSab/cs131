I only read about 100 pages of this book, so I'm sure I didn't get to the good part, but it just wasn't too bright of Heinlein to put the bad part all through the first 100 pages. I simply ran out of patience. The bad part is the supposed futuristic prose style of the narrative. I guess he was trying to pare down the language by removing ambiguous \\"it\\"s and \\"there\\"s from the speach of the characters. Sort of like if I said, \\"It's raining.\\" Well, since you have know idea what the \\"It\\" is in this sentance, you could well ask, \\"What's raining\\". Or I could say, \\"There's a man I want you to meet.\\" You could say \\"Where's a man you want me to meet?\\" Heinlein removes these confusing and unnecessary words from the English language and yields sentances like, \\"Is raining.\\" or \\"Is a man I want you to meet.\\" There. Isn't that better? No. So I ask, \\"Is helpful to alter the language like this to help demonstrate that will be changes in way we communicate in future?\\" Well, Anthony Burgess's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" is proof enough that this kind of technique can work wonders. That book however seemed to be written by a man who could actually imagine his characters speaking in such a whacked-out manner. This book's \\"inventive\\" prose could've been \\"invented\\" by a word processor. Or a bottle of white out. Is Heinlein saying that in the future we will have to communicate with computers so regularly that we will begin to think like them? If so, why does he use silly colloquialisms like \\"the Yankees finished in the cellar\\" which were basically dead at the time he wrote this? Is it to show that some things never change? Cute. But not funny. Not even funny once. Then there's all this long-winded \\"character development\\" wasted on characters that have less substance than the cast of Scooby Doo. The Professor (we call him Prof), The able bodied male Manuel O'Kelly (we call him Man), the brains of the operation (in this case a supercomputer called MIKE) and the utterly useless but somehow ubiquitous hot chick with the ridiculous name of Wyoming Knott (just don't call her Why Not?). Get it? It's stupid!... I hate this book more the more I think about it. <BR>By the way, the worst thing about all Heinlein is his relentless sexism. He repeatedly creates weak female characters, then pokes at their faults, then forgives them for having something like good intentions (just feeble minds and bodies). From what I hear, this is a guy who spent a lot of his life alone in the mountains. There really is something of the egocentric-misogynist-hermit archetype that is associated with right-winger fanatics and libertarians in Heinlein. Maybe that's why this book is popular with libertarians! Anyway, this book sucks. Stranger in a Strange Land was much better. So was Starship Troopers for that matter. They both had the same sad sexism and pretentiousness, but had more... heart.	2003-04-16
US	47064822	R2SACN6BN3VKT1	0679720227	169376079	The Fall	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Nice	This is a great little book about crawling up inside one's own mind and finding out that we are all original sinners. We hold the key to our own demise in our very nature. It should be depressing, but it's presented in such an entertaining manner that it's really kinda fun. Important to note that it's just philosophy and therefore only one of an infinite number of hypotheses reagarding what's wrong with the human race. We may be messed up, and this may indeed explain why, but it's better to muse about this stuff than to take it seriously. After all, free will demands that we have the will to be free. And that may be the only true means of salvation.	2003-01-07
US	47064822	R3JENUEUCAYBVZ	0393312801	163144266	The Acid House	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Tear on through it.	For just the end story, \\"A Smart C***\\", The Acid House is worthwhile. Welsh is often super morbid and seriously wickedly wacky in these short stories, most of which play out a lot more like bad dreams than pristine vignettes. The closing aforementioned novella, however, is diferent. It's a surprisingly moving character study of a guy who seems to completely lack character. The guy is so totally caught up with analyzing everything surrounding him that he forgets to live. This seems to be subject matter close to Welsh's heart, and he gives it a surprisingly sympathetic treatment. The other stories range all over the place, but have enough energy to make up for a lack of direction. Gotta love Irv. You just gotta.	2003-01-07

I may have even been one; in a manner of speaking. I was definitely drunk. Buckowski likes to read and drink and tell what's on his mind. These qualities make him a clear-cut role model for the aspiring drunken hipster, as he sets a template for behavior that is amoral, yet ethical. He doesn't stand for phony-baloney golden rulism, just honesty and willfullness. In a way, he can be read as a sort of Buddhist in the way he recognizes his own id as well as the ids of others. This book is simply one of the best chapters in what is really one gigantic work that spanned his lifetime.	2003-01-07

It deals with the real issue of race in a responsible, intelligent manner, in a way that is easily understood, yet not simplistic. We get enough cut-and-dried morality thrown at us, as well as much pathetically vague garbage about \\"tolerance\\", but not many people in primary public education deal with the main issues straight on. Baldwin views things in terms of the long-haul, but warns that things cannot remain as they are without serious repercussions. In a time when black youths have less and less to look to in the mainstream, I think it would be a great move to get this book put into the public High School curricula.	2003-01-06

A big theme in this book is the relativity of mortality when one considers the permanence and endless replicability of DNA. Why couldn't a person live forever and be constantly at their prime? You start to fade, you clone yourself. If the world's leaders did just that, what would become of the society around them? That in itself is an interesting question, but Gibson just takes it and runs with it. His world building is very far-reaching, if a bit biased toward his love of psychedelic drugs and virtual reality. In other words, this is a lot more like a trip into one man's mind than a glimpse into the future. Then again, if one leader can prolong his life indefinitely, how long would it take for the outer world to mirror his inner mind? Anyway, I'm impresed enough with this book to be glad William Gibson is not president.	2003-01-06

In a way he's more of a dying breed. You know the unemployable Rennaissance Man. The all-too-obviously-talented misfit with the big head and bigger heart. Sure you see them all the time now, but are they authenitc, or are they Henry Miller [imitations]? By writing Tropic of Cancer, Miller may have made men like himself obsolete. Or maybe I'm just trying jerk your chain with [inexpensive] ideas the same way he does. Maybe I'm an [imitation]. Anyway, it's dirty, ugly, and very pure. Without Miller's influeince we lose out on William S Burroughs, Charles Buckowski, Bob Dylan, Jim Carroll, Lou Reed, punk rock, cyberpunk, Irvine Welsh, Hal Hartley, Denis Johnson, and other slightly altered [imitations] who continue to make our culture worthwhile.	2002-12-28

I t does a good job of examining the psyche of a woman who can't remain faithful to the man she loves. While I might have previously considered the main character's behaviour an example of (wo-)mankind's endless ability to justify selfish acts, I got some perspective on aspects of the main character's psyche which was evidently much needed. This is sort of anti-existentialism, where people are small and subject to pulls from their gender, class, race, and age, never mind their impulses. It doesn't justify chronic faithlessness, at all, but it does present a certain disphoric reality where only the very strong can be responsible for the consequences of their actions.	2002-12-16

Jesus' son is a very short collection of short stories that should take the average reader no time to get through. It is great in two ways. First, it is very effective in demonstrating the lost and agitated mindset of a drug-addicted lovable loser bumbling his way through the '70's. Second, Johnson's writing manages to be somehow both florid and lean, with exactly the right details magnified for effect. A quick, but engrossing read, Jesus' Son could be a 5-star book, but it's too short.	2002-12-13

It had brilliant ideas about human nature and the origins of religious faith. It was more humanistic than most Dick novels, something sorely lacking in some, but it still uses the ideas to move the characters, which is never good. Here, the characters are made out to be the originators, not just instruments of the ideas, so it does make some sense that they would be motivated to follow the ideas wherever they lead. It's just that this motion tends to turn the characters into robotic true-believers, and thus instruments of the plot. I don't mean to dis, cause PKD is a brilliant thinker, and damned if I could do a better job, I'm just saying that there are unfortunate flaws in his writing style that make him a little less fun to read than say Robert Anton Wilson. Or Tom Robbins. Or Kurt Vonnegut. Or Chuck Palahniuk. Or... nevermind. This is a very good book!	2002-12-13

It's a military psychological thriller in which some POW US soldiers are brainwashed and sent home; all programmed to do damage to the government when they get there. Given that the men are war heroes, it isn't hard for them to get a foot in the door where they can really wreak havoc. The plot twists around in ways too creepy to be believed, yet too familiar to be completely discounted...heh heh heh. It's definitely readable as a thriller, but does good double duty as a quasi sci-fi conspiracy novel, not to mention the informed and responsible portrayal of US military intelligence. I wanted to call it Kurt Vonnegut meets Tom Clancy, but that's not doing it justice. Maybe it's out-of-print because it couldn't find a niche. Or maybe THEY don't want you to read it.	2002-12-13

My dad swears he read these books to me as a child. Although I have no recollection of this, the stories have always been there in my consciousnes, without explanation. Obviously, they made their mark. Now with the Super-Sized Lord of the Rings Fever at full tilt, I decided to read them all by myself.<br />I have to say that the Fellowship of the Ring starts very slowly. Almost painfully so. If you saw the movie, then the 10 minutes or so of scenes from the Shire in the film correspond to about 150 pages of the book. When things do pick up, it becomes very interesting. You won't come across this level of vividness in many current novels. You may get to feeling like you know middle earth more intimately than you know your own neighborhood. It's a bit of a commitment, but it pays off.<br />The Two Towers is more action packed and scary than the Fellowship, and is probably the best of the bunch. It is full of intrigue and wild characters who really pull you in deeply. You will feel more emotions reading this one than the other two combined. It's basically the climax of the series.<br />The Return of the King is surprisingly short and unceremonious considering all the buildup in the Two Towers. It's actually sort of a letdown, as it climaxes to soon and peeters out at the end.<br />I don't want to ruin any plot points for anyone who doesn't know the plot already, but I will say that the movies most likely won't be able to cover as much ground with as much depth as the books do. What else is new? It's just that you're talking about some really involved books when three 3 1/2 hour movies feel incomplete by comparison.<br />I definitely recommend the Lord of the Rings to anyone who loves a good story.	2002-12-12

I find it a bit disturbing to see a cutesy picture of Leonardo DiCaprio on the cover of this book. It's not the sort of things most suburban thirteen year old girls would enjoy. This is a sharp, funny, and undeniably exciting account of a guy who lived life like there was no tomorrow in NYC in the early 60's. Basically it's all sex, drugs, and rock and roll with some basketball thrown in idiosyncratically to demonstrate the straight life young Jim Carroll is throwing away. What makes it so good is the vividness of the descriptions. I think it would be harder for an older person to write so honestly and fearlessly as Carroll does here. Most of us have only occasional glimpses of the harsh clarity that pervades this entire book. I'm most reminded of Henry Miller, and to a leser extent William S. Burroughs. I'd happily give it 5 stars if it didn't make me so queasy.	2002-12-12

Devoid of nuance, imagination or orignality, American Psycho simply attempts the \\"blunt object to the back of the head\\" approach to try to provide shock, while deeply and repetitively underscoring a misanthropic idee fixe, in part by showing as much disrespect to the reader as Pat Bateman shows his victims. I stayed up all night in the Milan train station surrounded by some truly creepy characters, basically amused at the pretentious (stuff) I was reading to stay awake. This isn't satire, unless you count the fact that it has been so highly praised as sort of a satire on modern pop culture.

Mid-twenties, urban, hip enough to know what's-what, and, above all, hungry. This book is a story of the early lives of four friends who, despite character differences, remain inseperable through early adulthood. Sounds like a chick flick, eh? It is, only the chicks are guys with major sex, drug, and self-destruction drives. We see these guys, as they take turns narrating the story. Each has a very distinct take on things while all are somehow familiar. Welsh is the best writer I know of for putting the reader into the mind of the characters.

I guess I take the bad with the good. Many people have written about the sexism, homphobia, and overbearing machismo of Heinlein's writing. I couldn't agree more. These flaws make it difficult to recommend this book, but I still do. What Heinlein does is ARTICULATE his ideas. He does this extermely well, making him more understandable than many sci-fi writers. Heinlein uses Jubal Harshaw to help make concrete sense of Mike's ideas, which are,(admit it), more sophisticated than \\"free-love->sexism->fascism!\\". The essential point of the book is easy to grasp, and although the pretense and arrogance of the author aren't much fun, any strong minded person need not feel threatened by these problems. The book is good for it's ideas more than its execution. Give it a chance.	2002-01-22

I read trainspotting in about three days, which, for me, a semi-literate, self-absorsed, junkie teenager is pretty good. I didn't have a bit of difficulty with the dialect, in fact Welsh has a much better writer's ear than noted &quot;greats&quot; Pynchon or Burroughs. All you have to do is hear it in your head, a skill which comes naturally for those of us who move our lips when we read. And nobody puts you in the picture like Irv. Of course he steals from his predecessors, but that just shows he has good taste. As for a lack of a plot; here's the plot: Margaret Thatcher's Tory Administration served to seriously damage Scottland's (and working class England's) economy. Once well-payed and well respected workers were now often broke or on the dole (that's &quot;slang&quot; for welfare). Pour newfound poverty and strife into ill-considered project-style tenement housing (they call them &quot;schemes&quot;), add Heroin to the mix and you end up with this tragic generation of self-absorbed, absurdist junkies. If you understand the context, the resultant ride is fascinating. And entertaining as hell!	2002-01-17
