I read alot but I don't write that many reviews. This one has to have one. I was ok for the first one hundred pages but on page 108 something happened and I read the rest in tears. This is a great lesson for parents of sick children and parents of seemingly well children. After all we as parents are not given any promises. I checked this copy out from the library but I want my own copy to make notes in and keep on my own shelf. I plan on letting my friends and family in on this little gem.	2004-02-06

It says so much about being young, being old and also just being alive. I do admit to being one of Berg's biggest fan, but this is another one that I will keep on my shelf after reading.  The voice is only 13yrs. old going on 30 or 40. I plan on writing down a few of the observations made in this one so that I don't forget them. When I realized I was getting dangerously close to the end, I slowed down and even stopped for awhile to prolong the feeling it was giving me. The feeling that living was a very good thing even though at times it could also be quite painful. I wish I could tell Ms. Berg personally how much I enjoyed and appreciated her writing. I can and will tell you!	2002-08-27

Make no mistake about this review, although it's not the highest I am a Stephen King fan and will more than likely read anything he puts out.

I wrote a review about this book when I was almost half way through it but I must add a few words. When I finished I wanted to call Ms. Berg or e-mail her or anything just to make sure she's busy writing another book. I can't wait another 2 years to read her.  She touches the reader in so many ways and she says things you want to write down and savor. She says things you want to show other people. So once again I say Buy this book to keep after you read it and buy an extra to give to someone you love and who loves to read. Also, if by any chance you should ever read this, Ms. Berg please don't wait so long for the next one we all need it soon and thanks for them all.	2002-04-05

Thanks Elizabeth Berg for another one. The stories could have been pulled from journals of women or maybe even a man or two. That's how real they seemed to me. Written beautifully. I realize that I am a little biased since Ms. Berg has long been one of my favorite authors. She is one of those I am just waiting for a new release from.

The so-called poker games were barely a factor in the book and her also so -called friends you really never got to know.

I don't understand what the major point of the book was or if it really even had one. Here's the thing I wished that I hadn't actually bought the book because it's not a keeper.

I was so dissappointed. I just read 'Local Girls' and loved it. This is a book about a man who is discovered to not be what he has says he is for the past 13 years. One minute his wife and child love him more than life itself and the very next it is absolutely over. That's a little to cut and dry for real life. But, that's not the worst part, there's at least two more books inside this one story that I had rather hear about than this one! Last but not least why does Ms. Hoffman think she has to write a 'Travel Guide' for New England. She tells about the weather, the birds, the flowers and she does this over and over and over, etc. I read a review before I read this one but I decided that they had to be wrong. I'm sorry to say they were not. Don't waste your time!	2002-01-31

Before you know it you're well over half way  through. Keyes first book &quot;Watermelon&quot; kept me laughing. This one actually brought a few tears. It's not your average addict/recovery story. I like how it allows her to tell her story yet in the latter half you'll find certain parts of her story being retold with very different perspectives. It almost had me going back to look at certain parts again. I loved it and can't wait to read my third Marian Keyes book &quot; Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married&quot;.	2002-01-22

I hope my words will be able to adequately describe my surprise and pleasure when I discovered this book. It was totally by accident. Where has this author been all my life. She has many more and I plan to hunt down everyone of them. This book has over 400 wonderful pages. It's a page turner. The humor is great, and so are everyone of the characters. Her family, the husband and even a few off beat surprises. It kept me going right up to the end. I salute you Ms. Keyes you are a excellent writer. I'm glad I make my own decisions on what books to read because Oprah has missed another winner! Thanks for the good time I had with your book.

The way she writes captures the image of whatever is happening in the story or with the characters. I found myself back tracking just to hear the magical way  she had  with her verse and words,whether it was the night or the heat or what the heart was saying, I felt it. Don't let anything keep you from this one. When an author can take an ordinary story and weave this kind of spell it is special. I wanted to read it slowly to savor it, but I didn't I read it quickly indulging myself. As I neared the ending late at night I purposely put it down to save myself a small treat for the morning.

I so enjoyed reading this one and I am not an avid fan of John Grisham. This was funny and I couldn't wait to get back home,from my Christmas shopping sprees, to pick it back up again. I didn't want it to come to an end. I dare anyone to read this and not be just a little bit tempted to do the same thing that Luther wanted to do. I'm still considering it myself  for next year. Don't hesitate to buy this one and get an extra one to give as a present. It's good  for many laughs and the story wraps  up well. Just a little Christmas humor there.<br /> Grisham may want to consider writing comedy for a while. I read somewhere that odds are this one will be a made-for-televison movie by next year.

I think I can write a much more fair and accurate review.. but sometimes when the book hasn't impressed me it can come out a little more critical. This book is about a college teacher in his 30's dating his students. I realize that does sound a bit simple considering the book has almost 300 pages,but when I reflect that's about it. The author has made this character quite obsessed with his private anatomy. He really is quite good at coming up with all kinds of descriptive words concerning his part and what he does with it.Actually he tends to get pretty boring with his sex talk ,he throughs it in no<BR>matter what the situation happens to be. I hurried through the last to finish only because I wanted to see if anybody managed to live happy ever after. I'm not telling and I'm also not recommending this one.

I had planned on seeing the upcoming movie with my 16 year old daughter and now I'm worried she may think this really really bad girl behavior is cool. This girl was pretty bad even for the 60's. If you can read between the lines or maybe if you just want to see the bright side then you may enjoy this story. She was a stickler for writing details. The book is a mere 204 pages but probably could have been told in 100. I wouldn't say don't read it but don't say you weren't warned.	2001-10-12

High Fidelity started out telling the story of a young man and his two friends that all worked together in a record shop that the main character owned. They were men but sounded more like overgrown teenagers. They thought they all wanted to meet the right woman but when any woman entered their lives they immediately wondered what they might be missing out on. None of the characters had done much growing by the end and quite frankly it all got pretty boring and I was rushing for the ending. You get a feeling that the author really has a talent for writing but hasn't quite reached his potential. I had planned on giving this book three stars but that seemed a bit much. I read this book because I had previously read &quot; How To Be Good&quot; and I wouldn't recommmend either.	2001-10-08

These teens and the language they are using is not acceptable. I've had four teens and my share of problems but I've never had a teen stand and call me a name or say F.. you or anything even near this. This book brings up some very real situations but really offers little in the way of solutions. That stinks, I already know what the situation is I need useable advice on what works. The advice hear is don't push to hard and just let things slide after all they are just teenagers. In fact this book seems to say don't expect too much. Bull, if I say be home at 11:30 then be home at 11:30. I can't believe all the reviews were so great on this book. Come on parents who is the boss in your home!	2001-10-02

This story very adeptly explores the lives of four people.There a few extra characters but I'd say there were four main ones.  I was able to know how each character felt about what was going on in their own lives and how they felt about the other characters. I really enjoyed the way it moved in and out of each character's narrating the story. Sometimes it even back-tracked just a little and even that was well done. I'm afraid that this book may get overlooked because it quietly tells it story. The story itself is sometimes amusing and sometimes very poignant. Make sure you read lots of reviews if you're thinking of not giving this one a shot. It will stick with you awhile too!	2001-10-01

Now I am almost finished(less than 20 pages) and I still have a lot of questions about Sarah, Deckard and Harry. The author gives you perspective from Deckard and Sarah, but I wonder what it would have been like to get inside little Harry's mind and hear from him. I really don't want to give the idea that this is a bad book but it left me wanting to know the real story and to dig a little deeper.<BR>    Finally, I must say I'm still mad that I read a reviewer on Amazon that decided to reveal the ending for all who read his or her review.

It just died out before it ever got started. I felt like pushing it forward myself. It would have been better even if it hadn't went the way I wanted if had just went somewhere. 300 pages of a unhappy marriage and that's it.

She changes time settings and voices at a rapid pace and she does it perfectly. After the story got rolling I read hungrily, devouring this book. Yet at the same time wanting to savor it. I even went back and reread the beginning which at that point was perfectly clear. I have read a couple of her others but I have not read anything quite as feverishly lately as this.

It reads just like a Danielle Steele, so if you like her type then you should be happy. The only difference is the reader is spared the details of the lovemaking. But because this is written by a man there are lots of occasions for making love, even when the two aren't getting along otherwise they still end up in bed. Women don't write that way. What a total waste of time. But honestly everything he has written thus far reads this same way in my opinion! Everything here is so stinking predictable.

It was very painful to read some of the occurences as a wife and a mother. I especially felt my heart go out to the younger child, Malcolm. I eagerly await another book from Ms. McFadden.  It was one of those books I knew had to end, but didn't want to let go of the characters.	2001-02-27

I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever loved their dog. I found  as I read it that it caused a fresh spark of interest for me with my own doggie. I am married and have children, but I could definetly relate to this single lady. I knew before I even finished that I would miss these two characters long after they were gone. It's a very good read.	2001-02-06

I read a lot of the other reviews and something did happen about half way through that really seem to mess up the story. Although I don't believe a book has to be a challenge to be good. I personally don't want every novel I read to be a challenge I would rather it be comfortable and call &quot;come pick me up and enjoy&quot;	2001-01-23

This book is so excellent,that after only 30 or so pages I was looking to e-mail author begging for her to write more! It is something modern and up to date and anyone could relate too. I have been re-reading events that made me laugh out loud! Don't miss this one PLEASE!!	2001-01-23

I have read everything I could get my hands on the she has written and I'm still waiting for more. She is one of those authors who you buy the book and Then you look at the cover. Another of mine is Ann Tyler!	2001-01-23

Because of the subject matter and the fact that this is happening everyday, I hate to say I loved this book, but I did! Reading this book from a mother's view, a father's, or even a child's is so touching. It is definetly worth your time. You will be tempted to read it straight through and then give it immediately to a friend.	2000-09-27

I know someone out there knows this feeling. She writes with  amazing insight to her characters. I know and appreciate them all. All I  can say is please don't let it be long before another one is written. If  your like Ann Tyler you will also like Elizabeth Berg. She is very human in  her writings.	2000-09-16
