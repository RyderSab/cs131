After working with Photoshop for over 10 years, I finally decided to take the plunge and give Painter a try. Being one of the only seven people on Earth that read the directions beofre working with a product, I bought Jeremy's book to give me an overview. It is everything I had hoped for and more. Just enough of the nuts and bolts to get me started,  but enough to be boring. A good, solid beginning (and intermediate) look at the capabilities of this program. the advanced techniques look like fun and are not presented in an intimidating \\"look how cool my artwork is\\" way.<br /><br />Yep, expensive, but worth it!!!<br /><br />KathyDV	2005-08-18

Like many others, I do not resonate with the reversals and resulting negative energy. It was all a bit overwhelming at first (so many cards, so little patience), but as I studied and read more and more, this deck began to make even more sense. I found the depth of the artwork to inspire me to look deeper and deeper for the meaning of the spread. Thank you, Amy and Monte, for making me THINK and be PATIENT!	2005-03-30

Personally, I can use some upliftment and positive energy to start my day with...or for any other time of the day! Great deck to give as a gift for those that are new to \\"all this woohoo stuff\\" as it will ease them into the concept of oracle deck.

I wondered about the lack of consistency in the artwork, but choose to enjoy each card for its own message and helpfulness. I prefer the consistency of a similiar mood to the artwork, but also enjoy seeing the different artists represented. Depends on what you are looking for in a deck if you REALLY connect with this one or not.

Crystal Therapy is a fantastic introduction to the metaphysical world of crystals. Does it cover every crystal? Of course not! But it certainly covers MOST of the ones that MOST of those working with crystals will ever be using. The way she connects the angels and crystals is work the price of the book alone. Does each description agree with all the other crystal books? Of course not, but no two books or sources completely agree anyway!<br /><br />Doreen is the BEST at gently bringing the metaphysical to the masses. THANK YOU to her for that!	2005-03-28

Healing With the Angels was one of the first of Doreen's books I read and I still go back and read and re-read it. It is a good starter book for working with angels and should be of great help! I liked how she stresses the idea that angels are for ALL aspects of life - ask them for help with everything, not just the big stuff. I call on my angels for everything - not running out of gas, safe travel, finding lost items, weather, I ask for everything OR the strength to handle whatever DOES come along. It is all in the intention :-D The cassette was also very useful and I leave mine in the car and enjoy listening to them over and over and over....	2005-03-28

I pulled this deck out to do a quick one card reading for myself before I did the review, as I always do, and the Listening card fell out (jumped, as Doreen says). I noted it, shuffled and recut the cards and yep, you guessed it, got the Listening card. That card is a validation from the angels that one really is hearing them and in communication with them.<br /><br />Moments like this happen all the time with this deck. Personally, I love the short verbiage on the card. Then it is your choice to go with your \\"gut\\" or read the \\"little white book\\" that accompanies the deck.<br /><br />It is easy to scoff at these decks until you use them. I know.	2005-03-28
