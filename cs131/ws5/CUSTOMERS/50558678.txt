Chimpanzees share something like 98% of our<br /><br />DNA, have been observed making and using tools,and have been shown to have the capacity for planning and working out complex social problems.<br /><br />And they share the same capacity for bigotry, hatred,and murder that humans have. This is the value of this book, it illustrates the data from actual observations of how close we really are, not sparing us from the negative observations because some might find the data offensive. If you are a christian fundamentalist I would suggest you avoid all books written by any scientist published in the last 100 years, and go start an anti-gravity movement. We all know that gravity is just a 'theory', so why should that be taught in schools?	2005-10-09

Why do all English Caucasian male<br />SF authors write from a female heroine narrative? I swear that the last ten books I have read by English White male SF authors<br />could have been written from the same generic template.<br />McAuley goes one better - we actively dislike the STANDARD FEMALE<br />HERO. She takes drugs, sleeps around with darn near anything and her closest friends are a lesbian couple who have &quot;their own&quot;<br />daughter via implantation. How PC!!!The Flight Engineer of the crew to Mars is a college and state football hero, mandatory brown skin, who &quot;habitually wears a baseball cap turned sideways&quot; with a &quot;PH.D in the esoteric<br />mathematics of eighteen dimensional space&quot; -you know how relevant<br />rappers are in advanced math!

Ursula Leguinn can handle<br />a variety of skin tones and biological makeups that have<br />dignity and value and dimension -this seemingly escapes her male<br />contemporaries.<br />If I wanted to read some standard politically correct,I am a modern kind of accepting-guy crap, I would venture to the new age section of the bookstore and not the Science Fiction section.<br />When the book is not offending you with two dimensional half-wit<br />characters, McAuley seems to be offering some mystical, cloudy,<br />objection to Dawkins et al, perspective on evolutionary genetics<br />without ever actually saying what the alternative might be, outside of some kind of 'holistic' approach. Please, Paul, stick to space operas -you really shine there, but lighten up on the Politically Correct crap - we are all getting very tired of cartoon characters.	2004-02-06

As Sawyer did, in his travesty 'hominoids', these aging white writers seem to be transfixed with inter-racial sex between a black male<br />and a very young white woman, and let the story wander all over<br />the place, with dead dialogue, idiotic plots - somehow hoping,<br />perhaps, that the Mandingo Sex in the book will save it.<br />Big Clue: - it doesn't. Just as in Sawyers most recent still-birth, this book just sucks outright and even the sex can't save it. No sense of wonder, no sense of awe, nothing. Now you<br />know why Arthur C. Clarke and Asimov and Reynolds did not have to stoop to the shuck and jive sex routines - they didn't need them -they wrote the poetry of the future.

However  footnotes are of books, obviously the author has chosen, to support his viewpoint. I made it to about 250 pages into this book. Mr.Loewens' version of the Civil War and Lincoln is so totally biased,it is offensive. From the book: &quot;...unlike the Nazi Swastika, which has been disgraced, even in the North, Whites still proudly display the Stars and Bars of the Confederacy...&quot;. So now we have Mr.Loewen equating the Confederacy with Nazi Germany. I guess Robert E. Lee, graduate of West Point and admired intensely by Grant and Sherman must be the rival of Himmler, or Hitler.  Page 177:&quot;... Lincolns concern about the crime of racism...&quot;. Geez, I did not know that Slavery and Racism are synonymous! I do believe some misguided souls might consider themselves superior to another ethnic group without necessarily enslaving them. Mr.Loewens account of the Civil War is really criminal. Read this book and then read &quot;April, 1865&quot;.  No mention at all is made of the sheer numbing butchery of Southerners by Sherman. Sherman, actually used to cry at night during the war because of the awesome number of northern and southern lives he caused terminated during the war.  If you want a good look at the mind of some radical leftist rewriting of American History read Mr.Loewen's drivel. Thank God, He is being largely ignored by textbook editors. I know that there were alot of atrocities affected by that evil of most evil: White men of European Ancestry, but for the love of the Almighty, one would hope Mr.Loewen would even TRY to be less biased. His glorification and rehabilitation of John Brown and complete dismissal of Nat Turner makes one wonder what Mr.Loewen's agenda actually is, it certainly isn't the truth. If a ruling White Male Conspiracy exists to censor the truth, then how did Mr.Loewen get his book published and how are you reading about it here?  It seems to be a trend of a number of college teachers to rework history to support certain social obsessions of theirs. If you are after objective information, this book is excellent in illustrating the new social Orwellian concept of rewriting the past to serve the present.ege teachers to rework history to support certain social obsessions of theirs.
