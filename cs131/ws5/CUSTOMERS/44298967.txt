At first I was confused by some of the older reviews, until I realized that Amazon is still selling the old 1st edition, and many folks are buying that one instead of the newer, much better Second Edition. <br /> <br />Be sure you're buying the Second Edition!  That book's ISBN is 0764559931.  It's the one with the picture of three authors on the cover.	2005-02-04

While some of the tips in this book were baffling (like the whole section on how sexy you should be; why is this relevant to my career?), most of this book was great. <br />	2005-01-14

But that's the way all great ideas work: once discovered, you can't imagine how you didn't think of that before.<br />I've loaned the book out to several co-workers and friends, but none of them have opened up the book, so their lives remain chaotic.  Buy the book.  And read it.  You'll be glad you did.<br />Prior to reading this book I had stacks of paper and files scattered around my office, and dozens of to-do items scribbled in three different notebooks and on scraps of paper.  I work hard but I never felt productive because I was aware of all of those action items around me that I wasn't finding the time or energy to get to.<br />After reading the book, my desk is clean, my floor is clear of stacks of &quot;stuff&quot;, and there's a set of trays on my desk that gets cleaned out in a methodical manner.  When I'm not at work, I'm not thinking of the hundred things I need to get accomplished the next day, because I have a plan in place.  All thanks to the book.<br />The author's cockpit idea is brilliant, and I'm in the process of trying to apply that idea to my garage and my kitchen at home.  I'm confident that this books will allow me to bring Order to those chaotic spots just like it did for my office.<br />One side note:  the author spends a few pages towards the back of the book trying to sell you her planners.  You might benefit from those planners, but you can adopt most of the author's tips and tricks using standard Franklin or Day-Timer planners instead.	2004-06-02

It treats a very important topic in a direct but humorous way; it's crammed full of useful bits of information; and it doesn't have all of those soft-core porn images that the other books seem to delight in.

The advice the book gave was great, particularly when it came to selecting the type of grass to plant for my particular needs and in my area.<br />The other reviewers are correct about the photos being not very useful, but they certainly are pretty!  However, I found the author's descriptions of grass types to be very clear and putting pictures of grass types would have been redundant.<br />There were a few things that could have used more coverage, though.  In particular, the description of the various options in boundaries and edgings was difficult to follow with very few pictures.  Plus, the section on sprinklers touched on only about half of the types of sprinklers offered by my local garden center.  <br />My neighbor across the street planted his lawn at the same time I did mine, but without the book.  He's a nice guy, but his lawn is a joke!  Maybe I'll loan him my book this Fall when he starts over....	2004-05-21

For example, I've read a number of books that analyze the strategies that built Wal Mart into the giant it is today, but none have been as interesting as this book's treatment of the topic.  Here's a bit from Chapter 4 of the book:<br />&quot;Like KISS, which had decided that starting out as a whale in a pond was better than starting out as a minnow in an ocean, Wal-Mart chose to build its brand and fan base in rural America, segment by segment, foregoing mass markets where it had relatively few differential advantages.  By staying away from cities and suburbs, Wal-Mart avoided head-to-head competition with giants Sears and Montgomery Ward.... winning fans town by town for several decades, gradually amassing scale.&quot;<br />The authors have packed the book with this sort of imagery, making the marketing concepts covered a snap to grasp.  To put it simply, this book rocks!	2004-05-18

Most recently the book taught me how to create screen capture movies that I can e-mail to others.  I'm using this trick mostly to create &quot;here's how you do this&quot; videos for my parents, which is a lot easier than trying to talk them through the computer challenge du jour over the phone.<br />Probably the next most useful sections of the book for me have been the parts covering User Profile managment.  I've never found those tasks to be intuitive in WinXP, and the book does a great job of showing me how I can finally get some benefit out of Profiles, rather than the headaches they've been giving me since I got WinXP.<br />The book has other chapters on these topics, too:<BR>*Working With Digital Cameras<BR>*Making Videos<BR>*Recording &amp; Ripping Music<BR>*Remote Control of Windows XP via the internet<BR>*Using Windows XP as an Internet Server<br />Plus, of course, chapters on security, backups, installing hardware/software, and the other sorts of topics you'd expect from PC Magazine.	2004-05-18

When she started going through RCIA there were a ton of questions from her, her family, and our friends about Catholicism.  I was stunned to find that I didn't know the answer to quite a few of those questions.<br />Catholicism For Dummies is the very best of the reference books I've found on the topic.  Most of the other books I've used to help answer questions about holy days, rituals, and of course Mary were hard to read, or assumed that the reader had quite a bit of prior knowledge.  But this book, just like it says on the cover, truly is &quot;the reference for the rest of us!&quot;<br />I'd recommend this book to every Catholic, as well as to anyone considering joining the church.	2004-05-15

If you know what you're buying, it's a good book (which is why I'm giving it four stars).<br />I bought this to read with my children.  Don't do that unless your kids are teenagers at least.  The original stories aren't meant for small children.  At a minimum the kids get bored; at the worst, they'll be terrified.<br />I didn't care for the quality of the book myself; it looks like it was layed out by somebody that normally designs dictionaries or phone books.  But you might like dense copy and inconsistent illustrations.	2004-05-13

I thought it was sort of odd at first, but once you've read it with a child a couple of times you'll be hooked.<br />It's a simple book, but the theme of \\"I'm your parent, and I'm with you through it all\\" is well done, and can be very comforting when you read it to your child.  The illustrations aren't intended to be overly humorous (I think), but my son and I laugh every time we see the little old lady rocking the full-grown son.<br />We used this book extensively with our oldest child after the second child was born.  It can be a great aid in getting over the rough spots (jealousy, competition, sibling rivalry etc) and reinforcing your bond with your first-born.	2004-05-13

There were big chunks of this book that were definitely worth reading, but overall it feels like at least a hundred pages of fluff and &quot;I'm a middle-aged pothead&quot; ramblings are used to stitch the thing together.<br />This would be a very compelling read if it were cut down to 40 pages or less.<br />Once you get past the wasted pages, you'll find some great nuggets that will get you thinking.  The one that sticks with me the most is the insight on why/how the very poor end up in $40/night hotels.  Also, the few peeks into why some women have little or no options when it comes to escaping an abusive relationship was fascinating.	2004-05-12

About half the humor is for grown-ups, but don't be afraid to try it out with a kid around the 1st grade level.  My son and I laugh ourselves silly whenever we read the book.<br />The art is great, and I love the hidden story on the inside of the dust jacket.  This is an oddly put together book (that's part of the hook), so it can be challenging to read the first couple of times, but it's certainly worth the effort.	2004-05-12

This book isn't as much fun for him as those, because at least 80% of the humor is intended for somebody no younger than 12.  <br />*I* laugh my head off whenever we read it; it's certainly a five-star book.  Just don't expect a young child to enjoy the book.	2004-05-12

Most sci-fi books are like James P. Hogan's hard sci-fi books, full of technology and long discussions between physicists.  While There Will Be Time has some tech and some science dialogue, it's really a story about some very human themes like good vs evil, finding your purpose in life, and what obligations the strong have to care for the weak.<br />I read this first as a teenager, and thought about it for years.  I found a used copy in my thirties that I've re-read several times, and I'm starting to wear that one out.  This is one of those rare books that I know I'll read over and over until my eyes give out.	2004-05-11

It's hard to go into much detail without giving away the story, but imagine this book as a look at how all of Creation might be the result of political infighting, poor communication, and assorted domestic disputes.	2004-05-11

But getting to the gems (emeralds?) is hard going, and I found myself dropping the book and picking up something else more than once while I tried to read this one.<br />Read the book if you're an Oz fan, or if somebody loans you a copy.	2004-05-10

There is some disturbing stuff in this book, and it makes you think twice about trusting minimum-wage strangers to prepare the food you eat.<br />I had no idea about the powerful group of a handful of organizations that are controlling the food we eat.  If I weren't so lazy, this book would make me start a farm so I can raise the food that my friends and family eats....	2004-05-10

The book design is like something you'd see in Cosmo or Lucky, or maybe one of the style magazines for metrosexuals.<br />If they're really going after the type of guy that needs the answers in this book, they should have packaged it more like a sports magazine or a tool catalog.<br />I don't *think* this is a bad book, but it's hard to tell.  On the few occasions that I've been able to find the part of the book that answers my question, it's been very helpful.	2004-05-10

I've moved seven times in the intervening years, and this book is one of only a dozen or so that have been worth hauling city to city, state to state.<br />As with other reviewers, I enjoyed the fresh spin on the first contact storyline, and the inclusion of a psychologist and a cosmologist in the group of main characters.  But having just re-read the book for the first time so far this decade, I have to say that my favorite part of the book is the idea of a bureacrat as the protaganist.<br />In most sci-fi stories the hero is a military person, or a brilliant scientist.  That's great, and there are many soldiers and scientists that read sci-fi, but I'd guess there are far more sci-fi readers that have paperwork-intensive desk jobs, organizing meetings or creating reports.  Carmichael's ordinariness creates a connection with the typical reader that is not found in many books.<br />McDevitt wrote an outstanding book.  This is great stuff, and you should read it if you get a chance.	2004-05-10

Like the other reviewers, I'm finding myself reading way ahead (I'm up to Valentine's Day already!).<br />My favorite stuff so far has been the digital camera articles, and the online searching information.  I've been a PC Magazine reader for years, and the book totally captures the PC Magazine style - smart, helpful, and exactly what I need.<br />The biggest surprise when I got the book was that it comes with a free year's subscription to PC Magazine.  Very cool!	2003-10-09

Now it's here and it's proving to be worth the wait.  What I need to figure out now is,  how can I make the designers of every software program I'll ever use read this book?<br />Hats off to Cooper and Reimann.  You would think that their axioms are common sense, like &quot;Never scroll text horizontally&quot;, or &quot;If it's worth the user entering, it's worth the program remembering&quot;.  But if those common sense ideas were actually common, why is there so much horrid software out there?	2003-03-31

But this time the smaller battles throughout the book were too far apart, and somehow not as detailed as usual.<br />Compared against other books in the genre this one earns five stars, but against the other Drizzt books it's a four-star read.  Very fun, but not the author's best work.	2002-09-12

It's a great twist on the classic story, with the pig as the bad guy this time.<br />The end of the story has the potential to be a sappy, sugary, group hug moment, but the author shows enough restraint to keep cynical adults from gagging.<br />The illustrations are wonderful.  Grab the book, it's a blast!	2002-09-12

It's a shame the publisher doesn't provide sample pages for Amazon to post.  You really need to sample this book to know if you'll love it or hate it.  If you like silly, cynical humor, you'll probably love the book.	2002-07-03
