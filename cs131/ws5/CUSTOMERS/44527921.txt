US	44527921	R331BFJM9051AT	0195173384	535906118	The New American Militarism: How Americans Are Seduced by War	Books	4	14	24	N	Y	History of America's militarism	It was analyst Robert Kagan who rose to prominence by making the argument that Americans have an increased tendency to resort to force to resolve their international predicaments; but it is \\"The New American Militarism,\\" by Andrew Bacevich, which looks at the intellectual and political construct that has propagated this mentality. <br /> <br />This book resembles the style of Mr. Bacevich's \\"American Empire.\\" In both, Mr. Bacevich takes up a theme that is publicly controversial and intuitively simple to explain and analyzes it in extreme depth. In doing so, Mr. Bacevich highlights certain trends that are so endemic that they are hardly studied-particularly how the idea that military force is central to foreign policy is a recent phenomenon, whose birth can be traced to the aftermath of the Vietnam War.  <br /> <br />But while deserving credit for narrating this important history, there are times when the book falls short; and nowhere is that more evident than in his usage of stylistic writing (usually a nice quotation) to substitute for analysis.  <br /> <br />In the introduction, Mr. Bacevich gives us a wonderful quote by Madison about the impact of war on \\"public liberty,\\" a theme that is last touched upon there. Elsewhere, he writes: \\"the possession of military might without precedent has in practice yielded a heightened sense of vulnerability,\\" again a topic that is hardly touched upon. Even in his conclusion, he quotes H. L. Mencken: \\"there is always a well-known solution to every human problem-neat, plausible, and wrong.\\" That's nice rhetoric, but Mr. Bacevich leaves it upon the reader to think about how war is the wrong instrument to pursue foreign policy, perhaps relying on the Iraq War as the obvious companion to this book and a substitute for including his thinking on it into it. <br /> <br />All the same, these are not complains about the book itself as much as they are about what the book could have been. In what it does-chronicle the rise of the new American militarism, it is splendid. But it shies away from wider questions-how does using military power impact America's own outlook of the world; what effects does it have on America's own society. Even his prescriptions are no strong point-they seem to have been placed they are a \\"must-have\\" for any such book. <br /> <br />In other words, this is a serious book that explains the rise of the new American militarism. But it is not a study of military America, nor a study of how a military foreign policy can be counterproductive. Although these themes are evident throughout, it is only in the surface that they could have helped produce a superior book.	2005-09-09

Last year, Steve Coll was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his book \\"Ghost Wars,\\" a twenty-year history of America in Afghanistan.  But save the exception of Taliban published by Ahmed Rashid, Afghanistan was consistently conspicuously absent from the Western booklist. <br /> <br />When Robert Kaplan first published this book, in 1990, he meant to shed light into a war whose geopolitical importance was inversely related to its attention in the press. \\"Soldiers of God\\" is a typical Kaplan book that interweaves the author's first-hand account of the region with a deep interest in understanding its history and a solemn sense of realism that pervades the narrative. <br /> <br />In telling his story, Mr. Kaplan begins with an introductory chapter on the war's barbarity-particularly the impact that Soviet mines had on the war and the country's landscape. He then looks at Peshawar, the Pakistani city that acted as the war's staging room, at least for the mujahedin side, before examining the tribal dynamics of the war, and specifically the Pathans' men relationship to their women. <br /> <br />It is in chapter 3 that Mr. Kaplan makes his trip into Afghanistan and gives a first-hand account of the Khyber Pass that connects Pakistan to Afghanistan; from then on, the reader gets an intimate and intricate image of the war's first line of attack, just as the portraits of the mujahedin get enriched with more detail and precision. <br /> <br />The greater image that emerges is how America let the Pakistani intelligence services, the ISI, run this war and how this jeopardized the subordination of American interests to Pakistan's own geopolitical priorities. Mr. Kaplan is very somber about this: \\"In the end, the mujahidin's willingness to suffer to a nearly unimaginable degree eventually overcame, andthus masked, the awful mistakes of American and Pakistani policy makers.\\" <br /> <br />The revised edition includes a new chapter, \\"The Lawless Frontier\\" which marks Kaplan's return to the region (in the spring of 2000), and which narrates the way that Pakistan promoted the Taliban as a substitute for Gulbuddin Heykmatyar's inability to consolidate his power in Afghanistan and thus serve Pakistan's interests. <br /> <br />If there is an easy way to explain this complex dynamic between Afghans, Pakistanis and Americans, \\"Soldiers of God\\" is it. But in the end, Mr. Kaplan would shy away from any grandiose statements; \\"For American policy makers, there may be no reliably applicable lessons of the Afghan war except that you win some and you lose some,\\" he writes. A sad conclusion to a war that cost 1.3 million lives.	2005-09-04

It is a world that is as exciting as it is dangerous-a perennial clash between the desire to place under control and the reality that the open seas are simply too vast to be governed. <br /> <br />William Langewiesche, writer for the Atlantic, looks at the various aspects of the shipping industry and chronicles its main characteristics and hazards. He writes about old ships that pass lax inspections and end up in accidents that damage the environment or kill people; he narrates the hazards of traversing though waters mired with pirates; and he even discusses the end-point of many ships, as they sold for scrap, usually in South Asia.  <br /> <br />Throughout this story comes the dialectic between the chaos of the sea and the attempts by governments to bring the whole edifice under control. Characteristically, he tells of the various efforts and fears of the US Coast Guard about the potential of a terrorist attack carried out through a merchant ship-a likelihood that is much feared but almost impossible to protect against. <br /> <br />In the end comes a balanced account of the realities of the sea. Save one narrative that is slightly overdrawn, the story is poised and well-focused, though at times it could have used more background and analysis instead of storytelling. But the underlying theme-that the chaos of the sea is unlikely to managed, comes across as powerfully as it could.	2005-09-03

It is no surprise then that this book is special too. Co authored by Mr. Levitt and Stephen Dubner, a journalist, Freakonomics is meant to summarize Mr. Levitt's professional career. The result is a valuable book which combines an insight into how economists think (if not what they usually think of) with an immense curiosity about the world.  <br /> <br />For practical purposes, the book could have been titled, \\"Give me data, data, data.\\" It wouldn't have sold much by that name, but it would have aptly described how the book is organized. To begin with, there is the research question, usually springing from intelligent curiosity; then comes the research design-a process, that is, that will answer the question; finally, there is data-the numbers meant to support or reject the research hypothesis.  <br /> <br />In that sense, \\"Freakonomics\\" is a useful tool for economists and non-economists alike. Although most of the results come from econometric analyses, the way that Mr. Levitt thinks about the world will appeal to the layman and expert alike. It's an easy read that will likely answer some questions, raise others, but most importantly help the reader understand how numbers can be used to answer the oddest questions ever.	2005-07-06

But the book covers much more ground, dealing with the relevance of realist thought in today's world and debunking some of the standard thought processes that dominate foreign policy discussions in the West. <br /> <br />Kaplan has lived and reported from the world's most wretched places-no wonder that this perspective is hardly accommodating to grandiose statements of the victory of liberalism or the need to conduct a moral foreign policy. Rather, his travels have hardened him and have thought him two things: that what the press writes about is not necessarily what should be in the news; and that the passion for morality and democracy can be counterproductive and dangerous.  <br /> <br />On the first thought, Kaplan is keenly aware that headlines are hardly representative of the big changes that will affect our world-how we cope with the physical environment, how human beings crave for conflict, how shifting power relations impact world politics. His close reading of classical texts (Kissinger's \\"A World Restored\\" is prominent in the book) shows that he is not the type of journalist who comes across something and writes about it. Rather his travels form an impetus for thought and research-and this makes his articles all the more exciting and insightful. <br /> <br />His second thought is to dispute the passionate love that Western policymakers have for democracy and peace. A peaceful world would be one without conflict-where the basic questions that give rise to disputes would be resolved; but this might not be a good world, Kaplan warns. He is also follows steadily in the realist tradition that distinguishes between the pursuit of a moral foreign policy and the achievement of one-the latter often comes when policymakers are least in quest of morality. <br /> <br />What emerges from the collection is a strong realist sense that is sharply at odds with contemporary debates. But Kaplan's voice is informed and temperate, and his caution has been bred in the world's hardest places and so deserves to be heard, and heard.	2005-06-16

Reid writes to alert America to a geopolitical revolution: the unification of Europe-a tectonic change that will change the world forever and that Americans have failed either to notice or fully ascertain. Waking America to the waking giant across the Atlantic is what this book is about. <br /> <br />As a history of Europe's unification this book is invaluable-it explains neatly and succinctly the move to integrate the continent, how and why it came about. It also captures the emerging economic power of the EU, and encapsulates the feeling of constructing Europe as an alternative to America; in doing so, Mr. Reid illustrates the political and social connections which bind the continent together and which separate it from America (Europe's welfare state, its aversion to large militaries and war, etc.) The book even contains a concise guide to the European Union, its member states and its institutional structures (this will surely excite even Europeans who are usually dumbfounded by Brussels and its complexities).  <br /> <br />For those who either don't know enough about the EU or think it is okay to not know enough about the EU, Mr. Reid offers a sober history and counterargument. All the same, there are reasons to be a bit skeptical about the overall narrative. For one, Mr. Reid is overly enthusiastic about the emergence of a pan-European consciousness. Generation E might all watch Eurovision and the Champions' League, and might travel cheaply with Euro-rail, but Europe still lacks a demos-a political consciousness and dialogue that is so vital to a collective political entity.  <br /> <br />Historically, Mr. Reid tries to reconcile two competing narratives. For one, he depends for his story on an exciting and inviting public-a public grew weary of war and tired of antagonisms. Whether that exists today or existed in the 1950s is questionable, though the post-war generation probably did feel a growing urgency of putting the past behind them. But this trend iscountered by the fact that the EU progressed all too slowly-that the first steps were hesitant and often imposed on a skeptical or reluctant public. The standard narrative of the EU is that of technocrats, bureaucrats and politicians leading a skeptical public-that is echoed in arguments against referenda that depend on a \\"if the past treaties were subjected to referenda, then there would be no EU\\" syllogism. This version of the EU, of \\"decaffeinated politics\\" as the Daily Telegraph columnist Noel Malcolm put it, puts leaders at a disconnected plain from voters-and this story rings much truer of life in the EU than Mr. Reid's does. <br /> <br />If Generation E is one of the book's shortcomings, then its economic analysis is another. Moot expressions such as a \\"stronger euro\\" are meaningless in the economist's ears. Although there is something to be said about the usage of the dollar as a reserve currency, the overall treatment of the topic is too short to be meaningful. And although Mr. Reid catalogues scores of European corporations succeeding in America, there is a similar story to be said about American companies abroad.  <br /> <br />In all, Mr. Reid's contribution will be to alert the American public about a grand change taking place in Europe. But in some areas, particularly on the public's connection to Brussels, on Europe's passion for technocratic and grand solutions to grand problems, and about its insistence on unity as the most potent goal, readers should do well to discount Mr. Reid's enthusiasm a bit, to get a more accurate picture of where Europe stands and where it might be headed.	2005-01-31
US	44527921	R3QXYLB5M8ZGNS	1400054753	987870891	Tower of Babble: How the United Nations Has Fueled Global Chaos	Books	4	52	56	N	N	Unequivocal condemnation	\\"The UN is protected by a very high wall of political correctness,\\" writes Dore Gold, \\"that makes criticism of it tantamount to an attack on all of mankind. But it is high time to recognize that it has utterly failed to achieve its founders' goals: to halt aggression and assure world order.\\" This is the conclusion that Mr. Gold, author of \\"Hatred's Kingdom\\" and Israeli Ambassador the UN from 1997 to 1999, reaches after examining the UN's record.  <br /> <br />Mr. Gold's grand narrative of failure begins in the beginning and ends in the end. His indictment of the United Nations comes even before the Cold War supposedly paralyzed it (the initial tests, writes Mr. Gold, were the first Arab-Israeli War and the first war between India and Pakistan over Kashmir) and lasts until the UN's failure to deal with Saddam Hussein, terrorism and WMD. In between are failures to deal with aggression, either across states or within them. <br /> <br />What is refreshing is that Mr. Gold has refrained from simply barraging the UN with its failures. Rather, he has identified certain trends that explain why the UN fails either when expressing the collective will of its members or when acting with its own mind. For Mr. Gold, the primary failure of the UN is its lost moral clarity; the UN founding fathers set up a system where evil existed and ought to be resisted. From the beginning, however, this clarity subsided-there are no aggressors and victims for the UN, writes Mr. Gold, just \\"warring parties\\"; and there is no cause and effect, just a \\"cycles of violence.\\" This happens to avoid compromising the UN's most cherished ideal: impartiality. Even if it means standing idle to aggression, standing by evil.  <br /> <br />In extremis, this lost moral clarity leads to moral equivalence-refusing to acknowledge that some party to a war might be more at fault than others, refraining from condemning outright violence, and seeking nonsensical explanations to justify armed struggle and even terrorism. This is tied to the proliferation of UN states that do not share the Western respect for democracy and human rights. As long as the UN reflects the aggregate of so many dictatorships, it is inevitable that it will lack either the political will or the political clout to punish those states with deviant behavior; \\"ultimately,\\" writes Mr. Gold, \\"the UN's biggest problem is that it no longer establishes any firm standards of behavior for UN member states.\\" The result, to name the most extreme example, is countries like Libya and Sudan being on the Human Rights Commission.  <br /> <br />If this is the failure of the UN as a collective body, then unaccountability is the failure of the UN as an organization. That Kofi Annan, head of UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations during Rwanda and Srebrenica, was promoted to Secretary-General is only the most obvious evidence of an organization unwilling to punish its staff. This evidence, Mr. Gold continues, runs off to the accusations made against UN peacekeepers in Cambodia, East Timor, Mozambique, Bosnia, Ethiopia and Eritrea for their unethical and often egregious behavior, to say nothing of the oil-for-food program that the UN administered in Iraq. Mr. Gold's summation is reflected in Sweden's Per Ahlmark remark that the UN has become \\"an institution in which no shortcoming, it seems, goes unrewarded.\\" <br /> <br />In all, Mr. Gold's unequivocal condemnation is a welcome break from the constant adulation and non-critical glorification that the UN receives in many countries across the world. At the same time, it not clear how and whether Mr. Gold's alternative, a community of democracies that is united by values and purpose, would operate. His coalition to fight terrorism, for example, would include Turkey, a notorious human rights abuser. And it is not clear for how long this democratic alliance would sustain converging views on who is the aggressor and who is the victim without resorting to the instinctive reaction of trying to mend fences rather than point fingers of blame. All the same, if there is a case to be made against the United Nations as it exists today, then that case is well contained in the \\"Tower of Babble.\\"	2005-01-31
US	44527921	R12LUG1KNYUZDO	0195167732	921274045	Hating America: A History	Books	5	27	30	N	Y	The chronicle of a timeless obsession	It was the humorist Art Buchwald who captured, in 1957, the American predicament; following a survey on what made people dislike America, he concluded: \\"If Americans would stop spending money, talking loudly in public places, telling the British who won the war, adopt a pro-colonial policy, back future British expeditions to Suez, stop taking oil out of the Middle East, stop chewing gum, ... move their bases out of England, settle the desegregation problem in the South ... put the American woman in her proper place, and not export Rock n' Roll, and speak correct English, the tension between the two countries might ease.\\" <br /> <br />Barry Rubin and Judith Colp Rubin have written an excellent book on what appears to be a timeless obsession -- hating America. What emerges most strongly from their narrative is not only how constant the hatred for America has been, but rather how adaptive -- tailored on an America that was emerging and marginal, to growing and influential, to powerful and omnipresent. This mutating anti-Americanism, always new and always old, has been passed down from the birth of the republic to the present day. <br /> <br />The early forms of anti-Americanism, the Rubins write, revolved around the European belief that the North American habitat was unwelcoming to civilization, producing inferior animals and inferior humans. While this took time to recede, the anti-American tide soon took issue with American manners, intellect, and social organization. Only in the twentieth century can there be a trace of hating America for what it does, rather than what it is; and even then, it is never fully convincing. <br /> <br />The themes that emerge most strongly from the book is how Europeans we born with a fear of America -- a fear that its democratic politics would infest their continent, a fear that its dynamic society would pose an alternative to their own, a fear that their people who be magnetized to the American sociopolitical and economic model at theexpense of the European one.  <br /> <br />If fear is one word that comes to mind when reading this book, impossibility is another -- the impossibility of Americans being loved. Much of the anti-American sentiment in France and the Soviet Union was hardly affected by America's assistance to those countries in World War II. America has been dubbed as infidel and fundamentalist, isolationist and omnipotent, navely optimistic and crudely calculating. Time and again, America has been charged with things it did not do or for things that others were more guilty of. Why has there been no enduring anti-Britishism, anti-Frenchism, anti-Russianism, or anti-Germanism? <br /> <br />The answer to this question lies as much with the nature of the American experiment and the character of its society as with anything America does in the world. What people dislike about America is what is good about it, rather than what is bad: its optimism, dynamism, practicality, diversity, tolerance. If this is so, then the American hopes for reversing this age-old obsession seem futile. For however the intensity of anti-Americanism in some places varies with American actions, its underlying appeal is timeless -- the product of political forces who fear America, what it stands for, and what it might mean for them.	2005-01-07
US	44527921	R1UJCAOY2IXQF8	0679720197	551664662	The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Five centuries, one narrative	It is unfortunate that this book's claim to fame has rested largely on its diagnosis of America's \\"imperial overstretch\\" and its prognosis of American decline, for the author writes repeatedly that this is not an exercise in political science, but in history. Instead, Paul Kennedy has tried to put together a sweeping history of the Great Powers from 1500 to 2000, and, only secondarily, to speculate on how the continuation of some broad historical trends might play out in the future. <br /> <br />The narrative takes off with the Habsburg bid for European hegemony, then traces the European balance of power that was ultimately upset by Napoleon's similar bid in the early nineteenth century, through the Congress of Vienna and the relative peace leading up to the unification of Germany, all the way to the two world wars and the cold war, only to end with a chapter on what the future might hold. <br /> <br />Brining all these historical events together is one of the book's prime assets, as is its ability to separate fact from analysis (though, it is written for people with definite knowledge of history). Devoting equal attention to politics, economics, geography, and technology is another, though the later chapters (on contemporary affairs) might suffer a bit on the economics side, especially on treating financial strength in a somewhat outdated form.  <br /> <br />What stands out in the work, however, is its broader themes-how growth rates affect the pattern of international politics; Kennedy spends enough time to deal with countries specifically and analyze how they have coped with the various developments, internal and external, that have come their way. His general theory of overstretch-of a gap between a country's grand strategy and the resources it commits to bring it about-is particularly interesting to read (even if overstretch is easier to identify in hindsight than to specify when occurring).  <br /> <br />Overall, there are few books there that can master an equal command of historical fact, global trends, and penetrating insight into such a wide range of human history and historiography. For that alone, \\"The Rise and Falls of the Great Powers,\\" deserves to be read, and read.	2005-01-05

Thankfully, Martin Wolf is no such person. <br /> <br />With this book, Mr. Wolf, of the Financial Times, shows he is part of an elite group of economists who have both the talent and the taste to write for the public at large-a list that would probably include few others than Jagdish Bhagwati and Paul Krugman from academia, and Clive Crook and John Kay from journalism. Mr. Wolf has a natural instinct for economic theory, a commanding knowledge of technical economic writing, and a synthetic genius to bring it all together in a comprehensive and accessible form.  <br /> <br />The book has many attractions, among them that Mr. Wolf takes no prisoners. From the outset, he shows he wants to deal with every serious (and some less serious) charge that is levied against international economic integration. But what is really refreshing is that Mr. Wolf remains committed to restating, in simple and unequivocal terms, the merits of globalization-starting from its liberal premise as a system where people can make free choices. The interconnectedness of economic and political freedom is expounded not merely on its empirical base, but also on its intellectual-that both are systems that rely heavily on individual decision-making and responsibility.  <br /> <br />What is most refreshing of all is that Mr. Wolf remains committed to the liberal case for globalization-avoiding such political ploys as \\"globalization is inevitable,\\" a theme taken up by many politicians and pundits. He also refuses to acknowledge complains when none are justified or when they are grossly exaggerated. This isn't to say that Mr. Wolf is a non-critical enthusiast for globalization-rather it means that his criticisms are justified and specific, and most of all, backed by specific evidence.  <br /> <br />What comes out of the book is a thoughtful evaluation of where globalization is headed, and what is needed to manage it better. But whatever the specific adjustments that Mr. Wolf calls for in this book, it is the broader theme that should be taken to heart-that the world needs more globalization, not less.	2004-12-22

All the same, it is also impossible not to cast a doubt on the book's main conclusion-that the US-led coup in Iran in 1953 lies at the root of Middle East terror. <br /> <br />Stephen Kinzer, a veteran reporter for the New York Times, is no stranger to American coups, having contributed to the writing of the history of the CIA coup in Guatemala in 1954. In \\"All the Shah's Men,\\" Mr. Kinzer chronicles another coup, one that preceded Guatemala and laid the foundation for America's thinking that coups can be a useful and effective tool of foreign policy. <br /> <br />The book narrates the history of foreign involvement in Iran that culminated in the toppling of Mossadegh Mohammad and the re-coronation of Reza Shah as Iran's leader. Mr. Kinzer goes back centuries to choreograph the details of foreign involvement in Iranian politics, and pays particular attention to the last century and a half: in 1872, for example, Nasir al-Din Shah offered a most sweeping concession to Baron Julius de Reuter to, among others, exploit Iran's natural resources, a privilege revoked a year later. After that came other concessions, extended and then revoked, agreed and then renegotiated, on oil and other business.  <br /> <br />What made the landscape explosive was the resignation, in 1941, of Reza Shah, Iran's king, and the subsequent emergence of Mossadegh, and a person who rested much of his political fortune on the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Corporation (in 1951). His passionate belief that his country had been exploited by the British, and his unwillingness to compromise, coupled with the intransigence of the British created a perfect setting for confrontation.  <br /> <br />Perfect, yes. But not inevitable. For that, one has to credit the re-election of Winston Churchill, an ardent Empire enthusiast, who was much keener on resolving the dispute between Iran and the AIOC, by force if necessary, than was his predecessor. Equally important was the election of Dwight Eisenhower, who replaced the skeptical and sympathetic to Iran Harry Truman, and adopted a more assertive pro-British line (courtesy of the Dulles brothers, Allen and John Foster, who ran the CIA and State Department, and who feared Iran might turn communist).  <br /> <br />The narrative is eloquent, with enough attention on detail as to offer a vivid account of what happened and why. Mr. Kinzer has an eye for drama, building up the sequence of events with a novel-like quality (including the details of the coup, and Mossadegh's visit to the USA and UN). No doubt, the reader will feel rather conversant on the details of the foreign involvement in Iran leading up to the 1953 coup.  <br /> <br />What is less obvious, however, is Mr. Kinzer grand conclusion: \\"It is not far-fetched,\\" he writes, \\"to draw a line from Operation Ajax [the coup codename] through the Shah's repressive regime and the Islamic Revolution to the fireballs that engulfed the World Trade Center in New York.\\" As a history book, \\"All the Shah's\\" has many attractions; and, no doubt, there are lessons in 1953 to be learned today about meddling in other countries' businesses. But to link the 1953 with September 11 feels more like authoring overstretched, and should be best left at that.	2004-12-08

Collectively, these forty-two essays chronicle the evolution of American foreign policy-its intellectual and political struggle to deal with the world since 1922. This compilation is divided into decades-1930s, 1940s, and so on, each dealing with the dominant themes of that decade, ranging from the founding of Foreign Affairs in 1922 to its 75th anniversary in 1997.  <br /> <br />Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of essays: on one hand are those essays for which the reader will have a historical interest-as a snapshot of contemporary debates; on the other, there are essays which probe timeless themes and their ideas can be as applicable today as they were when they were first written. What is most exciting is when essays combine the two-capturing the essence of past debates while developing timeless themes and arguments for posterity to refer to. It is in these cases that \\"Foreign Affairs\\" is at its best.  <br /> <br />It is impossible, for example, to read Fouad Ajami's \\"The end of Pan-Arabism\\" without feeling that you're getting a deeper understanding of the Middle East, one that is as necessary today as it was when it was written in 1978. Or, to read David Fromkin's \\"Strategies of Terrorism,\\" without drawing parallels with Al-Qaeda and the United States and their own battle against each other. Or to read Richard Cooper propose a world currency without thinking how many of the problems we face today were anticipated back in the 1980s. Or Julien Brenda counter the case the pacifism and democracy go hand in hand, without thinking how the two ideas have been so connected in our minds today. Or, reading Hans Morgenthau discuss intervention and non-intervention in Viet Nam without drawing lessons about America's contemporary strategic debate which revolves around the same questions.  <br /> <br />Inevitably, every reader's list of favorites will vary-the anthology, after all,is so diverse as to placate everyone's appetite. There are essays on war and peace, international economics, development, terrorism, nationalism, isolationism, containment, imperialism, human rights, and technology; and there are more specific ones that deal with the interwar period, the Cold War, the war in Viet Nam, decolonization in Africa, on the Middle East in the 1970s, on American foreign policy, on the Soviet Union in the 1980s, and on the war in the former Yugoslavia.  <br /> <br />The authors too are drawn from all specters of political debates. They include such theoretical legends as Hans Morgenthau and Samuel Huntington; key political players as Henry Kissinger, George F. Kennan, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Nikolai Bukharin; economists as Paul Krugman and Richard Cooper; journalists as Walter Lippmann, Irving Kristol, and Hamilton Fish Armstrong; and others as Fouad Ajami, David Fromkin, Isaiah Berlin, W.E.B. Du Bois, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Aleksandr Solzhenistym, and others.  <br /> <br />As a primary source, but also a reference on what some of the brightest minds of the century had to say on the important issues of the day, \\"The American Encounter\\" cannot be absent from the library of anyone who is serious about understanding the international politics of the twentieth century.	2004-11-19

For what Azar Nafisi does in this memoir is look into the psyche of the Iranian revolution-what fed it, what it stood for, how it evolved-through the lens of great books of literature. <br /> <br />The book is composed of several dynamics-one is the powerful and omnipresent love for literature and books, a love which is evidence of the ability to empathize with others, of the shrewdness to analyze characters and all their complexity, and of the capacity to let imagination and reality mingle and create a space where the dreams of books and the harshness of a revolution can coexist, interact, but not get into each other's way. <br /> <br />The second is a current of liberalism that clashes with the conservative character of the revolution, which disdains challenges and fears inquisition and interrogation. The clash between the inquisitive and the fearful-between those willing to navigate into intellectually uncharted waters and those for whom those waters best remain uncharted-becomes not only evident but a defining feature of the book. The reader's frustration with the obtuseness of many of the revolution's advocates is a recurring feeling.  <br /> <br />Last is the human element which puts this wider struggle of ideas and power in Iran in another perspective; the desire to live peacefully, to flirt freely, to dress provocatively, to love passionately are all in some way suppressed by the regime's desire to control its subjects lives. It is no different, Ms. Nafisi tells us, than Nabokov's Humbert trying to take possession of Lolita's life; or of Gatsby's perilous pursuit of his dream. <br /> <br />Ms. Nafisi has opened a literary window into the Iranian revolution, one that looks past the geopolitical forces which gave rise to the revolt in the first place, but one that probes deeply into the anxieties, dreams, and disappointments of this theocratic experiment. All the better that she does so with eloquence, and while relating her experience to great novels, giving her book a refreshing and original narrating context.	2004-09-28

The history of the past seventy years is narrated through the life of authors and their works-what they wrote, how the societies around them reacted, and how the political condition merged with their literary expression, only to suppress it and silence it.  <br /> <br />As a parallel history, \\"The Dream Palace of the Arabs\\" could accompany any book. But in looking at the literary interplay between modernizing authors and their surroundings, Mr. Ajami has not only dug deeper in his probe of what brought about the present Arab political condition, but has analyzed the issue on a whole other level.  <br /> <br />The reader who is familiar with Middle Eastern history will not feel burdened by the material. The refreshing tone and approach allows Mr. Ajami to deal with such issues as the Iranian revolution, the Egyptian peace with Israel, the Palestinian battle with Israel, or the Iran-Iraq with refreshing erudition and acumen that always excites and never bores.  <br /> <br />\\"The Dream Palace of the Arabs\\" cannot serve as an introduction to the Middle East; it is too subtle and perceptive for that; but for anyone who is tired of reading about oil politics, religious fundamentalism and elusive peace deals, and who is actually interested in the underlying intellectual currents upon which the Arab political storm thrives, \\"The Dream Palace of the Arabs\\" is a sure bet.	2004-09-28

It is obviously different from past empires because it is hardly territorial; but it still exerts its influence in ways that Rome or Britain would have found unimaginable. On another other axis rests the issue of the impact of the American imperium: is it a force for peace and stability or upheaval and destruction? Then, there is an issue of strategy: how should American policymakers conduct their affairs? What should citizens do? <br /> <br />These are some of the questions addressed in \\"The Imperial Tense,\\" a book edited by Andrew Bacevich, a professor of International Relations at Boston University. Mr. Bacevich is no stranger to empire. His book, American Empire, was widely acclaimed; its central argument was that, however in denial, America's commitment to empire is not only real but also a central component of its foreign policy. He now brings that expertise in collecting some of the finest perspectives on the problems and prospects of the American Empire.  <br /> <br />The selections are diverse just as they insightful; David Rieff carves out the problems of humanitarian intervention; Deepek Lal writes to defend Empires; Charles Krauthammer praises America's unipolar era; David North admonishes America's drive for world domination; Peter Bender, Andrew Bacevich, Jedediah Purdy, David Marquand, James Chance, Martin Walker, Victor Davis Hanson all explore America's position as a unique empire; Josh Milblank, Stanley Hoffman, G. John Ikenberry, Charles Maier, Stephen Peter Rosen debate America's imperial strategies; and Wendell Berry, Gabriel Ash and James Kurth speculate on America's future.  <br /> <br />Not all the pieces are great; but they are widely representative of the breadth and depth of the debate taking place about America's role as a global empire. Although the authors aremostly American, this hardly diminishes those parts of the book which cast a skeptical eye on the imperial enterprise. In the end, \\"The Imperial Tense\\" is one of the best books to bring together some of the most thoughtful articles on the American imperium. For that, and for its reference value, it is sure to be widely read and used.	2004-09-25

Hence the tone of the work is largely academic, with plenty of references to academic debates and literature reviews. All the same, the text is accessible and hardly ever esoteric; the academic density is likely to add to rather than subtract from the enjoyment of reading the book.  <br /> <br />What of the thesis itself? Mr. Zakaria approaches his period of examination from two alternative angles, both of which are used in the international relations literature to explain why nations expand: realism and defensive realism. The former places emphasis on why and when states choose to expand by focusing on an innate drive to power, tempered by practicability and opportunity; the latter maintains that states expand when they are faced with threats. <br /> <br />Mr. Zakaria, it turns out, is content with neither of the two propositions. What best explains this period of American foreign policy, he contends, is a variation of realism: state-centered realism (SCR). The important qualification of SCR is that it accounts for power conversion-the ability of the state apparatus to convert national resources into stated government objectives. This approach, Mr. Zakaria continues, applies to the American case because although the American nation was strong from 1865 to 1908, only when the state and its bureaucracy were streamlined was America able to pursue an ambitious foreign policy (from 1890 onward). <br /> <br />The thesis is elegant, the argument tightly argued, and the prose clear and concise. Occasionally, Mr. Zakaria attacks defensive realism by refuting arguments that some defensive realists would rarely make; but this is rare and cannot distract from the convincingness of the his overall thesis: that it was the rise of the American state that helped America convert its vast national wealth into international influence. Anyone seeking to understand that period of American foreign policy, or the overall theoretical question, can hardly do better than read \\"From Wealth to Power.\\"	2004-08-30

This strategy, Mr. Brzezinski maintains, has the added benefit of addressing both the sources of global instability as well as the potential power struggles in Europe and East Asia. His geopolitical mind runs much farther than the global Balkans and onto the future of the transatlantic partnership and the rise of China.  <br /> <br />Although, Mr. Brzezinski tries to address contemporary debates, it is clear that his thinking looks much more into the future, into the potential geopolitical developments of this century. As a strategic vision, \\"The Choice\\" has the attractions of looking far ahead, while remaining well-tuned to the realities of the day.  <br /> <br />At the same time, the book suffers from its brevity and scope-it is not rare for the reader to demand more depth and precision. Still, as a contribution to the broad strategic debate on the balance between leadership and domination, \\"The Choice\\" offers penetrating insights that policymakers can ignore only at their peril.	2004-08-27

Instead, Mr. Ferguson takes on a more modest thesis: that Britain made the modern world. <br /> <br />As ambitious as this sounds, Mr. Ferguson is careful in his formulation: for much, though not all, of its history, the British Empire \\"acted as an agency for imposing free markets, the rule of law, investor protection and relatively incorrupt governments on roughly a quarter of the globe.\\" It did so by exporting certain features of its society (English language, common law, respect for liberty, banking, representative assemblies, and others) that underwrote and fuelled the most significant period of globalization (or Anglobalization) that the world had experienced to date.  <br /> <br />From this bold thesis comes a tightly argued and narrated history of the British Empire. In the process of the argument, Mr. Ferguson tackles certain conventional hypothesis (for example, he disagrees that the British Empire was set up in an absence of mind) and covers the basic components of the Empire by examining the roles of pirates, planters, missionaries, mandarins, bankers and bankrupts. <br /> <br />The end product is an elegant history that escapes the narrow debate between costs and benefits in evaluating the impact of the British Empire; in fact, Mr. Ferguson's contribution would lie much to the fact that he has changed the axes for judgment rather than supporting one or another position. And his underlying position, than in the absence of British rule, our world would be much different (and probably worse) will strike many as rather provocative if not presumptuous. But if there were ever a case to be made for that proposition, then it is nowhere better formulated than in the \\"Empire.\\"	2004-08-27

It is provocative and contains fresh insights; it navigates with considerable ease between history, politics, and economics; and it is extremely well written, illuminating succinctly the author's thoughts and engaging the reader's interest.<br />Mr. Ferguson, formerly of Oxford and now a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, writes to sketch out the reality of America's global position-to argue that, for all intents and purposes, America is an empire. Mr. Ferguson is not fundamentally opposed to empires-not because he likes foreign control but because he recognizes a benign type of liberal empire that can afford both the metropolis and periphery with benefits that independence cannot.<br />\\"Colossus\\" surveys various themes, beginning on whether America constitutes an empire (yes), then surveying America's ascent to its role as a global power, and finally gauging America's relation to multilateralism and its allies (American unilateralism, he argues, has more to do with the United Nations' overall failure to achieve certain objectives than with American instincts.)<br />But the real question is, what is the impact of this empire? Mr. Ferguson is enthusiastic about the prospect of a liberal empire, a position he bases on the record of decolonization; decolonization, he writes, was \\"an experiment to test the hypothesis that it was imperialism that caused both poverty and wars and that self-determination would ultimately pave the way to prosperity and peace. That hypothesis has been largely proven false.\\"<br />For all his eagerness for America to play its role and underwrite the current wave of globalization, Mr. Ferguson is skeptical about America's ability to be an effective liberal empire. Empires, he argues, need to go places, learn their histories, and expend the money, manpower, and attention to get the job done. America's celebrated examples of nation-building-Germany and Japan-took years to complete; and both countries still retain American troop presences. All this is in contrast with America's appetite for an exit strategy from Iraq and Afghanistan. <br />In other words, America should be a global leader, but is unlikely to be an effective one, unless it undergoes a profound metamorphosis of the way it views its imperial role. America's looming economic liabilities are also going to alter America's budgetary orientation, possibly affecting its position as a superpower. Whether Mr. Ferguson is right in his predictions remains to be seen; but \\"Colossus\\" will surely stand out as one of the most authoritative and comprehensive reviews of America's role as an imperial power.	2004-07-18

To his credit, Mr. Bhagwati has considered most of the subtleties, nuances and variations of the NGO arguments. <br />Having done this, Mr. Bhagwati explains whether and why the NGOs are wrong. Predictably, the NGO fears usually prove exaggerated or simply untrue. To their polemic rhetoric, Mr. Bhagwati answers with anecdotes, news reports and econometric studies. Whether one agrees or disagrees with him, no one can accuse Mr. Bhagwati of brushing aside the critics. <br />Refreshingly, the book is not an unconditional acceptance of globalization. \\"In Defense of Globalization\\" is a defense, but it is not blind to what is wrong about globalization; Mr. Bhagwati is cautious, for example, about uninhibited capital flows; he is also critical about the invasion of intellectual property rights into trade agreements; he is also suspicious of businesses that bribe politicians to alter trade agreements to their favor. And so on.<br />Yet, his verdict is staunchly pro-globalization. He urges against using trade-curtailing answers to economic problems; he also alerts us that many of the ills identified by NGOs have little to do with globalization (\\"What has globalization got to do with that?\\" he writes more than once). More importantly, he offers ideas about how to make globalization better, from managing immigration, to rethinking the trade sanctions, to the role that NGOs ought to play, and many more. Nothing here is new; but he assembles the various ideas that he has pronounced over the years in books, op-ed pieces and academic journals.<br />There is no doubt that \\"In defense of globalization\\" will be the book to beat from now on. No anti-globalization treatise should be published without being able to refute Mr. Bhagwati's arguments. For having elucidated this debate even further, Mr. Bhagwati deserves to be read and to be thanked.	2004-06-07

In doing so, she offered one of the most perverse exchanges ever on the issue of genocide: \\"we have every reason to believe that acts of genocide have occurred in Rwanda.\\" \\"What's the difference between acts of genocide and genocide?\\" asked a journalist. \\"Clearly not all of the killings that have taken place in Rwanda are killings to which you might apply that label\\"; \\"how many acts of genocide does it take to make genocide?\\" the journalist pressed; \\"that's not a question that I'm in a position to answer.\\"<br />This frustrating exchange, coming more than two months into a genocide that ultimately claimed 800,000 lives, is testament to the pervasive influence that the term genocide has acquired in the public mind. It is also evidence that the long efforts of Raphael Lemkin, who conjured up the concept of genocide in 1933, baptized it a decade later, and converted it into an international crime in 1948, had finally paid off. Lemkin had achieved part of what he dreamed: to create a word that would trigger the imagination and moral outrage necessary to cause good people to prevent such horrific acts of barbarity and inhumanity.<br />Samantha Power, of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, traces the history of genocide in the twentieth century by focusing on how America reacted to the genocides it had to confront in the past hundred years: that in Turkey against the Armenians, in Hitler's Germany, in Cambodia, in Iraq, in Rwanda, and the former Yugoslavia. The book, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2003, synthesizes an amazing array of information that together combine for the most authoritative review of the subject. Blending together her journalistic instinct for story-telling, her writer's gift for precision and concision, and her historian's eye, she produces a masterful account that navigates between the human tragedy of genocide and the cold political calculus of responding to it.<br />Her verdict is as indictable as her hope is refreshing. The failure to prevent genocide rests on a complex nexus that leads political reasoning to favor inaction. An inability to imagine how terribly human beings can act when fueled with hatred, a perverse belief that action will do little good, a political calculus that punishes commission more so than omission, and a supposed handicap in obtaining a clear picture of what is happening all conspire to allow American policymakers to rationalize inaction, even when faced with overwhelming evidence that their intervention is essential to save thousands or even millions.<br />But the story is not all depressing. From the Armenian genocide in 1915, policymakers have been willing to stand up and demand that their country act. Sadly, their appeals have been met with little excitement, and often they have proven professionally suicidal. Yet, there is certainly a learning curve; the fear of reliving \\"another Rwanda,\\" for example, has a powerful institutional influence that may prompt action in the future. What is certain is that if this wholesale tilt in American foreign policy is ever to become a reality, \\"A Problem from Hell\\" will have played a major role in bringing it about.	2004-06-04

One of the major themes is how anti-Western criticisms tend to have some elements of the West in them; another, is that many are driven by a distorted, confused or romanticized view of the past (or an alternative present). <br />Still, the book leaves something to be desired: to know that the death cult celebrated by Osama bin Laden has historical precedents in the Japanese Kamikaze or the Assassins of the eleven and twelfth centuries might not be as relevant as asking the question of how to overcome it. The authors turn to the question of \\"how to protect the idea of the West\\" in the conclusion, though the reader could have profited from a more lengthy treatment. All the same, \\"Occidentalism\\" sheds plenty light and adds historical context to some of the most important debates of the present.	2004-05-27

The product is an intellectual and historical tour de force, which dissects the American desire for security by looking at what its government did the last two times it was faced with a similar predicament: after the British burned the White House and Capitol Hill in 1814, and after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941.<br />The three dominant themes employed (or conceived) by John Quincy Adams were unilateralism, preemption, and hegemony. Roosevelt's reaction to Pearl Harbor, on the other hand, rested on multilateralism and a rejection of preemption; ironically, he still achieved the third: hegemony. The book then proceeds to carefully craft an analysis (and critique) between those two historical precedents and President Bush's reaction after September 11.<br />It is hard to imagine another book that can look so clearly and refreshingly at the major security issues confronting American foreign policy at the time; and to do so in so few pages. Nor is it imaginable that anyone could have summarized in a single paragraph his or her suggestion about what America foreign policy should be aimed at (no spoilers here: read the book).

This book, which tells of his efforts to disarm Iraq from 1991 to 2003, is likely to do the same. <br />The initial impression is twofold: that the intelligence presented to support the war was questionable; and that Mr. Blix was unlikely to lead the aggressive inspections that the American administration claimed were necessary to find Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Soon, however, there is much more of the first and less of the second.<br />To be sure, Mr. Blix is a civil servant and not a politician. As such he tries to avoid getting into political discussions; when he does turn political, he is clearly at his weakest. His various jabs, usually aimed at the American government, and his interjections often distract from the narrative and even invite readers to wonder how much his views have colored his professional work (not much is my take). <br />All the same, Mr. Blix gives a very balanced assessment of the pre-war intelligence. He admits that his gut feeling was that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction. But he argues that there was never any concrete evidence to support that hypothesis; and he goes point-by-point to the various facts claimed by the Americans, British, and his own team to substantiate his position.<br />In all, \\"Disarming Iraq\\" is neither an easy read nor burdensome. Much of the information in the book is in the public domain; yet the way that Mr. Blix has brought everything together, alongside with his commentary and perspective, is undoubtedly going to make \\"Disarming Iraq\\" an indispensable read on the war in Iraq.	2004-05-20

Yet this is precisely what \\"From Beirut to Jerusalem\\" does: it takes a very thorough and candid look at the recent history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a fair and balanced view. <br />Thomas Friedman, of the New York Times, narrates his almost decade-long adventure of reporting the Middle East, first in Beirut and then in Jerusalem. The product is an elegant and well-written book that combines his journalistic attention to precision, detail, and anecdotes with his historian's drive for proving context, perspective, and analysis. <br />\\"From Beirut to Jerusalem\\" contains a great deal of adventure (who says reporters can't live James Bond-like lives?). But in the end, what makes this a great book is its ability to tell the story of the Middle East in the 1980s, while dissecting the important political and historical forces that define the geopolitical environment of the conflict. Written for the layman and expert alike, this is surely one of the best books on the Middle East.	2004-05-18

Tracing the debates in the Bush Administration from day one until the war started, Bob Woodward narrates the well-known and widely reported facts leading up to the war supported by behind the scenes accounts that add another dimension to the story.<br />In a way, much of the story is familiar-the debates between the hawks and the doves, the diplomatic maneuvers in the United Nations, the intelligence reports on Iraq's weapons and links to terrorism. On that level, Mr. Woodward's contribution is to bring all the information together nicely. <br />But there is another layer-the interviews, the closed-door meetings, and the day-to-day preparations which give a good account of how this war was being planned; one of the major themes here is how the administration was more concerned about winning the war than winning the peace. <br />In all, \\"Plan of Attack\\" is probably the best story that can come out of this war at this point, given that the war is still being fought and everyone involved remains in office. But I suspect that this book will serve as a good narrative for those interested in the pre-war situation; it is also likely that it will be used twenty years' down the line as an authoritative historical record of the war planning.	2004-05-18

But the truth is more complicated than that; America's foreign policy towards Afghanistan during the 1980s and 1990s was always distant. In the 1980s, the policy was aimed at the attrition (and then expulsion) of the Soviet forces, by using the resources and cover of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). After that, America's policy slipped into mere indifference, that is, until September 11, 2001. <br />Tracing the evolution of America's engagement in Afghanistan from 1979 is the subject of Steven Coll's \\"Ghost Wars.\\" Mr. Coll, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist and managing editor of the Washington Post, has written a detailed and compelling narrative that weaves together decades' worth of interest in the region. The book is divided into three parts: first comes the period from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 until its withdrawal in 1989; second, the period after 1989 until January 1998, before the CIA first drafted plans to arrest and kill Osama bin Laden; and third, the period from January 1998 to September 10, 2001, which included al Qaeda attacks against the US in Kenya, Tanzania, and Yemen. <br />The end product is elegant, well written, and very informative. Written, obviously, for people who care about details, \\"Ghost Wars\\" has thorough narratives of the various relationships that defined America's engagement in the region: its bizarre and often hostile relationship with Pakistan's ISI, its connection with Saudi Arabia, and its various agreements with different fighters of the post-Soviet war. From this story, it becomes evident how and when bin Laden started to emerge as a powerful figure, what America tried to do about it, and how its efforts were frustrated by politics at home and abroad. <br />In all, \\"Ghost Wars\\" will fill many gaps by delving into more detail than other books on the topic. Written with a journalist's style, \\"Ghost Wars\\" refrains from grand analytical connections and broad themes that try to bring everything together. Still, Mr. Coll does insert some analysis at times, helping alleviate the burden of continuous story-telling. This sporadic analysis, combined with the excellent narrative, should place \\"Ghost Wars\\" on everyone's reading list on the war on terror.	2004-05-04

Gerald Posner, former Wall Street lawyer and now journalist, traces neatly the two predominant forces that defined the decade prior to September 11: the rise of Islamic terrorism and the failure of America's counter-terrorism efforts. <br />One of the book's strengths is that it summarizes much of the material found elsewhere; the book's brevity can also be seen as an asset. But the style is also a liability: some chapters are merely three to four pages long, others run to over 20 pages. This disproportionate emphasis on detail (too much detail somewhere, not enough elsewhere) distracts from the narrative and takes away from the book's continuity. The lack of a conclusion to summarize the book's various themes is also a bit frustrating.<br />All in all, the book is a good overview of what went wrong in America's counterterrorism efforts throughout the 1990s. All the same, \\"Why America Slept\\" is unlikely to add more than a few details to those with a solid background on the topic; and those who wish to develop a solid background will find that they need to read more after finishing this book.	2004-04-28

(All three are journalists; Mr. Miller is one of the few Westerners to have interviewed Osama bin Laden, an account of which we read in the book).<br />The book begins in 1990 and traces the evolution of US-targeted Islamic terrorism. Starting with the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane (founder of the Jewish Defense League), \\"The Cell\\" chronicles such events as the bombing of the World Trade Center, the attacks against the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the attack on the USS Cole, and September 11. <br />The narrative is fluid, indeed impressively so. Although the authors follow the lives of dozen terrorists and their activities, at no point does the reader feel lost. In fact, \\"The Cell\\" is probably as good an introduction as there is on those involved with September 11. What is also striking is the authors' tone: this book really feels like an answer to the question \\"why the FBI and CIA failed to stop the 9/11,\\" rather than, \\"who should we blame for September 11.\\" <br />In the end, the authors believe that America was just not alert enough to anticipate the threat. Inadequate coordination between the FBI, CIA, INS and others also played a big role, as did the fact that politics often undermined the work of intelligent officers. Unless these change, the authors warn, September 11 will not be the last terrorist attack that America suffers.	2004-04-10

For one, it gives a candid image of places such as the Middle East and Central Asia; Middle Eastern politics, for example, are defined by conspiracy theories and obscure links between different people and groups. Central Asia, on the other hand, is the epitome of no-man's land-a place where law and order simply do not exist. Anyone interested in those regions would get a very insightful account.<br />While the \\"travelogue\\" is appealing, what is more interesting is Mr. Baer's presentation of how the CIA works. What kind of training do CIA agents undergo? How do they get the information they need? What kind of challenges do they face? What are the political obstacles they face? To all these questions, Mr. Baer has answers.<br />But if there is a higher purpose in \\"See No Evil,\\" it is to reminisce about the good old days, when the CIA was left to do what it was supposed to: gather information to protect the United States. Political correctness and timid politicians have watered down the CIA's job, Mr. Baer complains, putting too much emphasis on satellites rather than human sources. Today, the CIA could just as well be named the \\"Central Itinerary Agency,\\" for sending people on vacations. <br />All this has destroyed America's intelligence capacity. As the enemies of America prepare to attack, the intelligence community and, by extension, the political authorities have no clue. Unless the CIA is re-invented to invest heavily in human sources rather than technology, Mr. Baer reminds us, the homeland will never be safe, whatever else America does.	2004-04-07

This rival ... is no other than the sun.\\"<br />Sarcasm, Robert Heilbroner tells us, is just one of many ways in which economists have tried to express their ideas and make them intelligible to a skeptical public. If Bastiat comes off as an eccentric, that is because he was. But wait till you meet others such as absent-minded Adam Smith or aspiring revolutionary Karl Marx. Only then will the world of economics become alive. <br />In this succinct volume, Mr. Heilbroner aims to make economics appealing to non-economists. There are no graphs, few numbers, and all ideas are conveyed in a superb way, paving the way for future inquiries (a rich bibliographical survey serves the same purpose). The book will also excite those with an economics background, as it offers anecdotes into people whom students usually know only academically. Still, the greatest contribution will be the introduction of the economics world to those who seem aloof to it, either because they find it boring or difficult. After reading this book, they should change their minds.	2004-04-02

Sadly, he has chosen to focus his energies on a very narrow field (how the IMF and the US Treasury Department handled the Asian Financial Crisis and Russia's transition from communism to capitalism) and write about it in a self-righteous tone, so much so that his message is often diluted. <br />All the same, Mr. Stiglitz raises some valid concerns, primarily about the narrow focus that plagues many Western economists, who favor some policies (particularly macroeconomics) while not paying attention to others (such as property rights and institutions). Mr. Stiglitz's caution against market fundamentalism should be taken seriously by those who wish to maintain a broader picture of globalization.<br />But in the end, Mr. Stiglitz's tone and bias undermine his own argument. From the outset, he makes clear that the world is occupied by concerned government leaders who care for their people and by IMF economists who care about statistics and financial interests while disregarding human concerns such as poverty and employment. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that the former were always more receptive to Mr. Stiglitz's arguments than were the latter. <br />When Mr. Stiglitz writes about economics, he is clearly at his prime. But maybe he should have waited a few years and produced a more balanced assessment of his years in the World Bank-then, we would have benefited more from the clarity of his thoughts rather than the opacity of his rage.	2004-02-16

For some, companies are the instruments of evil, they exist to profit at the expense of ordinary people, and their chief executives are defamed for their greed and ambition. All the same, most people live off the checks they receive from those evil beasts; and, being the CEO of a large company offers comparable prestige with other esteemed professions. <br />Wrestling with these competing images of corporations is part of what \\"The Company\\" aims at. John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, both of The Economist, embark on an ambitious project to show that the corporation lies at the heart and center of organized societies-more so than the state, the commune, the political party, the church, and others.<br />Having put modesty aside, the authors deliver on their promise with great skill, both literary and scholarly. All pervasive in their narrative is a deep sense of historical perspective-of contrasting the companies of today with those of the past. This need of putting the present in context is extremely valuable in canvassing the role that corporations (and particularly multinationals) play in the world today. <br />Several themes emerge in this historical journey. The first is the evolution of the company itself through a continuous political debate about its role and place in society. A second charts the different attitudes that societies have had towards companies; in particular the authors focus on the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan. <br />At the heart of this book is the dialectic between society and company; the Virginia Company, for example, effectively introduced democracy in America in 1619. This helps explains why Americans have been more receptive to companies that have other countries. This is one of countless examples in the book that chronicle the immense impact that companies have had the world over. <br />\\"The Company\\" not only explains the historical arguments that have been front and center of the debate about the role that companies should play, but it also captures the timeless forces that have shaped, and are likely to keep shaping, the debate in the future. Certainly a book no one would like to miss.	2004-02-13

Formerly a Thatcher conservative and now a market skeptic, Mr. Gray's credentials alone take him a long way. It is no wonder, then, that what he has to write about globalization should be worth reading.<br />All the same, \\"False Dawn\\" is likely to produce mixed feelings. Its eight-fold argument is hard to keep track of, rendering interesting observations seem like unnecessary transgressions. Mr. Gray's fluid writing style that consists of short paragraphs makes for an enjoyable read, but at times, speed and brevity come at the expense of depth; all too often, the reader is likely to demand more from the book. <br />Still, the argument itself has merits, particularly in showing how free markets need a strong government to engineer them (as opposed to them springing naturally). Mr. Gray's continuous dialectic between the economic imperatives of a capitalist system and its social consequences is surely to excite skeptics of liberalism and trouble its supporters. From the perspective of political theory, Mr. Gray's contribution is invaluable.<br />But as with the arguments of many skeptics, Mr. Gray's overlooks certain uncomfortable realities. At the heart of Mr. Gray's thesis is the tradeoff between the flexibility of markets and the human need for economic security. For Mr. Gray, capitalism's very dynamism is likely to lead to its fall. At the same time, Mr. Gray pays scant reference either to the need for security itself or to the political shortfalls of providing security and social cohesion. After all, the engineering of markets came to save failing economies. It is not at all clear where Mr. Gray would have us go if not towards free markets.<br />As the argument moves from political theory to economics, its appeal lessens. The economics of globalization (bad capitalism driving out good capitalism) are at the center of Mr. Gray's thesis. What is absent, however, is a comprehensive review of the economic literature which takes issue with this position. Absent such a refutation of the opposite side of the argument, Mr. Gray invites his readers to dismiss his arguments all too easily.<br />In the end, Mr. Gray makes a (stretched) comparison between Marxism and liberalism. It is true that they are both products of the Enlightenment whose belief in reason and progress is paramount; and it is true that both need strong governments to work. But the scope of government is different under them. What is also different is the benefits that each system gives to its people-both might bring dislocation, but liberalism has many merits, while Marxism had few. <br />In fact, Mr. Gray's unwillingness to recognize how markets increase human agency more so than political participation surfaces as the primary drawback of his argument. And, Mr. Gray's overlooking of how the market too can provide for economic security might displease some forward-looking economic thinkers. <br />But for all its shortcomings, \\"False Dawn\\" is as good a book as one can find about the potential drawbacks of the global economic system. Whether Mr. Gray's prediction that anarchy is the next stage in human development comes true is another matter; but, if anarchy comes, Mr. Gray will have told us why.	2004-02-08

Books	5	32	35	N	N	A great primer on the timeless philosophy of Karl Marx	This seems like a very fair question-why should anyone bother to wrestle through the endless volumes of Karl Marx's prolific work? After all, communism died with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the demise of the Soviet Union; and, there are few economies today who would abandon the market and mimic the Soviet Union's state-planning.<br />In this short volume, Jonathan Wolff, of University College London, tries to convince us that studying Marx is worth the time and effort. He does this by analyzing in-depth Marx's entire range of philosophical pursuit-from his thoughts on religion to the \\"Jewish Question\\" to the more familiar writings of \\"The Capital\\" and the \\"Communist Manifesto.\\" <br />This intellectual trip is elegant, well-written, and surprisingly dense. It will certainly appeal to those with little or no background on Karl Marx; it will also likely fascinate veterans of Marxist thinking since Mr. Wolff's reconstruction and assessment of Marx's writings is both trenchant and comprehensive.<br />What, in the end, of the central question? The case for reading Marx is partly historic since his influence over the twentieth century is towering. But at a more fundamental level, Marx's philosophy is not about communism; in fact, Marx devotes little time analyzing why or how communism would come about and work. Marx's writings are a critique of capitalism and its salient features based on his account of human nature and history. So communism might have died in 1989, but Marx's ideas live on.	2004-02-04

Indeed, \\"From Subsistence to Exchange\\" is little more than an attempt to dispel popular misconceptions in the conventional wisdom of development economics. <br />The heart of Lord Bauer's argument is to take issue with the widespread excuses that have been put forth to explain why certain countries seem unable to prosper. Writing in times when state planning was in its intellectual apogee, Lord Bauer offered an alternative where the role of the individual and the market were central.<br />From this basic outlook follow many attacks on the fallacies of development economics. Lord Bauer dismisses with great ease the assumption that countries are poor due to the lack of adequate resources: at some point, he writes, every country was poor; if infusion of capital was a necessary condition for growth, then the West would still be living in the Stone Age.<br />But Lord Bauer does not stop there. He takes on other issues such as foreign aid. Not only is foreign aid based on the false premise of the vicious cycle of poverty, but it also creates a mentality of dependence. Even worse, the result in the recipient countries is the emergence of powerful interests whose sole purpose is to obtain a bigger piece of the aid cake.<br />Why then do rich countries offer so much aid? The answer for Lord Bauer is simple: guilt. Western and African intelligentsia does what it can to cultivate the belief that Africa's evils are of European doing. No matter that the evidence for this claim is scant or non-existent. After all, Lord Bauer writes, Africans were poor before Europeans got there and remain poor for long after they have left. <br />In the end, the message is clear. The legacy of post-war development economics was to construct a distorted image of why some countries are rich and some poor. At the basis of the convolution was the desire to find excuses for the failure to grow economically. \\"From Subsistence to Exchange\\" is a collection of essays that have rescued us from this intellectual trap.	2004-02-01

Though not aspiring to do any such thing, journalist Martin Walker has come very close to it by encapsulating the essential and enduring features that define the American character. <br />\\"I suspect that this book began unconsciously as a love letter to America from a foreigner who sees it both as a second home and as an inspiration.\\" Thus Mr. Walker begins \\"America Reborn,\\" and what follows is a chronicle of the twentieth century as marked by the lasting footprints of twenty-six larger-than-life Americans. <br />Beginning with Theodore Roosevelt's ambition and ending with Bill Clinton's new America, \\"America Reborn\\" is a sweeping narrative that couples people with their impacts on American life-Roosevelt with ambition, Woodrow Wilson with idealism, William Pershing with the army, and so on. But Mr. Walker knows that there is more to America than politics: his book includes such diverse personalities as Babe Ruth, Duke Ellington, John Steinbeck, Walt Disney, Lucky Luciano, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Katherine Hepburn. <br />In the end, the book does feel like a \\"love letter to America.\\" But it is not the kind of love which would blind the author; perhaps, it resembles that of Emma Goldman, one of Mr. Walker's heroes: \\"the kind of patriotism we represent is the kind which loves America with open eyes. Our relation to America is the same as the relation of a man who loves a woman, who is enchanted by her beauty and yet who cannot be blind to her defects.\\" It this simultaneous love and concern which makes the book both candid and remarkably enjoying.	2004-01-30

Who could have trouble believing, after all, that America's primary strategic objective is to create a global marketplace without barriers to the movement of goods, capital, ideas and people? But what starts as an exposition of this argument soon branches into various themes of diverse interest yet equal importance. <br />Andrew Bacevich, a professor at Boston University, takes on conventional wisdom. For those who are baffled by the complexity of the post Cold War world and are dismayed by America's lack of a coherent strategy, Mr. Bacevich is reassuring: America's objective, now and in the past, has been to promote global openness; \\"this books finds continuity where others see discontinuity,\\" he writes, parting ways with those who believe that globalization fundamentally reshaped American foreign policy priorities.<br />While this theme is ever-present, Mr. Bacevich covers a lot more ground. Perhaps his most telling contribution is the resurrection of Charles Beard and William Appleman Williams as trenchant observers of American foreign policy. Both Beard and Williams offer their own hypotheses about why America is driven to this ever increasing need for markets abroad. And, after this voyage into intellectual history comes Mr. Bacevich's own argument about why America is compelled to this strategy of openness.<br />All three reach the same conclusion: America's imperial quest is meant to overcome problems at home. Although Beard and Williams are polemic in their view that America's foreign adventures prologue the inevitable reckoning with domestic troubles, Mr. Bacevich adopts a more dispassionate view and offers merely a possible explanation: With America's national cohesiveness eroding, Mr. Bacevich writes, \\"an ever-expanding pie satisfying ever more expansive appetites was the only `crusade' likely to command widespread and durable popular enthusiasm.\\" <br />With this inplace, Mr. Bacevich moves on to a different point: American military assets, he contends, are increasingly used to promote global openness. This heightened willingness to use coercion has elevated the role of the military in American politics, perhaps even more so than ever before. And, this increased militarization of American politics is playing a central, if underappreciated, role in formulating as well as executing foreign policy. <br />For sure, all this is food for thought. Surprisingly enough, Mr. Bacevich has refrained as much as possible from judgments; in fact, writing a book on such a topic whilst remaining neutral is a feat in itself. All the same, Mr. Bacevich's military mind is evident throughout. A book whose aim is to show that America's chief purpose is promoting globalization would have done well to pay heed to dollar diplomacy as much as it has to gunboat diplomacy. Yet this minor objection could not abate the appeal of an otherwise outstanding book.	2004-01-21

On one end, American hegemony has coincided with an unprecedented degree of geopolitical stability and material prosperity; on the other, America has started fights when none existed and has meddled where it did not belong. In other words, some see America as a beacon, others as a beast. It is little wonder that the exercise of American power, most lately in Iraq, has proven so controversial.<br />This ambivalence was well captured by Senator Fulbright who wrote that, \\"The inconstancy of American foreign policy is not an accident but an expression of two distinct sides of the American character. Both are characterized by a kind of moralism, but one is the morality of decent instincts tempered by the knowledge of human imperfection and the other is the morality of absolute self-assurance fired by the crusader spirit.\\" Walter McDougall, of the University of Pennsylvania, tries to cast light into these American contradictions by looking into the Old (\\"Promised Land\\") and New Testament (\\"Crusader State\\") of its foreign policy. <br />Mr. McDougall's purpose is to dispel certain myths surrounding American foreign policy and unify seemingly inconsistent traditions. The former goal is achieved through a meticulous reading of primary and secondary sources; for example, Mr. McDougall renames the hallowed principles of the Old Testament: Liberty for Exceptionalism, Unilateralism for Isolationism, Expansionism for Manifest Destiny, and the American System for the Monroe Doctrine. The New Testament is similarly described in four traditions: Progressive Imperialism, Wilsonianism, Containment, and Global Meliorism. <br />What connects these diverse traditions is the belief that foreign policy should never compromise liberty at home. What is more, these traditions coexist in the American mind and influence its foreign policy. In that sense, argues Mr. McDougall, simple dichotomies between realism and idealism miss the mark; American foreign policy is at the same time \\"good, bad and ugly.\\" Only after appreciating this reality can one hope of understanding the basic tenets of American foreign policy and make sense of its apparent schizophrenia.	2004-01-19

The reasons are many-for one, absent Arabic numerals, computational mathematics were impossible. More importantly, conceiving of risk required a profound metamorphosis of the way people thought about the future: mathematicians and philosophers could only develop risk mathematics once people were convinced that the future was unpredictable and depended on their choices more so than the whims of any particular deity.<br />Most of the advances in the field came from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. Often, the impetus was gambling; in fact, most of the puzzles that mathematicians tried to solve by developing probability mathematics were related to card games or craps. After that came the actuarial science, with mathematicians gripping with questions of life expectancies and illnesses.<br />Only in the second half of the twentieth century does risk become highly mathematical, as it enters into economics and finance, where precision and quantitative data overtake rough estimations and qualitative analysis. But with the emergence of precision have also come severe criticisms-on one end from psychologists who have cast doubt on the robustness of the rational behavior hypothesis, and on the other, from chaos mathematicians who prefer non-linear and complex explanations that go against the intellectual tradition of statisticians. <br />The history of risk, readers will find out, is more interesting than expected. It is a story of gamblers, philosophers, mathematicians, economists, psychologists and many others. Most of all, it is a chronicle of an ever ending dream: to anticipate or even predict the future. Whether people will ever be able to do that is doubtful; but there is no better account of that quest than Mr. Bernstein's \\"Against the Gods.\\"	2004-01-09

Vijay Vaitheeswaran, a mechanical engineer and the energy and environment correspondent for The Economist, brings a sensible and interdisciplinary perspective and looks clearly into the future of energy.<br />According to Mr. Vaitheeswaran, there are two trends that are transforming the energy world: the decentralization of supply and the liberalization of markets. The former signals the move away from the grid and other economies-of-scale type power generators that place a premium on big size. The future of energy will be towards micropower, which is flexible and produced as close to the point of consumption as possible.<br />Even more important is the liberalization of the energy market. Carbon taxes, for example, are necessary to account for the environmental effects of carbon-based energy sources. But this liberalization cannot be half-hearted as it was in California, Mr. Vaitheeswaran warns; not only is it important to \\"get prices right,\\" but it is also vital to dispel the notion that energy is too important to be left to the markets.<br />Once these two conditions are in place, it is very likely that we can reach some zero emissions utopia. Mr. Vaitheeswaran places his money on hydrogen and for good reason. But there is no hope, he cautions, of getting there unless we understand that the energy market behaves just like any other market, where correct pricing and innovation are the only way to provide people with the kind of energy they want.	2004-01-04

In fact these types of prophesies make for good reading but, usually, silly predictions. To those who expect to read about the \\"fall of great powers,\\" \\"coming anarchies,\\" \\"clash of civilizations,\\" or \\"end of histories,\\" (to name a few futuristic bestsellers), Bill Emmott's book will appear rather dull and unimaginative. But it may well turn out to be more accurate than most other looks into the crystal ball. <br />Broadly speaking, forecasts suffer from two drawbacks: either they focus too much on detail and miss important underlying trends, or they try to conceive of a grand vision and lose touch with reality in the process. Bill Emmott, editor of The Economist since 1993, has tried to overcome these two problems by synthesizing his journalistic attention to detail with his historical instincts that add perspective to his argument. The product is a carefully balanced vision of where the world is headed. <br />Mr. Emmott believes that two big questions will define the fate of this century: will American hegemony continue and will capitalism survive? For both, he is optimistic. America's main elements of power, he argues, are unaltered-its tolerance of capitalism, its meritocracy and its focus on education. At the same time, potential rivals, for different reasons, are unlikely to take over any time soon. Terrorism, while important, is also unlikely to play a world-altering role in the coming years.<br />What about capitalism? After the end of the cold war, capitalism's intellectual and political allegiance has grown stronger. This trend is likely to continue, provided that capitalism deals with its biggest challenges-its unpopularity, uncleanness, inequality, and instability. Mr. Emmott goes at great length to show that the capitalist future is not certain-but he also shows with great conviction that most objections to capitalism are unfounded. <br />Mr. Emmott writes that he looks into the future with the outlook of a paranoid optimist: progress will continue, albeit with setbacks here and there. All too often, books on the future take on a big claim and foresee some radical new world order. A book predicting that the status quo will continue well into this century seems out of place with the futuristic literature. That may disappoint many readers. But that does not mean that Mr. Emmott is not right.	2004-01-01

After the 1994 framework de facto broke down in 2002, all bets about how to deal with North Korea were off. The world had to start over. <br />America was not only focused on Iraq (thus putting on hold dealing with North Korea), but it also lacked any comprehensive plan for diffusing the crisis. The purpose of the \\"Crisis in the Korean Peninsula,\\" by Michael O'Hanlon and Mike Mochizuki, is to fill this gap and offer a broad strategy about what to do with North Korea. <br />The plan is both comprehensive and ambitious. In fact, ambition is its chief attraction; Mr. O'Hanlon and Mr. Mochizuki do not want to diffuse the crisis, they want to resolve it. That means offering North Korea an alternative future with more security and more prosperity. This \\"grand bargain\\" entails abandoning nuclear weapons, reducing conventional forces, obtaining security guarantees from America, reforming economically (modeled after China or Viet Nam), launching a dialogue on human rights, and returning Japanese kidnapped victims.<br />The big question, of course, is whether such a plan is realistic. The authors do their best to show that it is. America, China, Russia, South Korea and Japan can all benefit from stability and prosperity in the peninsula. What about North Korea? This is an enigma, but the authors' argument that Pyongyang might go for it is both persuasive and interesting.<br />When everything else has failed, there is little harm in changing course. But Mr. O'Hanlon and Mr. Mochizuki have produced a great vision from this dead end; this book is an incisive look into the history of the conflict with North Korea and a road map to solving it. At least, if this plan fails, the authors argue, the world will know for sure that there is no reform for North Korea--no carrots, just sticks. But their plan surely deserves a chance to work first.	2003-12-31

Economists have been baffled by the miracle of economic growth and have offered various hypotheses to account for its existence: the expansion of markets, the enforcement of property rights, strong governments that invest wisely, Protestant ethics, Asian values, international trade, technological growth, people's savings, and so on.<br />While theories abound, the economic profession, smitten by the desire to quantify, has often been too narrow in its approach to development. Discussing what motivates economic growth usually entails the use of elaborate equations and complex graphs. \\"Development as Freedom\\" is a both welcoming exception to that rule, and a direct challenge to it.<br />The thesis that Amartya Sen, winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics, puts forward is that freedom is and should be both the means and the ends of development. The former (that freedom promotes development) flies in the face of conventional wisdom that prioritizes economic growth over political enfranchisement. Yet Mr. Sen defends with eloquence, both theoretical and empirical. <br />As for the latter, Mr. Sen offers an alternative to the \\"growth per capita\\" approach to economic development. Development, Mr. Sen contends, should be a process by which people can live the lives they have reason to value. This thesis can be traced back to the writings of the classical economists, and more recently to Frederick Hayek and Peter Bauer. But one would be hard pressed to find policy makers today speaking in terms of enhancing people's freedoms rather than merely increasing their incomes. <br />In the end, \\"Development as Freedom\\" is probably the most ambitious work on development economics in last quarter century. It shares with other classics an attempt to encompass the various processes of economic development under one theme-in this case, freedom. Yet, what is remarkable is not how much Mr.Sen has brought in under the umbrella of freedom, but how little he has left out.	2003-12-12

Reading \\"Manias, Panics, and Crashes\\" will surely change their mind. Bubbles, they will learn, are an enduring feature of financial markets, and generations of investors have fallen in the trap of buying very high to sell even higher, only to find that the frenzy cannot last for ever.<br />The mania part of the story is familiar: a new invention will revolutionize the economic landscape and bring forth unimaginable profits. The abundance of credit, coupled with leverage (buying with borrowed money), accelerates this process and buying leads to more buying. Then comes the panic: some event shakes confidence and wakes up investors to the mania that has clouded their judgment. This panic leads to a crash: borrowed money needs to be repaid and investors will sell anything at any price to meet the bankers' needs.<br />Charles Kindleberger has chronicled dozens of financial bubbles spanning more than four centuries. His historiography is impressive and the reader can often wonder how Kindleberger amassed such large amounts of data: his sources are primary and secondary, and they come from economics, history, politics, and even literature. The text is well written and the reader hardly notices that the ride covers centuries' worth of financial troubles.<br />What, in the end, is Kindleberger's moral? Most cures for dealing with financial troubles, he writes, are no cures at all. Raising interest rates has not proven particularly useful and neither has continued warning from authorities that the investing public is inflating a bubble. The solution, he believes, lies in having a lender of last resort. The trick, of course, is to avoid moral hazard and prevent the public from gambling due to the reassurance of a lender of last resort. The answer is ambiguity: the lender can come in and save the day but investors should never be certain that help is forthcoming.<br />In the end, \\"Manias, Panics, and Crashes\\" is a classic account of financial bubbles and its immense history and shrewd analysis will appeal to both the layman and the expert. And the book's message, that financial bubbles have to be met with an artful lender, should be taken at heart by those interested in the past and future of financial crises.be certain that help is forthcoming. <br />In the end, \\"Manias, Panics, and Crashes\\" is a classic account of financial bubbles and its immense history and shrewd analysis will appeal to both the layman and the expert.

But unlike common perception that values financial markets based on their profitability, their more important function is to manage risks: shares are sold to investors to spread out risk-if money is made in the process, all the better.<br />What is surprising is that despite the extensiveness and complexity of our financial nexus, many risks that people face are not currently covered: what happens, say, if your job is taken over by a computer? Or, if you spend seven years in school specializing in a field for which there is no market after you graduate? There is no protection against these threats. Yet, unemployment has a more adverse impact on welfare than any movement of the Dow Jones or the Euro/Dollar exchange rate. Financial markets can help people manage the latter, but not the former. <br />In this sense, risk management is limited. Extending its scope to manage more risks is the subject of Robert Shiller's book. Mr. Shiller, of Yale University, has put together his vision for the future: a New Financial Order where risk management can serve the people, not just investors who know the markets. \\"The New Financial Order\\" is an ambitious work, and although Mr. Shiller tries to show that baby steps have been made towards that vision, it is clear that he is thinking far ahead-decades, even more. <br />But what is this new order? Mr. Shiller's world is build around six pillars: livelihood and home values insurance, macro-markets where aggregate risks can be traded, income-linked loans, inequality insurance, intergenerational social security, and international agreements for risk control. These ideas are grand, as will be the markets needed to implement them. <br />This financial order is an attempt to reduce the effect of randomness on our lives. All these instruments, in different ways, will allow a more equitable and efficientsharing of risk, making people better off. If in the past few centuries, financial innovation led to economic prosperity, then the future of finance will be to create economic security. \\"The New Financial Order\\" is a blueprint towards that goal.	2003-12-02
US	44527921	RL96I58HMR1CK	0767907183	373262786	Irrational Exuberance	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Psychologizing Markets	Stock markets are complex and mysterious creatures. Predicting their behavior is a fantasy that has persisted in investors' minds for ages, and various tricks have been conjured to anticipate (and profit) from stock movements. What all these techniques have in common in an expectation that markets can indeed be predicted-and that they all, invariably, fail.<br />Robert Shiller, of Yale University, contributes to this debate by canvassing the salient features that characterize the stock market. First, he argues that markets tend to be irrational: prices skyrocket based on frenzy, not fact. Price-earning ratios, for example, tend to move much higher than earnings, implying that expectations are not based on higher expected earnings. The same irrationality, Mr. Shiller continues, can be observed in the relation of stock prices to dividends: stock prices are more volatile than dividends, meaning that prices cannot be fully reflective of expected dividends, as the efficient market theory would predict.<br />So what determines stock prices then? This is the book's most creative part, at least for those familiar with economics but not psychology. Two factors, the media and \\"new era\\" thinking, tend to create an undue optimism about markets, causing prices to exceed rational limits. These two trends, however, are amplified by psychological phenomena: an overwhelming trust in the opinion of authorities, overconfidence in one's investment strategy, a linear reasoning that cannot be defended against uncertainties or complications, and so on.<br />Any reader should be impressed by the complexity and accessibility of Mr. Shiller's analysis. If his book is taken as a prognosis of the 1990's bubble bursting, then \\"Irrational Exuberance\\" is a timely warning that proved correct. But what makes this book a classic is its magnificent combination of economics, econometrics, sociology and psychology in analyzing the stock market. This much needed interdisciplinary work makes this book amust read for investors and policymakers alike.	2003-11-30

The answer is yes. It is not that \\"Lombard Street\\" is a classic that one finds quoted many a time; the reader's interest should transcend historical inquiry or curiosity; \\"Lombard Street\\" should be read and revered by anyone interested in the underlying, abiding features of financial markets. <br />But what are those characteristics? Bagehot, then editor of The Economist, writes that credit centers on trust: \\"Credit means that a certain confidence is given, a certain trust reposed.\\" And, banks always have on-demand liabilities that far exceed their readily available assets. In short, credit works on trust, and the system, in the absence of trust, can fall apart rapidly. <br />What follows from these premises is a careful examination of how the money market came about, what its uses are, how its operations are connected to trade and country's overall welfare, and, most importantly, how central banks can deal with financial crises. Written elegantly, \\"Lombard Street\\" is, at the same time, an introductory overview of the market and a trenchant analysis of its most salient features.<br />But what makes \\"Lombard Street\\" timeless is that it deals with finance in its human form. Bagehot talks about power, prestige and perception as much as he does about interest, discount, and credit. Trust is based on institutions and people: the human features of finance-trust, anxiety, mania, optimism-are timeless and apply to the financial markets of the nineteenth, twentieth, or twenty-first century. That is why \\"Lombard Street\\" is an ever useful introduction and guide.	2003-11-23

Do the Jews have the right to a state in Palestine? Did Israel cause the Palestinian refugee problem? Is Israel overly aggressive and excessively repressive? What is the biggest obstacle to peace in the Middle East? How can the conflict end?<br />These are some of the questions that Alan Dershowitz, of Harvard Law School, attempts to answer in \\"The Case for Israel.\\" But, first, why does this case need to be made? Mr. Dershowitz believes there is a systematic attempt to misrepresent the facts of the Middle East conflict in order to tilt public opinion in favor of the Palestinians; thus, debate in the media and (particularly) in academia is all too often biased against Israel.<br />So what are these facts that are being distorted? Mr. Dershowitz, for one, challenges the presumption that Jews are foreigners to Palestine. The role that other Arab countries have played in prolonging the misery of the Palestinians is another of his targets, as is the responsibility that the Palestinians bear for the failure of the two-state solution to come to fruition (the two state solution is inevitable, Mr. Dershowitz believes). The singling out of Israel for vices that it does not commit or that others commit in far greater lengths is another theme that stands out.<br />Rarely do books take on so widely held views so openly and directly. The referential style of the book helps the reader navigate easily; but anyone who reads it cover to cover cannot fail to notice some repetition (including the usage of the same quote multiple times). Producing a book that balances the pro-Palestinian side of the argument is a daunting task but one at which Mr. Dershowitz has succeeded admirably. This book cannot be absent from anyone's reading list on the Middle East, though newcomers to the topic might find it more rewarding than veterans of the conflict.	2003-11-10

To narrate the history of financial bubbles is to chronicle those times when people overlooked that fact. In those instances, asset prices soar merely to be resold for profit, with little regard as to their actual value; when something shakes confidence and buyers are in short supply, a crash follows as prices were sustainable only insofar as they could be resold higher. <BR> <BR>According to John Galbraith, the stock-market crash that took place in the fall of 1929 was typical of this prototype. Mr. Galbraith, a Harvard economist, traced the optimism to the Florida real-estate bubble of 1925 which made people forget the elementary rules of money making. What follows is an elegant narrative that interweaves economics with history to produce one of the most telling and lucid accounts of the developments, economic and otherwise, that lead up to the October 1929 crash.<BR> <BR>The crash, according to Mr. Galbraith, was caused by an admixture of bad income distribution (economy too dependent on luxury spending and investment), bad corporate structure, bad banking structure, foreign imbalances, and bad economic intelligence. In seeking compelling explanations, the &quot;Great Crash&quot; often resists conventional wisdom: for example, to those who blame the abundance of credit, Mr. Galbraith answers: &quot;on numerous occasions before and since credit has been easy, and there has been no speculation whatever.&quot; Mr. Galbraith looks beyond central banking and interest rates to compile a rich and diverse history of the 1929 crash.<BR> <BR>So what about preventing future crises? Here, Mr. Galbraith is ambivalent. Regulation has and can play a substantial role in preventing future troubles. But the problem lies elsewhere: people continue to believe that they have been blessed, and that they can make money with little or no effort. When wise men see such folly and decide to partake in it rather than spoil it, a bubble that later crashes is inevitable. For all those who seek an economic solution to this economic problem, Mr. Galbraith surely disappoints. The surest protection against over-speculation, he writes, is to remind people that you can never get something from nothing. Those in love with central banking might find the idea simplistic, yet its beauty lies with its simplicity.	2003-10-29

America ought to be come to grips with this reality and prepare for the inevitable, by ensuring that no major war breaks out as a result of this emerging multipolarity. <br />That is the image of the future conjured up by Charles Kupchan, a professor at Georgetown University, in the \\"End of the American Era.\\" The thesis is built on a historical journey, which turns out to be both an asset and a liability -- at times, history captures the reader and elucidates contemporary trends; often, the historical narratives seem irrelevant, over-emphasized or under-analyzed (i.e. distorted to support a hypothesis rather than used to form one). And, the recitation of obvious or familiar points is likely to bore those with a sound background in foreign policy.<br />If the geopolitical image painted in this book is interesting, the geo-economic one is less so. That is mainly because Professor Kupchan has spent little to no time analyzing economics -- either in their own might, or in their relation to international politics. Where economic analysis is found, it is usually too superficial to impress. <br />The books' recommendations -- broadly speaking, multilateralism and humility in conducing foreign policy -- are neither novel nor counterintuitive. The highpoint rests in the rationale Professor Kupchan provides for his policies: the inevitability of America's relative decline and the need for the United States to ensure a peaceful transition rather than try hold on to its power indefinitely. Whether anyone in Washington takes these ideas at heart is a whole other story, especially since implementing his ideas could be a self-fulfilling prophesy.	2003-10-04

He has identified eight defining moments that shaped the evolution of humans since the beginning of time: becoming human, inventing civilization, developing a conscience, seeking a lasting peace, achieving rationality, uniting the planet, releasing nature's energies, and ruling ourselves.<br />The author's treatment appeals to those interested in an introductory history, though the book's easy flow is sure to not bore anyone. The \\"Way of the World\\" is well suited for a history or an introductory international relations class, and especially for readers who wish to gain an overview of human history within which to frame further investigation. The book's rich bibliography also serves that purpose.<br />Equally interesting is the author's prediction of the future. Professor Fromkin uses historiography to pass onto educated futurology; he offers his own account of where the world is heading by referring to others who have stared in the crystal ball and prophesized the future (wisely or poorly) and by investigating closely current trends. This blend of compelling story-telling, academic study and well grounded prognostication sets the book apart.	2003-09-11

(Commercialization is defined as \\"efforts within the university to make profit from teaching, research and other campus activities.\\") In particular, Professor Bok has taken on three major themes: commercialization of athletics, research and education (online teaching, extension programs, etc.)<br />For one, this book is a useful reality check. Through scores of studies, Professor Bok dispels the myth that these three activities are profitable. Save few exceptions, these endeavors prove financially disastrous. More than that, there are the hidden dangers of compromising a university's academic standards and standing in the community. The call for a candid evaluation of the costs of commercialization is half of the book's theme.<br />The other half outlines prescriptions and guidelines for university presidents about how to handle these increased pressures. Professor Bok suggests revision to NCAA rules, and university oversight and care to limit the influence of corporate sponsors over research or the curriculum taught in schools. <br />In the end, \\"Universities in the Marketplace\\" is a reminder that universities are built around values: \\"the larger message of a liberal arts education [is] that there is more to life than making money.\\" These values and the collaborative spirit, on which universities thrive, are threatened by the mistaken perception that there is money to be made by exploiting a school's name. The adherence to high standards is an old prescription for new pressures, and the one that Professor Bok suggests as the ultimate guideline for dealing with the threats of the future.	2003-09-10

At the same time, Mr. Kagan suggests an original idea to explain the split in the West: the European Union, he argues, is predicated on the notion that institutions can resolve deep historical conflicts; if European were to accept the Hobbesian view, Mr. Kagan argues, they would deny the revolutionary nature of their project, as well as its implications for other regions of the world.<br />Still, this book is selective: there is little mention of Somalia, where Americans withdrew to avoid casualties, or Rwanda, where French forces moved in before UN peacekeepers. The British intervention in Sierra Leone and the French one in Cote d'Ivoire are similar examples of the European attitude to force, which hardly coincide with Mr. Kagan's view.<br />Mr. Kagan has argued, in essence, that the Europeans lack the collective capacity to act; but their attitude to power might not be as scornful as Mr. Kagan suggests. Still, it is impossible to study the relationship between Europe and America, and their respective roles in the world today, without reading this book.	2003-08-31

A second, and more serious, drawback is the book's inexplicable starting point, with excludes both the Roman Empire and the era of Alexander the Great. Finally, the author has no notes or bibliography; for such a work, a \\"suggested reading list\\" or \\"selected bibliography\\" would have been greatly appreciated.<br />Still, the book is splendid and will appeal both to the expert and the layman. And its ultimate message, that peace is neither natural nor guaranteed, should be taken at heart by scholars and politicians alike.	2003-08-31

But Anthony Pagden, a professor at UCLA, aimed at doing just that and has ended up with a splendid overview of the history of empires. <br />The book starts with Alexander the Great and ends with the European Union and globalization, analyzing how the concept and practice of empire has evolved over the years. And, as is rarely the case with other narratives, the author discusses both European and non-European empires (to be more precise, he explains how non-European empires differed and why they do not deserve proportional mention). <br />Surely, the book's brevity can be irritating: often, the reader may seek additional details or even references. But, Professor Pagden has done a masterful job at writing succinctly and covering, with few words, elaborate topics without sacrificing depth or insight. I am not sure if it is possible to write a world history of this magnitude in such a short book -- but if such a history had to be written, the result should look much like this book.	2003-08-30

Written in plain language that does not assume prior knowledge of business or economics, this guide covers all the major topics that entrepreneurs face in setting up and managing a business: writing up a business plan, compiling and understanding financial statements, making a company profitable, valuing a company, and raising money.<br />On the one hand, Professor Rogers has written a reference book that assembles much of the information that people intuitively know. In that sense, the guide can be useful to people who want to make sure they are \\"not forgetting something.\\" On the other hand, though, this guide tackles many issues that quite a few entrepreneurs look down upon: for example, accounting. Professor Rogers not only explains how entrepreneurs should handle the mundane aspects of business like accounting, but also elucidates why entrepreneurs should pay attention to those aspects at all. In doing so, he alerts entrepreneurs about the kind of problems they may face and recommends action to prevent them. <br />Professor Rogers has compiled anecdotes, business quotations, industry data, and mathematical formulae (which he explains in detail), to write an accessible guide for aspiring business owners. This balance, between serious and humorous, and fact and theory makes the book both fun to read and very useful -- a definite read for those daunted by the prospect of starting their own business.	2003-08-30

As is often the case with second hand accounts, textbooks have distorted and watered down Adam Smith. Going back to the original text is both refreshing and enlightening.<br />The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" remains the most truthful defense of the economic science. But remember that Adam Smith also wrote \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\"; for Smith, economics was a search to better people's life rather than simply a quest to optimize mathematical functions or estimate variables using econometric models.<br />To simply associate Smith with expressions such as the \\"invisible hand,\\" does not do him justice. Take, for example, the opening chapter on the division of labor: first, Smith defends the division of labor as being efficient; then, he defends it as an essential component of the freedom to allocate one's labor to one's talents; finally, he links the division of labor to trade: without the freedom to exchange the fruits of one's labor, the division of labor is meaningless. The point is that Adam Smith defends the rationale for the market, rather than just explain its mechanics.<br />Anyone studying economics in school would think that economics is all about efficiency; this preoccupation, inevitably, breeds economists who support the market simply because it works. But to read Adam Smith is to enter the realm of an economic science where the ultimate benchmark is not efficiency but human freedom and welfare. That is, probably, what Smith would remark if he were to sit in an economics class today, and why the \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is as revolutionary today as it was two centuries ago.	2003-08-27

First are those who will be fascinated by the travel itself, and the author's encounter of different cultures and attitudes. In that sense, \\"Adventure Capitalist\\" is a state-of-the-world kind of book in which Mr. Rogers goes beyond what is reported in the news (or, often, not reported in the West) and gives a first-hand account of life in distant lands. (But Mr. Rogers tends to gloss over a few countries, sharing too little about his time in them.)<br />Second, Mr. Rogers puts together an investor's handbook by giving financial advice about investing in dozens of countries. Mr. Rogers is very straightforward about his reasons for investing in one place over another; thus, \\"Adventure Capitalist\\" has ended being a rich anthology of investment experience that can prove helpful to anyone interested in economics. <br />Either as a travel-book or as an investor's guide, \\"Adventure Capitalist\\" is sure to captivate you if only because it offers a fascinating account of how things really are in places where most people will only ever reach by a book like this. Mr. Rogers has lived, as he says, everyone's dream; and then, he has come back to tell us about it.	2003-08-15

Frederick Hayek, a Nobel Prize economist, outlines in depth the philosophical distinction between Western liberal values and German and Soviet totalitarianism.<br />Hayek addresses the basic tenets of socialism, or more accurately, economic planning. In a planned economy, he argues, people delegate responsibility to a higher body and slowly lose their moral agency and personal freedom; and, he shows that economic planning is inevitably dehumanizing, producing regimes that sacrifice freedom, morality and truth in pursuit of their conception of the \\"common good.\\" \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" conveys succinctly the intellectual basis of the Cold War and presents the inevitable link between economic planning and totalitarianism; anyone who thinks the Soviet Union was a twisted application of a noble ideal should give \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" a close read.<br />More than half a century after its publication, \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" is still applicable. Hayek's discussion of liberalism is timeless and warns that economic planning does little more than take away our freedom. That is probably the message Hayek would have for those who feel burdened by the complexity of globalization and look to the state for help. Better than anyone, Hayek points clearly to the line that should separate the state from the market; and, he shows that the ultimate victor from this separation is human freedom.	2003-08-09

Microsoft's Cult of the Puzzle - How the World's Smartest Company Selects the Most Creative Thinkers	Books	4	54	56	N	N	A world where puzzles matter	\\"How Would You Move Mount Fuji?\\" is an easy, one-sitting kind of read. That is, unless you decide to try to solve all the puzzles in the book, in which case the time you will need to finish it will depend on your ability to solve puzzles (and your determination to maintain a normal life that is not overtaken by the need to solve every question).<br />In essence, the book is separated into two parts. The first discusses the history of puzzles and their intellectual and academic standing. This section starts off by narrating the origin of puzzle-solving as a criterion for selecting people; then, it talks about how and why many companies use them in interviews. Mr. Poundstone talks about the general approaches to solving puzzles, and then closes on a note for employers on how to design puzzles that are useful.<br />The second part of the book is the strict puzzle solving. The book has plenty of puzzles scattered through it and two chapters devoted solely to listing puzzles. From page 147 onwards, Mr. Poundstone discusses the puzzles he has listed and suggests thought processes about how to solve them. This exposition is more interesting than it sounds; for one, Mr. Poundstone explains his answers thoroughly; for another, he uncovers many layers of thinking, that show the complexity (and beauty) of the art of solving puzzles.<br />\\"How Would You Move Mount Fuji?\\" might give you a few tips and tricks, but is hardly a handbook of how to get the job of your dreams. Rather, it is an enjoyable book that will capture you in the world of puzzles for however long you decide to take to read through it.	2003-08-09

The story takes place in 1882, when Doctor Breuer accepted to help Nietzsche fight his hemicrania and despair. What follows is a captivating story of intrigue, betrayal and the development of an intimate friendship. But the book's highlight is the dialogue between Nietzsche and Breuer, in which the author touches upon the issues of life, death, love, lust, passion and freedom.<br />In the process of the story, Irvin Yalom presents Nietzsche's philosophy in a portrayal that is candid and captures the complicated mystique of the brilliant philosopher. And, Dr. Yalom's story-telling is so lucid that one can fully comprehend the logic of Nietzsche's philosophy. In the end, \\"When Nietzsche Wept\\" is a window into Nietzsche's innermost thoughts and psyche.<br />Equally compelling is Yalom's discussion of psychoanalysis. If Nietzsche's words are half of the book's appeal, the other half has to be the development of the dialogue between Nietzsche and Breuer. The psychoanalytical method is being invented as the book progresses -- and Dr. Yalom has done an excellent job of presenting the foundations of psychoanalysis as if springing out of spontaneous dialogue between two men.<br />This book is not only an excellent and easy read, but also highly didactic, appealing to those interested in philosophy or psychology. But more broadly, Dr. Yalom's words have such power and applicability that no one could be left uninterested in what he has to say.	2003-08-04

In this well written book, the reader becomes acquainted not only with Mr. Stephanopoulos' reflections, but also with basic facts about life in the West Wing. <br />The greatest asset of the book is Mr. Stephanopoulos' candor: he does not shy away from criticizing himself and others. Occasionally, he breaks off from the narrative and shares his inner thoughts; those injections add new dimensions to the story, making the book more interesting and enjoyable.<br />\\"All Too Human\\" is truly, as the book's subheading claims, \\"a political education.\\" First, the wealth of experience contained in these pages is, in and of itself, valuable. Mr. Stephanopoulos has chosen to pick certain evens and discuss them in detail; in doing so, he has compiled a useful handbook for political operatives.<br />Second, \\"All Too Human\\" sheds light into what really happens in the White House: if one asked, \\"what is it like to work for a president?\\" they could easily turn to \\"All Too Human\\" for an answer. The truth is that political aides often deal with auxiliary topics (in President Clinton's case, sexual and legal scandals); Mr. Stephanopoulos interweaves the discussion of the president's political agenda with those auxiliary issues.<br />Mr. Stephanopoulos has written more than his experiences in the White House; he has written about what working in the White House did to him: the stress, the dilemmas and the obsession with power. Those interested in politics should give \\"All Too Human\\" a careful read.	2003-08-02

In this book, Dr. Silber tackles what he thinks is wrong with America: a preoccupation with material affluence and a degradation of moral and spiritual value.<br />For one, Dr. Silber proposes the (re)introduction of ethical teaching in schools. More, he calls for ethical considerations in all professions. At the heart of his discontent is the general tendency to abstain from rigorous debate and critical thinking. He is thus very careful to add substance and facts to his arguments, which makes his book an enjoyable and thought-provoking read. Regardless of whether one agrees with him, Dr. Silber's criticisms and recommendations need to be taken seriously by those interested in the connection between a country's educational system and its society.<br />The weakest parts of the book are those that deal with foreign policy. His chapter on Central America has little to do with the book's topic (\\"what's wrong with America\\") and more to do with the fact that Dr. Silber has served on President Reagan's National Bipartisan Commission on Central America. The conclusions of his chapter on foreign policy appear, with hindsight, to be largely incorrect, though no author could ever be blamed for failing to anticipate the end of the Cold War.<br />More than a decade after its publication, many of this book's recommendations might seem outdated; but what remains is the well articulated link between the health of a county's educational system and its society.	2003-07-07

Noreen Hertz argues that multinational corporations have become very powerful and politicians very weak; her thesis is best captured in this sentence: \\"by giving corporate wishes such priority, by defining themselves solely in terms of economic success, by supporting international institutions that value economic interests above all else, governments are in danger of becoming the puppets of business\\" (p.86).<br />But, as Dr. Hertz recognizes, this is nothing new. Indeed, one of the book's defects is the inability to connect global capitalism with many of the current trends. If anything, globalization lessens the grip that business have on politicians by opening up markets; as The Economist put it, \\"Far from empowering global fat cats, free trade holds corporate power in check and assaults the excess profits that protectionism, courtesy of pro-business politicians, gouges from the public\\" (28 Jun 03).<br />Still, Dr. Hertz raises some issues that are distinctively global: industry migration and tax competition. But Dr. Hertz seems to accept these arguments without skepticism: for example, she has a page-long citation on the debate about the \\"dirty industry migration\\" argument; after a dozen citations, she reduces her stance to saying that the argument makes intuitive sense, which is hardly a responsible stance in so contested a debate.<br />For all its defects, \\"The Silent Takeover\\" is right to point out that businesses are gaining power through politics, and that fixing the system requires some disconnection between them. That's the real message to take home from this book.	2003-07-07

But she spends little time on this; while Mrs. Huffington has put together an impressive list of political wrongs, her collection of \\"success stories\\" is rather modest (not sure if that is the product of poor research or poor activism).<br />This book is witty and well written, and Arianna Huffington spared none in her criticism. Her ideas should be taken seriously by anyone interested in the health and future of the American political system.	2003-07-03

First, it makes the liberal case for globalization, tracing the benefits of international exchange and competition to the classical economists; and it supports that case with logic and numbers. <br />Then, one by one, it discusses equity markets, tax policies, global businesses, inequality, aid, the environment, technology and international finance. In the process, this book puts together an impressive collection of facts: it asks the question \\"what are people saying about globalization\\" and then evaluates perceptions and prescriptions against data from think-tanks and academics.<br />This balance between theory and fact makes the book appealing. Globalization could not have a more articulate advocate than The Economist, and this book includes the best articles that have appeared in the magazine; if one had to read only one book on globalization, this should be it.	2003-07-01

Thus, he ignores many of the lessons of the pre-1914 globalization. To argue (as he does) that this era of globalization is different does not render all analogies to the past useless. <br />Second, Mr. Friedman is caught in many clichés about globalization: with few exceptions, Mr. Friedman rarely says, \\"but this widespread perception is wrong.\\" Next to his anecdotal compilation, he could have used some academic sources to dispel some of the myths about globalization. He does that sporadically but not enough.<br />Lastly, Mr. Friedman presents the weaker case for globalization: its inevitability; there is a stronger (liberal) case to make in favor of globalization. For the most part, Mr. Friedman shies away from that, and retains his \\"there is no alternative\\" lens. That's a great injustice to globalization. <br />Still, I don't think one can make a reading list on globalization that excludes \\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree.\\" But if I had to read one book on globalization, this wouldn't be it.	2003-06-29

Books	5	1	1	N	N	A great book on Iceland &amp; Small States	Michael Corgan has written an invaluable book targeted to three different audiences: those interested in Iceland, small states and foreign affairs in general.<br />For those interested in Icelandic security and politics, this book is accessible and comprehensive. It appeals to the layman with no background on Iceland and ties eleven centuries of history in one chronological and thematic whole. More importantly, Professor Corgan has illuminated the foundations of Icelandic security policy and has grasped with precision the manner in which those traditions are changing. Having conducted surveys and interviews with policymakers on the island, one would have to work hard to find a more authoritative study on the subject. <br />Regarding small states, Professor Corgan has rejuvenated an interested that died away in the 1970s. One of the questions raised in the book is, how can a country like Iceland (with no military and no willingness or capacity to form one) provide for its security? Through international institutions, the author writes. What is more impressive is the short span in which Iceland has been able to develop an autochthonous security policy. As Professor Corgan recognizes, one case study cannot form the basis of even a weak theory; yet the conclusions drawn in the last chapter can be relevant to many policy makers of small states.<br />Professor Corgan has studied an extensive period of Icelandic security policy; unlike other authors in the field of small states, he has been able to study the development of a security policy under very different conditions. With few exceptions, authoritative studies on small states take a narrow temporal approach that fails to trace changes in the policymaking of states based on changing internal or international conditions. This book transcends this typical limitation.<br />Lastly, this book should interest the general public because the way this book has been written can be an example for similar studies. Professor Corganhas used his experience and connections in Iceland to write about Iceland's take on security matters. He has been able to synthesize a seemingly unrelated sequence of events and, alluding to Iceland's history and culture, he has shown how they have played an important role in Iceland's relationship with NATO and the United States. Similar studies that are sensitive to non-American perspectives on security are invaluable because what often appears as a minor issue in the bilateral relations of two states is, by virtue of different angles and culture, a major source of discord. <br />Professor Corgan, who served in Iceland with the US Navy, has done more that bring the American perspective to Iceland; he has brought the Icelandic perspective to America. That is the greatest legacy of this book.	2003-06-25

His thesis is straightforward: democracy needs to come hand in hand with constitutional liberalism -- a codified respect for individual liberties. This book raises an alert: let's not fall in love with democracy so much that we forget that the tyranny of the majority and the minority are equally disastrous and unwanted.<br />At the same time, however, this book makes me a bit pessimistic. The origins of constitutional liberalism in Europe and America can be traced to competition between power centers (read: limited authority). Constitutional liberalism and democracy come together through evolution, not by design. At no point does Zakaria show how design can produce this necessary symbiosis between liberalism and democracy (his idea of delegation is the only exception, but it's too short to be impressive). That's why I think the book is a good reminder, but I would like to have read more of Zakaria's thoughts on &quot;The Way Out.&quot;	2003-06-17

His thesis is that developing countries have failed to produce capital, which is the driving force of economic activity and surplus. At the center of this failure is the inability to establish clear ownership of property and to produce a unified system for the exchange and fungibility of property.<br />For one, Mr. de Soto has provided data on developing countries (collected by his own team on the ground). According to his numbers, the value of the real estate held but not legally owned by the poor in the Third World and ex-communist nations reaches $9.3 trillion. In general, the extralegal sector accounts for about 50 to 70 percent of the workforce in developing countries and from one-fifth to two-thirds of economic output. Alone, these numbers point to a staggering underground economy that does not get accounted for by official statistics.<br />The statistical lag is only part of his story. The essence of Mr. de Soto's argument is that countries need to think of capital (property in this case) in its value-generating rather that physical form. Establishing who owns what is not simply an engineering or mapmaking task; it is a legal job that unifies informal property arrangements into an official legal code. This legal and political challenge is what much of this book is about, and much of what Mr. de Soto's think-tank does. <br />More importantly, Mr. de Soto has offered a unifying thesis to deal with the topic of economic development: the conversion of \\"dead capital\\" that cannot generate surplus value into live capital that can galvanize an economy. Rightly, Mr. de Soto argues that this conversion is essential as to bring capitalist benefits to those who are now disenfranchised.	2003-06-14
