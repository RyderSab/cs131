Even the mediocre TWELVE by Nick McDonell has a little more to offer.  The sexual subject matter here is descriptive but seems rather silly at some points, and no more shocking than your basic MTV video.<br />I'll keep an eye out for his next book, but this one is second rate.	2004-04-15

Almond takes a wonderful journey through the many candy corporations in America.  As always, Almond delivers the goods with great humor and literary excellence.  You get not only a first hand account of some the inner workings of these candy factories, but you have it presented beautifully, in Almond's own special way.<br />He takes the reader to the more sublime makers, everything from Necco (been a while since you had a Mary Jane?) to the Idaho Candy Company who makes something called an Idaho Spud.  The book will find appeal with readers of literature as well as those of us who jones for a little extra sugar in our diet.  Excellent read and worth adding to your collection, especially for anyone who enjoyed MY LIFE IN HEAVY METAL.	2004-04-13

It is a horribly honest and self-effacing look at the torment one man (and the folks in his life) have gone through having been abandoned in the Chicago juvenile care system.  All throughout the story, Elliott speaks honestly and beautifully, exposing his most vulnerable side in an eloquent way:<br />&quot;He would come and get me about once a week; I never knew exactly when. I'd wait in my room for him. I remember Mr. Gracie's hands closing around my neck, how I couldn't breathe, and then how I didn't want to breathe. I remember how his body felt warm on my back and how, when he pulled away from me, I felt exposed, as if somebody had yanked a blanket off me.&quot;<br />The story is heavy and will linger with you.  Fans of Augusten Burroughs will see some similarities here, but don't expect any laughter (or very little.)  The novel is both story-driven and literary.  Worth the price.	2004-03-31

There are some exceptional sections and obviously Moore knows how to put pen to paper.  But the overall story is so hollow it put me to sleep three nights in a row.

Once again Will Clarke has blended two (or more) genres for a delightful, fresh and snappy read.  Those who enjoyed LORD VISHNU'S LOVE HANDLES with welcome this novel with arms wide open.<br />THE WORTHY tells the story of a dead teenager who comes back to haunt (and torment) the man who murdered him.  The story takes place in Louisana (LSU, to be specific) among the fraternity scene on campus.  As usual, the story is packed full of sardonic humor and incisive wit and flows wonderfully from page to page.  Clarke has taken the &quot;ghost story&quot; to a new literary level and makes it a journey you will want to take over and over again.<br />There is a sure-fire hit for Palahniuk fans (especially those with a strong heart for LULLABY and DIARY.)  There are too many laughs here to list.  Just get it and read it!  You won't &quot;ignore the dead&quot; any longer!	2003-10-21

But whatever similarities exist, whether you like Dave Eggers or not, should be ignored because this book exists and thrives on its own.<br />The writing is crisp and clear and laugh-out-loud funny, sitting just up a notch from David Sedaris.  Kennedy tells stories of youth with a self-deprecating style that never shifts to the excessive or whiny.  The only restriction here is the point of reference to the generation of which Kennedy is a member.  Baby-boomers will have a hard time with some of the material, but they shouldn't shy away.  The quality of writing is strong enough to entertain-and very much so.<br />Well worth the purchase price-you'll get at least three reads out of it.  I'm keeping on eye on Kennedy for his next project.  Let's hope he turns to fiction.	2003-10-02

Beemer is a hilarious tale of a journey through the Southern California world of media consultancy and related industries.  The story has some related nudges towards Max (Maxx) Barry's SYRUP, yet the writing is more towards Chuck Palahniuk or J.G. Ballard.  As he self describes: &quot;I lecture their CEOs and COOs and C-whatever-whatevers on the importance of sublime irony in marketing to twentysomethings, the clued-in earnestness of talking to teenagers, the subconscious product-placement opportunities of video games. I sell them manifestos on whatever detail of their global empire they're sweating at the moment...&quot;<br />As the story grows on, it becomes a tad crazier (Beemer's girlfriend becomes a publicist for a boy band made up of Eunuchs) and you really have to take what is going on with a grain of salt.<br />But the writing is marvelous and a fun, and even thought-provoking, read.

The story is about Steve (who insists he is not Steve) and the actions of his life through a media-plagued society.  The plot is relatively hard to grasp, in the same manner as Fight Club.  And similarly, Lipsyte's style of writing is very much in line with Fight Club's author Chuck Palahniuk.  Steve has a very edgy, driven rhythm to the prose and certainly entertains all along the way.<br />At times, the story becomes extreme as it dives into bizarre sexual experiences that certainly seem misplaced.  Overall, still worth a read.	2003-07-23

As anticipated, it is a hilarious book telling details of a Portland that most of us do not know.<br />Chuck describes all the things you can do in Portland but were afraid to ask (and even more afraid now that you know they exist.)  He even has a detailed map, listing items like \\"place where Chuck got beat up.\\")  Included are destails of the Vacuum Museum and haunted houses.  Particularly entertaining is the section of the sex industry in Portland, which seems to be the main industry if you read this book correctly.<br />The only thing missing are the tidbits of Chucks life (those little autobiographical items that would satisfy his loyal fans.)  It is still worth buying no matter what.  This is another great book from prolific Chuck!	2003-07-16

Joey Goebel may have just created a new type of literary genre-Punk Rock Literary.  The characters in this novel are so bizarre you might pass on the novel at the description, but I beg you to go forth and read!<br />The story involves the most insane group of rock band members one could ever conceive (a party maniac who happens to be a senior citizen and a nymphomiac?  A Middle Eastern fem?  An eight year old nihilist?).  C'mon - just the characters alone are worth the read.<br />I found the novel easy to read and enjoyed every moment.  This is great writing from an up and coming author.  For those of you who thought Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club was a book that couldn't be matched, read The Anomalies!  Buy this baby!	2003-04-29

The stories tell (the majority of) the life of Parker Hayes, starting at age thirteen at a little league baseball game through to his mid-thirties, all the while telling of his (lack of) readiness to handle the tasks of life, and more specifically, the task of landing the perfect woman.<br />Set in the 1970's and 1980's we see Parker grow from a child to a man, stumbling from one learning lesson to another (all in a hilarious manner), with each story thrown against the backdrop of the rock music of the days (msuic being his escape, we get a good dose of that backdrop).<br />The stories are written in a such a way that you will recall your own fumblings of youth and find yourself laughing with him along the way.  The female characters here (and there are many) tend be a tad stereotypical (and a tad repetitive) but the reader will quickly see Parker is drawn to the same types, doomed to repeat his mistakes.  It all builds to a comfortable closure and leaves you feeling content, and ready to start over and read it again.<br />An excellent read.  Well worth the cover price.	2003-03-27

The story moves nicely and will keep your attention.<br />This novel is overwhelming dark, but even the most disturbing scenes are overshadowed by frank and warm undertones.

Sadly, the tables turn and she is the victim of a gang rape.<br />The story will certainly capture your attention and the words flow smoothly.<br />However, the narration drags at some points, especially in the first 100 pages, and I found myself wishing she got to the point sooner.

Green Grass Grace has got to be one of most hilarious books I have picked up in years.  I haven't been this blown away by an adolescent protagonist since CATCHER IN THE RYE.<br />McBride tells the story of 13-year-old Henry Toohey and his childhood adventures in 1984 Philadelphia.  The book is both sharp and soft, as Henry's expletive-filled mouth tells a rather beautiful story of the search for love and hope within his Irish-American family.  His journey is entertaining enough but the wit with which the story is narrated makes it all worth while, maybe even more than the immortalized Holden Caufield (Holden would be unlikely to compose a sonnet to breasts--that should give you a flavor of what is going on here.)  The story is filled with surprises and treats that will have you laughing to yourself long after you've put the book down.<br />I hate it when I can't fine books this good in hardback; I've already read it three times.

Though I typically struggle with short story collections (Adam Haslett's &quot;You Are Not A Stranger Here&quot; excluded), this grouping is a phenomenal and delightfully surprising read.<br />The stories in Kelly Link's collection really touch on the elements of human life (more specifically--human suffering) and a quirky twist is added to each to take the ideas to a new level.  While the ideas are a tad extreme/odd (i.e. man has voluntary amputation to identify with the idea of loss) there is nothing here that should scare off more mainstream readers. Fans of Jonathan Lethem will like this collection.<br />Most notable stories include: Louise's Ghost,Most of My Friends are Two-Thirds Water, and Water Off a Black Dog's Back.  Keep an eye on this author for a full length novel.  Should Link be able to expand her story-telling to novels, you'll be looking at some seriously popular books.<br />Grab Stanger Things Happen.

Radiance, if you didn't know better, could sound a lot like a Tom Clancy novel (man works at nuclear lab, man finds invalid data, man blows whistle, etc.) but nothing could be further from the truth.  This book is all about the prose.<br />Reading previous reviews of this novel, you may be lead astray.  The story here is quite well developed, and Scholz's obvious knowledge of the Nuclear/Defense community seems quite valid.  But the story is told more as a pseudo-perspective of a data-stream mind.  Characters come and go, relationships come and go--some quite rapidly.  But even though this is a tale of manipulation and dominance, it is its lyrical content that makes it worth reading.<br />However - while the story keeps its grip through the unique story-telling, it seems labored and, at times, taken too far.  I had to read some pages a few times because the stream-of-consciouness riffs actually made me drone out.<br />It's worth reading, and worth noting Scholz as a writer who not only shows great promise, but may define a new style in the upcoming years.	2003-02-04

But each chapter thereafter gets duller, more mundane, and - especially in the last 100 pages - downright inane.<br />I don't doubt Ms. Sebold's talent as a writer, but it seems obvious she had no idea how to end the book - and still doesn't.<br />One other note: you need to be able to handle metaphors that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Doesn't Little Brown have editors anymore?  I can only hope whoever writes the screenplay (I assume this is going to film) will rewrite the second half of the story.	2002-10-29

But what a bizarre and hilarious ride it is!<br />From page one I was hooked and couldn't let go.  Lord Vishnu's Love Handles is a story about a man holding on to the last threads of his sanity as he realizes, more and more, that he has visions and learns of things he should not (and could not) know.  The narrative is strong and keeps the pace rolling nicely.  I actually found myself wanting more when the story was over (@220 pages is like eating tapas--I'm never full).<br />As a reader who normally does not enjoy &quot;fantasy-like&quot; or impossible elements to stories, I was easily pulled in to the plot line of this story (in the same way you may be pulled in to the impossibility of Chuck Palahniuk's Lullaby).  Fans of Chucky P. or Dave Eggers will dig this.<br />The writing is edgy, quirky and a blast!  Too bad I couldn't find it in hardback - this one is a keeper.	2002-10-16

This is where Holden Caufield would have ended up had he remained a young man for fifty years.

And, on an entertainment level, this book produces, and produces big.  My first reading of a Chuck Palahnuik novel (advocates tell me I made a big mistake by not starting with either Fight Club or Survivor) and I am hooked on his style.  He writes with a sarcsatic tongue that, while it could be considered excessive, never fails to induce an audible giggle.<br />However--he was way off on his subject matter.  The topic of a true sex addict going to sexaholic meetings to hook up with women makes as much sense as an alcoholic going to an AA meeting to get hammered.  Chuck should have at least interviewed a few men and women who attend these meetings to through some authenticity into the mix.  His characters are bizarre, which is fine, but the outside world should still stay in balance--otherwise you are now writing science fiction.<br />That said, it is a good read, and it will keep the pages turning.  Not for those with a shy eye to sex or those who hate depressing narrative.	2002-09-19

Why do we all keep adding our opinions even though we know they'll be buried in the abyss?<br />Read this book and you'll see why.<br />Holden Caufield, our protagonist, speaks as honestly and openly as the youth of our culture today.  This book could have been written a year ago and you'd likely never know.  The satirical bite of the main character rings true to your soul and when you finish the last page, you're either sorry it's over and you go back to page one and start over again.  This is one of the original page-turners.	2002-08-22

For all those guys who wished they could have been Richard Gere in American Gigolo, you should pick up a copy of this book; it will dash your indulgent fantasies.<br />\\"Chicken\\" tells Sterry's story of family dejection and his fast leap into the freakish world of prostitution.  On the journey, he mentions various strange meetings and requests of his \\"clients\\"--but don't be too anxious to believe these vignettes will tantalize.  It's obvious Sterry is speaking from the heart and instead of exciting me (I didn't expect it to) this well-written book made my stomach turn.  Even with all the mentioning of orgies and sexual conduct, you can still sense the young boy whose life is being destroyed.<br />The prose is beautifully, albeit aggressively, written.  And other than a few anachronisms (were there really pagers in the seventies?) you can't help but love this book.  One of the best I have read this year.<br />And as you read Sterry's book--and I highly suggest you do--you can't help but hear the echo of what the author calls instruction #8: If something seems weird, it probably is.	2002-08-22

Twelve compares to Less Than Zero in many ways: the drugs, the sex, even the authors were young adults when they wrote the novels.<br />I am always in search of the great protagonist-driven literature and this was not it.  Not bad for a first effort, it comes off overcompensating in the angst department.  And after a while it started to grate on my nerves.  I felt the McDonell was trying to hard at the despair thing, or that he really is down and out.	2002-08-13

It's an interesting combo for sure, and Ellis brings it off nicely.  Not as painful to read as American Psycho, it still has the edgy angst that most Ellis lovers long for.<br />The book definitely captured my attention and I found it hard to put down.  But is it me, or is each of Bret's novels slipping by about 10 percent?  Less Than Zero still seems the most acute work of his career.<br />But whether you like or dislike Victor Ward as the model/maniac, you have to admit Ellis's writing is fun to read.  It's witty, surprising and cutting edge.  I laughed out loud too often to try and read it in bed with my wife.  Pick it up in paperback.	2002-07-02
