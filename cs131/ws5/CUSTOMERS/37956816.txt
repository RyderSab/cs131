US	37956816	R3MERVNH64J1NR	044651652X	879659950	The Bridges of Madison County	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Heartfelt	I finished reading this book about twenty minutes ago and started writing this while the book was still fresh in my mind, in my soul.  I?m not going to get into what the book is about because I think most everyone already knows that, so I?ll disband with the redundancies. I?ve been hearing about The Bridges of Madison County for several years now, first heard about it when I was at a seminar at Presbyterian College in South Carolina. Finally, I read Stephen King?s book about writing and King stated that this book was a terrible book.  So, out of curiosity, I decided to finally give Bridges a read. Though I?ve always liked King?s work and admired the man for what he?s done, I think he better read this book again.  My favorite mainstream writer has always been Ernest Hemmingway.  In this text, I enjoyed the simplicity of a heartfelt story told, the same as Hemmingway always affected me.  If you like to read something that will grab you in the heart, read The Bridges of Madison County.  I thought this was a very good novel.	2004-07-22

The writer has a very vivid grasp on his audience and what they enjoy.  Within this novel, Van Helsing makes a life of chasing monsters.  Anything from werewolves to vampires.  Van Helsing is a mysterious character even to himself.  He doesn't remember his beginnings, but he finds out when he meets Count Dracula.  The Frankenstein monster is finally given his just place in fiction.  Never a dull paragraph, this writer keeps you reading and entertained.  You gotta' read it!	2004-07-05

The writing itself is well done but the characterization was so intense that I finished it feeling tense.  I've read other stuff by this same writer and this book was no doubt one of his earlier books.  A man implants an alien element into a small girl which causes her to take on and cure other people's diseases. The characters make a few wild character changes.  Worth a read, though.	2004-07-05

He's aced the popular fiction markets for years, but within this book I think I received a peep of Stephen King. With all his success, he's still retains a bit of the regular &quot;Joe&quot; sort of a guy. And as he promised, this book is not just another book of BULL to sell to wanna' be writers.	2004-05-07

I enjoyed it from the first to last word. It's not genre fiction for sure. Hemingway tells one man's battle in life as it often truly occurs. The protagonist achieves his goal, but the elements of nature take the most from him. Great fiction! I think, sometimes, I see a hint of this writer's dynamic impact of simplicty within the pages of today's popular genre novels.<BR>Hell, Old Man And The Sea won a Pulitzer!	2004-05-07

But, I noticed several dangling modifiers and in paragraphs I noticed that the author picked up on a particular word and used that word several times.  Also, this author used the word &quot;some&quot; repeatidly.  Then again, &quot;some&quot; people might not notice these things and the book is a good read, no doubt about it, but not five stars for the above mentioned reasons.  Also, the author has a tunnel dug through rock under a river for three hundred feet leading to a concealed room. When the room is opened, the novel's characters later find that there's another door leading out into a cemetary.  Why would anyone drill through three hundred feet of rock to a room that has another door leading out?  Beats me.	2004-01-15
US	37956816	R21QMOVCLHUYQ8	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Among The Best!	I found this novel very interesting.  In interesting, I mean I couldn't wait to get back to it when I had to close its pages to do something else.  Time travel was given a fictional explanation which, as far as I'm concerned, is as lucid as any fictional theory can be. I've had college level physics and chemistry and I went for all except the pits in the glass filter walls. But then again the method used to repair these tanks might have worked, but I doubt it, as being on the outer surface, the pits would be in tension, where on the inner surface the pits would be in compression-the tension is the most critical.  Meaning, when filled with water, the force from the water's weight would be greatest on the surface. I don't think the method of repair would have stopped this.  No biggy, just thought I'd say a word or two.  <br />I got a vivid \\"view\\" of all the characters, the settings. Though this writer's style in no way is like Hemmingway, he does rate with Hemmingway in that he told a clear story with simple writing-no prissy, \\"tiptoeing through the tulips\\" writing. His research into medieval times had to have been extensive as even the tiniest detail seems to be as it should.<br />What I hated most about this novel was when I came to the end and knew I'd rarely experience such strong entertainment again.	2003-12-21

Not confusing and boring, but a thing where a person's mental state has decayed and the paranormal is involved as well. It seems most the novels that I read lately are noteworthy, and this one is no exception. Its ending leaves the reader wondering, but yet knowing. Actually, it's almost like an exploded version of Virginia Wolfe's story, The Haunted House. Creepy, but not gory. Again, as in other works I've read lately, the publisher has done a poor job of proofreading. Again, no big deal. I found this novel to be a satisfying and mellow read.	2003-11-21
US	37956816	R3LWEMX0WKBRPZ	0843952407	810038697	The Doorkeepers	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Great Writing	This novel is a strong five stars.  The writing is smooth and moves along without dragging.  From the beginning to the end, never a dull paragraph.  Doorkeepers involves one man's inadvertent involvement with people in parallel worlds.  The main character enters these worlds in his search for his sister's killer.  He discovers a few friends and a bookoo of enemies.  The writer, however, should give the publisher a strong word or two for allowing a few typos to remain.  Not the writer, but the publisher ought to be ashamed.  I'd give this novel more than five stars if possible.  I've heard of this writer, but this is the first of his work that I've read.  I understand now why he carries a very good reputation. He certainly deserves it.	2003-11-07
US	37956816	RLWNIN9CIIHIS	0843952180	453244711	Darkfall	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Intense Writing	With this novel we have a horror I haven't run across before. Something new is always great. The author did a fine job with his characters.  The total time span of this novel takes place in one night and it's a fairly long novel, as novels go.  I gave 4 stars because the author stayed in the building's stairwells too long. Also, it might be a British versus American thing, but he changed character viewpoints without any hint of doing so. Nevertheless, I finished the novel. I enjoyed it.	2003-10-27

A man and his family move to a new area. The house they move into happens to be the center for a breed of demons that show themselves as shadows. Ever think you see something move from the corner of your eye and when you look, it's not there?  Kinda' like that only these shadows sometimes alowed themsevles to be seen.  This novel was a smooth read.  Surely worth a read!	2003-10-27

The same as in real life, the characters don't suspect a vampire is in the works as, the same as in real life, who would suspect such a thing.  If someone told them, they would probably laugh, but before this novel is over, no one is laughing.<br />The vampire has it in for one of the main characters and the vampire does everything he can to destroy this man mentally before attacking him physically. <br />Worth a read.	2003-05-31

This writer's style is good and in this novel, his characterization is great.  The characterization more or less carries the novel.  Not five stars, though.  I thought the conflict, which I won't mention here to spoil it for potential readers, is a more than an overworked conflict.  Good writing, though. Never a dull moment.  Worth a read.  I start reading many books and put down many after the first ten or so pages.  I read this one through.  A strong four stars!	2003-05-26

That's how much I enjoyed it.  The writing is smooth, unpretentious.

The prologue is the best I think I've ever read anywhere, as far as getting the reader ready for the ride. Everybody loves haunted house stories.  This one is a very good one.  I liked The Haunting-I know a lot of people like it as well.  This is The Haunting with teeth.  In this novel, the reader is shown the terrors.  Perhaps the bogies might rival Lovecraft.  One thing for sure, this writer has not shortchanged anyone in creating this book.  I won't be surprised to see a movie made from The Infinite.  As for that, I think I'll be surprised if a movie isn't made.  What can I say?	2002-10-26

Though there was no supernatural horror, the real horror this writer brought into focus served just as well.  I found myself being able to identify clearly with the main character-his ideas and feelings on things.  Suspense was not lacking here at all.  I kept turning pages wanting to know what happened next.   If you wanna' read a fine book-read this one!	2002-10-21

I'm American and I say American Horror writers should read this to get an idea of what the true horror reader likes.

The author uses minor supernatural elements to bring forth situations that could very easily happen in real life.  Sort of time travel via the supernatural but with a more serious twist.  Also, one can easily see how time should not be delved with.  The past should be left to the past.  Let the dead bury the dead and let the living continue.   Well worth the time taken to read.  Great story line.	2002-08-25

This novel has two seperate stories, Red and Passenger.  Both are great.  In Red, Jack Ketchum shows his own knowledge of a person's feelings for their pet.  Again, in Passenger, he shows his knowledge of good and bad.  I don't think I read one paragraph that was a bore.  Both stories stand high in my standard.  I read a short story by this author once, and I knew then he was one of the best.	2002-08-11
