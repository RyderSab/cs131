This time, we find out what happened to the rest of the world after Nantucket Island disappeared in the \\"Island in the Sea of Time\\" series. Suddenly electricity doesn't work, explosives don't explode, and even steam engines don't steam. More spoilers follow, so if you don't want to know... <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the changes imply magic more than a change in physical laws. Why is life still possible without electricity? Why won't internal combustion engines combust, since gasoline still burns? Why won't steam engines at least explode when run over-pressure? <br /> <br />In this foray into the collapse of civilization, Stirling focuses on two groups of survivors, each of which has literally astronomical luck in the skills their members just happen to have. The focus on Wicca in one group adds nothing to the story, and wastes an awful lot of space. <br /> <br />Stirling's saving grace is that he writes about likable characters. Unfortunately, it seems that this is going to be part of another multiple-book series whose only justification is to pad the author's income. Unless you need to kill some time, there is little other reason to embark on this series.	2005-09-28

There is so much wasted space between the covers, that when the climax finally comes near the very end, it's hard to remember who some of the players are. The climax seems rushed, as if someone had to meet a publisher's deadline or some such. The ending itself is just a bit too convenient and a bit too cryptic. <br /> <br />There are some scenes with the mysterious Bane Sidhe (hint, this is pronounced Banshee in English), but we really learn nothing useful about the group. Nor is there any meaningful detail about what has been happening since the cavalry arrived (aka the Fleet) and ended the Posleen incursion on Earth in one afternoon (slight exaggeration), some forty years earlier. <br /> <br />If you skip this entry in Aldenata series, you won't notice the omission. Speaking of which, when the heck are we going to find out more about the Aldenata, and learn who engineered the Posleen (they can't be natural), and why?	2005-09-28

Kratman presents a brave Texas standing alone against the evil federal government, after being provoked beyond tolerance by events that even include a recreation of the Alamo, complete with multiple references to the deguello!     The story is are dragged along, with the only real question being why it takes the Army and the Marines as long as it does to follow the Air Force's example.     The entire effort seems to have been designed just to let the author present a series of \\"proposed\\" constitutional amendments, parts of which are guaranteed to offend just about everyone. Limiting federal sprawl, and RKBA sentiments are just fine, but Kratman is no Heinlein or Pournelle, or even an L. Neil Smith.	2005-08-07

The Road To Damascus (the title being a New Testament reference) has some of this style, but it is also a bit off. The Bolo's internal reflections, which are central to any Bolo story, don't come off quite right. Although \\"Sonny\\", the Bolo, is _only_ a Mark XX (the first fully self-aware series), he has almost no personality. Also, Bolos rarely take more than hundredths of a second to run analysis and programs. For some reason, the authors have Sonny sometimes needing tens of seconds.    Ringo and Evans are both experienced authors, who manage to drag this saga through some 750 pages, at least a third of which could be dropped without a loss. I didn't think authors were paid for novels by the word. Worse, the ending is a bit unfinished, and I really hope this doesn't mean there will be a sequel for Unit SOL-0045 of the Line.    Finally, the political premise at the core of the story makes no sense. There are some references to Second Amendment issues, and some analogies with Nazi use of scapegoats as an politically unifying tool. But why would a pair of rich heirs to an industrial empire undertake to engineer and pull off the complete destruction of a planetary economy and its society? If they wanted to fill their pockets, a working industrial base would yield more takings. The concept provides an unequivocable set of \\"bad guys\\", but it doesn't hold up to scrutiny.	2005-07-17

Yet this was reality in the 1940s military, when blacks were not allowed in combat units, filipinos were only mess attendants, and woman were drivers and typists. Homosexuals were at best shunned. The real issue in the story is that the modern contingent is a bit too smoothly integrated. <br /> <br />When I first saw the back cover blurb, I thought it was going to be a ripoff of \\"The Final Countdown,\\" but Birmingham takes quite a different path. The issue of merging a 21st century naval battle group with a navy that is almost at 19th century technology levels is one he starts to approach, but actually puts off for the sequel. By which time the newcomers will have expended most of their ammunition and other consumables. There is a twist at the end when Yamamoto makes a stunning, and brilliant strategic move. <br /> <br />P.S. The edition I read (not the one listed here) could have used better editing. Names and ranks are sometimes out of sync with who is in the room, which is annoying and confusing.	2005-06-18

The book consists of four novellas (novelettes?), the first three of which involve the same core characters. The stories are mediocre. The fourth story needs a major re-write. It is confused, illogical, and inconsistent. Too bad, since the first three stories span the entire First War, and could have been enlightening.    FWIW, the spelling errors seem to have been corrected in the paperback edition.    SPOILERS:    Colebatch grants two major new abilities to the Kzin. He tells us that all Kzinti have an empathic sense, and the ability to see in almost total darkness. Unless my memory is failing, these are new abilities. On Earth, species rarely have more than two sharp senses, let alone four. What's worse, having bestowed empathic abilities on the Kzin, he makes no use of them.    In the fourth story, there is a cameo by some Thrintun. Why? Having live Thrint in the story for 30 seconds makes no difference to anything. Why is the finale of the story never mentioned in any other Known Space tale? It certainly would have had a huge impact on everyone.    Colebatch also introduces a new sentient species native to Wunderland. Did everyone else overlook them before? The species is in a niche that makes their evolution highly improbable too.	2005-05-17

First come the opening setting, a couple thousand years uptime, a paradise with virtually unlimited energy and computing power available, teleportation, and nanotechnology to build or change anything on command. Then he pulls the rug out from everything with a ludicrous \\"war\\" between ruling council members. The entire population is dropped into fourteenth century technology, except for said council members who still have all their techno-magical means. Firearms aren't allowed due to a lame excuse he has, but elves, dwarves, orcs, dragons and unicorns are provided on an equally lame basis. Even Sluggy Freelance gets dragged in! The characters are shallow, and the plot is nothing more than a series of little episodes. Some of the main characters don't even rise to the level of being \\"shallow\\". Finally everything culminates in a battle that is so baldly staged and manipulated for the author's convenience that its offensive to the reader.<br /><br />If you want a sword and sorcery tale, pick one that is at least honest with itself.	2004-12-08

In this case, he has a group of Maranos living in the 21st century Third Reich. This was originally a short story, and worked better and more poignantly in that form. The expanded version is only mildly interesting, with way too much focus on one character's dysfunctional marriage. <br /> <br />There are also some cutesy corrolaries with current history. The story starts with a Fuhrer is named Kurt Haldweim (Kurt Waldheim). There is a coup attempt while the new Fuhrer is on vacation in the Crimea (Gorbachev). The leader of Czechoslovakia is a former playwright (Vaclav Havel). One of the satellite countries' new political party is called Unity (Solidarity). And so on. Probably some more that I missed. <br /> <br />While this is not a bad book, it doesn't compare well to \\"A Different Flesh\\" let alone to \\"Guns of The South\\". There is no new ground here. At least he keeps the shifting viewpoints down to just a few characters this time. <br /> <br />If you are looking for something unchallenging to pass the time, its OK. If you have something better to read, give this a pass.	2004-11-12

John Ringo seems to be taking lessons from Weber on how to stretch a plot on, and on, and on, and on. The characters in this installment go from scenario to scenario, repeating what has gone on several times before. There is no logic, no suspense, or even much enthusiasm to be drummed up. Then, when they finally get to make the assault that all three volumes have been leading up to, it turns out to be a complete anti-climax. To make it worse, Ringo and Weber use it to set up what looks to be an entirely new set of entries in the series, to be continued ad nauseum. <br />Science fiction is supposed to explore _new_ frontiers. But unless you plan to just turn of your brain and any crtical faculties, there is absolutely nothing new here.	2004-04-25

The author tries to follow the life of an orphan (by implication the Warchild) as he passes through various environments. But she seems to keep forgetting that he is (as things progress) eight to fourteen years old. The novel is presented from this characters viewpoint, and his thoughts and observations are usually much to adult if you really think about them. <br />Not a bad first outing, but not great either.	2003-10-24

By itself, that label might not be a condemnation, but this entry into the Dune saga is one of the sorriest attempts to milk a series that I've ever seen. <br />The designated evil in the book, Omnius the cybernetic evermind and its cronies are complete cretins that provide no credibility at all. A troop of developmentally challenged boy scouts could outwit these cardboard creations.<br />The way each of the planets in the book is presented, it seems to have a total population of about 200. Science Fiction normally doesn't deal well with realistic populations, but this is worse then the way Star Trek does it. <br />Of the three main characters, only Serena Butler seems to have any depth. The Harkonen and Atreides representatives have about as much substance as Shakespeare's Rosencrantz and Guidenstern.<br />The authors display a complete lack of understanding of spatial relationships, science, technology, and all matters military. In the past some of this didn't matter, because the earlier books used the Guild to instantly transit from one planet to another. But since in this book they have to travel in the real Universe, they trip all over themselves with inconsistencies and improbabilities. Frank Herbert himself wisely avoided trying to explain the technologies he introduced, and never tried to handle conventional military maneuvers. But Anderson and the younger Herbert try and make a complete hash of both.<br />This book unfortunately fills a critical place in the Dune chronology. That is does it so badly is a crime. Can I give it less than one star?	2003-10-24

It is set entirely in the time of Shakespeare and Elizabeth, and the &quot;What If&quot; premise is that the Spanish Armada successfully reached England. All the dialog is in psuedo Elizabethan English, so if you had any trouble reading Shakespeare in high school, you will be completely lost here. Turtledove cribs large pieces of period free-verse from several authors, which just adds to the opacity of the work.<br />Scholars might find hidden references and interesting constructs, but most readers will miss any and all historical notes. <br />The writing itself is decent, and for a relief Turtledove only alternates between two characters (Shakespeare and a spanish military officeer/playwright), unlike much of his reecent work which seem to all include huge casts. But the plot is lame, and the ending implausible.	2003-09-24

Such is the case with the Excalibur Alternative. Although David Weber has written many notable volumes, this is a piece of schlock that is best avoided. Weber describes in his forward how this book began life as a short story, and it would have been better if it had stayed one. The middle 60% of the novel is nothing but filler, where the main character endlessly lectures on things to convey little additional information. Unless you need something to read on an airline flight and then throw away, look for one of Weber's other works instead.	2003-05-17

Weber takes 864 pages to move the plot forward about a short stories worth. All the characters spend their time telling each other everthing that has gone before, and it's not until the last 100 pages or so that anything of substance actually happens!

Unfortunately, the one he chose to write goes out of its way to be as miserable as possible. The main protagonists are a completely disfunctional family, with three sons who try to be as obnoxious as possible. Gerrold stresses this through the first third of the book, tne makes attempts to portray them as more likeable. By the time you get to this point, you would gladly turn them all over to the bad guys, except there aren't any bad guys!<br />The best feature of the book is when the author gets into engineering details of the Beanstalk, which is the milleu in which most of the story occurs. The look into the repurcussions that would result if a completed Beanstalk were severed high up are fascinating. But its a side show, and not enough to support the story.<br />Most disappointing is the conclusion. Gerrold arbitrarily jerks all the characters around to produce a Nero Wolfe style \\"Let's get all the players into the parlor\\" climax. But there is no climax, just a [weak] attempt to pin all the threads together.<br />Go read something else :(	2001-09-27

There is little evidence of Niven's hand anywhere in this piece, and none of his meticulous attention to detail, thought out consequences, or neatly tied conclusions. A few Niven-esque technologies are referenced (electric sleep and food yeast), but that's about it.<br />The plot revolves around a hidden master villan. But the discovery of his existence is lame, the steps to cover the discovery implausible (in that the destruction used is so nicely limited), and the eventual identity of the enemy is unsupported by a decent evidence trail.<br />The story lurches along with direction and venue changes that seem completely arbitrary. For example, the year plus interlude with the natives in Java adds nothing but pages. There are lots of concepts in the book that could be interesting if exploited, but none are really followed through.<br />Niven's last several efforts haven't really been up to his prime work, but this may be the most disappointing.	2001-06-17

In a role reversal from Tom Pain Maru and the other works of the probability broach, in Forge we find that the humans are the unenlightened, bureaucracy laden &quot;primitives&quot;, and the aliens are the wise, libertarian, anrachistic souls. The term alien fits only loosely, since the one hundred or more species represented are all from alternate Earths! <br />The problem with this piece is that it is about three times as long as it should be. Smith introduces some twists and turns, but they are almost pointless as he endlessly lectures on politics and ethics.<br />Even if you agree with the philosophies espoused here, the incessant repetition grows old.	2001-05-15

Each new chapter pulls rabitts out of the hat that have little or no  foundation laid for them. The central mystery can be guessed by a nine year  old before you are halfway through the book.

While he doesn't completely succeed, even a near miss by Vinge is better then a lot of others can do.    Deepness is set in the same universe as \\"A  Fire Upon the Deep\\", but predates it, probably by thousands of years.      The planet and star system used a as setting are novel and fascinating.    The human culture that Vinge introduces along side his Qeng  Ho traders is called the Emergency (as in emergence, not as in crisis), and  this is one of the things that doesn't quite hit the target. Human  interactions change course for little reason, and too many of the  characters are merely spear carriers.     The alien race introduced, the  Spiders, come off as merely people in eight-legged suits. There is nothing  really alien about the way they are presented, though this is something  rarely pulled off by anyone other than Larry Niven. Particularly vexing is  their completely unexplained rate of technological progress, which while  essential to the plot otherwise makes no sense.    The book seems like it  could have used another pass through the editor, and maybe to be put aside  for a time and then tightened up by the author. Nevertheless, it's woth  reading for Vinge fans and others.	2000-02-21

I picked it up because I'd been so impressed with Zebrowski's collaboration on the Killing Star, but this was a complete disappointment.<br />The alleged plot starts  out with some similarities to Norton's Time Trader's series, where humans  discover ancient starships buried on Earth. The difference here is that the  time travel is between different realities, instead of linearly through  historic time. A group of miserable excuses for scientists start to  explore, and the plot completely derails. Threads start and die with no  discernable plan.

The plot begins when one of the first contact alien visitors is arrested on incredibly lame justification (i.e. he -along  with 25 others- had opportunity). Next, Sawyer violates the first rule of a  good murder mystery, and an essential requirement when mixing it with SF;  the author _must_ supply the reader with all the information to solve the  crime. But Sawyer pulls religious and cultural motivations out of thin air  to explain things after the fact. Furthermore, the aliens are lame (media  reviews of the book notwithstanding), and their anatomy is incredibly  improbable (they can only bring one arm to bear, unless a item is over  their heads.) Although the weapon used is one of Larry Niven's favorite  tools, the calibre of this story doesn't even approach Niven's SF mystery  stories. Sawyer's endless plugs for Canada get pretty old too. And finally,  isn't an illeagle a sick bird?	1999-01-10
