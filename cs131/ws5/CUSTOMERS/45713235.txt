A sparkling, beautiful story of life & death, and the entities that exist between. I was enchanted from the first few sentences; this author writes w/ such eloquence, you feel you're really there. <br />This is not your ordinary sappy story of a parent/child bond. It's much more subtle, which, to me, makes the book more compelling. I couldn't put it down & am sad that I've finished it. <br />I cannot wait to read more of Livesay. I think I might savor this book for a while before I pick up another. <br />	2005-10-13

Granger just has this certain 'way' of really pulling the reader into the novel. <br />It's told from Zelda's point of view. Set in London amidst WWII, Granger intricately weaves us a tale of family & neighbors within the quaint, zany community of Paradise Gardens. Everyone is in everyone else's business & there's never a dull moment within the confines of Paradise Gardens. <br />Lol, I am learning so much about UK/London dialect from reading her novels!  <br />This is a charming novel that preceeds the story from \\"..Tarts..\\".	2005-10-11

I enjoyed it very much. Yes, the plot can be a tad predictable, but I love her dialogue between characters. As my title notes, she reminds me of Maeve Binchy, another British novelist. I read a few of Binchy's, but haven't picked hers back up in a couple of years. I tend to prefer more \\"meat\\" to my novels. Wickham's style is a light, easy style to breeze through. It was especially comforting as I had recently finished a dramatic memoir. <br />Not to blab on, but I'd like to mention another British author: Pip Granger. She is wonderful! I am about to start my second novel of hers. Try \\"Not All Tarts Are Apple\\" by Granger if you enjoyed this book. A bit more drama, with loads of laughter & zaniness.	2005-09-24

Ok, you know the premise: Max is born looking like he's 70 & he basically ages backwards. The novel is well-written; Greer just has a way with words. The story is a very odd tale of love & examines our own selfish wants & needs. You can't help feeling sorry for Max & I wonder- did anyone grow to despise Alice like I did??  <br />There's no huge mysteries in this book, but its odd tale keeps you turning the pages. I enjoyed it thoroughly, simply because it was an unusual tale of love, love lost, & found again.	2005-09-10

Rose is married nearly 25 years to her adoring husband, Nathan, when she finds out he's leaving her for a much younger woman. This woman also happens to be Rose's assistant! Rose is completely poised throughout the novel, amidst anguish, hurt, betrayal, & loss. Yet through pain & grief, she manages to hold onto herself & realizes that all is not lost. <br />I don't want to give anything away- just read! The only pitfall to this novel is that it's classic British vocab. I suppose I need to study up on my British more before I read her again.  <br />A very refreshing, true, elegant writer. I can easily see how this was a bestseller in the UK.	2005-08-25

I really rate this 3.5 stars, only because the novel surrounds the life of writers, and frankly, they bore me. They ramble incessantly, are full of ego, and whine, whine, whine. (NOTE: Obviously I am referring to the typical, stereotype & realize that there are many writers who are exceptions to this.) Where was I? Oh- whining. Hence Joe Castleman, whom I almost immediately despised from the first few pages. He takes & takes & takes from anyone he can, including his wife, the quarterback of never-ending gifts to him. I really enjoyed Wolitzer's portrayal of their marriage & family life. She's got a knack for really humanizing these characters, rendering them touchingly fallible. <br />I did like the ending, too. It takes a little turn, reminding me of our real lives. It wasn't an ideal ending for me though; I wanted some healing or solace for Joan, the wife. Somehow though, the book suggests that she'll be fine on her own as she always was. <br />Yes, the book was enjoyable truly. I just wish there wasn't so much \\"blah blahs\\" about writers & their worlds. Then again, I suspect Wolitzer couldn't have gotten her story across. I hope to read more of her, where her characters hopefully choose different career paths. :)	2005-08-19

Both were equally amazing. This book, much like Brilliant, has it all: romance, mystery, seduction, fine wine & dining, & breathtaking descriptions of jewels & jewelry to name a few. Kick is a woman after my own heart. Simply alone, her love of jewelry was enough to keep me spellbound. Never have I read a character to whom I can relate to as easily as with her in that sparkling respect. One sentence from Priceless reads as follows: \\"I can only describe the pleasure and warmth I receive from jewelry as intense, intimate, erotic.\\" <br />Don't get me wrong- this book doesn't just rant about jewels. The mystery itself is deliciously, slowly unveiled & Kellogg has skillfully rendered it so until you literally cannot put it down. The majority of the story takes place in lovely Portofino & Kellogg has obviously done her homework. Minute details decribe fine wines, scrumptous food, famously beautiful hotels, and the inner circle of the world's elite of the elite. Oh, and did I mention the jewelry???!   **grin** <br />This book for anyone who is looking for an escape or merely a change in scenery. Kellogg will keep you entertained until the very last sentence of the last page!	2005-08-17

Becky is hilarious amidst all her antics & drama. &lt;laughing to myself even now> I must say there are some seriously funny parts in this one. The horse she takes with her shopping is one of my favs. <br />Can't say enough about this book or the series alone. If you haven't tried the series, this one is fine to start with, as each book gives background from the beginning. Eventually though, it would be ideal to read \\"Confessions Of A Shopaholic\\" & go down the series from there. <br />I am so enamored with adorable Becky. Reading this series gives me a much needed break from reality! <br />Grab this quickly- you will not be disappointed! Also excellent for a gals bookclub!	2005-08-15

I cannot imagine someone reading this book & giving it less then 5 stars. This happened to her!! How dare someone criticize her responses to it. I applaud every inch of this book. She bravely describes minute details of her horrifying ordeal & the long, sorrowful aftermath. What a lesson we learn from her bravery. She didn't let the attack cripple her. She rose above it & became stronger because of it! She is a remarkable person & after having read this, I have the utmost respect for her as a woman.	2005-08-10

You find yourself wincing at the abusive language & physical violence these characters all endure. Yet, something shines below the surface in this story. Granted, you may have to get a shovel & start digging for it, but all the better. I love reading a novel that teaches me something. Well, this one taught me to always be true to yourself, to always listen to that inner voice, and never to doubt for a second that you're worthy of love.  <br />I became enchanted with Avocet (\\"Bird\\") & would even like to see a sequel of her further adventures. <br />This book reminded me a lot of \\"The Secret Life Of Bees\\" which I also loved! <br />	2005-08-10

We remain in these women's shoes just watching it all unfold. Haigh captures the essence of women & how we think within these pages.

I am the only reviewer thus far to give a rating less than 5 stars! Perhaps I need to be in a different place in my life with my children grown to really get it. Or, to have left a love behind not by choice, but from forced events. <br />I adored the tale of Lee's grandmother Marguerite & their odd, yet endearing relationship to one another. <br />I was romanticized (obviously!) by Lee's thoughts to re-visit her first love if given the chance. Not only does she think fondly of \\"what if\\", she conspires & makes those events take place. <br />I think Medwed is a really good writer, but I was so bothered by Lee's callousness towards her loving husband, and, in a way, Simon, too, that I'd feel funny giving this 5 stars. I grew tired of the way Lee would try & rationalize & justify her behavior in that poor-pitiful-me-stance. Her husband remained steadfast until the very end. Speaking of ending- that had to confirm my 3 stars! I won't give anything away, but I'm just thinking: \\"How many times do you have to run face-first into the glass window before you realize the damn thing's double-paned & locked to boot?!!\\" <br />I am curious as to find another reader who shares my opinions on this book. Is there something I missed here to make it great, worthy of the 5 stars?? <br />In this genre of fiction, I would recommend Anita Shreve's \\"Resistance\\" instead of this. It's a complex, star-crossed love story set in painful, turbulent times.	2005-08-01

But pick it up @ your local bookstore & start with the first page. My guess is that you'll eagerly buy it & find it hard to put down.  <br />It's great reading such liberating literature.

The book certainly is beguiling & whisks you up & away immediately. I must say I also learned some new vocab from those crazy Brits. Call me dumb, but I didn't know what they were referring to at first when they'd use the word \\"tart\\"!  <br />Rosie is an adorable little character. So loveable, you find yourself feeling she's real, & think about her when you're not reading the book. (A sign of a great book is not only does it capture your thoughts while reading it, but when you put it down.) <br />I can't wait to read more of Rosie's further adventures in Granger's next novel. <br />	2005-07-25

I didn't realize that this was an autobiography. It reads like fiction. I know very little about the magazine world, but I have a distinct feeling that Carter really showed us an inside peek into it. I had a little trouble keeping up with all the friends, colleagues, loves, etc., so I just concentrated & listened beyond that. I really enjoyed reading Carter's upbeat attitude on life. Yes, she's definitely an optimist and no, that doesn't automatically classify you as silly or stupid. All the curves that life has thrown this woman, it'd be easy to let them all  blanket her in despair. Yet, Carter only gained strength & wisdom at each point.  <br />A few people have mentioned they had a hard time following b/c of the way she moves from past to present so frequently. If you can relax  & really immerse yourself in the book, you won't even notice that. Obviously, she did that for affect & wanted readers to get the \\"full circle\\" feel of her story. <br />I liked the book very much. A real slice of life. I love the way she has handled everything. I wish Ms. Carter much happiness & hope readers pick this book up & are inspired by her as I've been.	2005-01-04

I just couldn't help but have a difficult time in finding a lot of originality within the pages. <br />I wanted it funnier & there are parts I think could've been, but simply fizzled. I found it particularly amusing when our heroine went back home for a visit & had to share the same roof with her sister's many exotic, talking birds. <br />Not much stood out in this book. It was okay, but I was expecting at least a bit more boundary-pushing going on. Not just a home visit spent looking back on first loves then finally figuring out that your present home w/ hubby is not so bad.	2005-01-04

As my title notes, it reminded me very much of both hit shows. The characters Liv encounters in this book could only have come from a zany, neurotic Seinfeld episode. My favorite has to be her \\"Pat\\" boss, Dale. Belle's hilarious description of this wacky woman- from her trademark greeting of, \\"Hi, how aaaaare you?\\" to how she pronounces \\"ask\\" (\\"axe\\")- is just too funny & has me laughing out loud. You never know what's on the next page. Perhaps someone's falling from a second floor to the first in a bathtub in a restaurant or perhaps someone's getting their ear bitten off.  <br />The most romantic thing about this book (and, lol, the only I guess) is Liv's love of her city, New York. Obviously she reminds me of Carrie from Sex in that way. She gets plenty of crap thrown her way & people are not always there for her when she needs them, but her city always is & I smile thinking of her loyalty to it. The last sentence of the book is just plain neat & left me with a huge grin on my face.  <br />Read this crazy book! It goes beyond normal chick lit.	2005-01-04

I put off reading this book & had come to the conclusion that I didn't want to read a depressing nightmare of being locked in a remote prison for decades. Then along came a friend of a friend, who encouraged me to read it, that I \\"needed\\" to read it.<BR>This book, to me, was life-changing. As I recognize how spoiled us Americans truly are, nothing could've prepared me for this family's struggles.<BR>Malika & her family displayed such amazing gifts of courage & strength that I was blown away. In awe and humbled. Their \\"tale\\" was almost just that: a tale. I simply cannot fathom the conditions that these poor people survived in.<BR>As I was continuously mesmerized by their strength during their imprisonment, I was later caught in Malika's greatest feat of all: forgiveness. This woman showed me what a powerful thing it truly is. She forgave with such grace & eloquence that I was just speechless. I speak mainly of her due to the fact that she was \\"adopted\\" by the royal family as a child & later cast out in a most horrifying way. As us readers were not given as much detail of her siblings (especially after their release), I can make no assumptions for them. Nevertheless, this family as a whole is an unwavering symbol of love, strength, & survival.<BR>I hope that they are doing well now & thank each one of them for their story.<BR>I hope that I never forget it, for it is a daily reminder of what I have in this life with my freedom & my family.	2004-06-03

(Actually thirty one.)<br />I read this book about ten years ago. I was 18 at the time & from then on, greedily read all her novels (and poems) ever published. Jong taught me not to be ashamed of my sexuality, but to embrace being a woman and to go after what you want. At that time, I was conflicted, mainly because I was feeling so \\"open\\", but yet felt I should not venture out of my normal \\"good girl Baptist upbringing\\". I read her novels in secret, afraid of what others would think of me. Not long after this very book, I started to bloom into what was being stifled inside me all long.<br />I can now say that I am happily married with two young boys. I let myself roam freely & basically went after what I wanted & needed. I know that through that discovery is how I found my soulmate & developed love with all the sparks, too.<br />Take the time & read this classic & all her others. Keep an open mind & enjoy. My favorite thing about Jong is that she simply says all the \\"dirty\\" & \\"not-so-nice\\" things we women think of all the time. Such liberation to read her work!	2004-05-28

I love her candor. This book was very entertaining. The sex, as predicted, was good as always. The plot was not as imaginative & inventive as some of her other works. Nonetheless, it was still a pleasure to read. I feel anything Jong writes bares her signature style and with that in mind, it's always another handsome story to add to your collection.	2004-05-28

And let me say, you don't have to be a \\"shopaholic\\" to fully enjoy these books! (Psst! I hate shopping!) If you're not hooked with \\"Confessions..\\", try this anyway.<BR>I just find Kinsella's style of writing hilarious! Becky (our infamous heroine) is just too funny! Amidst all her hijinks with trying to hide her shopping, she is just so fun to watch squirm. She seems so real. Her dilemnas just might hit close to home for many of us. I saw symbolism in her shopping/trying-not-to-shop ordeal. I also was laughing out loud at the thought of someone salivating at the site of a Saks! Rofl...<BR>I am a married mom w/ two toddler boys & this trio of books I checked out from the library & read all within two weeks. (A lot of dedicated reading for a busy mom!)<BR>Can't say enough about this author....... eager to read \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\".	2004-05-27

She was clever to show so many characters' sides of this &amp; was constantly reminding us that there are two sides to every coin.<BR>I really flipped from four to three stars mainly because I feel so many aspects of this book's plot could've been explored much more. I would have loved to have heard Pagan's version of all this, especially after Lindy came back into the picture. I felt Pauline was abruptly removed when, if left, could've given this novel some really pivotal turns. Overall, I felt that after Tyler opened up all these little corridors, the book could've easily gone another 200+ pages to make it compelling. The image comes to mind of packing a suitcase really full, then finding you must dash quickly out the door, so you're sitting on that suitcase, trying, trying, to squash it together so the lock will catch.<BR>The ending tempted me to give it a well-deserved four stars, but I just couldn't shake the feeling of not getting the entire main course.<BR>This is the second novel I've read of hers and, yes, I'll read Tyler again. I really enjoy her style of writing &amp; her keen ability to take us into this enchanting, complex world of family and marriage.	2004-05-25

Really enjoyed it! So glad I read this, too. I really like her suspenseful twist she stirs into her plots.<BR>Saw others review it as a great beach or vacation read, and I must agree. You become swept up in the characters' lives &amp; find yourself thinking about them while you're not reading. <BR>There's a mix of things in this novel: compassion, enduring friendships, betrayal, suspense, and ohhh.... mystery!<BR>I also would recommend &quot;Whispers &amp; Lies&quot;, as it has similar twists like this one. (Also by Fielding.)	2004-05-24

I read it about seven years ago or so &amp; swore I wouldn't read her again. (In fact, I couldn't even finish the book before I threw it out, considering to burn it!) But alas, my curiosity took over &amp; here again, I am.<BR>OK, I could get through this. It wasn't draw-dropping shocking to me as &quot;...Alice&quot;, but interesting to say the least. My favorite thing about this book was its vast array of flawed characters. Yes, I was grinning &amp; laughing at times at the hilarity of it all. Probably more because of how this story mocked ordinary, american life. I don't think any of us can read this &amp; not be able to relate to it on some level.<BR>I only gave it three stars mostly because of the end. I closed the book feeling down, depressed, &amp; in need of a good scrubbing of my mind.<BR>Then again, I surmise this is exactly what Holmes wants to achieve from this book.	2004-05-20

The author is quite talented &amp; writes as if from another era. The prose is beautiful &amp; eloquent. <BR>I loved the setting &amp; enjoyed its Gothic content as well.<BR>I feel bad for giving it only three stars, but I must. I never felt settled after finishing it. It teases you thinking they'll find their happiness &amp; escape the bleakness, but no. <BR>It just depressed me, plain &amp; simple. I so wanted to find a deep satisfaction with this.<BR>It deserves my three because of such superb writing talent, not story/plot-wise.<BR>I am eager to read more of this author as her style &amp; talent is most captivating.	2004-05-04

First off, great book to read in the dead of winter.

The secrets they hold shed light on what it was like living during that era, especially as a woman. Yet, just the same, it reminded me of the common bonds that all women share. The emotions were shockingly real &amp; raw at times.<BR>And please, don't be fooled by that title. I was intrigued by it, but I think some might shy away from it because of the title.

But then again, this book made it difficult NOT to give it all the five it well deserves.<br />General category of this novel would have to be fiction, but yes, it transcends many: fiction, sci-fi, romance.<br />So touching &amp; poignant, I believe my favorite thing about this book is the variety of dialogue. I was immediately charmed by the amazing amount of wit within this little treasure.

You lose the intimacy between Henry &amp; Clare when all that's thrown in.<br />This is really such a sweet, unusual book.

This is a good book if you have insomnia; it will virtually disappear after a few pages. Shallow, shallow reading, no depth whatsoever, &amp; the writing, I must add, is horrible. She has no &quot;prose&quot; whatsoever, just plain sentences. It's like reading something from junior high, only with a few &quot;big&quot; words. <BR>I will try &amp; finish it though.

The more I read, the more I loved it. It has so many facets: I laughed, I was sad, I was angry at times, confused, and slightly surprised.<BR>Many people wonder as to why Oprah always picks these books where there's so much drama & turmoil w/in the story.  I'm finding that to read a story such as this where a character can go through such difficult, almost unbearable times, it's even more inspirational to me.<BR>I was so sad to see this book end.

Still can't get these wonderful people out of my head.<BR>Also, I must add I thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue between the sisters when they were little, specifically Frances, Mercedes, & Lily.

She flip-flops back &amp; forth from feeling resentment towards her family to appreciating the chaotic way in which they all operate in a much unappreciative way towards her.<BR>That's the main thing that got to me: She's a doormat to her family. Few consider her as a person. There are times where you're thinking, &quot;Surely she's gonna let them have it now!&quot;. That would also contribute to some of the plot, but sadly- nothing.<BR>So why two stars even? I loved poor Rebecca &amp; felt such pity for her. I guess I had to finish the book to root her on. I also thought the premise of the story (what she was going through) was very true for so many women &amp; found it comforting, even consoling.<br />So, yeah, I suppose I would say read it.
