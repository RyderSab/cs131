Max Lucado is well-known for his ability to write devotional material that is extremely powerful, yet is easy to read and simple to comprehend.  It's Not About Me is sure to be a Lucado classic and is a must read for every Christian who faces emotional wounds, frustration, discouragment, or even minor set backs.<br />The reader will move quickly through the chapters and can easily gain perspective on their relationship to God and the spiritual struggles taking place in the heavenlies.  This book will be useful for both experienced Christians and new Christians as it directs the reader toward Scripture and doesn't attempt to replace or redirect any emphasis on the Holy Bible.	2004-06-15

It is very difficult to present written works that provide detailed information, amazing clarity, inspiration, and an emphasis on Scripture.  Francis Frangipane has created just such a work in his presentation of the Three Battlegrounds.<br />Sections one and two reveal very practical information concerning the struggles Christians face in the battle over their minds and their churches.  The information revealed in these sections will help to integrate common sense, experience, and practical applications into your church and/or personal devotion.<br />Section three is so simple yet powerful it will blow you away.  Here we are taught about the battle involving the Heavenly realm or at the strategic level.  Frangipane does not present controversial techniques nor does he disguise his own personal agenda.  He simply presents clear information concerning the battles that rage.  Like many readers, I underline as I read.  Looking back over section three, I have noticed that a majority of the pages have underlining and some chapters are almost completely underlined.<br />Christians of all experience levels and backgrounds will benefit from reading this book.  The book reads quickly and easily because there is not any extra opinions or information.  The material is well developed but to the point.  This work does not present the &quot;shaky ground&quot; findings of some spiritual warfare advocates.  It does however present historical, Scriptural, and pracitical information so that prayers can address specific strongholds in all of our lives.	2004-06-15

(Spiritual Mapping)	Books	5	29	29	N	Y	Thorough Research and Explanation of a Complex Subject	I owe a huge debt to Dr. Otis for his research regarding this subject.  The author launched his research to determine why spiritual darkness exists where it does.  It is clear that territorial spirits are both real and Biblical.  But, as believers we need to go a step further and understand why are they there and how can we seek God's guidance in overcoming their harmful effects.<br />Twilight Labyrinth is not a quick read.  The early chapters provide an introduction and make the research relevant.  The next third of the chapters discuss historical concepts, spiritual beliefs and psychological realities, pointing toward their cause and effect relationships.  Finally, the book offers a summary of why darkness exists where it does based on Brother George's research. <br />This work requires effort and maturity on the part of the reader, however it offers a conclusion that should be understood by all church leaders.  If you are ready for an indepth study into spiritual warfare, This book is for you.	2004-03-04

He addresses the issues of defining spiritual warfare, can a Christian be demon-possessed, and should we engage in warfare with territorial spirits.  In this book, Dr. Arnold doesn't just explain his own personal opinion.  He develops the theology behind the practices of others, provides Scripture references, and then concludes with what his study suggests is the truth regarding this issue.<br />Dr. Arnold gives good presentation for the view points that are not in harmony with his own personal convictions and he presents the material so that the reader can independantly develop their own interpretation.  I appreciate his exhaustive study on these issues and this book explained so many things regarding spiritual warfare.<br />The information Arnold presents should be explained to and understood by every believer.  Understanding the material presented does not require a background in SW but will require that the reader have a hunger to learn about these issues.  That said, this book would be great reading for experienced Christians as well as new Christians.	2004-02-23

He applies the five church functions plus prayer, made popular by Rick Warren, to overcoming the bondage imposed by sin and the enemy of God.  The book stresses the need for discipleship and training or equipping in the area of the full armor of God as presented in Ephesians 6:10-20.<br />This book reads very smoothly and the material presented can be easily comprehended.  This book is a must read for church pastors.  Both the experienced pastor and new ministers will benefit from reading and applying these principles.<br />The most refreshing part of this work is that these are universal principles.  Many works that are written about spiritual warfare apply only historical accounts about experiences from someones past.  Those experiences are important but are not universal.  Dr. Lawless has used his expertise and God given talent to organize the material found in Discipled Warriors and I believe you, your family, your church, and your community will benefit greater from your ministry after you have read this book.	2004-01-31

I love to read a book that is motivating and keeps you reading while you are taught in-depth principles regarding a specific subject.  That is what Peter Wagner did in creating this book.  The book motivates you toward a deeper prayer life and it also equips you to put that new prayer life into practice.  <br />This book is an excellent read for an experienced spiritual warrior and for a new Christian as well.  The instruction regarding spiritual warfare keeps the focus on the one being prayed to rather than the one who is doing the praying.  That is an important aspect of Peter Wagner's books.<br />The book claims that this is the book the devil most wants you to avoid.  I think that might be true for many people because the principles are so simply stated that all who hunger for a greater prayer walk and are led to this book, will be a spiritual force in their church, family, and community.	2004-01-26

The truth is that anyone can take a complex issue and make it sound complex.  In The Dream Giver, the authors have taken a very complex, yet motivating aspect of life and they have made it very simple.  <br />The story of Ordinary leaving Familiar is very simple.  And it is true that you can see many of the illustrations before they are fully developed, but that is not a bad thing.  I have been going through the process of reevaluating my dreams, goals, etc. and I had begun to think that the emotions I was experiencing were unique to me.  However, this presentation reveals to me that the experience of spiritually chasing your dream is universal.<br />Specifically, I have been dealing with God's asking me to give Him my dreams and then receiving them back after He becomes more important to me than they are.  Having read Ordinary's tale, I now understand so much more about the process of developing a Big Dream, inspired by the Dream Giver.<br />I recommend this book for mature Christians, new Christians, and even the discouraged unchurched.  I think this book could be a great tool for evangelizing the unchurched because the descriptions of Ordinary's experiences will speak to them and confirm the reality of God's hand upon their lives.	2004-01-12

This book would be a great gift for someone considering the ministry.	2004-01-12

His writing and ideas are in harmony with Scripture and every principle found in this book, traces its origin back to the Bible.  In this presentation, the author has reduced the spiritual passion that all believers were created to enjoy into simple illustrations.

The first few chapters really hold your attention and give you many illustrations that aid in retention.  This is a good book for an advanced evangelist or a new Christian.  However, I don't like how the book is promoted.  I am not sure it is the training manual for end time believers and I don't like the connection the cover of the book makes with the Left Behind series.  Yet, this is a must read.	2003-12-19

Encouragement is in fact a two way street.  If you read a book about encouragement you are probably expecting to learn how to be more positive personally.  However, we also need to know about our responsibility to be more encouraging toward others.  This book will teach the reader that we are responsible for every word and every action toward others.  Our responses to other people can be encouraging or discouraging.  I don't think I had taken my actions toward others serious enough until I read this book.  This book should be read by all high school students because it really guides the reader into a better understanding of both self-image and social responsibility.  The book is a quick read and holds your attention very well.	2003-12-19

I have used Dr. McClains book many times when preparing messages and doing Bible studies on the book of Romans.  This written work reads very smoothly from chapter to chapter, however it could also be used as a Bible reference book.  The comments and doctrines presented are very accurate and in harmony with other Scripture passages, which is occassionally missing in this type of book.  This book could be valuable to the Bible Scholar as well as a new Christian who is interested in a deeper study on the book of Romans.	2003-12-19

This is perhaps the most beautiful book I own on the outside.  The cover is awesome!  But the written material inside leaves little to be desired.  There is some historical significance in the sermons presented, and Smith Wigglesworth's focus was on God.  However, reading these sermons leaves the reader questioning how he can perform the miracles rather than how great God is for being able to bless His people.  There are many other Christian books which will enhance your spiritual life and lead you to a closer relationship with Jesus Christ.  This book will only lead you to confusion and questions about how Christians are to live.  Only the most disciplined and most studied of Christian should read this book.  This book would be harmful in the hands of a new Christian.	2003-12-19

One of the first things presented in this book is that the principles that work at the Saddleback Church, may not work everywhere.  The name Rick Warren gets tossed around by those who praise him and by those who blame him.  But he declares right away that these are not universal principles.  <br />That said, this is a well written book that reads smoothly and provides a fresh approach to evangelism.  This is a book for church leaders.  My fear is that church members will decide their pastor is not doing his job because he doesn't practice the Purpose Driven Church principles.  <br />If a person wants their pastor to consider the things presented in this book, buy the book for him, but don't read the book yourself and then try to implement the practices described inside.<br />Church's that begin as Purpose Driven Churches will be much more effective in applying these principles than a church that is already established.<br />Read this book with caution and don't change churches because you think this sounds exciting.	2003-12-19

I bought this book after hearing Robert Rohm speak at a conference and at the time I was not Southern Baptist nor did I know who Dr. Criswell was.  The testimony about Dr. Criswell's life and ministry really spoke to me and stirred up a desire in my heart to find out more about the man and how God blessed his faithfulness.  This book is very well written and is very interesting.  Most important to me is that I do not remember a line in the book that takes the emphasis off of God and places focus on Brother Criswell.  Instead we are reminded of God's supremacy and the pastor's relationship with God.  Every reader will not agree with Dr. C's doctrine, however the book doesn't make an issue out of that and every reader will benefit from the testimony as it is presented.	2003-12-19

However, the amazing thing is that so many points are discussed that I had never considered and now wonder how I lived so long without knowing.

Most sermon books cannot be read smoothly from one chapter to the next.  In these messages, the reader can smoothly transition from chapter to chapter.  Because this is a sermon book, some points are repeated because there are different messages covering the same Scriptures.  However, in true Criswell style you will not grow weary reading two messages about the same exact Scriptures.  This is a great book for the reader who wants to read it straight through and it is also a great book for the person who wants to study it as a resource book.	2003-12-18
