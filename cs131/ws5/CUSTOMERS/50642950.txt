Laurie McBain always writes well, but the characters and plot just didn't grab me. The main character, Mara, was mainly tangled up with her unreliable brother, her dependent nephew, or their money problems while being harassed by the hero for a previous wrong she had done to his (the hero's) nephew. Anyway, suffice to say I actually read this about a month before writing this and had to review it quite a bit to be able to write this.	2005-09-24

All he cared about was appearances --- a character flaw that was sometimes amusing and often irritating. His obsession with convention was worse than any sour spinster and rendered him just as manly. Doesn't everyone want a hero who says to hell with the rules? He may have been a dangerous man in the wild west, but he was a milksop in elegant England. Moreland's eventual fall from grace I found more puzzling than romantic and too little too late.<br /><br />Mercy's character started out well but after being presented as brave and honorable, she soon deteriorated into a blackmailing whiner. She was annoyingly obtuse about following instructions when tagging along on the search for her brother and just annoyingly obtuse about said brother altogether. After calculating, scheming, obsessing, and blackmailing her way through England I wasn't really endeared to any of her causes, period.	2005-09-24

No insult intended. There are many of them (one for each state) in this series of somewhat short novels which reflect the good old non pc days --- interesting for a change, sometimes.<br /><br />Jessica Thorne, waiting for the traffic lights to change and cross the street, finds herself standing next to Brodie Hayes. Once the town bad-boy and an ardent admirer of her older sister, Jordanna, Brodie has now become a successful and wealthy businessman.<br /><br />At first, Brodie mistakes Jessica for Jordanna. Jessica barely recalls Brodie since she was a young girl at the time, however, she does remember that Brodie was very aggressive and, at times, threatening in his pursuit of her sister. Brodie had also been angry when Jordanna rejected him and was rather convinced that the reason was that the well-to-do Thornes looked down on him for being poor.<br /><br />Thus, when Brodie invites Jessica for lunch, she is determined to cleverly maneuver her way out of it but she soon finds she is no match for a determined Brodie Hayes. A romance blossoms although Jessica is tortured by the thought that he is trying to live out his fantasy --- or get revenge ---- for Jordanna. Also disturbing is his habit of buying her expensive gifts as if he is trying to buy her affections. Later, we find that Brodie wants a more permanent relationship with Jessica, but not marriage, and Jessica wants a ring. They break up and it seems like there's no hope, but after Jessica loses her temper and makes a scene in a restaurant, it breaks the ice for some true confessions.<br /><br />Not great, but an interesting glimpse at past ideas of what a \\"modern\\" woman was!	2005-09-24

Rosalind and Kinau nurse Peter back to health and care for the baby, Victor Darien. Once back on his feet, Peter quickly decides to marry Rosalind and takes her to his home on Darien island.<br /><br />There, Rosalind must contend with Peter's greedy and lazy cousins, Eileen and Terry. Eileen amuses herself by day, lounging and complaining, and by night, sleeping with various ranch hands. Terry, attempts to avoid as much work as he can while sleeping around as much as he can.<br /><br />In fact, it is Terry who originally caused all the trouble by having an affair with a powerful native chief's daughter. This woman bore Victor as an outcast from her family and gave the child to Peter for safety as she died. Now the chief wants his grandchild and revenge. The discovery of black pearls on Darien island stirs up more greed and danger, further straining Peter and Rosalind's blossoming relationship.<br /><br />This book moved quickly with lots of action and kept my interest. Peter and Rosalind's romance, however, was a little spare --- Peter just sort of decided to get married and Rosland just sort of decided to go along with it. Rosalind tended to be overpowered by Peter at times but the support of the faithful Kinau prevented her from being entirely friendless and overwhelmed as sometimes happened in other Robert books.	2005-09-24

The hero, Julian, is portrayed as an oblivious, ineffective, idiot. He knows how to grow grapes and make wine but anything beyond that seems to be a big blank.<br /><br />Julian takes Regina from New York to his home in France and, apparently, Julian is surrounded by problems.<br /><br />There are legitimate money problems due to bad years at the vineyard and price gouging by the French wine and banking industries. These are problems Julian is aware of that Regina and her family solves for him.<br /><br />Then, there are the more damaging problems that Julian is completely unaware of stemming from his blind trust in his cousin, Claude (that everyone and the whole village hates.) However, Regina (who barely gets by in French) comprehends immediately that Claude is a crook, the villagers are needy, her invalid brother-in-law, Eric, craves more mental challenges, and her idiot brother-in-law, Marcus, is not an idiot. Lastly, Julian doesn't know that everyone knows about his mistress and son.<br /><br />It was frustrating to read about such an amazingly competent heroine paired with an amazingly incompetent hero.	2005-09-24

The story starts with her feebly disguised as a boy, working at the gin swilling pub owned by a family friend. Specifically, her father's old mistress' son, Zack, who she grew up with when they were all living together as one happy family for a few of her young years. Zack's smarmy pub is, naturally, in the smarmiest part of London. The Bad Baron has disappeared and Katie is pennliess and homeless and Zack is the only person she has left to ask for help. What Katie doesn't know is that the Baron had told Zack a few years before that the only future open to Katie as the Bad Baron's daughter was to become someone's mistress. So, Zack sets out to carry out the Baron's wishes altho Katie is adamantly against it.<br /><br />When Lord Linden saves Katieboy from a run-in with an ugly customer (not just skin deep), Zack takes this opportunity to drug and deliver Katie for her new job as Linden's new plaything. Linden turns out to be drunk as, well, as a lord and almost forces Katie into sleeping with him (yay for euphamisms) but then he is smote by his conscience and doesn't. From then on, Linden receives regular beatings from his conscience, it seems. Sadly out of character, if I may say so, and for so unworthy a cause. Anyway, when he finds out who Katie really is, he tries to track down her father who remains persistenly missing.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back at the swank Linden London bachelor pad, someone has been trying to kill Katie which results in an embarrassing social blunder. Classic Katie moment. Thanks to the social blunder, however, we meet Linden's younger brother, Andrew, who is perfect for the Cat Role (think Windflower) in our story. The murder attempt prompts Linden to make his real sometime mistress take Katie in temporarily for safekeeping. The rest of the story involves keeping the idiotic Katie alive and finding the equally iditioc Bad Baron.<br /><br />As you may already have guessed by the winding down tone of my summary, of all the things I despise most in a story it's a spineless, jellyfish of a heroine. Invertebrates such as this are to be despised. The only reason this got two stars is that the Curtises writing is always, at least, readable, and Linden has some humorous dialogue. However, most times I found myself longing to fling this book across the room because I was denied the satisfaction of doing Katie some serious bodily harm myself.<br /><br />Note that I wasn't so mad at Zack (since he was just being realistic and, really, confronted with someone as brainless as Katie what dastardly deeds would I be driven to?) as much as I was mad at Katie for living in a fool's paradise and relying on her father. Hasn't she learned anything over the years? Geez! I mean, if you don't want to become a mistress, fine, then go find a maid job or find some farmer to marry in the country or WHATEVER. Don't just rely on a patently unreliable father to show up and work in a sinkhole bar in the meantime expecting not to get caught and pressed into active duty as something besides a waiter.<br /><br />We can't always have an assertive, independent, 21st century thinker stuck in a period costume. Katie's character is innocent, honest, good, and trusting. She had a bad childhood (continuing to adulthood) being poor, neglected, and spurned by all because of her father's reputation which probably wasn't a confidence builder. She just goes along with whatever comes, passively accepting bad things. I understand this is her character. I understand this is a realistic character. What I don't want to do is read about this character. I mean and at least if she changed to become a little more street smart or assertive after all these horrid things keep happening but nooo . . . yi, I'm ranting here.<br /><br />Suffice to say, I was reading thru a red mist most of the time but, as always, you should form your own opinion. If Katie's your kindof girl, this story is for you.Katie's your kind of girl, this story is for you. <br />	2005-09-24

She has sworn off men after seeing her mother die in misery and loneliness, still calling for Mara's father who had long abandoned them to pursue his carefree life of wine and women.<br /><br />Determinedly disguising herself to look horribly unattractive, Mara is frustrated in her attempts at single freedom by her new guardian, Sir Gaylord Humphrey. He is determined to marry her off as quickly as possible and forcibly moves her in with his family and pretties her up with no expenses spared.<br /><br />Mara soon runs into an old enemy from her days as a freedom fighter with her Spanish tutor. While trying to deal with that and Sir Humphrey's sister's affair with a young Spanish soldier, she is compromised into marrying Sir Humphrey to avoid scandal.<br /><br />For someone supposedly brave enough to fight as a freedom fighter, Mara becomes sadly spiritless when it comes to organizing her own life. Whenever Mara and Sir Humphrey clash, she just collapses like a souffle and wonders how she ended up living at Sir Humphrey's house . . . or wearing pretty new clothing . . . or marrying Sir Humphrey.	2005-09-24

The characters were well-drawn and covered the problems inherent with a virtual nobody having a romance with a super-mega star.<br /><br />We'll suspend disbelief that somebody as seemingly perfect and probably jaded as the hunky Neil Stratton could fall in forever-kind-of-love with an unsophisticated, emotional baggage carrying, rather stick-in-the-mud minister's daughter, Kathy Carter.<br /><br />Okay, Kathy wasn't all that bad. She sounds real nice, actually, and she was gorgeous, to boot. Her near obsession with her deceased husband was believable. Her insecurities and feelings of inadequacy when faced with the full impact of Neil's background, sophistication, talent, and fortune would be natural, I should think, so no complaints from me there.<br /><br />However, (you knew there was a however coming) as understanding as I am of her mixed feelings, her wishywashyness was a bit wearing. Everytime she did the \\"theresnowayimgoingwithyou!\\" song and dance or the old \\"AndIneverwanttoseeyouagian!\\" , he'd just call or send flowers or whatever and she'd just turn into a little puddle at his feet, melted by the rays of his starpower, no doubt.<br /><br />Okay, that was way harsh but the bit at the end where she rushes to his concert! I groaned and wondered aloud to myself \\"why the heck doesn't she just wait and call him after the concert?\\" (only I used much stronger language, of course.) I guess it was better to end the book with a grand romantic gesture than a fizzle but in this case I would have preferred the fizz.	2005-09-24

Wish I could give 0 stars instead of 1 for this one.<br /><br />Lady Barbara Grandison is sailing from England to Lisbon to meet her horrible fiance, Colonel Aubrey Fortney --- arranged by her horrible father --- when she is taken prisoner by an American ship. In time, Captain Jasper Trent (hero #1) attacks her (I'm being euphamistic here) and she ends up liking him somewhat somehow.<br /><br />Hard upon the heels of all that, the ship is captured by pirates and soon Barbara is attacked by Captain Nicholas Devon (hero #2) and over time she ends up liking him somewhat somehow. At this point, I'm wondering why I ever started reading this book (oh yeah, I blindly ordered it over the internet with no idea of the plot.) But I digress.<br /><br />To continue: After some time passes during which Barbara is sufficiently abused by Nick, Trent escapes and takes Barbara with him and they escape to New Orleans. There follows a lot of historical plotting and so forth with the fate of the city and Lafitte or something but I wasn't really paying attention because I was so annoyed already.<br /><br />Then Barbara finds she is pregnant with Nick's baby and Trent promptly marries her. Then Aubrey appears. Then Nick appears. Then Barbara and Trent discover they love each other and live happily ever after.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say that this story has less to do with romance than, say, acceptance in the face of terrible misfortune but that's just me.	2005-09-24

When she overhears a friend, Oliver Seymour, calling her plain and dowdy she is so enraged she decides to masqerade as Gabrielle and make him fall in love with her.<br /><br />I can suspend disbelief on the silly plot as long as the story is entertaining, but the whole story is weighted down by interfering relatives and the heroine's own feelings of inferiority. When the real Gabrielle --- could you doubt she would? --- shows up, although the author tries to show that Minna is slowly finding herself and standing up for herself, it all just seemed awkward and embarrassing and no fun.	2005-09-24

He is psychologically, if not physically, damaged from the experience and although Christine tries to be understanding, their marriage suffers. Jesse has an alarmingly large and loving Hungarian family and it is from his parents --- that fought in their own revolution and escaped for their own ideals --- that he is has learned the value of freedom and to stand by his beliefs. With the help of his family and Christine's love, he is eventually able to move on with his life.<br /><br />While this book still has the quirky humor usually found in the Curtises' books, it lacked the strong characters and storyline. Also, it seemed to me that the silly humor sat rather oddly with the extremely serious storyline --- a couple trying to overcome psychological and marital problems --- and just didn't blend well. I was especially dissatisfied with the resolution in the end. It was anti-climactic, to say the least, and I wondered if I had missed something because I didn't know how it had all suddenly worked out over something so simple. Granted, this end may be more realistic than a more dramatic ending, but it seemed like the story was building up to something more significant and then --- blah. Well, it IS a very short book, after all.<br /><br />Die hard fans will probably want to read this but, otherwise, give it a miss.	2005-09-24

Diane Trask, eighteen years old, is left alone in the world upon the death of her stepfather.  She also is left an heiress.  Her stepfather's brother and wife appear to help her take care of business matters and encourage her to take a Mediterranean cruise with them to help get over her grief.<br /><br />Not long after the cruise starts, she witnesses a murder through a porthole.  In shock, she stumbles down the stairs into the arms of professional gem hunter, Eric Van Kirk.  While blood and other evidence is found, there is no body although it has possibly been tossed overboard.  Eric looks out for Diane and introduces her to his shipboard acquaintances.  Wealthy, sophisticated people with stories of their own.<br /><br />A luxury ocean liner cruise circa 1950 means roaming a limited area, with limited things to do, with a limited acquaintance.  The mystery murder plays out a bit long over the length of a short book, as does the romance between Diane and Eric.	2004-11-05

She has one year to fulfill this dream before her father calls her back to England and an arranged marriage.<br /><br />Desperately, she tries to find any serious teacher willing to teach a woman but her attempts meet only contempt and ridicule.  Finally, fate hands her a chance when she accompanies a friend to play for her singing audition and is taken as a student by Baron Lukas von Korda.  Once a brilliant concert pianist himself, he must now turn to composing due to a duelling wound that has rendered his arm useless for playing.<br /><br />Diana spends a frustratingly long book learning about music, nurturing a tentative romance with the Baron, and trying to convince her father that she wants a serious career in music rather than an arranged marriage to a despised fiance.  This one just didn't catch my attention and I just hurried through it to get to the end.	2004-11-05

Silva is so detached from the rest of the world, she doesn't know what a \\"present\\" or \\"honeymoon\\" is.  Brian spends most of the book trying to help her get around in civilization since Silva is hopelessly clueless when they visit modern Miami.<br /><br />Basically, this story just didn't grab me.  The posturing and squabbling of the islanders bored me, the heroine was a naive idiot, and the hero was overbearing and self-serving.	2004-10-24

While the entire family's prospects rise and Jared himself rises to be a millionaire, this lovely family picture is marred by the fact that Jared has met a beautiful woman named Vashti.  Jared and Vashti begin a lifelong love affair and --- between the 6 kids he has with Miriam --- even have a daughter together.<br /><br />Miriam knows about her husband's affair and is jealous but accepting.  Jared congratulates himself on being successful and just like the famous men in the Old Testament with multiple wives.  The story continues with the fortunes of the rest of the family but by that time I had lost interest and skimmed it.<br /><br />This was a frustrating read for me.  I pretty much consistently dislike long-term triangle stories and this was no exception.	2004-10-24

They meet with Rudolf von Dornstein, who invites them to the family castle so that his mother and some art expert friends can look over the possible recovered items, including the treasured Dornstein icon.<br /><br />Once there, Rudolf's mother claims that the items are not real, but her behavior belies her words.  Rudolf then refuses to let them leave the remote castle --- confiscating their car under the pretense of having it repaired --- and begins to question Caroline about how much she knows about Greg.  At one point, a madman --- one of the Dornstein relatives --- tries to strangle Caroline in her room.<br /><br />With all of this suspicious behavior from everyone, Caroline eventually tries to run away on foot from the castle and is caught.  Rudolf then starts drugging her, marries her, and continues his drugging and questioning about Greg until the truth is finally revealed.<br /><br />Frankly, if this book hadn't been so short I would not even have finished it.  Caroline was pathetic, not even making a decent attempt to refuse the drugs and Rudolf was just as pathetic for using them.	2004-10-24

He opposed the marriage and threatened to have it annulled.<br /><br />Deborah did not want Alice raised by a housekeeper and with all the opposition, she told Morgan they would have to wait, at least until Alice became an adult.  Morgan was enraged and left to return to his regiment.<br /><br />Seven years later, Morgan returns.  Having inherited a title, he is now rich Lord Treverly.  Deborah has become a tired, unpaid nursemaid for Gertrude's children while the beautiful Alice is being groomed for a spectacular marriage.<br /><br />Morgan barely recognizes Deborah.  Gertrude encourages a match between Morgan and Alice while Deborah fades into the background.  Deborah's new friend Lady Horatia Torrington almost succeeds in bringing out some assertiveness in Deborah but, no, she remains full of self doubt and hopeless love for Morgan.<br /><br />A long book made interminably longer by the pathetic heroine's hopeless longing for the uncaring hero.	2004-10-24

The copy I read was written under the pen name \\"Louisa Bronte.\\"  For any reader disturbed by references to sorcery/demons or dated gothic/nonpc stories, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />It is the late 19th century.  Sophia had been orphaned at an early age and adopted by a rich woman who made her the heir to her cosmetic empire.  Sophia has just married and she and her husband, Greg, are on their honeymoon traveling to her parents' old homeland somewhere in the Balkans.  Greg had wanted to travel elsewhere but Sophia insisted since something has been drawing her there, perhaps related to the strange powers she has and tries to hide.<br /><br />By chance, they meet Count Vlhos, who is a distant relative of Sophia's.  He invites Sophia, Greg, and a party of friends to his remote castle for a visit.  Vlhos soon reveals that his real aim is Sophia.  To her he reveals all of his supernatural powers and tries very hard to seduce her away from Greg.  With her, he can increase his powers and have the world at his feet.<br /><br />Sophia soon gives in to the Count's persuasion.  With him, she has found a kindred spirit and one with whom she can be herself.  However, she will not agree to leave her husband and strange, near-fatal accidents begin to happen to Greg.  At war with herself, Sophia finally decides that she cannot desert Greg and tries to escape from the castle with him.<br /><br />I'll leave it for the reader to find out for themselves the surprise end.  I enjoyed reading this book very much.  It was a short novel, fast-paced, with an unconventional plot and an unexpected twist.  However, as a romance, I felt it was not a very good one. The characters were prey to their own human flaws and seemed to feed each others' worst side.  That and the fact that the heroine was constantly ridden by guilt about the husband that loved her but could never truly understand her.<br /><br />For being involving and unforgettable, I rated this very highly.nvolving and unforgettable, I rated this very highly.	2004-10-17

Now, Christine, having finally come of age, strikes out to track down Oliver, both to ensure her safety from Hugo and to keep Oliver from being arrested.<br /><br />She hires Jonathan Brandewine as her guide to take her to a certain inn in the wilderness, the last place her brother had written to her from.  They are accompanied by Jonathan's Wyandot Indian friend, Gray Wolf, and Bill Sheridan, a traveler who claimed he was heading their way and admired Christine very much.<br /><br />Once at the inn, Christine finds odd clues that her brother had stayed at the inn and fears the worst.  No one has seen Oliver or the Wyandot Indian friends he was traveling with for some time.  The innkeeper and his wife, the Grubers, are a strange couple with a mad son.  Jonathan tells Christine that it is best if they pretend to be married while they remain at the inn.<br /><br />Hugo Turley then turns up at the inn to stir up trouble.  Then just as soon turns up murdered.  With everyone snowed in, the atmosphere is tense and Christine even begins to suspect Jonathan.<br /><br />This was quite a short novel but it packed quite a decent mystery story full of suspense.  The romance is rather dated with our forceful hero running roughshod over our heroine's protests but, in a way, I often think it is probably a better reflection of the time period than having our modern ideas being played out on the prairie.  Overall, I liked this book very much.	2004-10-17

The romance was rather dated and the greek gods involvement was so bizarre that I just had ??? in my head after I finished this book.<br /><br />Daphne Cora and her younger sister, Ariadne, come to Greece so that Daphne can accept one of two job offers:  either at a museum or at an archeological dig for Sebastian Palaeopolis, a wealthy tycoon.  Sebastian reaches Daphne first and arranges for her to work for him despite her anger at his arrogance.<br /><br />Once on the remote island home of Sebastian, things get supernatural.  Daphne has always had visions of the future, something she has hidden from others.  Now, however, Sebastian encourages her to use her skills.  In fact, he has always known about her abilities and plans to use them to further his business ambitions.<br /><br />Eventually, he reveals his plans to all when he calls on his god/ancestor . . . Apollo!  Yes, Apollo then proceeds to help him force Daphne into marriage and to fall in with Sebastian's plans for power.  At one point, Daphne even calls on Diana to defend her from Apollo and Sebastian's machinations, but in the end, she gives in to love and destiny.<br /><br />In all, while I didn't think this short novel was very good and sometimes had to roll my eyes at something particularly outrageous, I actually was quite entertained reading it and will certainly remember it.  However, I will say that if the non-politically correct and dramatic 70's bothers you, skip this one for a more modern and conventional romance.	2004-10-17

If you're at all bothered by mention of witchcraft, demons, or non-politically correct happenings, skip this book.<br /><br />On the other hand, it was quite an interesting, creepy read, trying to figure out who was really who and doing what --- somewhat reminiscent of \\"Rosemary's Baby.\\"<br /><br />Isabel Hardin has lived quietly with her adoptive parents in the country.  Now, she will go to college and live with the family friend, Aunt Camilla, who is a professor of chemistry at the college.  Once there, she meets Matthew Freeman, a handsome senior chemistry student.  Isabel and Matthew find they like each other and begin dating.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Aunt Camilla introduces Isabel to her friends who like to \\"play at witchcraft.\\"  It is soon discovered that Isabel actually has an enormous talent but she is very uncomfortable with the supernatural.  Although Isabel dislikes the parties and Aunt Camilla's friends, her Aunt insists that she continue to attend.<br /><br />Worse is to come.  Aunt Camilla takes her on a picnic with her friends at which Isabel is drugged and attacked by a demon of some kind while strange animals dance around.  Terrified, she turns to Matthew who assures her he would like to marry her, however, this is not what Isabel wants, either.  In time, they quarrel, and Isabel begins to see that Matthew may not truly be the kind man that she thought he was.<br /><br />There are many twists in the plot which leave you wondering who is \\"bad\\" and who is \\"good\\" and the ending will surprise and, perhaps, upset you.  While it is a romance of a sort between Isabel and Matthew, I don't think conventional romance readers would appreciate this gothic, terror-filled novel. For being involving and unforgettable, I rated this very highly.	2004-10-17

There is also Brad's Japanese secretary, Pearl, who everyone knows is also Brad's mistress.  There are constant threats to Brad's business --- and to Brad and Charita --- by others who want to steal his jewelry-making techniques.<br /><br />Actually, I found this story very interesting with all the dysfunctional family problems and corporate espionage.  However I didn't give it a very good rating because the romance between Brad and Charita was very dated and disappointing.  Charita was just so pathetic and easily overpowered by the domineering Brad.  There's something to an assertive hero, but this went beyond that to the point of annoying.  I often found myself wanting to shake Charita and give Brad a swift kick.	2004-10-17

Her cruel stepfather, Hector Ryder, works them like slaves and is planning to turn her over to his gambling partner, the Marquess of Tweed.  Into this scene comes the red-headed ex-sailor, Morgan Hamilton.  He is about to take one last voyage to claim his inheritance --- a sugar plantation on a remote island in the Caribbees.  Ideally, it would be best to take a wife with him and he manages to outsmart Hector and the Marquess and win Tess at cards.  Morgan and Tess marry and set off on their journey.  Vincent secretly accompanies them and although Morgan is at first angry, he later becomes reconciled since he needs all the help he can get at the plantation.<br /><br />Threatening neighbors, slave uprisings, and the trials of plantation life ensue but none of it could keep my interest.  I particularly became a bit glassy-eyed whenever rum-making was being discussed.  Which was frequently.  Also, all the realities of slave life here were particularly depressing despite the upbeat ending.	2004-10-16

However, due to the political intrigues of the day, her father was murdered while Lily, her spanish mother Magdalena, and the family friend, Sir Basil, were left stranded upon a desert isle.<br /><br />There, Magdalena gave birth to Lily's brother, Tristram.  In time, as no rescue appeared, Magdalena and Basil grew to love each other and had a girl child, Dulcie.  Magdalena and Basil contracted fevers from some shipwrecked sailors and died.  The three children continued to live alone on the island until the appearance of Basil's brother, Captain Valentine Whitelaw, who had come to rescue them.<br /><br />In England, the children adjusted to civilized life with much difficulty.  Basil's wife, sister, and son, Simon, welcomed them but legally, Lily and Tristram were under the guardianship of Lily's relative, Hartwell Barclay.  The children did not want to be separated and Dulcie also went with them to Hartwell.  Lily grew into a beautiful woman and, soon, Simon fell in love with her.  Hartwell also began to desire her and, after a botched attack on Lily that seemed to end in Hartwell's accidental death, she and her siblings fled to the gypsies for fear of their lives.<br /><br />The gypsy, Romney Lee, loved Lily also and allowed them to travel with his group of entertainers.  Lily and the children created a puppet show to earn a living, telling an old fantasy story Basil had always told them on the island.  However, when old enemies saw the puppet show and realized it's true meaning, Lily and her family were in danger once more.<br /><br />Once again, Valentine appeared, back from trips at sea.  He did not recognize the grown up Lily and he, too, desired her.  Amid some misunderstandings and anger, it was determined that they must return to the island to pick up Basil's journal with all the proof they needed to solve multiple problems facing them.  On the island, Lily and Valentine finally became lovers and managed to gather the journal and hidden treasure.  All of which contributed to a happy ending, at last.<br /><br />The good point about this story is that I actually read this book ages ago and never forgot about the couple being stranded on a desert island who grew to love each other.

However, it is Oliver's cousin, Lorenz, who is immediately attracted to Jacinth the moment they meet.  Presently, Harold leaves to attend to business at home and Delia remains to chaperone Jacinth.<br /><br />While Jacinth and Lorenz become close and are involved with trying to create new perfumes --- a difficult and rare accomplishment involving much skill --- Delia creates scandals with Oliver and one of the field hands.  The potential scandal may be enough to force the Essex women to leave and Lorenz decides that he loves Jacinth too much to let her leave and tricks her into spending the night with him.<br /><br />The ensuing scandal forces them into marriage, just as Lorenz had planned.  While Jacinth is initially angry, she eventually realizes that she, too, loves Lorenz and much prefers him to any of the elderly suitors her father had planned to marry her off to.<br /><br />The story continues with Jacinth's attempts to create a new perfume for her new friend, a Russian princess.  Delia continues with her indiscretions and everyone awaits Harold's arrival to see what he will do about his wife's notorious conduct and his daughter's scandalous marriage.<br /><br />While the plot centers a lot around the perfume making business, it remained interesting enough that the pace did not suffer.  Delia's amorous antics are in direct contrast to Jacinth's romance with Lorenz and kept the story from being potentially too saccharine.  By today's standards, very politically incorrect behaviors (both by perpetrators and victims) which I strangely find acceptable in a historical romance that I would not in a modern romance (let alone real life.)	2004-10-16

Their plane crashes onto a remote island before they reach their destination and they are held prisoner in a cabin together for an interminable time (for me, not them.)  Finally, they win their freedom and with all the media hype on the Greek hotel tycoon and a hotel tycoon's daughter, Gregorios announces that they are getting married.<br /><br />Finally Gregorios and Iris get to the island and his relatives and hers get there as well for an interminable visit (for me, not them.)  The marriage goes through and a vendetta something with designer ambitions.  Oops, I'm jumbling things together.<br /><br />Well, my recollections aren't too clear from here and I don't feel inspired to re-read this so you'll have to read the book yourself to discover how it all ends.	2004-10-16

I read this book on the train and by page 150 it seemed to have dragged out twice as long as the interminable train ride I was taking.<br /><br />Rather than being exciting, the haphazard way it started made me feel that the characters were emotionless and unrealistic --- as characters in old fashioned fairy tales often seem.  From there, the story just seemed to drag and drag without anything of real importance or interest happening.<br /><br />Alissa and Strell, the two main characters, meet up and end up traveling together.  In this way we explore more about the enmity of Plainsmen and Foothills people --- Strell being a Plainsman and Alissa being a hated half breed of the two.  This could have been a chance to explore a budding romance but it seemed more like a straight sociology lesson.<br /><br />Being a latent Keeper (or magic wielder), there is an opportunity for some magical pyrotechnics, but again, this opportunity is squandered.  Neither Strell nor Alissa believe in magic and spend all their time shunning its possiblity and when Alissa does start stumbling over her magical abilities, she uses them for exciting things like having visions.  Good for the plot, bad for the excitement factor.  Here Alissa also meets the mysterious being named Useless who realistically but boringly does his best to warn her away from the Keep.<br /><br />When Alissa and Strell (finally - whew) reach the Hold, they try to masquerade as brother and sister.  The villain, Bailic, sees through their lie because he thinks Strell acts like he is courting Alissa.  What?  This guy should be a super matchmaker instead of a super villain if he can see chemistry in this relationship.<br /><br />I skimmed and skipped my way through to the end and was not terribly excited when many of the mysteries were revealed in better detail.  For magic, dragons, and reluctant hero types, I'd recommend Tamora Pierce or Patricia Briggs instead.icia Briggs instead.	2003-01-03

Learning that Phillip's father had told her a lie and prevented them from speaking was weak and amounted to what I would consider a gaping plot hole.	2002-12-22

Claudia's not really immune to him either but they've hidden the attraction behind constant bickering until they day they get rip roaring drunk and end up married in Vegas.<br />Both of them had the time of their lives on their wedding night although neither really remembers the details.  Zach isn't all that unhappy with their marriage but Claudia is still in bickering mode and wants a divorce asap, so Zach goes along with it.<br />Zach is a lawyer with the US Marines and Claudia is an undercover reporter.  Claudia stumbles on a body while jogging which happens to be that of a marine.  Guess which lawyer is assigned the case?  Give this reader a cigar!  For one reason or other, both of them want in on this mystery and they end up using their marriage as a cover for some investigation, moving in across the street from the murder suspect --- the wife of a high ranking officer.<br />While well-written overall, the love story gets rather overpowered by the battered wife issue that is being explored here.  Romance also takes a back seat to solving the mystery, it seemed, because I remember more details about the clues they researched than anything about the hero and heroine's relationship.<br />As readers of \\"Always Faithful\\" may remember, Claudia has a self-centered, Machiavellian father.  Due to his interference with Claudia's early love life, she has been emotionally scarred, which explains why she is wary of relationships.  Still, it felt like Claudia and Zach's resistance to their attraction to each other was dragged out a bit too much and for no solid reason.<br />Lastly, the constant, well-meant meddling by Claudia's brother and sister-in-law just annoyed me rather than warmed my heart at their concern.<br />It kept my attention but at the end I was left feeling rather flat --- a promising story that didn't quite follow through.her flat --- a promising story that didn't quite follow through.	2002-12-22

She decides to escape and runs into a cab and meets Captain Jonathan Dillon.  Jonathan convinces Rebecca to go along with the trip to China --- all the better to escape in a foreign country, my dear --- and while they are attracted to each other, they decide to forget all about their meeting since they have other priorities.<br />Jonathan is trying to track down his missing sister.  He's afraid she's been sold into slavery in China, so that's where his ship is headed.  Guess who is travelling on board his ship?  Yup, the girl he couldn't forget is now in close proximity for an extended length of time.  Better yet, he discovers that her uncle is the man who has tricked his sister and has sold her into slavery.  This is the excuse he needs to forget his conscience and get what he wants from Rebecca.  He needn't work too hard, though, Rebecca has decided to forget her old way of life and seize the day --- and a lover --- before going on to a life of work and independence.<br />Despite a lot of twists and turns in the plot --- interference/ trouble from her family and his friends and family --- I'm sorry to say it just didn't capture my attention.  While it should have been exciting, all the extraneous characters and plotlines just seemed to distract from the romance and the development of their relationship.  Speaking of their relationship, things with Jonathan and Rebecca were going so fast, they didn't really seem to need a relationship or romance.<br />Finally, around 2/3 of the way into the book, I just couldn't get through to finish it so, in all honesty, perhaps it gets better at the end but I just never got there.	2002-12-22

Trevallyan is also in constant battle with his hangup about their age difference (rightfully so) which just made him seem insecure.  In turn, Ravenna hates Trevallyan for sending her off to an English school where she was shunned and ridiculed.  Again, plausible, but boring.  Ravenna's story within the story I simply found distracting from the real story and not particularly interesting.<br />Having no great obstacle but stubbornness and resentment, the story just dragged on and on.  Still, no matter how thin the plot, if told well, any story can be great.  Unfortunately, this story just did not catch my imagination.<br />And last but not least --- I know it's essential to the plot, but if I had to read the word &quot;geis&quot; one more time . . .	2002-12-21

We discover that these two have been together over the centuries again and again, playing out a doomed romance where the scenario is always similar and where the end is always the same --- death.<br />The romance between Alec and Dani was red hot and, at the same, tugged at your heartstrings.  They tried to so hard to be happy together every time but fate always conspired against them.  Also, the author does an excellent job of drawing parallels between social behaviors throughout history.  For example, over the ages, people reviled different things like children born out of wedlock or witchcraft.  Today, those are not a concern, but we still have other problems which make people want to form rabid lynch mobs and act pretty much the same.<br />I always enjoy these types of reincarnation stories and I try not to be too analytical but, being me, I can't help but ask questions.  My questions are always rather the same:  Why is it they only remember their past relationships in this lifetime?  Why couldn't they ever succeed in changing their fate before and this time they can? (you knew they would or this would be a tragedy, not a romance).  While the resolution in this story is very reasonable, it still does not quite answer these recurring questions solidly.  It's always a case of luck --- like \\"third time's a charm\\" or something, which isn't a bad thing but I'm always looking for something more concrete, I guess.<br />Still, that in no way dimished my enjoyment of a very fine tale.  Enjoy.	2002-12-16

David helps Frances find her great Aunt Sophia, who, coincidently enough, lives above David's young cousin, Richard Rivington.  Rivington, naturally, fills the Cat Role (we're talking Windflower, and no complaints from me there) and aids and abets Frances' hairbrained Sherlockian schemes.<br /><br />We have a positive ID of the suspect from the start:  Edward Kennan.  Actor supreme, sometime thief, smuggler, and framer of country parsons.  Thus, Frances decides to become an actress herself the better to spy, my dear.  Sadly, Frances can't act her way out of a paper bag and it is only thru the ulterior motived intervention (did that come out right?) of David that Frances gets a bit role in the play.  I'm not sure if this bad actress bit was supposed to be humorous but I just found it excruciatingly squirmacious.  In any case, Frances' work at the theatre promotes her sleuthing and her relationship with David to the conclusion of our story.<br /><br />Frankly, if it wasn't for the Curtises' usual wit and humor, this story would have gotten just plain zero from me.  At the start, David teasingly nicknames Frances, Prudence Sweetsteeple.  Well, I agree with the Pru part --- as in prunes (hyuk, hyuk).  I thought Frances was the most unfunny, starchy, unrealistic, prosy bore set on God's green England.  Geez.  Why hotties like David or Richard would fall for her is just beyond me.  Oh, the male mind --- or whatever they were using to think with.  I guess that answers the question, really, since Frances was real easy on the eyes.  Anyhoo, not being male, I just found her annoying and unlikable and how do you get around that to enjoy a story?  You can't and I didn't.dn't.    As always,  don't take my word for it, read 'em and weep.	2002-12-15

Then just the two of them become snowed in together at the office for the weekend and with no power they have to keep each other warm.  Sounds more prurient than it really gets --- they end the snow-in with Brandt just realizing that Joan is much more attractive than he had realized.

The story starts with good girl Amanda Bennet of the loving and large Bennet family (which rather loosely put me in mind of another famous Bennet family).  Amanda's father works for Colby Enterprises and, as a little girl she had a huge crush on Jarod Colby, wealthy heir of the town's richy-rich family.  However, after a brief, humiliating run-in with a snobby and rude Jarod in high school (shoulda been a hint here for her of things to come), she thought she was cured of her girlish fantasies.<br /><br />Then came the night of the yearly cotillion, and Jarod Colby is instantly attracted to the beautiful Amanda.  Amanda is swept off her feet, however, Jarod expects a sophisticated affair and Amanda wants love.  Jarod becomes angry and from this point blows hot and cold by turns.  Eventually, Amanda's father has a stroke and ends up in the hospital.  How to pay for all the bills?  She strikes a deal with Jarod who says he'll pay for everything if she marries him.<br /><br />Why marriage, I ask you?  Doesn't he have all the cards?  Sheez.  Anyway, from there a turbulent story takes a decided nose dive.  As if it wasn't bad enough already.  Now we've got an autocratic, brooding hero, and our heroine, tortured with love, goes from already spineless to a puddle of primordial ooze.  Jarod insists that he doesn't want children so of course Amanda ends up pregnant and he rejects her repeatedly while all she can do is cry and tell him how much she loves him.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but cycles of male contempt and a woman grovelling for love is not my idea of enthralling romance.  If you decide to read this, my advice is to buy the book so you can throw it around and alleviate some pent up frustration.  Sadly, I was reading the digital version.	2002-12-15

Her father has raised a champion racehorse, Rogue, and she is obsessed with the idea that wealthy Barrett King is out to get Rogue and shouldn't be allowed to have him.  Later, when Rogue is injured and has to be put down she blames it all on Barrett for no discernable reason.<br /><br />There is no real answer for why she hates him.  I suppose it is because she actually likes him.  I just don't know.  Barrett himself seems like a nice gentleman --- even paying a hospital bill for the penniless Dani when her father runs out on her (thinking it's for her own good).  Dani becomes a model and Barrett continues to try and look out for her and eventually they start a relationship.<br /><br />Why Barrett falls for Dani I'll never understand. Looks, I guess. Frankly, with all her childish temper tantrums, insane accusations, and all but flinging herself kicking and screaming on the floor sometimes I had to force myself to get through this one.	2002-12-15

Generations of Bonners have run the ranch for the absent owner, an English Baron.  Now the current Baron, Reese Talbot, has come to look over the ranch and clashes with Kit right from the start.  Kit, who dresses, talks, and acts like a man is extremely hostile toward the charming Reese, though he can't quite figure out why.<br /><br />Kit is hiding a secret which is the cause of her attitude towards life and Reese and, although they are attracted to each other, Kit finally succeeds in driving Reese away.  Having got her wish, Kit comes to regret her decisons and starts to grow up a little and overcome the bitterness of her past.  When Reese finally shows up a while later (as you knew he would) there is a entirely new Kit waiting for him.<br /><br />A charming story that somehow worked despite the almost feudal theme that would have been more natural in a historic rather than modern setting.  Taking place in an isolated small town somehow made it more believable.  At times I wanted to shake Kit for her childishness but seeing Kit learn to love and find happiness with good-guy Reese was just an awshucks feel-good ending.	2002-12-15

While she has plans to break free and become indpendent, she is always railroaded by guilt and ends up doing what LaRaine and her Aunt want.<br /><br />LaRaine is engaged to handsome, wealthy, autocratic Rian Montgomery.  Rian wants La Raine to visit his aunt before the wedding while he is out of the country but LaRaine wants to fulfill a lifelong dream and act in a movie.  LaRaine makes weak-willed Laurie pretend to be her and visit the aunt while she films the movie.  Laurie decides that this is the very last time she will do something crazy for LaRaine and her family and then she's going out on her own.<br /><br />Naturally, Rian makes an unexpected appearance at his Aunt's and finds Laurie there.  Laurie discovers that Rian and LaRaine's  relationship is something of a business arrangement (rather than love) and now he is determined to teach LaRaine and Laurie a lesson by marrying Laurie instead.<br /><br />Lots of glaring holes in the logic of the plot but with everyone grandly ignoring them, it's almost easy for us to ignore it too.  An autocratic, heartless, brooding hero type and a mousy-but-trying-to-be-more-assertive heroine --- I guess it had a sort of, I don't know, Rebecca-duMaurier old-world character sort of charm that kept my attention till the end.	2002-12-15

Now everyone is dead and gone leaving Liza travelling alone. Mistaken for a poacher, she is taken before Alex, Earl of Brockhaven and his brother Robert. Alex and Robert recognize the distinctive gold medallion she wears and eventually it is discovered that she is an heiress to a fortune since her grandfather was the Marquis of Chadbourne.<br />Her appearance also means that her cousin Isabella and her husband Vincent have lost the bulk of their fortune --- although they are by no means poor. Isabella is a famous beauty from h*** (the girl you'll luuuuuv to hate) and Vincent seems like an amiable gentleman and much put upon husband by comparison. By a quirk of fate, Alex is her legal guardian --- which works just fine for him since he has quite a history with Isabella and Vincent and has been waiting for just this opportunity for some well deserved payback. Yes, it's the ol' wolf-for-guardian-watching-ward-as-lamb ploy and provides ample opportunity for their increasing attraction to each other.<br />Speaking of wolves, along the way, werewolves and murder get mixed into the pot and Liza and her new friend, Ellen, get embroiled in scrapes that ---as always with the Curtises --- means some pretty good laughs. Robert fills what I call the Cat Role (fellow Windflower fans will know what I mean) well enough and, since this IS strictly a regency-type overall it's a pretty light story both in terms of emotions and love scenes, as it were. Still, gotta admit Eliza's swim in the pool was pretty memorable . . . but I digress.<br />I was rather torn between 3 and 4 stars for this one.

Disappointed by her love and angry with her father's plans for this marriage, Juana becomes even more reluctant when she discovers that the Duque is seriously flawed both physically and mentally.  The Duque's keeper is the foreigner, Felipe Tristan, who carries out both Castaneda's and his own plans for Juana.<br />While it moves a little slower than Teresa Denys' other book, 'Silver Devil', the story is similar in style.  The heroine is a stranger in a strange place full of court intrigue and plotting enemies.  There is a feeling that no one can be trusted and those who appeared to be allies are often revealed to have ulterior motives.  Felipe is ruthless in his pursuit of Juana and the better part of their relationship is one of bitter enmity.  Juana spends most of the book alternating between desperation, anger, and despair.  If you are looking for humor or gentle persuasion look elsewhere; there are none to be found in this story.<br />Therein, however, lies the attraction.  This type of storytelling seems very rare these days.  Teresa Denys is able to bring the time period alive in all it's dark, gothic glory unlike many stories where obviously 21st century thinking and speaking characters seem to have simply been stuck in costumes.  Like 'Silver Devil', I didn't particularly 'like' the hero (flawed, charismatic antihero) yet it is part of what made the story so compelling which is why I rated this book so highly.	2001-06-16

When Valentine's father dies, rather than go to her estranged grandparents she prefers to hit the open road (in disguise as a boy, naturally, thus the title) relying on her talent with horses to get by. She winds up working for Diccon Leyburn, an extremely charismatic and feudal-type lord and it is there that our story really begins. While this is the usual girl-disguised-as-boy type romance that we have seen since Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (which is quoted as chapter openers throughout the book), Joan Wolf does a great job re-telling this type of tale. Valentine doesn't lose her sense of humour or, more importantly, her backbone although she has come down with a serious case of hero-worship. Diccon, despite the feudal tendencies and some idiosyncrasies regarding Richard III, can also display quite a sense of humour himself and is more than adequate as our hero. One of my favorite Joan Wolf regencies, I highly recommend this one.	2001-06-15
