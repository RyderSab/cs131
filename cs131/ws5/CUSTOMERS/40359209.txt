After moving with her parents to Panama City, Florida away from Missouri where she grew up, 16-year-old Laura Duffy is not fitting in well as a Junior at Panama Beach High School lovingly called \\"Nama High\\" by the students. <br /> <br />Nama Beach High is written from Laura's point of view. Nancy Rue beautifully captures the nuances, language, and mixed-up thoughts and emotions of a typical teenager. She begins in chapter one with: <br /> <br />-------- <br />\\"I, Laura Duffy, made a decision on October 20th of my junior year. It was a decision that rocked my world. <br /> <br />After three days at Panama Beach High, it was obvious that I was essentially the biggest loser in Panama City, if not on the planet, and that nobody was ever going to speak to me. Period. <br /> <br />My decision: I couldn't spend another lunch period pretending I didn't CARE that I was being ignored. I knew kids believed being a loser was contagious; I believed it too. I wouldn't want to be friends with me either.\\" <br />------- <br /> <br />We immediately relate to Laura and remember our own teenage inadequacies and fears of starting a new school and wishing we'd somehow melt into the pavement and not be seen or heard \\" EVER! For me, 'Nama . . . reminded me of that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach when facing a new situation and being totally alone in the world. <br /> <br />We as adults have learned how to overcome our insecurities and we've gone on to conquer them (some of us have, that is). Poor Laura with \\"sparkling orthodontia\\" and \\"nerd\\" status because of her good grades is faced with total upheaval with none of her peer-group support to help her adjust and give her the confidence she needs to go on. <br /> <br />Laura is soon met with a violent encounter with two tough girls which leads her to the principal's office and an unwelcomed invitation from the school counselor, Mrs. Isaacsen. She then joins a group of four fellow misfits in Mrs. Isaacsen's \\"Mystery Group\\" and they begin meeting weekly. These four girls, Mrs. Isaacsen, and Laura form an unlikely bond which helps them learn about life, love, and friendships, their faith and the truths about God. And, Laura has a \\"Secret Admirer\\" who leaves her notes and curious items in her locker. There's the hint that there is also an angel sent from God to encourage her and help her grow in her faith. <br /> <br />-- reviewed by Susan J. Shelley for Christian Bookshelf	2004-09-07

A WOMAN AND HER GOD is collection of encouraging messages from well-known authors and speakers (Beth Moore, Jill Briscoe, Sandra D. Wilson, Kathleen Hart, Dr, David Hager, Thelma Wells, Bevery LaHaye, and Lori LaHaye Scheck). The goal of each message is to convey to the reader her \\"extraordinary\\" purpose. The messages are for married and single women as well as for the young and mature.  <br /> <br />Some of the messages that were tremendously enjoyed by this reviewer were:  <br /> <br />A WOMAN AND HER GOD:  <br />Popular bible study teacher, Beth Moore begins the series of messages with \\"A Woman and Her God.\\" Beth's down to earth style may be familiar to others and warmly received by new readers. While reading Beth's passionate message, readers may find themselves underlining or highlighting certain statements that really touch them.  <br /> <br />\\"We were meant to utterly devote ourselves to Him.\\" <br /> <br />\\"One thing that is so incredible about allowing our Father to meet our needs first thing in the day is that if our husband or friend showers us with love later on, our cup overflows. But it's not their job to intially meet the needs of our soul.\\"  <br /> <br />AS JESUS CARED FOR WOMEN:  <br />\\"It only takes a quick study of Scripture to discover that Jesus broke all the cultural codes of his time in terms of His treatment toward women.\\" The only male writer in the group, David Hager, M.D., provides a wonderful look at how Jesus interacted with women and fulfilled their needs. Dr. Hager points out several lessons that can be found in the Scripture such as respect (Luke 7:36-38) and love ( Mark 5:35-43). <br /> <br />BEING A GODLY WOMAN THROUGH EVERY STAGE OF LIFE:  <br />Kathleen Hart says, \\"Choose to be satisfied with Jesus and have His peace in this moment.\\" Kathleen encourages the reader to explore where she is at right now in her life with six poignant questions.  <br /> <br />The other writers cover such topics as a woman's role, self-concept, the spirit of unity and trusting God. This is a book you might want to keep as a copy or purchase as a gift for friends. The messages are definitely encouraging and worth reading again and again.  <br />  <br />--- reviewed by Tyora Moody for Christian Bookshelf	2004-09-07

It's a small, hard cover book that even has a built in book mark. I was curious about it because it's also a relatively short book. What could so few pages really hold? The cover claims that it's \\"A simple story that will touch your heart in a profound way.\\" Now that's a pretty tall order!  <br /> <br />So I opened the book and from the first sentence I was hooked. It's a simple story of a woman who's reaching the end of her life but has one last project in her: a quilt. I don't know if the story had a deeper effect on me because I see myself rapidly approaching that age or not. But even young people will be touched by the message of the quilt.  <br /> <br />As I was thinking about the review that I was going to write a hymn came to mind, \\"Stand up, stand up for Jesus.\\" There's a phrase in that hymn that speaks of putting each piece of gospel armor on with prayer. The whole idea behind that quilt was that each stitch was to be made with prayer. But not just any prayer, they were to be prayers of thanksgiving. As I read this book I was touched deeply. I challenge you to read this book and then fill your life with prayers of thanksgiving! <br /> <br />--- reviewed by Lynn Worley for Christian Bookshelf <br />	2004-09-06

In desperation, she marries a man she does not love thus becoming entrapped in a life of pretense. As she spirals downward toward rock bottom, she holds fast to the one constant force in her life, God. Richard Brian Botelho cleverly draws the reader along as Leah searches for her purpose.

It is always an exciting thing for me to find a new author that writes well and can tell a good story. That is exactly what I have found in Kacy Barnett-Gramckow, author of \\"THE GENESIS TRILOGY - THE HEAVENS BEFORE\\". <br /> <br />This story is about Noah's flood as seen through the eyes of one of his daughters-in-law, Shem's wife, Annah.  <br /> <br />The story begins with Annah amoungst her own people, in her own village on this side of the river. Her people are violent, self-centered, hateful people who are filled with greed, envy and strife.  <br /> <br />Annah is hated and mocked by all of them who consider her to be the village idiot because she has not spoken for nearly 25 years; ever since she witnessed the murder of her father when she was but 12 years old. She has found that the only way she can cope with her grief, fear and anger is to let them believe what they will. She avoids the company of everyone as much as possible and spends most of her time down by the riverside where she is soothed by the beauty and tranquility of creation. <br /> <br />Finally, though, after years of pent up grief over the loss of her father and the misery inflicted upon her by her people, she decides to fall into the river and allow it to end the futility of her life. But someone on the other side of the river sees her, understands what she is contemplating and is able to wordlessly convince her not to end her own life. This person becomes a point of light in her world of darkness and gives her hope again. <br /> <br />One night, as she secretly follows her sister-in-law through the forest to the hovel of the Nachash and her Whisperers (evil, witchy, serpent worshipers), Annah discovers that the Nachash fears only the Most High, convincing her that the legends of the Most High are true after all. She decides that if the Most High is the enemy of the Nachash, then she will believe in and follow Him. As she is discovered and threatened by death, she cries out to the Most High whodelivers her from harm and destroys the one out to kill her. <br /> <br />Great evil and violence takes the life of her mother and middle brother and she is beaten, nearly to death, by her father's murderer. As soon as she is able, she runs back to the river to find the one who has been so kind to her. When he sees her condition and the danger she is in, he sets out to free her from her abusers and take her to safety. Thus begins her new life on the other side of the river with Noah and his family. <br /> <br />Ms. Barnett-Gramckow has a wonder talent for painting marvelous imagery with her words. She captivates you with her literary skill right from the start and never disappoints. She brings life and new perspective to one of the Bible's most famous events and makes you long to read more by the time you are done. I can't wait for the 2nd in this series to come out; I am confident it will be equally as uplifting, insightful and entertaining as this wonderful tale has been. I hope you read this book and enjoy it as much as I have.  <br /> <br />--- reviewed by Ginny Sutton for Christian Bookshelf <br />	2004-09-06

When a professor at the local university dies, Ruby Taylor is hired to take his place. She soon finds out that working at the university is not all she dreams it will be. Is Dr. Aldridge's death really suicide as everyone suspects? Suspenseful events soon start Ruby thinking otherwise.  <br /> <br />Not long after Ruby starts her new job, her long-lost brother shows up in the early hours of the morning. At first, Ruby and her mother are convinced it is a prowler and call the police. The policeman who responds is none other than Wesley-Ruby's long-time love interest.  <br /> <br />Soon it becomes apparent that things aren't as they seem on the surface. Who is the man who showed up on Ruby's doorstep? Is it really her brother? Who is the person hanging out around Ruby's office late at night - and who breaks in when she is away from her desk? What are they looking for?  <br /> <br />SASSY CINDERELLA AND THE VALIANT VIGILANTE is an exciting page turning mystery. Readers will want to read the first book in the series Romance Rustlers and Thunderbird Thieves first as this book refers back to some of the previous events.  <br /> <br />Ruby is an adorably sassy heroine, and I hoped that she would be able to at least earn a date with her hero. Sort of a chick lit type of mystery, the reader is instantly drawn into the story. I am usually able to figure out who the perpetrator is pretty quickly, but SASSY CINDERELLA kept me guessing until the end.  <br /> <br />--- reviewed by Laura V.

Even though World War II has come to an end, little has changed in Berlin. While the Swastika has been replaced by the Hammer and Sickle, and soldiers by secret police, life of oppression and fear remains.  <br /> <br />When Mady Schumacher learns of the location of the six disabled orphans her now deceased husband, Josef, had cared for, Mady and a long-time friend, Konlon, dream up an elaborate plan to break the kids out of the mental institution they have been placed in. After they rescue the children, they hope to smuggle them over the Berlin Wall and eventually take them to America. Unfortunately, before they can even get the kids out the institution, things start to go wrong. Will what follows be a blessing or a curse?  <br /> <br />ABOVE ALL EARTHLY POWERS is a heart wrenching story about the struggles which residents of East Berlin faced behind the Berlin Wall. The characters in the story are very well developed, instantly drawing the reader in. You become acquainted and fall in love with blind `Tomcat' and follow him around as he is able to escape the mental institution and find his friends, tell them where he and the other five have been hidden, and then his return back to the institution to wait for `the rescue'.  <br /> <br />Even though ABOVE ALL EARTHLY POWERS is book three in the Songs of the Night series, it easily stands alone. Readers might want to pick up the first two books While Mortals Sleep and His Watchful Eye just to find out what happened prior to this story though. While the Berlin Wall was in existence since before I was born, I do remember the day it came down. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, they have a portion of the wall on display, and it was awesome to be able to touch a huge piece of history like that. Having experienced the sheer magnitude of the `small piece' of the wall that the museum had, it had to be a daunting job to dream up escape attempts and then try to carry them out with armed guards ready to shoot without warning. <br /> <br />--- reviewed for Christian Bookshelf by Laura V.

My family was in the deep clutches of grief, having lost five members of our immediate family (a mother, father, sister, and two aunts) all within only 10 months and two of them within only 8 days. In this book Ms. Brownley fills us with inspiration, uplifting our grieving hearts, and gives us beautiful Haiku poetry written by Diantha Ain, and Scripture verses. The words of deep wisdom seem to come directly from God, touching our deeply grieving souls, showing us what He wants from us and for us and how much he loves us. <br /> <br />Even the texture and feel of the book is comforting. As soon as I picked it up and ran my fingers across its pages, I felt deep peace entering my very soul. The pages are very smooth and bright, the cover is beautifully done -- a picture of bellowing clouds back lighted by the sun and a promising rainbow; the print is large which makes it very easy on the eyes. Each chapter is only one or two pages in length and can be read either as a daily devotional or all at one sitting. I recommend reading it as a daily devotional and savoring every thought and emotion it brings to mind before starting the next chapter. Then start your own journal to record your grief journey. <br /> <br />This is a beautifully written book of healing comfort and helpful advice plus it's filled with Ms. Brownley's own deep feelings and grief experiences of losing a child. She also gives us some very innovative and profound thoughts about our feelings and how we handle this thing called grief. She takes us outside the box and expands our emotions and makes us face grief, standing tall, steady, and ready to bear it. Ms. Brownley shows us the never-ending grace God has for each of us, especially during our grieving process. I highly recommend this book and suggest you buy several to give away to a grieving person. Handing them a copy of Grieving God's Way speaks volumes instead of handing them a bunch of emptywords. <br /> <br />\\"A part of you is missing,\\" Ms. Brownley writes. \\"So how do we function like a whole person? We start by paying attention to those around us. None of us knows what the future might hold. Each moment, each day is precious and can never be replaced. We can and must be whole again -- even when the gaping hole inside feels like the Grand Canyon. Our surviving loved ones deserve no less from us. Each day we give in to our brokenness is one less day that we give to the people we care about. Each day lived in the past is one less day to build a future. Each day of despair is one less day of joy. Each day consumed by anger is one less day to love.\\" <br /> <br />--- reviewed by Susan J. Shelley for Christian Bookshelf	2004-09-06

TOGETHER IS ALL WE NEED, by Michael Phillips, would be a great read for young, teenaged girls. The story line is very simple and straightforward and obviously written for the less than mature audience. It is the fourth book in THE SHENANDOAH SISTERS series and should be read as the fourth book. When read out of sequence, it is sorely lacking in character development. Within the first chapter, I realized that I had definitely missed something and then discovered that, as I suspected, it was one of a series. I could tell though, that the story line was a continuation of a very interesting scenerio, an uncommon tale of tragedy, heroism, and redemption. <br /> <br />Katie and Mayme have discovered that they are unlikely cousins. They are both teenagers and are forced, for the sake of their own survival, and with the help of a few friends, to take on the responsibility and hard work of adults; maintaining and running a productive cotton farm. Their current situation must be kept a secret and those in the community must be led to believe that everything is as it should be on their farm. Eventually, their secret is discovered by the brother of Katie's father, her Uncle Burchard. When he learns the truth, he sets out to take the farm from them. But God is faithful and provides for their needs by another unexpected turn of events. <br /> <br />TOGETHER IS ALL WE NEED successfully demonstrates that love knows no boundaries and is not affected by the prejudices of man. The girl's faith in God and love for each other pays off in the end in a big way. If you have a young teenage girl, or know one, you would do well to recommend this series to them or give as a gift. <br /> <br />-- reviewed by Ginny Sutton for Christian Bookshelf	2004-09-06

The book consists of twelve questions and answers such as: <br />- Who is prayer said to? <BR>- Does a prayer have to have special words? <BR>- Is there a special time to pray? <br />Parents will find this book format to be excellent for their inquisitive little ones. Adults may benefit from the clear, simple language as well! <br />In this series of the books, the illustrations are superb. <br />Q: If you ask God for things, do you get them? <br />For example, the illustration under this question is a great learning tool. An excited little boy stares longingly at a shiny red bicycle in the store window. On the next page, the little boy has decided to get a ball that was in the same store window. He is having loads of fun playing ball with his friends! Very nice way of downplaying the \\"give me\\" attitude, but instead emphasizing God is about love and sharing. This book series definitely provides great teaching as well as cool reading! <br />--- reviewed by Tyora Moody for Christian Bookshelf	2004-05-30

This book is the first in the Silver Hills Trilogy and I have to admit, I really enjoyed this book. It's about Letitia Morgan, a young female doctor trying to find her way in the booming silver mining town of Hartville, Colorado in 1892. All her life, Letty has never fit in anywhere but she knows that God has called her to be a doctor and to help anyone she can. Unfortunately for Letty female doctors, especially those that are spinsters, are not well liked in this town and she must fight an uphill battle. Especially when she starts ministering to the town's undesirables. But she knows God's call on her life is strong and she's willing to risk everything on what she knows is right. <br />But will she risk Erik Wagner, the tall handsome newspaper man who has stolen her heart? Can she heal him of a hurt that he is not willing to let go?<br />If you are looking for a really good romance novel that will make you laugh, get mad and will melt your heart than I fully recommend this one. I also appreciated the the strong Christian morality in this book. I can't wait to read the next book in this series.<br />--- reviewed by Laurie Jones for Christian Bookshelf	2004-05-30

It takes place in the American Revolutionary War and is about Angus McDonald, a British redcoat who falls in love with Georgia colonist Rachel Martin. Angus and Rachel only had a week with each other but it was enough for their love to grow. Then a war separated them and they did not know if they would ever see each other again. Will their faith in God and their faith in each other stand the test of time and circumstances? You will have to read the book to find out.<br />I really liked the character of Angus. He is a strong Christian man with strong convictions that are sorely tested. He can also be as gentle as a lamb when the need arises. He finds himself in very difficult situations where he must choose between what is morally right and what is very close to his heart.<br />I would have liked to rate this book higher but unfortunately I was very uncomfortable with the author's use of sexual intimacy. Perhaps I am too old-fashioned but as a reader I would rather be left at the closed door than in the bedroom with a couple.<br />I do believe that this author has a lot of potential. It is obvious that she worked hard on her research and worked hard on writing this book. I look forward to reading future books that she has written.	2004-05-30

Stephen Lang, author of The Complete Book of Bible Trivia has put together a collection of bible stories that he describes as &quot;truly bizarre&quot;. The author has chosen stories that entertain and in some instances, horrify the reader. The main purpose of this book is to &quot;put to rest&quot; the idea the bible is a boring book of history. After each story Lang summarizes the spiritual lessons that can be obtained as a result of strange events, situations or an individual's downfall. In our &quot;crazy&quot; world today it is good to look back at the human experience historically, as Lang often states, there are lessons to be learned.<br />This book is great reading material for those who have either read or heard these stories from Sunday School or personal bible study.

In 1812, Erica Langston's father owns a thriving business and provides his family with a comfortable home. They show no outward signs of the struggles and fears faced by her Acadian forbearers. Everything is perfect in Erica's world. Her dad entrusts her with the business' financial matters, since her brother has no head for numbers, and she has discovered a new business venture her family will profit in. Then one terrible morning when the family is still eating breakfast, British soldiers march on the city of Washington to torch government buildings, the beginnings of the War of 1812. Someone sets fire to the Langston business and in the ensuing panic; her father is hit over the head by a British soldier and dies in Erica's arms. <br />British Major Gareth Powers will never forget the beautiful girl who confronted him in the streets of Washington after her father's tragic death at the hands of his men. He hadn't given any orders to attack civilians or non-government buildings, but in the panicking masses crowding the streets, he could hardly be held responsible. His men have orders to attack the American government and the civilians are hindering the British from carrying the orders out. Even after Gareth returns to England and takes a job as a printer, he still remembers the young American woman's grief. <br />After her father's death, Erica's family business struggles. She discovers the British still owe her father money and she needs it for the family to survive. She takes a trip to England, hoping to recoup her family's gold. A U.S. diplomat in the Court of St. James puts her in contact with Gareth and his friends. When the banker refuses to listen to her pleas for the money, Erica tells Gareth her troubles and he introduces her to the one man who might be able to help. Will he be able to? What will Erica have to do to get her family's gold? Who has placed a price on her head? <br />I read the Song of Acadia series which Mr. Bunn co-wrote with Janette Oke. WhenI received this book, I had no idea it would be a continuation of this series. The first book of a new series, Heirs of Acadia, THE SOLITARY ENVOY is a must read for those who read and loved the Song of Acadia series. THE SOLITARY ENVOY easily stands alone, so even those who haven't read the previous series will not feel left out. <br />Even though Erica is likeable, I found her a bit larger than life. In 1812, women didn't have the rights men did and I thought it a bit unrealistic that she could go into businesses and expect to be listened to. She took over in many areas and was everyone's answers to prayer, which is a bit far fetched. Gareth, on the other hand, is a loveable hero, even if he was a bit sickly after the war. I hoped Erica would be able to recover her family's gold and forgive Gareth for being there when her father was killed. <br />Readers will enjoy THE SOLITARY ENVOY and will want to watch for the sequel THE INNOCENT LIBERTINE due out in the fall. I couldn't put this book down, and highly recommend it to anyone who likes historical Christian women's fiction. <br />--- reviewed by Laura Hilton for Christian Bookshelf	2004-03-14

Reading each chapter is like having an intimate conversation with the artist. They talk about their lives as performers, wives, mothers, and friends. Each chapter is based on one of their hit songs along with Scripture and how God has worked in their lives and music. At the end of each chapter, there's a one-page study guide with a Scripture, a few questions to ponder, and lined space to jot down your thoughts. <br />For example:<br />Chapter 1 I'll Be Believing <br />Denise Jones shares a poignant story about a &quot;flying cat&quot; and how God used that cat to answer a little girl's prayer. Denise states, &quot;It's a picture of how God works. . . he's not so distracted . . . that he is unable to hear the petitions of a child.&quot; Referring to the song, I'll Be Believing, she affirms, &quot;As the song says, 'Out here on my own, I won't be alone.' Why? Because the God of the heavens promises to never, ever leave us.&quot;<br />Chapter 2 One More Broken Heart <br />Shelley Breen talks about hell and being on the road and losing sight of all the cities and places they've been. That life on the road becomes a blur. There was one town, however, that vividly stayed in her mind &quot;Hell, Michigan. [No kidding!] &quot;And, as you might expect,&quot; Shelley writes, &quot;the highway to Hell is paved with crass signs telling you where to go.&quot; She also said &quot;. . . people from neighboring towns often go to Hell when mailing their taxes to the IRS or alimony payments to a former spouse.&quot; And, people often sent postcards from Hell. In her study questions, she asks, &quot;Do you have any neighbors, friends, or family members who don't know the Lord?&quot;<br />Chapter 3 Jesus Will Still Be <br />There Heather Payne tells about how the group got started and how they managed to stay together for the past 12 years during the good times and the dark, cloudy days, and through the wedding ceremonies that temporarily separated them but never pulled them apart. Their group has a mission and a ministry. God gave each of them their spiritual gift to sing His words to the world.<br />I encourage you to check out this book!<br />--- reviewed by Susan Shelley for Christian Bookshelf	2004-03-14

In the second novel, from her Refiner's Fire series, Lynn Austin spins a captivating tale of two unlikely heros caught up in the horrors of the Civil War. This one is even better than its prequel, Candle in the Darkness. <br />In Fire by Night, Mrs. Austin, most successfully, parallels two seperate plots that converge beautifully as the lives of two women, from opposite ends of society, are brought together amidst the living hell of the battlefield.<br />Julia Hoffman, the spoiled, self-centered daughter of Judge Hoffman is smitten by the young and good looking Reverend Nathaniel Greene. But after her behavior while observing the battle at Bull Run, Reverend Greene wants nothing to do with her. Her pride is sorely wounded when she overhears Nathaniel discussing her with Congressman Rhoades, an influential friend of her father. \\"Forgive me for being so blunt, but I find it to be a true assessment of most of the young ladies in Miss Hoffman's social position. They can't--or won't--do a thing for themselves, whether it's combing their own hair or fixing a cup of tea....Outward beauty rarely lasts a lifetime, Congressman, and then what would I be left with once it fades? A whining, nagging wife wrapped up in her own needs, whose only passions are spending money and spreading gossip?\\"<br />His words are the catylyst that send Julia into a world of the unknown where she discovers the true meaning of being a Christian.<br />Phoebe, named after her dead mother, has never known what it's like to love or be loved. Raised by her backwoods father and three older brothers, \\"Ike\\", the name her father gave her after her mother died, is the tom-boy of all tom-boys. She inherited her father's genes and is the tallest woman for miles around. She's a sharp-shooter from years of hunting with her brothers and can hold her own as they wrestle and fight with her like she was \\"one of the boys\\". She never wears a dress, just the hand-me-downs of her strapping brothers. When her Pa dies andthe boys all go off to fight the Rebels, she is left to work for her room and board taking care of mean ole' Mrs. Haggerty's children. There are so many unruley kids running in and out she can't even get a count of just how many there are! By the time her first day is over, she knows she'll never survive it! She has to run away...but where will she go? Then an idea hits her...she just might get away with it if she cuts her hair short enough and puts her brother's old clothes back on!<br />I haven't read a book I've enjoyed as much as this one in a good while. I highly recommend it. You don't have to read the first one to completely enjoy this one on its own merits but I'm recommending the whole series; I'm really looking forward to the next installation. Lynn Austin is a very good writer. Her stories are not common, she always has a surprise up her sleeves. Hidden Places is another one of her books that I really enjoyed...ah...but that's another story! <br />--- reviewed by Ginny Sutton for Christian Bookshelf	2004-03-14

Tenney's fascination resulted in writing Hadassah: One Night With the King, a fictional but biblical sound novel based on the book of Esther. Readers will find a fresh and exciting spin on the familiar story by the writing team of Tenney and Mark Andrew Olsen.<br />The story begins in present day Israel where a young woman, Hadassah, named after her &quot;great&quot; grandmother of centuries before, is being presented with a very special wedding gift. As a family tradition, an ancient heirloom was to be revealed to a bride during her wedding week. This secretly hidden heirloom was a letter written by Queen Esther (Haddassah).<br />Some of the sketchy areas in the bible, Tenney has taken creative license to fill in such details as how Mordecai becomes Esther's legal guardian. Weaved into the story are history lessons on the hatred spewed on the Jews by the Amakelites, the crude manner in which young men were made eunuchs and women concubines, and the sense of power behind the kingship of King Xerxes. Readers will be thrilled to read this rich history in between being enchanted by Esther humble approach to her &quot;one&quot; night with King Xerxes.

At first, this reviewer didnt think much of the book, but as the story progressed, the book became increasingly difficult to put down. The story line is impressive.

Is it unimportant to her? Determined to find out if her parent's faith is truth or fantasy, Mac starts studying the Bible on his own. What happens when he finds a faith in God and Cassie has trouble believing in her parent's God? Is it too late for Cassie to give up the lifestyle she's picked up in college? Does she even want to try? And what about when Mac runs into an insurmountable obstacle? Will he be able to keep his new faith?<br />TRIALS OF FAITH is an interesting story about facing life away from home for the first time. Cassie runs into a lot of the same situations and tests as most first time college students and must decide whether the beliefs she was raised with are worth keeping. I was a bit impatient with Cassie's attitude toward her family, but she had the typical teenager mindset-she is the only one who matters. <br />There is a lot of head hopping in TRIALS OF FAITH, making it sometimes difficult for the reader to follow. There is also a lot of telling instead of showing, so the story doesn't flow very smoothly. Otherwise, the author had a good story line and a message that needs to be heard by all teens. I recommend TRIALS OF FAITH for a cute love story with faith at the base. <br />-- reviewed by Laura V. Hilton for Christian Bookshelf	2004-01-16

Recently, my husband was diagnosed with dementia and depression while I am plagued with migraine headaches, loss of balance and dizziness; therefore, I devoured this little book from cover to cover and have already started using the remedies and practical advice to help my husband and me improve our memory and mental acuity.<br />Trends in book publishing today are books on the topics of health, natural healing, herbs, and eating healthier foods. Memory and mental acuity -- including age-related memory loss, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease -- affect a growing number of people since the baby-boomer generation is now reaching its senior years. The baby boomers are buying books on health and healing. In this jewel of a pocket-sized book, Reginald B. Cherry, M.D., discusses headaches, loss of balance and dizziness, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression and anxiety, dementia, Alzheimer's disease and age-related memory loss. He also shows us how God provides the natural remedies to help us along the pathway of healing our body, mind, and spirit.<br />Dr. Cherry writes in his introduction, \\"As statistical data is showing a rise in many of these ailments, these concerns are very valid. We need to get more knowledge in these areas, but we also need to know that God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind. God's plan for all of us includes having a sound mind until the day we go home to be with Him. It is good to know that God has a pathway for each of us to maintain a healthy memory and a sharp mind.\\"<br />This little book is filled with scripture and practical advice concerning symptoms, causes, and cures -- both natural and medically prescribed. Dr. Cherry also discusses staying active and engaged, uses of Ginkgo Biloba, gingeroot, garlic, Ginseng, iron and zinc, antioxidants, brain foods, anti-inflammatories, plant derived estrogens, caffeine, peppermint oil, horseradish, relaxation, Ritalin, omega fatty acids and other nutrients, vitamins and supplements. In each section he also lists what foods to eat and what foods to avoid.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who has either experienced memory loss themselves or knows someone who already has significant memory loss. It's also good for those who wish to keep their memory acute and desire to use preventive measures. Dr. Cherry will tell you, \\"Linda and I are standing with you as you seek God's pathway to healing for memory and mental acuity and as you walk in His pathway to total healing for your life.\\" <br />--- reviewed by Susan J.

Ten-year-old Timmy Hansen watches his mother being buried and wonders what's going to happen to him now. His relatives don't want him. A short time later, he finds himself on the streets, being beat up by street urchins who don't want another mouth to feed. A nice policeman, Jake Smith, takes Timmy to the orphanage. <br />Thirteen-year-old identical twin sisters, Donna and Deena Mitchell, are kicked out of their home when their mother discovers she's having another baby. Soon they find themselves begging for food on the streets, trying to survive.<br />When policeman Jake Smith is killed in the line of duty, his own son, twelve-year-old, Johnny, is taken to the orphanage as well. He and Timmy become fast friends.<br />Soon, these four children find themselves on an orphan-train going west. They hope they'll find good homes and families to love them and won't just be used as slave labor. <br />ALL MY TOMOROWS is a wonderfully written story, with lots of truth to it. While sad at times, it is real, because not all of the orphans did end up in good homes. <br />I recommend ALL MY TOMORROWS for a wonderful read that takes you down a rough path through the past. It is evident that Al and Joanna Lacy did their research. ALL MY TOMORROWS is a must read, and will be a keeper for your library. Even though this is book two in The Orphan Train Trilogy, ALL MY TOMORROWS easily stands alone. <br />--- reviewed by Laura V. Hilton for Christian Bookshelf	2003-09-23

We need regular rest in order to maintain ourselves as whole, healthy women!&quot; (Page 13)<br />In today's busy life, women, especially Christian women, don't often take the time to rest. We are busy with our careers, our families, our friends, and our church. We look at the Bible, point to the Proverbs 31 woman, and think, &quot;Wow, she was so awesome, she never rested, and she accomplished so much!&quot;<br />But as Denise George points out in her devotional book COME TO THE QUIET the Proverbs 31 woman was a wise woman. She took time to rest spiritually, mentally, and physically. If a woman doesn't rest, she'll soon have a breakdown, either mentally or physically. <br />In COME TO THE QUIET, Denise George teaches us that we need to turn the televisions and radios off. We need to retreat to an area of silence in order to connect fully with God. Noise is a dangerous thing, often drowning out the voice of God in our lives.<br />COME TO THE QUIET is a very deep book. I could only read a little at a time, and then had to sit and think about what Ms. George was saying. I often find her comments coming to mind even after finishing the book, and share them with my husband. If you are looking for an escape from the busy world we live in, I highly recommend COME TO THE QUIET. You will learn how to find the quiet in the midst of the chaos. With the holidays approaching way too fast, COME TO THE QUIET is the book to read.<br />--- reviewed by Laura V. Hilton for Christian Bookshelf	2003-09-23

What happened to my baby after he/she died? Will I ever see my baby again-and will I recognize him? What happens if I've had an abortion? Does God have a reason for letting my child die? How can I help a friend who's in grief?<br />These are some of the questions addressed in this thought provoking book. Pastor Jack Hayford approaches the subject in a manner which makes the reader feel he truly empathizes with the situation. <br />As Pastor Hayford says in his book, \\"This isn't myth, fable, legend, or a selection of poetic thoughts for the sorrowful. This is truth to set us free. Here we are specifically freed to expect to meet children in heaven, to recognize them and to be with them.\\"<br />I've had three miscarriages, and wish I'LL HOLD YOU IN HEAVEN had been available for me to read when I was recovering. Not everyone understands what the mother is going through as some offer inane remarks that are not always comforting. In I'LL HOLD YOU IN HEAVEN, Pastor Hayford offers encouragement not only to the mom who miscarried, but also to the parent who lost a baby days or weeks after birth, and to the woman who aborted her baby and later regrets her decision.<br />If you know someone who recently lost a baby or if you're going through that sorrow yourself, I'LL HOLD YOU IN HEAVEN is a great book to read. It's a book which should be in every church library so it can minister to those hurting. A Remembrance book is also available. I recommend I'LL HOLD YOU IN HEAVEN. <br />--- reviewed by Laura V.

Leah Ebersol and her beloved, Jonas Mast, find themselves separated for six months, when Jonas agrees to take an apprenticeship in Ohio; a long way from where they grew up in Pennsylvania. Desperate to go to him, Leah instead stays home with her sister, Sadie, when Sadie gives birth to a baby boy she believes died at birth. Later, when Leah again gets the opportunity to go to Jonas, she sends Sadie instead, since Sadie is in such deep despair.<br />Confident in their love, Leah and Jonas happily plan their up-coming marriage by writing letters. Leah is busy trying to find suitable housing in Pennsylvania, and Jonas concentrates on fulfilling his apprenticeship. They write each other faithfully, each looking forward to the time they can be together.<br />But the Ebersol family is hiding some horrific secrets. Secrets, which if they should come out, would ruin lives. Rumors abound, and Leah doesn't know what to believe. When some of these rumors reach Jonas, he searches for the truth.<br />Will Jonas find the truth? Or will he reach out to his faithful Leah who must face the rumors and the horrible truth alone? Will Sadie repent of her sins or face a severe shunning?<br />THE BETRAYAL is book two in the Abram's Daughters' series. I recommend reading THE COVENANT, book one, before reading THE BETRAYAL, because the events in the books are so closely tied together. Leah, Sadie, and the other two sisters, Hannah and Mary are very well developed and pull at the reader's heartstrings. I couldn't believe anyone could have as many horrible things happen to them as Leah and Sadie and still survive. It seemed like things really should start looking up, but things kept going wrong, and you wonder if Jonas and Leah would ever find happiness. There are more books in this series; Beverly Lewis leaves a lot of ends untied in this book. I was hoping that some of the questions and problems in THE COVENANT would be answered in THE BETRAYAL, instead Beverly Lewis leaves even more unanswered. I am going to be anxiously awaiting the next book in this series, and hope I don't have to wait long! Beverly Lewis is one of my favorite authors. She has everything in her books; mystery, suspense, and romance.<br />--- reviewed by Laura V. Hilton for Christian Bookshelfnswered.

The most useful aspect of the book is the collection of fit tips that end each chapter and the focus on eating unprocessed foods. The tips include nutritional and spiritual suggestions that help people to improve the health of their entire being. <br />Healthy eating, natural grains, fruits, decreasing sugar intake, and other basic nutritional topics are explained thoroughly. After reading this book, readers will want to start baking their own bread and throw away the ice cream. All of these are great ideas. God's people should take advantage of the wonderful creation he provided and eat foods more closely related to those eaten by Adam and Eve. Processed and packaged foods lack the fresh taste of garden grown vegetables, orchard fruits, and hormone-free meats.<br />Each chapter of Fit for Eternity contains a spiritual problem linked to a physical problem, Dr. Little's dietary and spiritual recommendations, and the results. Unfortunately, every human being's situation is unique. The dietary recommendations change for each person, which is great for Dr. Little's clients, but not helpful for the reader. A reader cannot pick an appropriate diet for herself. <br />The spiritual techniques could be helpful for readers to use if they can discern the root of their own spiritual problems. Dr. Little's patients needed her help to uncover their spiritual problems and many readers will need outside help to locate them as well.<br />Seeing the whole-body impact of Dr. Little's therapy is encouraging. Hope is out there, but most practitioners of alternative and holistic health techniques are not Christians. Reading this book proves that a combination of proper eating and spiritual health heals the body, but does little to fill the need for nutritional and spiritual Christian advice.<br />--- reviewed by Terri Pilcher for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

The husband and wife writing team behind the pen name Hannah Alexander have struck gold with Book Two of the Healing Touch Series. Personally, this reviewer has not read the first book in this series, but found this did not effect the reading experience. Those that have read the first book are reintroduced to some of Dogwood Springs citizens. The authors do a great job of catching the first time reader up with background information.<br />Grant Sheldon, the ER director, at Dogwood Springs Hospital, and his twins Beau and Brooke have setted into their new home. Life has had it's difficulties adjusting to the loss of wife and mother, Anette. Grant and his children have grown to love family friend and nurse, Lauren McCaffery. The relationship between Lauren and the Sheldon family becomes more intertwined when Grant goes out of town, leaving the twins in Lauren's care. The growing drug problem in Dogwood Springs hits too close to home as Beau, Brooke and their friend are endangered.<br />The pace of the ER was reminiscent of some of today's hottest medical shows on television. Reading the details proved to be very exhilerating especially as the emotions ran high among the staff members. At the same time while the hospital scenes were fast paced, other scenes such as those between Grant and Lauren were favorably slower. The slower pace will allow readers a chance to build up an ernest desire for these two individuals to break past the boundaries of their friendship. Looking forward to the next book in this series! <br />--- reviewed by Tyora Moody for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

The Covenant is the tale of Abram and Ida Ebersol two oldest daughters, Sadie and Leah, during their rumschpringe. This is a time when Amish teens are allowed to run wild and free before taking their baptismal vows. <br />Sadie, the eldest of the Ebersol's four daughters, is making her vows in the fall, and she is not at all sure this is the path she wants. Truth be told she has been sneaking into town asking for trouble. She knows her parents would be shamed if they knew where she had been, but this doesn't seem to bother Sadie in the least. Especially after the night she meets the fancy English boy, Derry. She could not stay away from this boy who whispered sweet nothings in her ear. Sadie at first does not understand the danger that everyone tries to warn her against, but it is not long before Sadie learns first hand what can happen when you are lead astray from God by temptation. <br />Unlike Sadie, Leah, the second oldest, was not raised to woman's work in the house but to man's work out side with her father. She has always been her father's son since her parents did not have any boys. As Leah watches her sister Sadie going through her rumschpringe, she begins to worry about her sister, but all she seems to get from Sadie these days is indifference. Not knowing what else to do, she starts to look forward to her own upcoming rumschpringe. Her father has it in his sites that she will marry the Smithy's son, but unfortunately Leah has another boy in mind. How can she break the news to her father without breaking his heart? <br />As Sadie and Leah are both going through their rumschpringe, they both learn that some times you can not stop the fall, but you can be there to help pick up the pieces. <br />Beverly Lewis has brought her readers a wonderful heartwarming story of two teenage girls, who learn first hand the heartbreaking consequences of going astray from God and family. Sadie and Leah are two characters that readers will not soon forget. Throughout this story the reader is allowed to see how the Amish lifestyle is built on their love for God. This reviewer must admit she was a little shocked by the turn of events in the end of the book. However this reviewer was not disappointed. For fans of Beverly Lewis The Covenant is a must read! <br />--- reviewed by JoAnn Miller for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

As one studies the history of the early Christian church recorded in the New Testament, several names become familiar. Two of these names are Aquila and Priscilla, the married couple that worked along side the apostle Paul. Richard Soule cleverly writes a historical fiction novel with this couple at the forefront. Spanning from A.D. 28 to A.D. 78, Soule brings the early Christian movement alive in truly a unique way.<br />Archeologist Tess Swift illegally swipes an ancient scroll with the hopes of selling it to the highest bidder. Once she unravels the scroll, her life becomes intertwined with the contents of the scroll. Aquila and Priscilla have carefully recorded their experiences. Readers will become so emersed in the rich historical storyline you almost forget that you are reading this along with Tess. While fictional, Soule sticks very close to details such as the visitation of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2), Paul's Damascus road experience and his work with Gentiles, the persecutions, the great fire in Rome, etc. Expect to meet Peter, John, Timothy, and host of other names mentioned in the book of Acts.<br />Some of the interesting highlights are how Aquila and Priscilla come together as a couple. There love is truly an example for all married couples! It is also a great joy to see how the early Christians banded together to worship and support one another.<br />Soule pulls Tess away from the scroll from time to time. Each time Tess examines her life --- past and present --- the written lives of the individuals included in the scroll influence her in ways she never imagined. The last portion of this book is very emotional as horrible persecutions are witnessed via the pages of this book and at the same time a young woman draws closer to Christ. <br />The experience from reading this book will definitely remain with you long after the last page has been read. Soule encourages us all to stretch our imaginations and read the bible with new eyes. These people were REAL,even more importantly the God they served and worshipped is REAL and LIVES today!<br />--- reviewed by Tyora Moody for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

Imagine you have just celebrated your twelfth wedding anniversary. Life is wonderfully beautiful -- until one day, out of the blue -- the past comes back to haunt you in the worst way possible. This happens to David and Abby Treasure.<br />David has an announcement for Abby, his wife of 12 years. The results of his announcement will bring to light heartache and pain that ordinarily tear even the strongest married couple apart. Abby Treasure finds out her husband had an affair nine years ago while she was pregnant with their son. The woman David had an affair with calls him requesting a meeting. At this meeting, David finds out he has a little girl that he never knew about. Even more devastating, the little girl has leukemia and is in desperate need of a bone marrow transplant. David and his son are prime candidates as donors.<br />With extraordinary writing, Deborah Bedford delivers a novel that will move the reader emotionally and spiritually. Forgiveness and redemption are powerfully displayed as Abby comes to grips with David's betrayal and the \\"other\\" woman, whose child is dying. While this book is fictional, the themes that run througout the novel can surely encourage a real-life married couple going through heartaches in their own marriage.<br />--- reviewed by Tyora Moody for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

I'm recommending it to all my friends and it is a welcomed addition to my 'lending library' shelves.<br />Sutter's Cross is a lovely, picturesque town in the mountains of northern Georgia where &quot;the last long fingers of the Appalachians&quot; end. It was named after the huge chestnut cross erected by Emanual Sutter, in 1817, as the headstone for the grave of his beloved son . Emanuel had been given the land as payment for service in the War of 1812.<br />People in Sutter's Cross were very comfortable with the way things were in their town until a homeless hicker named Harley showed up at the Community Church's annual picnic. It was as if Harley's arrival triggered a domino of events that, spiritually speaking, separated the men from the boys.<br />Mr. Cramer masterfully introduces a variety of characters and makes you feel like you know each one intimately. Some of the characters are most lovable and some you love to dislike. In reality, they hold a mirror up to the reader as each one demonstrates a different aspect of who each of us really is.<br />I was amazed at how skillfully the author was able to create, and very successfully manage, several important themes. He addresses difficult father/son relationships, racial tensions, faith in the midst of illness and tragedy, and the ugliness of self-righteousness and ungodly judgements against others. Never did I feel lost or confused. Each issue was equally engaging, making me anxious to follow it through to it's satisfying conclusion.<br />Most of all I was thrilled at how real and down to earth Harley was. He was such an obvious God-send that I was suspicious of his true identity only to find that he was so real; an honest human in need of redemption just like me.<br />Please, do yourself a favor and read this book. I'm sure it will have an equally positive affect on you as it did on me. You'll be glad you did and you'll want to pass it on to those you care about. <br />--- reviewedby Ginny Sutton for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

Life that is worth the giving! The author, James Haywood Rolling, Jr., has written this book as God's call to each of us to live an important life - a life destined for us by God. It follows the general themes of chapter 12 of Romans in the New Testament. Within its twelve chapters, Part 1 of the book views the fullness of God's sacrificial mercy; Part 2 shows God's provision for us; Part 3 reveals the power and authority we have to fight against evil. Our fight is against Satan's power over us. By putting on the armor of God vividly spelled out for us in the Bible and in this book, we can win the war.<br />The book is well written, easy to understand, and filled with wonderful scripture verses and thought-provoking parables and vignettes taken from the author's own life. He also opens each chapter with his own original poetry which is filled with deep emotion and stark reality. Each chapter ends with a special STOP AND THINK message that can be adapted to the reader's life to help live a life without self-importance, self-reliance, and self-indulgence â\\" A LIFE WORTH GIVING. Mr. Rolling has a command of the written word and writes in artistically vivid imagery as if he's painting his words upon a canvas. He opens his heart and his life to us and we can see his pain, his recovery, and his revelation. This is not another one of those dry, boring, 10-step, self-help books. This is the blossoming of a life once filled with &quot;self&quot; into one of God's ambassadors ready for a ministry. Mr. Rolling's spiritual gift as an artist is evident in his verbiage and writing style. <br />I recommend this book to all Christian readers interested in learning how to walk a closer walk with their Lord and Savior and to view their lives with their eyes turned away from themselves and back onto God. Despite the fact that the book is well written, there are, however, a few proofreading errors. I would have given this book four stars if it wasn't for these errors! If the reader can overlook these, this makes a great read and study guide for the Christian's daily life. <br />--- reviewed by Susan J. Shelley for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

In her book, Seasons of a Woman's Life, Lois Evans breaks down the spiritual disciplines in each stage in a simple, yet enriching, way.<br />She uses Queen Esther as a universal woman to which all Christians can relate. Pieces of Esther's life are pulled out, examined, and placed with a stage of womanly spiritual growth. Mrs. Evans then uses scripture to teach the righteous response to the trials of each growth phase.<br />Seed-planting, the first growth phase, involves the call, the commitment, and Christian communion. The basic knowledge of God and learning to communicate with Him are the foundations of a Christian woman's life.<br />Most women are in the season Mrs. Evans calls growth, which builds on the foundation already in place. Here we learn obedience, service, and preparation. Without thorough grounding here, we cannot move on to the season of harvest. It is the time of raising our children, serving God's kingdom through unnoticed tasks, and increasing our knowledge of God.<br />Our time investment pays heavenly dividends in the season of harvest. Contentment, purpose, and fulfillment are the major disciplines of this time. Here, God places mature women in roles where they disciple other women, actively portray Him to the world, and realize their God given potential.<br />Lois Evans fills each of chapter with relevant scripture and then peppers it with her own experiences.

During our wait it is not God's desire for us to suffer needlessly, but to draw closer to Him. Karon humoruously shares her personal experiences as she learns how to wait purposely. She lets the reader know it is not an easy task, but the benefits are enormous as we choose to let the Holy Spirit guide us to the next level of our Christian walk. <br />This is a small book, but it's packed with an abundance of wisdom! Guaranteed to bring a smile to your face and give you a new outlook the next time your patience is put to the test.<br />--- reviewed by Tyora Moody for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

And then I woke up and realized the concept. We think we have &quot;found&quot; God, when all along he has been relentlessly pursuing us--never giving up, never letting go. We cannot break from his tender, loving grasp unless we totally look the other way. <br />Cecil Murphey, who has ghost-written over 80 books, is now speaking to us without the blanket of another name. His writing style is very simple and straightforward and within the first few pages you realize that if you met him in person, that you could sit down and talk about his experiences and his own faith. <br />He relays in anecdotal format his own adventure as a missionary and also those of acquaintances who have known the patience of a God whose love that has no end. <br />This is a very easy and pleasant read with insights that come to you long after the last page has been turned.<br />--- reviewed by Robin Rider for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

The child's adoptive mother died recently of cancer, and her father, Wes Grayson, is struggling to make his construction company cover the costs of the medical bills. <br />Wes meets Laney as she surreptitiously takes pictures of his daughter playing at a playground. Suspicious and worried about a possible kidnapping, he calls the police and arrests Laney. From the beginning, Wes finds it difficult to trust the woman who may be trying to steal his child from him. They both realize that they're attracted to each other, but Wes can't trust Laney and she doesn't share his faith in Christ. <br />Their budding relationship is threatened by their pasts and their links to one little girl who carries the key that could bring them together or tear them apart.<br />In addition to confronting issues of adoption, Blackstock also suggests the consequences of relationships between Christians and non-Christians. The fact that this occurs at all suggests that Blackstock is not afraid of controversy. That a Christian man would knowingly enter into this type of relationship, no matter what the end results are, shows disobedience to God. <br />Throughout this book, the character of Laney is far more sympathetic than that of Wes. Wes, as a Christian man, shows far more weakness, sin, and stubbornness than Laney. He thinks through his decisions and makes purposeful choices about anger and distrust. Laney admits to confusion about religion, yet makes far fewer mistakes than Wes. She has one honorable goal, to love and care for her daughter. Unlike Wes, Laney's errors are accidental. Perhaps the non-Christian showing greater Christian attributes than the professed Christian is closer to reality than many would like to admit.<br />Nevertheless, many readers will find \\"Never Again Good-Bye\\" to be an enjoyable read with a light tone throughout. It is a fast-read with a clean storyline and happy ending that make it a great summertime read. <br />--- reviewed by Terri Pilcher for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

Reverend Witt gave a sermon on being \\"called\\" to do missionary work for the Lord. Emily felt God speaking to her telling her to step forward, and this is just what she did. Although only men could be actual preachers, women were being asked to help start new churches. She would be allowed to preach sermons and have her own congregation. The only thing standing in her way was her father. He was not so sure about his young daughter going out on her to start a church. After praying to God to open her father's heart, he finally relented on letting her go. <br />When Emily came to Wesson Creek, she was not welcomed with open arms. There were very few who actually wanted t o attend church. Therefore she decided to call on people in and out of town. She kept reminding herself that she could only open the door and God would do the rest. As time went on she found that although she was the one preaching, the people of Wesson Creek helped her come closer to God by building her own faith. Along with learning about faith, Emily also had to realize that finding love with a man would not be easy with her calling.<br />The Calling of Emily Evans is a wonderful read. This is a book that this reviewer feels every young Christian woman should read. Emily herself is a remarkable character. She always puts God first, and this is not easily done for any person especially a young woman on her own. She trusts that God will always provide for her no matter how low on food or how small her allowance is. Emily is what every Christian aspires to be. Janette Oke has written another magnificent story. <br />--- reviewed by JoAnn Miller for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

Isn't it exciting to \\"stumble\\" on to an excellent author that you've never read before? This was the case for me with the very prolific, best selling author, Gilbert Morris. <br />In his 2nd book of the LIONS OF JUDAH series, Mr. Morris brings to life the Old Testament characters of Sarah, Abraham and all the others they encounter on their journey of faith.<br />In NO WOMAN SO FAIR, the author beautifully adds \\"meat to the bones\\" of the scriptural account of Abraham and Sarah. Even though his characters are fictional, the journey they undertake and the relationship they develop with \\"God Most High\\" is very believable and exciting, never a contradiction of the scriptural account. <br />We see how God tests Abraham and Sarah to mature their faith in Him. He brings to light, with fuller understanding, the lesson of how we can suffer terrible consequences when we take things into our own hands; when we \\"help\\" God with our carnal actions...we produce Ishmaels! Sarah's motives, in offering her maidservant Hagar as a host for the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham for a son, were born out of unbelief. And the afermath has been monumental. I'm sure she could never have imagined the full scope of her decision to \\"get ahead of God\\"; the consequences are in today's headlines, thousands of years later. May we truly learn from this mistake; our limited, carnal foresight is no better than Sarah's was.<br />As much as I enjoyed this book, I can't help but comment on the fact that, although the title certainly implies that this story's main character is Sarah, it is really about Abraham. As important as Sarah's role was in Abraham's life, she is still a relatively small aspect of the overall theme. I don't mean to criticize and I don't presume to possess the talent and writing skill that Gilbert Morris has in his little finger, but, in my opinion, the title is a little misleading. I state this at the end of my post because it isn't really that important. The story is excellentand well worth reading. I certainly intend on reading more from this much loved storyteller and hope you will too.<br />--- reviewed by Ginny Sutton for Christian Bookshelf	2003-08-27

The author shares her own vulnerabilities with us, and does so touchingly and with humor. Then she points out the \\"little\\" sins that we probably very often over look, or hope aren't seen, again with compassion, humor and the Bible to help us deal with these issues. Vanity, shopping for that new skirt just to look better then someone else; broken promises, or failing to followup on what we said we would do; boredom, just \\"having\\" to fill in silences with \\"news\\" of a friend, etc. This book will make a marvelous Bible study and/or women's discussion topic. Of course, men have the same sins as we do, but this book is directed more towards women's stumbling blocks like \\"competitive shopping\\". I highly recommend this book. But don't make the mistake I made and think that just because it is small that it will be a quick read, it is loaded with things to make you stop and think. I spent a lot of time putting this book down to pray for forgiveness over things I had overlooked as sins, and spent much time in contemplation of myself and my actions before I picked the book back up to digest another chapter. I want to share this book with a lot of friends and family, but I will be giving them their own copies.

She talks to him about her new house, new school, new church group and how frightened she is with all these changes. We read her thoughts as she handles her feelings that a new teacher doesn't care, and that her parents' rules are too crazy. We watch as she shares with God her fear about her parents' pending divorce. We see her mature in her strength in God as she goes through this school year.

Well, it isn't exactly a new church or community, the brothers grew up there, it is just a very different perspective now that the writer is the pastor of his old church. Many situations are shared, and dealt with, and this unique format had me feeling like I was right in Little River with everyone in the story. It isn't just a &quot;feel-good&quot; story, however, there is some suspense in the story as well. I truly enjoyed this book, and I think I would like to see the author deal with the situation the missionary brother is in, as well.

Better still, it's Christian Science Fiction. That combination is very hard to find but author Shane Johnson does a wonderful job. As a space flight historian and consultant to the HBO miniseries  FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON, Johnson writes a very credible fictional version of NASA's last flight of the Apollo Moon Mission. Sometimes the NASA technical jargon is tedious but the glossary is very helpful.<br />I have to admit that I had a bit of a problem with another of Johnson's SFs, THE LAST GUARDIAN. His portrayal of the symbolic \\"Christ\\" (savior) character made me somewhat uneasy. This being the case, I was concerned that ICE was going to follow suit with an equally odd twist when, in the story, an amazing discovery was made at the moon's south pole. The more I read, the more concerned I became about how he was going to resolve the tale yet it was very exciting and kept me racing to the next page. He kept me just a little off balance because I couldn't foresee where he was going (which, in my opinion, makes<BR>the reading all the more enjoyable). At one point, nearing the end, I thought I saw a similarity to a scriptural event but never dreamed that I was, after all, correct, until it was wrapped up in the last chapter. I was overwhelmingly pleased at his surprising perspective of a very familiar Bible story we all learned in Sunday School. His proposition was very believable and very satisfying. <br />I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading it again. It is the best piece of Christian Science Fiction I have read; one I'm glad to have in my library.

Ms. Flinchbaugh quite successfully enlightens the reader to the present, ongoing persecution of the Church in China and its resulting growth. <br />Even though her novel is a little weak in character development and much of the dialogue seems a bit contrived, it is rich in truth.

She brings to light the horrid discrimination against women in China and the callous and cruel treatment of orphaned children.<br />The main character, 19-year-old Kwan Mei Lin, shows us how God uses \\"all things together for good\\" no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in, if we stand firm in our faith.

Andrew Murray puts forth a scripturally based opinion on this topic in his book Divine Healing.<br />As a health practitioner, I was very disappointed to find that Mr. Murray believes in faith healing. According to Mr. Murray, \\"Already the health of our bodies is a fruit of the salvation Jesus has acquired for us. We see also that health as well as salvation is obtained by faith.\\" We are healed in proportion to the amount of faith in our lives, not works. He stated that health practitioners and medications should not be used because they steal from God the opportunity to heal us and show His power. His position seems reminiscent of Christian Science, which forbids vaccinations, medications, and visits to hospitals.<br />His strong support of faith healing may be due to the state of the church at the time in which he lived. The charismatic movement did not begin until the early nineteenth century, and very few miraculous healings or other signs of the Holy Spirit were seen during Mr. Murray's generation. Many people believed God had the power to do miracles, but they did not have the faith that God wanted to use his power in their lives. Thus teaching faith and healing would be very important to Mr. Murray.<br />This book does contain small jewels about healing. For example, he states, \\"One of the chief benefits, then, of divine healing will be to teach us that our body ought to be set free from the yoke of our own will to become the Lord's property. God does not grant healing until He has attained the end for which He permitted the sickness.\\" Until God's purpose for allowing an illness is completed, even the prayer of faith will remain unanswered.<br />This book is an excellent treatise on faith healing, and even those who don't agree with Andrew Murray's position may find nuggets of spiritual truth in Divine Healing.<br />--- reviewed by Terri for Christian Bookshelf's position may find nuggets of spiritual truth in Divine Healing. <br />--- reviewed by Terri for Christian Bookshelf	2002-06-28

The ugliness and ungodly strength of prejudice is clearly exposed and the one exposing it is a victim of prejudice herself, Kathleen &quot;Kit&quot; Shannon, one of the first women to step into the male arena of the Criminal Justice system. Kit is a lawyer, fulfilling what she believes to be her God-given mission in life; upholding righteousness and defending the innocent, without concern for obtaining wealth and fame. When a Mexican <BR>gardener,the brother of her dear friend Corazon, is falsely accused of a heinous crime, Kit, against all odds, gives her all to defend him. <br />She is shunned by the aristocracy of the city because she refuses to bow to the demands of the socially elite and detach herself from the lower class citizens she defends. She is given no cooperation or protection by the police because she is resented for her forceful cross-examination during sessions in court and for questioning their methods of interrogation. Kit is hounded by her Aunt Freddie and her fiance', Dr. Jeffrey Kenton, to leave this brutal, un-ladylike path and step back into her &quot;proper&quot; role of a woman of sophisticated breeding.<br />Unlike many Christian Romance novels that paint unrealistic views of life that always end with  &quot;...and they lived happily ever after&quot;, this book makes you hope for a happy ending but you are left wondering. Peterson's attempt to insure that you will read the next book in the series is to be commended. <br />--- reviewed by Gin for Christian Bookshelf	2002-02-27

Searching for God's plan for your life is an integral part of maturing now as it was for the teens in Lauraine Snelling's A Dream to Follow. Norwegian immigrant, Thorliff Bjorklund yearns for college and a writing career, yet his father sees a more practical future for his son. His father's dream is for Thorliff to take over the family farm.<br />Elizabeth Rogers has always wanted to be a doctor. But before the turn of the 20th century, woman doctors were not accepted. Elizabeth is determined and knows this is the path she is to take, but why so many obstacles?<br />Snelling alternates between the comfortable rural family life of Thor and Elizabeth's more sophisticated upper class atmosphere with ease. We are given many insights into Minnesota farm living and rural life as well as the life of a family in a more urban setting in the late 1800's.  Snelling's writing is very simplistic and although she may not have intentionally aimed it at young adults, it would certainly appeal to teens who are searching for God's plan for their life.<br />This book displays how God's will for our lives may not be as clear cut as we would hope and that we must continually seek him and have faith in His plan.<br />--- reviewed by Robin for Christian Bookshelf	2002-02-20

As Steve Benson, investigates the death of his brother, Cliff, certain things don't add up about the presumed bear attack. The longer Steve stays, the more agitated the Hyde River town folk become with his questions. The town folks are obviously scared and have chosen to ignore the \\"evil\\" that has clung to the town since it's establishment. This \\"evil\\" is slowly revealed in an incredibly scary fashion! <br />For those who have ever read the book of Revelation, Peretti brings one of the symbolic images to physical life. Peretti's description of the creature is top notch writing. Further use of graphical imagery brings home the message of how deep evil can penetrate one's heart. This novel will give you a lot to think about theogically as well as give you goose bumps. It's definitely not your ordinary Christian novel, but the themes of God's saving grace and evil's powerful attraction will not be missed either.<br />--- reviewed by Ty ...	2002-02-15

Do you plan your vacation just so things go smoothly? Have you ever thought of applying this type of planning to your everyday life? Better yet, how about applying God's plan to your life?<br />The author leads you through developing a life plan step-by-step and through prayer. Hopefully, using prayers and analysis you can discover within yourself what God has mapped out for you, and perhaps get your life just a little more organized. There are sections for you to think on where your foundation lies, your purpose (don't we all wonder that from time-to-time), your mission, ministry, etc. She poses questions for you to ponder as you work through each section, and then suggests you note your responses in a journal (There is one available for this book, or you can use your own notebook). <br />Don't believe for a second that this is a dry, analytical type of book. This author weaves her very own personality, life and humor into this book for discovering a life plan, and of course there are plenty of Biblical references to guide you to developing your plan. There are even appendices and examples to assist you. Perhaps you are a person who works better in a group or with a partner to help keep yourselves on track. If that is the case, there is even a group Bible study format in the back.  <br />This wonderful little book is going to find itself read until its covers fall off here at my house.

In the midst of this happiness though, lingers the sorrow and shame of her shunning from the Old Order Amish of Hickory Hollow where she and Dan grew up. They have found salvation in Jesus Christ and are active and content in their new Mennonite church. However, the couple is forbidden to visit with family and friends due to the \\"Bann\\"- excommunication-imposed on them for going \\"fancy\\". Katie's biggest regret is the loss of her relationship with her \\"Dat\\"-her father. Can she ever repair the damage done to her family?<br />In part two entitled Bird-In-Hand, ex-journalist, Philip Bradley, must learn the ways of his new faith, with the help of his wife Rachel and the community.

Each story holds you to the end and all end happily yet realistically. They give the reader an insight into afascinating and often misunderstood way of life, It is fast paced and filled with optimism and good Christian wisdom. The characters are well developed and there is a sense of being right there with them in peaceful Lancaster County, riding horse and buggy amidst the changing autumn colors.

This book would be good for anyone wanting a little insight into what happened to orphan children before our current welfare system existed.  <br />The book can be read as an adventure story about orphan children surviving the streets of New York.  It starts with a young orphan boy named Kip who runs with a group of boys who are simply trying to survive on the streets of New York with no adult assistance.  It tells how they trade coal and find other ways to get food in order to survive.  It even shows how easily they found themselves placed in jail or just disappearing off the streets to parts unknown.  The story shows you a few different views of how children suddenly found themselves orphaned in the big city.  You can't help but wonder what would have happened to children like this if the Children's Aid Society of New York hadn't been started by Rev. Charles Brace.<br />Then, the story takes you through the children overhearing the adults discussing how the children will only remain dependent on society unless they can be placed in family situations.  Then we learn about the orphan trains.  I only vaguely remember reading about the orphan trains in the past, but after reading this book, I would like to learn more.  This touching story takes you all the way from the streets of New York to the orphan children being placed with farm families in Michigan who love and care for them.  There is list at the end of the story for further reading on Rev. Charles Loring Brace and the orphan trains for people who want to learn more.

That life begins as a mother's ends in childbirth. Parker's pages turn quickly from the deathbed to full-blooded life. There's fast-paced action as mountain moonshiners face off with government revenuers, gambling exacts a heavy toll on an already impoverished family, and World War II patriotism pulls young men from the Carolina hills to the blood soaked battlefields of Europe. The romantic soul will wrench as hearts are broken and lifelong unions are made. The author relates the story in the third person, but often changes the character through whose eye's he views the events occurring. Parker proves equally adept at voicing the innermost thoughts of both his male and female characters.<br />Highland Hopes takes you through Abigail Porter's childhood years, years that she learns to love her Blue Springs Mountain home, and years that she learns to love her father, even though she feels distinctly unrequited in her affection. She dreams of learning to read, that she might know all about the big wide world of Asheville and beyond. Her young desires grow into a yearning to leave the mountain and better herself, but there is always a tangible pull toward the hills of her birth. The first twenty-nine years of Abby's life take the reader quickly and poignantly from the new dawn of the 20th century in the ageless Blue Ridge Mountains to a definable turning point at the age of twenty-nine, when she finally feels her father's love.<br />The pages of this copy of Highland Hopes are indelibly marked with coffee and tear stains -- a sure reminder of long late night reads and the powerful emotions that this tale evoked. I, for one, am eagerly anticipating the second book in the Blue Ridge Legacy, where Granny Abby will unfold more of her beautiful BlueRidge memories.<br />--- reviewed by Lori for Christian Bookshelf	2001-12-05
