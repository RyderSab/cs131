It's a shame that Amazon doesn't allow reviewers to give no stars, because this book doesn't even deserve ONE. <br /> <br />Like most of the reviewers here, I read \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" and enjoyed it (although sometimes wanting to wring Nanny's neck for being such a doormat to the evil Mrs. X) even with the less-than satisfying ending, and was hoping that \\"Citizen Girl\\" would be as enjoyable. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I couldn't have been more wrong. <br /> <br />Apparently, the authors' idea for their second book was to follow the same format as their first one - give the main characters 'generic' names (Girl, Guy, Buster, Manley), set most of the action in NYC, and have Girl/Nanny be taken advantage of during the entire course of the 'action'.   <br /> <br />Shabbily written and VERY difficult to follow, with no real plot to speak of, a lot of retro-feminism mixed with soft and hard-core porn.   <br /> <br />The only interesting part of the book was the opening chapter, then it was all downhill from there. <br /> <br />If you MUST read it, check it out from the library (even though it's a fairly new book, my library had plenty of copies available...THAT should have told me something - Nanny Diaries was on the hold waiting list for MONTHS).  But you still might get upset anyway, depending on how valuable your free time is.	2005-01-26

As a person who has lost 115 pounds and kept the weight off for fifteen years, I know how hard it is to find information on the very important topic of MAINTAINING weight loss.  Amongst the hundreds - possibly THOUSANDS - of weight-related books, the fad diets, the gimmicks, the celebrities and the profiteers is this GEM of a book.  This ain't no 'magic miracle diet' - Thin For Life is the REAL DEAL.  Any jaded dieter who has read the popular diet books trying to lose PERMANENTLY is sure to find this book a much-needed breath of POSITIVE fresh air!  As one of the moderators at 3FatChicks' forum (which features a long-established Maintainers Forum with great information) Ms. Fletcher's book is perhaps THE most consistently recommended.  (It's the BIBLE of the Maintainer's Forum!)  Definitely worth more than a read - this book's a KEEPER.  THANK YOU MS. FLETCHER!	2004-10-28

After reading some of the 'favorite book' lists here at Amazon, I decided to check this book out.  Once you get past the first third of the book, it just gets more and more depressing - and then at the end, all hope and joy is totally dissipated. <br /> <br />I was hoping for an uplifting story involving horses, instead (as has been stated by other reviewers here) everyone dies or is in comas, there is no light anywhere here. <br /> <br />Thankfully, I checked the book out from the library, so all I lost was the time I spent slogging through this book.	2004-07-27

The Arabian Horse &quot;industry&quot; of the 1980's is an interesting topic - ripe for a full-blown 'expose' similar to Auerbach's excellent book on the rise and fall of Calumet Farm &quot;A Wild Ride&quot;.  However, &quot;Trading Paper&quot; and the other two books by Cali Canberra don't fill the bill.  The writing style is atrocious - an English/journalism teacher could easily use these books as an example of &quot;Don't Let This Happen To You!&quot;  (and don't blame the publisher for not providing an editor - I believe these books were self-published by the author).  <br />The book is purported to be fiction based on fact, but what it turns out to be (easy enough to figure out for anyone who followed the Arabian Horse industry at the time) is a thinly veiled story based on 'gurus' and celebrities of the Arabian horse world at the time - she just changed their names ever so slightly.  <br />Like I said, interesting topic (which is why I'm giving it two stars) but due to the writing, a VERY painful book to read.  And &quot;Never Enough&quot; is worse still.	2004-05-11

Of course we all knew right from the get-go that Black Minx would win the Derby; the process was fascinating.  This story really centers more on Henry and Black Minx, more than Alec and the Black.  Henry's solutions for curing Black Minx of her bad habits and foibles were wonderful.<br />Oh and BTW, in response to an earlier reviewer's query:  in the first chapter of the first book it is plainly stated that the Black is \\"too big to be pure Arabian\\".  Additionally, in Book #2 (The Black Stallion Returns) Abu Ishak states that Shetan (the Black) is NOT a purebred Arabian.  However, even if the Black WAS a purebred Arab, the Jockey Club was still registering Arabians up though 1943 (the first book in the series was published in 1941).  One more thing - at least one offspring of the Black already WON the Kentucky Derby - Satan, in the book \\"The Black Stallion and Satan\\".  Just FYI.	2003-05-12

Don't know how many readers are aware of the fact that Pam in this book (and a short snippet in the following book) is based on Walter Farley's own daughter, Pam Farley, who loved horses...she passed away in a car accident at the age of 20 in 1968 in Europe.  Mr. Farley stated several times that this book \\"The Black Stallion & The Girl\\" was meant as a memorial of her free spirit and love of horses.<br />That being said, I do not think it is the best of the series.  For one thing, I think that Mr. Farley had lost his 'spark' some time before that - and the early death of his beloved daughter didn't help much.  The book has not aged well either - Pam comes across as a '60's hippie girl.  Henry becomes an intolerant old geezer, and Alec begins to question his parents' values (why he would do that when they have given him a free rein all this time...well...).<br />I do admit that it was nice to read about Alec falling in love but all those scenes seemed so contrived to me...<br />It's still better than the followup that was released 12 years later \\"The Black Stallion Legend\\" which is just DEPRESSING.	2003-05-07

Hm, shall we compare titles?<BR>\\"Fat Land : How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World\\"  versus \\"The Fat of the Land: The Obesity Epidemic and How Overweight Americans Can Help Themselves\\"<br />Of course the science in Crister's book is a bit more up to date than in Fumento's, but the message is the same...Americans eat too much sugar and fat, and calories in general.  The only thing is, back in 1997 when the Fumento book was released, people didn't want to hear that.  Now, in the aftermath of \\"Fast Food Nation\\" and the McDonald's lawsuit (more to come I'm sure), Crister (or his publishers) have decided the time is right for this book...<br />Not nearly as interesting a read as Fumento's, I was only able to read \\"Fat Land\\" once - I'd recommend this as a library checkout book only...now \\"Fat of the Land\\" by Michael Fumento - THAT's a keeper!<br />I must admit that way way back in the \\"notes\\" section, Crister does give an eensy weensy credit to the Fumento book...	2003-02-28

I had wanted to review this book before, but decided to wait until I completed my first 12 week challenge.  This book was really a life-changer for me.  After years of spending an average of 1 1/2 - 2 hours a day, six days a week, in the gym and seeing little or no results (performing an average of 70-80 minutes of cardio each time and some unfocused weight training) I was skeptical at first of Bill Phillips' claims that performing 20 minutes of cardio three times a week, plus three weight-training workouts of less than an hour each a week would give me any measurable results - but they have!  ....  <br />At this point, though, I must correct some errors made by earlier reviews - first off, Myoplex is only a convenience - not required.  There are other meal replacements out there that work - or you can choose not to use them at all.  And shop around for the best price ....  The only other supplement he recommends by name is Betagen, but you don't even HAVE to supplement at all - I would recommend multi-vitamins at the very least (generic versions from your local drugstore).  Brett Sharpe below states that Bill Phillips recommends four Myoplex shakes a day, when in fact he recommends that at least THREE of your SIX meals consist of 'whole foods'.  I myself use 2 Myoplex Lites a day on average.<br />If you can't afford boneless, skinless chicken breasts, you're looking in the wrong aisle of your supermarket.  Try the frozen-food section - most groceries now sell the big bags of IQF chicken breasts ....  And bread IS authorized (albeit reluctantly).  I myself do not eat bread unless it's my Free Day (a great part of the program by the way!).  And about eating before you exercise - if your goal is to burn bodyfat, you should exercise on an EMPTY stomach ...<br />All in all, a great program that I'd recommend to anyone!  Looking forward to my second challenge starting on Monday!	2001-07-20

So you can imagine my delight when I found that all those terrific strips were put in one magnificent collection!  <br />Every summer the bears and Mrs. Melmac take off for Yosemite - Mrs. Melmac in her RV, the bears whichever way they can (one year they hijacked a SF Muni bus) and the fun begins!

I have recommended this book (along with Michael Fumento's excellent &quot;The Fat of The Land&quot;) to so many people - mostly women who, much like myself, have dieted all their lives, spent unknown amounts of money trying to find that magic way to lose weight for good and all - only to wind up failing and blaming themselves, rather than the overly-restrictive programs that they just could not follow.<br />Laura Fraser does some hard-hitting research and goes undercover at Jenny Craig, franchised &quot;diet doctors&quot;, Overcoming Overeating, etc.  She interviewed survivors of weight-loss surgery, leading nutritionists, scientists, and medical experts and even Susan Powter &amp; Richard Simmons to get a perspective of  the multi-billion dollar diet industry - a giant pot that so many of us toss our money into, yet usually receive poor long-term results.<br />She wraps this research with her own experiences (which in many ways mirror my own childhood) as a chubby kid whose parents had her constantly on diets which were doomed to failure.<br />However - nowhere in the book does Ms. Fraser say that it is UNHEALTHY to lose weight - in fact, the paperback edition of the book is distinctly different from the first hardcover edition, giving tips on &quot;eating like an Italian&quot; (she makes a great many comparisions to the way Americans eat vs. the way her Italian friends eat - Michael Fumento's book also observes the differences in eating habits and size portions of the US vs. Europeans) and including exercise into your day.<br />From what I read, I gather that Ms. Fraser is around 5'6&quot;-5'8&quot; tall and weighs between 150-160 pounds - which, to me, doesn't sound especially overweight (I myself am 5'4&quot; tall, currently 152 and wear size 8 DKNY jeans) so I don't think I'd call her an advocate of fat acceptance.  <br />If anyone is considering spending money on a 'diet program' I'd highly recommend picking up a copy of both this and the Fumento book beforelaying down your hard-earned $$ at Jenny Craig, Herbalife, or even Weight Watchers.  Good Luck!	2001-05-20

But, I found that this was a total letdown.  The soul, richness and depth inherent in the other Mitford books is lacking in &quot;A Common Life&quot;.  Like many others, I preordered this book - not only for myself but for my mother and mother-in-law as well.  I took my copy along on a trip to the UK, hoping that it would last me the trip - only took a few hours to read.<br />Something else I missed - the wonderful illustrations that are so much a part of the earlier books.  The bouquets throughout the book are nicely done, but I would have liked to see Cynthia, Fr. Tim, Dooley, Barnabas, etc. decked out in their wedding finery!  <br />Of course, most Mitford fans will purchase this book regardless - but I suggest you wait and get it at a much lower price.  This book should have been list priced at less in my opinion.  What a let down!	2001-04-23

These books (this hardcover edition is actually the three original books in one!) were some of my favorites when I was a child.  I first encountered Pippi when my grandma took us girls to the movies to see the original film (starring Inger Nilsson - VERY hard to find!).  Despite the painfully bad special effects and overdubbing from Swedish to English, I was enchanted by the story...naturally had to run out to the library and check out all the books!  The &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; books transcend time - children today can still enjoy them.  Only the finest children's books (Walter Farley's, Laura Ingalls Wilder's and Margurite Henry's come immediately to mind) can continue to captivate today's jaded youngsters.<br />I was fortunate enough to come across a copy of &quot;The Adventures of Pippi Longstocking&quot; as a Christmas present for my 9 year old niece.  It's wonderful to see her enjoying Pippi's adventures with Tommy, Annika, Mr. Nilsson, and the rest of the characters as much as I did (more years ago than I wish to remember!)	2000-12-31

I don't know if I would actually try any of the recipes in this book (just not the kind of stuff I usually eat these days) but the chapters on food rationing and wartime entertaining (usually just glossed over in most books about the era) were very interesting!  I just gave this book three stars since I would have liked more historical photos, as well as pictures of some of the completed dishes.  If you enjoyed this book, I would also recommend the &quot;Culinary Arts Institute Encyclopedic Cookbook&quot; which was first published in the 40's, as another view of American cookery at that point in time.	2000-12-27

One of my earliest memories as a child is of Mom and Dad taking the whole darn family to the only McDonald's in our area at that time (mid-60's) in Belmont, California - it was still the old fashioned McD's with giant golden arches and outdoor seating (why they decided to tear all of those down, I have no idea - they were wonderful!).  A week after my 16th birthday, I started my first real (non-babysitting) job at the local McD's in Foster City.  Although I seldom dine there now (waiting for veggie burgers!), the impact and history of McDonald's has always fascinated me.  Before picking up &quot;Behind the Arches&quot; the only book I had read about the subject was &quot;Big Mac - the Unauthorized Story of McDonalds&quot; which in fact is not really the story of McDonalds at all, but rather one of franchising in general with a bit more of a focus on McDonalds.  <br />Mr. Love's book, however, focuses more on the genius of Ray Kroc and Fred Turner; how the corporation relies on its owner/operators and suppliers for new ideas (Filet-O-Fish, Big Mac, apple pies, McMuffin, etc.).  The chapters on the development of the perfect frozen french fry and Chicken McNuggets were especially interesting...as well as how McDonald's moved into Japan and Europe.  Even if you detest McDonald's food, read this book - HIGHLY recommended.	2000-12-26

I also enjoyed the sinister story twist involving the widow Edith as she attempts to seduce Tim (she pops up in the remaining books from time to time...like an evil spirit).

For me, it is much slower paced than many of the books I usually read.  It began so slowly, I put it aside for awhile, but after reading all the enthusiastic reviews, came back to it.  Mitford is truly one of the quiet towns that many of us dream about retiring in, where everyone knows everyone else.  As my parents both hail from that exact type of Southern town and are very active in their church and social lives even today, I can see why Mom enjoyed the books so much.  I'm looking forward to see what happens next in the lives of Father Tim, Dooley, Cynthia, and of course Barnabas!

Like thousands of other Americans, I was mesmerized by the sick drama of Mary Kay Letourneau as it unfolded in the media.  This book goes beyond the media hype and manages to stay neutral - almost impossible with a case this emotionally charged.  Upon reading this book, I was reminded of two other selfish women - Diane Downs (&quot;Small Sacrifices&quot; who killed one of her children and almost killed the other two in order to win the object of her obsession) and Pam Smart (who also had sex with one of her students, and was able to manipulate him into murdering her husband).  Even though Letourneau didn't kill anyone, in one fell swoop she managed to pretty much irrepairably harm the lives of her children, her students, and a host of friends and acquaintances.  All because she would not control her selfish, childish impulses...it will be interesting to see what happens when she is released from jail...I suspect that Letourneau, her two youngest children and Vili will kickstart the 'media circus' and sell their story to the highest bidder...time will tell.<br />Gregg Olsen's book may be the only neutral telling of this sad, pathetic tale.	2000-10-17

Mr. Farley REALLY did his research  on this -- the facts are 100% accurate as far as I can tell -- and as  always in his writings, his love of horses (as well as his awe at the  legend that Man O'War was) comes through.  He was able to create a  character - Danny, Man O'War's racing groom in this book, similar to Alec  Ramsey, Tom Messenger and Steve Duncan (the boys attached to their horses  in his &quot;Black Stallion&quot; series) whose devotion to Man O'War lasts  and shapes his entire life.

One of  the very few young adult novels I have found that writes about harness  racing in an exciting fashion.  Reading this book makes me long for the  'good old days' of country fairs where everyone knew everyone else.  Walter  Farley was gifted not only in bringing the excitement of horse racing and  his love of horses in general to life, but in this book the human  characters -- Jimmy, Tom, Uncle Wilmer and the others -- are drawn in such  a way where the reader can easily visualize them in his or her mind.  I  couldn't imagine any horse loving person NOT enjoying this book (as well as  the follow up &quot;The Black Stallion's Sulky Colt&quot; which I believe  is currently out of print, but worth looking for if not only to continue  Bonfire's story).	2000-08-17

I  believe that even if the reader of this book was only marginally interested  in Coke, he or she would be swept up in this well-researched and written  book. Mark Pendergrast is a terrific writer -- this book reads like a  compelling novel, and will be VERY difficult for the first-time reader to  put down!    I especially enjoyed the chapters on Coke's influence during  WWII, as well as the &quot;New Coke&quot; debacle of the 1980's (the  chapter is titled &quot;The Worst Marketing Blunder of the Century&quot;).   Not to mention that the world-famous &quot;secret formula&quot; is revealed  in this book as well!

In a  historical work like &quot;For God, Country, and Coca-Cola&quot; a  photographic reference is absolutely necessary!  Still a great read,  though!P.S.  I'm ordering a copy for my dad (who was a collegue of Coke  president &amp; CEO Roberto Goizueta in the 50's and 60's) - I know he'll  get a kick out of it!	2000-08-01

Since hubby and I are both avid cyclists and also work at a bike shop (myself part time, him full time) this book interested me.  It is at once a history of the bicycle in general, and about Schwinn in particular.  Ms.  Crown and Mr. Coleman relate in vivid detail the creation of the Schwinn  bike by Ignaz Schwinn, and how subsequent generations of the family (who  owned the company up until the 1990's) developed new products, but later  let opportunities (such as the development of the BMX and mountain bike  -which was created with old Schwinn parts) slip through their fingers.  By  the 70's the controlling family members appeared to have little or no  interest in bicycles -- only in their annual incomes from their family  trust -- and failed to realize that they were letting down the family name  and reputation for quality.The book also touches on other bike  manufacturers, such as Specialized, Gary Fisher and Trek, and how these  companies profited by Schwinn's 'falling asleep at the wheel' old boys'  club-type school of thought.  Apparently, Schwinn never realized until it  was far too late that there was/is a vast adult market out there!  This  book is compelling reading for anyone interested in bicycle history, or  just American business in general.  Highly recommended if you can find it!	2000-07-12

I had previously reviewed the hardcover edition of this book on Amazon and given it a good review - three or four stars, I think.  I have now downgraded it to two stars...After over six months, I picked up the book to  re-read it.  I was amazed at the nuances I failed to pick up in my previous  reading of this book!  While I do admire anybody's effort to lose weight  and realize from agonizing personal experience how difficult it can be,  still there are so many times she contradicts herself, many of which are  listed in previous reviews. Like that episode in the department store with  the lingerie display.  The other reivewers were right -- I mean how else  are you expected to sell underwear?  Another thing is how she swings so  widely about her husband. First, he doesn't support her -- not being there  at night after working at what sounds like a high stress job, supporting a  very large family, BTW -- to discuss her diet with her...yet she explodes  when he drives her to an Overeaters Anoymous meeting in a sincere attempt  to help her.  The way she takes things out on her children is also  disturbing.  Jeez, I thought MY house was messy -- she is at home most of  the day, yet from the photo taken of her in February 1996, both her and her  house look like disaster areas!  Obviously, Rosemary needed (and maybe  still needs?) professional psychiatric help -- but she feels that losing  weight is the answer to all her problems.  Well guess what?  While I can  personally say that being 120 pounds lighter than I was 10 years ago  definitely makes life better, it is by no way the answer to all life's  problems!Also, I wrote to Rosemary a couple of times, first c/o Warner  Books, and then using the &quot;Winning at Thinning&quot; address, and  never received a reply.  Like another reviewer below, I have the feeling  that Rosemary Green was unable to maintain the lifestyle changes necessary  to keep the weight off, and is obese again...otherwise, she would still be  SOMEWHERE in the spotlight, even if she hadn't come out with that sequel  she promised so confidently!  Perhaps if I'd included a request for info to  order her &quot;Winning at Thinning&quot; plan (what sounds like a dubious  plan at best, even though she did have some good tips on pages 334-336 of  the paperback edition) I may have received a reply?	2000-07-07

When I have a long vacation, this is usually one  of the books I take with me...I only gave it four stars because some of the  sections (mostly the Ad Hoc Committee free zone meeting sequences) tend to  go on and on...but still an excellent book all the same.

This is really not much like that awful film that came out in the 70's...although I think that Gene Wilder was a good choice to play Willy Wonka.  I first read this book in second grade, saw the film a year or so later -- what a disappointment.  The book is WONDERFUL!  Roald Dahl has a  very droll way of writing that is all at once heart-touching, charming, and  kind of grotesque -- just the thing that kids love to read!  I especially  enjoy the songs (in the book, not the movie!) that the Oompa-Loompas would  sing:  &quot;Augustus Gloop!

A terrific story -- if you're a horse lover, you will really enjoy this book.  Janet Dailey really did her research on the Arabian horse  business of that time (the boom of the early and mid 80's) and only made a  couple of errors, which only Arabian horse insiders would figure out  anyway.  In addition, the characters are believable and sympathetic.  All  in all, a fulfilling read -- good for those summer vacation days!	2000-06-08

OK, so some of the historical details aren't entirely accurate -- this is a terrific book.  I first came across it at the age of 16, when one of my bunkmates at summer camp loaned me her copy.  I was riveted -- and purchased my own copy right after camp!  18 years later, I was going  through a box of old books and re-discovered this book.  It's even better  reading now than it was then!  The characters are well drawn -- not only  the main couple, Wulfgar and Aislinn, but the supporting characters as  well.  Adventure, love and happy endings for the good people, and the bad  people get what they deserve!   I would particularly recommend this book if  you're in need of a good read whilst lying on the beach this summer, or on  a long boring airplane flight - the time will speed by and you are  guaranteed to be swept up in this tale!

The subtitle of this book is &quot;Gearing Up A Level&quot; and that's just what following the recommendations in this book will do!  This is an essential volume for any woman cycling enthusiast (including Spinning/indoor cycling nuts) who is ready to do a century ride, AIDS ride,  race or something similar but who isn't sure where to start -- and can't  afford to hire a coach!  The only disagreement I have with the author is  some of the nutrition recommendations (being a vegetarian myself -- she  recommends more of a &quot;Zone&quot; approach).  But this does not detract  from the overall excellence of the book, especially the bike fit chapter --  as someone who works part-time in a bike shop, I have helped other 'gals'  who have run the gamut at other shops and been totally frustrated trying to  get a good fit!  My recommendation is - if you're 'gearing up a level' and  planning on buying a new bike - buy this book first, read the bike fit  chapter (or better yet, bring the book with you when you're trying out  bikes) and THEN buy your dream bike!	2000-04-25

Robert Lawson's love of animals and the outdoors is evident in not only his story, but in his illustrations.  The  characters truly &quot;come to life&quot;.  In all of Mr. Lawson's books,  he was able to bring life and color to the animals who are frequently the  focus and narrators of his tales.  If you enjoyed this book, its sequel  &quot;The Tough Winter&quot; is also worth a look as well.  I can't wait to  read &quot;Rabbit Hill&quot; to my nephew - I know he'll love it!

Walter Farley started writing the story which became &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; while he was still in high school.  I think I was eight or nine years old when I first read it.  I still read the series from time to time, and time has only made me appreciate Farley's fine writing skills all  the more.  Especially the final chapter about the match race between Sun  Raider, Cyclone, and the Black - I can actually HEAR the track announcer's  &quot;It's the mystery horse!&quot; in my mind.  Mr. Farley had the unique  ability to express emotions through the written word - it still gives me  tingles.<br />Only one beef I have - why, oh why, did they decide to re-do the  illustrations?  I still have my dogeared Scholastic Books paperback with  the original illustrations.  The original illustrator made the Black truly  look like &quot;the wildest of all wild creatures&quot;.<br />This book should  be in every child's library!	2000-01-20

I thought I would give this book a 'second chance' so I am slogging through it again.  I won't deny that Rose Wilder Lane was a complex person, BUT I really don't think that Laura Ingalls Wilder was as much an untalented ogre as this book would have us believe.  I do believe that Rose  was a terrific EDITOR, but I don't believe that she 'wrote' Laura's books,  or that Laura couldn't write.  There is plenty of evidence out there that  Laura was a very adept writer.  For instance, her columns and articles for  the Missouri Ruralist (Rose was off in Albania at the time Laura wrote most  of these, so how could she have had a hand in them? ); Laura's beautifully  descriptive letters to Almanzo in &quot;West from Home&quot; (WHY would  Rose have to write Laura's personal letters for her?).  Further, as a  reviewer below stated, Rose's own published works, aside from her short  stories, leave much to be desired.  <br />As far as her personal life, Rose  seems to have been a very depressed person who was seldom happy in her life,  and blamed it on her mother.  A better book, I think, is &quot;Becoming Laura  Ingalls Wilder&quot; by John Miller - better written and far more enlighting,  in my opinion!	2000-01-18

The first &quot;Little House&quot; book came out in 1932, and the books in Laura Ingalls Wilder's series dealing with her South Dakota years,  beginning with &quot;By the Shores of Silver Lake&quot; were first  published in 1937.  So it is more likely that Rose, while editing her  mother's books for publication, used (I hate to use the term  &quot;plagarized&quot; but it almost fits) her mother's children's books as  ideas for her own (she also did this with &quot;Let the Hurricane  Roar&quot;).  Both &quot;Free Land&quot; and &quot;Hurricane&quot;  (reissued in the 70's as &quot;Young Pioneers&quot;) are probably only of  interest to those interested in Rose Wilder Lane, whom I believe was better  at editing other people's material and writing short stories than actually  writing entire books on her own.	2000-01-18

Roger McBride's forward in this book states that he supposed that Laura wrote this as an outline for later embellishment, editing, and publication but the death of her husband took away her enthusiasm for this.  This theory is questionable, as there is evidence that Laura wrote this journal  sometime in the early 30's (called by her &quot;The First Three Years and A  Year of Grace&quot;).  She also stated in a speech in 1937 that the Little  House series was to end (&quot;as all good novels should&quot;) with Laura  and Almanzo's courtship and marriage and was going to be a total of eight  books.  There are numerous published statements by Laura that &quot;Those  Happy Golden Years&quot; was to be her last book, those statements being  made years before Almanzo's death.<br />That said, this book, while lacking  the polish of the original series, is an interesting historical document  and should be of interest to readers who want to know &quot;what happened  next?&quot;  However, its rightful place is in the same category as  &quot;West from Home&quot; or &quot;On The Way Home&quot;, NOT as one of  the Little House books.	2000-01-07

A very hard book to read, except for noting how the ghostwriter bases the plots on Ms. Andrews' original writings (the Dollanganger series, My Sweet Audrina, and most of  the Casteel series, I believe, were the only books actually WRITTEN by  her).  If you read the later books carefully, you can even find whole  paragraphs lifted verbatim from the original books.  In just about every  other instance, this would be considered plagarism but since (I assume) the  Andrews estate and the publisher are raking in the bucks, nothing is done  about this.  The ORIGINAL, GENUINE Andrews books are very good in their  genre, but I wouldn't bother with the rest of them, beginning with the Dawn  series...yawn...one has to think what Ms. Andrews herself would think of  this...imitation is the sincerest form of flattery? or just plain upset  that her reputation is being dragged through the mud with these trashy,  worthless books?<br />The worst thing is, I have a feeling that most of the  readers of these books are teenage or young adults.

I first read this book when I was eight years old, and I loved it so much I went to the library and checked out the sequels.  As other readers mentioned, not only are these books interesting and fun to read (I still  enjoy reading them at age 37) but Christians can get a glimpse of what the  Jewish religion is really like on a day-by-day basis.  Other than Hanukah  and Passover, school kids aren't really taught much about the other Jewish  holidays.  I remember in fourth grade, a Jewish girl in my class brought in  Hamentaschen pastries, and I normally wouldn't have tried something with  prunes in it - but because I had read about Purim in &quot;All of a Kind  Family&quot;, I discovered a wonderful treat!<br />I should also say that the  illustrations in the books are terrific!

Even  though they were not written for publication, her descriptions of the  events of the Pan-Pacific Expo, as well as San Francisco itself, are vivid,  captivating, and colorful.

If you can find the paperback edition of this book, I recommend that you read that edition rather than the 1995 hardcover, since it tells how Rosemary ultimately got down to 135 pounds, and NO, she did NOT get her  jaws wired shut!  While it is true that, while struggling to lose her  weight, she used some unhealthy methods (less than 800 calories a day and  eating a cup of Froot Loops for breakfast are the ones that stand out), I  don't see this as a diet book per se but a personal record of a woman who  struggled with weight and, let's face it, her addiction to chocolate,  sugary sweets, and fast food.  If you read the book carefully, you will  find that she REALLY begins to lose weight once she swears off chocolate  and sweets forever.<br />Personally, the first time I read this book, it was  difficult - but facinating - to read.  Now, I find it inspiring.  (Point of  reference - I weighed 265 in 1990 and am currently at 148, so I know  whereof Rosemary speaks).  I did send a letter to her earlier this year at  the address for Winning at Thinning, but have yet to receive a reply - I  also tried finding any refernece to her on the Net without success.  I hope  she has been able to maintain her weight loss.  Rosie, if you're reading  this, please let us know!  Thanks.	1999-12-04

This (and Happy Golden Years) is my favorite book of the Little House series.  The Ingalls family is doing well; the town has recovered from the Hard Winter; and Laura is changing from a girl into a woman.  The  descriptions of the characters and the surroundings are vivid and real.  I  don't care if Rose Wilder Lane wrote most of the books or not - the Little  House series is a gift to all readers, not just young readers!  I'm in my  30's and I still love to read them periodically, but this is one of my very  favorites.	1999-11-30

The reviewer of 10/18/99 either doesn't know what he's talking about or he's deliberately trashing Dr. McDougall's book.  If eating a vegan diet based around starches, fruits and veggies with very little protein is so  unhealthy, why is it that the rural Asian and African people, who live  mainly on starches and veggies, with very little or no meat, have far fewer  instances of cancers, osteoporosis, diabetes, etc. than the primarily  meat-eating countries do?  My father is a perfect example.  He was raised  on meats and fried foods and had borderline diabetes, high blood pressure,  and ultimately ended up having a triple bypass operation, due to his high  fat and cholesterol diet.  Following a vegan diet is one of the main  reasons (along with exercise) that I have been able to maintain an 80-lb.  weight loss for almost 10 years now.  Please, read this book!	1999-10-22

I have read all of Ms. Krantz' books except for Spring Collection, which for some reason I could not 'get into'.  I'll Take Manhattan is one of my faves of hers.  I highly recommend it -- I also recommend viewing the  miniseries (they show it on the Romance Network quite frequently)...very  well done and, for the most part, true to the book.	1999-10-18
US	51078729	R1NZDSFCUQZQFF	0786882980	645423213	Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and a Better Life	Books	5	50	50	N	N	Too bad Oprah isn't still making her connection	This is still one of my favorite exercise/diet books, and one of the few I actually own.  After hearing about how Oprah is now on a &quot;Carbo-addict&quot; kick, it's really sad to see her grasping at  trying to find a magic weightloss formula, just like she did in the 80's  with Optifast, when she already knows what she needs to do.  Don't let  Oprah's recent apparent weight gain stop you from reading this book.   Everything is laid out and simple to follow (yes, you DO have to make time  to exercise but I found if I want something badly enough I will do whatever  it takes).  Take it from me - I am currently 149 lbs and 10 years ago I  weighed 265 - the ONLY way to lose weight and keep it off is diet and  exercise.  If you are only going to get one 'diet' book, this is it.	1999-10-07

I have read this book dozens of times and have recommended it to many people...the health of Americans today is a paradox, everyone is worried about deficency diseases (protein deficiency, not enough vitamins, etc).   but the real problems are diseases of excess...when I went to Disneyland  recently I was reminded of Michael Fumento's book because there were a heck  of a lot of overweight people walking around eating...I have lost over 100  lbs and kept it off for 10 years basically eating right and exercising,  none of that fad diet stuff for me.  I must also mention that this book is  a GOOD READ and you may even chuckle in places.  It burns me up to see the  writers of fad diet books, pushers of diet pills, etc. making so much money  off vunerable fat people looking for a magical cure when the simple truth  is the only thing that works...eat fewer calories than you expend!  Michael  Fumento is right on the money!	1999-08-28

I'm only giving it four stars 'cos it hasn't been updated yet, so it's missing a few seasons.  Matt Groening, time to put out another edition!  My copy is dog-eared, next to the TV set.  Ay Caramba!	1999-08-27
