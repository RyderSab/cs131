This 85-page book, now twelve years old, is still unmatched in its brevity (contrast with Solomon's &quot;Noonday Demon,&quot; at over 400 pages), its bravery, and its straightforwardness (contrast with Moody's &quot;The Dark Veil&quot;).  It takes less than an hour to read.  If you have depression, or would like to know more about how it affects those who have it, start with this book.  I had seen Mr. Styron speak about this illness at a recent DRADA conference at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and he is very articulate about his experiences.  Highly recommended, especially for fellow sufferers.	2002-11-14

Life can seem so gosh-darn unfair during these years for our generation, and any self-help we can find is welcomed. Unfortunately, this book by Robbins and Wilner offers very little illumination on just what to do about it.<br /> I first noticed the co-author, the popular journalist Alexandra Robbins, on a BookTV program for her most recent book, \\"Secrets of the Tomb\\"--for which I would love to write a (not-so-glowing) review, but I am afraid to entangle myself with powerful secret societies and their influence. During the program, incidentally, I was struck by her good looks as much as I was surprised by her two blurts of profanity (on C-SPAN?). Being so turned-off, as it was, I chose to review her earlier book instead.<br /> In short, this book is a collage of interviews geared to reassure the confused college grad (which, by the way, does not reflect all people in their 20s) that s/he is not alone is his or her concerns about career, romance, finance, and general direction in life. It gives very little insight into what one can actually DO to resolve such personal crises, but it makes it clear that such fears are not uncommon among Generations X and Y. I took particular issue with the authors' contention that graduate school is more of a postponement of real life than it is a useful educational experience, as I am currently a grad student myself (by choice, not by market coercion).<br /> However, it remains important for troubled \\"twentysomethings\\" (a Gen X/Y shibboleth that takes some getting used to) to know that they are not alone in their fears, their (perceived) failures, and their discontents, so I do recommend this book for those who really need assurance of their group identity. Many of my peers fret over their current situation, and there is no need to pop Prozac if you are not truly depressed in a clinical sense. Few things are more pathetic than some sheltered grad, fresh out of Emory, Washington, Tufts, Virginia, or wherever, whining about the hardships of \\"the real world.\\" So you may rest assured that there are many others out there like you by browsing through this book. But for real advice on how to resolve life's dissatisfactions, I'd turn to the classics, such as Marcus Aurelius's \\"Meditations,\\" Robert Burton's \\"The Anatomy of Melancholy,\\" and Montaigne's \\"Essays.\\" They help out during crises at any stage of life, as they have for hundreds of years.s are more pathetic than some sheltered grad, fresh out of Emory, Washington, Tufts, Virginia, or wherever, whining about the hardships of \\"the real world.\\" So you may rest assured that there are many others out there like you by browsing through this book.

Well, to quote Robin Williams' character in \\"Good Will Hunting,\\" it's not your fault.<br />  Myers' book is a well-balanced and concise work, less than 150 pages (including endnotes and bibliography), but it packs a powerful impact. He focuses his well-documented attack on pretentious modern literature with specific stylistic criticism of five contemporary American authors, award-winning writers snugly ensconced in today's literary Hall of Fame. The excerpts he employs to demonstrate bad writing are as illustrative as they are painful to read, and there is scarcely a sensible reader out there who wouldn't agree with Myers' complaints. In many places, Myers contends that the amateur book reviewer on Amazon.com (that's us) knows more about good reading than the high-minded critic in New York. He ends the book with a fair response to his many critics and enemies, along with a sarcastic set of \\"rules\\" any aspiring writer of \\"serious\\" fiction ought to adhere to.<br /> In short, I am glad to have discovered this book, as it affirms many of my reactions to today's awful, yet acclaimed, writing. If you've ever been puzzled by the positive hype surrounding a terrible book, read this manifesto and discover that you are not alone.	2002-10-24

He is, without a doubt, one of the most notable scholarly writers of our time. It is too bad, then, that this initially appealing book, \\"Public Intellectuals,\\" falls short of what I expected.<br /> I first learned of this book during an interview with the author on C-SPAN's \\"Booknotes\\" with Brian Lamb. As the dust jacket correctly boasts, this volume \\"is the first systematic analysis of the contemporary American public intellectual.\\" In Part One of the book, Posner's critical chronicle of how today's public intellectual is most often out of his/her league is right on the money. Modern public intellectuals are almost exclusively academics, members of an ever more specialized university culture. Because of this solid trend, the typical public intellectual has very little \\"expert\\" knowledge outside of his/her esoteric area of study, lending him/her little if any credentials to comment on the general subject(s) he/she so \\"authoritatively\\" tackles in the public media. Posner's arsenal of examples, evidence, names, citations, and footnotes (he is a legal writer, of course) makes his case clear and well-defended.<br /> However agreeable his basic thesis is, though, it is his market approach to characterizing the problem that seems rather incongruent and almost far-fetched. In his effort to quantify the problem of the worsening American public intellectual, Posner draws heavily on economic principles to explain why public intellectuals today are no good--in terms of \\"market failure.\\" He demonstrates this model in Chapter Five with a veritable data section, full of charts and graphs. Though there is no better way to fortify one's thesis than with scientific evidence, the model Posner chooses just doesn't seem convincing. Public intellectuals do not really participate in a consumer culture, if you think about it. So long as there is (and always has been) public media outlets, intellectuals (genuine and self-proclaimed) will write, comment, prognosticate, and critique.<br /> Part Two of the book consists of five \\"genre studies\\" of areas where modern public intellectuals most often tread. Here, Posner takes a detailed look at key intellectual players and painstakingly criticizes and discredits each of them with what can only be described as an off-putting and perfectionist air--except for MIT's Noam Chomsky, who deserves it. From George Orwell to Chicago's Martha Nussbaum, Allan Bloom (whom he \\"outs\\") to NYU's Ronald Dworkin (his personal sparring partner), Richard Rorty to Gertrude Himmelfarb, Posner deals each writer a summary list of their shortcomings--and then thanks many of them in the Acknowledgments! Within these 150 pages, the reader is left with little to suggest that any of the prominent public intellectuals of our time retain even one shred of competence.<br /> The Conclusion, the most potentially redemptive (but shortest) section of the book, mollifies some of the blows inflicted by Posner in Part Two. However, the remedies suggested by Posner on how to improve today's public intellectual \\"market\\" are so soft, implausible, and ineffective even if implemented, that he might as well just say that restoring integrity to the public intellectual is a hopeless endeavor. The reader can only conclude that Posner's book, enlightening though it is in recognizing and attempting to explain the problem of the declining quality of public intellectuals, falls short of fulfilling its promises in the end.been) public media outlets, intellectuals (genuine and self-proclaimed) will write, comment, prognosticate, and critique.<br /> Part Two of the book consists of five \\"genre studies\\" of areas where modern public intellectuals most often tread.

King's book, brief though it is, tells the fascinating story behind the conception, construction, and completion of this magnificent example (perhaps the greatest) of Low Renaissance architecture.  This enduring dome set the standard for such later projects as St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, St. Paul's cathedral in London, and even the U. S. Capitol Building (designed by Benjamin Latrobe, notable also for his Romanesque-inspired Basilica in Baltimore).  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in exploring this hallmark edifice of the Renaissance.	2002-10-10

Hans Holbein's macabre and morbid series, \\"The Dance of Death,\\" gives us a chilling view into Europe during the time when its denizens, well, weren't really expected to make it too far into life.<br />  This Dover edition, though not as thorough as the complete 1538 French series (now out of print), provides a faithful reproduction of Holbein's masterpiece, with the original textual accompaniment in Latin (with English).  In these marvelous woodcuts, the viewer can easily sense the feeling of dread within the European community during a time that death came all too easily.<br />  Of course, death is a theme from which we can never truly escape, so I suppose Holbein's art speaks to all the ages.  Until we ourselves come to meet the Eternal Footman, we have Holbein's \\"Dance of Death\\" to give us a glimpse into what we may expect.	2002-10-07

Though I was unfortunately not able to see it in person at MOMA, nor have I yet to pay my respects at Ground Zero even, this companion book is as close as one can get to the real exhibit.<br />  &quot;A Democracy of Photographs&quot; is the perfect subtitle for describing the even-handed and straightforward ethos of this masterful collection.  The photographs contained herein do not sensationalize, do not manufacture, or do not distort the event--they just present the facts of the tragedy and its aftermath with breathtaking camera work.  I have rarely seen a lens capture the feeling of the people with such acumen ever before, save for the famous historical photographs of the National Geographic Society.  This book represents more than photojournalism; it represents true art.  Keep this book on the coffee table for years to come.	2002-10-05

It is a bit peculiar to imagine a simple children's story dissected to pieces, but the researchers and editors behind this volume from Norton (purveyors of some of the best academic editions) bring new light to the hidden humor and brilliance behind Lewis Carroll's works.  Featuring original artwork from the first edition, as well as some abandoned passages, you will not find a more complete version of Carroll's Alice tales anywhere else.

It is like a paperback musical glossary that defines the broadest ideas and terms within the classical music world, in language that is easily understood.  You will not see as much detail within the entries as you would find, say, in the thrice-as-expensive \\"Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\" (my reference of choice), nor will you find as much enthusiasm for classical music as you would encounter in Karl Haas's \\"Inside Music,\\" two factors which make the NPR book a bit middle-of-the-road.

This is the best collection you will find of the Bach clavier canon outside of the Neue Bach Ausgabe catalog of his entire musical output. Though I have to admit that the print is rather small and difficult to read in places, I've grown accustomed to reading microscopic Baroque scores and had no unusual difficulty playing from the pages. Dover publishes great books at the lowest prices, from Thrift Editions of poetry, short stories, and novellas, to classical music scores, and this edition is perhaps the best value of the latter. Though not as 'standardized' as Schirmer and Carl Fischer, nor as studious as the Urtext version of Bach offered by that conservatory favorite G. Henle Verlag, Dover's Bach-Gesellschaft delivers enough bang for the buck (Bach) to win over both my wallet and a place in my score library.<br />P. S. This book is not recommended for beginners.	2002-09-26

In his monumental work, the \\"Summa Theologia\\" (and, to a lesser extent, the supplementary tract \\"Summa Contra Gentiles\\"), Aquinas kept Aristotelian 'pagan' philosophy alive by applying its principles to the Church. Unfortunately, readers today (save for the most devout, I suppose) hardly have the time to read the whole thing. This is where Boston College's Peter Kreeft helps out. Further concentrating his previous Aquinian abridgment, the \\"Summa of the Summa,\\" Professor Kreeft gives us the most accessible reduction of Aquinas's philosophy with \\"A Shorter Summa.\\" Well-edited, well-translated, and well-organized, this small book is a fantastic summary of the monumental philosophy written centuries ago by the official Doctor of the Church.	2002-09-25

I do regret that the book is not geared toward the A student, but it's just as well that less-than-stellar high schoolers get a much-needed glimmer of hope in terms of higher educational prospects. There are more than forty such colleges out there, of course, but I would recommend Ms. Pope's book as an excellent starting point in your search for the \\"perfect\\" (or as close as you can get) institution.  So before you or your children start firing off applications (and fees) to ranked favorites like Carnegie Mellon, Pitt, Tufts, Notre Dame, Boston U, Wake Forest, and other private schools (or public stars like Michigan, UNC, and California), try this book out first.	2002-09-25

However, after revisiting it later as a student at the University of Florida, I had a change of opinion.<br />Margaret Laurence's independent voice and candid description of the physical and psychological battle of growing old deserve special attention. In Hagar Shipley, she has created a character worthy of contempt, pity, and eventually admiration. Though I wish she had done more with the book's other characters, Laurence's mastery of the protagonist and her ability to mold the reader's reactions to her stand out nonetheless. Before you reach ninety yourself, I recommend that you read this novel.	2002-09-25

However, that is not the case.<br />Karl Haas is to classical music what Carl Sagan was to astronomy--he brings it to the people.  Every day, thousands of listeners tune in to hear Karl Haas's radio show, &quot;Adventures in Good Music,&quot; and this book serves as much more than a program companion.  If you are new to classical music, use this book as an excellent introductory manual and reference (second only to Roger Kamien's &quot;Music: An Introduction&quot;).  And if you are well-versed in the classical music tradition, this book is still a must-have because you will find a more enthusiastic and knowledgable account of the joys of music nowhere else.

Florida's primary aim is not commentary, social criticism (scathing or otherwise), or complaint, but factual study and problem-solving.<br /> The preponderance of data charts and tables in this book may give the appearance of academic cluelessness, which is one of its least attractive qualities considering the 'real world' business audience for which it is targeted. However, the reader cannot neglect the evidence behind Florida's findings that creativity, tolerance, and enterprise are inextricably linked. In addition, some cities' residents have taken issue with the book's various indices (rankings, a la \\"U.S. News & World Report\\") of Bohemianism and entrepreneurial activity, though there really is no need to feel slighted by one's place on such lists (especially when the criteria of measurement were chosen appropriately).<br />Despite these less popular aspects of the book, Florida's contribution still emerges a winner because he is so forward-looking in his characterization of the 38 million-strong \\"creative class,\\" whereas other authors are still busy taking potshots at its collective idiosyncrasies. I believe that the business world, especially human resources departments, can benefit immensely from this book, and that the working conditions for our middle class can greatly improve by drawing on Mr. Florida's inclusiveness-minded recommendations.

Fortunately, I was completely mistaken in my literary apprehensions.<br /> Winchester is a compelling storyteller with an eye for the more bizarre events surrounding otherwise \\"normal\\" projects, in this case the compilation of the monumental OED. His unassuming prose paces well through the many twists and turns in the story's events.  With a sympathetic edge to all characters involved, he relates his details to both enlighten and surprise the reader in every chapter.

What I found between the covers was an attention-starved array of random critiques (random, yet viciously funny) about my preceding generation, the Baby Boomers.<br />Contemporary society has given Mr. Queenan plenty of targets to fire at, and he is as wicked and learned in his attacks as Dennis Miller is with his signature commentary (\\"rants\\") on world events. Queenan's central assertion is that the Boomers had essentially sold out on their Bohemian countercultural beginnings as soon as the income started rolling in, leading them to forsake originality for a herd-mentality of materialism cloaked in self-congratulatory \\"meaningfulness.\\"<br />Insofar as I believe Queenan has captured the nature of the suburbanites' social problems here, this book has perspicacious novelty above and beyond that typically found in the plethora of related magazine articles out there (in the New Yorker, the Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, the New Republic, Esquire, etc.). However, his ascerbic critique of trends in support of his thesis are charged more with scathing vitriol than with careful explication. He jumps from topic to topic without any consideration of continuity so often that his book reads as if he is just answering baited questions asked by some invisible talk show host.<br />I was looking for a fuller argument here than what is provided. I would recommend that the reader first try David Brooks's \\"Bobos in Paradise\\" for a better explanation of the shallowness of Baby Boomers before proceeding to Queenan's work, which does a better job with selective (albeit creative) lambasting than with articulation.	2002-09-22

The reader is left, quite honestly, without a single shred of hope for anyone, which is one of the most souring aspects of this drama.  However, to expose a silver lining is not Mamet's aim.

Or in this review, the audio cassette version, narrated by actor Campbell Scott (of \\"The Spanish Prisoner\\" fame), which has you making extra long road trips just to keep on listening. It is amazing to think that so many readers who have had nothing to do with horses or horse racing in the past have flocked to this book by the droves.<br /> Ms. Hillenbrand has remarkable talent, and in the end she will have you cheering for an underrated, lopsided racehorse you've never met. Now that's something.	2002-09-21

It's not that you're not intelligent or avant-garde enough; it's just that the poetry of today really is bizarre.<br /> For you, reader, I recommend Billy Collins. He is critically acclaimed indeed--the Library of Congress' U.S. Poet Laureate, in fact--but he is also approachably good. Like Garrison Keillor, Mr. Collins understands the value of writing funny, and his dry, New York wit punctuates each verse like a breath of fresh air. When I first heard him read his poetry on NPR, I realized that there really is good poetry being written out there in America. Collins is the real thing, and it's writers like him that are bringing poetry back to popularity. I truly admire his work, and you will too.	2002-09-20

This is the book on which her television course is based. \\"From Socrates to Sartre\\" is a brief, yet thought-provoking analysis of six major Western philosophers: Socrates, Descartes, Hume, Hegel, Marx, and Sartre. Interspersed between the discussions of these six thinkers are brief chapters about transformational periods in Western philosophy and their major figures (e.g., Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, Leibniz, Husserl, etc.). Though I regret that some of these other major philosophers are given rather cursory treatment, at least they are mentioned. Had the author given every major philosopher full treatment, she would have written a much less welcoming book for the neophyte student.<br /> That leaves us with Professor Lavine's detailed and candid exploration of the six philosophers she has aptly chosen. Her writing style is straightforward and crafted with just the right mix of serious complexity and common-sense explanation. Some parts of the chapters get overloaded with raised questions, but that is what philosophy is all about. Rather than guide the reader through what ought to be thought, she leaves many of these questions open, prompting the sort of self-examination that is the crucial basis of any introductory philosophical survey. I would recommend this book, really only second to Will Durant's THE STORY OF PHILOSOPHY (and, I guess, Thomas Nagel's WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?, too), to any reader curious about exploring the history of the Western philosophical tradition.	2002-09-20

There is little literary complexity in this book--no motifs or worldly metaphors, no multi-layered narrative, no grand apotheosis, sometimes no real plots--just twisted plots about dogs, three-legged dogs, guys with cat faces, talking dogs, chainsaws, and dog-human hybrids. Bradford, who bears an uncanny resemblance to actor Jason Lee (of \\"Clerks\\" and \\"Chasing Amy\\" fame), writes in an unassuming style that never fails to please the reader, perhaps because he demands little more than simply reading and reacting to his idiosyncratic (and truly funny) tales. Which is precisely the straightforward appeal of this collection. So if you need a breather after \\"War and Peace,\\" check out \\"Dogwalker.\\" Give your mind a rest and your senses a bit of a shock.	2002-09-20

The grand scope of this book is executed with such mastery of content, voice, and detail that I would not hesitate to call this one the most outstanding histories of medicine ever written.

And, like all students past, you won't have a clue about what in the world the good doctor was saying. Dr. Osler was a peerless medical scholar, an erudite man of letters whose vast learning towered over that of his contemporaries and even moreso of the doctors of today. He was to medicine what Samuel Johnson was to lexicography. Unless you have degrees in philosophy, philology, literature, and classics (in addition to medicine), you will most likely be just as confused as you will be inspired by Dr. Osler's writing.<br />Thankfully, we have this new book from Duke University Press. With more annotations than a Harvard Law Review issue, this well-selected sample of Dr. Osler's most well-known papers and addresses presents an effective \\"translation\\" to satisfy all medical scholars who, though they seek to emulate Osler's compassion and skill, just can't understand all of his references. When I first read \\"Aequanimitas,\\" I felt like an ignoramus. After reading it again in this present volume, I felt like an enlightened student eager to carry the Aesculapian staff into the new milennium (or something like that). I highly recommend this book to all medical students and physicians who seek a model of professional excellence in Dr. Osler, but who have heretofore scratched their heads when reading his papers. Revisit \\"A Way of Life.\\" Read the footnotes. Then don your white coat, tend to your patients, and be proud of the great American medical tradition set forth by Dr. Osler so many years ago.	2002-09-18

In his book, \\"Readings: Essays and Literary Entertainments,\\" Dirda assembles forty-six of his best essays (all of his Book World editorial columns are good) to delight the reader who, like him, is an incurable book aficionado.<br /> Although the idea of reading a book about reading books may sound a bit redundant, Dirda's exciting, humorous, wide-ranging, and engaging narrative will not lose the reader's attention. He is a scholarly bibliophile in every sense of the term, minus any pretension. His love of books is infectious, and there is no escaping Dirda's charm and wit. The chapters \\"The Crime of His Life,\\" \\"Listening to My Father,\\" \\"Mr. Wright,\\" \\"Commencement Advice,\\" \\"Clubland,\\" \\"Turning 50,\\" and \\"Bookman's Saturday\\" are especially good.<br /><br /> For the reader who finds himself (or herself) swamped with reading wish-lists, tirelessly hunting for a first edition, obsessing over collecting all of a particular author's works, finding unparalleled solace in the library, and generally spending more time reading than doing anything else, this is the book for you.  I have seen Mr. Dirda speak about this book on C-SPAN2's \\"Book TV\\" and on open university's \\"The Writing Life,\\" and he is just as enthusiastic about reading in person as he is on paper.

Bliss presents us with a detailed, well-paced, and engaging biography of Dr. Osler, from his childhood days in Canada to his final years at Oxford. Being both a student of medicine and a Baltimorean (currently), I took a special interest to the chapters devoted to his post as the first chief of medicine at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br /> Unlike the time-honored work by Cushing, Bliss's book is no hagiography; it makes no false overtures about Dr. Osler's iconic grandeur, instead letting the reader discover for himself (or herself) that Dr. Osler was, in fact, as great a man as people say he was. (All that being said, I still value the two-volume Cushing biography, and there is no way I will rid myself of the precious first-edition set I snatched up last year at the Maryland Historical Society bookshop!)<br /> One need not practice Oslerolatry (that is, the veritable worship of Dr. Osler expressed by many of the older faculty at Hopkins and elsewhere) to appreciate this book, though having an interest in medicine and/or medical history may help. Critics often lament that American doctors no longer have any professional integrity, and that taking the Hippocratic Oath is a sham. Read this book, and discover how great the American physician can be...and THEN lament that they don't make them like they used to.	2002-09-18

His coverage is by no means comprehensive, for snobbery is truly a broad topic, but Epstein touches well on those aspects of \\"the grave but localized disease\\" that are frequently encountered, and that he is most familiar with.<br /> The book is divided into two parts. The first part (chapters one through ten) seeks (and finds) a fair definition of what snobbery is, explains how it works, and traces the history of snobbery in America from its revolutionary origins, to its classist WASP height, and finally to its omnipresent state in our current \\"egalitarian\\" times. Epstein makes especially good use of his popular self-deprecating humor in the first chapter, \\"It Takes One to Know One.\\" The second part (chapters eleven through twenty-three) describes several prominent varieties of modern snobbery, such as college snobbery (\\"Jimmy goes to Rice, Jane goes to Vanderbilt\\"), club snobbery, intellectual snobbery, political snobbery, name-dropping, sexual and religious prejudice, celebrity hobnobbing, food and wine snobbery, and trend-following. The book is closed with a final chapter, the \\"Coda,\\" where Epstein explains why he believes that snobbery, though it is a deplorable social practice, is here to stay. The mock reviews printed on the jacket's back cover (from Henry James, Oscar Wilde, Marcel Proust, and Noel Coward) provide some good laughs for the familiar reader.<br /> I know that I gave a rather critical review of Epstein's earlier book, \\"Ambition\\" (c. 1980), but this new volume (though it addresses a related topic) is quite different. Epstein's writing here is very much of the current times, and his narrative never loses the reader's attention. Quotations are always brief and used to explain a point, not invoked merely for pedantic decoration. Rather than spending time on describing famous historical snobs (as was done in previous \\"snobographies\\" by Thackeray and the Duke of Bedford), Epstein concentrates more on exposing the practice of snobbery as it is seen in everyday life today, among his colleagues and acquaintances, in contemporary magazines, and (most insightfully) within his own thoughts. As he rightfully suspects, his detailed look at major types of snobbery lets very few people off the hook, and there is scarcely a reader out there who won't find his or her own pet version(s) of snobbery described within the book's pages. I have seen Epstein field questions from audience members during a book talk featured on C-SPAN2's \\"Book TV,\\" and the identification of secret snobs through the Q&A session was remarkable.

Within the four chapters, Kennedy provides a sharp introduction, a legal lookback, a list of political backfirings, and a brief epilogue. The voluminous endnotes, typical of legal writing, show the breadth and scope of the author's background research.<br />Unfortunately, Kennedy's discussions seem, for the most part, only half-considered. All too often, he takes a particular controversial event surrounding the use of the word, describes what transpired accurately (and with hefty annotated documentation), but neglects to explain his opinion on the matter and justify it. There are some notable exceptions, such as his account of the Webster's Dictionary petition, but these are few. I also personally disagreed with many of his conclusions, such as his suggestion that we adopt a more relaxed attitude toward the word when it is used by African Americans.<br />For such a heavy topic, Professor Kennedy offers more legal history than well-argued current opinion. I recommend this book both for its boldness in addressing such a controversial issue, and for its brevity, but I feel that the reader cannot rely solely on this book for a more enlightened view of the African American battle against racism.	2002-08-16

The grand subject of ambition has changed quite a bit over the past twenty years, and the contemporary reader may find Mr. Epstein's insights, though comprehensive in scope, behind the times. Although Epstein's historical anecdotes can be witty and original, the way in which he approaches the general subject of ambition unfortunately raises more questions than answers. If you are hoping for some meaningful self-help guidance from this volume, prepare to be both disappointed and further bewildered. (And if you are socialist--which I am not, incidentally--prepare to be insulted.)<br /> The first chapters of the book lack a satisfactory pace, but it picks up during the second half. Epstein's take on the world of high American Society in the chapter on Edith Wharton is especially entertaining, and reads a lot like his current book, \\"Snobbery: The American Version.\\" The subsequent chapter on F. Scott Fitzgerald, failure, and intergenerational downshifting is downright depressing. One detects a sharp note of disapproval from Epstein towards people who seek to simplify their lives by setting their career goals with modesty. Were he to write this chapter during the current epidemic of corporate scandal and societal Affluenza, I wonder if he would reach the same conclusions. The final chapter on Wallace Stevens extolls the virtues of a bourgeois man driven by immediate career satisfaction, but who still supplied time for poetry on the side. I was surprised to see Epstein write so glowingly about what seems to me as the dullest representative of ambition mentioned in his book.<br /> In the end, the reader is left with a short epilogue that, again, fails to make much sense of the myriad of open questions that surface when contemplating the role of ambition in one's life. Epstein's buried thesis, that ambition does not deserve the scorn it often receives, just doesn't provide enough specifics about the degree and nature of today's laudable goals to be of any real use. As disagreeable as I found this book, I stuck through its 300 pages to discover only a handful of noteworthy passages.

The chapters are arranged progressively according to both the age of the writers at the time they began writing the most celebrated parts of their journals, and to the time period in which they lived. For each chapter, Johnson slightly modifies her style to best capture the spirit of the particular writer's life, as recorded in her diary. It is a very effective narrative device, executed with remarkable precision, a style that is very difficult to carry off without sounding artificial and capricious.<br />The role of memoir is often underestimated outside of literary fiction, but its importance is gaining ground.  One need not be an English major at some liberal arts college like Amherst, Swarthmore, Smith, Vassar, Mount Holyoke, or Sarah Lawrence, to find the subject relevant and interesting. For example, we often rely on patient memoir as medical narrative in my graduate program in biomedical ethics at the University of Maryland. History, law, and even business are focusing more attention on personal narratives now than in years past. Still, it is in the diaries of writers where we find the most inspiring stories.<br />In Johnson's book, the frustrations and insecurities of hailed writers are laid bare for us both in their journal excerpts and in the author's impressive ancillary research, making these past figures seem ever more human than what we usually grasp from reading their fiction. The incipient chapter on Marjory Fleming, with its occassional comparisons of the central figure to other important juvenile femmes de plume (Anne Frank and the young Bronte sisters), fills the reader with both charming amusement at how such a young girl could write like such an adult, and with awe at her gifted literary ability, which was cut so short by an early death. The next two chapters, on Sonya Tolstoy and Alice James, show us the age-old struggle of the aspiring female writer against male-imposed (both societal and familial) restrictions to her creative expression. These are among the most emotionally frustrating chapters; they often reminded me of the classes I took as a Women's Studies minor in college.<br />My favorite chapter is about the relationship between the great Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield, as recorded in their diaries. The way that Johnson writes about these two, one can feel the writers living and breathing, conversing and writing, fretting and maligning, praising and rejoicing in their shared and individual literary triumphs and (often self-perceived) failures. Of all the chapters, this one is a true must-read for the bookworm short on time.<br />The following chapter on the provocative (and promiscuous) Anais Nin reads almost like a confessional more than a biography. The most interesting points of this entry are where Nin confronts her own dishonesty within her diary's pages--the 'cardinal sin' of journal-keeping. Without saying so explicitly, Johnson shows the reader by example how important it is to keep one's diary devoid of any false stories or feelings. The last chapter on May Sarton is like smiling into the day's end--the golden years of one's life published in best-selling diaries. One is never too old to begin, I suppose.<br />The six chapters are capped by a prologue and epilogue, both in the form of diary entries (they may very well be) from Johnson's contemporary life. This book, unlike so many other nonfiction books of its kind out there, reads like a seamless biography that entertains, informs, and (most importantly) moves the reader to a better appreciation of the interior lives of some great (and some overlooked) female writers and diarists. It is a book for reflection on the power and value of keeping a diary (or 'journal,' for us men), and for motivation for all of us to start keeping one of our own.on Sonya Tolstoy and Alice James, show us the age-old struggle of the aspiring female writer against male-imposed (both societal and familial) restrictions to her creative expression.

But upon reading the first part of this concise and well-documented book, it became clear to me just how rotten at heart our intellectual heroes truly were.  Carey finds a wealth of unnerving evidence that the great figures (self-appointed \\"greats,\\" as this book shows us) of the modern literary canon festered with hatred of the common man, so much that they advocated (oftentimes straightforwardly) wiping out all of humanity.  Moreso, the various case studies in the book's second part uncover further details about just how much these great writers loathed the \\"masses,\\" and the strange, selfish reasons behind their disdain.<br />  This is an excellent read for anyone struggling through \\"Ulysses,\\" \\"To the Lighthouse,\\" or even \\"The Wasteland.\\"  Carey's thorough research and well-argued points shed much-needed light on the dark side of our past century's most celebrated authors: why they wrote in such an unreachable voice, why they crafted their themes to be so alien to most people, why they lived where they did, and (most importantly) how much worthier they took themselves as human beings.  I did groan a bit during the final chapter, which was about Wyndham Lewis and Hitler.  Dropping the \\"H-bomb\\" can make anything seem evil and was therefore too easy a potshot for Carey to take at the intellectuals.  Also, the two back-to-back case studies on H. G. Wells were somewhat redundant; Carey would have done better to write two case studies on two separate writers.  Still, this book gives the reader an exciting, enlightening, and shocking view at the world of the intellectuals between 1880 and 1939 (and, in the Postscript, a look at similar currents in today's postmodern world), and I highly recommend it to any fan of modern literature who is not afraid to explore the ugly side of the great writers.rature who is not afraid to explore the ugly side of the great writers.	2002-07-30
