This book has been wonderful!  As a 29 year-old bachelor I have never learned to cook and lived for years on pre-made foods.  As I'm settling down now with my love, I decided I had to learn to cook.  But in the past I found cookbooks and friends who tried to show me to cook very frustrating because rather than truly teaching, they assume that you know a lot of things and haphazardly tell yuo what to do on a certain recipe. <br />    I wanted to learn to cook in a methodical well thought out way from the bottom up.  This book was the solution!  It starts with descriptions of essential cooking preperation techniques and what ingredients and tools you should have in your kitchen.  It goes through very simple recipes and gradually builds to harder recipes.  Each recipe explains the fine points of how to prepare it.  In other words, it really \\"teaches\\" you to cook rather than \\"telling\\" you how to prepare a recipe.  And it does it well! <br />    I only found two small downsides.  As I went through the book, sometimes I craved a few fancier and stronger flavored recipes, but the recipes were all very enjoyable and designed at an appropriate level of difficulty.  It also would be nice if they had pictures to illustrate and inspire. <br />    Over the last six months, I have gradually gone through 80% of the recipes.  I'm excited becasue some of the best recipes are still to come, and now I'm looking forward to what cookbooks I'll start studying next! <br />    This book was what I needed to help me go from a non-cooking bachelor to a cook for life.  I hope it will help you too.	2005-07-09

Although to be fair, I've read some specifications, like the EJB specification, that are more focused than this book.  Any good trainer or training author knows that you have to organize your material to first put the emphasis on the central introductory concepts.  Once your audience understands the basics, then you can build upon that foundation to explain the advanced topics.  Along the way, you should always put the main focus on the most important topics, and just briefly mention extraneous details.  Unfortunatley, this book does not organize the material for learning and covers everything with approximately the same emphasis.  As just one example of this, Chapter 1 spends eight LONG pages on the history of XSLT including details like when so-and-so joined the specification team or presented a paper at a conference.  What Chapter 1 does not do is give you any idea of how to write an XSLT sheet.  I plodded my way through the first two chapters wondering when we'd get past all the gory details to a description of how to write an introductory XSLT sheet.  Finally, I had enough and looked through the book trying to find how far I should jump ahead to find the introductory section, and realized it didn't exist.  All the basics are interspersed with endless details throughout the book. <br />To be fair, the book calls itself a \\"programmer's reference.\\"  So one could argue that it shouldn't be designed to learn XSLT.  However, trying to use this book as a reference would be equally probelmatic because its too hard to find the important information among all the extraneous details. <br />So if you already know XSLT well and want to know all the extra details, I truly do highly recommend this book.  But if you want to learn XSLT in a resonable amount of time, I strongly recommend against this book.	2004-11-21

Overall, I think it is a fairly solid coverage of EJBs.  However, I think it tocuhes on many topics without providing enough depth to make that topic clear and useful.  One of the worst examples of this is Chapter 6, entitled Using JMS and Connectors For Communication.  The chapter has a rather brief high level coverage of JMS which is too short and sporadic to be terribly useful.  Then is jumps to J2EE Connectors which it discusses for one and a half pages.  In those 1.5 pages it gives no examples and almost no concrete information about how to use connectors.  The most useful thing it says is it tells you another book you can buy to actually learn how to use connectors.  Since the chapter is called &quot;Using JMS and Connectors...&quot; I would expect more than 1.5 pages of fluffy coverage of connectors.  But at least it told me what book I should have bought instead.<BR>   If you want a high-level view of a lot of topics, without a whole lot of depth, then I think this book is a good choice.  If you want a more thorough coverage of EJBs, I'd recommend Head First EJB, Enterprise JavaBeans (O'Reilly Press), or Professional EJB (Wrox Press.)	2004-05-26

I was thrilled when I saw Richard Monson-Haefel had written a web services book because several years ago his wonderful EJB book got me started with EJBs.  So I had high expectations for this book, and I was not dissapointed.  This is the most thorough coverage of J2EE web services that I've read.  Equally important as what is in the book, is what is not in the book.  Web services is a topic that can be an endless pit of specifications and APIs that you will never use.  By focusing on technologies that are endorsed by the Basic Profile for Web Services, this book helps you focus on those technologies that are currently useful and stable.  I've found most web services books get so lost in every specification and version that they never have time to really explain the practical issues of developing web services.  This book instead provides tremendous detail on the important practical issues.  In addition, by focusing on the stable and interoperable aspects of web services, the book will makes it easy to see how to develop web services that will actually work and be interoperable.  And most importantly, the book is clearly written, technically accurate, and easy to learn from.  So I thank the author for another wonderful book and I hope he will be writing books in all the future topics I need to learn.	2004-03-15

I was hopeful that the other reviewers were just being too harsh.  But after reading the first couple chapters, it became clear that the other reviewers were being charitable.  This book is filled with errors and is poorly organized.<BR>    The worst error I've spotted is on p16.  The book says that &quot;The current version of the SCEA exam tests your knowledge of J2EE 1.3 API.&quot;  In fact, at the time I'm writing this review, and certainly at the time they wrote the book, the current version of the exam is still testing the J2EE 1.2 API.  That is pretty bad when the course authors don't even know which version of J2EE they should be writing about.  It also would be quite detrimental and confusing to readers who would assume they should be studying topics that were added in the J2EE 1.3 version.<BR>    In many places, the book also does not seem to be well synched with the topics, approach, and vocabulary of the exam.  Some chapters seemed almost irrelevant to the exam.<BR>    If you buy this book, you should only consider it a supplement to help give you a general idea of what you need to study.  I would suggest doing most of your studying with other books or resources.	2003-10-06

For each problem pointed out by the AntiPattern, the book also describes how you can refactor your design to avoid this problem.  I strongly recommend that all J2EE architects, designers, and coders read both an AntiPattern book and a \\"positive\\" pattern book.  It is very valuable to read books such as Core J2EE Patterns or EJB Design Patterns to find out positive patterns for J2EE design.  Books like J2EE AntiPatterns provide the flip side of the coin by pointing out what you shouldn't do in your J2EE design.	2003-08-25

There have been several respectable books written on AntiPatterns for general topics and J2SE. There are also a couple of excellent books on EJB and other J2EE patterns. But, until now, there has been a void of AntiPattern books relating to EJB or other J2EE topics. AntiPattern books fill an important need because they help developers understand the serious problems they need to avoid. With complex topics like EJBs, AntiPatterns are particularly important.<BR>There are a few parts of this book that discuss the pros and cons of the EJB architecture. But, the primary focus of this book is to help EJB developers and designers get the most out of their use of EJB technology. The book does this by focusing on the bitter mistakes that you can make and explaining how to avoid or rectify those mistakes.<BR>I think every EJB developer or designer should read this AntiPattern book and a \\"positive\\" pattern book such as EJB Design Patterns or Core J2EE Patterns.<BR>Before reading this book, you should have a solid general understanding of EJBs, such as could be gained from books like Enterprise JavaBeans by Haefel or Mastering EJB by Roman.	2003-06-13

I appreciate that this book not only covers the technical issues, but has a nice coverage of many business and formatting issues of creating good newsletters, brochures, and other documents.  Overall it provides a good introduction to the very wide variety of technical, business, and formatting issues relating to making a very wide variety of documents.  So to the fairly casual or introductory reader, I would recommend this book.<BR>    Unfortunately, I was not in that group.  I am very familiar with similar software, I've developed newsletters and similar documents for years, and I've used Publisher briefly for a few weeks.  I was hoping for a book that would get down into the nuts and bolts of using Publisher and I found the book was lacking in that respect.  It took a long time to sift through all the introductory and general information to find the nuggets on advanced features.  At the end of doing this, I still had many unanswered questions about how to get the most out of Publisher.  So, I would not recommend this book for more experienced readers.<BR>Happy reading.	2003-03-20

It is not going to teach you J2EE development, and it is not going to help you figure out exactly how you should approach a J2EE development project.  What it does do very well is to give a small sampling of how J2EE is successfully being used in very diverse industries.  Since these are only a handful of case studies, this book really only provides anecodtal stories of success, rather than scientific proof.  But, I found these anecodtal stories to be a fascinating quick read in order to gather more information on how different companies have been approaching enterprise development with J2EE.  Some reviewers criticized the blatant product marketting in the book, but since the products being marketted are a wide variety of competing J2EE servers, I found that quite interesting.  <BR>    The reason I give this book a 5 star rating is because I think that for the kind of book it is trying to be, it does a very good job.  If you already have a good knowledge of J2EE technologies, and would like to know a bit more about how other companies are utilizing J2EE technologies, I recommend picking this book up and giving it a quick read by skimming past the parts that aren't as applicable to you.	2003-01-27

However, if you want to learn more about Ant, Junit, Cactus, HttpUnit, JMeter, or JunitPerf this book is probably one of your best choices.<BR>The book has one dedicated chapter on Extreme Programming and certainly incorporates an Extreme Programming perspective, but this is not really a book about Extreme Programming.  If you want to learn about Extreme Programming this is not the book for you.  If you don't care about Extreme Programming, you can skip the one chapter on it and benefit from the rest of the book.<BR>The book aslo waists one chapter and other miscelaneous pages discussing how to deploy J2EE applications.  If you want to learn how to develop or deploy servlets, JSP, EJB, and other J2EE technologies, this will not be sufficient material to properly introduce you to it, and you should buy other books for that purpose.  If you already are a J2EE developer, then you already know most of what this book says about servlets, JSPs, and EJBs and you will probably want to skim or skip these pages.<BR>The book also spends one chapter and many other miscelaneous pages on substantial case studies which may be quite useful to some people, but arguably are of limited value to most people.<BR>However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  The coverage of Ant, JUnit, Cactus, HttpUnit, JMeter, and JUnitPerf is quite good.  The writing style is very clear and easy to learn from.  The coverage could be more comprehensive, but it is certainly will give you a very strong start with these tools and does go into some advanced topics.  In addition, most of these tools don't have many if any books that significanly discuss them, so this coverage is something of a rare find.  <BR>    The last quarter of the book is an API reference.  The API reference does have some useful dicusssion and details of the parts of the API.  So while I find API references to be of limited value in a book, this API reference is moderately useful.<BR>    In summary:  If you want to learn about some good open source tools for Java deployment and testing (Ant, JUnit, Cactus, HttpUnit, JMeter, and JUnitPerf,) then I highly recommend this book, but you should expect to skim past several parts of the book to get to the good parts.  If you want a book on Extreme Programming or general Java development, then this is the wrong book for you.	2002-10-28

Instead, it just spends page after page describing all the different technologies competing in the SOAP and web services arena.  Upon completing reading this book, I had a much better understanding of what was happening in the chaotic development of SOAP, but I would not be able to develop anything using SOAP.  This seems to be typical of this author's other books.  I've read three of Brogden's books and they all tend to get bogged down in specification versions, generic overviews of APIs, and other occassionally interesting but not usually very useful informaiton.  Then he doesn't take the time to carefully explain HOW to use the technologies in a practical way.  This will be my last Brogden book.	2002-07-28

So when I found this book that was supposed to cover both of these topics, I was quite pleased and bought it.  Unfortunately, what I found out is that there is one chapter on JNDI, one chapter on JAXP, one chapter on EJB, and the other 16 chapters are on JDBC.  I found the JNDI coverage to be acceptable, but certainly very short, and lacking in some areas.  I found the JAXP coverage to be almost useless.<BR>   Although I know JDBC well, I figured I might as well read the rest of the book to recover some value from my purchase.  I was surprised to find that the JDBC chapters were excellent.  I learned many new things that I did not know about JDBC.  Overall, I would say that this is the best JDBC coverage I've seen in any book.<BR>    So, if you're looking for a JDBC book I believe you'll be extremely pleased with this book.  For just the JDBC section, I would give the book a perfect 5 rating.<BR>    However, if you are looking for a JAXP or JNDI book I believe you will be quite disappointed.  For those topics I would give the book a 2 rating.	2002-05-26

It is also an excellent book for people who are new to servlets &amp; JSP, but I'll clarify that at the end of my review.  The book is definitely worth 5 starts.  The first star is for Marty Hall's clear and direct writing style.  The second star is for being one of the few books that is currently up to date with the newest servlet &amp; JSP specifications.  The third star is for having very practical and useful content such as solid coverage of web application deployment.  The fourth star is for being the first book that I've read that has detailed coverage of how to use SSL with servlets.  The fifth star is for having source code, sample chapters, and a slew of prequel chapters freely available online.<BR>    If you read and enjoyed Mr. Hall's &quot;Core Servlets &amp; JSP&quot;, this book is well worth buying also.  Be aware, the first 240 pages is an introduction which is essentially a reduced and updated form of the &quot;Core&quot; book.  But the other 450 pages is all new and extremely good content.  Even without the first 240 pages, the other 450 pages is worth the purchase price alone.<BR>    If you are brand new to Servlet &amp; JSPs you may want to first buy &quot;Core Servlets &amp; JSPs&quot; for a slower introduction to these topics.  But, make sure you come back and buy this book because you will definitely want some of the updated and advanced topics such as &quot;web applications.&quot;  Alternatively, you can go ahead and buy this book and read some of the prequel chapters that Mr. Hall has online.<BR>    I haven't been fortunate enough to attend one myself, but I've also heard wonderful things about the onsite and public training servlet &amp; JSP training classes that Mr. Hall offers.<BR>    In short, it's a great book.

EJB is a very large and challenging topic to explain to beginning EJB developers.  The authors do an excellent job of explaining the concepts in a very clear and well thought out manner.  The book is very focused on those topics that are most important to the beginning EJB developer and clarifies them wonderfully.  I believe individuals who have already been programming EJBs for a little while will also enjoy this book as a way to add depth and clarity to their EJB knowledge.  The author's inter-mingle a substantial number of &quot;best-practices,&quot; and advanced issues that will be very interesting to the new and old EJB developer.  <br />If you have the time and patience to read a 1200 page book, &quot;Professional EJB&quot; by Wrox Press covers a lot more material and depth.  However, if you don't have the time, patience, or desire to read a 1200 page book, this &quot;Mastering EJBs&quot; book is much more manageable and focused at 600 pages.  The O'Reilly press &quot;Enterprise Java Beans&quot; book by Monson-Haefel is also quite good.  However, like most O'Reilly books, I think it is actually too focused and doesn't provide a clear enough picture of how the whole EJB world fits together.  So if you want a moderate size book with excellent explanations, good level of depth, and excellent insights, this book is it. <BR>Enjoy!	2002-04-01

This book is perfect for brand new beginners.

The authors have clearly been doing requirements gathering for years and are kind of enough to share volumes of their hard fought wisdom with the rest of us.  I found parts of the book, especially the beginning, a little slow to get to the point.  However you can just skim any parts that might be a little drawn out and there is more than enough outstanding content to make it very worthwhile.  This book provides wonderful insight, persuasive arguments, multiple views and ideas for how requirements are best gathered, a clear style of explaining concepts, and a pleasant and entertaining writing style.  Requirements gathering is such a large topic that the book could not possibly teach EVERYTHING you might ever need to know about requirements gathering, but it gives an outstanding basis from which you can continue to build in whichever directions are most appropriate for you.  A very expereienced requirements gatherer might find the book somewhat introductory but would certainly still gain wonderful insights from parts of the book.  I think both beginners and experts will benefit from this book.	2002-03-21

This book provides a great introduction to what refactoring is and a great reference for how to refactor.  The first few chapters are crucial for every computer programmer and project manager to read.  These first chapters will clearly explain how and why you need to be refactoring.  The later chapters go through various refactoring patterns.  These later chapters will be very useful to programmers with less OO programming experience but may be less useful to many programmers.

It is extremely thorough, well written, and clear.  It has a distrinct habit of repeating itself.  Many topics appear about three times in the book. At first, I found this bothersome.  I would read something and think, &quot;Didn't I already read that before?&quot;  However, I believe this is done because the topic is quite intense and often you need to see the major points from different perspectives and have some repetition.  In the end, I think the repetition is very effective, especailly if you know ahead of time to expect it.  If you are completely new to EJBs and have never done anything similar to EJBs before, you might want to pick up a lighter book first.  But, for anyone who is ready to dive in, this is fantastic.	2001-06-21

I was shocked to discover error after error.  In some cases, it was just misleading, in other cases it was blatantly wrong.  If you just want to better understand the technologies and you are willing to deal with some errors, then this book is a good choice.  But, if you want to make sure you understand exactly how the technologies work (and not be misled,) then stay away from this book.	2000-10-20

It will not teach you every single detail of UML or system design.  But, it will give you everything you need to get going.  I would recommend this as  a first book for anybody studying UML who already has some object oriented  experience.  Then, as you spend more time with OO design, you may want more  detailed books.	2000-02-02

But, if you really want to learn and use Java, there are much better books.  The title says it all.  If you are a complete idiot, then  this book is great.  But, Java programming is not meant for complete  idiots.  If you are not a complete idiot and you want to learn Java, choose  a book that has better and clearer explanations.  The explanations in this  book are too vague and brief, to really make it clear how to utilize the  language.	1999-12-22

This book tries to be everything to everybody and ends up being nothing to anybody. Despite its claim, you can not learn to program from this book.  If you have very little programming experience, you will find this book  very confusing.  If you know a lot of progeamming then you will probably be  annoyed by the lack of details and the time spent on easy topics.  The only  redeeming value of this book is that it may give you a few creative ideas  that you can develop on your own or with better books.	1999-04-10

I have taught about five classes to beginning programmers using the previous version of this book.  It is outstanding.  The students absolutely love this book and find it extremely easy to learn from.  It has a very  easy to follow step by step approach.  Although it makes a great textbook,  it is so self explanatory that it also would be great for someone trying to  learn on their own.       It won't teach everything you might eventually  want to know about Visual Basic.  But, it will get you an excellent start.   If you succesfully complete this book, you should move on to other VB books  to get more details.  The Deitel &amp; Deitel book calld Visual Basic 6:  How To Program is a great choice.  It is a bit advanced for first time  programmers, but if you do this book first, the Deitel book will make a lot  more sense and teach you a lot more details.     In summary, this is the  best and easiest way to learn Visual Basic for beginning programmers.	1999-04-10

I have worked a little bit with ActiveX, but I was looking for a book that would clearly explain the different elements of ActiveX programming.  Unfortunately, this book does not do that.  The examples rely so heavily on  the wizards that most of the code is written automaically.  It then  explains almost none of the code.  Thus, after reading this book, it would  still be difficult to do ActiveX development because, you wouldn't know  what all the code was for.          The first chapter is particularly poor.   It is a review of Visual Basic which is pointless if you know VB, and way  too short to be useful if you don't know VB.      If you want a book to  supplement other books on ActiveX, this is an okay choice.  But, I would  not reccomend it as a primary source to learn ActiveX.	1998-11-16
