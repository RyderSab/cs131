Author Chion devotes a lot of space in this book to comparing each of Malick's three films to one another.  Hard to tell if Chion is very insightful or just grabbing for straws sometimes.<br /><br />Of note, Chion wrote this text in French and only later was it translated into English.  It is significant because the same translation issue comes into play watching the film with French subtitles.  Some of the characters' inner-monologues in the film have words and expressions that just aren't directly translatable into other languages.  Chion, being bilingual, has the interesting perspective of experiencing the film in both languages and can make comparisons between the two, noting subtle and not-so-subtle differences in interpretations.<br /><br />I believe that to get the most out of this book one should have seen the film multiple times.  But if you are thinking of buying this book, chances are you have already seen the film mulitple times anyway.<br /><br />And for good reason.<br /><br />Recommended book, though a large percentage of seems to be more about Malick's body of work than this particular film.	2005-07-18

This isn't one of the more in-depth or scholarly analyses in the BFI series, but it does make a good companion piece to the film (and to the 1952 \\"The Thing From Another World\\" film version of the short story - \\"Who Goes There?\\" - that Carpenter's 1982 film is based on).<br /><br />In a nutshell, Bilson asserts that the film critics who panned the film upon its initial release completely missed the boat and the point.  This film was original in so many underappreciated ways, and it remains to this day a standard-bearer.<br /><br />The author explores the idea that the titular Thing may as well be, for all intents and purpose, female.  That, and that Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster were both very brave and correct to dodge conventional Hollywood wisdom by casting the film with all-male and mostly lesser-known actors, and that the timing of the making of the film thankfully preceeded the political-correctness period that now practically mandates a Rainbow Coalition of skin colors.  Clearly, Carpenter was focused solely on the story, and kept all other interferences at bay.<br /><br />One of my favorite assertions that Bilson makes, and I am certainly in agreement with her, is that if the AFI list of Greatest Film Quotes of All Time allowed for profanity, \\"The Thing\\" would be well-represented!<br /><br />This isn't the most thought-provoking BFI entry, but it is affectionately written, for sure, without being kissy-kissy.<br /><br />I still love this book series, however.  I always ask for a BFI book for my birthday.  Next BFI books up for me:  \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", \\"Crash\\", and \\"The Thin Red Line\\".<br /><br />Stay tuned.	2005-07-04

His analysis of \\"Heat\\" as an ode to the 80's (in part, though made and set in the 1990's), as both celebration and criticism of machismo, and as testimonial of how Mann can be called a \\"method director\\" not unlike De Niro's habit of being a \\"method actor\\" (pardon the overused and often misplaced term), is as much tribute to Mann as it is a tribute to the art of storytelling on the often expansive canvas of film.<br /><br />Of the half-dozen or so BFI series books I've read so far, this one ranks near the top of my enjoyment list.  James' writing is scholarly without being pretentious [at least one BFI series book I have read cannot make the same claim].  Though perhaps not as enlightening as the BFI book on \\"Titanic\\" or as profound as a passage or two in the BFI book on \\"Jaws\\" (though that book does have some flaws, hate to say), it is more than compelling enough to keep me hooked on the series.<br /><br />I will make a point to purchase and read the BFI books on \\"Crash\\", \\"The Right Stuff\\", \\"The Thin Red Line\\" (FOR GOD'S SAKE, EVERYBODY SEE THAT MOVIE!!), and \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\".  I have the BFI book on \\"The Thing\\" in the on-deck circle and will start it tomorrow.	2005-06-27
US	50819579	RUHD2BWMG5NQS	0851707602	237520167	Titanic	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	Better than I thought it would be	For a movie that was almost universally loathed by \\"high-brow\\" critics, \\"Titanic\\" gets a very lovingly detailed and in-depth analysis courtesy of Mr. Lubin.  His analysis is interesting and well-researched without going too overboard or reaching too far for metaphors and artsy-fartsy obscure parallels, as some BFI contributing authors have.<br /><br />This book afforded me a fascinating 12th look at a film I've already seen 11 times, and I feel enriched for having read it.  It is scholarly without being boorishly so, and resists the chance to take gratuitous potshots at the flimsiest part of the film -- the dialogue.  Lubin rightfully defends writer/director James Cameron's film even at its weakest points, probably because to single out the flimsy and shallow dialogue is to overlook the mastery that went into every other single detail of getting this epic film made.  Visually, it is so rich in detail and craft that to malign it for \\"teen-speak\\" dialogue is just to be petty.  But make no mistake ---  Lubin is not playing the cheerleader for the sake of doing so.  He is carefully examining the film for its comments on class distinctions, its parallels to art and opera, its classic story structure, and how the timing of the making and release of the film is nearly as significant as the timing of the actual sinking from the perspective of changing cultural and social mores.  Or something like that -- Lubin phrases it so much better than I ever could.<br /><br />To those who would chastise Cameron for the dialogue, let's see how well YOU do writing dialogue while simultaneously juggling the 40 thousand details, large and small, of a project this massive!<br /><br />Lubin acknowledges the film's flaws but also pays due heed to the elements that work well, and the film is full of them.<br /><br />Just read the damn book, folks.	2005-06-01

This book, with material assembled from as far back as the late 1970's, is the best band bio book yet!  Alliteration and hyperbole aside, this book is more \\"gloves off\\" and \\"curtain pulled back\\" than any other KISS book out there, and each original band member get his turn (several, in fact) detailing the highlights and lowlights of this band's storied career.  Also contributing MANY anecdotes and opinions are the multiple producers, session players, KISS Organization staffers, management team members, former band members, and peripheral players that had a part in this band's history.  Stuff that Gene and the boys would NEVER publicly admit to in the past are de rigeur confessions here.<br />Absolutely and highly recommended for ALL KISS FANS!  You won't be able to put this book down!	2003-10-29

I still enjoyed reading the story, but the chase scene at the conclusion felt like something from a generic TV movie.<br />Not that a (possible?) movie version would fare any better.  The Crichton novels that have been turned into feature films saw a lot of their scientific and moralistic edges softened considerably.  Too bad, too, because the films were much less interesting than the books as a result.<br />But is &quot;Prey&quot; worth a read?  Oh yeah.  And I anxiously look forward to his next book, whatever it will be.<br />By the way, Crichton is a pretty decent film director, too!!<br />Check out his films:  Runaway (w/Tom Selleck and Gene Simmons), Coma, The Great Train Robbery (w/Sean Connery), Westworld, and Looker.	2003-10-04

What throws another interesting curve into the mix is that the character you presume will be the central character for the whole novel is in fact killed off before the midway point.<br />A major idea/fear expressed in this book, and in Michael Crichton's new novel &quot;Prey&quot;, is that the end of human life on earth will probably not come about as a result of conventional weapons of mass destruction, but rather from more subtle and insidious biological science that we don't have enough perspective to know to NOT tamper with.<br />Good book - a breezy yet thought-stirring work.  Recommended.	2003-09-29

She misquotes several lines and gets the sequence of a few scenes wrong.<br />Granted, she has some interesting things to say about many aspects of the film, and I really enjoyed the book on the whole.  I even underlined a few passages I particularly liked, as geeky as that may sound, but that may be partially attributable to the fact that I am still in college, do a lot of reading for classes, and underline stuff out of habit.<br />As a LONG-time fan of &quot;Jaws&quot; and one who knows that film quite intimately after dozens and dozens of viewings, I can assert with absolute confidence that there are too many misquoted dialogue lines for me to ignore the fact that her research into specific elements of the film was insufficient.  That said, I liked her writing style, and her insight in regard to many areas of the film was fascinating and enlightening.<br />All the BFI Modern Classics entries tend to run about the same number of pages, and in the case of Quirke's discussion of &quot;Jaws&quot;, it is far too few.  I also read the BFI books on &quot;Heat&quot;, &quot;John Carpenter's 'The Thing'&quot;, and have the ones for &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, &quot;Se7en&quot;, and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; on order.  The books are inexpensive enough that if you don't like or agree with the assorted authors you are not going to bemoan the wasted $$.  But if you enjoy them, as I have so far, you will certainly consider the small sums to be money well-spent.	2003-08-22

Plenty of reviews of this book cover the major points I'd want to make in this review, but one interesting facet of the way the events unfold in the book is the point-of-view of the torpedo attack itself.  We get to read narrative accounts in succession from several surviving officers and crew, but the very first account we read is from the point of view of the Japanese sub commander.  We get the cold, hard, wartime mission attack version before we get the frightening accounts of the terror and death from those who suffered it.<br />My introduction to the Indianapolis story was as a 9-year old hearing Robert Shaw's semi-fictional account of it in \\"Jaws\\".  Some details in his monologue were not exactly accurate, but certainly were true to the spirit of the real event.<br />Given the tragic events of the last few years and weeks (the WTC and Pentagon attacks, not to mention the Rhode Island nightclub fire of Feb. 2003 that burned alive nearly 100 concert-goers -- a recent event as I type this), it is horrifyingly simpler now to imagine the kind of fear and sheer terror the sailors on the Indianapolis went through, and to have empathy as well as sympathy.<br />And the bureaucratic process that allowed this tragedy to happen and divert blame for it is shameful.<br />If you aren't familiar with the story of the Indianapolis, grab this book and educate yourself.  These events are too important to be lost to the sands of time, which is an increasing possiblility as the decades march on farther and farther away from World War II.	2003-02-23

So this edition is a quantum leap forward.<br /><br />I challenge you to find a more thorough guide to prime time TV.  This book has everything - down to the minutest detail.

It really is like flipping through an old family album that has been lost to time or stashed away for years.

Decades of drug use, debauchery, infighting, sleeping around, desperation, and show-biz chutzpah are related courtesy of first-hand accounts of the writers, stars, agents, TV executives, staff members, and guests of the show.<br />Not all comments are complimentary, and not all that went on behind the scenes was funny.  But it all makes for a fascinating read, despite the fact that a few notable surviving cast members chose not to participate in these oral interviews.  \\"Live From New York\\" is as much a evolutionary history of the business of television over the past three decades as it is an oral history of the show itself.  Perhaps SNL isn't as consistently cutting edge and counter-culture as it was in its earliest years.  But nowadays the show IS the pop and showbiz culture it lampooned in the past.  It cannot ever really return to its fabled glory days of 1975-1979 because the entire showbusiness landscape has changed so dramatically since then.  One must credit Michaels for recognizing that and still plodding ahead with the show for most of the years since the days of The Not Ready For Prime Time Players.<br />Read this book to find the origins of many of the standard conventions and favorite moments of the show:  why the band always dresses in tuxedos, the inspiration of Danny Aykroyd's buttcrack-exposing refrigerator repairman, the inhuman writing schedule, etc.<br />This is better than an \\"E!

[Money] is a bit much for a book, but this is a limited edition and mine was signed by the band (1995 line-up).  Great historical info and pictures in this book, and you have to appreciate the amount of work that went into assembling all this stuff for the book (though the binding has given many owners some problems).  Superior to its follow-up KISSTORY II.  This book is perhaps better as a collectible than as a gloves-off historical document of the band, but there is a lot in this book to like, even if Gene and Paul do pull some punches about their own troubled and storied career.  Want some more behind-the-scenes stories of the band?  Check out the book KISS AND SELL by C.K. Lendt, available at this website and many others.

At the rate that computer and computation technologies have improved over the last few decades, and the last few years in particular, it is no wonder that some techies posit that computers will soon surpass human intelligence in some areas.  And given the drastic increase in what I've heard referred to as American Anti-intellectualism in recent decades, this may occur sooner rather than later.  The book's jargon may be a bit much for the non-techie reader, but with careful and steady plodding one should be able to get one's head around most of the concepts.  And if the content of the book proves to be too much to digest or comprehend, find comfort and amusement in the fact that the cover of the book is REAL SHINY!!	2002-03-06

A film version might be interesting, but bear in mind that some of the film adaptions of his great books (i.e. \\"The Lost World\\") have been disappointing bastardizations of his talent. I can highly recommend each of the Crichton novels I've read (I've read about 80% of them). Dont miss AIRFRAME, either.	2002-03-04

Have some perspective, guys.<br />I really liked this book.  Gene's gentle and sometimes humorous writing style makes this a pleasure to read.  I've been a KISS fan since I was a 10-year old kid in 1976, and I've read or heard all of the glossed-over stories about the band's inner turmoils.  Finally Gene has taken the gloves off (or at least one of them, perhaps) and let some of the less-flattering truth about KISS's up-and-down career filter through.  Primarily, though, he talks about himself (his favorite topic).  He certainly makes no apologies for his choices or lifestyle (nor should we ask him to), and his rather obvious intelligence certainly shines through.  He managed to guide a band (that would so often be on the verge of self-destruction and collapse) from their humble beginnings on the streets, to the heights of international stardom, to near irrelevance in the 1980's, and back to the top of the (nostalgia) heap in the 1990's.  A helluva ride, and Thank You Gene for letting us tag along.  Most of us who grew up listening to KISS learned a LONG time ago that the \\"Rock and Roll Gods\\" image has its time and place, and that  Gene (just like Paul and Ace and Peter) is basically just another regular guy, although with chutzpah to spare and and an unwavering ambition.  Gene is entitled to be Almost Human like the rest of us.  That means he is allowed to cry, love, regret, and make mistakes like you and me.  He sure does those things, and readily admits it.  KISS is a business as much as it is a band, so how is that any less forgivable than any other celebrity selling him- or herself to stay on top and gainfully employed?  If you weren't already a KISS fan you probably wouldn't be buying or reading this book anyway.  But for the legions of KISS fans everywhere this book is Gene without the make-up - a regular (and singularly driven) guy whose destitute upbringing gave him a sense of perspective on the American Dream that most of us take for granted and even resent when it blesses people other than ourselves.  I don't think Gene is trying to hold himself up as the paragon of success or as a role model to anyone else.  All he is saying in this book is \\"Hey!  I came here with nothing, but thanks to a lot of hard work, a little luck,  and my refusal to run from a fight or let someone else sabotage my dream, I have achieved great success, carved out a name for myself in this world, found true love and happiness as a father and companion, and learned a lot about myself.  And I owe a lot of respect to my Mom!\\"  Sounds like a great success story to me.  Don't let the fact that he did all this through the fickle medium of rock and roll cloud the facts.<br />My only wish is that he had delved into even greater detail about the business end of KISS, as C. K. Lendt did in his excellent book \\"KISS and Sell\\" (available through...).  Not all the KISS years were rosy.  Some were downright embarrassing.  But at least Gene isn't throwing as big a PR spin on those times as he has in other interviews and books - even the fascinating KISSTORY book pulls its share of punches.  But I doubt we'll get much more honest disclosure from any of the band members until after they've hung up their platform boots for good.  Because to do it before then, and let fall some of the sheen of mystique before every last promotional buck has been bled out, would just be bad business.this book is Gene without the make-up - a regular (and singularly driven) guy whose destitute upbringing gave him a sense of perspective on the American Dream that most of us take for granted and even resent when it blesses people other than ourselves.

Very meticulously detailed, it certainly sounds credible. Chris Lendt spent the better part of 12 years as an employee (of sorts) of the KISS organization -- he was a highly placed employee of one of the business firms that managed the band's financial affairs. Lendt even tosses in a few road stories of his own -- part of the perks of touring with the biggest band in the world. It reads as if you are standing backstage or offstage during a KISS tour, and like you are sitting in the boardroom with them during meetings. Lendt takes you inside the organization and lets you inspect it, warts and all. Absolutely fascinating!! You don't have to be a KISS fan to enjoy this book, but if you are already a fan then this book will be an indispensible part of your collection. Read about the minutae, the tiniest of the thousands upon thousands of details of life with a touring rock band. Follow the author and KISS as they skyrocket from hard-working club band to the previously-unexplored heights of international superstardom, and all the pitfalls, trappings and ego stroking that goes with it.<br />Kiss had some great years when they were raking in obscene amounts of money.  But as Lendt points out in lavish detail, the money went out as quickly as it came in.  The Kiss tours were often financial black holes, due either to the outrageous...production costs of touring their larger-than-life stage show, several tours where the ticket buyers stayed home, shady promoters stiffing them out of their guarantees and gate receipts, or a combination of the three.  Gene and Paul knew all along that in rock and roll, image is everything.  They had to always live and spend like kings to maintain the public image that their reputation as rock and roll gods was built on.  But when the lean years set in, and there were plenty of them, their spending habits came back to haunt them over and over and over again.  Lesser bands would have packed up their tents and called it a day, but Gene and Paul refused.  So they took their financial lumps again and again.  The Reunion Tour of 1996-1997 may well have been the only thing to keep them off food stamps in their retirement years.<br />Chris Lendt's book gives a far more honest look at the inner workings of the \\"business of KISS\\" than any other source I've seen or heard of.  Peter Criss was essentially paid to leave the band.  Ace Frehley's departure was unfortunately timed for KISS, as it left them in such a precarious position with their new record company contract that the whole thing could have collapsed on them and left them penniless and in debt for heaven knows how long.  South American and Mexican promoters dangled big payday carrots in front of them so rich that KISS couldn't afford to turn them down, at a time when the band's financial situation was extremely dire, only to have the deals collapse time after time in spectacular fashion.  KISS spent years playing to half-filled houses, releasing poor-performing records, and still pouring untold [amount] into touring to maintain the public image of what was termed in-house as SuperKiss.  Kiss was borrowing money from any source they could, leveraging themselves to the hilt, all the while shutting their ears to the more practical financial advice that came from their business managers.  Kiss had become a cautionary tale.<br />Chris Lendt saw his ties to KISS rather unceremoniously severed when the band fired their business managers (Lendt's employers) over a decade ago.  But Lendt appears to carry no grudges.

The Reunion Tour of 1996-1997 may well have been the only thing to keep them off food stamps in their retirement years.  <BR>Chris Lendt's book gives a far more honest look at the inner workings of the \\"business of KISS\\" than any other source I've seen or heard of.  Peter Criss was essentially paid to leave the band.  Ace Frehley's departure was unfortunately timed for KISS, as it left them in such a precarious position with their new record company contract that the whole thing could have collapsed on them and left them penniless and in debt for heaven knows how long.  South American and Mexican promoters dangled big payday carrots in front of them so rich that KISS couldn't afford to turn them down, at a time when the band's financial situation was extremely dire, only to have the deals collapse time after time in spectacular fashion.  KISS spent years playing to half-filled houses, releasing poor-performing records, and still pouring untold [amount] into touring to maintain the public image of what was termed in-house as SuperKiss.  Kiss was borrowing money from any source they could, leveraging themselves to the hilt, all the while shutting their ears to the more practical financial advice that came from their business managers.  Kiss had become a cautionary tale.<br />Chris Lendt saw his ties to KISS rather unceremoniously severed when the band fired their business managers (Lendt's employers) over a decade ago.  But Lendt appears to carry no grudges.  He always spoke lovingly of the band members and of his 12 year association with the group, even after being dismissed. <br /> Lendt's unique \\"insider\\" position makes for a fascinating education about the business of show business!	2001-10-30

His accounts of the production horrors, mishaps, over-runs, local hysteria (all these on a GOOD day of shooting) are as entertaining as the film itself.  A great in-depth companion to the too-short documentary featured on the &quot;Jaws&quot; DVD (that documentary itself a shortened version of the spectacular one included in the Laserdisc Collector's Edition from the mid-1990's).	2001-10-30

It was a heck of a battle, and some folks didn't exactly play fair. Letterman, by far the more deserving of the &quot;King of Late Night&quot; crown following Carson's unceremonious ousting, tried to win by being the best at what he does. Leno's camp won by using strongarm tactics, bullying, and underhandedness. Even Leno's show &quot;borrows&quot; rather heavily from Dave's old show, partly because his people lured Letterman's chief writers to their side. Leno may be a decent guy (I hear), but his management quite literally stole The Tonight Show for him. Dave was hoping to be let in through the front door, but Leno's camp broke in through a window. The companion HBO movie treatment of this book is also a very entertaining and enlightening dramatization of the basics of this ordeal.	2001-09-24

Not that we all need too much reminding of that nowadays, though.<br />The examples are many, but are juicier (if that word is appropriate) in the second half of the book.<br />After you read this you'll wonder how ANYTHING ever gets accomplished anymore, especially in NYC.<br />Watch the movie &quot;...And Justice For All&quot; to get your blood pumping, then read this book to get your blood vessels to actually burst.  It'll make you want to emigrate to another country at times.	2001-08-21

The highlight for me was a short essay called MAN OF STEEL -- WOMAN OF KLEENEX, about the physiological impracticality and impossibility of Superman mating with a human female.  Hilarious!! Even if you don't love &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi, you should find this collection of works to be simultaneously thought-provoking and entertaining.	2001-08-21

This book (with contributions from Jerry Seinfeld - some people claim Seinfeld and Ted L. Nancy are one and the same) had me laughing out loud, too.  These letters give a new definition to Domestic Terrorism.	2001-07-02

Some readers find his books impenetrable.  But OMAHA is a delightfully funny departure from most of his other novels.  Granted, humor is subjective.  And many of his loyal readers may be a bit put off by this book.  But for the otherwise unenlightened, this is a soft introduction to Mr. Ludlum's often intricate and layered storytelling.  Good fun, but reading it can tax you in spots.	2001-07-02

When software and PC development went from garage hobby to BIG BUSINESS many of its finer nuances and greatness fell to the wayside.

Amazon.com was closing in on 700 published reviews of this book when I started typing mine, so you can imagine the kind of response this novel has garnered from the public!<br />I hope you can get through this book in one sitting, because if you can't you will suffer the same fate that befell my friend Kristen and myself.  When we had to put the book down, unfinished, we couldn't stand being in a different room from it.<br />At once comic, tragic, spiritual, and downright eccentric, APFOM will ensconce John Irving in the upper pantheon of great contributors to 20th century literature.  There's not much else to say here that hasn't been said a couple of hundred times already on this website.  This book is a treasure, and all who read it will be rewarded by its enriching, graceful, yet odd story.	2000-11-13

It helps to be as familiar with Carlin's stage delivery, so that you can more or less &quot;hear&quot; this material in his voice and intonation.  But you will laugh, regardless.  Only from the brilliant mind of Mr. Carlin will you hear/read such observational gems!!<br />I gotta wonder if having a sense of perception and observation like his is a blessing or a curse.  I guess he is still about as &quot;counterculture&quot; as counterculture can be nowadays, but he is also has an incisive, intelligent mind, make no mistake!  And he is politically incorrect not for shock's sake, but because he has his b.s. meter on at all times and isn't afraid to comment on it.  Not all of the material translates well to written form, but if you can &quot;hear&quot; it in his voice, it is like having Carlin the Master give a command performance just for you.	2000-11-13

Reading Wurtzel's book is like having a friend's shoulder to cry on.  ...More therapeutic than psychotherapy, and a helluva lot cheaper.  Thank you, Elizabeth Wurtzel, for so eloquently and wittily putting this  oft-misunderstood pain in such sharply written focus.  Depression can be  unimaginably debilitating, yet Wurtzel still lets us laugh a bit, at her  own expense -  and that sure cuts through a lot of the loneliness and  despair that permeates the life of a Depression sufferer.  Just knowing  that someone else is able to help you &quot;vocalize&quot; the agony is a  comfort, and Wurtzel speaks for many of us in this brutally honest memoir.  If you suffer from Depression and are having difficulty explaining its  power over your life to your loved ones, make them read this book.  &quot;Here!  THIS is my pain.&quot;  Insightful, revealing, funny, tragic  and, most of all, a godsend to folks like me.  I'm gonna give Wurtzel a  big hug if I ever meet her.  Apparently actress Christina Ricci has  optioned the film rights to this book and plans to make a movie from it.  But don't wait for the movie.  Buy the book for yourself or for someone who  needs to learn about how deadly Depression can be.	2000-03-23
